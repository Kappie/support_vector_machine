Is that a result of them being flat, or Calgary being that good?  I didn't follow too much of the regular season, so how did Calgary end up with such a low seed when they are so good? Surprising.    I hope Tampa comes back and at least makes a series of it, but if they keep on playing like this, it might be short.  I'm always conflicted in the finals.  It's great to watch, but I hate the knowledge that the whole season ends after this.  You get hooked on always having a quality game to watch almost every night.  Then nothing but baseball.....ugh.
