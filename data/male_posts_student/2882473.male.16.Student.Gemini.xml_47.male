I've done a little revision for it. Well, I memorised the presentation, and had a glance over some practice questions. I really should probably have done more, but hey! It's only German. If I fail (I won't fail) then I fail. But I'm not feeling too bad about it, my practice went ok. And the good presentation should get me a few marks even if I do totally bugger up the 6 minute conversation. Bugger Bugger Bugger Bugger Bugger Bugger.   Reading:  Interesting Times  Listening to:  Some documentary about storms in the background...  Watching:  Nothing really  Confused about:  German Oral techniques... hehe  Annoyed with:  Myself, for not revising more.  Mood:  Not too woried, but I should be.
