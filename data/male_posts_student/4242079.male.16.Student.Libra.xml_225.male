The CEO and the President of Sales are both going to be in my store today. IN MY STORE. This thrills me to no end (sense the sarcasm). So. Today, all the hard work and effort I have put in to making the store look like a store and not a storeroom, will be told that it's not good enough and that we should work harder. Maybe I'll just crash my car into the back of a truck so I can spend the day in the hospital instead.  I talked to Phaedra last night. She's a good kid. Even though she didn't get a birthday tribute like Shyla, I love Phaedra. I love all of you. Take a bullet for any of you, ya know.  Well. I suppose I'll post when I return.
