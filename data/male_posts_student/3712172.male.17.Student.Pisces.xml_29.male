Anyways, it went alright, but the bad news is that my mom's boyfriends father passed away today. He was 91, and he wasn't doing too well, he's been in and out of the hospital even before I did my co-op placement.   Although we know he's in a better place now, it's going to toughen a lot of things up. The process of moving is going to be backed up I think due to funeral arrangements and what not. It happened to much at the wrong time as well, we have all been stressed and my mom and her boyfriend have been stressed and pouring money into that new house, and now this. It's like at times life really bites you in the ass. Even though I wasn't very close with his father, I have talked to him numerous times, and visited him in the hospital before I started work there during school. He was a very religious and kind man, and it's going to be hard for his family and friends to let him go, he was a very well known individual.  So the day has just turned, thinking mode sets in and I sit and feel guilty that someone just died, but yet I am walking around fully healthy doing whatever I please. I just can't believe death when it happens, I dislike it so much, and it makes me feel weird and unstable.  I don't have much else to say, I feel to weird, and wiped out to type more. I did, however, write two poems last night. Here's the one I liked the most...   Transition  Emotional distress, as it possesses my only known truth. Hurting and bleeding, in the depths of my one true self. I am not depressed, nor am I cheerful. My soul hurts, my heart burns, struggling with comprehension.  Attempting to figure out if this transition is a burden, Or if the transition is positive at this time and point. To be unable to relate with most people I know, To be ridiculed for my morals, ethics and thoughts.  I am not ashamed, nor am I completely content, My mind is in it's own state of contradiction, Confused, yet amazed that I have grown this way. Distinguishing meanings, pondering thoughts.  The fact that it must be done alone, Has to be yet a burden in itself. Relations are untrue, could this be wrong? Emotions grow sore, and trying is not worth it.  Acceptance has overcome my new self, Relating to the others is the problem. I stand for what I stand for. And its final, that's good enough for me.
