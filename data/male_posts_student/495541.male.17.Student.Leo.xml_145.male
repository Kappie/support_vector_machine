I remember reading something or hearing something someone said about weblogs and how he or she hates them because they're only about people who don't have lives and just blabber about their problems.  Well to that I say that sometimes people don't have people they can talk about their problems to, or they just can't think of them or... "Go ahead.. make my day"  Ok, I was just watching some Clint Eastwood movie.  Anyways yeah people just blabber and the guy doesn't like this.  To that I say if you don't like it, the I guess you don't have to read it.  I don't know what made me think of that but I just did.  Alright so today was alright, it was good, I think.  Nothing went wrong.  Everything went pretty good except the fact that I have a lot of homework.  I hate homework.  I wish life were easier and we could all get our learning done in class.  People would be so much smarter if that were the case.  Blah blah.  I need to go to bed.  I need to do my homework.  Good night.
