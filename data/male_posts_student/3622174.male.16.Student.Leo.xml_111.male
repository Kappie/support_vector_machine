Well, that's because mainly, I'm too freakin' lazy to turn on my media player.  So, this new monthly feature will tell you what I'm listening to.  So, here's my first list for this month:  5. Midtown- Give it Up 4. Hoobastank- Did You 3. lostprophets- Lucky You 2. Yellowcard- Gifts and Curses 1. Incubus- Drive  Most of those are from the Spiderman 2 soundtrack, which actually turned out pretty good, for a movie soundtrack.  And that's what I'm listening to now.  Blog of Bagel LIVE is coming at the end of the month.  Every day from July 19-22, expect audio posts that will start off with "Coming to you LIVE from ______ in Orlando, FL..."  This is because all of my posts will be audio while I'm off at camp, and since I'm addicted to the Bl0gg3r, I want to make it sound good.  I'll have at least two posts a day, maybe three, depending on when I have my "hidden cell phone" segments, where my unsuspecting yearbook buddies may do something stupid and have it on audioblog!  Its something creative and original, and I can't wait to try it!  Later tonight, join me for my 100th post on Blogger.  It'll have Late Night Bloggin and more.  It'll be around 11:30 tonight, depending on when I get done with work.  So, enjoy!
