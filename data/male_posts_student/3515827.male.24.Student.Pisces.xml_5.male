I didn't have the sound on during most of Ron Reagan's speech, I started to listen to it but the delivery was awful.  He had this look on his face and sound in his voice that turned me off.  Obama was wonderful, what a great speaker he truly is.  I know that everyone in the Democratic side has high expectations for him, and I can understand why.   I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors who won't be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I had met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but still lacked long-term health benefits because they were Reservists.  When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they are going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never, ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace and earn the respect of the world...........  ......Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes.  Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America.  There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America.  The pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue States: red states for Republicans, blue States for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states.  We coach little league in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states.  There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq, and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq.  We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.   And then there was Teresa Heinz-Kerry, what a firecracker.  It's nice to have a potential first lady that is more than just a quite token,with a carved out smile holding back her Valium.  Even my Grandmother likes Heinz-Kerry, and she hates Hillary.  Funny enough she actually likes Bill.   Her: Did you watch the convention last night? Me: No, I had to work, so I missed it. Her:Well, Clinton gave a really great speech, he's such a smart man.  And he is so handsome, he was wearing a beautiful suit and tie. Me: Yeah, he's lost some weight too I think. Her: He has lost a lot of weight.  Well, no, not a lot, not too much.  He looked so good though.  But that Hillary, she looked as awful and dopey as ever.
