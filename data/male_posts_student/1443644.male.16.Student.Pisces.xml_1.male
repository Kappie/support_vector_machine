As you all know (unless you have been living in some underground world) it is summer, and summer holds no secrets, and nor do I. The past month has been less than uneventful, but I will give you a quick summary. I started my summer off in Cape Cod with my cousins, it was fun, but they kind of were too busy oogling the locals while I was left oogling nothing cause Ptown is like the gay capital of the world, so there were very few girls, and the ones that were there were drag queens and lesbians. Now don't get me wrong here, I am not a homophobe or anything, I was just pissed cause there were no girls that I chill with... There never are. Once I got back from the Cape I was off to Maine for the fourth of July. It was kind of fun, but my friends from New York also dumped me, but this time for tourists, which is even worse then the locals! Once again I was alone, because Ogunquit is also known for its gay and elderly population, and I do not like my ladies wrinkly... Man, I always get hosed when I am on vacation because we never go places where there are straight people my age of the opposite sex! Well, anyways... I have been home ever since. I crashed a few parties, but they were more or less drink and run because my parents all of a sudden need to know everything (since Joanna's party... which I forgot to tell them I was staying over for). Other than that things have been pretty uneventful... I went to the mall with Kelsey, that was an adventure... I also went to the mall with Sam, but she kind of decided to hang out with her friends/cousins that were there, leaving me kind of out... I am always the odd wheel out! Why can't I have someone to even things out? Why cant I find a girl who wants to be more than just friends? I already have enough "just" girlfriends, and it is beginning to suck because all I really want to do I have someone who is... Mine. I have had my eye on someone for years, and I cant seem to remove them... Which is really holding me down, but then again, I haven't really been attracted to the other choices... I am afraid to make the first move, because I am unsure of her status, and I don't want to wreck our growing friendship. Why does this world have to be so unclear?
