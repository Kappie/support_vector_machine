(maybe my meds i upped the dose... and am taking one 75mg. instead of two 37.5 mg.) whatever... i just hope it doesn't last because i want to be happy and excited and i really am but just don't feel like i have the energy to be... And finally... school... is finally coming to a close and ... for the most part... besides sucking huge donkey cock... is slowly getting better and by that i mean... its almost done so i guess i can put up with it for now... lets hope i make it to the end because... while it may only be 9 days or something like that... i dont know if i can hang on that long... ok... im going to get some sleep.. and maybe... ill be myself tomorrow... pray for me...  Nate
