Like a gardener waiting for his rose to bloom; Leads to a foreshadowing of self-destruction and doom; So there lies the suppressed genius of many of our generation; The devastation of a proclamation hardly ever to enforce; Frustratingly and over embellished like course; An everlasting obstacle in which we are not allowed to overcome; So there are our gifts, Unused and numb... Thank you.
