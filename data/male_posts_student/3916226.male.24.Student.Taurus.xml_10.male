It was an awakening of the inner self.. undescribable...if youve'nt witnessed it on your own... Barricades open themselves and let tehe flood gates barge in to bury away...  Life gives you another chance to get back at the stuff you want to .. if u hang around with the will long enough.. It kinda tends to show you that amidst all the storms that it can brew up if u persevere...  Honestly it's been a while since some kinda inner tranquility has been restored... atleast temporarily.. It felt good... and it's been so long since that has happened...
