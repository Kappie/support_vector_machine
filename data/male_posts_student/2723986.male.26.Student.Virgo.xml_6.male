Right now it’s Saturday morning and I’m typing away while sitting precariously on the edge of my chair (Stimpy, my cat, is currently using 2/3rds of it as a bed).  I just got done typing up a response to the infamous “let’s start a new argument” thread over at Thunderbolt, which has turned into one big bash on the mathematical method of deriving an final score in a review.  Good points have been made thus far, and only time will tell if I’ll end up being swayed over to the dark side of Zen-like score assigning.  Hrmph.  As far as gaming is concerned, I’m still playing Viewtiful Joe quite a bit, but I’ll also almost all the way through PN 03.  Carrying a decidedly old school flavor, PN 03 is good, clean fun, but I question its long-term value.  Maybe beating it will unlock something incredibly amazing, like the option to play as a mecha Tony the Tiger or something similar.  I also picked up TimeSplitters 2 for the Cube during the week, and actually managed to get Rebecca to do a little co-op with me.  Score!  For the past month now I have been terrible at making it in to the gym on any kind of regular basis.  Right now I’m going to set a goal to get back to my old routine, which consisted of going 3-4 times a week.  One of the reasons I haven’t been in as much is because my membership is now at 24-hour fitness, and that place is always packed with people.  Lacamas Swim and Sport, a closer gym to my house that I get in free at because I know everyone there, might be a better bet if I want to get back into a steady routine.  On a somewhat related note, Barry Bonds is on the Juice.  What a dummy.  And I'm out.
