I am open about my life, but not sure I have the right to reveal other people's. Though they're the people that read this. Anyway, I'll get to this later too. Life was not so good when I got back. Need to remember to do the foreign love word blog too. Okay, this, too, will be edited.  Lissa is more active. It seems she is all over Kelly (emotionally) because Kelly was her friend first and I am hanging out with Kelly more now. It's not even really about Kelly. That shocks me. I mean, Elissa's immaturity shows she still cares about me, but she doesn't act it at all. She merely gets mad at me for everything I do. I'm really really trying to be nice. I always mean well. She says I say cruel things though. Doesn't matter what I mean, she says I shouldn't beat her up like I do. A joke about Monday Football being a fun thing to do was one such annoyance. I don't get it. She is completely running from all her feelings. She refuses to think about things. Maybe I was the only influence in her life that led her to question things. Anyway, it's not looking good. And as much as there is some immature side that wouldn't mind her tearing herself apart, I will be living with her. Times are weird. I'm still not sleeping. But thanks Lisa for giving me something to do while not sleeping in Houston. I don't have anyone with me here, it was a nice change.  Yeah, it's later now.  Still not into editing or fixing, so this'll stay like this.  Lisa says write more about how I feel, but it seems I've reverted back into talking about others.  There's less in my again.  At least, less than I need to think through.  I have the usual controlable emotions now.  Just gotta diversify and move on with my life.  Do more productive things.  Have a greater variety of friends to lean on.  I like the friends I have and they're enough, but it's not the most stable situation ever.  We'll see what happens.  The patience game is not my forte.
