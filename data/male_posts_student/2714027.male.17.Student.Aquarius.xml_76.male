For me, it all seemed straightforward and hopefully a good mark will drag my overall grade up to a B which I'm hoping to get. Computing was in the afternoon, two 1h30 papers which were incredibly simple, lacking any hard questions on binary or parts of the processor. The papers didn't even last the whole time, with everyone finished in an hour or less. I think I just got myself an A.  Saturday was spent at work, which wasn't too bad and was mainly spent doing odd jobs building things, tiding up and lifting items into peoples' cars. After work, I went home, got changed, checked the football score (2-0 to Greece against Portugal!) and then went up to the village picnic for some food. Let me explain slightly; my parents are both parish councillers, so I get dragged along to every village event imaginable, but then so do children of similar age, so it's not all bad. I spend the evening up there, chatting to old friends and those who I don't see so often, which is always good.  Today I'm going to be doing some Physics revision for Monday's three exams, then watch the football (Euro 2004; Switzerland v Croatia and England v France). Tune in for more soon...
