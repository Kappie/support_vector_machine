That was cool, he was getting recognized for his Eagle also.  I also saw Mr. and Mrs. Byer there, I talke to them a little bit.  Then my dad got two awards.  He got the soutmaster's key, which was a lot of work for him to get.  He also got the district award of merit, which he did not know that he was getting it.  The wife of the recipient gets a call, and so one of our freinds that was going took my mom after my dad and I had left.  It was cool, and i think that he really deserves it.  It was a pretty good night.  Not really interesting, but goood.  Well, i will talk to you all later.  See ya!
