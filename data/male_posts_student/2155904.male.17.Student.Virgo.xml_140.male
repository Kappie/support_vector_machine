The school day was incredibly long but just talking with Purdy, Amed, Dotti, Dr. Phil, Macaroon, Kinker, Piggy J, and Haras made it all worthwhile.  And so did the nightlife.  After school Tyke came home and took out the garbage.  Then he played ESPN.  At about 7:30 the boys came over.  Macaroon and then Kinker that is.  Tyke was down 2-0 in Shithead games but somehow he came back to win the series 3-2.  Then he kept his roll going by not losing 5 more consecutive games and thus taking his streak to 8 straight.  Which is very impressive with only 3 people playing.  The odds are he will lose once.  And he beat the odds.  So they played that for a while.  And watched some of the real March Madness.  Then DCups and Team Jeu came over for poka.  It was fun.  $5 buy-ins unlimitedly.  Tyke only put 5 in the pot and he played very well all night.  Played the right hands.  And he came out with 21 bucks.  A very nice night indeed.  Dr. Phil joined the fray late but he wasn't a winner.  Tyke, Kinker, and fake jew all won money with fake coming out with about 30.  It was a great time though.  Then, on a spurge of the moment decision the gang decided to go down to Denny's.  So Tyke snuck out at about 12:20 and left his back door open so he could get back in without making noise.  They went to Denny's and got some grub and it was good.  The service was bad as usual but there was this one chick that was pretty hot and Tyke and DCups could not figure out why she was working at Denny's for the midnight shift.  She should have been working somewhere non-Denny's like.  Not like Hooters but just something more respectable than Denny's.  No offense intended really but still.  She was pretty.  And she spoke English so that wasn't it.  It was quite a canundrum.  But Tyke should probably go to bed.  So he will.  This kind of night would be fun to have on an actual school day.  Maybe that day will come sometime this year.  But now sleep comes.
