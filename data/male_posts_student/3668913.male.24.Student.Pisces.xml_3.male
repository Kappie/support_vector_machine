I have been thinking of whether or not to set up my own blog over the last few months, especially after reading through some of my friends'blogs and entries. While most of them are pretty interesting and some do reflect certain aspects of their lives which I have never known, some are just erm.... more like reading their resume?? Well, I have now decided to take a step of faith and plunge myself into doing this blog and hopefully, talent scouts can see the entries (and buy the rights to my blog for a million bucks and used it as a script for a Hollywood movie). Hahaha....  Hmm.. it kind of feel weird to type all these things and allowing people to see what has been written. It is almost like I am standing in front of them and allowing them to scrutinise everything in me, such as my pimples, my fats, my shortcomings etc. However, it is also a time for me to really put my thoughts in a way that my friends can see without inhibitions. Hopefully, this blog will not just turn out to be just another self glorifying, self promoting kind of website, but really a chance for me to be brutally honest of my own life and the grace of God upon my life. Certainly, I believe in this, that I am just an ordinary guy being used by an extraordinary God.When I was in the army, there was this saying (by our seniors, not our officers) that we are the unfortunate, led by the unqualified, to do the unnecessary, for the ungrateful. Well.... in life, I believe that when we obey and serve our Creator God with our best, certainly, we will maximise our potential!
