I tried to play a few songs...but its almost impossible, as I broke one of the strings that is most played...  Prior to that; today  urlLink Ashley  brought out a couple of real Oklahoma girls! Their names were Pepper (16 yrs) and Holly (15 yrs). They were pretty cute...hope Jadie doesn't kill me! ;)  We went bowling, Jadie, Ashley, Holly, Pepper, and Ashley's sister Cathy. I won the second game, and Jadie won the first. Pepper and Holly had never bowled in their lives!  All in all I think Oklahoma girls are all right...and they even said ya'all a few times. Here are some pictures of us, Holly is in the brown, and Pepper is in the red. Ashley is in the yellow, and Cathy is in the light brown. My dad is also in the last picture.    urlLink      urlLink      urlLink
