Saw League of Extroadinary gentlemen today... it was actiony. Sean Connery was cool... hold on... ill finish in a sec... gotta watch conan  (30 minutes later)  It was a rerun :(. Anyway, where was I? Oh yes.  Sean Connery was also actioney. Everything he said was cool, and everything he did was cooler.   Punch! Punch! Action Phrase! Shoot! Punch!  ~change subject~  Tomata, (or this morning), my dad and I are gonna go down to Home Depot and get PVC for a drumbone :-D whooOO! This is gonna be so cool. I wanna do a performance with it, but i dont know where, or where im gonna find a drummer, bassist, guitarist, AND 3 people to hold the drumbone. I will sooner or later, tho. :-D  Oh, here's an amusing anec-dote.  On the way home from Extroadinary gentlemen, my dad asked me what was my favorite "extroadinary gentleman." I tried to say Sean Connery, but i messed up and said Shonery. So thats what I'm gonna call him from now on.  Tobey Macguire is The Tobe Kevin Bacon is The Bacon Sean Connery is Shonery.  :-D  Soon I'll find a way to post pictures of drumbone construction on this journal, so stay tuned!
