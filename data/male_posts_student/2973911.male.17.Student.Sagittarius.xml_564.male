Trip ko rin naman magbutingting ng computer. I know it's not exactly the kind of course that will last a lifetime but I'll take it anyway. I'll add in a few programming courses. Afterwards, I'm going to get my masteral and doctorate degree. Maybe get a minor in psychology just so I can finally understand what exactly is behind what I do at times. Ayun!
