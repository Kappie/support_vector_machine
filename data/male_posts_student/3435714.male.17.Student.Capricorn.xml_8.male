Am I affected by "emotions" Ive cared for people, ive hated people, ive missed people, ive even loved people. But, now this very second, do I feel "emotions" any longer? I wish the answer was as easy as Yes or No... I have run out of road, mentally  emotionally. I had one of those things I thought would last forever, But its gone now...Completely GONE! What will I do now? Will I srtive on? Become a recluse? Will I sease to exist? I will strive on, I have to  will. I will "Float On" as a certain song out now says. This perticular song has been my crutch for the last month.  "And We'll all float on ok,  Yeah We'll all float on ok,  And we'll all float on anyway." "Alright already well al float on,  Even if things get a bit to heavy well all float on ok."      Thats the chorus to the song Float On by Modest Mouse,      It means that things are gonna happen in your life      That are bad and you cant control that...      So you have the choice to let the thing rule you...      Or you remain cheerful and "float on"      I have decided to float on. Cause if 1 bad thing that happend in your life would cause it to end, Im sure 3/4 of us would have died a long time ago. So if this seemed as a pointless jumble of run-ons to you. And it has no uplifting value to you at ALL. Nwxt time your having a bad day, listen to Modest Mouses' song "FLOAT ON" and if your anything like me, it should cheer you up  bring some encouagement to you in a bad time.
