I’d gather all my friends around, we’d have bets (“Alright Amir, whom’re ya puttin’ your money on? Shirts or skins?”). Only problem is resources, where would I get all that PVC? Getting’ kids is no problem, my uncle Gin must have approximately  millions  and  millions  and  millions  and  millions  and  millions  (which actually adds up to a billion) by now.
