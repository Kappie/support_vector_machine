I figured I should do this before I get really tired tonight and think of it as more of a chore than something I  want  to do, which it isn't. That was kind of confusing. I want to do it, but I don't want it to feel like a chore and I know it will when I'm really tired tonight. Anyway, these're the next two posts that I wrote as far as I could tell.  January 28th, 2004  With days like these who needs days?  Status and reflection on the past few days  As I said in It was Cloudy I haven't left the house consistently for a little more than a few days in a row and it's really starting to get to me. It's bed-time now and I'm listening to The Postal Service as usual, which doesn't have a saddening effect on me, but for some reason I feel depressed now and I think I need to get out more...  I think that when ones hygiene and mental state are at risk, one should go out and it doesn't matter where. Perhaps I'll do that tomorrow, but knowing me, It won't happen until someone drags me out of this place by the ears. So what will most likely happen is I will end up being further depressed and end up looking, feeling, and acting like shit when the time for volunteer orientation at UCLA comes around.  I'm gonna hope for the best and try not to let the bright blue glow of the LCD in a dark room get to me. 	>> meowMix   January 28th, 2004  Do you see me going around saying...  The womens' "poor me", "we're gonna rise up against the men attitude" and how I'm sick of it.  Here I am sitting at my TiBook curious if I got anything in the mail so I unassumingly start up Mail and what do I find but an e-mail from my father's aunt talking about how women rising to power is freakin' us men out and making us scared. I've had a problem with messages like this nearly forever but before I get labeled as a chauvinist please hear me out.  While I can't speak for all men, I feel that I can safely say for myself that I am glad that women are having a more prominent role in society than they previously had and I admit that past society has been oppressive to their gender. However, I do NOT appreciate it when people, women or men who feel that they have to somehow over-compensate for the actions of the generations before them by writing articles saying that women are somehow better than men or that the majority of men have some big, demonic plan to control them and make sure they can't do anything more than wash the dishes and raise the kids.  I take no responsibility for the actions of the generations before me and I don't think that others should either. It is for this reason, among others, that I get offended by the descendants of holocaust survivors suing companies that helped the nazis for their actions over 50 years ago, or worse, suing companies that didn't even exist at the time.  Anyway, the point I mean to make is that I'm sick of people acting like I have some big evil plan to keep women down because of my own insecurities. And if I ever say or even hint at the fact that the world is becoming emasculated then I must somehow be a primitive cave-man chauvinist who thinks women should sweep all day. The fact of the matter is that I hope that women and men can be on the same field and there not be any animosity on either side. I mean, you don't see me going around saying that men are great all the time for 'x' and 'y' reason.  All that I ask is that the whole "feminist" movement shut their traps for a bit and think about how current generations feel towards women, rather than looking back 4k years and pointing their fingers excitedly as if to make a point about the modern world. Please, grow up, look at your current situation, think of ways to improve the future, and (PLEASE) don't mourn over the past. 	>> meowMix  That concludes this installment of 'Blast From The Past'. Check back for tomorrow's episode.  Well, I think that just about covers the purpose of this post. If there was anything that bugs you about either of the posts, good for you. This was me about 5 or 6 months ago and I change a lot fast and often, so just keep that in mind. I will write another tonight about today that might contain some kind of reflection. These things often do.  That is all. -- Feanor
