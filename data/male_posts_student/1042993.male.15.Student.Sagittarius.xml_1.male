Apple has a reputation for ripping people off with RAM and other storage options with their Apple Store.  I recommend two good places for buying RAM for Apple computers.   urlLink Mac Mall  .  Mac Mall offers great Apple products at an affordable price.  Check out their G5's! (Great price).   urlLink Crucial  .  Crucial has been known for many years for having reliable options for RAM and other storage.
