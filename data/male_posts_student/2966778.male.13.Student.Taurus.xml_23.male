Aren't "eight-tracks" from the eighties or seventies or whatever?  I mean Sony made the CD, big deal.  Why make it 74 minutes long?  I don't know.  I'm sorry Sony, but you'rre gona have to move and let Apple take it's place.  Apple shall rule!  Ye inferior companies shall fall and thy Apple shall rise to the top!  Funny how I've written two posts about my two favorite companies (that's correct isn't it?), Apple and Google, are trying to be overcome by my former favorite companies (that's right, right?), Sony and Yahoo!.  (Yes, I know I did two punctuations there.)   urlLink iPod Garage: McDonald's and Sony: a super-size catastrophe
