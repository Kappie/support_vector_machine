I did pretty sucky on the left turn around the island part and the straight backing across the curb part.  But I did do well on parallel parking.  Kudos... to me!  After that, Rod picked me up and we were off to work.  In the rain.  At Gary's demand.  And started to mow.  At Gary's demand.  And stopped mowing 20 minutes later.  At Gary's demand.  I was really wet by then.  So then we packed the crap up.  And got lunch at Ameristar.  Then we went to Gary's place, moved some shit for him (like 80 lb dumbbells).  Rod was struggling on deadlifting one in each hand, it was funny.  But the guy is pretty tough, no less.  We did some curls and benching and ping pong.  Went back to the units, unpacked the mower, hitched it up to the trailer/truck, and rode to Herr und Frau Schubert's to mow.  Then went back home.  8 hours, oh yeaah.  I'm kinda pissed that I ruined my (admittedly crappy) Megadeth Shirt with the demons on it.  Meh!  And how Rod and Gary talk about "innapropriate" things all the time.  Its almost sickening.  Well, I reinstalled UT thanks to Adam, who is Jesus Christ.  Blessed be the gifts of CD's brought upon by thee.  And whatnot.  God, I have no idea what to do now.  Maybe install UT updates.
