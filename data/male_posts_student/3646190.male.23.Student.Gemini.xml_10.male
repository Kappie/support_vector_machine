But if you want to follow the conv just go to this link http://bol-desi-bol.blogspot.com/2004/06/why-this-now.html#comments.  First, thanks for the interest Shariq, it is greatly appreciated. Also whatever I am going to comment on—I just want to be clear—is with respect. I am going out of my way to say this because the Internet is this weird space where emotions and tone are rarely effectively communicated.   So…..  I am not looking at life and things in general from a Muslim perspective. I stopped a long time ago. I look at everything in life from an Anarchist lens which might seem like we are comparing apples and oranges but is not the case.   Shariq: We know that things happen according to Gods design, and situations wont stop until God wills.  I have always believed God is in the wrong if he has allowed this suffering to take place. That was well before I was an Anarchist and that is one of the reasons I never bought into Islam or other religions. My instincts tell me that is not right. I don’t care if there is a heaven and people will forget their suffering on Earth. You cannot and should not forget the past. That is a putting a veil on our existence. And I know many Muslims always say you cannot possibly understand the reasoning behind God and coincidently that is always their excuse for not doing anything to help others or helping themselves (besides the usual I am going to become a rich doctor). I would much rather burn in hell with revolutionaries who did not believe in God or were not Muslims, then be in heaven with  Muslims who prayed five times a day but did not go on the front lines to fight for social and economic justice.   I think Shariq mentioned one of the reasons why activists burn out, but there are many more. At least in my case, it was due to not taking care of my own personal life and a community that looked down upon what I was doing. Regardless of the importance of doing what one wants without letting the opinions of others effect you, humans are still social beings, and when aunts and uncles and your own parents remind you that you are a fuck up just because you chose to be a teacher in the inner city, you wear your hear long, go to protests, spend time doing political work instead of studying for the MCAT—it really sucks and can be the soil for alienation.  Shariq: A Muslim, on the other hand, isn’t so much concerned with changing the situation as he is with doing what’s right.  Activists are concerned with what is right as well. But most revolutionaries ( I am going to speak from that angle because not all activists are revolutionaries.) base their sense of right on working class politics which is radically different than Islam or other religions. If Islamic morality and sense of right was inspired from the divine, then revolutionary “morality” and a sense of right is derived from the practical social and economic conditions of the day and how it affects working people. I think that is one of the reasons Islam has largely been incompetent in the post-industrial world because it has not been able to understand capitalism and how it works. Also most revolutionaries do not believe in an afterlife or God, so what they have on Earth is everything, so I can understand when they do not see improvement in the conditions of humanity, they burnout.   Regarding alienation:  My alienation from the Muslim community began when I saw that the community’s reputation was more important than having a drug program at the Masjid, when a “respected and wise” brother told me that some things are better hidden. My alienation began when people would only go to Friday prayer and I saw it meant nothing to them. My alienation began when the Imam did not once mention what was happening in Iraq, Palestine, in the United States and demand that Muslims make some sort of fight. My alienation began when I saw the racism of Muslims. I have a very long list.  There was a time when I tried very hard to become a Muslim and I did not find what I was looking for.   My alienation began when Muslims only became doctors for the money. This one is worth commenting upon because a whole array of shady business is derived from this ambition. Muslims basically want all the “western” economic status—they don’t want to be like NIGGERS. That is the driving force of this need to be rich—I would argue it is a general racism towards poor people and especially black people. But Muslims still want the cultural and religious standards. This is one of the reasons many Muslim kids do not buy into Islam because they see the hypocracy all the time--in the Masjid drive way, in the gossip of their mothers, etc etc.   I can honestly say mainstream Islam is used to prop up the neo-liberal policies of the United States Government. Sure I know of some radical Muslims who have dared to live Islam; I am curious to see what their outcome will be.   with respect thanks for your contribution Shariq!
