That was great fun. yesterday was spent in a meth addict style scrub o my kitchen and domestic happiness. I cooked a goose. Really.  A friend of Mum hunts and gave Mum and Jan a couple o wild geese, which they didn't want so i had them in my freezer and so yesterday i roasted it in the oven, in my Romertopf stuffed with chopped apples and onions and on a bed of the same, and doused with a little bit of vermouth (Noilly Prat of course)  It was super tasty, and leftovers are for tonight. The geese are very small, cooked they look like a slightly above avarage cornish game hen. In general i am avoiding meat, but i justified this as it was avoiding wast, it was wild and therefore somehow better then domesticated, and besides, i just like game. Today was the first day o summer class, should be an interesting six weeks. Let's hope i make it through. I think i will.
