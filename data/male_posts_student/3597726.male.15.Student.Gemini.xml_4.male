She's been having trouble with her back for about a year now, and tonight, its much, much worse. Just got off the phone with her Dad, Mr. Dave Essig and he says its really bad right now. So bad that she may not be mowing anymore...at all. There's even an outside chance that she'll be having surgery. If you are reading this, I beg you to pray for Katie. She deserves so, so much. She's the coolest person alive. The moment you meet her, you'll be dying to be her friend. Please, please, please keep her in your prayers. There's no way you can ignore this. SHE DESERVES MORE THAN A PRAYER OR A MUTTERED 'GET WELL.' SHE DESERVES A HAPPY, ENJOYABLE LIFE. AND NO ONES GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY. SHE HAS CHRIST.  Again, I beg you to pray for her whenever you are called to do so. shut down the moniter and pray for her right now. please. it would mean the world to me...
