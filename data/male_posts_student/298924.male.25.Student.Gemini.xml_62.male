I got slaughtered on my subject board but I guess we all take a beating sometime in life (Goodfellas indirect quote....the girls of 1208 know nothing about that....)  I have gone out in style each and everynight since....getting enough dank and drank to last me into the MMII (2002 for the slow heads....)  Got the sweet Jerry Rice (black) and Charles Woodson (Silver) jerseys....No OJ I'm not a Raider's convert though....  Anyway I had big plans for what was to be posted tonight and then I got some more alcohol in my system and this is the result...  See ya when I'm sober....
