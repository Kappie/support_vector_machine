Later on Sato's engine would gush out a blinding thicket of smoke causing David Coultard to crash and forcing him out the race. The safety car has already been deployed several times for other incidents. All of this occured within the first thirty laps and left only fourteen racers. Later Michael Schumacher would move into third and begin to build pressure on the Renault drivers. As I type this second place Alonso has had crashed and is now out of the race in addition to Michael Schumacher! Both had unrelated crash incidents inside the tunnel, both within four laps apart of eachother and the drama continues to unfold!
