Never was my thought just yesterday, infact on the way to school in the car i was not too nervous, not even having given it a thought.  It was still not scary when it started and you went. But just after Lim Qian Yu went, i started to freak! So here i am talking with Shu Ming and suddenly it's her turn! now i am all alone, But Mr.Wongs walks in and of cause her turn is delayed, then jokingly we say now there going to want break, guess what Jaspreet gets out to get a drink...!  Ok, so now it's Shu Mings turn since Jaspreet is back, but it a turn of surprises they call me in instead, there i was laughing away now to be called in! What a shock with a grin and a good luck from Shu Ming i was now it a darkened room sitting in front of the three heads.  After a considerable preganant silience, What is your vision for the council? The next few minutes were ok, they passed much faster in this side of the room, who would you choose to be your vice president?  You know my answwer, Shu ming for her talent of bringing things through (summarised) And u for "pour cette petite chose"  Let me tell you, i do not know why but i feel you are the right person to be the president and i am behind you all the way. Do not look back and pursue what you believe in. There is no concrete reason, but we quite all know it is to be you, you were meant for it, make sure you do not make any stops in between and when you  get it do not compromise anything for it, succeed and don't do anything you would regret.  Good luck. And changing is possible expression what would make you like divinity. Forever i would have you in ym heart but chase on.
