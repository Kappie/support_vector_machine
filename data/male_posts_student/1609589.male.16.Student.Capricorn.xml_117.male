We all had our laughs, some friends and i made fun of them by posting "If you love the devil, copy this and paste this into your profile." and "If you worship the holy goddess of pants, copy and paste this into your profile." it was no big deal, just a joke. But i saw something just now that made it so stupid, that it deserved an entry in here.  It seems someone has "adapted" the "If you love jesus" sentence into non-english! Fucking incredible! Here's what it says now on a girl's profile i know.  "If you love Jesus Christ then show it by copying and pasting this sentence in2 ur PRO"  I honestly thought that the christians thought that English was "god's language," so by saying that they're basically saying the following:  "JESUS I TINK U R A FAGOT AND NEED 2 DYE!!!"  Am i right? they actually took the time to retard-ify the jesus christ sentence!  Okay, onto me next topic-  Yesterday kicked ass for me, and ya know why? Because i performed the drumbone at Malvina's coffeehouse! And i did audio.  The drumbone is still not finished, AND it fell apart halfway through(hehe),  we werent even playing the song, we were having a jam where they passed out shakers and stuff, and i had my drumbone brought up so i could participate. Everybody thought it was a tuba. It was so fun. It's really too bad that NOONE from church showed up! God, you coulda helped! It woulda been better.... Oh well, it still kicked ass.  I went to bed at midnight and woke up at 1, so yeah it was tiring.  I think someone took pictures but i seriously doubt i'm ever going to get them.  Oh well, thats all for now... time for some breakfast... i mean lunch... whatever.
