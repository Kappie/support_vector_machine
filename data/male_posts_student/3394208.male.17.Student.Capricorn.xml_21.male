I can knock off all your teeth Need medication for this soul  Am I so blind? whatever it is I cannot see Am I so kind? Read the warning label on the bottle please  What are your motives? They're pretty precise, planned carefully You're screwing around with my lack of judgement What's in this disease? That has got me fucked up to my knees You start me up with your own set of keys  Dementia got a rope around my neck Tight, too tight to breath You got me walking back and forth effortlessly The time has come Fot you to step out the door and leave This is just too much, just let me be
