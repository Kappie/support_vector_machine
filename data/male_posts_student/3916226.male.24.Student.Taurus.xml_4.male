So here i am ... hollering out from the depths of my aching heart .. the dungeons have opened the spirit that soars and sweeps thru the pungent stinking corridors of the pits of eteternal void that once was or perhaps never truly evolved just mutated into this self loathing animosity ...  the sheer pain of an infinite wasp stings... or if pain could be channelled into the core of the earths... if 6 billion labor pains were channeled to the core of the earth would it erupt... what if we included all the animals and birds and reptiles and all the creatures that are born and die.. If we could extract the pain the feel in their life and pour into the darkest deepest black hole ever to be ...would it maintain an equilibrium.. would all the negativity  and bad karma that has created a void be filled with good karma... or would a lingering cancerous growth emerge from a tiny speck of pain that was left behind...  This kettle of molten anguish is in which we're dipped and our skirmishes and blemishes are embedded with shrieking hollering inferno of pain ... Is it vailable for any of us to spend an eternity in this molten lava marsh pit of pain...  amazing how the human mind comprehends feelings unlike no other beast ..
