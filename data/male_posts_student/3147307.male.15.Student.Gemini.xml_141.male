Sometimes these things can be good things used in the wrong way or for the wrong thing. Such as church where many times I find myself looking forward to going just to talk to friends. Or youth group, where instead of a time to grow in my faith, friendships, and have a good fun time I make it a self-centered time to try to act cool in front of people (many times looking stupid) and to see how much I can do that really I shouldn't do. I also find time to get on the computer, blog, watch TV, and play sports, but many days I just "can't seem to find time" for a quiet time, prayer, etc. So as school is around the corner (a month away), I want to consider my ways and I think one thing I can do is to limit my computer time so that I can't "not have time" for a quiet time, and to prepare for things such as Bible Bowl, school, bike trip, etc. I will still blog and comment on others, but hopefully can hold my time to under 20 minutes a day unless working on something important. Maybe you could pray for me that I could be able to consider my ways and to re-think my priorities in life. And maybe when I rethink my prioroties and go with that for awhile I'll have more time to have fun and I will be able to enjoy it more
