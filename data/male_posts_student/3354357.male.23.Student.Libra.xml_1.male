Regardless, I wasn't gonna stay right behind a crappy driver, so I decide to go around it.  I'm driving around it and look... It wasnt a drunk person, it was a stupid girl doing her make up!!! I was like "I know how important it is to look good for Jonny's football game honey, but you gotta do that crap some place else."  Im thinking that they should count people that do make-up while they drive as just a serious of offence as a DUI.  What he heck it up with people.
