Monday, tuesday basically slack days. Stayed at home most of the time to laze around and force myself to study. As the house was under renovation had to go out for meals except breakfast. Studying progressing at a slow rate, i scared i cant finish my revision. Onli got about 9 days left....  Wednesday training got shifted to the afternoon which was totally unexpected, its like we were expecting it to be in the morning. ANywaz i studied in the morning, and in the afternoon went to yck mrt to meet jansen and his pals. Arrived there at about 130pm, hm his hair has changed, more funky, other than that he's as cheerful as ever.After a while met all of his friends, erm freedy,dex,jonathan,ted,rayson,alvin, james. Hm they were from diff jcs like srjc,ajc and yjc. So we proceeded to nyp to eat in their canteen, foodcourt was closed so we ate fast food. The food is cheaper than outside but tastes delicious. After that we went to the grassroot club to bowl. MAn my bowling really sucks, cannot make it. Rayson was the most pro reaching a score of about 120 pins. I got the lowest blehz.  After that we went to play table soccer, quite funny to play but expensive, cost about 50 cents for like 6 balls only..We then proceeded to the billards room where a few of us were playing billards. Me and those not playing just lazed around, later we acted like pple deprived of a childhood, by throwing balls across the table into the pockets to c who was the most accurate. Lolx had loads of fun doing childish stuff. Finally around 520, we left the way and went our seperate ways. I must day i had an enjoyable time with them, they're pretty cool and nice pple. A big THANK YOU to JanSen, enjoyed chatting and catching up with u. STay cool man
