I wish that I didn't have to go to school in 19 days 5. I hope that the reason nobody liked eigth grade at Academy is because they liked all the other grades better, not because it is absolutely evil, hard, and hell to go through 6. I wish that wishes came true as easily as you can find a bare spot of dirt in New Mexico
