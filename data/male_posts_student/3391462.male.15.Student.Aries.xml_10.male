But think of the goodness, you finish you finals you get a whole 3 months of joy and fun to deal with. Believe me you want that, the ability to sleep in when you want where you want and call friends anytime in the weekday and they can't say that they have homework. You get to catch up with you pals and talk about the future. Finals is like taking a big sponge and sucking all of the knowledge out of your brain then you squeeze it and all of that knowledge just flows onto the paper. As you may have heard I now have tons to look forward to because I MADE JAZZ BAND. Along within my other chums we can Jazz it out and hang out after concerts. Life is great!
