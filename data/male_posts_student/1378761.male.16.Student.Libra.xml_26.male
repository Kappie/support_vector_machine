So I pull into the post office to meet up with them again. I turned around the car to face them on my side (driver side). We talked for awhile then this car pulls up trying to come in. So I quickly backed up not knowing the door was all the way shut and it caught in the bush. Well the buch caught my door and bent it around. So the door bent way out, bending the hinges and the front pannel of the car. So the door would not shut. So now I am stuck without a car to drive. What a bummer!!!  Im tired. Im pissed. Im out.
