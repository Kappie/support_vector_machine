This is especially so for the less positive, less pleasant and well, cruder remarks. Not that I’ve failed to notice over my past three years at Anderson but what Mr. Ang mentioned just recently made me sit up and wonder what really is their problem or our problem? In school, there are only two sorts of bright sparks – those at 3/7 and those at 3/1. Those in between are just  in – betweens . See, those at 3/7 are nice, respectable students who do their work and keep to themselves. Those at the other side of the rainbow however, are a darker shade of  black . They are bright no doubt and self – opinioned. They are the people PM Lee wants (don’t wait to be invited to tea instead take the…). Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for our brethren Dr. Chee Soon Juan. Ironically the situation is also the same at Anderson. However, the issue Mr. Ang raised was of similar nature. A secondary 2 student had been voicing his strong opinions on his online blog. Not that I am praising him but certainly there must be room for creativity and self – reflection? Of course, the nature and content of his online entries must be taken into consideration. To what extent was it crude and slanderous, which at the same time is very unbecoming of Andersonians. Certainly voicing out one’s feelings isn’t wrong or else esteemed writers like Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Brown would have been taken to task? However, cracking blue jokes and touching on controversial issues like what an extremely unwise Sheikh Haikel did would get you into unwanted trouble. As much as I wish to contend with the fact that airing one’s opinions is perfectly fine as long as one toes the line, it is disappointing to note that Mr. Ang also found usage of vulgarities and dialects of unprintable nature hard to swallow. I am one would enjoys the beauty of languages. The less refined bits are part and parcel of it not that it is encouraged but like the finer points of any language, it allows for better expression. I feel that instead of condemning these words and phrases alike, we must learn to accept them and realize that at times, it is that special word that bridges the gap. Of course, Mr. Ang’s cause for concern is understandable. Singaporeans are a refined lot like their British counter – parts where the f word is used without so much as a bat of the eyelid. Dialects are an art. They represent our forefather’s culture. Their way of life, which at that time was tough – going, and their manner of speech was likewise influenced. Many a time, I find it strange that people take pleasure in back – biting others. I do not stand for that. Instead, we must take pride in our words and actions. Others should not determine our lives; neither should someone else dictate our words and actions. We live in a society of freedom of speech where as far as I’m concerned is as fair as doing a “Chee”. I find it all contradictory – indeed there is allowance for freedom of speech but like the “Chee” incident, but like the governments stand on cults, it is fine as long as it does not put the country’s welfare/interest/… at risk. When I say taking pleasure in back – biting others, I am of course referring to Anderson’s latest case of defamatory remarks. Obviously, the culprit must have heard of Eric’s misdemeanors. The sad thing is, this guy hid behind a mask. By posting his comments online, he has placed fellow writer Eric and myself in bad light. Indeed we have committed offences of similar nature but we “claimed the credit” didn’t we? Though uncommon, his isn’t the first case that I’ve heard of. Its has happened on our level (sec 3) too but of course being kind and gracious and out of respect for the parties involved, I shall not give names. I feel that Mr. Ang’s take on student’s opinions is a little over the limit. Indeed, like the government, he has the school’s welfare at heart. But what about us – the student body? Has the school as a whole ever considered the plight we writers are in? We have no medium though which we can express ourselves, not online much less on paper. So, tell me please, where does that leave us? We are merely giving our 2 cents worth and also humoring our friends. Of course this shouldn’t be done at the expense of someone else say a teacher in this case. But certainly just some harmless comments about the teacher wouldn’t be in the red? Certainly, we will not make such statements without evidence but if there is cause and justification for it, why not? What the sec 2 boy did was definitely out of the question because from what I know, he made hurtful comments about teachers’ and classmates’ physical appearances. Obviously this greenhorn has lots to learn about being witty yet within limits or should I say lessons on maturity? I feel what he did was way under the belt. To discredit people is already putting one foot in the grave. To hide behind a mask, nailing the coffin. Perhaps, it is time for change, a revolution, and a better tomorrow as our beloved politicians love to proclaim with much enthusiasm though I believe it less and less each day. For starters, lets have a private online forum where only true – blue Anderson writers would be allowed. These might be a source of comfort for Mr. Ang because at the very least, our more meaningful remarks would be kept within ourselves. An interesting point to note is that every time such an incident crops up, Mr. Ang never fails to make mention of it but he only notifies us of the problem. What about his proposed solution? For three good years I’ve heard nothing but his ‘pressing issues’ even in sec 1 when I was none the wiser, he didn’t have any long – term solution. To spell it out simply, the school on its part is doing nothing than providing short – term solutions but in the long run, how effective would such a method be? From the way I see it, their methods are more of deterrence to would be  offenders  and nothing more. Such a tried and tested method would soon work off all its magic. At times, I really have this urge to grab my trusty pen and work my  magic  but my run – in with the school or more specifically Mr. Ang has  deterred  me. As you can see, all is not lost. The school’s tried and tested method still holds and hopefully so until I graduate. And when that time comes, I would say,” Au revoir Anderson! Never fret, it’s never too late to teach an  old dog  new tricks.”   Nofing is a sec 3 student would takes Mr. Ang’s opinions to heart ever since his run – in with him a long time ago and has been faithfully chronically the more meaningful happenings at Anderson.
