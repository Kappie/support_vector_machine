In the weeks to come, I'm pretty sure the things I need to do are gonna be up to my neck. (okay, exag konte) But anyway, not doing anything is not so fun either, put up against doing a whole lot. Nakakabato na dun sa dorm, so here I am, doing something "worthwhile".    I went to church yesterday morning, and we all had lunch together after the worship service.  Then I got back to the dorm around 3pm.  I took a quick shower, and proceeded right to what I really like doing when there's nothing else left to do - reading.  My roommate (who went home to Pampanga for the weekend) left a book she's been reading for the week - Danielle Steel's Kaleidoscope. And man, my sister is right, her books are depressing.  Nevertheless, I revelled reading them when I was in high school, and now that I'm at it again, Kaleidoscope isn't that bad either.  It was so depressing reading it at first, especially that I was listening to sad songs on my player.  Eventually, the story got more interesting and exciting, and "I couldn't put the book down" as some or almost everyone would like to say when describing a book they liked. I was reading from 5pm till 1am, and come to think of it, I didn't even have dinner.  I stopped reading after I finished three-fourths of the book.  I just finished all 395 pages of it this morning.  And I was like some fool, alone in our room, crying.. the story was so touching.. and I'm glad it had a "happy ending".. I practically cried with the characters.. I could almost feel their pain and afterwards, the relief.  (whoosh, drama!)  Really, it was all so dramatic.  Good thing all my roommates were out.  After reading I took a shower again, reviewed a little Math, wrote some notes on my journal about some things I read from my Bible.  Then I started to write in my "List Notebook".. it's where I list the things I want to do, places I want to go to, food/cuisines I want to try out, and a bulleted list of how I want some events in the future to be like. It's like a compiled list of the stuff I should be able to do as long as I'm alive.  And then I got tired of it all and went to this shop right beside my dorm to do this..check my mail and wait for some people online to chat with.  I'm both anxious and excited for this week, 'cause it's gonna be more real and well, more "nakaka-pressure".  Last week was spent basically getting to know our professors, and listing down the things we needed for each class.  This week is gonna be the real start..a lot of "unexpecteds" is gonna strike me mad, and man, I wanna go home just thinking about it.  I'd rather be in high school.  But this is my life now, and there's nothing I can do 'xcept handle everything with all the grace I can muster.  bshuks!
