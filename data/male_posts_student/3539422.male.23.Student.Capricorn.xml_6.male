Despite the fact that the US has spent twice as much as other donor nations combined (we have pledged $15 billion), world leaders, actors like Richard Gere and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan have stepped up the criticism.  They are accusing the United States of ignoring the plight of Aids victims while focusing too much attention on the war on terrorism.  Addressing the conference, Richard Gere said “There is a vicious terrorist out there and it’s not Osama bin Laden, it’s Aids.”  He went on to say that Aids is the most fundamental threat to our happiness and livelihood.  His comments are so absurd that they need no further elaboration.  Kofi Annan, in a veiled criticism of the United States implied that our enthusiasm in fighting the war against terrorism is disproportionate to our desire to fight Aids and suggested we could do more.  Convinced that the United States’ policy is driven by “neo-conservative” ideologues, few at the conference seem willing to even consider the effectiveness of an abstinence program.   urlLink    Protesters in Thailand Demonstrate Against Bush urlLink     The policy of President Bush has been to promote abstinence programs throughout the world, rather than relying solely on “safe-sex” and condoms.  Interestingly enough, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has supported the Bush policy, and as a result has become a target of criticism.  His country is a rare example of a success story in Africa, a continent ravaged by Aids.  By enforcing abstinence programs, his country has seen a drop in Aids infections.  Those supporting condoms as the only way to prevent Aids seem to think that abstinence is cruel and unusual punishment.  Asking people to wait until marriage before having sex is unrealistic, according to the critics of the Bush policy.  This reaction ought not be surprising. In our sex-absorbed culture, it seems inconceivable for some to even contemplate abstinence.  But the question must be asked; what is really going to solve the Aids problem?  The only way to ensure that Aids will not be transmitted is by not having sex and not taking drugs.  It seems so obvious, so why all the confusion?  As usual, the Left has a quick fix for a serious, deep seeded moral problem that they refuse to recognize. Their message is the equivalent of saying; “play with this loaded gun, just be safe”.  Refusing to address the root cause of the Aids epidemic, they look for simplistic solutions to a moral crisis.  Since their understanding of sex is not rooted within any moral context of procreation, love, family and responsibility, they cannot be expected to see the moral roots of the Aids crisis.  Abstinence programs, on the contrary, encourage a responsible and humane understanding of sex; that is, sex within the context of the married life is the only authentic purpose for human sexuality.  Abstinence attacks the root of the problem, addressing the moral implications of sexuality.  The source of the anger toward the president results from President Bush's refusal to use the bully pulpit as a spring board for the homosexual agenda.  While Bush certainly wants to find a cure for Aids, he will not use his office as a propaganda machine for the homosexual movement in this country.  I’m afraid that the criticism of the United States in Thailand is yet another example of the “blame America first” movement and has more to do with ideology that with fact.
