The DVD i made went down well though - Rob was impressed and whens to incorperate that in his list of services avaliable.  got home and felt really ill. i felt drunk even though i hadnt drunken anything. so i decided to go to bed and watch Lethal Weapon in bed. I feel asleep at 10pm lastnight...  woke up as 2am to some stupid fucking txt from "SMS.ac" i'm gonna remove my number from that - i have suspicions that they're charging me per txt i recieve too...so that'll stop pretty soon  I have no idea whats going on this week. i think i'm supposed to go the the cinema today - to see shrek 2 or sumthing - not too sure. I'm babysitting Chloe tomorrow...wednesday i think i'm going to the cinema with Rosy...thursday i've got the AS level results...and friday should be Disneyland woohoo!  but today....so not sure whats going on...i could go to brighton...i could stay here...i could......go see hannah or sarah..i could go shopping again...GRR no idea whats goin down. I might give simon a ring - see if he wants to go to the cinema.
