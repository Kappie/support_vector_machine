Today was pretty much like every other day I've had in these summer holidays.  Although I am dreading going back to school on Tuesday.  (Most Scottish schools go back on Tuesday because there summer holidays started before the ones in England.) Got up at about midday and started to play Splinter Cell on the Xbox.  That was one of the first games I got but probably one of the best.  Got part of my paper round done and then came on here.  I absolutely get ripped off for that paper round, lol.  I have to make up 185 papers by putting the leaflets in them as well and then have to go and do all the 185 houses.  I'm usually paid less than a fiver....but it is a free paper so I guess they couldn't really give me a lot for it could they?   Thats all for now folks!
