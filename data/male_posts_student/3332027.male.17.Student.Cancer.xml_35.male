I'm trapped in my own personal hell as I battle my feelings and my inner ambitions and let go of the past. I have had 2 substitutes teachers in a row. It's the Monday after the what started to be good, but I believed ended in a crappy way Memorial Day. I have to get my webcam back. Everyone in school today was in a crappy mood and Jasmin was sick as hell. She's having one of those flu with the cold and it was so so unpretty. Hope she feels better soon.  I look at my clock and it's 9:00 P.M Right now, I'm watching the series premeire of  Summerland . Not too bad.  Tomorrow I am making an appointment with my ex to get my webcam back. Hopefully I can get him to stay with me for a little while to talk or something. I just like being around him. I know he's got a cold, but hey that doesn't matter to me. Doesn't matter to me as in he's still the same person and I'd kiss him and other stuff since it's just a cold. I do care about his health; don't get me wrong. LOL he knows I'm crazy and hey sometimes its things like that, that keep people together. the craziness of one person. He puts a balance in my life. I'm going to call him in a few and then try to webcam with him.  Here's the log song. It's Avril Lavigne - Who Knows. It's just saying anything can happen and just be happy about today because something new will happen tomorrow. It's things in life like that, that keep us looking forward. We don't know what tomorrow will bring us, but hey, it's the anticipation that drives us.   "Yeah, yeah Yeah-eah, yeah Yeah-eah, yeah  Why do look so familiar I could swear that I have seen your face before  I think I like that you seem sincere I think I like to get to know you a little bit more  I think there's something more, life's worth living for Who knows what could happen.  Do what you do, just keep on laughing One thing's true, there's always a brand new day I'm gonna live today like it's my last day   Yeah, yeah,  Yeah-eah, yeah,  Yeah-eah, yeah  How do you always have an opinion And how do you always find the best way to compromise We don't need to have a reason We don't need anything We're just wasting time   I think there's something more, life's worth living for Who knows what could happen.  Do what you do, just keep on laughing One thing's true, there's always a brand new day  Who knows what could happen.  Do what you do, just keep on laughing One thing's true, there's always a brand new day I'm gonna live today like it's my last day   Find yourself, cause I can't find you Be yourself, who are you? Find yourself, cause I can't find you Be yourself, who are you?  Who knows what could happen.  Do what you do, just keep on laughing One thing's true, there's always a brand new day  So you go and make it happen Do your best just keep on laughing It's all on you, there's always a brand new day  Who knows what could happen.  Do what you do, just keep on laughing One thing's true, there's always a brand new day I'm gonna live today like it's my last day"   *ToDaY waS a SicK DaY*
