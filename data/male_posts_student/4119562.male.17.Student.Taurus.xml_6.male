I went to church, ate w/ my grandma for her birthday, and then to peytons church to wish him happy birthday. Then, after I got home, Laura called and said she was bored at the buiscuits game so i went and picked her up and then we went back to faulkner and sat on a swing and talked for an hour....It was awesome....and it felt really good. She and I are going to dinner and a movie friday night. I think she wants to see "little black book." It'll be good. All I have got to say is when life gives you lemons, eat them raw.....that was random.....I need to go to sleep
