Thanks to the viewer(s) and such sendin me happy bday emails.  That was cool.  What really rocked was Haunt....If you live in California, you MUST go.  Period.  You have to go, or I'll hunt you down and beat you with my caution tape.  Got about $116 for my bday, so now I have money for misc. things.  Yaay!  Anyways, I was up till 2am last night, haven't eaten much yet, so I'm gonna go.  Ta.
