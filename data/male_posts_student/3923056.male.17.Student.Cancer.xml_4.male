Lyrics(unknownSong) { I will dance, I will sing To be mad, for my King Nothing Lord, is hindering, This passion from soul!  I will dance, I will sing To be mad, for my King Nothing Lord, is hindering, This passion from my soul!  I'll become even more _undignified_ than this, I'll become even more _undignified_ than this  Some will say it's foolishness, But I'll become even more _undignified_ than this. }  well there you go folks. after hearing that @ Hillsongs, Rusty and I (Wes), have decided to call ourselves "undignitaries", as we are undignified in the eyes of the world for our Lord!  keep it up folks....catchya all laters....and no. not all posts will be this long.  :D  meanwhilst. signout: Wes [undignitary]
