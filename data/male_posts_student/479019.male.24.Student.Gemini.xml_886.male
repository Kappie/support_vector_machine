At least the 8 pages are only rough draft writing. I also have prepare 2 presentations for tomorrow.  I want to ramble a bit more about my life here and where I'm headed. Something that's really bothered me is how much I've been sucked into this culture of gossiping and talking shit here. The other day I heard a professor make the first negative comment I'd ever heard made about another professor. However, the comment was on how this other professor talks behind people's backs. To a certain extent it's not much of a criticism, because we all talk about people.  Personally I think there's a big difference between talking shit and voicing opinions. I used to be critical of people, but at the same time I do insert mentions of a person's good qualities. I might go on a rant about how so-and-so is a bitch, but be like there were times when she was cool. I've noticed I'm veering toward the whole talking shit thing. I'm going beyond being critical of people, and I'm just being an ass in how I present people.  What made me realize this is several recent conversations. One in particular is that I was telling a friend (#1) what another a friend (#2) said. Friend #1 said friend #2 seemed like an ass, and then I had to backtrack and bring up friend #2's good qualities. The irony is that when I've mentioned some of the things friend #1 has said and done, friends have said bad things about her too. Then I end up defending her too.  I don't think my defense of my friends takes away the guilt of presenting them in a negative light to begin with. It's one thing to be critical, which is natural... but it's another thing to convince other people that a friend is a bad person (even temporarily).  ***
