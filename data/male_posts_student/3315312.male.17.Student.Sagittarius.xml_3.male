I am excited something like this is finally underway. I hope to have periodic "columns" and point-counterpoint debates on various issues. I also hope comments from the blog's audience will not be scarce. Like Nathan said, all comments and opinions are welcome and will be respected. The first topic, the Iraq prison abuse, will be an interesting one. Stay tuned, check back tomorrow, and tell all your friends! ( Yes, both of them. ;) )  P.S. As always, fight the power!
