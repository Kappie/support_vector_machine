Listening to:  Dispatch - Flying Horses  Mrs. Gorke had a good quote the other day: "Life is what happens while you're planning something else."  And I came up with another short today  "How can you decide something is the most beautiful thing in the world if you haven't seen the whole world?"  But I am confused again, and I hate it when I'm confused.  And I'm not telling anyone why this is so, for part of the reason that I'm confused.  I don't think I ever said, but Amy  Nick broke up, but then they got back together again, that was like 3 days ago I think.  And there was a discussion about love one day here in the basement, and it inspired me to write this poem:    "Love Is" Love is Not a feeling. Of being it is, Not a state. Not an action, Or emotion, Or point of view. Love is merely A choice. - Thursday, February 5, 2004   What else to say? I'm doin stuff for my eagle ceremony.  I'm still deciding if i'm gonna invite other people besides my friends who helped with the eagle project.  I have to do homework today too.  I should probably go.  Later!
