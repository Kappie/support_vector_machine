So I had to take it off instead of seeing that little red thing on the corner when something's not loaded (you know what I'm talking about? Oh well!)  But forget that, something even scarier than that happened yesterday. Yesterday at 6:00pm my  cable went out so that means my internet connection goes, "Bye Bye!" Until Today at around 3:00pm! it came back so I'm happy now and immediately went to play some online 8-ball :h)  Well that's All I got to tell myself in case I ever forget what happened this day......wait......what!?
