But I am just too damned lazy to work hard in Academic. So therefore I am dropping Academic Math and taking the easy way out, Applied.....Thats right, I said it. Applied...I am not just descending from the Gifted Mountain into the depths of Academia (mmmmm Macademia nuts), But I am going deep into the hellishly easy pits of Appliedumb. Why? Like I said, I like Easy Street. Could I excel and do wonders in Academic Math? Hell yeah! But will I? Hell no...
