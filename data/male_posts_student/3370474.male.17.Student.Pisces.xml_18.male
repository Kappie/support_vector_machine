I may not have known you all person to person, but Tupac, trough your music I've been inspired to be more than what I am. You taught me to be a man, make a plan, listen to my voice. And taught me to listen to women, and give them a choice. Respect women, respect myself. You are my hero.  Soon, I will be joining you, I know it. I feel a knife puncturing my chest, and I'm having trouble breathing. I lay here crying every night, wondering why they took your life, when you were just hitting the top of your life.  We will never forget you, and I hope, when it is my time to go, they will not forget me.  Rest In Peace Tupac Rest In Peace Lisa Left Eye Rest In Peace To My Uncle Rest In Peace To Everyone Who Is Gone The Good Die Young
