I dont mean it has a knife and a short temper,  mean that I fell of my skateboard VERY painfully and now my arm wont move up or down. Now normally a stack on a skateboard wouldnt stop me for very long, but this one was special! We thought it would be fun to set the halfpipe on fire and try to skate it like that. Turns out metal dosen't catch alight very well, even with lighter fluid on the coping. so we gave up.  UNfortunutly, lighter fluid is EXTREMELY slippery and i stacked it so bad onto my arm its not even funny.and now it has swollen to twice the size.  bleh!!  Aside from that, things are peachy keen! England just won 3-0 against switzerland. Man, that was a good match! so good that it put me to sleep. after we scored the first goal, i nodded off...... to wake up and think we had won 2-0. i only saw rooney's lucky goal through a replay. Ah well, good on the team.  In other news, Sarah and Joe went to the zoo today, despite all warnings from local doctors. They were told prior to departing for colchester that animalitus was in the air that day, and it seems that they both caught it. They were seen leaving the animal sanctuary (sp?) looking more animal than man (or sarah). Joe had seemed to catch the Zebra version of the deadly virus, whilst Sarah walked out with the face of a lion. I'm sure i speak for everyone when i say "that'll learn ya, ya bastards"  Its also official, me and Paul have given up Chemistry for good. Holy crap it feels good, seeing the others go in while we just sit it out, doing the "were not going to chemisty but you are" dance. Its hard to explain the dance, but basically we are skanking, while swearing at the others! Its a classic.  Lastly, last night was fun. After fooking up my arm i walked home, to be met by paul. We then went knocking for everyone who's fun in CV. Martin came out, so did sam (albeit very briefly), ben g was at the gym(pronounced gyme)and Rach was at a play. everyone was boring and doing nothing so me and paul sat in Asda just talking about stuff. But the conversation always turned to girls... I cant say what was said, i'd have 2 kill you.... metaphorically of course...  ~~~Gossip!~~~ When i was walking home at 11pm ish, Rach was on her way to Larry boys! :@O and she was late to school the next morning....~~~/Gossip~~~  i think thats it, its certainly long enough... keep it safe Veg   .......Ive just been told that they do not have animalitus... it was facepaints...i apologise for any concern caused. :D
