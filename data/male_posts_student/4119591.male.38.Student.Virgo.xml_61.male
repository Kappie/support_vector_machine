Taken directly from the  urlLink transcript  of today's statement by GWB as he signed the latest defense appropriation bill into law: "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we." I think I understand what he was trying to say but... uh. Does he write his own material?
