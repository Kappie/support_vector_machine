Theres not much between a Liberal Sissy and Right Wing Nut Job according to the guys over at  urlLink www.jibjab.com . Either way, the Americans arent going to be pulling out of Iraq anytime soon, and in the consumerist mecca that we've come to know and hate you can be guaranteed that there'll be a lot more wars in the pursuit of money and oil.  Is it really true that the president of America is the most powerful man in the world? To what extent is Bush merely the corporations puppet, and to what extent are his political decisions influenced by big business. Let's not forget that Bush is a businessman foremost, and a president second.
