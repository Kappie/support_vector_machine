I feel like I am doing the things in life right, but the answer I get is not the one everyone else got.  What are you going to do?    Went running this morning, I felt like the kid with asthma that had to walk while everyone ran.  Where did he get that damn doctor's note?  I assume that to be successful in Medical School I will need to be in good shape as well.  Is all this responsibility worth it?  I just get tired of making more and more sacrifices and others seem to remain the same.  I guess this is growing up?  Sometimes I wonder where my place in the world is?  Who are my friends there?  Or is feeling misunderstood just part of life you have to tolerate?  I want change, but change is will only slow down my path to becoming what I want to do in life.  Where are Simon and Garfunkel now, and bob dylan, or Crosby, Stills, and Nash.  I want a reason to do nothing.    I have seen footage of a South Korean man being held in the hands of Al-Quaeda Rebels, they are probably going to behead him as they have already done with two American cities.  This world is becoming crazy, there has been violence before, but humanity has up and left the room.  Poor men that have nothing to do with the their cause, but have families.  Tragic???  still like that girl, but the magic 8 ball says outlook not so good.
