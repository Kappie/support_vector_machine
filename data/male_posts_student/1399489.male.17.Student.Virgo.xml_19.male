This school year has been really good when i look back on it.  my life changed soo much throught the year.  all my new friends and all my new experience.  when this year started i didnt have a whole lot of friends outside of st joe and i also didnt have much of a social life.  Jes was the biggest change that happened this year.  she changed so many things in my life for the better.  im glad we didnt end up not talking any more because that would have been a big loss for me, i would have lost one of the best people in the world.  i met so many new great ppl i dont know how i went on without them before i have such a good time with all yall casey, allison, kegan, MK, courtney.  then at st joe i even made lots of new friends. Erin, your one of my best friends now and ur always there for me.  im so glad we got to be good friends. haha we always have the same problems. then mark, tripp, katie, donovan, kathrine i love hangin out with yall. i dont wanna forget everybody that i was already friends with before this year too yall are all great (u probally know who u are).  but through it all bryndan has been there with me we both went through ups and downs and i dont think we could have done it without each other.  i want to say thanks to everybody for everything!  my life wouldnt be the same without any of u.
