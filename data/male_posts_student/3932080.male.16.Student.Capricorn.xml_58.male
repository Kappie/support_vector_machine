"Fish in the Water"    The movie was  Jack.  The premise portrayed an elementary-school boy (the anything but boyish  Robin Williams ) with an aging disorder that advanced him to a 40-something body type while still trying to meld with the mini-brat packers at his learning level, all the while learning reading, writing, and concealing the grade’s biggest hard-on from  Jennifer Lopez  (a well-updated  Mrs. Robinson ).  Scissors Sisters , if not scripted exactly the same, seem in the same boat; the ultra-glam five-pack matures into something too grown to balance animalism with  Junior Senior , but at the same time too adventurous to trade kiddie porn with  Gary Glitter . More of a hipster disorder than an aging disorder, they pioneer their own lifestyle as Jack does, although Jack’s pioneering is a fault of science, while the Sisters have nothing to blame but sexual energy. Actually, maybe it is science that joins a hodgepodge of homosexuals, potential transsexuals, and metrosexuals; but anyone who’s ever delved into suffix study can look above and see that it all relays back to sex.  This sexual power-something that the aforementioned  Junior Senior  never really had-crafts an album set musically in 1977 and mindfully in 1969; that free-love attitude masquerades as a gay-disco cover band rifling through 43 minutes of music that no one requests but everyone can shag to. Problems expected of that era arise; “Filthy/Gorgeous” (the best interpolation of the  Mario  bass theme yet) sees  Pretty Woman’s  “biggest moneymaker [go] flaccid,” while “Music is the Victim,” which breeds disco with blues like “Diamond Dogs” did with country, pitches vocalist  Jake Shears  as the  Jesus  who says “fuck the 10 commandments” in lieu of saving the music (now there’s an idea  VH1  hasn’t commercialized).  That framework for the album, while intriguing to every listener, is the handicap that will keep the  Sisters  from hitting big in the States. Radio stations dismiss the disc’s singles as quickly as the  FCC  dropped its sticker on the cover, all because flirtations with free and choice love underscore the entire album.  The music labels the band members quicker than they could label themselves, sacrificing identity for a good ride that should stay the hell out of the South-central America.   All that said, some brilliant pop songs surface here; “Take Your Mama” provides the one glimpse of mainstream, as island guitars mesh with  Elton -esque pianism to find a chorus that reinvents  Ben Stiller’s   Starsky and Hutch  “Do it” as a full-frontal command of high-pitch. “Comfortably Numb,” the sometimes-awkward, sometimes-pleasing  Pink Floyd  cover, may as well be a tribute to the late  Maurice Gibb . Best is “It Can’t Come Quickly Enough,” which starts as a lurking, echoed,  Amnesiac -meets- Roxy Music  pastiche, and soon becomes a darker rewrite of  Björk’s  “Hyper-Ballad” that could have been penned by  Placebo  if they took themselves seriously. Reversing that logic is “Mary,” another beautiful piece that sounds like an outtake from “Sea Change,” only if  Beck  was in a little lighter mood.  Running that gamut of musical textures and tempers works dazzling effects for  Scissor Sisters , and the genre-copping elements here and there further their artistic achievement. The sly prog saxophone that highlights the closing of “Laura,” the picketing-gone-audible feel of “Tits on the Radio,” and the toy-like mutations throughout “Lovers in the Backseat” (my first thought: The  Rugrats  Theme) all side-dish this wonderful entrée. On “Better Luck,”  Shears  sees himself a “fish swimming without fins.” Also called “sinking,” that proclamation denies all fish-out-of-water presumptions by showing that  Scissor Sisters  are so stuck in their mascara-lined environment that they can’t ever leave. Unless, of course, they get hooked, which is extremely unlikely; they’ve already hooked you.
