It's hypocritical I know but I just want to kill those people.  Like in my Business Class theres this group of people who just sit there and yell and talk and they have all these meaningless conversations about who they "go wit" and all they do is just yell across the room and don't even make complete sentences.  Stupid dumbfucks. they piss me off so unbelievably much it is uncomprehendable.  There's this new gay one and he is so fucking homosexual it amkes me mad, not that I'm a homophobe but his voice just annoys the fuck out of me.  He has this lisp and he thinks he's the shit so I want to kill him. I could go more in depth on my BM class but I don't feel like it.
