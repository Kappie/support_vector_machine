They took a shit in the sink of the Cooper Hall public bathroom, clogged and overflowed the toilet, discharged a 10 lb. chemical fire extinguisher, and stole an exit sign. $150 in damage according to the flyers posted near the building entrance. The whole fire extinguisher thing is understandable (it happens alot), but who shits in a fucking sink? Yeesh.....whoever did it must have been REALLY pissed or REALLY drunk. I pity our building janitor who probably had to clean all the shit out of the sink.  -BIGsmut.
