Later Tiana, Aly, their friend Kelly, and of course Tiana's mom came and picked me up. We ran around to winco, burger king...the same places i was at this morning..then they dropped me off...which i thought was kinda lame but okay...whatever.  I also tried to make pictures out of letters. it's hard.
