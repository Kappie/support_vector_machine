    
       
      The lights in the distance Flicker in the eternal night Guided by the clicking Of my weary soles  Hit me suddenly It did  What is this warm feelin?  A foothold And a hand Reach out of the darkness  The sprawling tree Now radiant Basking in the lunar tides  Jagged rays Ground Solid to soft  Two figures remain as one
