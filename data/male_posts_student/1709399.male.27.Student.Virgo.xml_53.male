Why do they have a Village deep inside the Sanctuary ?   2. Why do they allow two wheelers/ four wheelers ( What protection do human beings have against animals   vice versa it becomes easier for poachers to get inside ) inside the Sanctuary ?   3. There is no signboard saying "No Honking"and the external vehicles disturb the animals by honking  shouting inside .                                           If the Govt is serious about Wildlife Conservation then let it act before its too late .
