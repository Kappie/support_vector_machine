What are the characterstics of such a person?   Let me clarify right in the beginning that JEE is  not  something that can be counted as a common  characterstic . On similar lines, living in IIT and such superficial things are out.  What I am really interested is, in finding out whether there is a concept of  Typical IITian , to which a large majority of IITians would confirm?  Personally, I find it hard to define such a thing because we IITians can be quite a difficult study.   On one hand, you have strong individualistic guys and on the other hand, there are the herd mentality guys. If that was not complicated enough, the very same people who tend to follow the herd in some aspects would turn out to be extremely individualistic in some other traits.  That was just an example. But its true for quite a lot of traits that one might be interested in looking for.  So ultimately, I find it hard to define a  Typical IITian . But a lot of people apply that description to a lot of IITians.  Throw some light people!
