And after thinking and thinking about it, I got to the conclusion that it makes me feel better. I pour all my emotions and thoughts and I leave with a clean soul, in a way I sweep all my fears and reaffirm all the good things that happen to me.  Clear example was the post almost a week ago. I was feeling down and not knowing why... I got describing everything I felt and suddendly at the end of the post I realized I was being jealous... and that made me feel blue, sad and melancholy. Then as I was writing and thinking about it, I felt great, clean and sad-free.  That's why I write in this blog, not because I want everyone to know what I do, whom am I seeing, whom is making me ache for him, or, why does it feel so sad and great at the same time... Is just my way of saying what I can not sound. Is letting my feelings out without making me feel uncomfortable. Is letting everyone I care for know why do I care and how much I care for them, specially him.   ... Yesterday I did something that still scares me. Is not that I regret it, is not that I didn't enjoy it. Is what it could mean, what could it make us feel, and what direction might it takes us. My fears got kinda mixed today and my senses got all wrapped in a box. I'm kind of numb. I just don't feel. Not as I felt yesterday all morning and afternoon. I barely got a glimpse of a call today. Not by my part, not by his part.   Sometimes I feel I'm not giving all he expects and sometimes I feel I'm not giving all he deserves. At the end, yesterday was like a great meal: great appetizers, good soup, excellent dinner and a sweet dessert, but next day you feel bloated and gassy and in need of an alka seltzer. I feel, like, like I was given a line from a great guy and I fell for it. Is something I know I shouldn't feel, and it makes me look stupid, but, is the reaction I have. And I'm sorry for it. But ok, is 12.03 am and I can't help feeling this way.  I'm obsessive, childish, compulsive, a handful of jealousy, insecurity, etcetera. What the fuck can I do? Or is it that I'm just too cynical and dark?
