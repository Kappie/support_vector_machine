I was reminded yesterday of one of my lesser moments...even though I remember many great moments of my idiocy, living them out in the solitude of my own room and showing no one my weakness, the death rattle comes when someone reminds you that they suffered from your actions.   ...  She only asked for one thing, for me to be on time.  "You'll be here at 5:30?" she said, holding my hands, eyes fixed straight at mine.  Her eyes were my favorite part of her...large, bold, soulful; the kind my mind would shed layers and swim in.  A word was a word, a touch a touch, but her eyes covered all.    This meant she couldn't lie.  "Are you mad?" I would ask her, in the spirit of redundant banter inspired from fear of truth.  "No," she'd say, directing her falsity at me, playing her part in the same game.  I'd ask again.  Same answer.  Never did I trust the honest look consciously, because truth was always described to me in ways of oral language that often contradicted body carriage and physical intangibles.  But I always knew.  And it always upset me.  Truth was Truth and Lies were Lies, and even though I often lied to myself or lied to protect myself or lied to protect others, I had no patience for those who committed the same transgressions.  The repressed energy and misunderstood hormones of adolescence were a similar hurdle; I interpreted her actions from a purely selfish point of view, constantly blaming myself and creating a distemper of distrust.    But when I would show up at marching band practice, or we would pass each other in the hall, or she would open the door to find me on her porch with some random bric-a-brac in hand, everything sped up after the first look.  I breathed faster, moved quicker, thought more, smiled brighter.  Her gaze was an energizer, a constant emotional enhancer, a reminder that she saw something special in me.  I could tatto  Whipped  on my forehead and parade around the high school, flashing a lovestruck grin and expressing my undying admiration and feelings for her, but it couldn't match her look.  The only time the look would sour was when I asked her to verbally express her feelings for me, stemming from a personal lack of understanding the feelings of others, and the need for positive reinforcement on my own terms.  That would turn the energizing look into a purgatory look, which often resulted in my questioning her attitude of the moment, and led into the looks of lies.    I squeezed her hand.  "Of course," I smiled.  Maybe I kissed her, rubbed her shoulders, ran my fingers down her back, held her close and led her head onto my shoulder.  Or maybe we just looked at each other.   "Are you sure?"  she said.  "Of course!  If I want to get up for something, I'll get up for it."  She knew that I had trouble waking up.  Throughout my whole life, nothing has caused me more strife than an inability to wake up in the morning.  At the beginning of a term, or a job, or a schedule that requires a timed rise, I will get up on time, get ready at a lacadasical pace, and make it to my destination.  But after one or two weeks, I would start to sleep longer, soon so long that it affected my arrival at any destination.  I could set two alarms.  Three.  Once I set four, in each corner of the room.  But a need for sleep would take over, and I would turn the alarms off and return to bed.  Charm and work ethic made up for my tardiness on all fronts.    This is still a problem.  In college, my GPA for classes 10 am and after was 4.0.  Classes before 10 am, I had a 2.9.  At the library, I would show up later and later, until for the last month I didn't get to my 8:30 start time until 9:30 or 10 usually.  I used to shower at night in case I slept through the alarm, but I thought if I didn't shower I would have to get up on time.  Instead, I sometimes sleep and go to wherever stank and nasty, loathing.    She knew I was going to sleep through, even if she didn't want to believe it. I thought I would get up.  I wanted to get up.  I set two alarms.  I don't remember them going off.  I remember getting up at 6:00, cursing as I violently got my fishing gear together and threw on my clothes.  Maybe she was still asleep, I thought.  I wanted to call and explain, but I didn't want to wake the family.  It didn't matter...the phone rang as I was leaving.    I arrived at 6:25, wearing the facade smile, hyped up on unreal energy, trying to hide the pain and hurt and sadness for letting her down.  I pulled the Volvo up, jumped out of the car, and jogged up to the porch, smiling.  She was sitting on the swing bench, stoic.  She looked up at me.  I looked away.  I didn't want the truth. ...  I don't come here often at all.  And I spent a lot of time and energy in this community.  The nostalgia isn't a longing for the past, wishing that things were different.  It's a vault of old memories I didn't have access to.
