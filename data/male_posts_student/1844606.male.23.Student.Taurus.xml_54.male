Without seeing prices, I somehow managed to pick out the most expensive items on each page, thinking I'd look good in them.  But then I realized, its rediculous to have a sweater that costs $275 when my coat was less than half of that.  So I'll continue to wear white undershirts, and ill fitting jean jacket (compliments of someone who didn't know how that whole "Lost and Found" bin worked at LFHS) and wear my one pair of good jeans until someone decides that I need a makeover-on their dime.
