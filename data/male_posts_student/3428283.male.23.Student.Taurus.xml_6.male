Seriously, the woman doesn't deserve it. Give her a fine, give her probation, but what she did doesn't deserve prison time. She wasn't trying to screw anyone or anything. She wasn't even grossly negligent. She made a mistake by taking some really bad advice. All she needs is a slap on the wrists and a "don't do that again." The justice department is getting quite out of hand with trying to scare people and find justice. I doubt anyone in that organization has any idea what "justice" really is.
