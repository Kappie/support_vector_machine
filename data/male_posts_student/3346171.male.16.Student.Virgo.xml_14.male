The movie was " Van Helsing", WOW, what a good movie, it's a movie about a good who has no family and he's  protected by Rome ( in 19th century ), and the church asks him to plead for a girl who all the family died. He has to kill Dracula and his fianceés ( i don't know if it's fiacé or fianceé, who is the female? ), and also a wolfman, this wolfman was the girl's brother, and dracula has to find Frankstein, because he is the key of the sourse of dracula's baby ( such a moving story, isn't it?!!!). I recomend this movie. Something shocked me at the mall. My bro's working and i didn't have anymoney to buy something for eating, and he payed all for me, WOWOWOWOW, that never happenedm and will never happen again :):(:[:{  Getting in school, who i see? Writing teacher - on the week test, she thought she had saw me "asking for help" ot a friend [ she's crazy], and she took my test from me- and i was kinda mad at her, the test was soooooo easy, and i knew all the aswers. That Bit***! If i get 0, i'll kill her. Gee, i'm getting dangerous!?!  Dangerous, no yo no soy peligroso, but i'm getting lazy and lazier, i'm skipping all the P.E. classes. What can i do if the teacher doesn't care if we - about 15 poeple- go home or not?  I read something today that made me think, it was: *don't wait for a shoulder, to start cring *don't say "I love you" , and then make Sb cry( this is the one who made me think) *don't wait for the hungry to come, and then start cooking *don't wait the chance comes, grab it firstly and others.  Did i mentioned that my uncle from Italy said to my dad tha very very very soon i'll live with him? Well, i think it isn't true, but if it's i'll love. I'll start in the italian class next august.   I'm sad this last couple days, a realized somethings that i can't tell :{. No need for worries folks, i'll be FINE AS WELL_
