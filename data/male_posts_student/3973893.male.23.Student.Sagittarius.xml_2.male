Well, now my car needs a tune-up (makes sense, seeing as how I've never gotten one of those) and the oil pan gasket needs replacing since that was where my major oil leak was from. All this, including the work already done, is going to set me back a total of, are you ready,  $1,020 .    Wow, it must have been karma, because if this would have happened any other time I wouldn't be able to afford this. Guess I can kiss all new furniture good-bye until next month.
