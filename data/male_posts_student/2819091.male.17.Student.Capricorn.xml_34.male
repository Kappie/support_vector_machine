       
       NOTHING MORE   I have nothing more to give...  Nothing more to say. Nothing more to hear.  Nothing more to do.  I am nothing, don't you see?   Without you, I don't have a life.  Without you, I don't have a muse.  Without you, I don't have anything worth living for.  Without you, I am dead.  My life is based around you. My life is everything when it comes to you. My life is worth fulfilling with you. My life is you.
