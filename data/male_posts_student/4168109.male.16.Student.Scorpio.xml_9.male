The magazine was London's  Time Out  magazine, and on the cover was the illustrious  urlLink Natalie Portman . Unfortunately for me, I already had three books stuffed in my pants, so the magazine wouldn't fit. But the offer was too good to pass up--I bought it. I spent seven dollars on a  magazine  from  London  because it had a three-page article about Miss Natalie.  Seven dollars!  But it was worth it, because she looked [ urlLink ! ] and sounded positively radiant. Here is a portion of the article expertly reproduced by me:       ...Mike Nichols' film  Closer  in which Portman...portrays a character she's never played before--a stripper. 'You definitely see more of me than you have before,' she laughs. To prepare for the role, Portman learnt how to hoist her slight, girlish frame for the libidinous delight of others--by pole dancing...rating herself as 'pretty good for someone who's not a professional.'...She has been known to be...fiercely guarded over the way her body is portrayed on screen. It makes her decision to play such a titillating character that much more noteworthy. 'I never want to do anything that's going to make me uncomfortable in my regular life,' Portman explains. 'I never really want to walk down the street wondering who's seen my tits.'...Now, however, Portman is enjoying the free time she has planned for the rest of the summer. She'll spend it helping encourage American voters to vote for John Kerry.       Pole-dancing Kerry-supporter--if that's not the most attractive combo on God's       urlLink G-D  [ urlLink blog ] : HEY!      G-d's green earth I will eat my hat.      There's also a pretty great quote from one of my heroes,  urlLink David Cross , in the magazine: "I'm genuinely puzzled as to why [Tony Blair] wants so desperately to impress this lunatic Texan Christian fundamentalist."      In other news, the  urlLink mystery  continues...         -chuck-   ...or eat limes...
