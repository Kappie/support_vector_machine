In entertainment news, Billy Joel recently crashed his car... again.  Billy Joel has now decided to start writing books for kids.  Instead of titles like The Cat in the Hat, he will be writing The Car in the Living Room. ... In world news, President Bush fell off his bicycle near his ranch in Texas last week.  Lucky for him, he was wearing the helmet he usually uses when eating pretzels! Donald Rumsfeld visited the troops in Iraq a while back, upon arrival, he said "Please, no pictures." =P ... And finally, Calgary and Tampa Bay suit up for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs tonight at the Saddledome. Go Flames!  CK out!
