The support acts were worthwhile, Wolfman and the Irish woman who played with Pete were fantastic, and Pete trounced the performance which he put on last time around, which frankly was an overhyped, under-ticketed bubble-bursting. The highlights were the ridiculously energetic and totaly-fucking-amazing "Wolfman", the haunting "For Lovers", anthemic "What a waster" (basically epitomises everything the Libertines, Babyshambles and Pete Doherty is all about) and "I'm in love with a feeling". NB, if anyone wants to correct me on the title of the latter, please do as I'm not assured that taht is its title. I arduously wish that Pete would "exorcise his inner demons" (his words, not mine), get clean and reattach himself to the Libertines, who are surely the most exciting and tempestuous band since Jack White first laid his paws on Jason Stollsteimers gullet. Best of luck with whatever line of rehab you take, Pete, for as my co-Libertines fan Steve said to me on Tuesday morning, I don't think any bona fide Libs liker wants the Nirvana-esque hyperbole which has exponentiated around Kurt Cobain's coffin to blossom around Pete's coffin, as it assuredly will as soon as he gets his perversely unglamorous deathwish which he appears to will upon himself. Let's hope that his words "I don't take enough drugs to kill me" resonate true.  Anyway, enough of that. I'm currently working on a song called 'The Priest', to add to the ranks of 'Let's burn money', 'Where are you', 'Sickly on Love Pts 1 and 2', "I am a scelestious man", 'Walking with angels' (formerly titled inspiration), and various other stuff which I have written and am currently purporting to make coherent and good. I'd like to have an album or twos worth of material written and demoed before we even start doing gigs, I want to take this whole thing methodically and rationally and thus lower the risk of failure. I've kinda binned the idea of a song called "The Village Idiot", may return to it at a later date and totally rewrite it. I wanna sound like a cross between Black Sabbath, Radiohead, sort of art-prog rock/metal. "The Priest" is indubitably punky I can't classify it in any other way, but believe me this is formulated, premeditated and a concerted attack on the establishment, John Lydon style. Cut the nonsensical trash, this is not formulaic modern punk, I think I've got it down to the essence of what punk is and what punk should be, and I have bolstered the power and lyrical venom with a quite unconventional song structure. Anyhoodles I want a trendy businesswoman girlfriend. Actually no, wait I don't but I'd like a girlfriend. Being an introverted, articulate (though I say so myself) Radiohead fan with a floppy fringe, floppy stomach and a Commie beret hardly helps matters, does it now?  Mood: Effusive! Music: The White Stripes - Black Math; Black Sabbath - Sleeping Village; The Velvet Underground - Femme Fatale; Babyshambles (feat. Wolfman?) - Wolfman.
