It took a long time, so my friends, if you want to change it back to the boring-ass format we had before, you can do that, weâ€™re all administrators here. You can conquer the blog, like Charlemenge, but you better be prepared to fix the links aftwerwards and that takes frigging forever!    You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.
