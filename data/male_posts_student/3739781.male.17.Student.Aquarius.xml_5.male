I'm making this post for all of my friends so you better take it to heart, otherwise I'll beat the crap out of you before I leave :D..........Anyway  The other night I was coming home from walmart with 3 of my friends and we were listening to music, making complete asses of ourselves. I thought it was great. This was one of the first times I have ever not been the driver with my friends and I noticed one thing when I was sitting in the back. My friends are the greatest friends in the world. I love them all. I'm going to miss them more than anything when I'm in Thailand. It was the strangest feeling ever, and yet one of the greatest. Seeing everyone with a giant smile and hearing the same words "Hope it dangles on a string.....I am vindicated, I am selfish I am wrong, I am right"(Dashboard-Vindicated)but at that moment everything seemed to go into slow motion, and pulled me into a depression of sadness....Like what I have just started experience just hear in the last few seconds of writing this post. But it made me really really happy at the same time, to know my friends are there, and they always will be.  Thanks everyone, as this tear runs down my cheek. I'll miss all of you, and I will be back, I swear to that. I love you all more than the world.......  ~Jonathan
