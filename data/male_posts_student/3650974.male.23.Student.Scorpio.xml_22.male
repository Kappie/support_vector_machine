I've been on a buying spree lately, snapping up quite a bit of merchandise from various favorite movies and television shows, not to mention purchasing a realization of a mathematical joke for a friend's birthday. Don't ask. I must be feeling wealthy, because I really don't need any of this shit. Though, I think it comes with aging, the wish to crystallize certain memories in a physical form. A talisman to recall the things we know we're going to forget.    It was suggested to me today that I shouldn't be friends with a certain someone simply because we happen to disagree on nearly every political and social topic imaginable. What nonsense. Those are the people I  most  need to be friends with, because that's how opinions are changed and compromises forged.The only way for this country tobecome a lost cause is if we start to believe that we have nothing in common with those who see the world differently. I firmly believe that I've changed a lot of people's minds simply by being honest and open about who I am, what I am, and what I think is right.    Nor am I the only one. It ismy great hope for my generation that we will improve the world simply by havingclearer visions of one another.   Unrelatedly, I was called today on my bad habit of asking difficult philosophical questions of my friends that I haven't thoughtthrough myself. In the interest of spreading the love: do you want to have children someday? Why or why not?
