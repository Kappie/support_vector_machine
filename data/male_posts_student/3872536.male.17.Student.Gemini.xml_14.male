Long time nv play le. Can't balme lah... Quite rush when playing coz 2.30 enter and 4.00 leave as the charges after 4 is more ex lol.  Felt rather extra being with them today lor. COz they r toking about stuff i duno or rather not realli interested lor. So felt rather left out lah. But nevermind used to it liaoz.......    Finally bought her present liao. A burden off my head lol.  Then when I'm on the bus choon teck, pei yu they all then tell mi they at tamp complex playing bad lol. Never ask mi along... Haiz. She's asking mi whether wana go watch harry potter tml. Initially I rejected coz expensive but agreed in the end coz it's been a long time since I last went out with them lol. So it's onli nice if i spare some time with them lol. My parents actually wanted mi to go new house with them de lol. But I think nvm lah hehe.  Felt quite sick today lah. Slept for 2 hours when i reach home lor and I was like so restless when playing pool today lol.  Tml still muz deal with the EM3 kids from Qiao Nan. Rather challenging haha.
