Someone once said to me, "Explain Ryan" (Person). I said, "inbreeding." Clearly I am better than him, because I steal witty quotes from Buffy. He does not. Or at least he tries but he cannot beat me because I am geekier than he.    Ryan also is dumb because he is gay. He does not know where my gay froggy hat is. But now he does. So I am cool. Cooler than him you might say. Esteemed Swedish professor Frederick Floofel says his exciting expository  A Brief History of Ryan and His Floofocity , "Ryan is a floofel" (Floofel 3133).    In conclusion, I conclude, that Ryan is ultimately and conclusively, a concluded buttmonkey.  Works Cited  Floofel, Frederick.  A Brief History of Ryan and His Floofocity . Prague    Press.
