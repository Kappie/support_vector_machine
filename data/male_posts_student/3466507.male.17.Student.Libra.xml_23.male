Well, what do I have to say about this? Sometimes I am just so bored I simply find people to chat with. Hey, it's a mere coincidence that some of them happen to be so much younger than me, ok? It's not like I purposely select younger girls, although I admit that I prefer to chat to girls. I don't have much to talk to guys(thinking of it, I don't have much to speak about to girls either).  So, read this and get involved with me at your own risk. You are warned... haha!
