We didn't do anything in which I participated, except very sparsely... WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR SOME PEOPLE COUGHSTEPHANIEKAPLANCOUGH oh wait she did do stuff, but not in the room; Hilana then.  Matt Zimmer and I spent like fifteen minutes running around the school looking for working vending machines with good drinks in stock that would accept money, we ended up settling for Hawaiian punch, which is pretty good, although John says that Ben Fong's parents forbade him from drinking that because it's racist.  Today was my last French before I leave, it was pretty good.  I was writing stuff in big letters on my paper and then holding it up so I could communicate with Ian (across the room).  Mme DeRobert never even noticed.  Melody doesn't always know when things should not be said.  Tomorrow, I plan to shoot a lot of video for my French movie, about like leaving Newton.  Stay tuned, I'm planning to interview six students not counting me or George.  Read on for a survey, stolen from Loren but also from Melody and whoever Margaret is (Melody's Lesbian lover... whoa, the first time I typed this I accidentally wrote "mother").
