I can enjoy myself in school much more than usual.   After school today there was a lot of fishheads in the TV Prod. room while I was working on my english project. It was weird being the only Advanced kid in there, when it used to be only me and Hobie in there and all the rest were Advanced kids.    So there is this kid at school that most people don't like. They dislike him because he is very condescending to most people, and they revile him because they perceive him as smarter than them. But he usually does act like he is better than everyone else. I guess the reason I did like him before was because he was smarter than most people. But now certain actions that he has taken have shown me that he is really is the same as the rest of us. Maybe a little unscrupulous, but who isn't? Every day he goes to school he loses because he doesn't expect to learn anything, because he already knows more than everyone. This is a very regressive thing for an intellectual. Instead of saying, "I know everything," say, "I know nothing." An eagerness to learn would help him much more in his endeavors, especially in something that he desperately wants. But who am I to meddle?   Tomorrow I think I am going to talk about my favorite CD.
