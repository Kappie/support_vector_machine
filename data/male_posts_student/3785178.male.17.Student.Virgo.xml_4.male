Because if you have a shit computer, like I do, and it freezes when you are in the middle of a very long entry...YOURE FUCKED! Cause then you lose everything you just said! GRRRR! Well, I guess I'll just sum up everything I said before...basically I was saying how Friday nights suck because usually I have to work. And then I went on into how I get confused with my thoughts. Mostly due to the on going struggle between good and evil inside my head. I guess it wasnt all that much...but it seemed like a lot since I went into such deep detail. Fuck it, thats enough for right now. Maybe I will write later...till next time.
