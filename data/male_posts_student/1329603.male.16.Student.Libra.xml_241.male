So, I'll know when I'm on my 300th ^O^. Then there can be much merriment. Actually, I should throw a "300th post" party. Or not. That could be the worst idea anyone's ever had, ever.  Oh, and I've been phaffing around with Tobin's amp for around about an hour, just fiddling with echos and stuff. And I've worked out the chord progression for David of the White Rock. How cool...  I'm a looonely man atm.  Love, Jon Roskilly
