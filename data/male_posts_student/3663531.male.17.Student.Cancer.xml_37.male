After 20 minutes of trying to ignore it, I gave up and went into the lounge room, where I could still hear it. Turning on the tv enraged me more, because some crummy cheap cartoon was on, which will be the subject of a different rant... Three minutes later, the basketball noises stop.  I have decided to write a note in blood, and then nail it to their precious basketball.  That'll teach 'em for inadvertantly irritating me!
