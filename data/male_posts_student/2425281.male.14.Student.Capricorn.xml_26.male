Don't kno  how dey thought our skool was a castle, mbe illusions from getting thrashed by melbourne hi in crawford shield, mbe we gotta storm dere castle n steal the shield bak next yr hey guys (sry Mr. I don't play sport and don't use sport in debatin). Wasn't even gonna go until hai chen stuffed his ankle at socca trainin, 1 hr b4 da thing, he alrdy paid so i took his spot :P (I paid him of course). Yeah it was funnish but no offence prefects but organisation sucked. ppl cheated (i was innocent of course, until i stumbled onto a stash of weapons^-^). Dere were all dese rndm cadets in our skool, quite funny really just walking past wen they're all srs n stuff, wif dere funny hats (no offence wayne, ben and co). I got wasted so i gave up and just got absolutely soaked, n it was freezin, shuda thought b4 goin wif singlet n shorts from socca trainin, but i couldn't go home :( neway our group sucked and bloody curry group wif nearly double as many ppl won. Socca 2day guess wat? they forfeit again, u kno in da 6 wks dat i've joined 3rds socca we're undefeated,not to mention the um 3 forfeits, strike, bye etc dat we had hehe. and b4 dat dey lost every game. And i won't post my h/yrly marks ,not to "show some ppl up, namely Andy, wayne" and Jack.
