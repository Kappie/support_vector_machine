People have forgot how to communicate- Instant messaging has brought into the world a new era of asinine conversation and the ability for people to ignore you mid-sentence without having to endure the social pressures perfected over the course of our evolution as a species.  So I am thinking again that it is about time that I abandoned this cursed, monopoly driven technology and move to more staid forms of communication for example e-mail, and telephone.  I will mull over the details tonight, and perhaps compile a list of people that I would like to keep in touch with.  So if anyone wants to know why I no longer use MSN or AIM- it's because no one really ever chats with me...  bye bye IM- I wont miss you.
