My language of choice is Java, simply because I can "easily" manufacture graphical interfaces if needed, and that I'm current with the syntax.  I just don't have the time or motivation to learn C++ better than I do now.  Most of the stuff I'm writing wouldn't benefit from the fabled performance increases C++ has over Java.  For the programming I'm doing for Sesame Place, I've been using Visual Basic since FujiFilm seems to use it as their language of choice for more serious programs, and also because it would allow me to create a user interface that would be easily understandable by the most computer-illiterate of ABAP employees.  For the "programming" I'm doing on the side, I'm going to be converting hard copies of forms to digital templates through the usage of HTML and some sort of proprietary database linkage.  I guess I'll learn more about it when I actually get some forms to try out.
