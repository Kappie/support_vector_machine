So kan cheong.   After that, we went to LJS's to eat. As usual, the cashiers tried to qiao zha me. I said "small drink" in a tight voice. HaHa.   Me and WQ were late for meeting with Hann. Me, Hann, WQ and XC were going to Tampines to buy YH's bag. HaHa. We took 969 to Tampines Central. Yao shu lor!! On the bus, Hann acuused me of liking Ji. He said the signs were obvious. I suddenly said "Where got obvious signs?"! Oh my god! They took it to mean that I admitted I like Ji! I originally meant to ask what were the signs. Die la die la! It will spread to Ah Ji one!! Si le la!  We went to Tampines to buy bag. Tampines Mall, I think. Hann went into this shop called The Wallet Shop. After a fair bit of choosing, XC and Hann chose the same bag. But alas! The store has only 1 stock of the colour they wanted (black and white). However, at the Heeren, they did have stock. Therefore, YH and XC wanted to go Heeren. Me anmd WQ don't want. After eating at a food court, we went our separate ways.  Me and WQ went to shop for his wallet. Shop till 4.15, then WQ went to eat some more. Rou chuo mian, that's what it's called. We took 969 bus home at 4.30. I read my book and also slept there. HaHa. All of the passengers, save for a few, were sleeping. HaHa. Such a funny sight.   I came back home, watched TV and ate dinner. Tada. Here I am. I think I gotta go liao la. See ya tomorrow. Night!
