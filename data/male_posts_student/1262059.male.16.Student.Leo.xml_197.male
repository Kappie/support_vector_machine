Going into it, I was fairly apprehensive (thanks to "The Giver" for the word =P ) ... I was hoping to make this year to be a success, something I had hoped last year, but the one day break I had to take because of Computer Symposium snapped my train of thought.    I was also a bit disappointed... the usual crew that goes is diminished to me and my partner kyle. Opening night was fairly disappointing too... there were some good introductions, but eh... and our Norwegian introductory speech got boo-ed =P it was about how we'd kick their asses in the 2006 Winter Olympics... well, Jason Lee was the one that actually siad the phrase, but still ^^;; could've been better... if Guinea Bassau hadn't stolen our line.    y'see... SJMP people have like... tons of school spirit... and everytime one of those delegates go up, the rest would cheer like crazy ^^;; so like... we thought of saying that we're from SJMP too... but the delegates from Guinea Bassau took those lines before we could say them ^^;; found out from the Libya delegation that they were 9ers from st.mike's... they did pretty good for 9ers.    Anyhow, I won't bored you guys with play-by-play for every one of those days... some highlights:   - the best delegate (Macedonia... a 10er from our school) in EcoSoc was kicked out because of his shoes, while some others were wearing jeans... he lost his steam and didn't participate as much afterwards... leaving the award to an undeserving Haiti delegate... i mean, good gods... i'd support Finland, or Belgium at the least.   - a quarter my saturday school class was there... 2 from SJMP, 1 from st.joseph college, 2 from st.mike's choir, and of course, me ^^;;   - other people i knew was a bunch from brebeuf, and an old gifted classmate ^^;;   - pizza on the first night... and donuts on the other two days   quotable quotes: (not 100% to-the-letter, memory not that good)  - U.S. : "we can get rid of weapons by dumping them in the desert!"  - Haiti : "if we don't reduce the prices for software, people in impoverished nations can't afford them!  - Norway: "Why would people in impoverished nations need to buy software...?"  - (almost lunchtime) Some country: "I motion that we do clause-by-clause voting because there are many points in here that contradict each other, and that voting for this resolution would go against many countries foreign policy."  - Guinea Bassau: "one word... lunch"  - U.S.: "Right of Reply! He just accused us of being terrorists!"  - Macedonia: "what? what was that? i can't hear you because of the bombs dropping"   (Closing ceremonies: odd, random activities)  U.S.: (when asked "if a cat was thrown out of the window, would it be considered kitty litter?")... so NO, it should NOT be considered "kitty litter", how can you call it that??... it's "road kill"   Back to points of interest:   - Jeff Bogues won "best delegate ever".... there were 10 contestants chosen by the audience beforehand through a ballot. There were like 4-5 rounds... one in which they had to answer a not-so-simple question (like the one above), another where they had to advertise a false movie (e.g. The Meatrix, Pirates of Lake Erie, Find Speedo), sing a song about whatever the guy in charge chose, then the final one was why they should be considered world leader   - The candidates were eliminated if they drew the least amount of votes and/or applause. Bogues drew the second-biggest votes/applause until the final round, where he scored an upset over the U.S. delegate from Brebeuf. Hafta hand it to the guy from 'beuf tho... he sure knew how to sing.    - got through a record of 8 resolutions this year. compare this to the two resolutions that we got through last year.    - New rooms were added... NATO and CSD alternated days. Old rooms remained: Security, HR (human rights), GA (general assembly), and EcoSoc (economic/social).   - CSUNA's 10th anniversary is next year   - Bogue's shocked a lot of us by delivering a serious speech about child poverty on opening night... we had expected humour.    - I did a lot better than last year. Compare 3-time Speakers' list, opening night speech, handful of amendments, dozen of "point of orders", a few "point of informations", and a bit of participation in the moderated caucus.... to opening night speech and one "point of order". I also manage to net at least 5 votes for one of the awards... not much, but hey ^^   - While i was gone... my 3-ball team won. So ... we're 2-2-0 now ^^;;    There ends my random ramblings.    Ah... CSUNA was draining... there's a lot of difference between participating a lot, and observing a lot... participation takes more energy, and you have like no time to send pages for fun - something which i did in abundance the years before. It's also a lot like acting... I swear... I have never did so much public speaking on a voluntary basis. I had to feign confidence and humour... it seemed to work well ^^;; except i wasn't consistant... i should've gone up more than i did if i wanted the award.    Ah... guess that'll be all, laterz   ~ Chronos
