"Early Drop Off" is where I get to drop all my furniture off early, so that it is easier to do rather than having to deal with all the crowds on actual move-in. My wrestler is already there, doing ROTC stuff. Hopefully everything will go well, I am all ready to move in with my fridge, TV, and everything else. I think the fridge will be the center-point of my room. All the focus will be around the fridge, and particularly the items inside which will include water, 7-Up (my favorite), as well as lots of salsa for chips, and some fruit to snack on. I'm hoping my wrestler will bring a bunch of vid. games and/or movies. 	I think the worse part about moving away is going to be meeting new people. Not just people, but meeting the type of people you like to hang out with. I don't know we will see. Good luck everyone.
