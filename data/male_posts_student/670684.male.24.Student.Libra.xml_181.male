We discussed Sears/Roebuck, Wal-Mart, the Olive Garden, and Blockbuster Video, but the crux of the argument revolved around Starbucks Coffee.    One of my favorite South Park episodes is the one with Tweek, where the kids come over and the underpants gnomes steal Tweek's underwear for profit, and Tweek's dad owns the local coffee shop, and the Starbucks rip-off wants to come in, but no one will go and they pester the site manager and pelt him with human waste.  Once they try Starbucks' coffee, they find that it tastes better than the stuff Mr. Tweek was shelling out.    I first started drinking coffee when I was 16, thanks to Jessica Zeitler.  Jessica was the Rogers High School cross-country phenom; a red-haired hardbody with a soft smile and sexy attitude.  I met her at a Model Congress in Bentonville; I argued against her bill, something to do with affirmative action or gun control or abortion or taxes...we talked about it after it was over, figured out that we liked one another, and decided to start dating a bit.  She took me to downtown Fayetteville, we shopped the alternative shops, talked about art in philosophical terms, and drank coffee at Arsaga's, the angst-ridden hangout for the University of Arkansas' desolate suburbans.  Later that summer, I explored three or four coffee shops in San Francisco, solidifying my love for chocolately espresso drinks with glorious girls and glorious prices.  One 22 year old in particular caught my eye and introduced me to the delectable world of foamy milk; I wanted her to introduce me to much more, but my adolesence blockaded me (as did my shirt and tie...according to my dad, you always dress up to go to San Francisco...I hope they got a kick out of my big boy pants).  This is only important because from 1996 to 2002, my coffee career revolved around corporate shops, save one or two dozen instances.  Starbucks is everywhere, and it is good coffee.  Outside of San Francisco, I had never tasted better coffee than I could get at Starbucks.  I even spent nine months as a barista, pumping mocha, foaming milk, and making polite conversation with dirty whores who bring their poodles in with them but can't tip you more than a quarter.  I didn't think of Starbucks as a problem, because it tasted good; yeah, its power resembled Wal-Mart, but was I going to get a vanilla pissachino at Circle K instead?  I have a pretentious image to uphold.    I only write about this because I recently vowed to boycott Starbucks.  It was a fit of anger and inspiration; the intrepid traveller, searching out culture and creativity, spurring the black-line world of the carbon paper cafe, finding good conversation, good looking people, and a good double americano on his way.  I was doing it in Austin, why not do it indefinitely?    Yet already, I struggle.  Last week I stopped in at the Arboretum store, talking to a former work friend, and drinking a free cup.  This I talked my way out of; it cost the corporation money to produce my free drink, so in effect, I was hurting Starbucks, and should be heralded for my guerilla tactics.  But today, in need of a comfy chair and a steaming mug of bean water, I walked into the 'bucks near Memorial Drive.    Just parking, I felt dirty.  I quickly walked in, head down, avoiding the glare of the baristas.  My eyes focused on the wall and floorboards...I could still get myself out of this if they didn't have internet connection.  I quickly scanned the lower quadrant of the room, a smorgasboard of vericose veins and Keds, pumping and tapping to the rhythm of Yo-Yo Ma.  I choked.  I gagged.  No internet.  I turned and quickly muscled my way out, bumping into an eager churchgoer on my way.  No Gideon's Bible traded hands.
