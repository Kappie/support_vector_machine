Idestroyed my teams definitions and debated pretty badly, so that was probably the main cause of it. The class also weren't quite following what I said so it was likely that my speech was contradictory and conflicting. I also accepted far too many POIs (Points Of Information), so I ended up wasting a lot of time, forcing me to skip an entire paragraph of useful information I could have used against the opposition! (Rar!)  Sigh... On the contrary however, my Chinese presentation has been better than expected. I got a reasonable 15 out of 20, much to my surprise. The speech was on teen smokers, but it'sdoubt it really represents what I think ofthem of smoking... Hehehe... Get the idea? Anyways, I got screwed for RE today because I didn't have my photographs and I didn't bother to get a CD. Man, how mean some people can be because I only recently ran out of CDs dammit! Those photos were damn big and how do you expect me to lug it to school? Take the whole notebook? Yeah right, and risk losing it in school, just for the sake of a stupid project. What's more, today we were told to assess one another, and guess what were the only marks for each section Alexander gave me. 1 or 2!!! That bloody arrogant idiot thinks that he's so great, and he keeps sneering at me and discriminates against me for no good reason at all. Someday I'll just break him, I swear it.  Heh, the com labs are still kinda faulty 'cos you can't log on to the server on some of the computers, so I'm suspecting a technical fault of some kind. But who cares? They ain't mine, so why bother? I've been given until Friday to complete both the photos and powerpoint presentation... Oh dear oh dear oh dear... Before I finish up thisentry, I just have a request to make: please click on the links I have provided at the top of the page, 'cos I need your support here, thanks. By the way, does anyone know of a job which I can take up? I need the cash... For what? I won't answer that.
