I wanted to wear my tank top but my mom won't let me because it was supposed to rain today. -O-" No rain so far~ Oh well. Gauss math test today. People who didn't do the test stayed in 8R and watched Mrs. Doubtfire. Haha... Funny movie. Doubtfire reminded me of M_____. Roofles! Speaking of M_____, she's across the hall in the primary pod. Weirdness. Anyways... so yeah. Everybody's tired today 'cos of the heat. Funny eh? You feel sleepy and won't get up when it's cold and when it's warm or hot out, then you still feel all tired and stuff. Crazyness.   We talked a bit about the semi-formal dance at Sudbury and Rodway mentioned that we didn't have to wear skirts or dresses or whatever but yeah... I'm gonna wear a long flowy-ish black skirt and I'm looking for a top to go with it too! Hmm, yup. Can't wait until Saturday when I go shopping for it. The top, I mean. I'm probably going to look for a new silver ring too. Might get it engraved. Haha... Iunno. If I DO get the ring, guess what I'm gonna engrave on it? Hee heezZ~ I lost my favourite silver ring so I wanna get a new one. Hopefully a plain silver one with "NIMA" engraved on it. Haha... I'm such a weirdo. Anyways... next topic.  Nima went to the doc yesterday and he said it was nothing serious. Good. I didn't want anything bad to happen. Still, I'm a little worried 'cos you don't just get nosebleeds for no reason! Hmm, I miss him. Hee heezZ~!   Oh yeah! I remembered something I was gonna ask him. I wanted to know if I could sit with him during dinner at grad or whatever. :P HahazZ~! And also wanted to ask him if he wanted to sit together for the bus ride to Sudbury since Vivo and Mark might be sitting together and I know Safee's sitting with Alice. Iunno. He might not want to though. I know that he might want to sit with his guy friends instead. Iunno. Whatever. His choice. 'Cos if I fall asleep on the bus (high chance) then I'd want to be asleep on HIS shoulder instead... like on the ski trip. HahazZ~!   Eww, my wrist is sticky... it's sticking onto the table, where I'm resting 'em as I type. Funnyness. So yeah...  Oh my gosh, you know what? I had gotten 98% on my website but since I lost my rubric, I get 0% on it instead. Dude, this isn't my day... it just isn't my day.  Another thing on my mind... grad. I can't wait until grad 'cos it'll be a lot of fun but I don't want to graduate yet because high school will mean our friendships drifting apart a little and stuff... *sniff sniffzZ* Sadness... and there are A LOT more pretty girls in high school whom Nima will meet and it's not that I don't trust him, it's that I don't trust the girls. Haha! 'Cos Nima's not a bad guy and he's really sweet and friendly with everyone. He might come across some really really nice and pretty girl whose really friendly and possibly flirty and he might fall for her... like he used to. Iunno. I love him and I don't EVER want to lose him. Seriously. Even if he doesn't flirt which he promised to not do, the girls might flirt with him. I don't like high school. :( *sighzZ* I can't do anything... but pray.    If my alien is reading this, I want him to know that I love him...
