Here's the runthrough of the past week: 1)I'm mad at my dog right now, since he chewed up 3 of my Gamecube games  and  my Gameboy Advance!!! 2) I was going to put this on my other site, but 2 nights ago was one of the biggest events in my 13-years of living:  SpongeBob's Lost Episode!!!   3) Last night was the school dance and Mike blew off Mandy urlLink   by not showing up for their "date" that night. That's all for now!
