As for that whole college thing, I actually thought about taking a year off before I went if I decided to go, too.  Sorry if this blog seems bland or my thoughts seem unorganized, I've got a little in my system. Just sitting here reading what you people haveta say gets my stomach wrenching with some type of anxiety I haven't felt in a while, b/c right now, it's all on the surface, since its the drop. Head's pounding a bit, but it might just be my imagination. I still can't shake that eerie feeling from me...like someone taking my intestines, squeezing them, then tying them into a know, then wraping them around my heart, as it strains under the pressure, giving me images of every one being lost in their own confusion and I can't help but think that I might've been the cause or maybe even contributed the dosage of doubt needed.  So all I'll do is be...yeah...thats it...and take it in. I'll just hear what you have to say and observe you, that way, nothing'll affect me, and I can't affect you.   Yeah, going away to college would be nice, but personally, even though I do know you, I can't really see the whole party girl thing...dunno.  Still dunno who American Hi-Fi is, but, they sure don't sound that good. Must be my prejudice and ironic closed-mindedness.   It's a lot to take in...all at once...heh....I can still laugh...it is kinda funny...but then I feel my heart squeeze again...its an odd sensation...there it goes again.  I'm Deadinside, I haven't spoken to myself so honestly in such a long time.  "On the brink of insanity, it is but a narrow bridge."
