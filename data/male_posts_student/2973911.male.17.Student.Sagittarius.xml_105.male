I went in front of St. Paul College, Cubao to wait for her outside. I came 2:40pm. I smoked 2 sticks of "Winston Lights" (sponsor, naks!) while waiting for her to come out. It was already 3:00, my sticks were all gone, and still no signs of her. I decided to wait 'till 3:30. I stood behind the shadows of the school's wall because the sunlight's pretty hot. It was on the opposite side where she goes out.   And i saw her walking alone, holding a book. I tried to follow her with a 4-meter distance (i think). I was thinking if i should talk to her or not, but i decided not to show myself to her (because she said she'll get mad at me if i go there without her permission). I was trembling, and my heart was pounding fast. She looked back, as if she knows someone's following her... and i looked back as well, where she won't see my face (good thing i wore bonnet and shades). Then she went to the other side of the road, and i stopped from following her... but i stayed at my current position and watched her leave. Watching her face, there seems to be anger... i don't know if it's from the school or if it's from somebody's trying to follow her.  Darn... then i went to SM Centerpoint to loose some tension and played DDR (Dancerev) and Percussion Freaks. But i just can't remove it from my mind... (sorry 'bout this, just posted a blog)
