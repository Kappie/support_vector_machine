We drove up and parked near the Youth Hostel and hiked .8 miles down the Laguna Trail, From there we took the Fire Lane Trail about a mile to meet up with the Coast Trail. Once we hit the Coast Trail we hike up through the camp sites there. Our plan was to hike down far enough to venture off down some steep deer trails towards Secret Beach but we were side tracked but an awesome little beach that we could barly see from the trail. The valley created by the Santa Maria Creek made a little hole through the cliffs. We found a small of shoot trail and took a risk. What we found was just perfect. The little brook was emptying out on the beach making a lush tide pool that only reaches the ocean at high tide. In between the pool and the waves were a whole lot of gulls with there new young all grey and unkept. We thought we were alone but right near the cliffs to our right were two naked chicks sun bathing. They didn't seem to care, mimi and I giggled and headed south on the beach. We stopped at every tide pool and watched the green anemones and crabs just hanging out. Lots of blue mussels clung to the exposed rocks just off shore. After about a mile we ran into the Sculpted Beach and found a little rocky cove to sit and eat our lunch. Yumm, so them we hiked up another trail and met back up with the Coast Trail. From there we went back to the car. About a 5 hour hike, just a little sun burnt but not back at all. Seriously the most fun I have had in a while.  Today I worked at both jobs, got paid and filled up the tank. Was a bit annoying at the bookstore but we had a new shipment and that is fun. New stuff to check out.  Oh Jeremy, I might be out there soon, I have a Barn Owl I need to release in lodi. It was found in a truck cover in 2 tons of saw dust. In the dust somewhere. He's in good shape and hella pissed so that will be fun. ;) Maybe when we release him he will chase us all around with his fat talons.  So yeah, Good times, beach fun!   current mood:  indescribable current music: Murder City Devils - Press Gang
