He has seen Karean used it and understands that the impact would be too fast to counter.  Suddenly, Karean leaped towards Tai Wu and brought him down…just fast enough to evade the lethal strike of this servant. His strike is so powerful and fast, that it resembled a bullet train ready to crash onto someone…no even stronger than that. The impact of the stroke pulled Tai Wu and Karean along; even though they avoided it, they were pulled close due to the high pressure and vacuum created. The crossing air cuts through their face and exposed skin while throwing them off balance as well, landing quite a distance away.  After experiencing the blow, Tai Wu lift himself up from the ground…he saw the servant standing with his right hand bent forward now while left hand stretch to the back, exactly the same position as Karean after she did the same move. Tai Wu stood up and retrieved Flamer that is placed nearby, this opponent won’t be easy.  ???, “Missy!! How are you?! Why did you defend this guy here?!”  Karean is laying on the floor, gradually sitting up…looking quite irritated, “Kaito, you idiot! I told you not to enter without my permission yet you did! Do you even have any respect for me?!”  Kaito, “But Missy, I was told to hunt down any guy or intruder who enters your room, even if you allowed him to.”  Tai Wu, “No way…Karean! Is this true?”  Karean remained quiet…looking rather apologetic. Seeing this, Tai Wu cannot believe it, all the things and story about the future may be just a lie…everything is uncertain for him now.  Karean, “Tai Wu, don’t get me wrong! I didn’t mean for this! Just that Master demanded for your presence and wants you to enter my room…even though I didn’t know why she wants me to…”  Tai Wu, “And you just listen to that master of yours?! How can you!” He shouted furiously.  Karean, “I cannot help it can I? I came to this strange world, helpless and nobody to depend on…Only Master provided help to me! What do you expect me to do?! Master took care on me and was the only one to believe that I’m from another world, she provided information and help me to survive in this world! I can’t disobey her can I?! Plus, I don’t even know who you are…she just wanted your arrival, I don’t feel it’s an unreasonable request!”  Tears are starting to emerge from her eyes; the emotions, voice and all were real.  Tai Wu couldn’t rebut…he didn’t have the reasons nor the heart to do so; he wanted to apologize but couldn’t bring himself to.  Kaito, “Stranger! You made Missy cry, I won’t forgive you!”  Once again, Kaito displayed the Sen Arashi’s Dai Kai Sen posture. Tai Wu focused on his opponent now; if he wants to live…he’ll have to win. He lifted the heavy blade and placed a relatively defensive position, ‘Dai Kai Sen’ is a very offensive strike added with the inflexibility of Flamer, defend is the only choice.  Kaito, “…Prepare yourself!”  As fast as a lightning flash, Tai Wu immediately felt a heavy blow onto his blade. Kaito has gone for straight confrontation and the force is unbearable. Tai Wu was knocked off balance and was thrown backwards, slamming into a wall behind him. Particles of stone came off as Tai Wu fell forward; the impact has made a dent in the solid wall  Tai Wu, “Damn…is this it…”  Kaito, “Not bad…you can still stand.”  Tai Wu heard the compliment or rather sarcasm…He knows that as long as Kaito continues this move, he won’t win…yet he has no way to counter it. However, Tai Wu stood up again, his body aching all over.  Karean, “Tai Wu! Enough! You can’t win this.”  Tai Wu, “…”  Kaito, “Hah, Good man…one more time!”  Tai Wu tried lifting Flamer, but his strength gave up.  Tai Wu murmured, “Hah…Flamer…is that all?”  Karean, “Tai Wu…”  Tai Wu, “Flamer! Is that all you’ve got!” Flamer started glowing a dim orange light.  Seemingly gained confidence, Tai Wu grabs firmly onto the handle of Flamer, “Flamer, if you’re really my fate…then let this arrogant fool see what you can do!”  Abruptly, the orange light emitting from Flamer erupted into flames, leaving only the hilt as something solid to hold as Flamer turned into a sword of pure fire. Since the main body of the sword was transformed into a non-matter fire, only the weight of the hilt remained.  Now, Flamer was weightless…Tai Wu easily lifted Flamer and faced Kaito.  Tai Wu, “Show me your Sen Arashi, Dai Kai Sen again. I’ll counter it!”
