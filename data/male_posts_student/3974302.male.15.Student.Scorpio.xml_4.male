This is my first post here, and I'm itching to get to bed, so I am going to explain away some rough things that typically can be very difficult for an Idea like this to overcome.   -I'm going to need LOTS of people with a variety of skills. Apply by emailing me.  urlLink dakro@myway.com    -The BackStory is Basically Taken Care of, due to a few weeks of homework on my part. It spawns from Battletechabout 100 years before the Succession Wars, (really big wars that destroyed a whole bunch of kingdoms and technology).
