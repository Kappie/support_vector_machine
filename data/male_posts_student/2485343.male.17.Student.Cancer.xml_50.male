Find someone you love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find this person? Forget your head and listen to your heart...Run the risk. If you get hurt, you'll come back. Because the truth is, there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love---well, you haven't lived life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived...
