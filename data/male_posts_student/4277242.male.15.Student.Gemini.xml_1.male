"...These are the JIAK KAN TANG (eat potato) people who meet so often.[...] I HATE SUCH PEOPLE. Wait, hate is not enough, let's make it CURSE THEM ALL TO ETERNAL HELL.      Most of these people would be   1) Speaking with a stupid American/any other "superior English" accent   2) Coming from English-speaking girl and boy schools like ACS or MGS   3) Constantly whining about a lack of freedom and space in SG.   4) Saying Singapore sucks and they would fly away at their youngest age possible.   5) Have freckles"      Let's just say that I need space to rant...      You (whoever wrote that or whoever else that has same thoughts about my linguist minority) are an ignorant rant and an idiot. We have the rights to speak English with accents! It is absolutely not that we want to be someone else other than Singaporean, we like to do this kind of thing! For the damn-bloody fun of it! We know we are the ethnic Chinese and we don't the bloody-flopping-helluva-hell want to be non-Singaporeans at all! It's appreciating other cultures, and aint that what we the Singaporeans have been crazy that larst decade?! Damn you racist bastard! Damn you the National Socialist rottweiler! Damn you   people who ostracise us language-players for our language!      You know about how our sort of people feel confined here? It's all with people like you! People that will dao us when we greet them! People that murmur back whatever you are saying! People who insult you! I had ten-whole-months of clinical depression because of people like you! Patriots? Bah!    Where has the greenery gone? Where did the stars go? Is it not you who took the charms off the trees? Is it not you who took the glitter off the skies? What is life when you live with people who hate you? What is life when you live with the land that shirks from you? It is not life at all! It is hell! The bloody hell hell! And I lived it for ten months!      What is your love for your country? Is it love at all? No! It is xenophobia! I had not been ashamed to call myself Singaporean. I was proud! When I see you, I have second thoughts! How can you inject such vulgar mindsets into what makes us Singaporean? We don't deserve this! How can you deem countries lousier? The Africans don't deserve this either! You are IMMATURE. You have the physique of an adult and the mind of an angry child. I wouldn't be surprised if I tilted your head and shook it your brain cells will come out through your ear-hole.      How could you insult potatoes? How could you so blatantly label potatoes as ang-mor? Back at my granny's home in China, we eat our bloody potatoes too! In my school canteen, we eat the bloody potatoes too! And it isn't even the western food stall! Potatoes are good for you! You are an idiot who can even discriminate against food! Congratulations!      PS: I am not a bloody kantang! I am what you say is a kantang! If everyone on this isle thinks like you, it's to hell with racial harmony! Bye.      Please be reminded that this is all spontaneous ranting. Please don't sue me if you are pissed off by my above essay. Just send a comment. Politeness goes a long long way...
