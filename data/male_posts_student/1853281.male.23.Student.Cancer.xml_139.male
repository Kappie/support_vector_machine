I am going out to dinner tonight with the Mum's to Lucia's so that should be nice, and i might hang out with them on sunday. Saturday is my party, and i am in no way prepared. House is a mess, so it will be a late night tonight, i am sure. 23 in two days...funny. I don't even care. Birthdays really don't mean much to me. It will be nice to hang out with everyone, have a little party, etc. Happy holiday weekend(and by holiday i mean when the world was blessed with such a treasure as myself.)
