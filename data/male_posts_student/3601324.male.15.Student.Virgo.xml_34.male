Here, I'll put it into a general dialogue for your viewing pleasure.   Nutcase:  SEXUAL HARASSMENT!  Lady That Sells Roses Next To Me And My Dad:  OHHH! HELP!  Me:  CONFUSION!  Nutcase:  HEY, I NOTICE YOU NOW!  Me:  DAMN!  Nutcase:  THREATENING STATEMENT!  Me:  SILENCE TREATMENT!  Nutcase:  OHHH! IT BURNS LIKE KRYPTONITE! I LEAVE NOW!  Now here's how it would go if I  wasn't  a wimp.   Nutcase:  SEXUAL HARASSMENT!  Lady:  OHHH! HELP!  Me:  WHAT YOU SAY?!  Nutcase:  HEY, I NOTICE YOU NOW!  Me:  STATEMENT REFERRING TO VIGILANTE JUSTICE!  Nutcase:  THREATENING STATEMENT PROBABLY WITH SOME SORT OF PUN!  Me:  QUESTIONING NUTCASE'S ABILITY TO FIGHT!  Nutcase:  SMACK TALK!  Me:  SCRAWNY ARM  SMAAAASH !  Nutcase:  OHHH! PWNED! I LEARNED  MY  LESSON!  Haha. Yeah. Showed him.
