Greeks are successful because of their hard work and I am sure they'll do well in the world cup. Hi to my friends in Yishun Town Secondary school and about the backout in the school today...I wish it would have lasted longer...or something...Spider man 2 was awsome but it was more than what I am waiting for...maybe I'll finally get to meet Jojo? She's way too awsome! I love her music!!! Life moves and what can I say? People change...Soccer rocks! Greeks are cool!  ~  Maybe when I finally get up...god will greet me!
