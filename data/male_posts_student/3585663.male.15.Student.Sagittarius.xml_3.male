I can't believe i actually made a wrong decision, 2 pon my F class, dis totally upset my teacher(miss seerin). Sincerely saying sorrie. Haiz, den today oso sort of quarrel wif my stead lor, even though i dun think it is a quarrel. Dis even make me more sad, cause it added 2 e sense of guilt tat is in mi. Totally depressed type man, just can't hang on, dying soon le. Thought of lots of things today, but better not 2 think too much le. I luv my Jane Jane veri much one, dun wish 2 hurt her in anyway so in e end........i get her 2 laugh again. At least one task settled, nut e feelin of guilt is still there...........
