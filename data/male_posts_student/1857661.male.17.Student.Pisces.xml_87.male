And I'm here, blogging, after playing my PS2.   ~ Started a new game called Onimusha 3:Demon Siege. Heard of it? The game uses the faces of Takeshi Kaneshiro and Jean Reno as their main characters. It's a cool game. The settings are in France and Kyoto, Japan. The story's a bit complicated, but the samurai(Takeshi) is way too cool. So far, I've discovered 3 swords that can be used. They are thunder sword, wind sword, and fire sword. Sounds cool, huh? Overall, I give it a rating of 8/10. (It's given a 8.3/10 in gamespot.com)  Here are some of the screenshots from the game.
