ICE CREAM!  ice cream is extremely good, and I probably ate 20 pounds of it on the cruise.  Who cares thoughhhh?  I have nothing else to say right now I'll probably post again tonight once I get thinking?  can't you look at me once? and please if you've got a minute enjoy this lonely sky with me it'll swallow us whole if we only let it
