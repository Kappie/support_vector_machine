OUR LIFE? somehow it looks like it's goin to crazh any moment... we're like so unstable now... argh... so stressed... school... and her... can't she understand i'm now rushing... stupid moe wans a 16 week lesson squeezed in 13 weeks.. that's so rush... and she doesn't give me the support that i so desperately need right now... f**k f**k f**k...
