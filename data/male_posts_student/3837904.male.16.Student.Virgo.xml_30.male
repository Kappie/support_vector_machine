My verdict:   It's time I humble down and start the fresh. I've all not wanted separation. Regardless of on which side it is. We shall never end up in tears, misery and despair. And we should let things go easy now. Complete depletion ain't the right track. For I humbly pray: We all get back together again.     Their words:   She had spoken. I've understood now. And her words are harsh. Her words are re-occurring in my mind. And Rachael would made it possible with all her sentences that she puke it all out on me. As her words are strong. And her sentences are all mighty towards me.
