Tomorrow, I'll have my last I.U. Day. It will be my last time spending time with people from other school as in big groups in a big event. Sigh... I feel quite sad for leaving the board soon. I had been having so much fun by meeting new people. Well, life moves on and things will change. But it was too quick. I wonder how many friendships will actually continue after the break-up...
