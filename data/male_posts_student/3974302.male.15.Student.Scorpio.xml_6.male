I need someone (who is not working on aliens. Yes, she knows I'm talking to her. 'What about the other girls?' What other girls!? Shutup or get outta my head you piece of alien scum!  STONEHENGE.  Oh, Did I just hint that I think Celtic religion would be a good one? Oops. The aliens should be about a next to impossible challenge for us to face, be it through technological superiority or just overwhelming numbers of genetically engineered super-chickens.) As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, I need someone to work on the "Means and the Motive" of our trip to another galaxy. Why did we do it and how did we get cut off from Earth (or Terra or whatever) so completely that we were forced to start anew on the planets with no palpable plans whatsoever? That's about it for the old, in with the new. You guys must post  at least  once every thirty days before you lose your position as Empire commanders. You may still be able to contribute but it will probably never be at the same level as before. Another big post will come in roughly 5 min. After I relogin to the Library internet.
