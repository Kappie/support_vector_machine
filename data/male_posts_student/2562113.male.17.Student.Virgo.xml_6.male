Hopefully everything goes to plan and their is a place to go.  My biggest problem for now is decided what beer to get for tomorrow, I've narrowed it down to two finalists.  1st is my all time favorite beer Rolling Rock, then I could aways go crazy and buy Heinei's but the question is do i want to shell out to money.  Better sleep on it in order to make the right decision.  I'll leave with a tribute to a wounded soldier                       --"In Heaven Everythings Allright"--   [KakaSMUT]
