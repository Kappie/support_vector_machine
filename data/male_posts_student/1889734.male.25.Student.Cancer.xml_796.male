It's gratifying to see his reaction to the murder of Paul Johnson and the subsequent killing of the thugs who murdered him, even if the Saudis acted too late.  Excerpt- "It is confirmed now that Abd-Alaziz Bin-Essa Bin-Hammad Al-Muqrin (33 years) the leader of the Qaeda in KSA and top two of his thugs (Faisal  Abdulaziz Al-Dakheel) have been send to HELL killed. He was most likely the one who appeared in the video of Falluja Brigade which threatned to kill PJ. The question is not how he was killed but why not have been captured before or killed? And is this means the Saudi securty have not done enough to crak down the terrorist? Now the Saudi securty received the orders to finish Muqrin only now to avoid the wrath of the civilized people! Why not before!? Why not before? A big question need not answers but millions of answers! Finish the Wahabism which is the doctrine and ideology feeds the terrorists! Hell is the place of Muqriin and soon for Zarqawi! "
