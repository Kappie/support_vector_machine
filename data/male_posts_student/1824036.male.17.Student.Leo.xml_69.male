I didn't know what we were going to do but it turnes out that we were going to install a super huge-o-fricking-mondo refrigerater door. It pry weighed 1000 lbs...maybe more maybe less. We tore down a bunch of stuff and I got to sweep up after Jim (Jadie's dad) and "O-D" (Jim O'Donnald...who oddly enough was my bus driver from about 1st grade til about 5th grade). Then I got really excited when he said help me with this heavy stuff...so we moved it and he said..."Use this chisle to scrape off all the extra caulk off of this metal..." I was crushed...but I did as I was told.  More pointless work...and a few mini throw ups (from the stench of over-salted meats) later, I finally got a good job. This piece of heavy thing (the sliding hinge for the top of the door) had to be moved onto the wall. So me and Jim were to walk up a ladder with it....and to make a long story short...THE DOOR LIVES. Then I cleaned up one last time and went home a little more "Beef'd up" with pride.
