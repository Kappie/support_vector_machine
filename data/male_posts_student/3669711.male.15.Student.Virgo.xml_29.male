So, i open up BSPlayer, load the file, and am surprised....    I found out (after watching the 40 minute OVA) that this was not even a part of TLS.  It was part of a whole different anime called Interlude, which i had downloaded because it was on the same sourceforge page as as TLS was on.  It didn't kick in that it might be part of a totally seperate anime.      Well, it turned out to be a horror/zombie thing, where shadows would detach from their humans, and like humans would turn into zombies and there is a weird firey dog and it would kill people.  Quite odd indeed.  But the strange thing is that i want to see the rest of the series.  It must be that i got into the story a little.      Now to watch some Azumanga!      Lates
