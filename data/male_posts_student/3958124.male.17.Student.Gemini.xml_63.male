I had a great time seeing friends and a greater time living it up, college (fake) style.  If you haven't heard, there is a great cartoon up over at  urlLink JibJab . I'm a little behind reporting this, but if you complain you probably won't be able to appreciate this masterpiece anyway. It's called "This Land is Your Land" and features such appearances as George W. Bush, John Kerry, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bill Clinton. Watch it and revel in it's hilarity.   Less sooner.
