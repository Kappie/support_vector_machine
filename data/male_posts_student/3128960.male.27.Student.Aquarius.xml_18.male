"A music fan" writes, "I remember the day 'Speak English or Die' hit the scene when I was in high school. There was a real division beginning between punkers and metal heads where I was at and part of it was because of the violence from nazi skinheads beating up metal heads for having long hair. Since regular skinheads were kind of considered punkers and hard to tell apart from nazis, alot of metal heads were getting pissed at punks in general.  Some of my better friends were head bangers and we were all bummed about the whole affair. Well, when we heard 'United Forces' come ripping from the vinyl in a vocal and chord crunching assault testifying that '...it doesn't matter how you wear your hair, it's what's inside your head...' we were stoked.  Here was this band, 2500 miles from where we were at, talking about the same problem tellin' everybody to lighten up. I listened to this album exclusively for almost a half a year, and there was a lot of killer music then. As far as I'm concerned, these guys are the god fathers of speedcore and if you don't own it, at least hear it once. These guys were a major influence on metal to come!!"   Just remember, it doesn't matter how you wear your hair when everyone is united. Godbless the Crossover. Lighten the fuck up everyone. Learn English and Beware the Milano Mosh.  Although, I must impart one rejoinder. The process of crossover, while undoubtedly for the better in the long run, will produce some abhorrent mostrosities as it unfolds. See for instance D.R.I. post-1987. I mean, the video for "Suit and Tie Guy"--c'mon guys.
