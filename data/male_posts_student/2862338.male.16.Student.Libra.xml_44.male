Well, ok, on to the journal part of the entry...Um, alot has happened that i refused to type about for some reason.  Antiock on sunday was pretty cool, it was kinda short for me, but i guess cause i was having fun! :D, but anyway, um, that saturday was NUTS.  We ended up chilling and shit.  Theres SOOOO much shit i can say about that day (nothing bad) but i won't, it would juss take to long, so i'll juss do my "highlights" if you will....um, i ordered like, my first thing from starbucks that wasn't advertised on TV. i ordered this double chocolate sticky icky fudge brownie tall Mocha-chino thing....it was damn good.  Um, what else.....Dana licked Kornhouser's nipple.....and mike got freaked out when i put my arm around Steph. (you shoulda have seen his face! it was mad funny).  The first 2 are pretty stright foward, but i feel i should clear up the last one.  See, we were all kinda stuffed in Maryb's car, me, steph (in the middle) and benny were in the back.  Well, during the first part of the night, (the starbucks part) we all had our arms all scrunched up and shit, so i was like, shit, this sucks...well then, i looke over, and ben and steph are in a similar situation.  Well, i guess my horomones were raging, cause then i ask if  can just put my arms around her...not around her body, juss like, around her over the seat......well, yadda, yadda, yadda, i kinda get a feeling she wants me to put my arm around her (forgive me if i'm wrong), so, i did, and lol, thats around the time mike turned around.  Well, ya, it lasted until like, i got dropped off.  Now, lol, if i think i know who's reading this, your gonna wanna know how i felt....well, you know something? i felt pretty damn good.  I mean, maybe it's cause i haven't gone out with anyone for a long time, or maybe it's juss cause it lasted so long, but it juss felt....cool? lol, maybe wrong word, but i dunno, it was juss cool.....what made it COOLER was that i had hardly talked to her during the weekend and what not, we were like juss a noch above aquantices.  Well, since then, we've gotten to know each other better, and i'm even going to her prom....so i think it's safe to say i've reached freind level :o).  But, now that i've answered that little query, i brung up a new one....."so are you gonna go out with her?"....lol, most of my close circle of freinds have asked me that question...and the answer is a simple "i have no idea".....though i haven;t been out with a girl in a while, i'm definitly not juss going to rush into one as soon as i think i have an oppurtunity.....you see, i'm a firm beliver on "juss let things happen", not for alot of situations, but for most, so thats how i want this to go.  If something happnes, it happens, ya know? So, i mean, i guess if something DID happen i'd prolly go out with her....that is if she even likes me, cause i can;t read minds ya know :oD.  Well, ya, so thats that, i mean, nothing more on that i guess....um, maybe i should juss layout my 3 day weekend huh?   Ok, thurs, today, went to school (duh), did the learning thing, and went to mikes after it to get rides.  At first we didn;t get em', but Jones'  dad Hooked me and rob up. um, then, tonight (acutally, like a half hour ago) we go to Jones' for some Risk/Axis and Allies.  The group went as follows: Czank, Me, Jones, Jorge, Mike, Andy, John, Rick, Zach, and some other kid who's name i forgot.  But, unfortunatly, we split up the groups, and each circle was seperated.  Kinda sucked, but dun't matter.  Ok, now TOMMAROW get's complicated.  I have to add before i go on i have A SHIT load of APUSH HW i have to do, but let's continue.  Tommarrow is suppose to go down like this....band practice at someones house for something i can't mention, whihc includes me, hernie, and jorge, and maybe someone else, i have no idea.  Then, later that night, were suppose to get a SHIT LOAD of people to go bowling.  Now, practice is in like morning/afternoon and Bowling is like afternoon/how ever long it lasts.  BUT, today, cause we didn;t go to robs to see the 2 seasons of the critic, and play karoeke revolution, we might do that tomarrow too...and all that leaves NO room for HW.  Saturday should be easier.  I dun think anything is happening in the afterrnoon that i know of, or remember, so that gives me time for HW, but i'm almost positive i'm going somewhere....it always happens like that....but anyways, that night (were talking kinda late) were suppose to go see DAwn of the dead, which is apparently good, with a buncha people, but we still need more cars.  Sunday, in the afternoon i have another driving lesson (i had one today) and then the time between that and Antioch i can do more work.  Then antioch, then home, and school starts the next day.....ya, exciting huh? Well, this is NOT including what the Snow will Due to any of the Carpools....hopefully nothing.  But ya, thas the run-down, it might change, prolly will change, but thats how it looks right now.    new subject, new subject, new subject....hmmm......um.... o yeah, i finally went to the gym today! i felt soooooooooo outa shape, so it felt real good to go back in there.  I wasn;t there for as long as i wanted to be, but i think thats because i wasn't there for so long, and becuase of that i got weaker, and therefor it took less to "work" me out.  but w/e.  My Driving instructor is madd cool.  He's Hispanic, and me being B-lingual really helps....i hate people struggling to speak english.  He's the same teacher Umi had apperently....small world huh?  i hav e no idea what to say......i keep thinking about wondering whats going to happen on the weekened, cause i KNOW a good amount on antioch people are gonna be there. crazy....and ya, i'm kinda thinking about steph too...damn you guys, you bastards!! >:o)  um, well, ya, i guess the only other thing for me to say is....um......nothing.....lol, sorry folks, but thats it, it's 5 minutes to 12, and seeing as i woke up at six today, i'm TIRED....so yah, sorry for any typos in advance, and good night....O!! check out the...wait........
