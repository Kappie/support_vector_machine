I got to debate about Nevada topics, such as the schools, Yucca Mountain, water, and growth in the Valley. The only bad thing was this guy named Ryan who attends Chap (and is an ass if you ask me) asked if I carried heat to Rancho because Rancho is "unsafe". Why does everyone and their uncle thinks Rancho is unsafe? Since when has Rancho been unsafe? Is it because we have a larger Hispanic population? I don't know the answer, but Ryan goes to Chap. Come on here people. We all know Chap is more dangerous then Rancho. Rancho is one of the safest schools in Clark County. Chap isn't. So he has no where to talk. Rancho has a bad rap which needs to end. But moving on...  We talked about many topics, but I liked the topic about the school district. We never really went back to it, but I liked it. I wanted to see how other students felt about the over crowding in the schools, and while we are suffering our lovely superintendent, Carlos Garcia drives a Lexus and gets a gas card. Why? Oh great School Gods, why?  Other then the Sun Youth Forum, my life has been relatively quiet. I bleached my hair on Friday. Boy did I get some weird looks and comments at school on Monday. I only got two nice comments from Desiree and Stefani. I know Stefani wouldn't diss on my hair, but come on people. It isn't THAT bad. See what I mean?     Is it honestly that bad? Keep in mind it is 8:30 at night, so my gel isn't THAT good, but still. Cut me some slack here people.  I apologize for not updating the website with my stuff lately. Hopefully it won't happen much anymore. Tomorrow is Wednesday. Fun fun fun. Then TURKEY DAY! I'm going to be spending it with family friends. I was gonna go to El Paso and visit Mike, but he is going to officer training school then going to Korea. Why do you ask? Because the DAMN military is saying he has to. God I hate the government right now. Why is it so corrupt? Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Well I'm done ranting. I will post more this week. I will have pictures from Thanksgiving too!
