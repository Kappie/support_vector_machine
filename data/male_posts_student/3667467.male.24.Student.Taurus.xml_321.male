If you know anyone with three names that's famous, please tell us what they are. We're brainstorming and need a good list. Some examples:  James Earl Jones Mary Kate Olsen Billy Ray Cyrus  Like all our other songs, they will Rock. Trust me.   Tonight I became a perfectionist in the studio. Joe can't keep time and it's hurting the band. He's got to tighten up his solos or he's out on his @$$.
