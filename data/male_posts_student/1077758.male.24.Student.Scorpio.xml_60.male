But we've submitted basically 3 things in the fiction writing class I'm in right now, and every time, the teacher, while reading them aloud or to herself, has commented in some fashion or the other that my writer's voice is, and I quote, "Great".  There are some pretty darned good writers in that class too, so I'm taking it as a heck of a compliment.  But on a sad note, the teacher did NOT like the fact that I tried to write from the perspective of a woman in my latest story.  This I found intriguing--most fiction has to deal with this at some point in a writer's career, and if anything, I want to be challenged while I'm in this class.  So, I'm not sure how to take it.  But I'm at least confident in my skills, something I've always had a problem saying before.   Maybe it's a sign of things to come.  P.S. Sherry and I are going to catch a flick tomorrow night, but danged if I know what we want to see. Not much on, honestly.
