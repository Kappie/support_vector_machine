Friends, Im sure that we are friends, but Im cannot confirm that we will be more than  JUST FRIENDS .     "Suffering" is the only word to describe my situation. Ironically, somehow it will become my favourite pastime to peek at her curvature. What is of LOVE? It makes me fells like angel, yet it brought me deeper into suffering. Why do the cell in my gens cause me to fall in love with her? Why!? Maybe it wil be the only thing that will bright up my life, giving me the thoughts of opportunity. Or maybe its a challenge for me to take?
