Anyway, valann is a girl that i'm madly in love with, but she lives in PEI, while i live in Manitoba...we met on the internet and got all close and stuff and i went there and MET HER...keep in mind that im only 17 and so me going there all by myself is quite the accomplishment for me...anyway...in PEI i discovered that she was an even more wonderful girl then i had ever thought possible, increasing my already present love for her...anyway, PEI was the best experience of my life, we got all close and everything was perfect, but eventually i had to come home...dissappointments...ack...soon after however...valann came to live with me for a while...everytime im with her i fall more and more in love with her...the first time i left it was hard...but when she left today it was really unbearable...i cried whenever i was alone...and you should maybe understand that this is a very serious matter...since i never cry...the only times i ever remember crying are things to do with valann...anyway...there's a little something to maybe help you understand what im talking about if i mention things like valann...or a trip somewhere...or missing her...or that sort of thing...okay? okay...      Hellz
