I plan to send a lot of postcards, but probably only one per person/class.  I don't know whether or not to e-mail people, since everything important is going to be blogged anyway.  I guess I'll just e-mail in response to e-mails.  Which reminds me, everybody give a holler (holla?) via e-mail.  Unless you're online before five pm, I won't be able to talk to you on AIM.  I got two new interviews at Mock Trials yesterday, Hiro and John.  I felt bad because I told Luba I would interview her but never got around to it.  Hiro was somewhat insulting, but I got some good material out of him.  John was almost completely inaudible, even when I turned up the volume on his clip to the maximum level, but his was still pretty good.  Will's interview still reigns supreme.  When I get back, remind me to show y'all the video.  It'll take a few days to prepare, so we ought to have some big thing the weekend after I come back showing the movie etc.  As is the first title of my movie, "Au Revoir, Jewton!"
