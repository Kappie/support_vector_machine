Mom and Dad were trying to be sarcastic and found out that I was sick which makes this whole thing completely screwed over. They better let me go, or I'll throw a temper tantrum. I would do it, too. Just ask Michael.  In other news, I had to go to baseball practice in the condition I'm in. At least there were only 5 guys there so it didn't take forever to make me feel like I was gonna die. Which I feel like anyway, so whatever.  I hear Miracle  in the other room. You know, that hockey movie about how the USA beat Russia in the Olympics, completely surprising everyone all over the world. Not to say the world was unhappy, they were waiting for Russia to get beat for 20 years. "Do you believe in miracles? YES!" Same announcer who does hockey now did that game. And that quote was the most chilling part of the movie. Gave me the goosebumps, simply because I'm a big hockey person.  Mommy and daddy are home with my banana split! That should make me feel better! YAY! Bye, everyone!
