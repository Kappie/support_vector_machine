Ooooooh noooo. -Atomic Kitten, "The Tide is High"   Woot woot! it's my b-day month!  July was insane, and it all started where June left off. On July second I was outside tanning cause i wanted to look good. the thought of Dominic being gay made me realize there are probably a lot of other gay guys in Santa Cruz too. so i tanned. and then i fell alseep. and 2 hours later i woke up burned. my whole front side was red. ouch.  i took a shower and put some aloe on it... but it didnt really help.  on the fourth I went with Ili to wilder ranch. i pathetically hoped that she'd invite dominic but she didnt. that little runt. jk!!~ wilder was a lotta fun... except i was burned... and the ice cream melted... but i had my stars and stripes boxers on!! mm yeah. then, when i got back home, my grandparents came over and we had pie and stuff. oo! and the fireworks were soooo cool! my dog like wet himself, but he does that every year.  the next day jamie, maya and kristen came over.  have i mentioned maya before? maya's a really smart and really cool person from shoreline. i've known her since the end of sixth grade when we had drama together. shes lots of laughs and shes really smart. her bat mitzvah was soo much fun!  ok~ yeah.. jamie and maya and kristen came over and we watched buffy. :-D! The Hush episode was really scary and my burn was really itching. ooh yeah, and jamie broke her leg and she had to go to the ER room on the second (the same day i got my burn!).  anyway, that was fun and then it was over..  so the next day i went to see Legally Blonde 2 with Kalie, Amanda and Bobbi.   Amanda is adorable! shes funny and cute and no guy can resist that. bobbi's lots of fun too and shes a good advice-giver. anyway, the movie was really good and outside the theater we saw Jake Scruggs, Emily Hasty and CHRIS HASTINGS. coincidence or what! oo i really liked that guy from the movie and i thought he was gay the whooole time.. but then he asked that girl to marry him and it was like "bummer..."  that night all i could talk or even think about was chris. i was talking to gina and she IMed me dominic's screenname. and he wa son. so we talked for 2 hours and somehow chris left my mind. i didnt even think about him again until mid august. dominic was nice and really sweet... it didnt take long for me to fall for him. but i fall for everyone so thats not saying much.  on the 8th we were going out and we talked on the phone for 6 and a half hours! my all time record.. at least until november. :-D. and by the 13th we had our first date. we saw pirates of the carribean and yeah.. it was fun.. :-D! overall dominic's a great guy.. or at least he was at first. but then things started getting shitty and yeah. it ended. THAT COOLEST THING is that ym's horoscope guide said that i would fall for a pisces and it said the 8th and 13th were lucky days, but the 22nd was a bad one. and i broke up with him on the 22nd. freaky.  the week of my birthday was crazy. i went shopping a lot. jocelyn and i got kicked outta abercrombie for modelling and hara fell in love with cheyenne. kathleen and kalie and i had a lotta fun trying clothes on at anchor blue  OH! Kathleen! she's bundles of fun, and she was my best friend last year. for her b-day i got her 20o bucks worth of stuff including DVDs, CDs and 100 balloons!  ellen got me a shirt from American Eagle and i PROMISED to wear it the first day of school. but before that i wore it on my brithday when nathalie and I saw how to deal. that was such a good movie. outside the theater we saw this old guy selling brownies and we said there was prolly pot in them. lol.  july was an awesome month, and the perfect end to the perfect story was my brand new cell phone. woot woot.  yup yup ~Brandon
