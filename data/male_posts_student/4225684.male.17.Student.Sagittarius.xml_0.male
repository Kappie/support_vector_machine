Or am i just dreaming, one day waking up with another totally different personality as a totally different person, with a totally different life. Thoughts of such run through my head.       My existence. As i continue to journey through my life, i lose more and more of my consciousness, and i begin to realise... just how much of this is real.. What if this whole thing called my life was just a dream where i would wake up and never remember.      Im a christian and i believe that when i pass away, i will go on to be with God in heaven for eternity. But it doesnt stop thoughts from creeping into my mind. Thoughts of, what is eternity? Can there really be a forever? These short 75 years of an average human life if im even blessed with, what are they. The lives which we pass, are they just a repetition with our existences reliving it everytime we pass on, or is it forever etched in time once its passed, never to come back.      What is the Meaning of this all... What is the purpose... This moment im spending right now to type this all out... It will be passed, never again returned.. That much of a value i cannot describe, that i wish to savour whole heartedly, yet cannot...      How i wish, things were just so simple but they arent.....      "Time passes me by as i sit and listen,   cries of folly, shouts of joy, happiness in abundance.   time it seems, we just have so much to spare,   what we don't realize is that time is not so keen to share.   what's passed, done and finished is over,   we will not be able to go back and start all over....."
