Large corpora of text have been mined for finding patterns and relationships between discourse segments.  Now, there has not been too much work on mining video databases for finding such patterns. One of the main hindrances in undertaking such a task, is that there are no strict linguistics rules that could be applied to sequences of shots and frames. But movies are created from scripts, and scripts are written in natural language.   I propose a hybrid model for analysing films.
