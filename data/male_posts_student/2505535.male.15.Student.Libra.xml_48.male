All the bands were pretty damn poor, Anna's band seemed very dressed up, and they had no drummer, and had had only one practice, and their bassist had dropped out to, so the had just found another one very recently. But they weren't as poor as the 13 year old emo kids doing Staind covers, sorry, there's just something about young emo kids being emotional with guitars that gets to me. Also playing "Solid Air" - the band Mark Doerr (son of my History teacher - I got an A in hist this year, rawk) is in, which we all agreed were a bit boring, so I got onion rings over the road. But I guess I had fun anyway, but I left early at around the time Alice left cos I couldn't be arsed with staying and seeing the end of the metal band "I EN-SLAVE YOU!! YOU EN-SLAVE ME!!!"  I've got almost all my school end of year exam results back, only the French writing and Music, cos my music teacher is incompetant and has been away all week, well, actually she turned up both days *just* after our lessons.. grur..  I'm not gunna bore you with my actual results for each subject, but four As, four Cs, and 2 Bs, which was good, seeing as 3 of my Cs were in the sciences which I really don't care about. Supposedly we're supposed to go up 2 grades from those to our actual GCSEs. More people than usual are failing this year, and my  urlLink history results  are on the school site for some reason.  Now I'm going to take over Japan in  urlLink "Shogun: Total War, Warlords Edition"   Rawk.
