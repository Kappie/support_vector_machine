So much going on, and Im trying to be strong.  Really.  But its hard.  And I dont really know how all this turmoil is going to end, so Im in a constant state of emptiness and worry.  I just have to be ok for a little while longer...  Im very surprised I got this far.  Hell, I didnt think I could do it.  But I did.  And I guess that shows just how I feel.  All I can offer really.  Fate sucks.  John says that the nature of life is not looking at the good and bad things, rather it is the outcome of the choices that we make.  I think that logic has one flaw.  We cant control the choices that other people make.  So right now, Im just waiting on a single choice.  And that choice isnt mine.  Funny how life works, huh?  I guess Im off to take the CNA test I didnt study for, the microbio quiz I didnt study for, and the nutrition test I didnt study for.  If I just live past this day, it will be a miracle.
