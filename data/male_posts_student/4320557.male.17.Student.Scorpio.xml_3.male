He's bringing the fridge and his laptop, and of course, his car... because he knows all the hot places around Milwaukee and will definately need it.... you know, since public transportation and a U-pass will not suffice.  Gonna be rough with only one loft though, maybe i'll have to do some convincin'... we'll see how things work out.
