You know what that means right?? I have to learn RSS and now XML!!! Arrggghhhhh!!!!!    I wish I had some sort of matter de-materializer combobulator thingy. That would make the day go by smoother. I would jsut zap the idiots that are just plain weird.    Where is the truth in the world? I am wondering what the heck am I breaking my back for? The lottery seems like such a sweet dream right now. Things would be different. I would live alone in a house. Well it would look like a house but it would be more like a fortress! State-of-the-art everything! Lets just say the house would talk to me. I know how to do that too. It would take a few really good computers and some custom software. I would be like,"house, what is on TV or order me a pizza online". It seems stupid or not possible, but it is and I will do that my house if I win the lottery!!!!
