After babysitting I finished my homework, one assignment was to read the newspaper, that was torture, especially reading about the people who died, that was just horrible...you know the "oBITCHaries" or whatever. Then I had to go the orthodontist where I found out my braces are coming off the 24th!(=...of November.)= Eh, just a month away. Jesus I can't wait to see Matrix Revolutions, it's gonna be grand, there's one part where some city gets engulfed in a huge waterful explosion nuclear bomb thing. It's beautiful. Chinese food for dinner, that was good stuff, then I drummed for a few hours, now I'm here...now I'm here, look around around around around...you don't see you don't see, now im here, now im there. Great song. Queen. Ok the new homestar malloween isn't working on my computer. That's upsetting. I listened to a lot of Rush today. That's basically it, the game was rained out. Bye.
