Just keep on reading this damn blog even if i turn out to be abusive coz i've inherited this quality from my new school only recently, and it's tuff resistin it. I'm kumpletely outta sorts since I almost flunk'd in my exams... Got scolding from dad.. Life's playin dirty wit me . It basically sucks !! The idea of shoppin n dinin out wit my family this weekend ....seems no better than a joke.  nuke that ; Actually, wassup wit da world ...! Well, olympics 2004 is wat evryone's talking about. it's everywhere. Frankly, I have no interest in 'em and to me it's all crap. Its competitions n all are perfect yawners ! It's enuff denouncing and criticizing the world....I better look out for something else to fade my anger out !
