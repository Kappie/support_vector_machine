I believe when you die you die. Simple as that. People will say "but you have to believe in something otherwise life isn't really worth living" but it is what I believe because I feel you can't just believe in anything purely on blind faith. Like for say in a court of law you have to prove an incident happened within all reasonable doubt, and that in my opinion is exactly what you should apply for religion as well.  There hasn't (beside a few debatable cult religious books which attracted many followers, due to the fairy tale and "overly accurate" story lines of miracles and coincidences which according to them couldn't have happened without God's "divine intervention" e.g. the Koran and bible) ever been any conclusive evidence for God's existence, despite many fair and well put arguments i.e. ontological and teleological.  I don't think I've got the time to go into the suffering issue, however you must admit it's almost a solid and firm argument against the Deity (God).  So I might as well leave you with a question - if we found intelligent life on another planet (which is probably likely one day considering how absolutely huge the Universe is) - what would you religious believers think then?  xBuBzx
