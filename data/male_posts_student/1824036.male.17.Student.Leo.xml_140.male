Jadie isn't half bad ... actually she is pretty good for only golfing a little.  After golfing for a couple hours we went back to her house and ate a little...then went back to my house and hit golf balls into the field. It was great. I am an animal :)....I love to hit balls into fields when nobody is looking and all that jazz...then I can swing as hard as I want :)  As for a title now...I dont know if we have one...
