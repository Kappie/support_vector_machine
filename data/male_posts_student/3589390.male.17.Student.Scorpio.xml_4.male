Kevin Spacey is by far the best actor ever, and if you don't agree, you're wrong...plain and simple. :)  After watching K-PAX I went to my baseball game and well..there were 13 of us there. THIRTEEN. That means...PEOPLE SIT OUT. Now see, I'm all for having enough people on a team, not to screw people over who really do want to play, but after all is said and done, we have a team of sixteen people. SIXTEEN. Luckily some obviously didn't show up tonight, but that's beside the point. Recently my imbecile of a coach decided to "recruit" two new kids...half-way through the season. What a joke...I mean, they're good ball players, but that just means more people have to sit out..So anyways, today I led off, centerfield, first to bat..grounded out, after I accidentally stumbled out of the batter's box..egh. Then next time I got up, I hit a line drive right at the pitcher. Shucks. Well, my batting wasn't very good so now a look at my fielding..first inning a kid hits a ball to right field, I'm running assuming I'm going to back the right fielder up because, he's partly incompetent...but he decides to tell me to get it, so here I am, completely in right field, having to slide to make a catch...well I miss it, and I get chewed out for it. Whatever. Anyways, before I was taken out, coach put me in right field for one inning, because one of the new kids "doesn't play" right field. What a joke! He's been here 2 games and he's getting his preference heard over someone who's been there for 3 years? My coach is an idiot..but I go out to right field and make 2 out of the 3 outs, some nice popup catches...but he still takes me out.  ANYWAYS...later in the game while I was on the bench, the other new kid says something along the lines of, that if you're up to bat and have the bat over the plate showing a bunt, and you don't pull back, it's automatically a strike. I told him that he was wrong, and that you're allowed to have your bat over the plate and if it's a bad pitch, it's still called a ball because to be considered a bunt, you have to "go for" the ball. He said he was 100% sure he was right and even said he'd be willing to put money on it. He then proceded to call me stupid for thinking otherwise. Well, I was bored a few minutes ago and looked it up online. Guess who was right? Me.  Whatever..then I just got done watching Memento again..good movie.  uh..I'm tired.    eeefkq2opw3utpq2
