Right after I read it, I was all, "Damn that would have been sweet if I was there because I would have taken the AR-15 or shotgun out of the car and then I would have been running around Carol Stream with either an assault rifle or a shotgun, either of which would remind me of my favourite TV character, Jack Bauer a.k.a. Kiefer Sutherland of 24.    While you nancy boys have been gardening, I have been doing man's work and getting frames, mattes, and posters.  Yes, it's true, I am a decorating genius.  Bagel, I am also tuned in to what is totally hot right now in Philly suburban style, so if you need me to decorate your apt., you know, the one in the suburbs of Philly, just let me know.  Today I went to the custom framing shop D'etre (shout out to Chairman and speaking French) and bought a frame for a poster I have that is 40"x55" a.k.a. fucking huge.  I had to buy plexiglass (looks real though) for that shit, because regular glass would have weighed almost as much as whitey when he was on his fat... I mean "muscle" diet, a.k.a. 15-18 eggs a day.  Later,  Joel a.k.a. the AK-man a.k.a. "Shoeshine McGillicutty, the Shoeshinin' Man"  P.S.  Speed metal sucks.
