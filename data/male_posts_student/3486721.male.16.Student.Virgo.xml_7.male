Oh well, hopefully me and the others still end up going to go find some people to chill with and drink beer. Niklas's dad bought fucking 30 crates of beer when he was in Holland and he is letting us have 5!  So that is 5 x 20 = 100 cans to drink!  Tonight should be great, if we till end up going.  Lets just hope the weather gets better!
