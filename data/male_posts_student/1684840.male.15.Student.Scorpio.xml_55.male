I caught a terrible disease called Blogus Preventus (that's latin, honest!) and whenever I tried to update my blog it teased me and it wouldnt let me update :'(  Hehe only joking.  I'm about to go off to bed now after a lazy Sunday, which felt like a typical Sunday now that I'm back at school.  The feeling of 'School Tomorrow' is floating around after a measly two days off.  I have a bad chest and I feel really hot... again.  I'm off.  I better get to bed now or I'll feel really rubbish in the morning.  Night...
