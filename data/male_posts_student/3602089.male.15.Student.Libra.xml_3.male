I got up approx. at 10:25am and started taping Ronald Reagen's funeral for my mom at 10:37am...it had started at 10am.  I got online to see if my friend in Niedersachsen (Dissen, to be specific), Germany, was on or Курочкино Надежда Сергеевна, my friend in St. Petersburg, Russia.  Neither were on but I chatted with my mom who was at work at the courthouse.  I finished watching the commentary version of "The Craft" on DVD, which is one of my favorite movies of all time!  I tried renaming and reorganizing my mp3s that i had to transfer from my iPod to my new computer hardrive which will be a strenuous task, seeing as how the names somehow change in the transfer process... I really wish there were a Starbucks within at least 30 minutes of here.  There are three in one city an hour from here which is not fair.  The one-pound-burrito restaurant, Chipotle: there is not one in the whole grand state of Pennsylvania.  I had one while in Baltimore on a field trip and it was extremely tasty.  OH DAMN!  I forgot that the stand up comedians on on tonight!...hmm...I hope I'm not missing any good ones!...My condolences go out to Nancy and the rest of the Reagan family...he truly was a compassionate human being.
