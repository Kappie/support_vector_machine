The design argument basically states that there is a omni-(scient, potent, present et cetra et cetra) God who created this whole Earth. Looking around, no, not everything biologically on this Earth is perfect. Look at the human eye for example. It is built upside down. With the light we recieve having to go through the fluids, cells, etcetra. And this cells and fluids are necessary for the eye to stay "alive". But the light sensitive rods are at the end of this fluids, cells et cetra. And all this fluids, cells somehow block the pathway of the light to reach these light-sensitive rods which translated the light into neural impulses for the brain to translate into images. So why aren't the light sensitive rods built nearest to the outer part of the eye?? This showcases imperfect design as well as many other examples.  But the validity of the design argument is still very difficult to refute, the calculated 10^120 chance in which the universe would come about as a strong testement to this. So what is my hypothesis?? EVOLUTION EXISTED AND IT IS CREATED BY GOD. That is my hypothesis. The 6 day period of genesis may not be 6 24 hour periods. But as some "old earth" theorists and many geologists which have affirmed this. The 6 "day" period may be close to 6 billion years. When Genesis chapter 1 states that God created the "winged creatures" and "fishes in the sea". There is a possibility that these "winged creatures" may not be the cute little birdies u see outside ur window. It may be the archeopteryx, or dinosaur birds, which evolved into cute little birdies u see today. And the "beasts on the Earth" may well be T-rexes which evolve. I don't believe that Dinosaurs died out, I believed that they evolved. Yeah through natural selection, some died out........and some evolved.   I believe that geological evidence is hard to deny and its pretty hard to refute the "old earth" theory. I believe that both creationism and evolution have both their truths and fallacies. Its "Abrupt appearance" v.s "Gradual appearance". I believe that God set the first seeds of evolution in motion, and from there he orchestrated it, God created the railway for the train of evolution to move on. What is the answer for this seemingly "imperfect" design of the human eye as well as many others?? Imo, it is simply one word, INTELLIGENCE. Humans are not the only race which have such intellectual capability. Who knows? Maybe some race in the prehistoric era had a significant intellectual level, maybe not as advanced as us. And like how we're messing up our Earth with pollution and all.  From here, this somehow warps the railway track a little. And cause a little "imperfection" in this seemingly perfect design of evolution from God. I'll maybe elaborate on this sometime later........when I've done more questioning, thinking and research
