Great, great movie....I have been reading a few reviews from the usually reliable  urlLink Internet Movie Database  absolutely skewering the movie but I found it to be highly entertaining and a good diversion from the norm....It looked to me like the actors were enjoying themselves and therefore giving their best effort....oh well....I guess that's why I'm not a paid movie critic (yet)....  In other news I feel a little less embarrassed and whatever about earlier....I mean a scene was made and I felt a little isolated but it wasn't the horrible ordeal I made it out to be....I was with beautiful ladies after all....  Anyway I think I'm going to pull the all-nighter....on the agenda tonight....Godfather Part III, Halloween, and Reservoir Dogs....time to pop the popcorn....
