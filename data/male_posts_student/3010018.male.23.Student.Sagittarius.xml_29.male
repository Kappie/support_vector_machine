I know better than anyone else that the things that hurt me, the things that have hurt me in my life pale in comparison to what some have gone through. I know that in the grand scheme of things my pain doesnt really mean much because they are things that I should get over. They are things that I should be able to get past but i cant. These things torment me and disturb my every waking moment. And even in my sleep, as rare as it is, these things torture me. I do not see logic, reason or the silver lining behind all of this. I see only pain. I know its petty, i know its not as bad as i make it seem. But i cant help how i feel.  I would love to be able to say that I am happy with the way my life is and that i find some contentment in the things around me. But i find nothing like that, i find only regret and sorrow, anger and sadness, the wish to go back to do it over again.
