In the other news, I just found the homepage for the English ice hockey people...holy macrap. I'm pretty sure I could do better than that in my sleep. And I'm not just saying that. They really need some financial help. And probably mental help. Basingstoke near the top of  any  league is unholy.   GO DEVILS!
