I haven't yet heard about the guide job but I'm still as pessimistic as before about that.  I might get a job at the countries biggest insurance company or Iceland's BBC but that's not really interesting except for the fact that I'm really nervous.  Last Monday we had first (of two exams) and the next one is on the 20th of this month so we rented a house in the country and got wasted for two days. It was fairly interesting though I did behave unlike last year when I made a big scandal (not to be published anywhere).  The second day I was more drunk but still didn't do anything terrible.  My friend was another one of those houses like an hour away probable more drunk than I was (it's possible) and decided he wanted to pay me a visit, we'll something like 15-20 people came out and stopped him.  Thank god!!!!  Ok I have to ask about few things here since English isn't my first language and there are just quite a few things in Tims post that aren't adding up in my book.  What does "lil' hunk o' tin" mean (and pretty much all the sentence before that one too).... Second Bob who?... Prince of Tides ... Yes Barbara Str%$# is my all time favoractressrice so I wouldn't stop talking about her so I won't begin. ..  I would like to tell you about the pretty much only thing that happens in this city but Svana says that I'm sad if I do so.  Well I can't think of anything useless to say so I guess I have to go back to study for my Finance II exam.  Later, Úlli
