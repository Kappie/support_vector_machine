The lady got soo pissed. She got off at the following exit, after honking her horn and giving us the finger. I was laughing so hard.  The weekend was fairly uneventful... i learned that i need to keep my mouth shut once in a while (when under the influence or not). Im really tired of school and i dont want to go anymore, lacrosse is beginning to become a drag, especially since we aint winning like we used to. Oh well, maybe some muse will come and inspire me that there is a reason to get up in the morning.   farewell Darin
