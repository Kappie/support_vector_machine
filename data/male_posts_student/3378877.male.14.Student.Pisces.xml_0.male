They played pipes and trashcans and stuff! It was so fun, and then at the end of the show they made it like a little rave party! it was awesome [Flashing lights, trance music, black light, streamers!]. That was my favorite part!  * The rest of the trip was fun, it was mostly museums and stuff but i liked it.   * Then we went shopping on Michigan Avenue! That was my second favorite part! We only had a half an hour though! So my group just went to Urban Outfitters! I love that store [there were a lot of gay guys in that store :)] [HAHA]   * OH YEAH! WE SAW A GIRL THAT WAS ON THE SHOW 'MADE'! IT WAS SO AWESOME!  * lol well that was my trip! I will have pics later to show you!  * kd
