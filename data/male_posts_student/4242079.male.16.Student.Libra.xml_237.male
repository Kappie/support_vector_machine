Well, I don't really have anything much to say, so I'll just give you the point form...  -Last night, went to Kylies. -Phaedra and Holly were there. -It was a good ol' time. -Woke up to one of my "half-awake-hallucinations-about-stupid-things". There hallucinations are caused by lack of sleep, but are multiplied by the consumption of alcohol. They often revolve around work, as well. This time, I thought Kylie was trying to sell me a digital camera. Wonder if I said anything, I usually talk when these things are going through my mind. -Dog chewed holes in my socks. Place blame on Phaedra for stealing my socks.
