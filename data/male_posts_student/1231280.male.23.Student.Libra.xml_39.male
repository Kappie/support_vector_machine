My advisor has not replied to me in a week and I need to know what kind of classes I need to take for the summer - SO - I'm going to hike up to campus and find out what the fuck I need to do. Then, I'm going downtown and getting me a copy of Superman #204. Then, I'm going home. Anyways, have a nice day! urlLink
