I know I failed a quiz in CL but I don't want my parents to be aware that my grades are slipping these past few weeks. The reasons is because I don't want my parents to take away the perks that I have during weekdays like getting to watch TV. Recently, my mind is on guitar tabs and and a game called Dynasty Tactics 2 that I can't stop playing on weekends. I just can't focus when it comes to studying. Then if I get bored of studying, I get my guitar and play for at least 30 minutes. Then I go back to studying. But after a few minutes, by hands are itching to play the guitar. Then I just forget about studying and just continue playing until I fall asleep. So until I get some control on this, I don't guarantee an improvement on my grades.  I have this song stuck in my head right now. It's called "I Hate to Say I Told You So" by The Hives. It's not the lyrics, it's not the vocals... it's the tune. Somehow, I just find it so great and cool. I found the tabs of the song last week then I saw that it was just 4 power chords repeated over and over. But it wasn't bad, the simplicity of it made me realize that if I were to compose some tunes, it doesn't have to be something like "Sweet Child of Mine" or something by Jimi Hendrix, even the simplest tunes can come out very beautiful when it comes to rock.   That's it for my third post. Thanks to for reading(whoever is reading).
