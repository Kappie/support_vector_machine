Well today i had a lot of fun anyways, last day before school starts.  It started with the normal waking up and going to church in the morning..........then after that i went to eat with Melinda and her mom.  We went to Olive Garden, it was so good, then after we ate we went shopping..........i really hate shopping, but the company made up for it.  After that i came home and finished summer reading and then went back to church and then came home and thats about it.
