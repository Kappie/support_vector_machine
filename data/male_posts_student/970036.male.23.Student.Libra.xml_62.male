I know, I know, you might be shocked to hear this as well, but the product I've seen advertised in no way lived up to my expectations.   It’s new. It’s hot. It’s spicy. It’s something different from Dairy Queen®.  It’s the FLAMETHROWER™ Burger on the Dairy Queen menu just in time for National Hamburger Month in May. The FlameThrower™ is made with two all-beef patties, whole leaf lettuce and sliced tomato, and topped with zesty Jalapeño bacon, spicy Pepper Jack cheese and tangy Tabasco Chipotle mayonnaise.   Though still a tasty burger,  by no means  should  Tabasco  be considered a flavouring of cataclysmic consequences. Are there really people out there who recoil at the extremeness of zesty Jalapeño bacon? And while we're at it, just what the fuck is "zesty" supposed to mean? It's kinda like "tangy," in that neither of the words means a damn thing. Do you know the difference between zesty and tangy? If I put pepper on a banana, does that make it  zesty !? They're both fabrications of the food in dustry to facilitate selling mediocre products with exciting descriptions.  However, the bottom line is that I  did not  whimper in fear at the burger,  did not  torch my surroundings with an ultra cool napalm breath, and certainly  did not  think that I  finally  found a restaurant item which lived up to the claim of being insanely hot.
