I learned how to cut the vegetables their way, which is a good way.  About a half hour later I was making pizzas for the rest of the evening with Arturo.(chef who makes the pizza as well as entrees)  Making the pizza is a very easy task which requires little to no brainpower at all.  Really, I learned a lot and I think this is a great job.  Upon finishing work I walked to Borders and bought Trigun Maximum volume 1.  For over a year I've been waiting for it to come out.  I bought a poster of it at Anime Central last year and have been waiting for its arrival since then.  Luckily my local Borders finally restocked their manga section and actually organized everything.  This made me one happy camper.  I'ma play some text twist before going to sleep.  It's almost 4 in the morn, but I'm not tired at all.  Current Music: Volta Do Mar - breaking ribs for tom thayer
