She says she doesn't want to talk about the past, and really, neither do I. It will always be there, and I don't want to forget it. I know it's going to come up sometimes, but...Somethings are better left unsaid. Or unthought.  And so now, I'm at work. I need to get someone to watch the store while I go and buy me some lunch, because I'm stuck here all by my lonesome.  I've been trying to be happy the last few days. My problems seem so small and trivial when I look at the lives of other people. Like Heather, or my cousin Chris. No, I should be happy that I had the opportunity to be hurt.
