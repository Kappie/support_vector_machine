If a question is a little too much, please put "N/A". I would also prefer it to be put under anonymous (that way things will not spread around). The only way I will accept a name, is if I know who you are and I know you will not be offended. Thank you ^_^  (I will try and update this as I come up with questions... I will also substitute words but hopefully you will get the gist of what is being asked, and I do not ask anything that I myself have not answered).  1) If you could be any 4 people from Final Fantasy 7 though 10, who would you be based on you personality? (two have to be male, two have to be female).  2) If you could have a threesome with any two people (may be from anime, actor, videogame, ect., ect.) and one has to be male and one has to be female, who would they be? (And invisible people DO NOT COUNT!)  3) If you could be a combination of any two villains (with the exception of Sephiroth), what two people would you be?  4) What is the weirdest thing you have ever thought of (if you do) when you take care of yourself?  5) what is your religouse belief?   6) What is your favorite music band?
