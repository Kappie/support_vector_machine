Some cultures would call me a Shaman - but before anyone asks I know next to nothing of shamanism.  I have taught a small handful the arts of magic.  My background is in the fields of philosophy and library science.  I grew up without the benefit of anyone around me knowing magic, or knowing what I was going through.  The first time I met anyone who I could compare ideas to was about five years before writing this page.  The significance of the name 'witch-hunter reborn' is that I am the reincarnation of the idiot who first started the witch hunts - now karma has caught up.   WHAT IS MAGIC?  Magic is a series of techniques which can be grouped together with the phrase "live in the real world buddy".    The three main techniques are termed "prayer, protection, meditation".  All three are important for the safe practice of magic.  ____________________________________________________________________________________  As a point of humour, I ran a spellcheck on this page before posting it (the spellcheck which came with the blog-maker), the spellcheck did not like the word 'blog'
