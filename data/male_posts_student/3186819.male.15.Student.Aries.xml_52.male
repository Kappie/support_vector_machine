There must be a better way to evaluate knowledge other than examinations! What about people who stress out about tests! There is someone in my family living class who last year vomitted all morning from stress for exams! They are emotionally and (due to lack of sleep) physically taxing on the body! Sure my family living """"exam"""" is open book, but what about my french exam (even though my teacher said if any one of us fails the exam we still pass the course). There really is no point to final examinations and evaluations or even cumulative education. After studying hard for the exams one of the biggest things we want is to lose the knowledge! Good luck to you all with exams, and have fun!
