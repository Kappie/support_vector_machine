All and all this was a pretty sad year. A lot has happened over the course of one year, and i can tell you one thing, I’m not me anymore. Basic wrap-up of this year in chronological order... that i can remember, I’m a Dory.  -Begging of year, Happy -things got better, became friends with some people, Samm, Tricia, Amanda, Tory, Britney, sally, some others, my brain is boggled and I forget things a lot so don't worry if i forget people. -Middle of year, so-so (Dory: cant complain) -somewhere in the middle of the year friends were betrayed by me, lost a few, went into depression, screwed up life, forced myself to look back at life and wonder what i was doing for years and years to others and understood why some hate me. Became better, was ok with it for a while, months later sank into a deeper depression. Lunch was becoming suffocating with all those people who see me and who I’ve made lives hell for and others that were so close to me and now who have lost interest in each other. Watched the administration become more evil and force the best teachers we had to leave, and who will undoubtedly hire only teachers that they like. -End of the Year, Pain. Guilt. Shame. Anger. Alone. -Had the ending conversation, heard the door of friendship close and slam in my face, lost a part of my life that will never grow back. Will never be used, will never be open, will never be carefree, completely happy, pure. Again.  I will never go through this life again. I changed.
