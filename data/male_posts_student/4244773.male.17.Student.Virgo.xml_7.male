They made their unbeaten record to 41 matches by thrashing Everton 1-4 away, But they still need 2 matches unbeaten to break Nottingham Forest's record of 43 matches. This season it's the title show down between Arsenal and Chelsea!! Chelsea have a big chance of winning the title this season. MU ? Sorry MU but you are just not good enough..... maybe 3rd or 4th placing would suit you best. I hope Liverpool, Newcastle, Arsenal and Chelsea will kick MU's butt this season. Anyway great timing for the season.... with the Olympics in Athens starting just few days before EPL, it'll stop our boredom. Now i'll be waiting for the start of Serie A and the Spanish La Liga.
