The team to make the most sentences with the cards wins. Mike's sentence was "The cats rode the spiders to fluffy." She accepts. Mine is "Two eggs of Talula quickly rode a shoe." She doesn't accept. Both of them are gramatically correct. Neither make sense in real life but that's not the point. She didn't give my sentence any points so I started to object her. And I kept nagging her to give me an answer to why mine was wrong. By the way I asked another English teacher if it was gramatically correct and it was. So my teacher just said drop it and wouldn't give me an answer so I said I'm right. Then she said everyone sit down I have to check these sentences. I sat down, turned around and starting talking to Bono and she yells at me saying DID I SAY YOU COULD TALK? WTF?! She never said I couldn't talk. That's not the end of it though, listen to this. She then goes just shut up. So it's all quiet, some people are talking but not out loud (either was I to Bono) and I call out to her, "Ms. Baione, who's Edmund Harrison?" (which I saw on the board) and she says "THAT'S IT! AFTER SCHOOL DETENTION MONDAY!" Two words. Bull. Shit. I'll talk her out of it and if she doesn't accept I'm going to the office to complain. There's no fucking way I can get in trouble for asking a teacher that question. There's no way I'm going to after school detention on Monday, she better either forget about it or change it to lunch detention, fucking dike. Then after school, I'm walking around and I see Schreck and Matt Mcdonough so I bang 4 times against the locker (Slayer song that grabs Schreck's attention) and then some teacher comes out and starts bitching to me. It's after school, who the fuck cares, is anyone working hard enough that they can't hear a couple of bangs on the lockers? Unless their in nerd club for after school where you do school work for fun after school which I don't think even exists. So this lady asks me what grade I'm in...what the fuck does that matter? Fucking retard teacher I wanted to spit on her. The lady teachers are just bitching. I fucking hate the school. Except Mr. Ferrante, he's god. But besides for him school blows. In a couple of weeks it'll all be done. I can't believe it. Summer is here. In a week school is over and testing begins which is no problem. The tests this year I can care less about. I don't care much about my grades anymore. Studying and trying hard isn't worth it, at least it's not for me. I enjoy drumming, and doing stuff with friends free from labor. Maybe I should drop out of school. Who knows, we'll see...maybe I won't even go to college. My dad didn't, but today without college, you can't get anything, this world sucks. School sucks. Why should teachers tell us what to do, it's not in their control, we're there to succeed to make livings, not to be repremanded, those bitches. Eh, why am I bitching, it'll be over soon and for 2 months the dreams I have at night about schools blowing up won't occur anymore because school won't be in my head. Freedom is the summer. Summer is freedom. Jesus I'm talking alot about nothing, so I'm just gonna cut down what I did today. Why do I always give these lectures in my journal, I'm supposed to explain what happens in my life, not what I hate. Hmmm...well it helps release my inner anger. Anyways, I'm cutting it down. Kaiser and I hung out today. Went to Quiznos to see Paul. Bumped into Eric, Luis and other people...that's all. "Bai."
