Now I'm not talking about those people in High School that everyone wanted to impress and hope that THEY remember you.  No, I mean FORGOTTEN.  Someone you love or someone who loves you just drifts away because they forget all about you.  It's kind of a passive abandonment... they don't actively try to forget about you, it just happens.  Why would someone forget about someone else?  One of the simplest answers is that one person simply ceases to be important to another.
