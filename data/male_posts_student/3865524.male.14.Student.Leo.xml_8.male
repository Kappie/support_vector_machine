Well, i was SUPPOSED to go fishing tommorow with my uncle dave(not my real uncle, i just call him that, same with aunty sue) and This guy named goodlad(dave), but they got drunk and my mom said no. Well that stinks cause i wanted to go fishing!!!! but, we cant all win. Anyway, uncle dave is drunk, and aunty sue was kinda worried about him getting angry or something, so she called my mom and she(my mom) went up there. Now im all alone in the house, and its raining and thundering(and lighting) outside, which really sucks. Wait...yeh, ok. But i think im gonna go mess on the net some more then go watch Braveheart, so thanks for readin my nightly rant, and i'll see ya in the morning!
