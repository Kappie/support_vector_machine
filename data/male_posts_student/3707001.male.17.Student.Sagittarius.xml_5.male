"And I Wish God never gave the men power  To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, And I (I wish)  Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous,  When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, But uh  We will never break, don't underestimate, we shall motivate,  And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.  Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day,  The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.  Sit at the light so long,  And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong,  So when right go wrong,  Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on!!!  Let's HOPE!  Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic,  I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it,  We can make it always so optimistic,  If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it,  I pray for justice when we go to court,  Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war,  Why can't we kick it and just get em on,  And in the famous words of Mr. King 'Why can't we all just get along',  Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I  Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I  Wish everybody would just stop and freeze,  And ask way are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies,  You can be wrong if it's you doubting,  With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains,  And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt,  Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!  And let's HOPE    [CHORUS] Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,  Take this music and use it  Let it take you away,  And be hopeful (hopeful) and He'll make a way  I know it ain't easy but that's okay.  Let's be hopeful!"    Heres the shortened lyrics of my fav song to sing in the shower: I swear - All4One I'd like to dedicate this to that special girl who im APPARENTLY taking to her prom... :S (they say the chorus like 5 times, one at beginning, between the 2 verses and like 2 at the end so i put it once :D)   "I see the questions in your eyes I know what's waiting on your mind You can be sure i know my part 'cause i stand beside you through the years You'll only cry those happy tears and though i make mistakes i'll never break your heart  I'll give you every thing i can I'll build your dreams with these two hands We'll hang some memories on the wall And when (and when) just the two of us are there You won't have to ask if i still care 'cause as the time changes the page My love won't ever age at all  [Chorus] And i swear by the moon And the stars in the sky i'll be there I swear like the shadow that's by your side I'll be there for better or worse till death do us part I'll love you with every beat of my heart This i swear"   Wow, it's only be a week since i started this thing and im already falling behind!! Well, it's been a few days since u last heard from me, so heres what u missed:  Sunday Missed Church :( (its not my fault really)... Well, i woke up turned on the comp, played some sc... the rest is kinda fuzzy.  I also promised a very special girl that i'd take her to her prom as a last resort, and she said that i was her first and last resort... YEA RITE!!! i can picture the last part of it but the first... naw... Also, i spent a hectic nite sorting out my timetable, its not like high school where they do everything for u, u have to first decide what u wanna do in University, look at the requirements for that program, make sure u take all the prerequistes for the later courses, and sort out when u wanna take what... THEN after that u have to check the timetable to see when the different lectures and tutorials for each course is going on, and then pick the rite ones so that nothing conflicts... whew, it was WILD!! after an hour i got the fall session done, but the winter never seemed to work, i tried changing this lecture that practical... it didnt work!!! I thought i had to drop a course but then a divine ray of light enlightened me and it was all so clear ^.^  Monday: I woke up, played some sc, and decided to go wit a friend to Fairview Mall to run some MvC2 (Marvel vs. Capcom 2) the BEST FIGHTING GAME EVER!!! Wow, it seemed like the longest bus ride ever... what seemed like an eternity seemed to only take 50 mins... lol, i struggled when i got up to tell my friend who took the bus almost everyday to fairview to get off on front of the mall, only to find out that the 85 stops INSIDE the mall at Don Mills Station, hahaha, every1 was looking at me funny, now i know why... Well when we got there, we seen some nice sales going on at Champs, Athletes World and Foot Locker, everything 70% off!!! If i had money i woulda bought something, but i didnt.  LOL, im $500+ in debt rite now, dont worry why :P!  Anyways, we finally reached the arcade at the other end of the mall and seen the the competition was already there.  When we walked in, there was a lil kid who was using some cheap characters which are looked down upon in the arcades, and an azn guy using reg characters.  After the azn won, i put in my money and died in like 30 secs!! LOL, i even accidently picked a cheap character and still got owned!! Well, after me the guy got to i think 9 wins total before my friend finally beat him and left.  Then i put my money in and owned my friend a few times, after we realised that the side my friend won on is kinda broken... the low block (which is key) wasnt working too well.  Anyways, i beat the lil kid and my friend a few times, then i gave my friend $.50 and let him beat me cuz i wanted to see him do something which he never did >. On the bus ride home my friend invited me to run some more MvC2 at his house... we were both hooked so i said yes.  On the way i bought some fattening goodness at the local MickeyD's and ate it at his house.  We got there at about 7-7:30... and we played till past 11!!!! But then my mom called and was pissed cuz it was "late" so i had to go home :(  Today: Woke up, sc/msn, some ppl came and interrupted my fun to test the fire alarms :@ who needs fire alarms anyways??!! lol, jks.  I made plans wit a friend to go to open gym at my FORMER high school (man it feels good to say that) but then realised that it's closed and decided to play ball on turf.  When stepped on the court there were like 5 kids like hitting pine cones wit a baseball bat :|, not cool, i hoped there would be some competition but there wasn't, so i started working on my game: pull-up jumpers, post game, some left-handed layups.  It was mostly pull-ups cuz thats my weakness :(.  Got home, more msn, shower and here i am... Man im hungry but my mom left again, theres leftover from lunch but... meh...  PS. Matt, we gotta chill sometime, i'd email u or comment ur log but i cant :( call/email me sometime...
