Furthermore you are leaving soon... We were already adapted to your teaching, jokes and etc. And now sep you flying off... What can we say??? Good for you! Study hard and play hard too! All the best... Seriously, i felt guilty and also sad... It's because you are leaving soon and we made you cried more then twice and i believed that it must be hard to deal with angeline... Sorry... Really... Hmm... Rest assured... I will definately remember your birthday! Haha... It's really nice of you to say that you always look forward for our class every Wednesday despite being a busy... I believed it must be our craziness that really makes you enjoy that lesson... Well, you will be leaving Singapore soon.. A month or so... Meaning we onli left with not more than five lessons to go... I believed you and the rest of us will definately cherished the time left...  Hmm... What happen this morning??? Let me see... Oh Well... Hmm... Got back Chemistry results... Hmm... To some it may be good... But to me, it's still lower than my expectations... Yea... Perhaps i didn't really study hard... Let's hope that this Saturday's Chemistry i will do well...   Oh yes... The Mathematics Quiz was tough!!! Oh man!!! What really makes me turn red with fury was that Mr Ang said that he can just don give us quiz as he also needs to spen alot of times preparing and marking it... Hello??? That's what you are supposed to do what... You chose to be a teacher... We didn't force you!!! Being a teacher Must have patience... But you don't! When being asked to explain the question second time, you started to get irritated!!! What's this??? Don't you know that different people have different speed of absorbing things into their brains??? Since you choose to take up this job, you should endure with us! Whatever!!!  So tired... Just reach home... Going to bath soon... Good night! Take care!!!
