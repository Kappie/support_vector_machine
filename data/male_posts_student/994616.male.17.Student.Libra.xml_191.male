He seemed entirely reluctant to believe I was anything but a slut, he seemed to get irritated to think of anything other than that I was a slut. I think he just doesnt realise he's sexist. Or at least that's the excuse I'm using so I can stay his friend,  Reasons to: Because I always have  Reasons not to: No Fun Never helps me feel better Makes me feel bad Have nothing in common I never get to see  Well I never studied history so I don't know if it's worth it.
