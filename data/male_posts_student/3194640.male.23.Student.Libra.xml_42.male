I've been trying to sit down and write them, but it's been practically impossible. I need to stop procrastinating (cable TV is going to lead to my downfall). I'm not trying to justify myself, but it's been pretty hard to write my papers because I've been so exhausted after work and school. I'm going to write my ethics paper tonight and then we'll go from there.
