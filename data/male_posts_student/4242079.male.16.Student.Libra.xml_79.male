I got off work at about 7ish, and came home, tired as fuck with no solid plans for the evening. I noticed the little green light flashing on the answering machine, and found that it was a message from Edward. Him and Miranda came over at around 9. After a few hours of sitting around here downloading miscellaneous things, we left to pick up Niki. I'm not sure how to spell her name, so I'll just leave it as Niki. If someone corrects me, then I will change it. If not, her name is Niki. I'd only met her once, briefly, last week at church. Apparently, everyone on the face of the planet knew her before except for me. We headed off to Red Deer, in search of the elusive Sonja and Karin. We first went to Billy Bob's. What a great place that is. We left, and I splashed Niki with a puddle. It started a thing. You know the things, where everyone decides to join in briefly, until you all realize that you don't really want to be wet, and then you all stop. Good times. After a snack at Timmy's, we travelled over to Manhattan's, still searching for Karin and Sonja. And we found them. And we hugged. And I danced. And I was happy.  And I'm tired. Sorry for the lack of insight into my thoughts, I know how boring "what-i-did-tonight" entries are. Maybe sometime by Tuesday I'll write a long one, on what I think. About everything.  Good night, world.
