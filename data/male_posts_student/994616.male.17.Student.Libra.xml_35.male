When they discovered that their Bangladesh suppliers employed children under 14, Rather demanding that they be fired (they were the only support their families had) Levi paid for their education  and persuaded the suppliers to continue paying their wages while they went to school and give them a job whence they finished. now if that doesn't sound like a commendable company then i don't know what does.
