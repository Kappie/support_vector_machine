I feel really guilty about writing all the stuff about James and all the bad stuff that's been in the blog so I wrote 2 letters of apology to James and Sam.  Whether they accept them or not is another matter.  I hope they do beause I've been really stupid.  I was feeling really happy last week and this week has just been awful.  Somebody hit me...  The forum is installed and I wrote a few default topics and things for people to start debating on.  Hopefully it will be as cool, or maybe better than the last forum was.  I'm going to go off to bed now.  A good nights kip should do me good.  I hope Jamie and Sam read their emails tomorrow morning.  Sorry!
