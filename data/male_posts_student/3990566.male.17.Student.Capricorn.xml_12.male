"Thank you for calling SingPost. Your call has been answered by the automated #$% 1605. Please call again from 8am-6pm and weekdays and x am to y pm on saturdays." WTF.. this was what i get.. then i called again on the 11th Aug, morning.. the fella told me to retrieve the article as the branch stated on the note (it says Jurong Point Branch). so my mum went to get it.. "sorry m'am but the article wasnt posted here. if u want, i can tell them to send it to you again tomorrow between 2-6pm." that was what the freak say.. argh~ so now i am usirng the 56k unlimited which the broadband service provides.. anyway its free lah.. but i haf to pay for the toll.. so its not free at all.. -_-" guess i will be using the broadband from 12 Aug (if my family members dun cocked up again..)    i was on msn ytd(11 aug) and this old frene of mine toked to me.. his name was NG BIN HONG.. kinda rich fella wif fucking attitude.. i nearly vomitted blood toking to him.. he told me he was studying TOILET MANAGEMENT at home.. wtf.. then his msn pic was dam lame lor.. he edited e default msn pic.. sld upload it nx tym if i can.. u guys will surely luff when u ppl see that.. he told me his ambition was to become an archiologist(or wadeva u ppl spelled it).. lame.. such a fucker an an archiologist.. i think he will dig shit out of the soil la.. or go lim chu kang there dig graves.. haha.. then he now studying in NIE campus at Queenstown there (this was wad he said). he is a very democratic bastard lah.. he kept saying that the singapore govt sucks etc.. good in his humanities coz he always has alot to say..     i was so happy ytd(11 aug) coz i managed to learned some new html code from teo de blog. he din really reach me anything. he jux tell me "eh allan, if u wanna learn then go view my source. i dunnoe how to teach u coz other ppl teach me tt de.." somehow, i jux copied and paste the codes in which i can reconise. haha.. but anyway, i haf to thank teo for this lah.. i used to be very good at html last time.. i can do alot of shits (coz i last tym got learn myself mah..) then aft some events in sec 2, i dun feel like learning anymore so i stopped. then now i almost forget most of the IMPT codes liaoz.. haiz~ gonna buck up abit man.. maybe i muz go buy the book on HTML. then also on macromedia flash. i always wanted to create a movie clip either using the cartoon format (using macromedia flash) or film a clip my self then edit it.. hey, i used to be a director last time ok.. so i think i can be quite good at this lah.. too bad i din go mass comm.. anyway, my eng sucks lah so i dun think the mass comm ppl wans me to join them.. argh.. i also wanted to create my very own webby for my video creations etc.. haha.. but that will be when i am free lah.. maybe during the holidays ba..    ok.. i've been planning to study "A" level subjects during the poly yrs when i was in sec 4. then, take the a levels exams as private candidate in my poly 3rd yr. so when i graduate from poly, i wld haf 2 certs instead of 1.. however, with my current situation, i think i'll have to put that aside 1st.. coz i haf too many things to do liaoz.. even though i know that i can still do it with proper time management.. but i am lousy at time management de la.. so no choice.. anyway, i think i sld go on a diet then wif regular exercise if not it will be tuff for me to find a gf.. i wld like to haf 1, but i was afraid that this will lead to the rise of many problems like quarrels then affect both parties' everything.. problematic eh? but loving means forgiving and compromise.. haha.. y am i toking such shit? argh.. jux dun bother abt me.. i am mad lah.. and i think i need councelling on my attitude towards sch work. and not jux sch work.. its everything.. i wanna be good in everything.. but i think i am blocking myself from doing that.. dunnoe wad's the problem..     hey, my life time ambition was to become someone as successful as Sim Wong Hu(maybe even Bill Gates).. I wan set up a company that deals with computer and IT stuffs. I had this ambition when i was in primary 5 or so.. up till now.. haha.. we shall see if that day will ever come.. seeing me on TIMES magazine and headlines of news being the youngest most successful entreperneur. then when that day comes and i haf the money, i will make sure that every1, especially those less fortunate people, gets computer education, either for singaporeans or people from other countries in their country. I wan to build an old folks home too. then i will try to help as much to stop starvation in certain countries. I also wanna make sure that these people gets enough education.. this is because i believe that the people in the world should be treated fairly and equally. everybody was born as a human to this world. thus, they deserve wad others deserve too.. and i dun wan ppl to suffer..      wonder how u ppl think abt this.. i think most ppl will say this, " Eh Allan, dun be mad lah.. I think you are thinking too much liaoz.." coz this is wad most of my friends say.. and i will do all these if i were to be successful one day, with the ability to do so.. in the next 30 yrs.. hope my friends will still remember me by then coz I GONNA PROVE THEM WRONG.. and i am not mad.. this is wad i think and how i feel, thats all..
