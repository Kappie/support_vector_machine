They have both after mediocre seasons, risen up and come back, with great directing (Ken Olin should totally win an Emmy for "Hourglass". Of course, it'll go to Christopher Misiano, but still. He should win it.) to great acting (Victor Garber who has come a long way from  Godspell  and Ron Rifkin, who may have sown up his own supporting actor in a drama nomination.  I know I'm just pimping my shows here, but seriously? They're awesome.  Alias: Sundays @ 9 on ABC; 24: Tuesdays @ 9 on FOX.  Also, Thomas thinks you should watch Scrubs. In fact you will watch Scrubs! Because who's the boss of you? Thomas is the boss of you.  Scrubs is Thursday @ 9:30 on NBC. The Betty-one looks drowsy!
