And guess what happen last night, my granny was unable to sleep last night, and she is waking up everyone in the family.  She got scolded by my cousin as she is really very.. but overall, after the scolding, she keep quiet for a while and than i happen again, until 4am than alright.  Cannot imgaine if i really sharing a room with her when we shift to the new unit.  Yesterday, message her and ask her whether she want to go to see firework, but i think i'm late, she went to her friends house bbq tonight.  She also told me that someone want to get her a Roxy sling bag, and i was really like, and somemore it a guy.  So what will happen next, i really don't know.  Wanted to send her to her friend house after the firework and it happen to be the BBQ start at 7.30pm to 9 something, it like in between the thing. So nothing to be done but let her go for theBBQ.. quite sad..  Wake up around 9am this morning, saw xiang ying message.  Haha.. she was unable to make it for the firework tonight and now she is in the hositpal as she complained last night her stomach pain as she told me when she called this morning, i was shocked when she told me that she is in the hositpal. Everyone around me is getting sick. Even my sister also, yesterday night, a doctor came to our house to check on my granny, but come to the end, it more than we expected. My sister bone was in the funny shape and she need to go for a x-ray and everything, she cried the whole night and she is damn depressed.  First time ever i see her so depressed, feel so bad.   I still  belive in the what you give other, is twice what will be return to you.  So the people out there, always think that, what you give other, is what you will get back, twice as hard. So Beware! haha..  update later bah! see ya!
