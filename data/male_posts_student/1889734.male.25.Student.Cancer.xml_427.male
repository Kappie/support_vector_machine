A chief economic advisor to Bush speaks the truth - the export of jobs to India and China will make us stronger as a nation, and our dynamic economy will invent new industries because of it.  But many GOP figures howl and shriek in despair.  Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House - "I understand that Mr. Mankiw is a brilliant economic theorist, but his theory fails a basic test of real economics. An economy suffers when jobs disappear.  Outsourcing can be a problem for American workers and for the American economy."   Fools!
