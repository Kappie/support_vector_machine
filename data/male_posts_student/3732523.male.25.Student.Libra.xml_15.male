I get to move in about mid august - around the same time as my birthday. Some birthday present huh? I get to haul heavy boxes and furniture instead of relaxing. Too bad I can't call in sick and get someone to cover for me. Man, that would be sweet.  In other news, I think I'm developing a rash. and by  'rash' , I really mean  'strong relationship with my girlfriend' . I dunno what it is about her. She calls me up randomly to say weird things. Like, today for example - she called me up, and asked 'Is Rob there?'. Not so weird right? Yes - considering I live by myself, and there is no one else around to pick up the blasted phone. Then then proceeds to tell me about a dream she had involving ice cream, dancing hippos, and a couple of talking trees. The girl is insane. She's totally random, incoherent, and she slobbers a lot. I think I might marry her one day. She's perfect.  Earlier today I had what most people would call  'Breakfast' . Its the first time I've eaten food in the morning since Christmas. It was amazing. I woke up, went to the kitchen, made some eggs and toast, and ate it. All before 8:00 am. I really enjoyed breakfast. I think I might continue this tradition and explore other edible creations. I'm thinking about pancakes - I hear they're pretty good.
