I don't think.... yeah I pretty much just sat around doing nothing, being fat and nasty, hairy old Willy G.  I've been playing Battlefield 1942, Counter-Strike, and Pokemon Gold a lot lately, hehe.  Yes, yes, Pokemon.. I know.. so 6th grade... but oh well.  I recently found my Gameboy, so I might as well use it, you know?  Today I sat down by the creek for about an our laying out on the rocks reading  I, Robot .  It was very relaxing, hehe.  I am almost done with my English section of summer work... then off to working on history... which will be oh so much fun.  My cousin went to a Less Than Jake concert in Birmingham, which is awesome, hehe.  Hmm... Warped tour in 7 days, Claire back in 3!  So many good things happening soon! Hehe.  Yeah... soo, yeah.
