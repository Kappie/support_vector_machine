So yay there. On to happier things.  Today I'm going to run into town on my one day off of work this week to pay my bills (that's why I work in the first place...I think. It's either that or indentured servitude.) and waste my time somewhere other than in front of the computer. GO ME, ROFFLFOEROLOL!!!!111 And remember, a wet dog might stink, but at least it's cheaper than your stank-ass cologne, biotch.
