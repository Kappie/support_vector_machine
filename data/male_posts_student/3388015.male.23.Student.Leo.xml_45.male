We headed to marketplace and I bought a couple pairs of shoes (sandals and boots).  I also bought 2 new dress shirt/tie combos at JCPenny.  They're pretty nice, I look forward to wearing them next week at work.  Laura and I went and picked up Luke at CompUSA (I love that store...).  While I was there, I picked up Krispy Kream donuts for a graduation present to Jake and Kristen.  I felt bad I couldn't give any to Laura and Luke.  I suppose I could have gotten a couple extra.  :)  We headed to park lot, dropped off two cars (Luke's and mine) and headed to the Lilac festival.  It was freakin cold, but we managed to buy a candle and Luke bought a bird house gourd.  We ate Nick Tahou's garbage plates (a must at the Lilac festival) and then headed back to our cars.  I went looking for Cindy and Sheila, but they were both out to dinner.  So I headed back to the apartment and hung out for the rest of the night.
