One of my best friends, Goran, will be moving to Myrtle Beach (lucky bum!!!).  Today is probably the last day I will see him for a long time, until that is, the big bus trip to go to Goran's new house!!!!  Sign up @ Marsbar988@aol.com.  Until then, farewell Goran.  East will miss you, and so will I.  Peace out!!!  P.S.  Check out the photo below!
