Let's begin by saying that the New Zealand government, is the most democratic government in the world- they have referendums! It is these referendums that this group is fighting against. Now, I call myself a Christian, but so do the members of this group. I will not be associated with such a fascist group of political neophytes with objective ethics that scream "truth" and shut down any whimper of tolerance. Hypocrites.
