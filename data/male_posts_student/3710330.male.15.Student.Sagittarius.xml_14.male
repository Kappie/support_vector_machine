Sq, a man of many academic achievements, a leader in many of the adversaries encountered in scouting, a conquerer of everyone's greatest fear, and above all, a diligent worker. Any woman would die to get him, even just a touch from him, nothing would stop them even if it means losing their most precious.  He has the talented ability to manipulate my mind, just through the words that he utters. He has that powerful aura, turning all living creatures passive and submissive to him only. The charisma he displays, never fails to attract me, the way he speaks and moves are of great chivalry and gallantry. His voice is as matured and gentlemanly, and the words that pour forth so richly out of his mouth, are of depth and quality, befuddling and overwhelming the nerves in me. Never had I seen, and even made friends with a person of such perfection.  Mastering the enigmatic world of Physics and Chemistry, leaves an intelligent being in him. When everyone are only newbies and possessing only rudimentary knowledge of the subject, he would have mastered the concepts and started in his bid to achieve 105/100 for the papers. Though an amatuer pianist, he has shown true virtuosity in music, entertaining us with his wonderful musical pieces.  A diligent god in scouting, he has far surpassed the level of respectability of juniors and gone on to immortality. Everyone worships him, I especially call him SQ, the master! He has proven himself well in scouting, and the only mistake he made was refusing everyone in the school to bow down to him whenever he went. Humbleness and modesty, are yet another of his countless virtues.  A wonderful person to be with, though he tends to speak diabolically, but that is part of the many well-planned operations which whir wildly through his mind. SQ, the master of the universe, the great emperor, the daring chemist, the aspiring physicst and the stoic philosopher...
