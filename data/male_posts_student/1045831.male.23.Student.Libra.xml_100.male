Thisis a huge revelation for me and something thaqt I vow to fix during the summer.  This summer I am not going to drink like I have I will diet and work out and become a person that someone will want to love.  It's kind of sad I feel this way but you can't argue with the truth.  This summer will change everything and I will be a different person.  No one will talk to me.  I will be like a butterfly in a cucoon.  The change will happen and then.  I gaurantee you.  I am going to be happy...
