It's a list of people desperately seeking a GMail account, which this blogger has so kindly collected a few thousand names.  I must admit, I still have not used all my GMail invitations, but I really only want to hand them out to people who I know will use them.    To all those people on the list....just wait.  While GMail is cool and all, it's just another email account to manage.
