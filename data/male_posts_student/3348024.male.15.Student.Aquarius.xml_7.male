I got the white and the fire for next friday and General Frye should be getting the green soon.  Funny story about Design.  Matt yelled something about mary ja wana really loud and Whitie was like, "Matt, What was that"  Matt replied, "I don't know it just came out."  I then asked matt, "Young man, do you kiss your mother with that mouth." "Yes," he replied.  I seeing this situation for what it really was said, "Hey everybody, Matt kisses his mom.  Throw some pencils at him."  No one threw pencils, but man, i could feel the tension building.  Matt was like the volcano that was ready to explode.  During break time, General Tim and I were about to dump the trash can in the stall Matt was in and everything was set up perfectly, but Whitie had to walk in and bust that shit up.  Then, in an effort to put the blame on matt, I yelled, "Don't you go wild at that Van Halen concert young man."  "Yessir," matt replied.  The interesting part of the day really started at like 3 though.  Amber and I were sitting, waiting for Kyle to get back from the library when amber started cleaning out her book bag.  She had some caffine pills.  I took two.  When I started to feel the effects of it, I decided to counter it with some chill pills.(prozac)  You could say, as Trent Reznor did, "Didn't turn out the way you wanted it to? Did it?"  Well, no in fact it did not.  It just gave me a really bad headache and made me dizzy as fuck.  We then travelled to Chad's house where we watched School of Rock (awesome movie).  That got over at like 5:30, which is when Amber's mom came.  Chad had left so it was just Kyle, Amber, and me.  Well, amber and I went upstairs to talk and Amber's mom knocked and came in.  She seemed kind of pissed and was doing some Charlie Brown detective shit.  We talked to her for about five minutes before she asked where Kyle was and why he had'nt come up yet.  So we called kyle up and he asked why and Amber's mom is like, "I just wanted to make sure you're dressed."  (Kyle and Amber are going out and it was just me kyle and amber there.)  Kyle came up, with his clothes on and she's like, ok, i'm going to get something to eat.  So she left and soon after Chad came home.  Chad and all the other characters drove out to the grange.  With no room in that car, I just decided to ride w/ Kyle.  Kyle had to pick shannah up so we drove out to Kesling Park.  We arrived at 6 and I had to take a mad yes(family guy reference)... So, I went into the area where they collect body waste and emptied my bladder.  We then walked over to the soccer fields to cheer Shannah on. We had about a half hour until the practice was over.)  So, we sat and watched those kids play soccer.  Shannah took some dude out, it was pretty kickass.  When that was over the headache from the mixed pills had worn about worn off.  We drove out to the grange where I took the pain killer that I had also gotten from Amber's backpack.  That fucker sucked, it's still making me shake and shit.  That's all I want to write now, so whateva, i do what i want
