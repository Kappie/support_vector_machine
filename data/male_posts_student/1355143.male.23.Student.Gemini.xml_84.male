For last 15 years Icelanders haven't "fished" whales for a profession but just before me and Svana went to BCN they started again with shooting 45 whales over a three year period.  It was in some countries outshouted that it was a scandalous that people shouldn't go to Iceland for that reason. Well Greenpeace did go a more civilized way of protesting now than 15 years ago, when they sunk 3 whale fishing boats, and did do Icelanders an offer that would be beneficial to the country. Well we didn't listen!!!  So German Greenpeace members did unite that every member would send a few letters each to every Icelander listed. And I got one. To start with the letter is in icelandic and says that the one who signs it did get a German version of it and does understand and agree with it. The biggest thing in this letter is that there are so many wrong things in it also it doesn't have all the facts like that we are fishing 45 whales out of (if I remember correctly) 6.000 and that they do eat a lot of fish away from us.  The best wrong fact is that the letter states that over the last 15 years popularity of whale meat has reduced substantially due to among others chemicals in the meat. Ok I can only talk for myself but the main reason in my believe is that it hasn't been AVAILABLE.   So now I'm writing this German Salim (good name for a German)to his email address he was kind enough to leave and putting him straight.  If somebody else wants to do the same is email address is s.hassan@gmx.de  About my injury I wrote about in last post the visual effects have reduced from the nose and chin and all I've got is this small Hitler like mustache.
