I got a bike today.. and while my dad was paying for it...the woman at the counter asked... would you like to become a member of our clubcard? You'll get a five pound off voucher since you spent more than 50 pounds...  My dad obviously agreed, and I, expecting a form to fill out, walk away... 10 minutes later I return, thinking that it should be over by now... and lo and behold, "Uh... how long have you been employed?", "What do you work as?" the form they were filling in looked like something you'd get from the Home Office... along with a booklet telling you how to fill it out :/  Meh...
