It is literally right next to Lake Michigan, water was nice...sunsets were great...lol only thing missing a was a girlfriend there >_  Anyways, I have 1 and a half days left of my vacation, and of course Ben has something else to do...so, I will probably spend the last say wishing that: 1. I had a girlfriend I could see, 2. be recording our cd, 3.  we could at least practice and finally 4. somebody would call me up to do something...yea...I am a crybaby I know...but these last days of my vacation are gonna suck...............lol...feel free to point and laugh at how much of a crybaby I am...
