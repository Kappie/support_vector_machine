You might ask, well, it's because I was with the coolest and best people I could be with, not movie stars, not astronauts, but with my friends.    Wow, is he an eating champion or what? Well, he sure is rich if he can order 3 Aquas and 4 dishes stuffed with the best Mexican food around. great, let's go on...    And who is this in the foreground?! Oh, this is just a crazy Aussie guy giving head under the table.    And this is me of course, in my awsome shirt :DDD HEIL PUCCINI!  And the last picture...well, I just had enough of hearing G-Unit in the radio, seeing G-Unit in the tv reading about G-Unit in the papers. So I made up my own crew, coz "we are the real players around the block", not them.      Hey, ignore the TehBotol on the table, it's not ours.  Sophie's Website
