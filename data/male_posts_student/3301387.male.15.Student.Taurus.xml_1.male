Sup ppl, ya know, there's gotta be a first for everythin. first for this first for that. but if so, i never got first for anything else. i was more rather first from the bottom. N' Here i am on this com playin "love is only a feelin by the darkness" and it just strikes me. millions of things strike me a day. out of these million, just one is enough to change everything that 'everything' would be to you. you wouldn't go about two blocks thinkin in ur head what this kid walkin right past u was thinkin. It would never hit you. Wouldn't it hit you... yea but even if it did what's the use, you can't do anything about it. There are so many things, so many questions being asked, so many truths to be seeked but really, there isn't actually that need.  All i ever wanted to do in my life was to enjoy time. Each second of time that melts into an entity of what we like to call life. It's really better just to not question anything. Cos u can't let it turn, you can't make anything else change, you'd still die one day, you'd still be afraid for the rest of ur life of just one single second of ur life - death. One short moment of pain for a life of Immortality. I think if u could actually see death...it'd be just soo awesome. what if u could see death? what if you could see that exact moment of death takin away what we love so much yet hate. what would it be like? Death... i mean..like wow. ]    That's just one of these many million of thoughts that go round inside my head each day. Millions of em' just like fireflies , like a dragonfly infestation like Spawning. And it goes like 'zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz and ZZZZZZZZZZZ each time it passes my head it goes really loud just like______________________________________BAMPH*     ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Hi, I'm tom.
