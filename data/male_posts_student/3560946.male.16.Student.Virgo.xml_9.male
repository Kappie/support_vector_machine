Knowing that what the poor soul  would receive would have been propagandistic slander against the  republic, I offered my own reply. This letter is a classic, and feel  free to quote it when responding to questions about Lavalon:  "President Kelly,  For a period of about two months, former Sovereign Prince Kieran was  unable to administer Lavalon because of a computer problem. At the  time, the Sovereign Prince was virtually all-powerful in matters of  decision making, and at that time his decisions were lacking. Lavalon  was losing activity; it was falling-apart.  With the support of the webmaster, and several new citizens, Lavalon  was able to be revived. A Provisional government was set up and a  Constitutional Convention was held. Lavalon was transforming into a  Republic. Meanwhile, Kieran returned. At first he was neutral on the Transition.  He was neither for nor against, the change in government. However, as  fallen leaders often do, Kieran later moved to protect his waning power  by calling the Transition illegitimate. He publically derided the  Provisional Government, and then did the same for the new Republic  government. Sometime, in the midst of debates at micro-nations.org, the Kingdom of  Breuddwyd was set up. The Kingdom of Breuddwyd is an absolute feudal  monarchy with Kieran Bennett as its head.  Now, up until this time, Kieran Bennett was a legal citizen of the New  Republic. A crony of his, George Tsilis, was also a legal citizen. The  Republic was very forgiving, and hoped for the best. After attempts by  the Republic's Executive, Judicial, and Legislative branches to  reconcile failed, a suggestion was made for an International Tribunal  composed of judges from several micro-nations. This attempt, which  possibly could have spelled doom for the Republic, was also refused. I,  as Chief Justice, had no choice but to declare Kieran Bennett and  George Tsilis traitors of the Republic and to remove their  citizenships.  In my action of naming them traitors, I encountered substantial  criticisism from within Lavalon's Republic. The new President of  Lavalon, Zachary Klaas, publically reprimanded me for my judgements.  The issue simmered after that, and we watched carefully to see what the  external reactions, if any, would be. To our surpise and pleasure,  Lavalon benefited, though did suffer some losses. For example, a  micro-nation known as Gabilonia, hailing from Romania, adopted a policy  of non-association with us. Breuddwyyd established the infamous "f***  the Republic" pronouncement.  Alrodria and Natopia allied themselves  with Lavalon, and other micro-nations offered encouraging words.  Now, Lavalon is on the upswing. We have a fantastic website, and you  can check it out at http://www.lavalon.tk . Many things are planned, including a currency system. I offered my support to the change in government at Talossa /before/ it  occured. Talossa's situation was very much paralell to what occurred in  Lavalon. Even the way in which its provisional government came together  seems similar to what had been Lavalon's situation.  Lavalon is not anti-monarchy. Lavalon does not wish to foster  anti-royalist tendencies, nor proclaim revolutions or coups everyday.  Lavalon simply wants to move in the direction that Kieran once  envisioned for Lavalon: a Lavalon of democratic tendencies. There are  words in Lavalon's own invented language, Lavab, that express these  ideals.  Of Lavalon,  Chief Justice Xon"
