And , wouldn't ya know it, the day I figure out that they have a section containing anime DVDs, Excel Saga is all out. So I settled with getting the new SpongeBob DVD, and I will post the episodes on my other site later. But seriously, THE FIRST DAY!  Oh, and I think it's day 1 tomorrow. -Sane Intolerant-
