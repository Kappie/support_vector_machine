Somethign about my dad having the day off but my mom doesnt have time to do anything with him... idk...  I got my teeth cleaned today at the dentist. Does anyone else get skeeved when they polish your teeth with that weird toothpaste. I only went for the free toothbrush.  I just primarily hung out. I want to try out for SNL someday. I went swimming in Katies pool. Anna, Katies sister, decided to take an entire bottle of tanning oil and pour it into the pool. Oil everywhere, i had to wash my face, and Fred katies dad, went fucking balistic. Anna is like 6. Next thing i know, no ones mad at her anymore and shes eating an ice cream sandwich. HOW THE FUCK DID SHE GET AWAY WITH THAT! Oh well...  So, im too tired to type. Some other stuff happened... but you dont care. Well, goodnight.  Reactor  - The Juliana Theory  Feeling the Love  - Congradulations     You're looking my way, you're looking good Needs no explaining, it's understood Electric shivers, across my skin It's like a fever, and you're my only medicine  Could I be dreaming your touching                           I'm feeling the love as it flows through the air Lighting my fire, igniting desire It's hotter than heaven in here  You show me yours, I'll show you mine Don't hurry baby, take your time Know what I'm thinking, you think the same Tear up the rulebook, and maybe we can play the game  Could I be dreaming your touching I'm feeling the love as it flows through the air Lighting my fire, igniting desire It's hotter than heaven in here  WHAT A GREAT FUCKING SONG!!! THe chorus is catchy as hell. It was featured on that AXE commerical, where the dude opens the book and the girls shirt opens... you know that one? This is an extremely underground band, Reactor, they are from a small town in Europe and have like 6 songs. I think they have like one album with 3 songs on it. But the dudes voice is cool. They sound very familiar to Maroon 5. Very familiar... Goodnight.
