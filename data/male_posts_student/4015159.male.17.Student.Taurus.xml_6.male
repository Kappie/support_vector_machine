And it won't be the first time I've gone back, for I have been there more times than I can count. I would say that this one journey will be a part of my life as long as I live.          Ladies and Gentlemen, fasten thy seatbelts... I have completed Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3!!!          OK OK, its not as exciting as I made it out to be, for you lot anyway, for me I have no more stress to worry about! This one level was REALLY starting to TICK ME OFF! Anyways I managed to kick its ass in the end, and now Bowser is in a dark murky pit, waiting to be reawakened for Super Mario World. Which I'll probably buy 2 week on Thursday... ROFL... I WILL BEAT BOWSER AGAIN! He has just become my immortal enemy, and I won't give up until Nintendo decide to stop writing him into games!          So what if I get into games just that LITTLE bit too much?          Good Night, God Bless!          James - ed
