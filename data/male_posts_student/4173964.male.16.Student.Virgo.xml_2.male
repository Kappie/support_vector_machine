I just don't want things to change. I like how everything was during the school year. Even the bad stuff. At least I knew I had time to fix things. Now it feels like there's this huge weight pressing down and no way or time to change it. I just feel like I should have done more or resolved things more...resolutely. This summer has been an overall let down and for things to come to a close so abruptly and depressingly sucks. I just want to scream and let it all out but I'm scared I'll never be able to stop. I know that sounds lame but it's the only way I can say it. Fuck it's too late for this. I need some time to think things through. Tomorrow is another day after all.
