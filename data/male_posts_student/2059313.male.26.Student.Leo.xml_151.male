I arrived at about 4:45 and got to see some old friends.  Scott B. and I talked a little about what I’ll be doing, and we took a quick drive over to the MAC to check out the set.  Then we went back to the office and I headed to the housing.  This is really going to be weird, I’m used to the housing being packed with people… but only one of the three cabins are being used at all.  And there’s only going to be 7 people living here.  Four are actors, one is me, and the other two won’t arrive for another week.  Very odd.  On an interesting note, I got to visit with a friend from two or three years ago, Beth Brandel.  We talked for a couple of hours just about all kinds of things.  It was fun.  I went grocery shopping and believe that I bought enough food for the whole two weeks that I’m here.  Tomorrow I start work, I’m a little nervous.  I’ve Stage Managed before, but that was a college production, and it was cake, nothing to it.  We’ll see how this rates in comparison.  Good night.
