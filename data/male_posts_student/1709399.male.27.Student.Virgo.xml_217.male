I wasn't too keen on seeing it but at my brother's insistence agreed to see it for a few minutes but ended up seeing the whole movie. I have always believed a good story/screenplay is the hero of a movie. By that count, Autograph was a wonderfully etched movie with a simple story and powerful screenplay. Its one of those movies to which you can relate and have seen it happening to yourself or numerous friends of yours. Kudos to Director Cheran for making a Clean,decent film !!
