We might be having some problems transportation problems... hopefuly not, and i will be rocking out on the thirty-first.    you know what, i have NO TIME to post tonight... or im too lazy... yeah... well, today i, um, did nothing. My great grandma came over. Woo. yeah, well goodnight.      Yellowcard  Avondale     If you’re gonna rip my heart out,  could you use a knife that’s dull and rust in color.  (Once I die) there will be no way that you can cover,  that scar.  It’s hard. I know.  And if I get a little blood on you,  finally the world will know you’re guilty,  (know you're wrong)  of taking everything you’ve gotten from me  no heart, its hard. I know.  Mighty king of avondale  I just can't let this go.  Real life ain't no fairy tale  I just thought you should know.  When you’re finished with the surgery  I really hope that you will turn to me  and tell me all about the fun you had  when you were cutting up, you were cutting up.  Mighty king of avondale I just can't let this go.  Real life ain't no fairy tale I just thought you should know.  Living like a fairy tale the  mighty king of avondale it all went to his head, this royalty.  I stuck a knife into his back. Inventiveness is what I lack.  He’s always hanging up on loyalty.  Mighty king of avondale  I just can't let this go   real life ain't no fairy tale I jut thought you should know.    I love that song, my best friends dont. OH WELL> A lot of people say this is a touching song to them. Its also one of their rare songs that not a lot of people have heard of. Tommorow ill post another song like that... you'll see... you'll see...
