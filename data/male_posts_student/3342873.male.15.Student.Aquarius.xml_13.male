This got me thinking about violence without provocation......  Perhaps our human nature, in itself, defines that we, as human beings, do not require a motive to be violent. Perhaps we are inherently violent and simply spend most of our lives trying to keep the urge at bay. (Even subconsciously)  Is it at all possible, that we are born with the natural tendencies of violence, but are groomed ... from young ... to ignore it?  Children, with no proper social up-bringing (and even some 'with'.....) will instinctively fight and argue over a favourite play-thing. I've seen many cases where children as young as 12 months, instinctively lash out when something they like is taken away from them......  As a species, we have learned to harness most of this inner-hatred, but it is still there and occasionally rears its ugly head. (Think unnecessarily violent road-rage...)  The wild-men of yore, used to knock each other senseless with clubs. Are we really that much more advanced than the wild-men we once were? Perhaps we've simply found new and improved ways of 'clubbing' each other...............
