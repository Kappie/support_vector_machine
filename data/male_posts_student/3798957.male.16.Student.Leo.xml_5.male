I like to bike uphill for about a mile for about a mile until I have the privelage of having a heat stroke at the theater arcade, but it's just too much fun to stop! Seriously though, I'm nuts, I like to play till it hurts, stop a minute, then play some more. Anyway, I finally passed Sakura for the first time the other day. This makes me feel like a real hot-shit dancer because it's a pretty hard song, and I've been trying to pass it for a while now. Plus, it's one of those milestone songs that everyone likes, so anyone who can will  always  play it. Once you finally beat it, you know that you've gotten better, because you will recall so clearly that you spent weeks, perhaps even months, watching other people play it. Anyway, I've concluded I have levels in a Prestige Monk class, possibly of the 1337 D4ncin' Styl3 order.
