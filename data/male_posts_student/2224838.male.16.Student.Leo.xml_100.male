It's not a sequel, but the second half of the story set up in volume one (although it can stand on its own). Volume two has much more dialogue than the first, but I don't think it slows the story down at all. Although the dialogue may sound unnatural, it helps to develop the characters as they were not in the first half. As for the action sequences, the setting is much more confined and on a much smaller scale than in the first part. Nonetheless, the action is very fast-paced, well choreographed, and bloody. Together, the two parts make for a great story, full of unmatched action and gore, and comic-book style characters.   Make sure to stay through all of the credits. Not only should you see all of the people who worked on this movie, but there is also a nice little clip at the end.
