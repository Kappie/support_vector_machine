Well, this is an unusual case coz i am a  gay . That's right. He just ignorant of a boy who is tailing (perhaps peeping is the better word) him  can't stop thinking about his warm beam, intelligent stare, handsome look, gaunt yet impeccable figure........ Let me unveil the another twist-he ia an indian apparently, but i am a chinese! Don't give me a repulsive look  think that i am nuts coz u don't understand the pleasure of being a secret admirer of this cute youngster. i love him 4 ever!!!!! If u see this sasi, pls be acknowledged that somewhere, there is a stranger who cares ad cherishs u. perhaps u r clueless of my identity, but i hope 1 day, we can be friends.
