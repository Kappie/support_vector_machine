Lets just keep things simple and follow the order of the title ... here we go ...   The Tar Heels:  Thats right, my University Of North Carolina Tar Heels picked up a first round victory tonight by defeating the 11th seed Air Force. They now move on to play Texas the 3rd seed on Saturday, should be a great game.  Speaking on NCAA basketball, Daves team Syracuse made it past the first round with a win over BYU, and McCormicks team Duke picked up an easy win over Alabama State. Syracuse will now move on to play Maryland  (I STRONGLY recommend anyone and everyone to watch this game, it will be the game of the tournament)  and Duke is going to play the 8th seeded team Seton Hall.   The Leafs:  After a tough loss to the Bruins on Tuesday, The Leafs picked up a huge 3-2 win over the Philadelphia Failures tonight ... Mr. Brian Leetch had 3 POINTS and Calle Johanson picked up his first points in a Maple Leafs uniform ... Leafs and Avalanche are on Saturday, this is going to be a HUGE game as the Leafs need the 2 points if they want a chance at winning the division ... so lets all cross our fingers for a big Leafs win.  Speaking of the Avalanche game, good old Meg-a-rooni is going to the game in hopes to see Tomas Kaberle play ... he was a scratch on Thursday, but due to Klee's injury, he should be playing Thursday.   The March Break  The Shenanigans:  Well Scarrow brought you up to speed about the weather on Tuesday ... so lets skip ahead to Wednesday ... I decided to tough it out through the Blizzard and take my chances of walking to Daves ... lets just say I almost didnt make it. After taking a wrong turn in the snow, I ended up with snow on the INSIDE of my pants and shoes ... just ridiculously ... when I got to Daves it took me an hour to get all the snow out of my pants. Then we played some good old Gamecube and watched some good old stand up comedians (Warning: This show may contain nudity, "Well, I sorta need to know for sure). Daves mom then bought me dinner, Red Rocket wings, best wings in the entire city I tell ya what.  Today was really the peak of the break however. Me, Dave, McCormick, and two people not blogged about regularly, Dave's dad "Hollywood" and his nextdoor neighbour "Mark-o-lino" went to play some hardcore bowling (thats right, 10 pins with  NO    bumpers!) After I talked some big trash I opened up big with a Strike and 4 spares, but then choked and lost the first game with a final score of 107. Second game I just stunk it up and scored low score of the day with a final score of 84 (yup, I stunk) ... but the third game was simply the best ... not because I won (because I didnt, Hollywood took all 3 games) but because McCormick, using his "spare ball" (it was pink) almost hit himself in the foot with the ball, before getting the worst gutter ball in bowling history. I have never laughed so hard while bowling in my life. Good times.  Tonight was Shenanigans at the Scarrow's house ... only really funny thing was I called the Nirvana song "Smells Like Teen Spirit", "Smells Like Teenage Fever" ... nothing really big of note.  Only 3 days left in the March Break of doom ... Im guessing I will prolly hang with Scarrow and McCormick again 2morrow, possibly at my house which is unusual. And the weekend is still up in the air as to what I am doing ... I have been asked to watch the Leafs game with a certain person, but im not sure if THATS going to happen or not ...   Legacy Springers Final Thought:  Yahoo! Euchre is bullshit, I have lost 9 games in a row and my rating has gone down 122 points ... simply fucking bullshit.  Look for an update sometime this weekend from either Me or Scarrow.   Those contestants not appearing on stage will recieve...
