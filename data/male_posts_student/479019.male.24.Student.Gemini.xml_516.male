I had a dream last night where I was in a meeting and I outright pointed to you-know-who at work and ripped her a new asshole verbally. I've talked about how much I really hate her, but there's a part of me that knows we used to be extremely good friends. Part of me wants to sit down and talk things over, but there's also the fact that I know that talking won't resolve anything. I think that our personalities just simply clash. It just makes me angry and hate her when I think about how she treats people sometimes. I have to see her today at work. I wonder what she thought of my email.  Cousin Kelly is visiting tomorrow and staying until Thursday.  Hey Crystal... if by some chance you're reading this... you were talking about a show Friday?  Dunno what I'll be doing this weekend.  ***
