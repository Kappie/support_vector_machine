He found out that the final he was going to have in math on senior skip day is now moved so he doesn't have to come that day and that is a good thing.  Definitely a good thing.  And he does still have to make up days for weight training tomorrow which is too bad.  In Gov they just continued to watch Not Without My Daughter and then in english sucky stuff happened.  Tyke, Dr. Phil, and Amed skipped after a few minutes into class and went to Wendy's for lunch.  Upon returning they found out that that fucking teacher took attendance at the end of class so of course they got marked absent.  The worst part of it all is that the school ended up calling Tyke's house about it after Tyke left at night for the concert so his mom came down (at 11:40 when he got home) to talk to him about it.  Tyke played it off saying that he didn't know anything about it and that it is wrong but she is not liking what's happening.  This is really getting to annoy Tyke.  Sure, it was his fault for skipping but that stupid english class and school in general is really pissing Tyke off.  It doesn't help that Tyke is not in a good mood now anyway but this is just freaking pathetic.  Tyke is really disgruntled and angry.  He started off just being in a quiet mood but that has turned to anger.  And he doesn't know exactly what he can do about it either so that is tough.  Back to earlier on though.  After school Tyke downloaded a few songs for the prom mix and just sat around until 5 basically.  That's when he left for Dotti's to meet up with Purdy and Ekul for the Dashboard Confessional concert.  Purdy drove and they got there really easily by getting off at that one exit (whatever it is called).  There was a really long line of people that made Tyke think that they would have to wait for a while but it turned out good.  Tyke and Dotti had to buy their tickets at the theater but they ended up getting floor seats for cheaper than Purdy's so it turned out well.  And then they cut in the lines to get in quickly.  And then they just sat and waited.  Oh yeah, Tyke wore the pink shirt today and got the usual comments, along with some new ones.  But that's beside the point, whatever the point was to begin with.  Well the concert was good.  Val Emmich (yeah, thats who it was...) was good and Tyke got a sample of their "shits" and that was cool.  Then was The Get-Up Kids and Tyke didn't like them.  Then came Thrice who had 2 songs that Tyke knew he liked but yeah, he didn't end up liking them.  They played hardcore stuff and everybody was just moshing and shit and Tyke really wasn't into it so he just pushed people back if they got in his grill.  He was able to hold his own when he was like 8 rows back from the stage.  But Stare at the Sun was played and that is Tyke's favorite song of theirs, as well as Dotti's.  And then was DC.  They were good and they played for quite a while.  And the lead singer (really the whole band) gave some nice speeches about wearing a condom, voting, and just fun stuff.  He is a really cool guy.  He even stopped the music at one point cuz he noticed quite a few people were passing out or getting exhausted or whatever.  So that was really good of him.  It earned him more points.  Well then the concert was over and they came home.  And then Tyke's mom got to him and then he came downstairs and now he is a little bit less annoyed but he still isn't happy.  It's just too painful to deal with.  It makes him want to cry.
