Next week, dont bother to look out for any posts. There wont be any, as school starts at 9am and ends at 10pm. So tell me where do I find time? I feel that I've overspent. $140 in 6 days. Don't even know where all the money goes to. Never-mind, what's gone is gone. Just wondering how to survive next week with only ten bucks in my wallet. Either it's ciggs or lunch everyday. Let's toss a coin and see which one would I get. Just finished packing my stuff for school tomorrow. ITS GOING TO BE A LOOONG DAY. Tomorrow is potato cooking day.. Arghh.
