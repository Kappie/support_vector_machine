In this slim volume (111 pages), he uses the metaphor of a cup to describe life. Drawing much from his work with the developmentally disabled, Nouwen demonstrates the rare ability to express the most profound ideas in simple everyday language. By the first few pages into the book, I felt as if I knew this remarkable man -- he really seemed to be sharing his heart.  This isn't the Purpose Driven Life. It's not a step-by-step guide to finding fulfillment in your life. Nouwen celebrates "drinking" the good things that life has to offer, but he doesn't shy away from the adversity that we are all served as well. His message is both simple and profound: that living life to the fullest comes through drinking all of it, and that God can give us the courage to do so.  Recommended reading!
