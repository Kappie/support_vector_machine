My computer is currently kerfuffled with the connivingly calumnified (sorry, I was going along with the phonetic alliteration scheme) 'about:blank' malware, which is quite an unenviable thing to be, I'm seeking a solution to restore everything to good working order. This could plausibly include reformatting my hard drive if nothing else succeeds, so maybe no more updates for a while. My life is apparently shit, my Dad hasn't called me yet about my flight to Yankeeland and so I'm considering other places to go over the Summer. My poetry is coming along nicely, got six of the twenty poems which I want, two of which are posted here for your imbibement. I hope that at least one of my lines of pursuit succeeds, I don't want to be servite to someone else's whims and ultimately their bank statements, in a fucking office. I'm confident that I have more to offer to the world than slavery to an inheritant's cashpot, a capitalist ideal, two weeks a year of holiday and a wife, two kids and a semi in the leafy suburbs. Middle Britain, conservatism and a free copy of the Daily Mail at the Little Chef does not beckon. I'd rather die than work in an office, "swirling round in this familiar parable" as Maynard James Keenan might put it.  I'd also like to mention Glastonbury, which was in my eyes a triumph over the weekend on one front, and a dreadful failure on another. As some bloke out the Grauniad put it on Monday the whole things has been "embourgeoised" and with acts such as English National Opera could easily be regarded in the same vein as Glyndebourne. As much as I love opera (no, really I do, shut it you at the back) it doesn't quite fit into Michael Evis's fields, does it? Taking exception to that, lots of vibrant, exciting stuff at the festival, The Killers, Hope of the States, Muse, PJ Harvey, Goldie Lookin' Chain, The Stands (1-20 at the bookies that Noel watched, 20-1 that he watched from a balcony), The Stills, Snow Patrol, Franz Ferdinand, Scissor Sisters, hell even creaky old Morrissey pulled it off in style, among others. Paul McCartney was listenable and enjoyable, but the man is an insignificance to contemporary music as even though a lot of it has been deeply influenced by his work (Yes! That's right, I'm referring to Wings!), he isn't participant anymore and booking him to headline Saturday Night is pretty sad really. Lowpoints of the festival include Oasis massacreing 'My Generation', Oasis playing, the Lostprophet playing (okay, kudos to Watkins for saying that Oasis "suck", but then again I wouldn't be surprised if the corporate whore was willing to follow his marketing executives carrot into "parents suck", "homework sucks" and "avril lavigne sucks". Actually, no I think she does suck things*) and the Libertines and Radiohead not playing.  Mood: Phlegmatic and Gordon Brown-esque Music: Radiohead - My Iron Lung; Smiths - Girlfriend in a Coma; Scissor Sisters - Laura; System of a Down - Sugar; Razorlight - Golden Touch  *Tangential = Good
