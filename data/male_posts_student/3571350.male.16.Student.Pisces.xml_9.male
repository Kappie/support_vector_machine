My parents expect me to do things they dont even do for me! When Im sleeping until 12pm sometimes noone cares as they just talk aloud and play music loudly and the tv like i dont even exist at that point. but just now my mom at 4.20pm asked me to turn the music down because my dad is trying to sleep. its fucking 4 in the afternoon and she expects me to put my life on HOLD for him to get a good rest. show some fucking damn respect woman! This life of mine is so screwed up. My only way out is listenin to my cd's and writing here. I hate most of the times being treated like crap  but when it comes around to them they expect me to be oh ok ill do anything for you master of all universe(if you didnt know, that was sarcasm for all u dumbass'). I think Im gonna get some doritos later since im hungry and i musn't touch their crutons or ill get screamed at.  Its freaking hot!
