Even with Holden's very personal, eclectic ideas, interrupted and day-dreaming like train of thoughts, my brain can somehow feel a connection. And actually this personal and colloquial style is what really makes this book engaging, interesting, and awesome. I feel like I can easily follow Holden's train of thoughts, even when he daydreams from one seemingly unrelated topic to another. That's just how the human brain thinks. Salinger constructed such a real, believable teenager figure.  Finally, as Paul advertised so nicely, besides the great New York Times, there is also the great magazine New Yorker everyone should read. Especially in the May 23rd edition in which there was the famous article "The Gray Zone" written by Seymour Hersh probing the secret interrogation agencies and facillities that were in widespread use. All of these abuses we are witnissing today directly relates to the intentional or unintentional commands from the Pentagon (including Rumsfeld himself). But yeah, read this famous article "The Gray Zone" by Seymour Hersh.
