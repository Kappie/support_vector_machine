I say what a consenting adult chooses to do with a consenting toaster is none of the government's concern.  Besides, my toaster has a much better health insurance plan than I do.  But seriously, I've yet to come across a good reason to keep same sex marriages from happening.  and several good reasons to let them happen.  Although I do wonder, if you are a member of the clergy in a state that mandates same sex marriages be allowed to happen, are you legally obligated to perform the marriage, or do you get to choose which ones you want to do?  Because I'd be against forcing any non-government official to perform any religious ceremony she didn't want to perform.  Also, in the movies they always say, "by the power vested in me by the state of Whatever..." does the power to perform the marriage really come from the state?  and if so, does that make a clergyperson performing a marriage a government official?
