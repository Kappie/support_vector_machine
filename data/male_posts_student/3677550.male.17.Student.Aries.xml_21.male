"if"... nvm lar... next paper will try to strive harder... time to get on with exercising too... this few days i have no time for jogging and such... but if got time i definitely must go liao... got input no output really very jia lat... oredi got a bad comment from one of my classmates liao... sigh... it is that significant ar?
