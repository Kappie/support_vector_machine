Stephie, Mike, Elizabeth, Sara, essentially most of my friends. This means that LiveEye will become anchored by Shane, Camron, and Jerricka. Jerricka is good, Shane is decent, but Camron just can't do it. He needs to learn how to read the script before going live to the whole school. It makes us look bad. This does mean, however, that I will take Logan's job as director for the rest of the year, a job I am looking forward to.
