Some like to watch the Mayors fire work show.  Either way you celebrate our great nations birthday seems to be always a fun time at least.  I did what I always do for fourth of July, which is have the grandparents over and the rest of the family have a cook out, watch TV, and swim.  It's always pretty funny and it's always good to get the family all together.  Well, I suppose that's all I've got to say about my fourth of July hope you had a wonderful one as I did.
