Grammar  and punctuation wise  .  Haha! I mean, it's the least I can do. Plus typing like I did before made me look stupider than I really am. We can't have that now, can we?   Lately I've been having some weirdass flashbacks. Like I was young and had good intentions, but I remember my mom was going through some crap about her weight. So this one time I was like,  "Hey Mom, it doesn't matter how fat you are, I still love you."  She told me,  "Oh,  thanks  Timmy."  You have to realize that a 6 year old does not know what  sarcasm  is. I mean, I took it as oh hey she appreciates my semi-compliment. It took many years later to realize that she was being a smartass about it and in no way intended to like what I said. That is  NOT  cool Mom. It's also funny how sarcasm has become a part of my life. I think it's all her fault.   There was this other time, in elementary... I was chillin' at recess, you know, loving nature and stuff. So I pick up my rollie pollie friend in my hand and I'm like,  "Hey man, how's it going?"  And the meanest ass girl from Africa comes up to me. She was a long-time rival of mine, I don't know why, but I never liked her. She picked on my poor ass too much. Anyway, she goes,  "What is that?"  So I hold my hand out and I say,  "It's a rolli-"   BAM!  She knocks that crap towards my face and guess where Mr. Rollie Pollie goes? That's right, in my mouth. Down my damn throat. One of these days, I'm gonna get her. Sleep with one eye open...   I remember this one weirdass dream I had when I was about 6. Whoooo it was a spooky one! I think my mom forced me to wash my sheets, something about me being dirty, and so she took my sheets and threw them in the washer. So it gets pretty late. She tells me to go get them out of the washer  cus  because they're done, but I'm too lazy. I decided that it would be okay to fall asleep on my matress and have no worries about fumbling with sheets or comforters or pillows. I woke up pretty early in the morning. Or at least I thought I woke up. See, my night-light was on, illuminating one wall and casting some SPOOKY shadows. And all of a sudden, I'm levitating, towards my door, into the hallway towards what should've been the living room, only it was infinitely black... And like other dreams, you try to scream but nothing comes out. And then I'm back on my bed. Cheese and rice I'm getting chills thinking about it. So remember kids, always listen to your mother and  PUT YOUR DAMN SHEETS ON YOUR BED.    Oh yeah, I remember this other time, I was being a geek and I was like up at 2 in the morning boring people with my dreams... Oh, wait, that's not a flashback, it's a flashnow.   Well, my summer as I know it is nearing it's end. Thanks to band. Because Nimitz has the best band program in the universe. Shyeah, right. No, really, there is the need to start summer band early because... oh, I can feel it... yeah, we're gonna get straight one's this year at UIL. Like that's really gonna happen. This band hasn't gotten a 1 since 1999. I mean at least my other school won shit occasionally.                     urlLink
