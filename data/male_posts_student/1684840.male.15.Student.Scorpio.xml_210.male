Yes, I have been Alton Towers!  I haven't been for years and I was looking forward to this day so much!  Let me begin...  I met Craig at Tesco at half past eight, and then James and Sam.  We called for Chris and steven then made our way to the train station in town and waited impatiently for the magical bus that was to take us to the Towers.  We againa sked about the price and whether it included a return journey as well and was told that it was £7!  A little peeved off that we had been told it was free, then £5, then £7.  When the bus arrived, driven by a cheery lady, our questions had been answered.  The bloody bus was free wasn't it!  Happy and relieved, we ran into the bus and finally settled on the top deck.  I have never had such a noisy bus ride in my life.  A rowdy group of Girls and Indian people from London were shouting and singing all the way there and we chatted to this cool girl who sat in front of Chris.  On arrival the bus errupted with cheers (the rowdy bunch of girls thought it appropriate to start singing the Alton Towers theme tune  ).  We queued for about 20 mins and finally reached the ticket kiosk, hoping that our vouchers owuld be accepted for the discount ticket.  THe woman in the desk took the money and the ticket, scanned it and drew over the voucher and passed a map and ticket.... WE WERE IN!!     Relieved that the plans had worked out brilliantly, we headed straight over to Spinball Whizzer which twisted and turned its way throughout the queue and up into the air.  It is an amazing ride!  Unfortunately we didn't get to go on it, but it was a brilliant sight anyway.  Next stop, the toilets, followed closely by a ride on Oblivion.  Sam opted out and offered to record our silly trek around on one of the most intense coasters ever.  We queued for about an hour and then the ride came to a halt.  It had started raining slightly and people began to groan.  After about 10 minutes, the ride sprung back into life and everyone gave a cheer which could be heard everywhere lol.  We got closer and closer to the ride...    There we were, strapped in Oblivion and there was no turning back.  The cart began to escalate the track and we waved frantically so that Sam could see us and begin filming our daring adveunture.  The cart reached the summit and then our pulses begain to raise.  This was it!  We reached the end and faced down, then paused, followed byt he eerie, "Don't Look Down" said by the scary man.  WHOOOOOOSH!!!   We plummetted down the 200 foot verticle drop.  I screamed my bloody head off.  The ride was so intense you felt like you were free falling much faster than you would jumping off a building... face down!  After that I felt very shaken and my thoughts drifted over to the plan of going on... Nemesis!    We grabbed our photo (I look so tense!) and head to KFC for a bite or two to eat.  We had just finished ordering our food, decided there was nowhere to sit indoors and eat outside when the rain came down!  It was absolutely hammering it down and the poor people on Oblivion were escalating the track!  The got wet and dried all in the same ride lmao.  After a few minutes it went off and we made our way to Ug Land.  Everyone except for me (still shaken by Oblivion  ) went on the Corkscrew and then the Ug Swinger.  We made our way across the winding paths and gardens to Forbidden Valley.  We all had a go on Blade and then Chris and Steve went on Ripsaw whilst the rest of us went to check out Air.  If the queues were not so long, we would have gone on it no sweat!  It looks like an amazing coaster, not too fast and doesn't go into any large loops.  Pitty we couldn't go on it really   We all met back up and then went to Gloomy Wood.  The queue for Duel was nothing so we ran around the path and straight into the slanty building.  Couldn't help laughing at the zombie outside in his crypt with a laser gun.  We soon got onto the train carts and armed ourselves with the super cool laser guns.  We shot loads of spiders and zombies etc.  The ride was amazing.  It cut out half way through lol and broke down!  I added another photograph to my collection and we head off to Katanga Kanyon.  We went straight onto the Rapids.  We were really sure the people in front of us were smoking something naughty   It smelt nasty whatever it was!  Anyway, the ride.  We got on and zoomed around the entrance into the main body of the ride, splashes of water coming over the boat from all sides.  T'was really fun!  I was the only one who seemed to get completely soaked lol.  I got a wet bum   I got the photograph from this ride too!  We head towards Merrie England in hope that we could have a bath (on Flume  ) but the queues were much too big sadly   Me, Craig, and James hopped on the teacups and Sam took pictures of us spinning and spinning and spinning away!  We made our way back to the Spinball Whizzer for another look and messed around on the field taking photos.  We then spent our last minutes in the shops.  I bought some stuffed toys and pens etc. and we sat down for a bit, shortly leaving the park for our bus.  The bus arrived and we boarded and inhabited the front of the double decker on the top deck once again!  Everyone who we had seen earlier on our bus ride to the park boarded - except for the rowdy girls.  The bus set off, bye bye Alton Towers!  After an amazing day we were relieved, and a bit sad to be leaving.  We laughed so much when we spotted the rowdy girls lying down on the grass... outside the park!!  The bus driver had specifically said to wait where she had dropped us off.  Oh dear!  We had our own unique ride down the steep hills and tight roads of Alton and we recorded some of it.  We arrived in Stafford quite tired and very happy.  Me, Sam, and Craig walked home together and chatted about how cool the day had been and how well it had all worked out.  There were no problems with any vouchers or tickets and everyone had enjoyed themselves so much.  It is definitely worth a revisit sometime if possible!  All of the cheap deals end Sunday and I doubt there is a chance of going tomorrow!  This has been one hell of a blog post, and so it should be too   I shall post images of our day in the Gallery as soon as, and get the ride photos scanned shortly soon.  I keep thinking it is Saturday but we have 2 more days of school!  Poor teachers, sitting there at school while we poo'd ourselves on Oblivion
