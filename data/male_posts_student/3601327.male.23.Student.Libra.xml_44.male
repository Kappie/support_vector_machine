Just so long as I'm clear about that.   P.S.: I completely disagree with either side of that argument - they are both far too extreme for my tastes. Although I do honestly think that any terrorist would rather have anyone in the White House other than Bush, so the Kerry bumper sticker is correct in that regard, but the implication that Kerry is Bin Laden's "man" is going a bit far.    UPDATE:  more on the  urlLink Bush = Hitler  comparisson (a truly excellent read and a well defined comparisson, a must read in every sense).
