Ah, the sweet, sweet smell of normal life. Then again, this now means I have no excuse for skipping class and not doing homework.  DRAT, DAMN YOU DR.BADGUY, DAAMMMNNN YOOUUUUUUU!!!!  Oh well. I've finally gotten over the plague that was She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Her poison has been sucked from my veins and I am now back on the  International Market of Luv . W00t!  I'd like to take a brief intermission here and offer a nice round of applause for the  BOLD  button.   Now then. Where was I? Ah yes...I've grown a bit distant from my best friend. Not quite sure...I think he's playing with fire again as well (GIRLS). I hope things can go back to the way they were. Do I have a certain lucky lady in mind? Perhaps. We shall see. As far as my life outside of school goes...at this point, it has become nonexistent. My typical night now consists of watching TV, running, touching myself, talking on the computer, touching myself, reading, touching myself, then a nice rinse and repeat. Oh well. My life is boring. I suppose the next big thing to happen to me will be prom. Only 2 more weeks.   Ok, I'm done. May I be excused?
