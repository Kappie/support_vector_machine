B: "Oh... thanks."  Character A is expecting some sort of "yeah, you've got a nice beard too" comment back, but doesn't get one.   Later, during a break, A sees B talking with some other guy with a beard. They seem to be talking about beards, and their strategies for shaving them. This other guy has a cool-guy, sharp-edges beard like someone from a boyband would have.  After break, A mentions something about that other guy's beard to B. B pretends not to know what A is talking about.  -----------------  Next class: A walks in with a beard just like the one the 'other guy' had. He takes a seat. When B walks into class, A says "what's up" and B just walks by him and sits somewhere else.  A walks away dejected.  ----------------  Next class: A walks in with a moustache and sits next to another dude with a moustache.  A:"Nice moustache."  Theepisode ends.  -----------------  This couldeither be its own episode or somehow be spliced into an introduction episode...
