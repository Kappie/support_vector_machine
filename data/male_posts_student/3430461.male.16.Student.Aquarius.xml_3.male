Sigh. And I've got all the hard ones coming up later like English and History. I hate timed essay writing.  Music tomorrow. Doesn't help that I've only had about 10 hours of lessons, but hey, c'est la vie. Or, as the French say, that's life.  On a similar note, I love the crossovers between our two languages. Like, there's the French Horn (which the French call the German Horn), and the Cor Anglais ( English Horn ). Its stuipid. Then there's French Leave (sciving), which they call English Leave (in French. durr). Likewise with the French Disease (siphilus) and a French Letter (a condom). Laungages are a load of *insert expletive here* when you come to think about it really!  Back to today then. Well, it was a pretty samey day, other than the whole exam thing. My foot decided to die when I was walking home. I get this pain in my ankle, and my whole foot goes numb. Its a bugger, I can tell you that. Just about every joint in my body clicked while I was in the exams. Fingers, knees, elbows, backs...one of my freinds (Rebecca) can click her eye! She's just weird though. Allergic to loads of stuff.  Anyhoo, I should probably go off and revise music or something like that. ooh, no, its te-ah-time-ah. Yum yum, veg and two veg (I'm a vegetarian, or more acuratly, a piscitarian {I eat fish}) mmm brackets   p.s. I promise not to call my next blog "My fourth blog... o-iii
