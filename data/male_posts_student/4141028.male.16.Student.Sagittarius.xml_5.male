So that makes me....  --School System Webmatser --SCHS TV Producer --Yearbook Stafee  I like it.    I met a few cool people.  They're girls...I can't seem to make any male friends, wait, I take that back.  I made 2 male friends.  They're kinda country but I can deal with it.  They want me to run cross-country...no.  I can't run from my house to my van without giving out.  I tried cross-country in 9th grade...I did it okay I suppose...I just kinda...passed out.  So no more of that for me.
