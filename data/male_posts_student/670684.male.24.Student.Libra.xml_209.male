It's not a pixelated scene, where I wear a dilapidated light blue and green Hawaiian shirt, looking like Adam Carolla and talking like Ray Liotta...and there aren't Haitians and Cubans and Mistress Cleo with the big boosoms telling me to kill the Cubans to save her Haitian boys...it's just the homes and the streets, and I'm running, and I'm always chasing old girlfriends or old crushes.    It was Lauren Jackson last night.  Probably my worst screw-up in having a chance and talking myself out of it and not taking it, and then talking myself into it only when the moment is well past.  There's a monologue about her in a one-act I wrote last summer or so, talking about jazz and tenor sax and a sultry voice crooning out lullibies with stand-up bass, smooth piano, and brush drumbeats.    Why did I need to get ahold of her?  There was a reason, but reasons are never to be remembered...Tom Clancy writes novels about events, while Stanley Kubrick made movies about people.  Watching Dr. Strangelove, it is evident that his initiative is to show how the people at the time were dealing with the situation, rather than the Cold War itself...compare that to The Sum of All Fears, where Ben Affleck gives a hollow performance of a hollow character, because Clancy is interested in the event rather than Jack Ryan's growth and individual foibles.   But Jack Ryan is a great character...I feel like I know him from all his books.   I know, but I also felt like I knew Zach Morris.    I dream like Kubrick.  I was running after her.  It was imperative that I talk to her.  I think she had some info on two people I was looking for.  But Lauren didn't want to talk.  She didn't run away from me, but she quickened her pace...so maybe she did want me to catch her, because Lauren can run.  She can also throw a water baloon sidearm at a small hole in a concrete structure and fling it with such force that its whistle through the air causes tritones.    I caught her.  She looked at me, tired, beaten, in no way interested in holding a conversation with me.  And I just started apologizing, not carrying on the conversation with her, keeping her there much longer than I needed to because I needed to apologize for keeping her there.  I have nothing to apologize for.  I apologize every time I seem to speak to her.  I saw her at Centenary's graduation, and I'm sure she saw me.  We didn't talk.  We didn't say hi.  I won't even contact her roommate, a friend of mine before Lauren, because I know that I was mentioned and probably defamed for my overt stupidity.  She looked wonderful...healthy, fresh, excited...personified success.  I felt short and fat and muggy.
