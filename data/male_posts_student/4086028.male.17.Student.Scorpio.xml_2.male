All I have to accredit my status is a yellow card which reads  "This card confirms that the carrier is a bona fide PROJECT TRUST VOLUNTEER".  That and my ununique enthusiasm for something different, that selfish desire to feel like you have deserved. I'm not that different from my friend Vanna, but we will come away with two different tales. This is your opening to shimmy to the left :  urlLink http://www.thoughtsfromchina.blogspot.com/  I'm not under the illusion that my going away will benefit anyone more so than it does me, but in the last twenty years more than two hundred and fifty different regions and cities have fallen suddenly open. All the people I've spoken to have opinions that are not far-removed from my own. Would it be insulting of me to believe everything that I hear? Initially I was seized by the foolish idea that each one of them would withhold some secret from me - some simple, perfect illumination. Because that is the foreigner's obsession in China. A billion uncomprehended people. I don't want to fall suspect to the nagging feeling that I can. I don't want to teach for a living, I want to learn. China, teach me.
