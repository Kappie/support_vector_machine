But there's a catch: Riddick came out in the last two weeks, so it's some sort of special event.  In other words, the free tickets aren't any good.  But I don't think this movie's going to make it past the two week mark: straight to video, that's what I say!  I'm reading  urlLink Dune .  Obsessed with it, in fact.  I want to be Paul Maud'Dib.
