And also on a different note, I was going around the net and looking around "naughty" sites (not porn) but serial, patch related sites and I said yes to one of those windows that pops up. Guess what happened? Facking spyware that's what happened!     Oh the pain! Internet Explorer sucks! So now I'm using Mozilla. And I still can't get rid of the fecking spyware.     Computers are useless, they only give you answers.... to more problems
