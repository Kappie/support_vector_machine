So, in keeping up with my annual posting method, I also changed my template, using al of my incredible knowledge of HTML (see Webmonkey) in the process. But fear not dear readers, by which I mean me. I have not "gone" goth; this set-up is merely a result of penis envy.  Yep, thats it. See you next year, and don't stop being beautiful (all non-beautifuls will be killed on January 1st, 2005).
