I want to take a nap, but I'm too lazy to move to the couch.  I want to do stuff with friends, but they're all doing better stuff probably..and I'm too lazy to dial their phone numbers.  I'm actually losing all momentum for writing this blog...I'm gonna go get sum puppy chow and Pepsi, then I'll be right back.  **back**  I now HAVE the puppy chow and Pepsi, and i went to the bathroom....but I haven't actually opened them yet...either of them.  nope, Pepsi's open now.  and the puppy chow.  I was grumpy on the bus ride home, but then I was fine just before gettng off the bus.  The only reason I can think of is because I didn't get to hang out with Keli after school.  Why are girls so confusing???  Seriously, I never can know if they hate me, love me, don't kare, or whatever OTHER 2 billion emotions they have.    Why are girls so addicting???  Maybe they aren't too other people, but they sure as hell are to me.  Sure, it's in my family to become easily addicted to anything..which is another reason I stay away from any of those bad things, but, they're just kool!  I wish I was more deep...I don't think I am really, unless you try to get me to share emotions, then you very well could drown trying to get them from wherever they reside in me.  Everyone always talks about deep stuff, like the meaning of life...and awesome stuff like that.  I can't....I don't why, I just can't!  I would LOVE to wonder about that stuff....but I just don't.  I kinda accept things as they come.  Like the Philosophy Club or whatever Mrs. Loney is starting, I would LOVE to go to sumthing like that, but I would just kinda sit in the corner and listen...that's all I ever do, sit and listen....I'm not really a go-get-er, I'm a sit-back-and-listen.....er.  STACEY FIGHTING IS THE KOOLEST*!!!  It's just so much fun to do with a bunch of your friends when you're really bored and have nothing better to do...or when you have plenty of other things to do, you just don't wanna.  Like Kyle Bear pointed out this morning, "Didn't we stop that kinda thing when we were in fourth grade?"  Yes, we did you jackass, now go away and let us have our FUN!!!  Ah, to be a little kid again. *NOTE: The type of slow fighting we do when we're bored   Ah, to be a little kid again.  That would be nice, except for the fact that I would have even MORE school left.   Then again we get nap time, and snack breaks, and RECESS!!!  But girls still have cooties and that means no Keli...*sigh*  I wish we had recess, that would make the day a LOT more fun..and it would go by faster.  I'm constantly falling asleep during 2nd block, adn constantly getting yelled at for it...by Mr. Hjersjo and students alike.  I don't know why I'm so tired in that class.  I have nothing more to bore you with.  Peace!  Spense
