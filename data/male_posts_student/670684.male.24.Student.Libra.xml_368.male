Probably could have done it without one, but the gurgle my car emits when I press on the brakes every time it rains isn't jolly, especially with a rainy weekend forecast.  Car goes in at 1pm tomorrow.  It's my car's first big sleepover at a mechanic, I hope it doesn't get lonely.    So a weekend of NCAA in Austin, where I hopefully get the work done that I would have lamented whilst in Lafayette.  There was a Los Lonely Boys call for a PA on a video shoot, which would have been righteous, but because of thought of going to a wedding, I passed on it.  If it doesn't rain, I think I'll go float a river...rent a kayak and hit it in the morning.    Waking up kind of early in the morning...was up at 9:30 today, which doesn't sound like much, except I haven't been up this early for no reason in quite a while.  Getting clothes washed, CDs burned, basketball watched.    When did this blog become  this is what I did today... ?  Maybe it's because my creativity is based in the screenplay, which is kicking ass right now, and I'm so focused on using stories there that when something comes up for the blog, I let it go and open up Final Draft instead.
