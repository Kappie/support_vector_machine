So now we're going through the booklets etc. for private halls and other such fun. A shame that our original choice didn't work out, but such is life. It's quite exciting looking through this stuff at where we'll be living next year.  If anyone is actually reading this, the University web site is  urlLink http://www.uclan.ac.uk .  That's all for now, just wanted to mention what's going on right now. See ya!
