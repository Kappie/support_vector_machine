    
       Today, in place of a tip, I'm going to post the official rules for the upcoming bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway (Mainly because I didn't have anything planned for today.  Tips are now going to be twice a week, Monday and Friday).  Here are the official rules for the upcoming contest:  1. Contest begins on an unknown date.  Stick with bagel.tech to find out more. 2. When the contest begins, you will have to do some searching through the site (including Blog of Bagel), to find the secret codes hidden in comments.  They can be anywhere...in the archives, even.  3. There are 4 codes posted every day. 4. You may enter twice a day. 5. Once you win, you cannot win again. 6. Contest will last three days, and one invite will be won each day. 7. Interacting with the site may increase your chances of winning*.  Each time you interact, you get 1/2 of an entry.  Interact twice to get an entry. 8. To submit an entry, you have to email the Gmail account that I provide, with the code, the place you found it, and the following information: Name: City/State: Age: Blog Address: That way, if you win, I can post a little bit of information about that day's winner.    Remember, interactivity with the site increases your chances of winning.  You'll get an entry per day for every time you interact with the site twice.  Be sure you check out bagel.tech every day, so that you know when its going to start.  Its going to come unexpected, so you have to check back to find out.  *-Every time you interact, it must not be spam!  It must be an intelligent comment to a post, including questions, compliments, etc.  All interactivity must be done before the contest begins.  ------------------------------ June 29, 2004- Wrap Up  What's that?  No 5 out of 5's?  That's because the really really good stuff has already been reviewed.  Sure, you'll see it occasionally, but don't expect to see it too often.  You may have noticed that come Thursday, we'll be starting the official ratings system.  The official bagel.tech is going to launch on July 1st with all new features, possibly even a new template, if I can find one that's good enough for the job.  But, don't be surprised if you don't see one.  The new rating system will be more accurate, and the reviews, as well, will be more in-depth.  Plus, we're going to eliminate the tips to twice a week, and add in some new features to fill in for it during the rest of the week.   Today, in games, we looked at Trivial Pursuit on Uproar.  This game is nice, it's a little difficult.  It has five modes of play, including the super hard "Genius" mode.  Answer six questions correctly and collect the pieces of the circle, and then go on to the "Winning Question."  Your final score is converted to iCoins, where you'll be able to buy prizes on Uproar.  Trivial Pursuit got a  3.5 out of 5,  which in the new rating system, will convert to a 70%.  Today's download of the day was Mozilla's Thunderbird.  This is Mozilla's answer to Microsoft Outlook, and is much faster, as well.  You can use your Hotmail and Yahoo email accounts with it, but you'll need a program like Hotmail Popper or YahooPops in order to do that.  Mozilla Thunderbird received a  4 out of 5,  which converts to an 80% in the new rating system, and receives a silver award.  Today's site of the day was GameRankings.com.  This site is perfect for a gamer who is looking for a good game to buy.  It archives all of the reviews that are written by various media outlets, and combines all the scores together to make a Game Ranking.  GameRankings.com also allows you to view screenshots of the game you're looking at, and there is plenty of user interactivity.  GameRankings received a  4 out of 5,  the equivilent of an 80% on the new scale.    Today's feature was the bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway Rules Update.  This new contest from me will allow you to win Gmail invites by interacting with the site.  This contest will begin at an unknown date, so you have to check back to see when it's going to start.  Three days, three winners, and another contest after that sometime.    Thats it for today's bagel.tech updates.  Tomorrow is the last day of June, and here's what we've got lined up:  Game: Collapse Download: WinAmp 5.1 Site: Uproar.com Feature: bagel.tech Wars #1: WinAmp vs. jetAudio  Remember to check tonight's Blog of Bagel updates, and see you tomorrow for another day of bagel.tech.
