It's just one of the classics that I want to get. Everyone else got me like money and cards and stuff. So, technically, they got me my next classic, The Legend of Zelda. Alyce is going to get me The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures. It looks really good from what I've seen. Then comes the gift from my parents. In the past, their presents have ranged from socks to video games. This year they did the unthinkable. They not only got me a set of house keys and car keys (for both cars), but they ordered me a new laptop. It will be arriving in around 1 week. This was very unexpected. I will work hard to be able to use the keys by passing my driving test on Friday. (1 day till my birthday)
