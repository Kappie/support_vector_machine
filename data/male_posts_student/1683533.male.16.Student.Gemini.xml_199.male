I called Evan to see if I could get my shit back, and then he says he didnt quit, so I guess we are gonna practice tomorrow.    Work wensday.    I think I'm open thursday...I might have a guitar lesson...    Friday work    I really need a new job. Mike, our white trash manager, is a real ass. He put me in a headlock, so I took a wet towel and swung it at his face. He seems to find great pleasure from other peoples discomfort. He hit my arm and that caused me to knock a ketchup bottle down, which broke and spiltketchup on his shoe, so to get even for ketchup on his shoe he could have just wiped off, he kicks me with the ketchup shoe, so I get ketchup on my damn pants which have to last me the rest of the weekend at my dads. I can't fight back cause I will just get fired, and I really need to get another job before I can quit.    -_-' I'm stuck    If you want to know how hardcore I am, I took a bubble bath today. It was  hottttt.    Looks like Blogger decided to be cool and add colors and other html stuff in.
