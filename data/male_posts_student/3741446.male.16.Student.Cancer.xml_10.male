I enter the usually pretty crappily run hardware store expecting it to be the sanctuary of it has been in the past. This was usually a place I could avoid the bullshit the rest of the world feeds us on a daily basis, even if it was poorly managed, difficult to navigate, and usually misrepresenting its products one way or another.  Today however, something was different. Upon entering the store, I notice the usual displays set up in the main isle. A few how to books, a couple of specials, not thing much out of the ordinary. Just then, I see something so horrible, so disgusting and vile, I shutter to mention it. "DECORATING WITH LIZZIE MCGUIRE!" Infact, it was an entire series of home improvent and craft books from Lizzie right in the middle of my beloved saws and drills. WTF KINDA 9 YEAR OLD GIRL IS GOING TO REMODEL HER OWN ROOM! Licensing has gone too far, and Disney, once a respectable company from my youth, has become PURE EVIL!  Tell me now, WHO COULD POSSIBLY THINK THAT ANYTHING LIZZIE MCGUIRE BELONGS IN THE MIDDLE OF MY TOOL WORLD? In the future, you stupid store managing assholes do your jobs and keep that shit in the KID'S DECORATAING SECTION if you must allow into my store at all.   LOWE'S SUCKS ASS!
