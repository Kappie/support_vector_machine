      Lots of things have been said about my top 10 favorite movie list, as far as almost all of my movies being more recent.  Apparently you're supposed to have some rules to your favorite movies and whatnot, and I'm supposed to include "classics" or something.  Those 10 movies just happen to be the movies I identify with for one reason or another, and movies that have made me feel something and have affected me, and I am into movies like that more than movies that are just entertaining or cinematically interesting.  I tend to think with my heart with movies more.  But I do like classic movies, so here is my list of my top 10 "classic" movies, classic being pre-1980.  I'm sure no one will like this list either.  Nick's Top 10 "Classic" Movie List:  1.   urlLink To Kill A Mockingbird    I adore this movie.  I still get chills when Scout sees Boo Radley behind the door at the end.  When I was in high school my girlfriend at the time made me watch this, and I've loved it ever since.  Not the most profound movie, or the artiest movie, and not really particularly relevant these days, but still a beautiful movie.  2.   urlLink A Boy Named Charlie Brown    I was asked a few years ago which character from Peanuts I would be, and I didn't hesitate to answer "Charlie Brown."  These days I'd still say I identify with Charlie Brown, but I think I lean more towards Linus Van Pelt these days.  I must have seen this movie fifty times since I was little.  I'm a huge fan of Vince Guaraldi's music.  I have a real soft spot for Peanuts, and a lot of the feelings that come across;  it's so bittersweet, and there's the unrequited love, and as I watch classic Peanuts cartoons, and especially this movies, I find myself sighing throughout the entire thing; it's just wonderful, and I *adore* this one.  I identify and feel for this cartoon more than most live action films.   3.   urlLink No Time For Seargents    Fucking hilarious.  A pre-Andy Griffith show Andy Griffith (and Don Knotts as well) plays a complete idiot who joins the army.  I laugh harder at this movie than most.  If I did a top ten favorite comedies this one would definitely be there.  Another movie a lot of people have not heard of.  4.   urlLink Silver Streak    I'm not totally sure, but I think this is the first movie with both Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor.  Very very funny, and also a bit of a thriller.  Gene Wilder falls in love with a girl on the Silver Streak train, and turns out people are out to kill the girl, so he tries to save her.  Richard Pryor plays a theif who tries to help Gene Wilder.  Not as silly at all like some of their later collaborations, but really hilarious, with a bit of action.  5.   urlLink Dog Day Afternoon   I'm surprised at how few people I know who have actually seen this film.  Al Pacino and John Cazale (Michael Corleone and Fredo from the Godfather) hold up a bank, and start a media frenzy.  Based on a true story.  You really actually start to root for the "bad guys" in this movie, and feel really sorry for their pitiful situation.  Funny in parts, sad in others.   6.   urlLink That Obscure Object of Desire    Luis Bunuel's last film.  This one is hard to explain.  Fernando Rey (who was in The French Connection) plays a guy who lusts after a girl named Conchita.  Conchita is played by two very different actresses in the film, apparently to visualize her shifts in mood and personality.  Conchita teases him and leads him on, but he keeps coming back.  Very surreal.  Pretty good "surprise" ending.  7.   urlLink Sleeper    I'm not totally a fan of Woody Allen; I like a lot of his films, and a lot of them I can live without.  But this film is one of Allen's earlier films, which seem to be funnier and sillier than his more recent films.  Very funny, and I have always loved the retro-future stuff.  My dad showed me this movie when I was little, and I did not get it then.   8.   urlLink One Flew Over the Cucko's Nest    This movie probably needs to explanation.  Just a great movie, and very affecting.   9.   urlLink The Black Hole    All sci-fi is cheesy.  (Star Wars is cheesy (I've never liked Star Wars much).  Even Star Trek is cheesy.  2001 is kind of cheesy, but much less so than most sci-fi.) But I love The Black Hole.  And it is cheesy.  But it's still cool.  When I was little, I loved this movie- the bad robots were scary.    10.   urlLink The Odd Couple    This movie was on my other list.  I don't care.  This is a great movie.  I love Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon together.  I love the Grumpy Old Men movies.  I love The Odd Couple II (though it's more Grumpy Old Men than classic Odd Couple).  I have never gotten tired of this movie.  When I can't think of a movie to watch, I go for this movie.    Top 10 lists are difficult.  There are lots of classic movies I love: Taxi Driver, The Shining, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Bad News Bears, Arsenic and Old Lace, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, Alice in Wonderland (the Disney version), The Out-of-Towners (the original 1970 version), 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Casablanca, Vertigo, Kiss Me Deadly, The Big Clock, etc. etc. etc.  I look forward to seeing Glenn's list; though he had some classics on his last list.  There are a few entries I would probably change on my first list; I'd most definitely take In the Company of Men off, and as I realize after doing this list, I'd add A Boy Named Charlie Brown.  Actually, I'd be tempted to stick that even in my top 5.  Top 10 lists are hard, and really only the top 5 are pretty solid, the rest really fluctuates.  I do prefer more recent movies to older ones; as stupid as it sounds, I tend to love movies that I feel the most for and that I relate to, ones that go a little beyond entertainment, or something.    That's all for now.  More things to pack up into boxes and bags, more things to throw out.  This time next week I will be moved and living somewhere else.
