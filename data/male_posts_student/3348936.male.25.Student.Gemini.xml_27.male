Even the tarts in the lane next to me did better (and they just lob the ball down the lane).  I di manage to get over 100 each game.  I must admit that the first two games it was only jusy over 100 (both 101).  I did have the best trick of knocking down all the pins save for the back left and then managing to bowl to the back right. grrrr..  But it was fun and stopped me staying in for a day....
