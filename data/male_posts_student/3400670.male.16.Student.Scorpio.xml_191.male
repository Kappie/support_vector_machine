I was watching a tribute to him on TV today and learned more about his life than what I learned about his political career from the history books. He was the oldest president to be elected at 69. He also lived longer than any other president. He died at the age of 93 in his home. I guess I never actually realized the major impact that he had on America until I watched his tribute. He was able to bring hope to Americans and bring them to an age that they were able to be happy. I never really knew about him until this year, but I wish that I could have experienced and seen his great presidency in action. It is funny, though, that I never really wanted to learn a whole lot about him, but after his death, he seems intriguing and somewhat of a legend, which makes me want to know more about him and his life. I hope that everyone will at least give there respects to the man who gave so much to our country.
