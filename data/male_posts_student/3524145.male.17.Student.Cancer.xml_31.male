Sometimes really think that i deserved the punishment of Hell... though i dun wan to ... but i have sinned so much... what else can i ask for... though i know that God is always Forgiving... whats the use of letting him always forgive me... i guess i deserve everything ... far away... i have walked so far away from him... far far away... far away... very far... i have side tracked my life so much... am i able to be back again... many times i guess i really feel like back slide and walk away from what i have been doing... so thati wun bring people under me away... so that i wun mislead them... so that i wun cause them to stumble... and also its really so tough to be a strong christian... its so tough... very tough...  have i been thinking too much??far too much ?... hrm... i dunno...         "  Am i going back?..."
