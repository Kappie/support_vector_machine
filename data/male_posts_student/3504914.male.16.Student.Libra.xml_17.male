I was close friends with three of them and I was on ok terms with the rest. That’s better than relations with my own class (all the people I bothered closely befriending have left xD).   All names in the following paragraph are aliases x)   Well, it was surprising to see Tino cry, she’s one of the people who I’ve always thought had a bunch of mental strength. Funny hugging her after as well, her grad hat kept falling off until she finally just clung onto it. Maurice was obviously her usual self, and I swear she could have killed me with her hugs. Then she bit my bloody shoulder! Damn her and her rabid mouth xD Fungus was her usual self, no hugging from her. God I’m going to miss that class… Tino leaves tomorrow at 6 am, so I’m not going to see her again until October. I think I’ll call her later, say good-bye one last time. GOOD LUCK TO ALL GRADE 12 STUDENTS!   I got a class blog started, though I have misgiving to its activity.    Topic : The Laziness of Man   .......................
