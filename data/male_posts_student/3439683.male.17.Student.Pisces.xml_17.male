I have this idea for another story or novel (i get lots of these, a lot of them don't go anywhere), but the problem is, I don't have time to type it up right now, and I'm busy all day tomorrow. Guess I'm going to have to hand write it while I'm at that camp this weekend. Wonder how THAT'S gonna be. Quite frankly, sounds like the perfect opportunity to put on my wallflower suit. You know how I am around people I don't know. Or at least, Brian and my counselor do. According to them, I stay in the background, pretty quite, until I warm up to people, then I'll talk to them. In other words, I don't seek out conversation, I let it come to me. And, if and when it does, I'll try to be sociable. Hopefully, I can bring my guitar...or maybe not. don't want someone to mess with it when I'm not looking. Honestly, I dread the social-ness of this thing, I'll probably end up withdrawing and getting depressed. But that's the worst case scenario. I always predict the worst so that it can't get worse than what I expect, it can only get better. ack, got things to do, must....leave...now....
