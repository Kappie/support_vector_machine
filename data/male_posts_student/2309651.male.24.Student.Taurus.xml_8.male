Actually enough was enough about a week ago, but now it is excessive.  In a newspaper where 90% of the writing comes from the AP or Reuters, the original writing is nothing but petty swipes at the Governor and at times, the President.  These swipes are not only coming on the Op-Ed page (although it is mostly syndicated writers from other papers), these swipes are coming disguised as news articles!  Take for example today's article.  The opening paragraph is remarkably the same as the previous days.  It says today:  It might be "bunk" to Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., but multiculturalism has been a priority in Maryland public schools since 1970s, when the State Board of Education first issued regulations addressing the contributions of other cultures, which Ehrlich is sworn to uphold  Is there any new news to Marylanders?  Not really.  It merely just points out for the umpteenth time that Ehrlich said that multiculturalism is bunk.  It has long been known that The Sun and Ehrlich have no lost love.  This dates back to the beginning of the Ehrlich administration when he said that he had a particular disdain for the Sun.  Now two years later, the Sun has gotten its chance at payback.  Ehrlich states his opinion on an issue, and the Sun runs article ad infinitum.  What this has really done is pay into Ehrlich's hand.  The Sun looks ridiculous.  It has been two weeks and there is no sign of ending.  Perhaps, the Sun should write more stories on its rapidly declining readership...I think that is more newsworthy at this point.
