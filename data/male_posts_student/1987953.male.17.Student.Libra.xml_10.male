Between homework, a girlfriend I talk on the phone with a lot, and All-County Chorus practices, time has been limited. Homework has cut down a lot, and now All-County Chorus is over. It just finished today. Tonight was the performance. I just got back from it. There are pictures. I will have them for you soon. I am also going to put on a song or two (maybe all six) from our performance when the CD comes in. I don't know how many people know how it is to sing in front of a thousand people (even with 84 other people). I know Mark does, because he sings with his family in front of many church groups.  Anyway, in commenting, mention something you've done in front  of a group of people and how many people were possibly there, where and when. Blog ya later! I promise to do better!  In Christ, Mike  "For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God." -1 Corinthians 1:18 NIV
