(sorry i was acting all wierd... thanks for lifting my spirits :) ). afterwards i went to a girls' apartment in my ward where we had been invited to go play some games. ( silent football ... to much to explain, but hella fun) and then kicked backed and talked for a couple hours. i'm feeling fine now, i think, and now feel dumb for being a bum earlier.    friends... not the sitcom   i've seriously got some of the best friends and the best friend right now. aint it great.   i think i'm gonna do some handwritten journaling now, read some scriptures, and get to bed...
