We are not supposed to talk things over before we do them. right it sounds like someone wants art to be elitist.  art should be discussed and thought about so you get as many different angles, points of view, ideas and information so you can make a better work / opinion yourself.  I didn't want to talk about my art major work because i was basing it on my experiences, though that later changed. however some artworks should be planned, discussed, modified to get their idea across better or to refine their idea. Yeah i know i have repeated myself but its this goddamn touch typing i swear.
