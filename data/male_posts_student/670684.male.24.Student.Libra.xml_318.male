I am a tried and true Padres fan, the kind that posts on message boards, keeps up with the farm system, feels like he has a strong understanding of what the General Manager is trying to accomplish with the team.  I enjoyed the division win in 1996, the World Series in 1998, and was ecstatic about the Brian Giles trade, the first in a series of moves that Kevin Towers has embarked on in order to return us to the glory days that our franchise never knew.    But my heart sits with San Diego's football francise, the Chargers.  When I moved from Arkansas, I worked to hold on to every aspect of California life I knew.  There was little in Rogers, except for the Sunday sports ticker that I'd get when watching a Cowboys or Chiefs football game...I could see how the Chargers were doing.  We never got Chargers games in Rogers...just the ticker, and maybe a highlight or two.    This is only amusing because while I was in San Diego, I was not once a Chargers fan.  I didn't care about football.  My mom and dad loved it, but their hearts were with collegiate sports, specifically the Arkansas Razorbacks.  We had hog hats and red shirts and we'd call the hogs in the living room, all pointless endeavors in my young mind.    It helps that the year I moved to Arkansas was the first year since I was a conscious being that the Chargers made a playoff run...they rattled off 11 out of 12 wins at the end of the season to win the AFC West and bring Charger Fever to the city.   And to Rogers.    I didn't keep up with the Chargers this preseason, because of school, the new house, and other grabass revolving around the baseball franchise.  They went 2-2, with an impressive win against San Francisco in their final game.  But the test was the first game of the season, in Kansas City, a division rival who is picked by many to go to the Super Bowl.  My Chargers are young, with a very inexperienced secondary, but they've got the best running back in the NFL in LaDanian Tomlinson, a great wide receiver in David Boston, and one of the marquee pass rushers in Marcellus Wiley.  Those horses, along with a talented secondary cast, should be enough to keep the Chargers close against KC, and if you're close, you can win.    As of Halftime, it's Kansas City 24, the Chargers 0.    I woke up this morning with the sole intent of watching the Chargers play.  Drove down to Click's Billiards off Oltorf, where, according to the commercials with the gruff rapist and the softcore porn star, the NFL's Sunday Ticket is in full gear, so you can watch all the games.  As I found out only after the drive and then enterance, all of the games, of course, means four.  With eight games playing across America, and Green Bay in one of them (I don't know why, but Green Bay fans take over every sports bar in America on Sunday, and they're so goddamned arrogant and pompous about their football team that it makes me cheer against a group I would otherwise have no problem with), there are three TVs for seven games.  Cleveland is on, and Cleveland is the AAA affiliate for Sports Fans who come out in droves for their team.  New England is on as well, and the renaissance the Patriots franchise had two years ago with the Super Bowl win is enough to grant them a television.  And Pittsburgh got the last one, because Gus wanted to watch that game.      I don't know where this is going.  I wanted to write about the gut-wrenching effect a Chargers loss has, while a Padres loss stings as long as it takes to change the channel.  Both are much easier to deal with now than they used to...I'd sulk all evening back in Rogers when the Chargers lost.  And there was a stretch of Padres games this summer, while I was in California watching the games on television no less, where they lost back to back games in the ninth inning, both of which were shutouts to that point.    Almost wore my Doug Flutie jersey today, but decided I'd save it for the playoff run.  It might do better in storage.    Just for kicks, an article using the cyborg test in Blade Runner to see  if those in the San Francisco mayoral race are human or machine   (special thanks to Bryan Alexander) .
