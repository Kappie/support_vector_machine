They purposely made themselves late i think. So I reached school at 8.01am. I was 1/2 hour late lor...sighz...thank goodness like nobody ws interested in catching me. So no detention..yeah!!! Then basically school was all slack. Didn't even have a single period of proper lessons. Then school ended at 12.05pm. Then joined some YFers at East Coast Macs for lunch. Cool huh? It's my school neighbourhood now! Okok..gotta go. I think I should pass my time to my sister instead. Ok, will be back tomorrow.
