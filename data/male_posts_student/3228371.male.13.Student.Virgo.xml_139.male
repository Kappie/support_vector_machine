Selling with Yasi and Nima. Cool. Blah.   Was supposed to walk home with Brian today but I took too long hehe! Neighbors were looking for sister -_-" Grr~ Hehe! Blah. *sighzZ* Stuff going on with itm, itf, and itf#2. But I'm basically on itm's side. Can't use initials and names so blah. Hope everything works out.   I think Roger has changed a lot. For good. To be honest, he used to be a not-as-good kinda guy but since Candace, he's been a lot better. Stopped flirting, being *cough*, and a lot of stuff. They're crazy about each other, which is cute. So yeah. Not a bad guy after all. :)  Alice... *sighzZ* Haven't talked to her much these past few days but I hope she's doing okay. I wonder if she got to get her talk that they were supposed to have...?   Talked to Erica at recess today and yeah. I guess it's all good.  Band practise in half an hour. Nima's not coming. Cancelled out on us again but whatever. We're having it without him this time at Moca's house. He's going to Alex's birthday party.   I don't know if I'll be able to bring my keyboard for Brian but yeah. We need to work on our song for the contest.  Well, there's not much to say now... gotta run. Bye.
