(the default is 200 !!! how fast can that be... and what's worse... if i'm playing any game that have a ATB or real-time combat...with the FPS at 200... the game will be soo damn fast...)  abt the sentosa outing... heard from yin luan that maybe there will not be any overnight stay depending on the number of people wanting to stay overnight...  sianz sia... nothing to do...
