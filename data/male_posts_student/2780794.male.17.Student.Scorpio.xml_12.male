GOAL: eliminate evri1's ball while keeping ur own~  Teamwork Drill  play 3 on 3~ goals not impt~ itz how the 3 players communicate wif each other to obtain the goal~ individual skills are secondary~  Passing drills  simple pass 2 players play passing wif each other.  lob pass passing a simple chip to player wif a defender in the middle.  triangle passing keeping possession~  I guez datz all for now~ will be able to update more soon~
