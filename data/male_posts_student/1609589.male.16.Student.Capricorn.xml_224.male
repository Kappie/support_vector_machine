My mom has this thing where it's impossible for her to use it, and we tell her again and again, the nicest way possible, how to use it. We're one step short of just writing fucking instructions and stapling them to the wall. It's fucking ridiculous.  And each time she forgets how easy it is, she comes, bitchy as ever, to my dad arguing about how "i don't think it has to be that hard!" and it's always like "if there is an easier way, don't you think we would have found it by now?"  So now I'm blasting Poets Of The Fall out the door in the hopes that they'll think "Oh shit, we're arguing, and we're fucking our son up, we might just wanna shut the hell up and get over it."]  Fuck.
