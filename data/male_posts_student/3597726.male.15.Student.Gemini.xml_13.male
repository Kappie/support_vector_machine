We went to the essigs, watched paycheck, jammed, ate, jammed some more, watched spiderman, slept, watched the 'dead poetic' video, and Thomas beat me in a game of slap. Yeah. Thats what we did. Not exactly in that order, though.   Katie, Virginia, Becca, Bethany, Angela, Aaron, and Thomas and I are going to see Spiderman II tomorrow. This will be my second and LAST time. Its like one of my favorite movies, though.   man, I never realized how bad I want to be in a band till recently. Its just bveen on my mind. How I would perfect that band and shape and mold it into the ultimate band. A dream. I've been writing lyrics lately. Maybe I should post some on here...
