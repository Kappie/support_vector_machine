Most people, even if it's only for a short moment in their lives, ponder about the existance of God in some way, but never take it further, because that means they can carry on living in the comforting bubble of not worrying about that kind of thing. But it must be that in the beginning, it was evolution that started it all. Thousands of bones, the timescale in which they existed clearly identifyable through carbon dating, can be linked to the chain that leads from the primordial ooze to upright human beings,   Homo sapiens.  There are some damn funny fossils and preserved skeletons that have been discovered, which suggests either a restricted section of Eden or that Eve had some very strange ideas. Secondly, Adam had two sons, one of which murdered the other. While this is possible, it lead to the surviving son marrying. Did I miss something there? Either he was marrying his sister, of Adam and Eve wern't the first people on Earth...  With that out of the way, we can look at a far more likely story. While I do not implicitly believe in this, it makes far more sense, and takes into account the facts not known to those 2,000 years ago. At some unknown point, possibly at the time of Ardipithecus ramidus, the first Hominid (the evolution branch that split humans away from apes), our ancestors actually started  thinking  about things, like how the moon changed shape. In fact, the sky is where the first idea of an all-powerful being came into shape. Much, much later down the evolutionary line, we started thinking that someone  up there  was in control. Things like the moon, the sun and the stars were clearly ordered. They were things you could set your stone circle by. whereas down here was chaotic and unpredictable. So maybe an appeal could be made? Maybe some of the order  up there  could be filtered down to here, if He who was in control was pleased enough? Then, add years and years of tribal mythology, wise men, holy men, priests, factions of religions being created and destroyed and running together again and finally, you arrive at the creation of Chistianity. Yes, I skipped a few important chapters there. But you still get the general idea. If you don't, you shouldn't be reading this.  Anyway, there are other theological arguments against God, certainly a benevolent one, which just shows some people are never happy. If He's so kind, then, why does he allow earthquakes and such to happen to really poor parts of the world? To which the supporters reply, God tests us. Hah, says the athiest, what about babies who die at birth, who havent got the  ability  to be tested?   God moves in mysterious ways, the supporters reply, sweating a bit now. Oh, I  see , says the athiest. So God somehow turns the truama and suffering of stillborn babies into a kind and benevolent act, does he? Just have faith, comes the reply, always a good quote in an emergency. Well I'm sorry, says the athiest, it doesnt quite cut the mustard for me. Oh yeah, so you would rather believe in a load of excuses made by scientists who can't really explain all the answers yet, then? And so the debate goes on. I've really read too many of the wrong books to believe in the existance of God now, but it leaves me with the worrying feeling that I'm totally insignificant, that when I die I will leave nothing but decomposing matter, that there is nothing beyond the stars other than the endless void of space. Maybe it is better to believe in God.
