I don't think there is anyone quite like him anywhere, ever.   Psychotic, honorable, destructive, creative, independent, hard working, ambitious, loving father, traditional, innovative, at once respectful and dissrespectful and apparently a trustworthy friend.  He's an enigma, and it is no wonder that his bikes are famous, his TV shows are a hit and he's become a counter-culture celebrity. He just fascinates the hell out of me, and the sheer uniqueness of the man makes for extremely riveting TV.
