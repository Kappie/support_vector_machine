I loved being in Albany.. even though my luck up there wasn't always good.. i really did have the time of my life up there... i saw things that you could only see on TV.. i experienced things that most people don't experience...  I came back home to Rockland and i missed Albany.. some of my friends all of a sudden felt like strangers to me.. over time i strengthened relationships with all of my friends and made new ones.. i had a fucking blast down here and home really feels like home again.. things are really getting fun here, but now i have to leave again...  I'm going to miss you all.. but as our Arnold says.. "I'll be back!"
