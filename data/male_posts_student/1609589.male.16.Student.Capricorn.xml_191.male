It's too bad i don't really feel "in tune" with my family, because i'm athiest and they're all right-wing.  1 minute left.  My parents dont want me to tell them, but i do, but then again, i dont know how I would pull it off, so it can wait.  But, my parents have decided not to tell me what we're doing for thanksgiving tommorrow.  Happy thanksgiving.  If we have to wake up at 7:00 and drive 2 hours to my grandparents house, i'm gonna be pissed because i don't have any "grandparent" clothes. You know them. The kind that you wear when you see your grandparents.  Even if you dont have them, you know what they are. about 3 steps below "sunday school suits."  Suddenly, it smells like my grandparent's caddilac in here. Maybe it's the cat.  Happy minute-into-thanksgiving.
