Though they made a very generous offer, Jason and I have decided that Brite Divinity is going to be the best place for me to finish my Masters in Theology.  So, I called today and accepted their full tuition scholarship award!  I am overwhelmingly happy to know where I will be finishing this degree.  With this new future, I can completely put the ACU issues behind me and move on!  Thank you all again for all your prayers about this.  ...And since Brite is a Disciples of Christ school...go DISCIPLES!  :)
