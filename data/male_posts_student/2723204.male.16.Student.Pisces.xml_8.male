Sometimes, I don't know even what you think of me just as a friend, just friends. Don't be afraid to burden me with your problems, don't be afraid to tell me what really bugs you, I will never be burdened. Indeed, you have hurt me in the past, but I do not mind. Sometimes when I see you looking down, feeling sad, I really want to comfort you and I hope to share this sorrow and burden with you, but I can't do that, I can't, really. To me, now, the most precious thing I can possibly have is never money, nor anything fancy, but really, is conversations with you. And I can honestly say that whether I feel happy, sad or angry, in short, my moods, are almost entirely dependent on you. Distance, I don't know if it makes the heart grow fonder or not, but what I know is that distance has caused much sorrow for me.
