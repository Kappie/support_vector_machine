The politicians pretend that they are astute, god fearing christians (or muslims, or jews, or hindus depending on area) because it keeps us peons in line. They expect their citizens to be good little cult fanatics and do what God says and to follow the rules, otherwise we will burn in hell forever. Of course, most leaders themselves don't really believe in this archaic crap, but it looks good in the public's eyes since we've had it shoved down our throats for so long. And it comes in handy for starting wars too. The now popular Jihad is one example,the crusades an older example. Bush says he does what Jesus tells him to. The anti-communist and anti-anarchist feeling in America I'm sure has as much to do with religion as it does with the political system. "What, the commies don't believe in God? Oh my, they are evil satan-loving fools!" And seperation of church and state is a joke. Homosexual marriage is boycotted because the religious right says that God hates gays.Stem cell research is eliminated because its wrong to use fetuses to save lives, because of how sacred life is, (forget the death penalty though, death row inmates arent sacred, only some people are.) "In God We Trust," the state decides for us that we believe in God. Total Bullshit. It makes me so mad, and to think that I used to be a good little Christian. Fucking depressing. I'm ranting, aren't I?     We are not good and we are not free if we do things because we are told to and because we fear. We are only good human beings when we do things out of compasion and because we want to do them. Taking orders from some supreme being is even more ridiclous then obeyeing other human beings in the form of the boss and the Government. Religion makes Government easier to swallow.     Bakunin once said,"The first revolt is against the supreme tyranny of theology, of the phantom of God. As long as we have a master in heaven, we will be slaves on earth." This more or less sums up anything I can say on the matter. We need to look for heaven on earth and we need to be our own gods and we need to follow our own, personal ideas.      No Gods, No Masters!
