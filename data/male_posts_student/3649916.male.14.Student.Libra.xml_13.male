And yesterday it was thunder and lightning out so cable crashed and i could not post.  Today was awesome.  I was at home on my thief until like dinner time around and then i went out with my friends the river.  Me , Russell, Johanna, and robert.  We all hung out at the river it was awesome, i mean how could it not.  The only bad thing about it was the fact that we did not have a fire because all firewood was damp from rain.  We then went to russells ate a little and i went home.  When i got home i macroed in UO and did nothing else.  At the moment i am macroing mining so i will get enough ingots to fill bods that i have.  2400 so far yay lol.  I cannot wait for tomorrow i will finally get chance to get ouw tith robert, and others in the middle of the day because today i left house at 6:30, and tomorrow i will leave in morning hehe. I didnt do much in UO maybe a little stealing i dont really remember.  But yesterday i stole another house and loved it hehehehehe.  I cannot wait to go out.  I may go on a 10 day trip to Las vegas and california with my mom, her friend, her friends daughter, her friends daughters friend, me, and my sis hehe.  It will be kinda uncomfortable sharing a room with a girl but oh well i will still masturbate hahahahaha.  Well i am going to goto bed now i am exhausted, talk to you in the morning.  Chris
