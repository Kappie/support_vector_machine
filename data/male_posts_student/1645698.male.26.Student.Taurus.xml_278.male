Didn't think I'd get even this far, and even if I don't get much beyond this, I'd have to give thanks for just the will, the fuel to get to this point. That's you dollface, even if all this college stuff doesn't get me anywhere, getting here was enough, and I supose I did it. Thanks for that, regardless of whether or not you think you did anything to contribute to it, I remember you have. Besides, we all see things the way we want to see them, isn't that so? Anyway...     Blandest  (Everything 3x altogether)  You're my favorite Of my saviours You're my favorite Oh no  Yes you're my favorite Of my favors You're my razor Oh no  Hey! And the situation wasn't quite As intense as I thought I need you around To remind me what not to become And the situation wasn't quite As intense as I thought I need you around To remind me when not to be calm Calm, calm, calm    Besides that, there's nothing. I'm Deadinside, I feel the sickness.  "When I was 13, my grandmother killed herself because I was ugly. When I was 14, my grandfather killed himself because I was ugly..."
