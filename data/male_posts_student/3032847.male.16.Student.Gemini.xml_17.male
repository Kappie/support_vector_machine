I managed to squeeze in some Biology revision yesterday- and considerin I slept for less than two hours last nite/this morning, I think I did quite well on my Geo and Bio exams! Several brews with 2 teabags in kinda perk you up a bit :-)  Sight of the day: Going to Lukes with Dave in-between exams, his faulty house alarm was going off and a copper came on a BIKE! A normal bike- with 'Police' written on the cross-bar! Well done mate for setting the eco-friendly example with your oversized helmet...  But to more grim news... IT exam in the mornin- haven't revised, don't need to, but more to the point is I've also got the Non-Calculator Maths Paper :-(. Let's just say I've never revised so hard in my life in one night, thanks grandad for helpin me go through stuff- but now I've sat down here I can't remember a THING :-0 im just gonna hope that it's all easy stuff that I can do. I need a B to do what I want at college :-( (chemistry, physics, (therefore A-level maths is needed.. but I wont need it for Photography)!  It makes me feel a whole lot better that people I've asked (well, Elliot and Jamie) havn't  revised for tomorrow. Luke hasn't, much. He dosen't need to :-@. Wish I revised for maths ages ago :-( !  Looka this- all I've talked about is exams. Thrilling eh? It's as thrilling as my next few weeks are gonna get...  Elliot- when you read this I just want to tell you that- giving up meat? INSANE! Hey, I've been in a chicken farm and they don't decapitate chickens, they break the neck in-between the index and middle fingers, and the thumb! Hmm.. they still move around for a while though, it's kind of strange and perculiarly funny... and I bet there was meat extracts in most things you ate this week, anyway :-)
