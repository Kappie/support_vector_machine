Although I am not nearly knowledgeable enough about legal matters to give this any kind of proper analysis, it does seem to be as the article suggest in that the ruling is fairly narrow and doesn't address the case of separation of church and state.   However, at the  urlLink Volokh Conspiracy  (a law professor group blog) they have this to say: Some will say, "Rats, too bad the Court didn't squarely reaffirm the constitutionality of the 'under God' Pledge." Others may say, "Too bad the Court didn't strike it down." Others might say, "Good thing that the Court is taking procedural requirements like this seriously." Others will say, "Well, at least they didn't affirm 'Under God' on the merits, thereby creating a lousy precedent that we'd be stuck with." Others might say other things.  What all of those mean I have no idea - but there you are.  In a response to Matt I also suggested that if you take out the "under God" portion of the pledge, you'd also have to change all of our money as well as the state seals and mottos of half the states. Another issue I hadn't thought of was also brought up at the  urlLink Volokh Conspiracy :   In the wake of the L.A. County seal controversy, some people (including me) have given city names as an analogy -- city names such as "Los Angeles," "Sacramento," "Corpus Christi," "Providence," and the like are religious references, the argument goes, but surely we shouldn't hold them to be an Establishment Clause violation, even if one accepts that the Establishment Clause generally bars government speech that a reasonable, knowledgeable observer would see as an endorsement of religion. Why? Because city names are not seen today as endorsements of religion, but just as reflections of the nation's history. Likewise, the argument goes, with the cross on the L.A. county seal.  But the city name issue, it turns out, is not just a hypothetical. In the early 1990s, James O'Leary sued the County of Sacramento, complaining that the county's seal contained the religious term . . . "Sacramento." In the words of the Ninth Circuit memorandum in this case,  O'Leary alleged that the County of Sacramento's ("County") use of the "sacred holy name (Sacramento) on their county seals have caused him to suffer anger, shame, fright, humiliation, mental anguish, emotional distress and physical distress," forcing him to "go 'underground' with his Christian religion."  The court rejected O'Leary's claim on procedural grounds.   So, the issue is a little larger than just state seals, mottos and money. But for some the scope isn't the issue - it is the issue itself. Religion and the term God must be erased from all public record no matter what the cost.    I am curious what is so "wrong" about having the words "under God" in the pledge? Or, for that matter, what is the basis of the impetus to remove religion and God from every aspect of public life? Where do you draw the line - where does it end? Do we stop with official (by which I mean state-sponsored) realms, or continue on to all public realms (which some are trying to do)?
