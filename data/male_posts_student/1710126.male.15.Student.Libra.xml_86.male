I think tt is what is important. Its hard to cope with my work, but it'll be over soon.   Got music theory exam comin up this sat, dunno if i can pass coz got no time to study...if fail my parents will be so dissapointed and wasted all tt money...then if i channel my energy to the exam my schoolwork will suffer...in anycase i am not gonna be able to do well for the next two tests, maths and physics, and my theory exam.   had migraine, but took two panadol pills...so feeling betta now. Muz start work oredy. I hope i can sleep early tonite, or i'll fall sick soon and wun b able to concentrate in school tomorrow. Its so hard being active in school and scoring well in ur subjects as well. No wonder they have the president's scholar thingy...the scholars totally deserve it, they can balance so much stuff at once...and i m oredy dying...
