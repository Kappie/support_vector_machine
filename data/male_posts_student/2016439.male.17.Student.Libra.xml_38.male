Finally, after what seems like many months (it's only been a couple) of long nights, endless playbacks, and endless fixings, my pride and joy is ready to be played.  I've been handing out the parts for the last week or so, and I'm glad to say that people are excited to play in my lil' Ensemble That Could ;-)  It's great to know you have friends, you know?  I mean, this year, I've made more friends through band as drum major than I ever could have imagined.  Robert and Hillary, my fellow drum majors, have been so much fun to work with, and getting to know and work with the band has been a great experience.  No wonder I'm seriously considering the music education profession, eh?  Yeah, well...we'll see ;-)  My rough draft for  The Echo  is due tomorrow, and I haven't even lined up the four interviews for my article.  Isn't that bad?  I have so much fun in that class.  There are only six full-time staff members, and it's great.  I seriously could go all day just in that class.  Mrs. B is great.  I should be reading Death of a Salesman right now, but I'm so lazy, and procrastinating is so much more fun, right?  Actually, I'm thinking about going and working in my Italian book.  Il mio italiano Ã¨ malo, mai...yeah, so I have a ways to go, hehe.  Between that, French, Spanish, and even my own native love English, my tongue's been working overtime and without pay, too.  Hehe, gotta luv it.  Life is good, all is well, amen.  Philip
