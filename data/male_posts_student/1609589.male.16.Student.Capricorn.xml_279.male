I mean- not stoning Jesus to death rock- it's going to be so awesome.  My cousin is a pimp guitaristzor, and he's really good at picking up stuff- making him perfect for the job (also because he only has to play 3 notes pretty much)  We're performing Drumbone for the youth service- AJ will be the drummer, Sarah(who is our awesome 3rd drumboner) will be in the middle, and I'll be the one doing the hard and tiring sliding at the end.  Also! I found out that I can play Above on my dulcimer, so if they need any filler, AJ (who can play drums pretty well) and I (dulcimer) can sync the song to a CD. We might replace Mad World, our ending song, because everybody seemed iffy about that song, due to it being verrrrry depressing.  Well, the instruments I ordered are effectively destroyed in my life- i paid the guy, but then it turned out that shipping would be 900 dollars. 900 dollars is a piece of crap, it doesn't HAVE to be shipped freight- they could put the shit in a suburban with all the instruments, and make it down here in 12 hours.  /sigh.  Oh well.  Thing is, cons (failing english, not getting instrument) pretty much outweigh the pros (youth service youth service YOUTH SERVICE!11!), but i'm still happy.  EDIT: Turns out, neither AJ, Sarah or I will be able to do the youth service.  Luckily, we did have a good substitute, the Blue Man Group. I hope they know how to do this stuff.
