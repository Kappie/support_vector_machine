Mat had a very interesting theory for me to completely destroy this morning: "Why do we need minus numbers? Couldn't we just shift the number line down a bit instead?" It took me from his house right over to that postbox on Midland Way to explain why it was such a crazily stupid idea. Which probably comes to between 5 and 10 mins. I'm not really sure.  And I can't think of much else to say now. Bah.
