At one point Arthure realizes that his idea at at first of "The Knights of the Round Table" was brilliant at the start. His idea of using might to bring justice, and make things right. And so they did. They used might to make things right. Only problem was after they had righted everything that was wrong, his knights had only been trained to go about using might on everything. And so because of this, they were never trained to have a spiritual sense, so might began to be released within the round table itself. Knights within the table avenged the family title for the Orkney's, and it went on. When Arthur realized this, he had to make a change, it only seeming as the sensible thing to do.  Well now, I too realize that I haven't exactly been going about doing things right. When it used to come to helping ppl, I would always become emotionally attatched, seeing as how it would be the only way to keep myself calm*as well as the other person(s)* and try to fix what was wrong. Problem? You get fed up of bein pissed off , or worried, or just depressed half the time. So you go off on a quest to find friends, 75% of them only being temporary. You find these friends and what do you do? You stick with them until you find the few who bring you happiness in life. You manage this, and when you've achieved that happiness, you almost completely abandon your most important morals only becaue you don't wanna return to a life of misery despite the fact that the misery was only to help heal. So you end up almost completely abandonning your most prized morals, and when you realize it, you're complete ashamed of yourself.  Yes, that pretty much explains my story over the past two years. So I guess now I have to something similar to what Arthur decides to do, or more like the idea that Lancealot suggests. Lancealot has the idea of sending the knights on a quest for the holy grail. This way they will achieve a better spiritual sense. So I guess now, I have to go on some type of "quest" to figure out a solution to what it is I am to do.  Other than that, besides that I have less than 200pages left in the book, as well as I am *was when this was written* bored, I don't there's anything left to say.
