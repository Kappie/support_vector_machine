It seems that the proud Russian tradition of sacking high-ranking officers and military advisers lives on. After all, it was Stalin who eliminated the entire command structure of the armed forces just years before the second World War.  Let's just hope that this isn't a bad omen. World War III coming out of the conflict in Chechnya? And here I've been ranting about the  urlLink Taiwan Straits issue  for all this time.
