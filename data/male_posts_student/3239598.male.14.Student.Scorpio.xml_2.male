Now, it wasn't that bad, but I really didn't do anything.  I was up early and almost fell asleep on the bus (which was the best part).  And, my contacts hurt.  MIchael and I are talking about bubbly.  I'm not sure why though.  I think it's because of the launch of the new blogger and I saw the headline and I just decided to talk about that.  I don't DRINK the bubbly, but it's fun to pop the corks.  I shot myself in the foot once though.  That hurt.  I really don't have anything incredibly amusing or exciting to say here right now.  I'm just writing for the sake of writing.  So I'll wrap it up here.  Thank you and goodnight!  ~JACK SPARROW~
