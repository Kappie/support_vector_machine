I've been talking to two people, and it seems that they're pretty angry at another person (I will not use specifics in this), and this troubles me.  I, in my altruism, inherently worry about people.  There was a bit of drama concerning these three, and I thought it was all resolved, but it seems that the sparks are flaring up again, and of course, I'm worried.  I just can't bear to think about this all starting up again, everything was supposed to be fine since the resolution of their problems, but I truly feel that unless something happens, this harbinger of war, will bring us all to a bane of troubles.  Let's just hope that things work out well.
