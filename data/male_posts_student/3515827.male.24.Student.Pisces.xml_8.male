Instead, it's as if it just took place and no one is sure what really happened and who did what.   Frankly I expect more fromthe former National Security Advisor to Clenis. Yes, they are only copies of the original documents, documents that he probably helped create. And on can argue that maybe because of this, Berger, in a lapse of judgment, didn't see it as a violation to walk out with them. But that excuse is simply not good enough. "Mybad" doesn't cut it when you are at his level.   But I refuse to believe that he hide documents in his socks. That is completely absurd.As for the individuals that work at the Archives who reported that is what they saw, why didn't CNN question them.    CNN : So you witnessed Sandy Berger remove documents from the Archives?   ANON : Yes, he stuffed some papers in his jacket, pants, and socks.   CNN :You mean he placed papers in his pockets and what he couldn't fit there he rolled up his pants leg, pulled back his socks, and crammed what he could there as well?   ANON : Yeah, pathetic isn't it, he must have really wanted to hide something bad.   CNN : Well, I suppose so. If I saw him do this it would really make me wonder what would make him go to such lengths to hide. Didn't you wonder, didn't it make you raise your eyebrows?   ANON : Yes, very much so. His actions were near treason.   CNN : And you just let him walk out the door, after watching him stuff his pockets?   ANON:  Yes.   CNN : And socks?   ANON : Well, um, yes.   CNN : And it didn't occur to you to call security then, to stop him at the door?   ANON : Um, well.......   CNN : Well, why didn't you stop him?   ANON : Well, because I'm a douchbag.   This is why I hate reporters. They want a lead so bad, they talk to anyone and print anything. No matter how stupid it sounds, no questions asked.   This is why I hate reporters. They are all douchbags.
