Probably because I'm in the process of making arrangements with the  urlLink Jewish Community of Japan  to accomodate my trip to Japan that coincides with Passover.  But once again I feel the urge to convert and become a real Jew. To get really serious. I don't know. Maybe I'm just obsessive. (What? No way!)  I really wish Foothill-De Anza really taught Hebrew like they claim too. I sent an e-mail to Foothill asking if there are any third-party organizations that teach Hebrew that they will give Foothill credit for. But then there is the whole issue with whether UCs would accept that class. I would take the class anyways though.  In my dreams I'm bilingual.
