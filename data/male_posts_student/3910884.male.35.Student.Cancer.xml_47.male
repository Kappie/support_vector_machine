I spoke with the curator and one of the artists at length and discussed the visual arts program he is running. We had a few beers and we discussed Filipino politics and discussed my views about what being Filipino is about from a FilAm point of view (ie. the fractured culture, resilient culture, and search for cultural identity being difficult when Filipinos in the Philippines can't define it themselves). It was very entertaining to say the least.   I mentioned the importance of art and applauded them on their effort since for me, art is a tool and/or method for describing issues of social justice such as identification, feelings, and possibly answers. People tend to be visual and like the saying goes, 'a picture paints a thousand words.' So I'm very excited to see the exhibit on 7/15 particularly since the art will be by local Kampapangan artists. Also included in the exhibit will be music and poetry reading by local artists and of course food will be served (what Filipino celebration would be complete without food!?). I was even asked to participate by including my own artwork. I scoffed at the idea since I'm not really an artis (Mylene is the artista, not me, I wish she could go, she would have enjoyed this immensely!). Anyways, I promised to write some haiku's on Filipino life and scenes so let's see how that turns out. I'll post the haiku's at a later date.
