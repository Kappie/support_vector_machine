I always seem to get depressed on cloudy and rainy days...  Grandma and Grandad are buying me a new MP3 Player for a very early birthday present.  They're so great, without them I'd be travelling everywhere and going to sleep without a single note of music :(  School is just around the corner and I can't wait to get back (OF COURSE I'm being sarcastic!).  Sometimes I wish I could just wake up and be somewhere else.  Speaking of which, we better get approved soon so I can finally start crossing off the days.  Waiting is painful...
