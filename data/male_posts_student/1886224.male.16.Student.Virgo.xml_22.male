Yesterday I had to umpire a little league game and boy did that sucked. I thought it was gonna be a short, continuation game. No, it wasn't. The score was tied and people were getting frustrated at my strike zone. The fucking coach said I was "terrible". FUCK YOU! God, were you behind the plate asshole? Is it my fault your pitcher throws balls 10 feet above the batter and into the dirt. God, you have got to be fucking kidding me. Ahhh, now that's off my chest, I have some good news! The O'Connor Road block party is tomorrow night but I have a baseball game. I probably can hang out before than and get back in time after my game. Batting .333 on the year. Pretty happy about that!  And for the big news! Next Thursday I'm leaving to Hungary to see some family. At first I was pretty bummed to go back there but now I'm alright with it. So there won't be any updating from July 29th to August 8th I believe.
