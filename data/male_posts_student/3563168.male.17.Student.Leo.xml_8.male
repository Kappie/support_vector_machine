Actually, they rock starting Sunday evenings with "The Simpsons", but night time is funner to watch TV, because you know you're not missing anything.  I usually start at 10 p.m. watching either Fox 4's sports show, or a rerun of "The Simpsons". Whichever is better. Then I go to channel 4 to watch Seinfeld. Man that show rocks.  After an hour of that, I sometimes watch "Dharma and Greg" even though it's not always that great. Either that or more sports shows.  At 12 a.m. I go to channel 11 to watch this dumb show call "Unexplained Mysteries". It's so stupid, because it always talks about either psychics, ghosts, healers, or aliens. Either way, it's still interesting seeing all the dumb talk.  At 1 a.m. one of the best shows man has ever known comes on. "Walker, Texas Ranger". Holy shit, that show rules so much. I mean, Chuck Norris kicks ass like there's no tomorrow. Not to mention that he was also a 6 time karate world champion. If that doesn't kick ass, then I don't know what does.    "Chuck Norris: a total badass."  2 a.m. is generally when I take a shower.  2:30 is when I watch "Hot Ticket", even though I hate movie critics. They're never right because the movies they say are good usually suck ass, and the movies they say are bad usually kick ass. However, they usually talk about movie history, so it's interesting.  That's why Sunday nights kick ass.
