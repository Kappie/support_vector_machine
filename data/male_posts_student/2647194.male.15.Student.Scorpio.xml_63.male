Well, ok, so I only know 1 of those people, but Jamie wanted them to come.  A few people that did show up (like everyone else should have done): Amanda Dylan Matt (from Chops) Sam Matt (Moris) Parents, and siblings of band members  It wasn't as packed as it could have been, but oh well. There's always the Spring Concert next week, the MCTC concert for the RANDOM next week, and the RANDOM at MOA next week!!!! *hint hint*  An answer to some of the people who ask me, "Are you in a band or something? Because you really should be."  Yes, I am in a band that plans to rehearse this summer, and should be quite good-we've actually got talented people, unlike other "garage" bands...  The no-name-yet band includes: Amanda Olson: lead guitarist, band leader, lyricist, lead singer Dylan: rhythm guitarist Will Grant: Bass Mitch Ogaard: Drums Brendan Murphy (me): pianist, back-up singer, composition Emily Olson: manager Editting *unverified*: Bryan Neilson  Now all we have to do is to get everyone in the same room at the same time, with or without the instruments. Preferably with.  As you can see, that whole band is pretty talented. Should be great-and maybe we'll be good enough to be the guest band at the next Jazz Coffeehouse. ZAM wasn't the most, erm, interesting band I've ever heard.  A small recap: Math: Woohoo! I jumped, blindfolded, and caught on to the "math train" again. I lost it for a day, but I found it. Crap. I still have homework that I'm not doing tonight.  Science: did an assignment  Band: threw Splanky out the window, prepared for the concert  Spanish: assignment  English: stuff  Social: stuff  Notice the quick recap-I have to go before my mom refuses to take me to the Chops concert!!!! Oh no!!  Yeah, I gotta run. No lyrics tonight, because I like what I used last night. And the night before, and the night before that...
