The facilitator is Raja Shamri bin Raja Husin from Golden Mind Consultant, Kota Bharu which is the panel motivator for MRSM. Program starts at 8:30 a.m and ends at 4:30 p.m.  The facilitator is top-notch, he have been able to make us stay alert all the way through. Although using a prosthethic leg, he is as active as a spinning top. He treats us as we were his younger brothers and sisters, different from other facilitaors which act like uncles lecturing his nephews and nieces. A really brilliant student himself, he shared with us his experience and confide to us that we could be a succesful man like him - 28-years-old, 3 degrees, 3 companies, 18 staffs, and still single.   And I wanted to be much better than him. :-)  BTW, those who wanted to contact him can call or SMS at 013-9617103
