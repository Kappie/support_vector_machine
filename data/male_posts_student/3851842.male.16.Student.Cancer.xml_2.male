A hope that fades each single day.   The hope of going back to the Philippines this July 9, 2004. In just a brief momment my anticipation ended and my hope shattered and replaced with feelings of devastation and abhorrence.   I am faced with the fact that I will not be going home this week!   This occurence didn't abate my determination, instead it grew more indomitable than ever.   I will go home!
