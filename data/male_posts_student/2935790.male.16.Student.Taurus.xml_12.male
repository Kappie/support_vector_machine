For those of you who didn't recognize the title of this post, I'm talking about Jim Carrey's new movie  Eternal Sunshine .  I'll start by rating it.  4 trillion trillion trillion TRILLION stars / 5.  It is truly the work of geniuses, namely;  Charlie Kaufman  - Writer/Producer of  'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', 'Adaptation', and 'Human Nature'.   The guy is 130% genius.  Michel Gondry  - Writer/Director of  'The Science of Sleep' and 'One Day...'.   Awesome guy.  Pierre Bismuth  - Helped out with  'I've Been Twelve Forever' , which all three men worked on...   My crappy synopsis:  Lacuna Inc. has this technology that erases bad memories, and all it really takes is one night of being hooked up to a machine where they track down the memories in your brain and erase them one by one.  Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) is an astoundingly complex introverted character, kinda shy, kinda funny.  He meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) in Montauk (sp?) and they kinda flirt, even though she's a nut.  "Why does he fall in love with every girl that shows him the least bit of attention?"  Anyways, they go out, and get in fights because Clem is a h00r, so Clem erases Joel from her memory.  Joel accidentally finds out and gets pissed, so he erases goes to Lacuna to erase her from  his  memory.  Still with me?  The majority of the movie is after all this; it takes place in Joel's mind where it goes back memory by memory, erasing Clem step by step from his mind, and the whole time Joel is living out his mind, watching the memories get erased.  As they are being erased, Joel realizes that he really loves Clem, and changes his mind about wanting her erased.  Twist?  He can't get out; he's hooked up to this crazy contraption all night and can't escape (or can he?).  So in his mind, he tries to avoid the Lacuna workers and protect his memories of Clem by burying her deeper and deeper in his memories, and they travel all the way to his childhood and back.  That's about all I can say without spoilers, all though I'm sure that wasn't exactly spoiler-free.  The movie is so good.  When we walked out of the dark theatre back into the hall, Ryan kinda looked shocked, and I sure as hell was.  I don't think we were capable of mentally classifying what we just watched, we just knew it kicked ass (Ashworth and Spence seemed a bit too confuzzled...).  The movie flicks back and forth between scenes quickly sometimes, so confusion is understandable, but when the rush dies down a bit the scenes blend a lot more, and there's definitely a visual flow that goes with it.   If you haven't seen the movie yet, go see it before you read the following.   I love how they do things like the store blending into the apartment room, and the barbed-wire type fence in his room to switch from one scene to another closely related scene, it's pure genius.  One of my favorite scenes overall is the Kitchen scene (in his mind).  It's so complex because Clem is acting 'normal', trying not to be noticed, but  really , that is Joel, because she is just composed of his memories.  I find it amazing how his childhood memories lull him into repeating actions like getting the cookie and reaching for ice cream, yet his mind manages to recreate Clem's character on a completely different train of thought, all entirely possible and the multitasking type stuff like that is just cool.  It's like a form abstraction; you can see something from a couple viewpoints at a time.  If something like that were pulled off in any other movie, you wouldn't feel the characters' emotions at all, that's one of this movie's strongest features.  The funniest scene would definitely have to be the childhood memory of the bullies, the one with the hammer and he's wearing a cape and stuff.  It was refreshing to see Joel's character played by a boy for a second, and after it switches back to him wearing the cape and he tries to fight the kid, he remembers the guy as a bully so he is still tossed down, even though he's like thrice his size.  It's done so well, and I can't picture watching it being filmed on set without pissing myself.  I also love the scene in town where his memories get mixed up, if I remember correctly it's about the first time you hear the Lacuna workers, Patrick and Stan, talk and their voice is subliminally heard and Joel hears it blasted throughout the streets of his mind.  Crazy concepts in this movie, I'd like to see anyone who owns a gat wrap their mind around it, or any comic book loving 4 year-old try to sit through it without reading his latest issue of Inquest.   I love this movie.
