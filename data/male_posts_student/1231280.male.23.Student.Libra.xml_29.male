I'm not trying to set myself up for disaster  though, either. I'm gonna take this thing slow. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be. If not - it's not. we'll see how the next few weeks turn out. Just take it one day at a time. She's the only thing in my life right now that is good. Everything else is shit. Maybe she came into my life for a reason. We'll find out. Anyways, peace out - we'll talk to ya all tomorrow.
