All i really learned is that Italians are crazy drivers and greek people all have "good deal for you" and of course it's "all top quality". as with all trips it never goes all to plan, like for instance me losing my ticket at 4 in the morning at the airport...only to find it half an hour later on the sidewalk outside. then of course there were the constant pickpocketings, muggings (actually this only happened once...well not really...they tried to pick his pocket and he kicked the crap out of 'em) then losing one person in the subway and the stuck up whiney girls bitching about how they won't get to go shopping now, fuck 'em! then the whole incident in the club, and out of the club, when one person in our group got drunk took off out the window and fell 15ft onto his head, and the police wouldn't touch him because if he attacked them they'd shoot him...i love greek police. no i don't...and i hate the italian ones even more, they were everywhere dammit! on every street! and i hatethe breakfast there too! who the fuckeats only a slice of sick tasting bread for breakfast??? i'll bitch more later but for now...i sleep! -Matt
