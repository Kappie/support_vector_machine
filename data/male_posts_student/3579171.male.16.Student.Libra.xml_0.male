After reading in someone else's blog that nice guys only like the bitchy sluts who take advantage of them, how there are many fake nice girls that put their nice guy friends through torture, and how nobody thinks of the genuine nice girls, I realized a few things.  First of all, I think I speak for all the nice guys out there when I say that all nice guys are stupid.  We can't tell if the bitchy sluts are acting or not.  They could be the worse actors in the world and we couldn't tell if that was the real them or just a bad performance.  Second, there are people that think about the nice girls, which is why I am writing this post right now... What? There's nothing else I wanted to mention before I get into the meat of the update.  I'm not going to deny that the nice guys always like the bitchy sluts, we do always like them.  So your thinking, "Are there really nice girls out there?"  Well, of course.  They're the girls that only like the hunky jocks who take advantage of them.  They're the one's that get put through torture by the many fake nice guys which are hunky jocks.  They're the ones that always finish second to first.  They already have several innate advantages: They don't have to act to be nice and every guy, no matter how gay, will always be attracted to a nice girl.  Even though they have these advantages, they have one major flaw that will make them always finsh in second place: Just like nice guys, they are too shy to tell the hunky jock that they obsess over and stalk that they like him.  The other bitchy slut will always get the hunky jock before the nice girl.  Even if the nice girl gathered enough courage to tell the hunky jock that she likes him, the hunky jock will just say the six dread words that every nice guy and girl despises: "I just want to be friends."  But, no matter what happens, the hunky jock will always come back to the nice girl because the nice girl is his "friend."  Before I go, I want to present the nice girl version of the unspoken, until now, unwritted rules.  These set of rules are somewhat original,they have never been seen by the general public.  Here they are:  Do  fantasize about telling him your deepest feelings towards him, prompting him to reveal similar feelings towards you, upon which the two of you will immediately engage in passionate and fulfilling lovemaking.  Do  not actually do this.   Do  listen to entirely too many sappy love songs, especially R where almost every song is about a women who can't get any loving.  Do  paste the lyrics to those songs in your AIM profile or online journal where nobody will ever read them, but do it anyway becasue you "love" him and want people to know with out actually telling them.  Do not  actually sing these songs to him, as your voice is terrible.   Do  alienate the rest of your friends when they become concerned about your depression. Pretend that your problems aren't about a guy, even though they are because you would rather have him than all of your friends combined.   Do  drive him around everywhere when he needs to run errands even though you are really busy and will get expelled/fired from school/work.  Do  let him tell you that "you're such a nice girl."  Do not  wash your car after he sits in it.   Do  do bad in your math and physics classes so you can spend all your free time letting a stupid hunky jock tutor you.  Do not  learn the material, even if he isn't in your class, so that he can tutor you and you have an excuse to be with him.  Do  have a hidden agenda that you will never get to.  Do  fantasize about telling him your deepest feelings towards him as he is trying to tutor you, prompting him to reveal similar feelings towards you, upon which the two of you will immediately engage in passionate and fulfilling lovemaking.  Do not  actually expect that to happen because it will not.  Do  start sweating and gibbering like an idiot anytime you're around him because you are a sweaty, gibbering idiot.    Do  listen to him tell you about a great girl he just met.   Do  listen to him complain about his bitchy slut of a girlfriend the next day.  Do  listen to him tell you that he wishes she was more like you.  Do  tell her that everything will work out between him and his bitchy slut of a girlfriend.  Do  shred your intestines by swallowing a chainsaw afterwards.   Do  realize that there is a difference between a nice girl and a pansy.  Do not  realize that you are definately a pansy.    Do  attempt to forget about him. Avoid him as much as possible and never initiate conversation with him.  Do  hate it when he actually tries to talks to you, preventing you from forgetting about him.   Do  write a  horrendously  long Xanga/Blogspot entry detailing your experiences with your platonic friend. Use sarcasm in an attempt to hide your embittered feelings, but make it clear to everyone reading that you still haven't forgotten about him.  - Some loser   Remember people don't need to think about nice girls, they always finish second to first anyway, it's not that bad.  It's better than second to last right? =P  "Nice girls finish second to first."
