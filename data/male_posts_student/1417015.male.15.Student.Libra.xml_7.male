It's times like these I wish I was "a bit of a thicky" and able to ride by on the minimum amount of work possible.  Another reason: I've had three detentions this week, all from the same guy. Incidently, he's the only teacher to ever give me any real detentions: eight in year eight, and four this year. Not sure who that says more about, really. Still, Duncan was in everyday. LOSE!!  Third reason: sleep loss is really catching up with me. I've had around 16 hours sleep all week, and I haven't got into school on time since before half-term through over-sleeping or being too tired to move.  I should probably be doing some sort of homework now, but I can't be bothered. So nyah.
