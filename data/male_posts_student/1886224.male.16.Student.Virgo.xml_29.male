Boy have I missed it. All around it was a pretty great trip. We left JFK International at around 11:20 and got to Budapest, Hungary at 1:30 local time. We stayed in Yugoslavia for about a week and meet up with some family. It was ok, but a little boring for the most part. My dad would talk to my relatives and old friends while I sat there doing nothing. I can't speak/talk Hungarian. After we were done seeing relatives, we went to Hungary and stayed at a 'Hotel Forras' in Szged. It was pretty cool. Nice and fancy hotel too.  We just hung out there with my aunt and uncle and kinda just toured the city. Nothing more. We left on August 8th and here I am today.  It's great to be back!
