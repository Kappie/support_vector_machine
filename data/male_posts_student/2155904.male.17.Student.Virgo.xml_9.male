But soccer was a breeze.  Pretty much a raping.  They fucked the other team.  13-1 was the final score.  Tyke had 2 goals and 2 assists and this really isn't important is it...oh well.  Well then he went to Costco with Macaroon, Tyronius, and Kinker and his parents and Tyke got a Hand Dipped Super Premium Ice Cream Bar with Almonds.  MMMMMMMM....GOOOOOOD....AHHHHH.  It was heaven-ish.  Then he went home and began down the long and winding road towards completion of the worst shaping outline that was ever forced upon a student.  It was done just 8 hours later at approximately 9:40 and that was one of the earliest times on the information super highway.  Others took quite a while to do so.  But he finished and that is all that matters.  He also went to a party for a girl and it was ok.  He lost to Skippy 105-84 in paper football but it was a great game.  Other than that he pretty much said nothing to anyone.  Ya know, his usual lonesome self.  Not that it is other people's fault for him not talking but he doesn't like having to barge in on conversations or anything like that.  He just likes to be invited or when he is really sad he likes it when someone will notice and just come up and give him a hug or come sit next to him or just smile and wink at him or something.  That makes all the difference.  Just letting someone know he cares.  He thinks he does this but he just realized that he doesn't really and he doesn't want to be hypocritical so he is going to try and show it more often.  Less jokes, more...oooo need a word that ends in -okes...hmmm...smokes?? no...hmmm...there isn't a word so it will have to be cloaks.  Less jokes more cloaks.  He still loves Tina.  Man, she's great...Even though she never called him back.  Ya know how on TV and in the movies girls always complain about how guys never call them back?  Yeah, well don't think that girls call back all the time.  Cuz they sure as hell don't.  Oh well, he isn't mad...just sad.  Tomorrow he will probably find out why she didn't call.  Maybe she was hurting.  Yeah, she did just play basketball.  Or maybe she was lying.  Or maybe she just didn't want to hang out with him and by not calling that was her way of trying to let him know that.  Awww...hopefully it is not the last one.  That one is sad.  Especially because of how much...Damn, that is sad.  Damn.  All he can think about saying to her is: "I don't know how you do what you do.  I'm so in love with you.  It just keeps getting better.  I wanna spend the rest of my life with you by my side forever and ever.  Every little thing that you do baby I'm amazed by you."
