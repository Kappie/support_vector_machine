Can't really write much today either...had to do SOO much crap today....but yeah basically the main highlight of today...civics class was kinda funny with our commercial filming, but most of all for today...  I got cut from LYS.  Least I think so....ugh I had horrible audition. I think Shaun might have done better than me even...oh well doubt either of us made it...we don't got private teachers and are tenor-clef illiterate. So yeah....now back to bio h/w.  Later.
