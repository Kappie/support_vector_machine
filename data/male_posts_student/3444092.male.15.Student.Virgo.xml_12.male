I understand that LOL may seem necessary at times, but try to use it sparingly. None of that 12/f/your room lolololololz!!!one!!!!1!!!!111!!!!one!!!! crap. We don't need that.  2) Don't fuck with the blog settings unless we agree on it. If it is something minor, go ahead. But doing something like changing the entire template should be something we decide on as a group. Other shit, I don't really care about.  3) No inviting non-Saint Mary's students to become members. This is for SM kids only. However, if you want to invite a Saint Mary's kid, go ahead.  I can't really think of anything else. If you have anything to add, by all means, go ahead.
