Blessing in disguise really since it's easier to train smaller groups.    Have to get a song called 'the APL song.' Rap song about Filipino 'ghettos.'    Here's a sort of retraction.    Seems that Pampangans  DO  yell when they speak. Usually happens between the older generations especially in the country however some older people in the city do so as well.    As it was explained to me, it's because they're showing off and want people to know they're there. They used to dress very flashy as well, wearing lots of American goods and clothes but the flashy dress doesn't happen so much since the bases are gone.    Seeing the Pilien tribal council leave is like seeing a good depart. I wish them the best of luck!
