Today Tyke got a haircut and shaved off a lot of hair and it was a perfect job too.  Absolutely no mess ups at all.  Perfect.  A little after that was the car wash and that was a lot of fun for Tyke.  Yeah, a lot of fun.  Tyke actually does wish they stayed until 4 but it was still fun while it lasted.  Then Tyke went home for a little while and bathed naked and then he put aloe all over his naked sunburnt back.  It didn't really hurt though and it still isn't too bad although right now it doesn't feel great.  He met Skippy down at Baskin Robbins and they waited about 25 seconds for Haras and she came down too.  They talked there for a while and then went up to Tibbetts.  They met Karla, Dudely Doo, and Big Poppa Booty there.  Then they went over to Jamba/Qdoba and got food there.  Then Tyke left there and went to Purdy's where he was joined by Purdy, Dotti, and Tina.  They all left and went to Jamba again for juice.  Then they went to the soccer game which was a lot of fun.  But they lost.  Then they went to Purdy's to get some supplies for the bonfire out by the lake.  Ekul and Tyke tried to get people to go skinny-dipping with them or at least tell them whether or not it was gay but they wouldn't really so it ended up fizzling.  Then he had to leave so Tyke was just funny around the fire.  He and Haras stand-cuddled for a little and then Kramm came so Kramm and Tyke cuddled.  Just kidding.  But later on they did.  But that was just a joke as well.  Haha.  Funny.  Tyke and Tina left for a little bit as well to go to Frederique's house for the cheesecake from Tolo as they wanted it.  So Tyke drove the two over there and they got it from the refridgerator and tried some of it in the garage.  It tasted funny but they still ended up eating it and bringing it back.  So they ate it there with the help of the people who were there.  Macaroon was one of them.  He played a good game today so he deserved some good cake.  But the cake wasn't that good.  So they threw it in the fire with everything else.  Oh yeah, Tyke and Tina also went to her house and got some forks which ended up being spoons and then they went into her room where the roses Tyke got for her in Freshman year for Valentine's Day (at least Tyke thinks so) were up on her wall.  That was kinda cool to see.  A little freaky cuz they were kinda dead roses hanging upside down on the wall but still really cool.  Later on Tyke was talking about them and Dudely said that they were a symbol of how Tyke was dead to her.  That was really funny Tyke thought.  But not funny cuz it's true.  Cuz it's not.  Basically today was good bonding time for Tyke and Tina.  Fun times.  After everyone left Tyke, Dudely, Big Poppa Booty, and BNelly all stayed at the fire area and talked.  For a really long time.  And saw a naked guy through his window.  And then Kramm came back too.  But they talked for a long time and about fun stuff.  It was great.  Then Tyke left and his car was wet.  He needs to wash it tomorrow.  Well, the past two days have been absolutely awesome and thanks for all those who have made that possible.  Man, this is what life should be like all the time.  Friends rule.  Thanks, yeah.
