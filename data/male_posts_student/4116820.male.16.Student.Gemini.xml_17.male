God I hate him the truth about politics is that there all liars and con artist. Your job as a voter is to find the one who lies least or keeps our economy rolling by and means necessary. I think the war in Iraq is great, we'll get cheap gas eventually. We were later playing baseball and I said "This games over once I hit a homerun." to which Kevin replied "Looks like weren't going anywhere." to which I said "Kinda like the Kerry Edwards campaign." Note that Kevin isn't even 13 years old. Other then that I skipped the fest. which was a christian gathering I volunteered for. Well lets see my excuses are no ride, no will to go, Cat wasn't going so I didn't want to. Besides I got shafted again anyway, they gave me sales and I hate selling food, crappy toys, or being some bands bitch boy.
