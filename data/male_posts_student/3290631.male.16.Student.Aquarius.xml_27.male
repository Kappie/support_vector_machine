If you would like to join the boycott, email me at angelrendon@optonline.net with your first and last name and I will add you to the list. The world has to know that there are people out there who are not going to take this shit. In the future, there will be a site dedicated to this boycott.  My second update has to do with J.D. Salinger. (The guy who wrote The Catcher in The Rye among other great things) I've been reading some more of his writing and doing some research on him and I've decided to write him a letter. He is a popular subject of fan mail because he is such a social hermit and he is such a genius at the same time.  Here is a man who could be enjoying so much fame and influence, yet he isolates himself for his own very personal reasons.  I can't help but be ultimately intrigued by his insight, life, and work.  I am going to write him a letter expressing my appreciation for his talent, and his work.  He's been known to write people back if approached politely and if he writes me back, mark my words, the letter will be framed and kept on my wall until the day I die.  That is how highly I regard Salinger.  So, here's hoping I get a reply.  I'm probably going to have my letter ready by some time next week.
