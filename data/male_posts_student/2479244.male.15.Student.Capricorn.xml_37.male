Recent events have encouraged me to do one thing: let go of my radical opinions and value all levels of intelligence, all types of ideas, all people of all backgrounds, and all music of every type, despite how honestly shitty I may want to believe it is. I've realized something, too: Every person wants to be some hot shit; some kind of prophet of originality who does what no one has done before. Sadly, there is nothing left to do. It's all been done. You cannot rebel entirely against society and still expect to be considered original. If anything, it is just this gigantic clich√©.   I used to think that I knew what was up. I used to think that I had this level of comprehension that surpassed everyone else and honestly most people have that exact same mindset. They know it all. They know the ups and downs, the ins and outs; they know the  shit . Its hard to break it to you all, but we need to get it through our heads that we are just a carbon copy of someone who died years ago.   People say that they hate our society, yet you will find them talking to all manner of people later. They say they understand elaborate topics and can give their own insight, but you could find them browsing through books or the internet for a viable opinion. They say they loathe something, but you will later see them drooling and obsessing over that very thing. Its a stage, people. Nothing more, nothing less. You are not some amazing child with these thoughts that no human being has ever thought up. You are just feeding off of what seems attractive to you at the time and you believe with all your heart that you will for the rest of your life. It is not true, and if for some completely fucked up reason it  is,  then you are a very bad soul. A person who doesn't evolve and mature and grow is nothing special. You need to actually take into account yourfolliess and your mistakes and learn from them.   It doesn't hurt to admit you're wrong, you just kind of feel like shit for a few seconds.  The only true knowledge is admitting that you know nothing. Why? Well, its simple. You keep your mind open to what will be of value to you. You are willing to take in and digest new concepts without some preconceived notion that you already understand it. Forget it. You don't know half of half of half of the things that are of value to you. If you think you'll get by with such thoughts, you are fighting an uphill battle and you are going to lose. I don't say this because I read it in some article or book. I say it because I've actually experienced this. I have heard things that were the polar opposite of my opinion that now make complete sense to me.   It sounds very typical to many people. "Quit being such a damned follower! Get your own opinion!" If you were to stand back and look at your own opinion on things, you would find that you are an easily moldable person. Your mind is this soft blob of nothing that a person with a managed brain can easily warp. Did you ever hear your parents talk about the days when they used to be rebels? Yes, its true. Much like you, they also had their blackened glory days in which society was below them. And look at them now. To you they look like a mere shell of what they once used to be. It is not true. They are far more valuable now than they used to be. They have actually experienced things and have a reason to like or dislike them. Children are just spoon-fed this by whatever television program or song they are watching or listening to.  I'm not trying to be critical about people, I'm just trying to give what I have learned to you. I don't think you can value anything you speak of until you experience it first hand. Not death, not sorrow, not happiness, not anger. But nevertheless, I respect people who think they do. Its just a stage, and I have no right to be critical of why they are acting the way they are; neither do you. You have no reason to hate the things you do. You hate them because you feel you should. Disguise it all you want. Be brave and take your steps out into the dark unknown.   But secretly, that dark unknown is only unlit because you won't open your eyes. Do it. You will be fine.
