It's rather slow going right now, because I'm still working on the background and stuff, and haven't made it to the document dissection part (which is where the real fun is).  Had to look at an awful paper when I first got in, but that's behind me now.  I think I'll be able to get this out of the way before I go home Monday.  I hope.  Well, back to work.  I want to shoot for 10 pages by the end of the night, and I have to get up early tomorrow morning and come to work.  Wee.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Van Morrison, "Cleaning Windows"
