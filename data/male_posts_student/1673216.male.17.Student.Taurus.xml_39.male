My life, as I know it, is scraping the banks of time, and always falling back into the river below. I finally find a way to proceed farther, and I just get pushed back by some force..Perhaps gravity. Damn gravity, always on the job. Anyways, that's what's up with me. I need to design a perpetual motion machine by the end of the week, by the way.. PAYING WELL!  Although the screen may be clear as crystal What's there is only an illusion The perfect world is out of your grasp It's simply not real, it can give no conclusion How can you overcome this It seems to impossible Within no one's reach..     How 'bout, a revolution?  Right.
