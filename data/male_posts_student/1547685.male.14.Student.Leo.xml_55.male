Next, we headed towards the airport and parked our car at SFO parking. Got out and went on a shuttle to the airport. Arrived there in time to jump on a direct flight to Hong Kong that lasted around 13 hours. While on board i saw 4 movies that helped me waste time and had 3 meals to eat.13 hours laterwe arrived at the HongKong airport only to find that we landed in the middle of a typhoon. (Friday-By the time we got to the airport it was already Friday) So we were delayed a little bit but eventually jumped on a bus to go to our hotel around 30 minutes away. Arrived at the hotel and unloaded all our schtuff and went outside to go to McDonalds, im loving it. So we sat there and orderd foodbut found that there wereso many different things that youcouldnt find in theStates. So after that long day we went back to the hotel to go to sleep.By the way, me and my bro had our own rooms sothat was kinda neato.   Saturday- Woke up early and then walked around until lunch time when we met up with my Dad's old roomy from St. Luis, also named Kevin,and he took us to a private club where we had dim sum, which happened to be reeeeaaaaaaally good. Then he took us to places like Victoria Peak (Highest place in Hong Kong) and Stanely Market, whichis one of the most famous areas to shop in. Victoria Peakwas so high up and really scary but a really nice view. Stanley was really big with tons andtons of shops that i shot through in like 2-3 hours. So after that we went back to his really nice apartment for dinner to see his "crib" and stuff like that. His wife and kids were'nt home so we didnt get a chance to see them but o wellmaby next time. After thenice dinner made byhis maid we headed back to the hotel to sleep.   Sunday- Got up early to go to church a couple of stops awy from our hotel. O by the way we got from place to place every single day by taking the MTR, which was a public transportation underground. It was really cheap and really convenient since it went all over HongKong. So we went to church and after went back to change from our nice clothes. We walked around after that and went out to lunch at this Japanese restaurant where we had like noodles and fried chicken.Then met up with my moms cousin at the MTR terminal and went out to lunch AGAIN. So after the nice lunch we met up with my old pastor and his wife who use to pastor our church but then moved back to Hong Kong. It was really nice to see them again since we hadnt seen them in like 3 years. So after a great time of fellowship and dinner we walked around another huge mall that was 9 stories high so when you get up to the top its really scary. Next, we parted ways and got back on the MTR to go to our hotel.   Monday- Thiswas the big day, the day everyone that we metand talked to had warned us about. Going to Shenzghen or however its spelled.... Everyone had warned us aboutpeople stealing our moneyor drugging usand stealing our money by making us passout, or even killing us.SOooooooooo im like o man thats great just great. So the whole timei was really scared and i barely brought anything along with me. But this was the day that we hit the REAL CHINA! So we got on our way andhad a really hard time getting through customs. They were staring at us and like saying all this stuff in Chinese that were really weird.So we finally got in and headed on our way to our first destination. Itwas a theme park calledWindows of the World.It was full of minymonuments from all over the world.I wish i could've got something from there but there was really no giftshops at all.The reallykewl thing was that they had a inside ski slope where people can ski, snowboard, or just slide down the hill. So after we finished goingthrought the park we wentfor lunch at this restaurant that gave us kinda really bad food.It was okayto me but everyone else almost starved from not eating. After lunch we headed over to another theme park called Splendid China where they had minature things except they were all from China. We saw the Great Wall and other minature places that ive never heard of.O yeah before that we actually went to like 2 theme parks before that but i forgot thename of them but it really wouldnt matter b/c they were kinda boring. SO we ate dinner whichwas almost exactly like the stuff we had for lunch. If you're getting tiredof reading this i really wouldntblame you.Then we saw a lazor light show that had a lot of dancing and good stuff like that.It was really nice but it looked way to busy on the stage.O yeah! It included live horses and live goats which i thought was kinda interesting. So by then we were really beat so they took us back to the hotel and once we got there ibelieve we headed to the night marketswhich say openuntil12 midnight.   Tuesday-Lets see i dont really remember what we did today but all i know is that we met up with my Dad's old roomy again for dinner and went to the Thai restaurant in some mall. The food was REALLY GOOD. I loved it soooooooooo much! We had like soft shelled crab and crab balls and some type of beef and veges. I just wish that the restaurant was somewhere in California instead of all the way in Hong Kong. Lets see..... hmm in think we went to the Night Markets again.....  Wednesday- We got up again and had dim sum for breakfast at a little place right across from our hotel. That was really good but the service was kinda bad and plus they were like out of a lot ot things. So after the good stuff we headed over to the museum of Hong Kong and saw a lot of the history of the area. We saw the ancient stuff to the modern day stuff like when Japan occupied Hong Kong to when Great Britian gave back Hong Kong to China in 1997. We took like 3 hours inside and then went to lunch to a place i dont remember and to dinner at a place i dont remember either. We also went to the night markets earlier b/c we had to get up earlier the next morning.  Thursday- Got up at 2 for some reason and looked outside only to see tons of people standing outside in front of the nightclub right next to our hotel. I was thinking...dang this is like Vegas, no one ever goes to sleep. So i went back to bed and got up at 4:30 to catch our bus ride back to the airport where we would arive like 2 hours later. We waited at the airport and had yummy noodles for breakfast. Then we hopped on the plane for a 4 hour ride over to Japan. We stayed there for like an hour so in that time i made the best out of my trip to Japan by walking on Japanese soil, drinking Japanese water out of the drinking fountain, and useing their restrooms. In the end we hopped on another plane to San Fran which lasted like 9 hours. So when we arrived i noticed that we had left at 9:30 AM on thursday and arrived at 9:30 AM on thursday, which i thought was kinda funny. SO we got back home, ate some lunch, and basically slept the whole day after.   Im finally done with this entry..... i hope i filled up the whole page. Nowthat i thinkof it and look at all i wrote, i dont really think so.
