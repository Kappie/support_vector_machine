LoL! so, he said that he still wanted me to meet mr french (again), so we were gonna go over there first, just for a little while (tim had forgotten i was spending the night @ his house hehe--so i decided to play along). we got to mr.french's and met up with bobbie and evan! angel was there, and so was sophie, who i really like a lot! we get there, and they were all sitting down to dinner. i had already eaten, but tim was insisting that i wasnt telling the truth haha! so, after dinner, chris (mr.french) said that everyone had to go swimming. so he threw some trunks @ everyone, and told them to get ready. i didnt go in, and neither did like half the ppl, but anywayz, we had fun! we watched the PRACTICE with his mother in law, and just had good times. the rest of the night was spent talking, playing video games, getting messed up by daniel, and then woken up by my mother haha! tim and i went to 2nd hour @ church, and just chilled....didnt do much today--argued with the parents, then went back to church....call me PLEASE b/c i am so freaking bored ahh!!!
