But the fat pussy cat wasn't even there! L0L! He came like 5mins after me, walking like a King and shaking tt fat @$$ of his. L0L!  Well, today was my 'O' Lvl Food and Nutrition cooking practical exam. It didn't go according to plan. Haha, but it was still pretty alrite. I managed to juz pass, which is already good enough for me. We reached there at 11:00am and everything was over at 3:00pm. L0L! tt was realli long and tiring.  After the practical, the fat pussy cat forced me to follow him and the lil' pig to watch Troy again. He even threatened me! How mean of him! L0L! So we headed down to Jurong Point to catch it. The next time slot was 6:05pm and it was onli 4:05pm when we got there. So we had 2hrs before the movie began. We went to Long John Silver and slack there for about an hour and a half. There was nothing realli happening, I juz suddenly lost my mood and was kindda down, but thank god the fat pussy cat was there to bring laughter and joy. L0L!  When it was close to 6:05pm, we went in and waited in there. Yea, so nothing much happened in the cinema, juz watching Troy for the second time. It was kindda boring, but I guess it wasn't tt bad. L0L! The fat pussy cat was threatening to whack me for no particular reason! Wad a bully! Hmmph! L0L!  I reached home like 9:30pm and yea tt's bout' it for the day. So, peace ya? Haha, cya guys around! =]
