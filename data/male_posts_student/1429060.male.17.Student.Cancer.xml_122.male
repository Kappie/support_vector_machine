It seems that the main idea behind it is eating whatever you want - chicken, steaks, a bowl of animal fat - as long as you avoid the carbohydrates. Thus, you could stop by McDonald's for several weeks in a row and order one hamburger, no bun, and lose twenty pounds of weight.  However, though I am but a high school biology student, I think that there might be something wrong with this concept.  Namely, the whole avoidance of carbohydrates. (By the way, carbohydrates translates as sugars and starch. This comes into play later.) I do think that in every, mind you, every metabolism study in bio class, the very basis of cellular respiration (human digestion and energy usage) is a carbohydrate. Specifically, a little six-carbon sugar named glucose. This molecule is responsible for unleashing most of the energy your body needs. I do not think that a full blown bio lesson is necessary right now, but I do think that some priorities need to be straightened.  Where are we going to get not eating carbs, aka, one of the most important molecules in your body? Sure, you begin to look like a twig perhaps, but you also have a fucking off-balance metabolism. Let us state a biological fact: carbs are necessary for human survival. Period.  If one is so anxious about eating carbohydrates, let him/her choose unrefined sugars at least. Of course you aren't wonderfully healthy on a diet of pasta; it is way too refined. Fruit sugars (carbohydrates, mind you) are unrefined. That is why they are so healthy. If you want top avoid fruits too, with their vitamins and whatnot, be my guest. It has carbs.  Sorry about that. Eating vanllina ice cream with low-fat high-sugar hot fudge, thank you.
