We had a fun family dinner, ya know me, pizza...... and other part food stuffs. Then I unwrapped my gifts. I got a Star Wars book, a book on medieval swordsmanship, a book on how to use Nunchakus, Unreal Tournament 2004 (a video game),and a Star Wars board game. I'm also getting a sword but it's back ordered and I won't get it till June.... So that night we played with my game I looked at my books, spent like an hour installing UT2004... so that was a great day. Friday I had to get ready for my campout. I don't think much else happend then except for David coming over to spend the night so we could take him to the campout the next morning. So, Saturday I get up at 4a.m. make sure I'm already and we go to meet the rest of the grooup at the Yoder Dairy... and like usual everyone else is late. So we sit around for a few minutes and some other guys get there. Well once everybody was there we loaded up and got on the road. We drove for four hours up to Assoteauge Maryland, you know the island with all the wild horses? We got there and loaded up the canoes and we were off! We canoed... and canoed for like three hours. Some places it was so shallow that we had to get out and pull our canoes. Well once we finally get to the campsite we are immediately attacked by ticks the size of small trailer homes. Jonathan Gill got like 3 the firs second we were there. Well once we were all set up we just hung around for the rest of the time. I peeled tons of carrots and potatoes for dinner.... yeah, fun stuff. After dinner me and a bunch of other guys walked to the other sside of the island to the ocean.... wow. Where I live going to the beach is just like the bay. It was awesome. It was getting dark and the fog was coming in so you couldn't tell where the horizon was, and the breeze was blowing uber hard. It was just so fun. I wish all of my friends could have been with me then. Well the next day (Sunday), after waiting forever for breakfast and having a smal worship service we packed up and went off.   The water was even lower!   so we pulled our canoes most of the way back to the parking lot and to make a long story short........ we were eaten by wild horses. No just kidding. We loaded kup our canoes and went home. Well I got home and found out that I was no longer human. I'm now more like one big sunburn. So I've pretty much crashed for the last couple of days. Gael got me my present today. It's this T-shirt with an old Nintendo controller on it that says "Know your roots" he he. So thanks to Gael! Well I'm sitting here thinkin I'm gonna play some Unreal Tournament so I guess I'll see most of you at the bonfire and to all the rest, I'll see you when I see you. "Live long and Prosper."     \\// \UU
