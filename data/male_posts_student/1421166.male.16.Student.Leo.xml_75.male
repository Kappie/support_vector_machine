And I'm feeling really tired too. No idea why. Guess it's just the exams. Somehow, I really miss the 'happy-go-lucky' attitude.  I'm kinda like alone these days, haven't been catching up with anybody. So also don't tell people much about what's happening. And I'm getting too lazy to share my life with people already. Anyway, sometimes it just feels good to lead your own life. But guess that's kinda selfish though. But the good side of these now, is that I'm growing with God. So basically the only person I really share with is God. It really does give me the 'always here for me' feeling. I guess we can never be more secured than in Christ. We might not notice, but in our hearts, I believe that many of us depend on God. I remember reading in 'The Notebook' by Nicholas Sparks about how the girl, Allie, told the guy about how he was the only thing constant in her life. I guess that's what God is to me, someone who is always constant.  I'm starting to feel more for my school ministry already. We haven't been doing much recently, so I really hope that we would grow as a group. But it's hard especially when we're all from different denominations with different beliefs, so we kinda have different beliefs, or rather similar ones that are of different extreme-ness.  Oh ya...talking about other people just now, I'm glad I've been keeping in touch with Emilia since she left. It's like so cool! And we're sharing thru email la. So at least there's someone else I can talk to.  I've been trying to be perfect these days, and obviously I'm horrible at it. But guess that's true for any human. But I guess we should all just make the effort to be Christ-like. Not just better moraled people, but Christ-like(anybody can practice good morals).  I just realised that I usually don't have someone to talk to in church. Cos I was like just walking around this morning and felt so bored. Maybe it's just that I don't really have a fixed group of people to hang around. (haha...like Yongquan) But even with my own peers, there aren't much to talk about and if I ask about their lives, it just feels odd. I wonder how people start conversations so easily. I guess I don't talk well, even though I talk alot actually. But usaully end feeling interupting other people. Sian...maybe it's a chance for me to be in solitude. Besides that, I only talk to other people about work or something that is service related. Just hope it's not because I'm totally preoccupied with work.  There's this hymn we sung today. It came right after I was thinking about how little I loved God. Then just felt so bad and guilty. Then I started to get the 'am I a professing christian' feeling. But the hymn has this part that talks about how we realise our insignificant love for God, but yet we'll continue to love Him more and more. It's hymn 141 and here it goes:  It is a thing most wonderful, Almost too wonderful to be, That God's own Son should come from heaven And die to save a child like me.  And yet I know that it is true: He came to this poor world below, And wept and toiled and mourned and died, Only because He loved us so.  I cannot tell how He could love A child so weak and full of sin; His love must be most wonderful, If He could die my love to win.  But even could I see Him die, I could but see a little part Of that great love, which, like a fire, Is always burning in His heart.  It is most wonderful to know His love for me so free and sure; But 'tis more wonderful to see My love for Him so faint and poor.  And yet I want to love Thee, Lord: Oh, light the flame within my heart, And I will love Thee more and more Until I see Thee as Thou art!  William Walsham How, 1823-97
