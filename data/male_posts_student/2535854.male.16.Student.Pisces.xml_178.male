Well,he was accused of committing the murder between 1:30am - 4:30am at a condominium in Sri Hartamas on the 5th of December ,2003.He and Noritta knew eachother BUT he had an albi.An impeccable one.That night he was talking with his wife and sister in-law and her husband..just merely chatting and went to bed at midnight.All albi`s same!And hes been in Custody since December 8 2003.Damn.  The testimony of two security guards were not truthful.Their 1st statement had nothing abt Hanif.But all of a sudden after being thrown into lock-up they made a testimony claiming they last saw Noritta with him talking to people in a White Perodua Kancil.But where is the Kancil?What was the car registration number?They claimed to have forgotten.I think perhaps theyw ere threatened by the police.  But most importantly.The presence of DNA of two unknown males blurred the prosecution`s case.But who are they?They have his DNA but know clue who they are.And her roommate Nur Azora or Azura had seen a man reeking with body odour leaving and looked like an Indian and had long hair tied in a pony tail.Yeah...it does suit an Indian man`s description..  BUT one thing,She knew Hanif and had met him often and could tell the difference between him and the mystery man.Although in the dark,Hanif who must be 6'3 or 6'4 can be easily iddentified in the dark.Thats tall even in European standards!  The Defence claimed that they had shared an intimate relationship and that his DNA was found inside her and that they had sex.But he killed her on the motive of Jealousy as it is claimed he was jealous of Noritta`s close relationship with another man.But it is just a THEORY.In fact it is said he didn`t even know about their relationship and if so,why would he kill her without a motive?That went unanswered by the prosecution.  Well,after committing the crime,surely the mystery person(s) would have done whatever to make them un recognisable such as shaving off hair and blah.He in fact would have probably fled the country.Though they don`t have his name which would mean he can live normally,they have his DNA so should anything arise..that could be it for him..  They said not long after Noritta moved in,the other roommate some man names soemting..had moved out..they wondered did he ever give back the key?Because they found no signs of forced entry and that the killer was known to her.So why didn`t they go after him?If he is guilty..then he likely will not be found.  You have to say..perhaps as part of the media,perhaps they rushed the case.They hurried.They wanted to quickly charge someone to prove that they (the police) can do their job well and that Malaysia is a safe place to go to.While they proudly showed off that they had found the prime suspect,the real guilty person had time to escape and is likely reading the verdict of the trial in the newspapers and will think to himself that he is a good criminal.They never found him.  Do you think that there is a cover-up to protect a VIP or anything?could be possable.The prosecution just seemed to bring up things that would make Hanif look guilty without any reasons for what he did..claiming the injuries on Noritta is of by a big man and Hanif is a big man.But there very well could be a cover-up.The Judge denied there`s one.But possably.The IO at the time of the case,didn`t seem interested in persuing a second suspect.So you wonder..  Although the crime was shocking and caused a big outrage at first,its not like Noritta was a foreign tourist or the daughter of a big-shot of rich person.Yes,it is big news,but certainly not as big as it was made to be.They should also thing about the family of the victim and now also the now acquitted accused.How do they feel about all this?  Well I dont belive ive left anything more interesting or important out.  So my final conclussion is that : The killer will never be found.He`s covered his tracks well and will not re-surface again.
