Whether to live for him, or live against him, there is no middle ground. I have chosen to live for him, yet I fail all of the time.   I have many friends, as some of you may know, but very few of them have made the same choice that I have. Today, I had to think of someone who means a lot to me, remember details about them, then I had to picture them gone. I pictured about a dozen people and only two stuck out far in my mind for me to remember.   Dominique; my girlfriend of 1 year and a half now was the first one that I remember thinking about. I thought about her gone and I know that it would change my life, I would live though.  Chris; my brother. Chris is mentally handicapped. We belive that he has autism. If I were to lose him, unlike losing Dominique, I would not be able to live. I know for a fact that I would just lose all volition to live. My brother means my life to me. Nobody knows him as well as I do. I just don't think that life would make as much sense. Christopher was the person who made me who I am. He gave me immense patience that even though it breaks sometimes, is incredibly firm.   As I sit here and hold back my tears, I learn that it's not possible. I can't not cry and now I think that I am going to go. Bye everybody.  "I can live without Lauren, I can't live without Tompanga." --Boy Meets World
