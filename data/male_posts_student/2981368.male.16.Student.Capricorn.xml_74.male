Instead was woken at about usual time by dad on his way to work, being as annoying as is physically possible. IE assuming it was a school day, and turning lights, alarms etc on. GAH!  Sort of got up, forgot about breakfast till after I'd had lunch (doh) then went on a nice long dog walk. As in, run to the Leisure Centre the field way, then run back. Saw Nat  Holly as I came back into the big field, but stupid dog decided to just sit down and rest. So I couldn't go and see them. And now I have a pissed-off feeling that I'm not gonna see her again over the hols.  Title pretty much sums it all up. From Blackadder (of course =D) "I made a diary entry on the way here......it just says "bugger"." - Capt. Darling  Current mood: "Collective Soul - Not the One" / a cross between tired, annoyed and looking forward to tomorrowness.
