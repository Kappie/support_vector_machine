It's going to feel so good as I need some rejuvention to progress any further this week.  Work has just been unreal lately - I have been putting up with the same shit everyday, and it has been so busy. Saturdays are usually dead, and very slow; but I took more calls today than yesterday - and yesterday was very busy. It's just been an irritable week.  The C.L.E comes on Wednesday - I still have yet to get my tickets as we are all going on the last night :) It should be fun I need to get my mind off of work and what not at the time...  I am dreading returning to school, and I hate to be saying that since its another month before we go back, but I have been seeing flyers and commercials already for it and it makes me even more sad because I am loving the summer so much. So relaxed and stress free. Besides work anyway :)  I still have yet to pick up my Zyban prescription...I would like to begin to quit smoking very soon. I am a little nervous to try the pill though because I have heard of some strange side effects. I suppose I will just look on the bright side - that way I make not overreact on account of anything.  Anyways, need to make this short. I am absolutely exhausted and I need my well-deserved rest.   .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Night everybody...
