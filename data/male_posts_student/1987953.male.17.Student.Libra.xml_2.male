Since my last message on my former blog page, I have been going out with this really cool girl named Brittany, also a Christian. I see her tomorrow actually. Anyway, leave a message. The next blog I should have something cool to respond to and try to cause conversations! I should post at least once daily. See you all later! E-mail me: OriolesFan2001@hotmail.com
