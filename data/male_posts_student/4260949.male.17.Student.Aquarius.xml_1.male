I am not the only one; in fact i havn't seen so many people procrastinate on their summer homework ever. Must be senioritis all ready kicking in. So if you know me and know how i am about school about school work, you'd probably be avoiding me right now. Surprisingly i am completely chill about things now. I'm not saying that things aren't crazy right now, becuase they are, but everything else is going crazy while i sit her completely at ease.  As summer begins to wind down, I am trying to get last breaths of summer freedom. The days of being able to go out till midnight during the week are dwindling in number. Luckily i got Lyndsey to give me a ride to iMusicast after my little car issue. I am so glad she did because when i got there i got to spend a couple solid, yet noisy, hours with Cullen. I am happy whenevere and whereever i get to talk to him. When the night ended and i was walking to his car to get my mix tape/cd, i kept wishing for more time with him. My low self-esteem kicks in as usal and i feel like im smothering him, but i hope im not and hope thatd hed be comfortable enough to tell me if i was. I need to sop worrying but stuff like that, things are going to happen as they are supposed to.  On a completely unrelated note my bulletin board came!!!!!! For some reason i put pictures of hot australian and british popstars on it instead of hot guys. Cullen need not worry though, i pass on pussy.
