I've got one foot in the US and the other here on Canadian soil.  Our furniture and personal belongings (and my heart) are in Jersey, my daughter, my clothing (and my body) are in Toronto, and my husband is in Atlanta.  Aaargh!    I'm in blog withdrawal and can't update my personal website since my files and my computer are in a box.  Jay is this close to finally making the leap and purchasing that laptop so we can be totally mobile.  Jay and I are pretty useless without our computer and high-speed internet.     In other news, Jay's first week with the new company went well, but busy as all hell (whoa what a poet I am!) He arrived into Toronto early Saturday morning and flew back to Atlanta first thing this morning.  I think business travel lost all its glamour in about 5 minutes flat.    Jessica started swimming lessons today.  She's in AquaQuest 2 at 9am.  Good way to get me going in the morning - that and an extra large double double Tim's!  Yum!
