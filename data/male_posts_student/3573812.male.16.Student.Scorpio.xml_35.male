The people around me seem to cope with living, so why can't I? Why must I question the decisions I make, or the the thoughts that I have? Why must I question my existence and the purpose of it? I don't want all the things the people around me want. But I do. Maybe I just don't want to want them. Idon't want to take a meaninglessjob then live a life of spiritualunawareness and find myself foreverquestioning theexistence of happiness. Iwant to tell the world my secrets so that I may befree of their burden. I want enlightenment. I want inner peace. I want to experience pure happiness, joy, elation, nirvana. I want to understand myself, my entire being. And I want to help others do the same. I want to live a simple life, filled with compassion, understanding, tolerance, truth and light.    I want to do all these things, but until I am enlightened I shall live in this society, consuming, pretending to understand the concept of happiness and fooling myself into believing that I am experiencing it. And as I continue to keep everything inside, my secrets slowly driving me insane, and so called 'humanity' choking my spirit, causing it to wither and die.
