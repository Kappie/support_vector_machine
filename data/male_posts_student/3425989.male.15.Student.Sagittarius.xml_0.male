Music: Kill Bill THeme Song  grrrr damn you best buy coupons! before I start, sorry for not posting in a few days. anyway, Best Buy has a special on Xbox's so I was hyped and was heading out to get one but LO AND BEHOLD it doesn't start until tommororow. SOOOOOOOO I am going to get up at 6 and head over there. Otherwise, school is out (yay!) and I did the usual last day things, went around telling people they were jerks and I never has a shred of caring for them. Left one of my teachers a nice little note under her door (haha, a "nice" note.  ) otherwise today was normal. That's it I guess.  inf1d31, The non-believer (btw, there has been some confusion about my name, it is suppose be the 1337 version infidel for you non 1337ers)
