Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Don't Tell Me -Avril Lavigne Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #22 Staying true to her nationality, Avril Lavigne sounds pissed on this single. Fellow Canadian  Alanis Morissette , 11 years Lavigne’s senior, raged into America with “U Oughta Know” back in the ‘90s, and Avril revamped that act with a punk-pop edge for thousands of  Generation-Y  teens. Actually, angry people have given the world some great music (check out  N.W.A.’s  “Fuck the Police” or  Nirvana’s  “You Know You’re Right”), but Lavigne’s “Don’t Tell Me” sounds like she rewrote  Liz Phair’s  “Why Can’t I?” on a steroid rush.   The Verdict:  3.8/10 - Brouhaha   (1.9/5)
