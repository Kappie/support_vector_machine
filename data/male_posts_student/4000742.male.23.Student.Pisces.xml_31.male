There were about 10 legal situations to decide on, some true/false questions and a couple of short notes. I did fairly well although I couldn't remember the exact Section numbers and relevant cases. Most other people were satisfied with their performance, although there were some mistakes made in the finer points of company law cases.        Today was QAM. The paper had 5 questions, each of them consisting of some trivial or mechanical sub-parts, but with atleast one sub-part where you had to apply your mind and use some fundamental understanding of topics. I was quite confused in two of the questions, but thankfully, got over the confusion and did the problems. So I have done moderately well. But then, the performance of people in general was moderate to bad. Considering that 70% of the batch consists of engineers, this is not a good statement about our abilities. Somehow, this subject always has quite a lot of people getting failure grades (D or F).       Anyway, tomorrow is Org. Behaviour, a most descriptive paper. There is a lot to read.       The weather outside is extremely humid and the sky is very overcast. Strong winds have now started blowing and a good shower is expected.
