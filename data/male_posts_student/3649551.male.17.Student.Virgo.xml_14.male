Okay, so I'm not a monk yet. Maybe someday. Seriously though, it may not be as interesting for any readers out there, but not having anything going on romantically is bliss. Because by 'romantically' I mean the only thing I have experience with: one-sided crushes followed by a flurry of flak, no parachute, losing radio contact, deep in enemy territory with no hope of rescue ... getting shot down. I'm a teenager, though. I'm sure it will pass and my raging hormones will flare up again at some point. Like, tomorrow. And when that happens, everybody else will be excited because I'll be another pitiful kid with another hopeless crush. Don't feel guilty about it. I love to experience that from an outside perspective. Makes me feel better about life in general. But for now, I'll just enjoy the peace of mind that goes with being in control of my emotions. Under lock and key. Die, feelings.
