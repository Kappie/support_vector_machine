Well it was a really shitty type of week which gradually got worse as the week went on and on. Never the less - this is not last week and I really think things are on the up. I have a spontaneous confidence streak to do with my esteem (I'll write the second part to  the esteem thing  soon I promise) and I reckon, despite some odd setbacks that it's going rather well and better than expected. Maybe (in my warped imagination) it will lead to some kinkual shenanigans if that makes any sense with this one person I must have loved and liked, on and of for God knows how many years. Well I hope so anyway, as does the ensuing draw which will be evidently present. OOh I'm definetely going to write some erotica about that one mwahahahahahahaha. Ciao xBuBzx
