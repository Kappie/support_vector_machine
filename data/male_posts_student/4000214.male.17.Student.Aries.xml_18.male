You know…Going to church just because you have to…Craning your neck around the room looking for cute girls…Sleeping while pretending to pray solemnly…those kinds of things. I never really took going to church seriously. For me, it was just a waste of a good Sunday morning you can use for something important like sleeping, gimmicks, computer games et cetera. My parents also went church-hopping from time to time, looking for better pastors who won’t talk nonsense. We went on like this until the summer of 2004. My family was part of this new church called Victory at Fort Bonifacio which we joined a couple of months prior. This was where I met Joaquin. I’ve seen him lots of times around the church. He was one of the lead singers of the pop group 17:28 and, as his profession suggests, one of the more prominent singers in our church’s music ministry. On top of all that, he was very popular among guys and girls alike. He told me he was going to be my “cell leader”…whatever that means. A couple of days after, he sent me a text message saying that we were going to have a “cell meeting” on Saturday. I hesitated at first, but finally thought, “Sure…It’s worth a shot…maybe I’ll even get to meet a couple of cute girls.” That Saturday, I went to Starbucks to meet with Joaquin. Little did I know, though, that this thing they called a “cell meeting” would change my life forever.
