We got out 10 minutes early, and you won't hear me complaining.  When I finally break through my incalculable wall of procrastination and actually start working, I'll get to "cutting" cards. Apparently we don't actually cut them until the last couple days. Huh.  I was caught in the act of blogging by Emily yesterday. Yeah, now she and her friends will know my every thought and emotion I enscribe on this electronic tablet. Meh. It's not like I have anything to hide *darts eyes from side to side*.
