Then I remember you, I remember about the times that we were at schoolYou used to seat next to me… I’ve been remembering those times a lot lately,Now we are long away one from another, I feel melancholic,I miss those times…The only way to reach you and those memories is just by feeling melancholic… We are grown up now Things are different, everything is much more serious now…I don’t know if can stand it.Today it’s a dark evil deep night, I’m felling weightless, that light is coming again… I’m going away. I’m dieing in my own existence, or …maybe not…
