Listening to XY's Tao Ze now, very nice man, nice voice, good lyrics (except for the english......lol). Imo, he's by far one of the most musical of all pop artists, and you can tell he's got quite a free creative hand at things. Ultrasound is evidence of that. I alos respect him alot because of his songwriting, "Melody", writing about his break up with his girlfriend of 7 years (i think its 7), plus many others which you can tell are really from genuine heartfelt, exposure to love.  This week in school has overall been great, even though MT O'levels are very nearby. I've also been doing quite abit of research on astrology. (Like I said, I believe alot in astrology, western astrology esp.). Reading up on it and stuff. The elections are over (yah i noe long time already, cos' blog never update lol). Very happy with the results. BN won by a great margin. And PAS, I can't stand them man, like any religious bigot, always quoting God after a lost. Besides Astrology, i've also been reading up on Eschatology, but not really the finer points of it, but rather, the philosophical persepctives on the whole subject as a whole. I shall try to crystallize my thoughts on this subject, and this would be in line with the Secularization essay.   Wah on saturday ah, I was damn itchy man............scratching all over the place, all the prawns. I went out with Chin Han and Woon Han orchard road somemore, whole body itchy man, very gao wei. Somemore in the MRT some more, no place to sit. Really sucks. Go home, bathe then sleep the ok already. Hmmm, actually there is some gan chu for this week, where Love is concerned, but I'm not gonna write here definitely. Writing it in a private blog though.......^^.   Yeah I've gtg already, damn sleepy now.........
