We went out and hung at a similar venue. We had a chat. It was fun. I want to be a doctor when I grow up, so that I can help all the sick people in the world. Childish babble through innocent lips. The world was much simpler then.  I'm more mature. I know lots more about love now. I knew most of it before, but it's clearer now. I still love her with all that I am. Even though it burns me. masochist. The good sort. Is there a good sort?  Desiree and Zel were in the closest proximity that they've ever been in. It was so damn Korean soap opera. Fate has a sick way of playing about with us.  Good night.
