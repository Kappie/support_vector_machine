I was wondering as I read it if the idea of the gentleman soldier is really all that dead.  At least in Vietnam (yes, I know there was a draft), most of the grunts came from lower-class families and, if I recall correctly, officers were career military men, West Pointers, etc.  Although the book doesn't really get at it (at least not yet), it seems to me that in order to have the opportunity to attend the USMA, you really need to have a pretty good home life and standard of living.  The application process is ridiculously complex.  Not a complaint, just a thought and comment.  I could, of course, be very wrong.  In other news, this had me chuckling: "'So my middle name is O'Keeffe,' Southerland explains, 'After the painter, Georgia O'Keeffe.  I use here paintings as computer wallpaper, always have.   From the Plains, The Larence Tree, From the Faraway Nearby. '  It's probably the last thing Georgia O'Keeffe even expected, to have a measured career assessment delivered from a set of BDUs.  'Her early collection, all the cityscapes and everything -- the more industrial, mechanical sort of canvases -- they get a little lost in the shuffle.  But they're beautiful.'"   Huah.
