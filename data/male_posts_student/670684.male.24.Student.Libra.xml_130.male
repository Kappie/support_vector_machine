Looking back it is no longer one of my favorites, but at one time it spurred me to action, and the palindromic characters of  Ana y Otto  were an interesting convention.    A favor to ask of you...would someone please  urlLink go here  and give this movie a terrible vote?  You might say to yourself, "That is dishonest, Rolin.  We haven't seen it."  Well, this is the one movie in the past seven years that I have walked out of, and I wasn't about to get action after it was over (a la my walking out of Jurassic Park II).  Looking through the booklet at the Austin Film Festival, we decided on  Beeper  to see Harvey Keitel.  Fifteen minutes into the movie he wasn't there, but the Indian subcontinent had been shamed beyond belief by B-list Hollywood producers, and the bratty child (who eerily resembles  urlLink Mick Foley ) in the film that is kidnapped is such a whiny bitch that we wish it was him rather than the teddy bear that gets two bullets to the head.  Or I wish it was me after watching that.  I just want this film to be in the bottom 250 at IMDB, and it needs more votes!
