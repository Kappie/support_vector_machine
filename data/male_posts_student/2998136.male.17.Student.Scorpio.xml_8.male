It's those crazy gals in my class and you are right, I am not going to the chalet. It costs around $25 and I am very poor to even fork out a dollar. Another reason is that we have a Flash project on hand to be done during the holidays. So I would rather make full use of this 3 days 2 nights staying at home even if I were to play WarCraft 3, I think it's far more better than having to suffer havoc and disaster there.  I know I am just being anti-social as well as sarcastic, I didn't mean to. It's good that those crazy gals organised a chalet because this is where they will be able to release their madness, craziness and also horniness. Take that chalet as an escape resort or a mental hospital to be exact, nobody will care, they can do whatever they like, running and jumping about, screaming and shouting, touching each other and molesting one another at a time, or even group raping on a broad-daylight. Well, I must not let them read my blog or I will be dead meat when school reopens.  Since I am not going for the chalet, that does not mean I miss the opportunity to stuff myself with those foods. Anyway their BBQ skill sucks and scientists had proven female BBQ skill is lousier than male. Tell you what, my mum is going to bring me to a wedding dinner tonight and those are what I called delicacies which is much more superior than those sausages, fish balls, artificial crab-sticks and chicken wings. Mine is gonna be shark fins, abalone, steam fish, roasted chicken/pig/duck, etc… At least I won’t have to smell and eat charcoal.  Poor those innocents who are going for the class chalet. I bet it must have been a bad hair day for them.
