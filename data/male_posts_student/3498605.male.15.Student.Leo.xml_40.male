Another good thing is you have a lot of extra time to just hang out with your friends between tests. Now the bad! They are worth 20% of your semester grade. You basically take tests all day. Plus, the tests are REALLY long and REALLY hard. Oh, and if you laughed at that, you are one sick perverted mofo. :). Anyways, I'm really excited because I only have four days of school left. Although, I am kinda sad because when school is out I won't see some of my friends that I really like to see. Although, I will hang out with at least most of my friends of the summer, hopefully :).  later, bradleyJ
