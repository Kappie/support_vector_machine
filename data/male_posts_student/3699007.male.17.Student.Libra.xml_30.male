He wants to teach me how to write an estimate so "I will have something to do to work my way through college".  If you don't know what my dad does, he is the body shop manager at a car dealership.  For what he does, he makes an obscene amount of money, and believe me, I'm definitely not rich, but the average for his job is like 30,000 and he makes 6 figures, so he is one of the best in the country at what he does.  Anyway, he will probably work his ass off today while I sit around and don't do anything and I'll never learn a damn thing.  I do wish I knew how to write estimates though, because one of his estimators just quit and he said he would have replaced him with me, even though I have no idea how I could have a full-time 8-6 job when school started back, but it would have been good money for hmmmmm...a month.  Britt comes home today, finally...so tomorrow should be fun.  I haven't seen him and Ashley in...3 weeks.  Damn.  Anyway, last night I didn't go to the fireworks thing, just as I said I wouldn't.  Watched all 3 of them on TV.  Gwinnett county spends $60,000 on fireworks.  That fireworks show lasted about 25 minutes, so that is roughly $2400 per minute.  I could think of better things for the county to do with $60,000, but fireworks are cool, and I can think of far worse things to do with $60,000...like giving Wayne Hill a raise.  Tonight should be busy.  I HAVE TO do homework from 2 sections of online and then do tomorrow's work if I feel like doing anything tomorrow.  Bastards even give you an assignment over the 4th of July "holiday" that thankfully I found out about because I didn't think I had one.  Even more thankfully, the "holiday" extends through today, so I can still do the homework.  Sorry for bitching, I failed the class the first time, and I agree, I should be punished for doing so.  Ok I can't think of anything else to write about.  Off to work I go, and I'm not getting paid.
