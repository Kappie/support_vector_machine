I am sorry Im so bussy. I don't mean to never be available. Its just sometimes all the drama catches up with me. Everyone knows itAcTiNgChIcK25: my dear we have some very dramatic friends. I just need/ed some time with my Edina friends. I am not saying they are superior to any of you I am saying it is just a nice break. It' annoying when people get mad for being bussy but than hang out with like two people in the group. It annoys me how certain people are all best friends. You guys are all my best friends but I don't have a best friend. Steph has WG's, Tara has Thomas, Thomas has Matt, Matt has Derek...etc. I don't have a TRUE best friend at stages, but I do have a few at Edina. I am sorry! ~Andy Feeling Of The Moment: Frusterated
