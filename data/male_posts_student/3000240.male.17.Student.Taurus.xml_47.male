I used to think that If I didn't exist that: "who the fuck is gunna care about me?". I think I must have only been around 6 or 7 at the time and I've only just in the last week or so managed to figure out that it was this and other factors that has caused my problems through all stages of school and life I have been through. This could have been down to a couple of things I guess:  1. No siblings of my own age, 2. How hard it was for me to make friends in general when I was little, 3. The spoiling, lack of true discipline by Mum and Dad, 4. Or I could just be making a rash over judgment on the whole thing, and it could all be in my head.  I tend (or am trying to do more so) to disagree strongly with the latter as It has no relevance or evidence, and personally I think that the answer could be a mixture of all the other 3 alternatives on offer as they are all reliable, viable et al to everything about me. Both my sibling are over 30 and left home when I was 6 and the time they were living at home, weren't here much at all anyway. Being as my parents are quite  old  for parents aswell, I was quite lonely at an early age, and never really encouraged to go out and make friends much either. Because of this perhaps, or possibly because of some obscure biological reason, making friends was never really an easy thing for me. Sure I had some. I wasn't Billy no friends definitely, but I had a nack for over-reacting and being a selfish brat.    Part Two Tomorrow   xBuBzx
