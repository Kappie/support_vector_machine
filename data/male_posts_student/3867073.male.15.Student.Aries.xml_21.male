I have a golf lesson (more about that later) at three, so that wouldn't work out I thought. So I came back home and made good use of my time. I rode up to Watts park on my bike on the Green Bay trail to play some disc golf. The ride was slow and hard because the wind was against me, but i finally got there and found watts park. I don't own any disc golf discs, so I played with a frisbee, which turned out to be much harder. I couldn't break bogey golf in both my nine hole rounds, but oh well its just my first time. I had issues with throwing the frisbee far enough, and the wind didn't help. Any way, I then rode into glencoe just to see what was up (not much) and came home, seriously considering having snack at panera in wilmette, but deciding against that. My choice paid off because I had cold leftover pizza (a personal fave)! I was loafing around the house when I realized that I hadn't played tennis in the longest time, so I went over to maple park with my dad and my sister and hit tennis balls around for 45 minutes. So now I am about to have lunch. This afternoon I will start taking golf lessons at tee to green at willowhill with a hourlong pre-assessment thingy. I think I also might start my summer reading (god forbid) this afternoon.
