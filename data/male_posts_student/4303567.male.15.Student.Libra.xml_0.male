Is it the way your words never come out how they should because you are afraid of saying something hurtfull? Or is it just the way that person changes your world completely when you are with them? I just don't know, and I don't think anyone will ever know. Whatever it is I think I have found it, because I met this special person about 5 months ago and since she has entered my life it has been completely different. I have changed completely and all just because of her. My reasons for doing this are simple. I love her with all of my heart and I will do anything to keep her by my side. Yes, I am afraid of losing her, because I don't know what my life would be without her. She is my sun during the day and my moon at night. Basically without her I am dead, because every minute, every second without her I feel that I am lost in another planet. So finally what is love?? I don't know this very moment, but I do know that there is something inside of me telling me to keep hold of her as long as I can. CLAUDIA I LOVE YOU WITH ALL OF MY HEART.
