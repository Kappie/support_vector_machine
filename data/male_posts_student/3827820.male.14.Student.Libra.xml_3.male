Hope so!   Things ain't turning up right when I reached my hostel - the pumps are continueing to leak, when we're desperately looking for a plumber. My laptop got infected with virus when I was about to update my latest virus definition. My roomates' shadows aren't seen anywhere, leaving me in a silent four-bedder room...   Teddy-O-Ted, good luck!   *Tips of the day - Try serving juicy friuts (e.g. watermelons  honeydew) with concentrated lemon juice... they just taste great!!
