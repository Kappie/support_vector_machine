It has come to my attention that many people that go to church and some that go to my church believe that in order to be a "good" Christian- you have to be a Republican.  Many of these Jerry Folwell types go as far as to label any non- Republican a sinner.   first of all- I all ways thought that Politics was something that has, more than anything else, split up brothers and sisters in Christ. I distinctly remember one time having a conversation with my pastor, at the time.  He started talking about politics.  We had never talked about politics before so he never knew my "southpaw" tendencies when it came to politics.  He said "Oh, you are into politics? What party are you?  Wait wait, I don't even know why I ask caus' if you're a Christian, you must be a Republican."  Now, I always knew that there was always a right leaning tendency when it came to the church- especially Baptists, but I didn't it was to the ridiculous point to where one's faith would be questioned if they weren't a Republican.  I believe this is why our founding fathers had a separation between church and state.  They didn't want to the two inner-mingling because, has history has shown as a fine record, things an an often get really ugly.  This is why I don't talk about politics in church, because church is a place for fellowships with fellow believers- where you worship, love and pray with one another.  It is not time, nor should it be, a platform for Republican or Democrats.  Christ never talked about platform politics.  He talked about loving each other and being a devout follower of God.    Also, unlike many of my American counterparts, I do not think that the GOP equals GOD.  There are a lot of things that I find wrong in both parties, so I'm not saying that Democrats are angels.  So it is not tha I think that the Democrats are truly the ritcheous party, because I don't agree with everything that the Democrats do.  But if you were to put all the issues out on the table (i.e. abortion, taxes, social programs, gay rights, war policy, trade policy, education etc.)- I definitely with out a doubt have more issues over all that I agree with the Democrats on.  In reality I am more of a "center left" person.  Sometimes I totally agree with Republicans.  But for the most part I am shamelessly with out a doubt a Democrat.
