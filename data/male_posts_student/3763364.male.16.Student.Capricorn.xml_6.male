Then again, I don't think they would have appealed to a male demographic larger than 10% if they called it an "Online Diary Thingy."    Let's see, I got some Chinese food, and theres a fortune cookie. Before I go on to tell you my illustrious fortune, let me tell you about Chinese food. Chinese food that we eat here is nothing like it actually is in China,including theinsanely high MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) content that clogs your blood vessels. Do you honestly thing that Chinese people eat ginger beef, chicken balls and fried rice every damned day? The answer is no. Pretty much the only thing you'll find on the menu in an ACTUAL Chinese restaurant that resembles ANY of the crap they serve here is the rice. They eat things there that you can't even imagine. And it's damn good, too.  The whole Chinese food deal they've got going on here in North America is awful. It gives everyone on this bloody continent a skewed concept of asian lifestyle, pushing bias on us in a suttle, but still existant manner.  Here's an example, and here's what my fortune cookie says:  "Confucius say: Show-off always shown up in showdown."  First off, most Chinese people don't even know what a fortune cookie is. This is mostly because it was yet another dumb idea developed by the western culture.  Second, that has to be the single most racist thing I have ever seen towards the Chinese culture. What? Does every Chinese person talk in some ridiculous accent missing bits and pieces of sentences? NO.  Third, that isn't even a fortune! A fortune is: "You will be struck by a bus at 11:35 pm next teusday."  But hey, there are lotto numbers, or at least, what I presume to be lotto numbers on the back. If only I were old enough to buy lottery tickets....   Six days until I get braces. Six days until I'll be not only unable to smile, but afraid to do so when I actually am happy, in fear of showing of my ridiculous metal aperture to everybody. And it's all for beauty! What I hypocrit I am! Well no, that's not entirely true, the orthodontist says that further complications could arise down the road...And I didn't even think my teeth were that bad...*sniffle*  Six days. When the new school year comes, I probably won't even smile on photo day. I will have my braces soon before then. I will be "The Boy Who Never Smiled."   On a much lighter note, I have coined a new "suprised" phrase. Some people say "Holy crap!" or "WTF!?" Me, I used to say "Jesus Tapdancing-Christ!" Well now, I have a new phrase:  "SWEET ZOMBIE-JESUS!!!"  Just to be clear, I don't hate God, I hate religion. Remember, go God, booo religion.  *gets struck by lightning out of nowhere*
