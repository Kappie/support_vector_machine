The "sites" post however is still postponed.    This games difficultly setting is said to be higher than a hippie in an airplane....I agree.     urlLink http://www2.abc.net.au/fly/flysui/flysui.html      Ahh the curve ball this game never gets old.  urlLink http://rebarb.homeip.net:8081/flashgames/curveball.html   Perfect parking...Nice one bruda.  urlLink http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pparkgame.html   Paper throw 1. It has cool little nintendoesque tunes aswell as being completely useless  urlLink http://www.sticky.tv/game/cyrkam_airtos/   Paper throw 2.This is in the bbc learning section?! And its promoting the show "the office" which is pretty good.  urlLink http://game.panlogic.net/   Prince of Persia. One of my childhood favourites. Not exactly the same but it'll do.  urlLink http://www.gamespot.com/promos/princeofpersia-game/flash/index.html    A simple but fiendishly addictive game. Build your Tower with high numbers at the bottom and small numbers at the top. Dont let the Vikings win  urlLink http://www.gamerival.com/index.cfm?Play=C8496A22&fromint=1   Table tennis. Great game , you can do spins quite effectively and smashes.  urlLink http://www.miniclip.com/tabletennis.htm   Zookeeper is like a lot of other puzzle games, But its cute so im putting it in.  urlLink http://www.bobpitch.com/zookeeper/zk.html   I thinks this is a port from Sonic Advance 2 well the graphics are the same so to the manerisms of the characters but the levels are different. Its not as fluid either. Kinda cool i guess.  urlLink http://www.flashplayer.com/games/ultimateflashsonic.html
