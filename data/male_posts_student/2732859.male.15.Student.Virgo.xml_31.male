This is going to fail miserably and the crazy Christian Right will have to go pick on another group of people.  Aren't they supposed to be for states' rights?  I guess states don't have rights if it goes against the GOP.  They also complain about activist judges going against the will of the people.  What about Bush v. Gore in 2000 with activist judges ruling against states' rights and going against the will of the people.    Ok, well, i'll be back after the Senate vote to respond to it.
