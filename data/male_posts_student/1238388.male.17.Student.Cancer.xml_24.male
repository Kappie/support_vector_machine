The little I did watch included a moment that I understood and it moved me deeply. It brought home a point that I've been thinking for quite a long time now. It's about how much more we have in common, than we differ from each other. Whatever our political leanings, philosophical views, country of origin or gender, we as humans have very much in common. Each of us as humans feels, thinks, loves, hurts, fears, desires, and dreams. We love our children, our mates, our pets. We set goals for ourselves, we work, we plan our futures, we reminisce about our pasts. We have flaws and we have fine qualities. We laugh, we cry. We identify ourselves as individuals and as part of the whole big complicated/simple, beautiful / ugly, neat / messy picture of human culture.    Hmm, thats alot of philosophical thinking... moving on.    I was having a conversation today with someone, who was relaying a story to me about going through the drive-thru of a fast food joint today and being handed back the wrong amount of change. The cashier made an error in his favor, and he ended up driving away with free food and extra money.    I just can’t do that. I always give the money back even if it means that I have to drive back to the restaurant or store. It would eat at me. My conscience, it would. I am of the opinion that it is not my money to keep. Some people are of the opinion that the extra cash is recompense for the many instances of screwed up orders and missing ketchup packets. Point taken. I’m the kind of weenie that will drive all the way back to an establishment to return their money, but will not turn the car around to complain when they get my order wrong. Others argue that lost change here and there is just the price that these places pay for hiring incompetent employees who are unable to make proper change for a twenty, even with the correct amount flashing on a screen in front of them. Point taken.    So my question to you guys and gals is this: What do YOU do? At one time or another, each of us has been faced with this situation. Do you pocket the cash or give it back? Or does it depend, for you, on whether or not the cashier was friendly?    Humor me, people...    My brother called me a little bit ago. Well, he isn’t my real brother, but my BEST friend…    He and I are pretty tight and I was ranting about a couple of things. Mostly I was expressing my case of the wiggins over finding yet another eMail from my ex-girlfriend. But I am resolved to not let it get to me.    I’ll pause here for a moment to allow you sufficient time to pat me on the back…ok, there…get off me.    But Meanie Krandle is not the point of this post. Oh no, ladies and gentleman, I have a much more disturbing agenda -- the point of this post is to make public the fact that I sat here and poured my heart out to my brother for a good twenty minutes before realizing that he had been ON THE CRAPPER the ENTIRE TIME. And some of you who are dating him need to know this!    Oh yes, dear brother, I am calling you out! I’m calling you out as a toilet-talker! A potty-prattler! A john-jabberer! A can-caller! After all, it was YOU, who called ME! Were you bored? Had you not a SINGLE THING to read in the apartment? Good God, man! Have you no shame?    There I was, chatting away ON MY LUNCH HOUR, when he actually said the words:    “Hey, can you hang on for like 30 seconds?”    “Sure, go ahead.” *nibble nibble on my sandwich*    [toilet flushing in the background] “Dude, my legs were falling asleep...”    Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! That is so freaking gross!    *gag*    But in regards to my breakup to Meanie Krandle and the case of the eMail…   Particularly my most recent ex – we broke up quite recently...    Yesterday morning I checked out my eMail to find a email attachment tucked under the chaotic mass of my eMail's masses. Actually, it was two eMails sealed in a encrypted ZIP because my ex knew I'd be able to crack it.    And a happy Sunday to you too...    After couple of hours of decryption scripts and programs… I finally got it to open up. The first eMail read, "Thank you for the card. I don't like you," and contained three smaller images inside, the covers of which were art prints that she knew I would like. The second card read, "Thank you for the year. I think about you constantly. I dislike you more,"    This isn’t the first time she does this, you know. Oh yes! She has left little notes for me in Yahoo! Instant Messenger or in my eMail mailbox since our break-up... one and half weeks ago. She leaves me alone for several days at a time only to resurface in the form of annoying little disdaining notes - digital reminders of her existence. The last time she did this was yesterday…I think. I have never responded. I always just throw them away. Deeeeeleted!    This one however, has me baffled. I don’t know what to make of it.    I didn’t do anything to her. As a matter of fact, I never, in the history of our ALMOST one-year relationship, do anything to her. Nor have I contacted her in any shape or form since the day of our break-up…over a week ago.    Perhaps this is a ploy to get a rise out of me. To get me to respond. To call her - not gonna happen. Or perhaps someone (maybe her psycho friend) persuaded her to do this and she actually thinks that it is gonna make me mad and beat her up. A bit far-fetched, perhaps, but I just don’t know what to think.    IT’S BEEN OVER A FREAKING WEEK, FOR CRAP’S SAKE!    I have been joking about this the last couple of days, mostly to mask my annoyance and the fact that I am more than a just little creeped out. I feel like my personal "bubble," if you will, has been violated. There is no address on these eMails – there never is. This girl, whose welcome expired…over a week ago, physically typed up these eMails and deposited these items in that encrypted ZIP file, and then sent them to my eMail.    In retrospect, I realize that I should not have even opened the file|email. That I should have – and will from now on – shred them, unopened. I am allowing this person whom I cast out of my life, for valid reasons, rule my emotions. No more of that, I say.    It would be easy for me to say that I am annoyed and upset because she caused me to be annoyed and upset, when in fact, I am annoyed and upset because I have allowed her to make me feel this way. What ticks me off the most is that I recognize this error in myself and yet I continue to let it bother me.    Enough about my ex...    I have reached that proverbial fork in the road. The fork though, interestingly enough, rests on my head and my hair is wrapped around it like so much spaghetti.    I have been floundering for weeks now about what to do with the mop on my head. The length of my hair has reached the awkward state in which it is too long to be short, and yet too short to be long.    My hair, normally short to just "good” enough to spike up, sprouted like a Chia Pet watered by my indecision, and is now dangling precariously just above my ears. It grows incredibly fast, you see. A fact that I like to attribute to the beehive of activity going on in my head, which causes my hair to be shoved through my scalp as my brain swells with brilliance; and not to some sort of conspiracy contrived by the manufacturers of whatever gel my mom buys (usually ICE) plops on my head and swears is just a gel.    Should I cut it? I like it short. I enjoy being able to just tuck it behind my ears and be done with it. And it is almost summertime (though, judging by our 75-85 degree weather here, you would have thought that summer started about a month ago). And I like being able to just slap my cap on my head and not worry about my hair sticking out all over the place.    That, my friends, is the long and the short of it, and I still have no idea what I will do.    Ch-ch-ch-Chia! Take care guys!
