But, that's not all I did this morning...I completely edited the HTML to include a brand new message board, guestbook, and a poll, and more new features on the way.  Here's what's new:  -bagel's blogs: This is the link list to both blogs in the bagel's blogs network.  There's only two links right now, but, who knows, maybe there will be another one soon.  -bagel's blogs interactive: These new features include a weekly poll, the guestbook, and the message board.  All three of these features are available on both The Blog of the Bagel and Bagel.Tech, so even if you go to just one of the blogs, you can still see the same message board and polls.  -bagel.tech: This is the new blog.  Like promised, it will feature the internet stuff, so that you can maximize your computer experience.  Definitely worth checking out.  It's updated a few times a day with new stuff, so, be sure to check it out.  That's about it for this incredibly short edition of The Blog of the Bagel.  Tonight, I'll post something new, and it'll actually have meaning to it.  Until then, go look at bagel.tech.
