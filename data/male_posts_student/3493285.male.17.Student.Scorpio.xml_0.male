I enjoy reading about other people's lives, WAAAAY more than i enjoy reading and writing about my own. i'm not really sure why this is. but i was reading this one guy's journal and then all of a sudden a lot of stress i had was gone and i felt better about life. i think that it's kind of similar to how people enjoyed going to the movies durring wars so that they can forget about their lives for a little while and get caught up in something else. werd? 2. you know that whole kevin bacon chain effect or what not? that thing where like you're never more than 10 people away from knowing kevin bacon. (i.e. i know jane, who know's an agent in hollywood, who has a brother that worked on the set of a movie with kevin bacon..get it?). well i realized how not far away we are from people. there is this dude that i met awhile ago at the state theater conference thing, and just clicking on links to other people's blogs, within 2 clicks i was at his. and i was like WHOA weird i totally know this guy!  3. i think it's really interesting to see how another group thats similar to your own works at another school. does that make any sense? yea i think this one may be the hardest to explain. ohhh well.   so thats one thought of the day. the 2nd thought of the day i had is how fascinated i am by ear wax. does anybody know how it's formed? werd.   well i should get going i have to work now. you know, this is good for me, i can put my random thoughts in here so i wont forget about them. COOL peace out fooolks.
