Although I have a business exam on Monday, I don't really plan to revise for it (which I mentioned yesterday), so I have started my summer activities a little early. After only one evening, I have done what I had planed to do, and that was tidy. For the past 2 years, I have been doing homework and revision in our front room downstairs, which the computer is in aswell. This room proved a good place to work, as most tv watching is done in pur back room, and my house in generally quiet anyway. Well, after 2 years, the room was rather untidy, with sheets, exercise books, text books and computer equiptment scattered across the place. My mum gave me slack, my excuse being that this was how I liked to work. Now the exams are pretty much over, I had no excuse, so had to do a bit o' tidying. So, for 2 hours last night, whilst listening to 'good stuff' playlist on WMP, I gathered all my books from 2 years, all the sheets, and all the text books, and ordered them. I took all the sheets out the back of the exercise books, and stacked them all nicely. Now they are in piles on the table, waiting to be put into a box which will be put under my bed, next to another box that contains books from my junior and infant school. I don't like throwing things away. :)  Well, the room now looks pretty good, and when I went to do something else, it struck me. What else actually is there to do? Err... I do have a list written down somewhere, I could look at that. Stuff on there generally needs help from my friends, such as build a zeplin, and a trebuchet. I'll learn Esperanto more, that's actually quite fun, but I want to use the computer as little as possible, mainly because it's unhealthy. I could go out with friends, but oooh. Tough. I last went out with friends at least 3 months ago, possibly more. Yep, I am that lonely. Well, I'm going to Thorpe Park on Tuesday, and that will be good. I'm going with  urlLink nonnesuch ,  urlLink megatrobe , steve and rob. Got fairly cheap tickets too, Â£18. But that's still a lot. Just cheaper than the normal price.  So, what else have I been doing? Oh yes, I've taken to listening to foreign radio stations, just for the fun of it. I've been listening to  urlLink KQED  mainly, (it's from California) but also something from Germany, from  urlLink here . The newsreaders speak quite slowly and clearly, so it's not actually that hard to understand. I can pick out the odd word, but I don't know why I bother, as I was trying to forget the language. Well, I'm sad, I know. :)  That's about all for now, cherio all.   Weather:  Thin overcast  Reading:  Harry Potter 4  Listening to:  KQED  Watching:  Nowt  Confused about:  What to do  Annoyed with:  Nowt really  Mood:  About normal
