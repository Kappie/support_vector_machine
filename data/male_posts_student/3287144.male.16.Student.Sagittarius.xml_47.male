While in town I met some 'friends' - the sort that are alright really just they can be an embarrassment to themselves at times (if you are one of those people... well lets just hope your not).  Also I had to cook myself lunch and dinner, and on both occasions I cooked twice as much as what was needed which has left me feeling somewhat tired. On a final note this weekend is the 60th anniversary of D-Day; a day when no one is sure whether they are celebrating or 'commemorating'. Shame really, anyway, over and out.
