He was realllllly not in the mood to go to sleep so he didn't. He just sat at the computer and did nothing. But then he talked to Kinker for ummm a long time. Until after 3 AM. They didn't really talk about much at all but it was still for a good 2+ hours. Tyke ate some food and realized that eased sadness for a little while, at least until the food ran out. Then he sat there again doing nothing but an occasional message to Kink. It ended up being alright but then Tyke realized he should really go to bed. He wasn't the least bit tired though. Not even yawning at all. So he went to his bathroom and took a vicodin cuz that makes him feel good and sleep as well. It worked pretty well he thinks. Hopefully he doesn't become addicted though, that would be malnutritious. Well he went to sleep and was awaken to Macaroon's phone call at noon saying he was free at night. So Tyke said cool basically and that was that. Then Tyke was awake so he drained the MW (that doesn't mean jerking off if you thought it did) and decided he was just going to go back into bed. He turned on Not Another Teen Movie on ComCent and then just watched that until 2 PM. So by this point it was already the afternoon and he had been out of bed for about5 minutes. But he finally got out and took a shower. Nothing really changed so he went upstairs and tried to find something fun to do but he couldn't. So he played the piano and lifted weights. He did a lot of curls and wrist rolls today, along with the usual crunches. Being bored/sad at least makes him want to work out which is a good thing. The day was pretty uneventful which is how they are shaping up for the most part this summer. By the way Tyke's summer is super short this year. Shortest ever. Tyke has apparently been blogging for 47 minutes but really he has just had this window open that long. But Tyke has been explaining a dream he had last night which was totally awesome but terrible to wake up to. Tyke probably shouldn't go into the details of the dream but now he realizes that it might not be so bad. It was a really good dream. Probably wouldn't be that funny but maybe Tyke would tell it funny. Hmmm...Tyke's gonna ask Kinker if he should tell it. Well, here's how Tyke's gonna do it. He of course wants to tell the dream cuz for some reason Tyke loves sharing his personal details to everyone. Well, he'll just do it now. Tyke had ended up in some weird movie theater seated with "a girl" on his right and for some weird reason Jew was on his left but the seats were sort of like a "sectional couch" so Jew wasn't very close but the girl was. There was something blocking the screen from being seen by this girl so she was always leaning over towards Tyke to be able to see. She was fully in front of Tyke's face and he was loving it but he knew she was doing this on purpose. It was weird that Tyke was able to pick up signals from the girl in his dream. But the movie sorta stopped playing and everyone else started just going about their business in the theater so Tyke and the perty girl next to him started flirting somewhat and just talking. They were already really good friends so they had plenty to talk about. They started being more physically flirty and eventually started to do that "walking with your fingers thing" on the other person. The girl started doing it to Tyke and then she got a little more adventurous and meandered down to Tyke's groin and tapped "him." Tyke sorta jumped and laughed. Then they laughed together and referenced these previous times in their friendship where Tyke told her that she touched his penis but she didn't think she did. Tyke used his fingers to crawl up her arm and up her shoulder and then found his way to her bosom and then they laughed again because the girl had told Tyke sometimes he had touched her bosom on accident because of the whole penis touching thing. So they shared some more laughs and then she got up off her knees (sounds bad yeah but it wasn't like that) and leaned in and kissed Tyke on the cheek. She for some reason wasn't on the cream colored "couch" anymore but was kneeling on her knees while Tyke just sat up on the couch leaning forward to talk to her. He wasn't super taken aback by the kiss as it was only on the cheek but he knew that at this point he finally had gotten what he wanted. The two had broken down their barriers and were progressing into something Tyke wanted. They cuddled for the rest of the dream and occasionally she would kiss Tyke on the cheek again but never on the lips, except for a graze once. It wasn't a sensual dream so much as a very emotionally satisfying dream. Tyke finally got what he really wanted from the girl and he felt so at peace with everything. No sex, none of that mumbo jumbo, just talking and flirting. They knew what the other wanted and it was just so special. But Tyke did wake up later from the dream and realized he was still in the same situation as before. It hurt a little for sure. Well that was pretty much the dream. But now Tyke has to talk about the night. Kinker, MSwa, Dr. Phil, and Macaroon came over and played poker. Tyke lost 20 initially but Macaroon owed him 6 so he got his losses down to 14 for the day. Then he played MSwa heads up in 31 and won 5 bucks there. So he was only down 9. But he got even more good news later on. Piggy J im'd Tyke saying that he remembered that he owed Tyke 8 bucks from a lunch Tyke paid for at the end of the school year. So Tyke will be getting 8 more back. He really only lost 1 today then. That's nice to think of. And so is that dream. So now Tyke is going to do that. Too bad Naan and Tyke didn't hang out but he thought she was going to call her tonight. Oh well, sometime soon hopefully.
