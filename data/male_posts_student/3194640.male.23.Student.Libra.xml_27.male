I told him what the problem was and the guy on the phone asked me if I had checked my gas cap. I said no. He said "9 time out of 10 a loose gas cap is the reason that light comes on." I checked my gas cap. It wasn't loose. I unscrewed my gas cap anyway and tightened it again. It didn't change anything. It's just my luck that it wasn't the gas cap. I will be taking it into the shop tomorrow. Luckily my car is still under warranty so I won't have to pay for anything. They told me the problem isn't serious, so I'm hoping my car doesn't blow up while I'm driving to school.  I took my ethics quiz yesterday. I don't believe I did very well. I thought I was prepared... but I wasn't. I really loathe that class...  Ending on a good note, I got my  urlLink Gmail  account. It only cost me a Ben Folds Five single.
