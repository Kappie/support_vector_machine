Forget the debates forget the music (which is shit) forget the family sticking together, forget the problems they have each had: Its total shit. Its so shit people think its good. Its the kind of shit that Satan has done right in the middle of the carpet of your living room stamped a name on it and sent it in to your mind via the airwaves and Satan's own personal implement of power (the tv). No arguments any complaints about this is because you are lying to yourself or you hang out with rockers who think the american music scene has enough to even be able to approach the british music scene with its ass lubed up and a rubber gag on its mouth. Don't even say shit about how he was born here and lives here. He spent the majority of his life in america, the family is american so basically he's american for fuck sake don't argue. Seriously no joke the Osbournes suck. There are no exceptions in the osbournes case of where this is not true. Blame the Kerrang magazine for there shitty A-list of whos rock and not because its wrong. Jack and Kelly are little incest loving drug fuckers for the record. Sharon has done nothing so she can fuck off as well.
