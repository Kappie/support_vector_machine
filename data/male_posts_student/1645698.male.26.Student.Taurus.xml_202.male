The comic still isn't updating, so I'm thinking about reseting it. Hopefully it doesn't come to that. I was playing this awesome game of Starcraft tonight, until I lost. I was playing with Josh, it was us against three comps, and they beat us into a corner, I tried to defend and attack back. They eventually broke my defense when I decided to go Archon. It wasn't worth it. That was that. Last few words: Yo Menwa, I read your mail and saw the pics, they were great. Yo I am redesigning this site soon, wanna help me? -Peace Out from The Box Under The Bridge
