So many movies today just sluff off character development as a waste of time, but this movie (and many Westerns in general) showcased character development as its heart and soul. Of course the cinematography was awesome. I highly recommend this movie.  ["Datura," Tori Amos, 1999]    I'm going to call Jake Woods sometime today and talk with him. I was really hoping that I would have had time this summer to go see him in Wisconsin, but that just didn't work out. I'm thinking about the possibility of a few days during spring break of next year, but I'm not sure yet. He was asking me a while back if I've really gotten involved with any organizations here at the medical school and while I've looked into a whole lot of groups I can't say that I've invested heavily into any. Med school is just very different from undergrad. Since I'm a med student and also in the school of public health, my time is more strained than most other students, not in a bad way. I so far enjoy the program that I'm in, but I'm going to be way more cautious about what I dedicate myself to outside of the classroom. Besides, it took a year of bouncing around at Duke before I found the EMT option, so I'm in no rush to committ.  ["Ode to a Butterfly," Nickel Creek, 2000]  Have a good sunday, everyone.  Recommended song: "Haunted," Poe, 2000.
