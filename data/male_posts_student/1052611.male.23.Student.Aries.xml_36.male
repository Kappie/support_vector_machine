Can't really blame me though. The whole week is spent in keeping up with school or writing records or something so...where is the time to study for a test? And the reason gains even more justification when the subject for the test is organic chemistry!  My tuition batch consists of roughly about 26 students. Young, zealous, waiting to be moulded, desperate to learn more... are some of the characteristics that you might link with a bunch of 16,17 (18??) year olds. Well, look at it optimistically(as my dad would say) . You might have been even further away from the truth. Except for the young part, the other parts are pure elephant's shit.Zealous be damned and desperate to learn? YE GODS! I've never seen a more disinterested bunch of gargoyles.For example, today for the test; only half the class turned up;and out of the half that did turn up 5 people gave up on the one and a half hour test after about ahem.. 20 minutes. And mind you this is a drastic improvement; back in April it used to be 10 minutes and believe me I'm (for once) NOT exaggerating. Not that they are dumb or anything...just plain disinterested and I hate it when I've to sit for 3 hours in the sort of environment where everyone looks like hey its Buffy the vampire slayer time and look its the return of the decaying zombies!!The chemistry teacher obviously doesnt offer big time contribution since, as a bonus, I also get to hear her drawl on forever about the preparation of RDX!!( I mean to say RDX,the explosive)what the hell were those CBSE dudes and dudettes thinking anyway? Anyone would think that they wanted India to be full of terrorists or kidnappers(yeh, we did cholroform too) .  I know what you are thinking (you= general junta)..you are thinking get a life ya moron! If you don't have anything to write about then say it straight! But alas! the numerous history papers that I've written in my previous years of err ''education'' make sure that I say anything 'if and only if' I've about a gazillion ways of beating around the bush and then slowly, gradually WHEN the need arises, make half hearted attempts to get to the point!  The fact is, that my life currently revolves (or apparently revolves) around academics; so bear with moi woes, fellow earthlings is all I can say.  Anyway you can let the fresh air in now; I just caught sight of the Floyd-Relics album on my table. The music has a slight weirdness to it but then it is Floyd and whats more, its brilliant!There is this song called 'remember a day' that is currently on my hitlist.  Climb your favorite apple tree Try to catch the sun Hide from your little brother's gun Dream yourself away -Floyd.
