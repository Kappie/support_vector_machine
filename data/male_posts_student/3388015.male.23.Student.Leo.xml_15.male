I woke up this morning 20 minutes late, so I was rushed out the door without lunch (I grabbed a couple cereal bars Cindy gave me last week).  I've been changing my address for different things in my life to the new apartment, bank, credit cards, paypal, etc when I came across a promotion for a VISA World Shopping Tour in Milan, Paris, London, Buenos Aires or Tokyo.  All I have to do is use my VISA debit card... a lot.  It's worth $150,000 and includes accommodations for four people, so I could take three friends.  I'm trying to think who I would take.  I would of course take Laura and Cindy.  But who to take as the 3rd?  I could take Jake, but I don't know how much fun he'd be on the trip.  There are a couple other people I could take, but I just don't know.  This is a hard decision.  I'll have to think about it more.  Maybe Laura and Cindy and I could just go and we could spend the extra money they'd give us for not taking a 3rd person?  How nice it would be to travel the world and be free.
