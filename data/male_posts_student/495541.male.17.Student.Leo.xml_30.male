I choose to post now because of this:  Zneval 2K2: UPDATE BLOG DAMNIT  It seems someone really likes to read this blog.  Anyways, I really don't have much to say.  Today is Monday.  Monday's are mostly not very good.  This morning I didn't feel well at all.  I thought about staying home.  I figured it would be nice since I had to present my speech today in Language Arts.  Don't get me wrong.  I wasn't thinking about staying home purely for that reason.  I honesly didn't feel well.  Well I went to school anyways.  Oh well, I'm fine.  Things are mostly going fine.  I'm working on switching my internet host for halbe.org.  I already signed up for a cheaper, better service that supports PHP.  That should be cool once I get it working.  Then I can have subdomains as well.  If I ever get a Couter-Strike server (which will probably be never) then I could set up an alias subdomain like cs.halbe.org.  Now that would be pretty w00t.  Staying on the subject of Counter-Strike, I'm in the clan C/A if you already didn't know.  Check out my stats  urlLink here .  I'm decent.  Not too great but I'm OK.  Bye
