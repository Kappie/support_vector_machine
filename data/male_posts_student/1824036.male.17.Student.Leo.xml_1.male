Actually, I had it on mute while I was on the phone with my tech geek friend.  I saw Eddy Guererro and John Cena seeiming to have a promo-fest...apparently they're going to have a match later.  I also missed most of the Rey Mysterio-Nunzio match, which sucks because Rey Rey is one of my favorite wrestlers...anyway, Rey Rey won.  Up next is Benoit- A-Train...In the middle of the match, Albert pulled off the turnbuckle pad.  Benoit then hit a German Suplex and a headbutt from the top rope.  Prince Albert kicked out of the pin and ran Benoit into the exposed turnbuckle.  Benoit kicked out of the pin attempt, the ran A-Train into the steel.  Crippler-crossface and a tap and Benoit wins.  The replay shows he had his foot on the rope though.  Back from commercial break, A-Train jumps Benoit in the back with Rhyno's help and knocks Benoit out.  Meanwhile, someone has stolen the tires off of Eddie's low-rider.  He gets into a shoving match with the FBI until APA breaks it up.  When did Guerreo become a face, anyway?  HERE COMES THE PAIN!!!  Lesnar struts out to the ring.  He still gets a good pop from the fans.  He proceeds to tell the fans, "SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN!"  He proceeds to throw a tantrum because he tapped out at SummerSlam and calls it a fluke. "I'm not a quitter, dammit!"  He proceeds to put over his SummerSlam match as something that will never happen again, and demands a re-match.  Kurt Angle appears on the Titan-Tron and begins to mock Brock in an obvious pre-taped segment.  He calls Brock a "whiny little bitch".  Angle is obviously borrowing from Flair's book and overusing the "Whooo!" thing.  Out of nowhere, DEAD MAN WALKING hits and the Undertaker comes out.     Taker proceeds to preach the rules of the yard..."You were in front of the line, now you go to the back of the line.  And it's been a long time since Big Evil's had a title shot.  You got a problem leaving the yard, I'll be glad to help ya!"  Which brings the Big Slow to the ring.    Paul Wight still can't handle a mic to save his life.  "I'm 7 foot 2 500 pounds..."  BORING...he claims he's the #1 contener when Angle's music hits...  YOU SUCK!!   Angle says he doesn't give a damn who he faces.  he says he'd love to make Brock tap out again, then turns to the Undertaker and says it would be an honor to make him tap in his yard.  He proceeds to insult Show's body odor when Steph's music hits.  Steph is calling the shots tonight and makes a triple threat match with Taker, Show, and the Pain.  Back from commercial, Cena rhymes about how he never touched Eddie's car.  (My money says Chavo did it...)  Anyway, Cena's music hits, and he's got a tire from Eddie's car.  Before he can bust a rhyme, Eddie jumps him.  Cena gets busted up early.  (Now I realize why Eddie is a face, they're in El Paso; Eddie's hometown.)  Eddie does a good job of dominating the match, until missing a dropkick, when Cena takes over, briefly.  Eddie goes right back on the offense, only to find Cena was playing possum.Eddie throws in the tire that Cena brought out...while the ref was throwing it out, Eddie smacks Cena with a chair, then goes for the froggy.  Cena rolls out of the way and we go to commercial...  Back from comercial...Cena has full advantage, but misses the pinfall.  He pulls off a nice press-suplex, but Eddie kicks out again.  Cena slaps on a sleeper-hold but Eddie comes back, and Latino Heat fires up.  Eddie reverses an FU, and goes for the pin, but Cena kicks out.  The crowd is firmly behind Eddie.  Cena hits a low-blow and gets disqualified.  Then he wraps his chain around his hand and abuses the hell out of Eddie.Cena pulls the tire in the ring and FU's the US Champ on it.     Word Life.  Anyway...they're putting on the highlights from last weeks Brock beatdown on Zach Gowen...And HERE COME'S THE PAIN!  and it's a Big Bad Show tonight...(rolling eyes) DEAD MAN WALKING!  Apparently Show and Lesnar are in cahoots for this match.  But Angle comes out and takes his place next to Tazz and Moron Cole.  And then a commercial.  (this is the first time I've ever typed out a play-by-play wrestling thing, and i gotta tell you, my fingers are getting sore.)  Brock and Slow are double-teaming Taker.  Big Slow just pulled off a very nice suplex on Taker.  Amazing!!  Big knows how to do a wrestling move...anyway, Brock and Show get into it until Taker gets back in the ring and takes care of business.  Brock goes for an F-5 on Taker, but Slow, breaks it up.  He goes for a chokeslam, but Takerv turns it into a submission hold, which Lesnar breaks up.    The action spills outside the ring.  Brock puts Taker up for the F-5, but Taker jumps out and throws Brock into the ring post.  Big Slow comes up from behind and whacks Taker and Lesnar with a steel chair.  The we go to commercial...  Back from commercial...we have Big Slow and Undertaker in the ring, with Brock writhing outside until he breaks up a submission hold that Taker had on Slow.  Undertaker choke-slammed Brock, but Brock kicked out.  WOW!!!  Lesnar pulls off a beautiful vertical suplex on the Big Slow.  Taker breaks the count though.  Brock turns around and F-5's Taker, but the Slow breaks the count.  Big Slow goes for a top rope Choke slam on Brock, but Undertaker breaks it up.  Undertaker goes for a Last Ride on Brock, and Taker gets the three count!  Undertaker is facing Kurt Angle next week for the WWE Championship!  As the show goes off the air, Undertaker and Kurt Angle stare eachother down....
