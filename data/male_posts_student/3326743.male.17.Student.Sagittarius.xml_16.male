Hey Moses, I'd like to see some of those songs you've been writing. It seems like that's all I've been doing this summer is writing song after song. Well, I went to the "Quieting a Noisy Soul" conference hosted by Jim Berg and God really put a mirror in front of my face. Needless to say it wasn't what I wanted to see but exactly what I needed to be shown. Right now, I guess you could say there's been a passage from Jeremiah that's haunting my thoughts. Jeremiah 2:20-21 has been such a harsh-truth reality check. I understand just how much time I've wasted and strain I've hoarded up within being a strange vine to God. I mean this verse is like a biography of my spiritual life. It seems one moment I'm saying, with a desire to do, "I will not transgress" and then as soon as I turn my back on myself I'm off to my favorite tree or hill. I know people say this a lot but, I need a lot of prayer (I know we all do) but I really desire to be a noble vine again but my heart is so unfaithful. I'm almost finished with the book of Mark and that's been a huge blessing. Right now, I guess I'm working on that face in the mirror and with God's help (and a little prayer support) I truly desire to be a wholly noble vine in God's eyes.
