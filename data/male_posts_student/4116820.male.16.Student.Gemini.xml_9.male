By the way does any one know who the judge was? Lance Ito perhaps, I mean if he lets "The Juice" off with murder i'll bet he'd let good ole Martha off with a little Insider Info. I wonder what the possibility is that she'll decorate her cot, cell bars (in a "festive" candy cane color) and have some loser bring his pets in. So, who gets to take care of her 20 cats while shes in the pokey, and another question if you're under house arrest and you name is Martha Stewart do you go to your summer home or weekend getaway if it's waterfront is the water offlimits? So many questions so little time.
