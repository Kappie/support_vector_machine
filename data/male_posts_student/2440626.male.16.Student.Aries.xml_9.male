Pretty exciting! I also learned something very valuable this week.  Your opinion on a certain someone, that you thought you knew very well...can change...really quick.  I guess it just makes you re-evaluate your original judgment about that person.  They say not to judge a book by its cover; but through my experience, the cover is an excellent criterion for judgment.  Wow, that was deep.  I have to go do something less intense.  Over and out.  By the way...it is just starting to snow.
