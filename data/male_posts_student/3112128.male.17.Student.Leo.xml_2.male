Frank, who spotted the rising trend in the summer of 1994, informed the woman standing next to the man buying the tyre that she ought to purchase herself “a casket or a tax book”, in preparing for what he calls, “the Die and/or Can’t afford to buy” revolution.  Walsh is not the only high profile taxation officer predicting this somewhat dramatic shift in the preferred metaphysical basis of populism. Bob Lough and his taxation team at Unemployed Accountants International, have been training a budgerigar from ‘Tim’s Pets and Pet Accessories’, to formulate an algorithm to predict the popular trends in the main stream senile culture- including lawyers and dentists. This budgerigar has predicted an identical trend to that of Frank Walsh’s, which indicates the truth in this seemingly sensible prediction.  Another side to this new to be fashionable trend, is the methods in which one performs these soon-to-be popular acts. Just how does one die fashionably? To answer this, one must curtail their activities and get themselves along to the trendiest crematorium in town. Here it is found that the stars are all dieing with no grace- hair in a mess, nose closer to one’s ear than to one’s mouth, teeth intertwined and most importantly; drugged up. So, now we know the fashionable death, how about the fashionable tax form?  “For a modish tax return, use an outrageously coloured pen, such as red or green, or even a combination of both”, Frank claimed, “and make sure you write down only that which you can know a priori”. This last statement is where the heated debates are concentrated. Can one really be hip, if they only choose to disclose information that one knows a priori? Was Descartes cool in his time- yes, he was. In fact, after Cartesian Dualism took off amongst secular markets, Descartes was admired as a pop-culture icon. On the other hand, when we look at those who tended towards empiricism such as Locke and Hume, we find a boring group, bumbling and unpopular in the eye of the fashionable crowd. It’s hip to be analytic.  The trend of the future; we can know today. Let the trend be your friend- die and/or pay your tax, but do it the fashionable way.
