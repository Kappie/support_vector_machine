I found it extremely unnecessary for us all to wait in line so I said, "Excuse me, I must worsh my hands."  As I walked away, I over heard Matt say, "Did he just say worsh?"  I ignored the blatantly ignorant words that were pouring out of his mouth.  Honestly, what was he thinking.  Of course I said worsh.  Remember, I lived in Tennessee until a year ago?  Well, that's not the point.  The bathroom was one of those public restrooms that's only meant for one person and you're supposed to lock the door while you're using it.  Well, a few seconds after I walked in I noticed an old man on the crapper and I exclaimed, "Oh shit, sorry about that,"  I spoke only to occupy my mouth, and he said, "Oh, it's no problem, carry on..."  I was thinking, well, it would be rude if I didn't stay now because I already saw the man on the can trying to push a log out his ass and he did tell me to stay.  As I said before, I only went to the bathroom to wash my hands so I turned on the faucet, which projected the water at an unnecessaryily high velocity.  I got my hands wet and squeezed some soap on them when I realized I really had to take a piss.  So, I rinsed the soap off and dryed my hands so I wouldn't get my private areas all wet, and I went over to the urinal, and relieved my bladder.  I then had to wash my hands again, all the while this older male is still pushing that log through.  I dryed my hands and left saying as I walked out the door and jokingly said, "Hey man, good luck w/ that shit."
