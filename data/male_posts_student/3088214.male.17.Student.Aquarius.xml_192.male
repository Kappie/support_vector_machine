We have a committee planning that party and I'm not sure whether those planning people have coordinated the party to include the US history students too.  On the other hand, we have to do something special just for Ms.Clark....Maybe everyone has to sign and write a message on a card or something....As a farewell to all the dedications and years of work she has contributed to Skyview. So maybe we should have a special US history party on a different date.  In the mean time, I have to find those AP FEST committee members........
