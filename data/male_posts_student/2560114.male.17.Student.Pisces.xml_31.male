But seriously though, i try everything to plz a girl...but i just get a fucking slap in the face for my actions. I fucking get my ass left in the dust. I fucking bust my as for fucking nothing. It just pisses me off...and i feel like an idiot for doing this shit to myself and doing this shit for her. *sigh*...i guess u still like him, and i guess there isnt gonna b any change, and ive tried hard to make that change happen, but i guess my best isnt good for u...good bye
