I know it sux and ur all like shes dumb...no shes not...she jus chooses what she wants and i cant change that. She has already chosen what to do and i know it sux but i cant change that, cuz i hate bein a selfish person and i want whats best for her. So ill post some otha ish manana after my tournament so...later.  ...Just remember that if you do go out with another guy, that i will always treat you better and i will be waiting for you.
