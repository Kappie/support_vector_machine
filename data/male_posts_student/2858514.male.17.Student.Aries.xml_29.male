I arrived school at about 7:50 and found there was only few F.5 student there. So I decided togo to room 110 to have a seat and relax.  At about 8:00, some 5E students came back. They were not very nervous and talked and made jokes as usual. After 15 minutes, my friends Rossi and John came into the room. I talked with John and he was expecting to get 21 or 22 marks.  At 8:35, the most important time came. Our class teacher, Mr. Yung came into the room with the HKCEE result notices. He delivered the result notices according to last number. As I'm number 28, I received the result the notice at a quite late time. I could see when the classmates received their notices, some showed happiness, some felt amazed and some cried. When I received my notice, I first read the Best 6 mark at the bottom. Surprisingly, I got 29 marks! It was much higher than what I expected. Then I read grade by grade and I got 5A3B, a very good result. When Rossi and John received their notices, they felt frustrated since they didn't get enough mark to study F.6 in STMGSS. Then, Mr Yung started delivering STMGSS F.6 admission form. We took the forms and filled it. I chose to study Pure Mathematics and Computer Studies. And we went to submit the forms in the next room at about 9:00.  The F.6 class list would not release until 11:00. So John, Rossi and me started to talk about which schools they were going to apply for. After a few minutes talk, Rossi decided to take a school in Shan King but John decided yet.  As I had nothing to do during the waiting time, I went to other classes and asked others how many marks they got. All my friends had got very good marks, from 24 to 30. At about 10:00, I went downstairs to the ground floor to wait for the admission result.  After waiting for a long time, at 11:10, the result for science class admission was released. Most of my friends and me were admitted. But John and Rossi needed to find other schools. So they took the Joint Admission forms and left. I went upstairs to room 111 to do the admission procedures. At 12:15, all procedures were completed and I left the school.  In the afternoon, Dad and I went to buy books. I had bought most of the books. But when I checked the books at home,I found that the salesman gave me the wrong version of Pure Mathematics textbooks. So I need to replace them today. How bothersome!
