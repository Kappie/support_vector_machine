Pete, one of Styles' old roommates (who has been invited to post on the blog) Rob (Styles' current rommmate) and I hit the town for three straight nights (Fri, Sat, Sun), the middle of which was my quarter century birthday.  (Props to Joel for having it on his calendar)  Anyway, general debauchery abounded, but it's certainly not fodder for a upper-class, snotty blog such as this.   Can't decide whether to call the girl who I met last weekend.  Hmmm.  We'll see.
