Friends can be a real headache(sometimes)... hehe... my personal opinion lah... one thing, u wanto trust them fully, yet u afraid that they'll betray u... or sometimes, u dun even noe how u have offended them, that makes them so angry (speaking from experience)...  U know once, during sec 2, i really dunno wat have gone into me... i quarrel with someone considered my friend for no reason... but then i realise it's my fault? did i apologise or not? i forgotten... hehe  but frankly speaking, the education systems is sort of disruptive lah... breaking all of us up... i missed my 202 life... cuz i was really freak off with my present class... *not all of the ppl*... they detest the form teacher last yr, we finally changed... our present form teacher not bad... yet they give that kinda f***ing attitude... ai mai ai mai one... so freak man...  another thing i wanto know... why they all juz simply wun listen to the teacher during geog lesson??? they complained of mrs siva.. yah, we have our geog teacher changed... so wat now? they dun even bother to listen to mrs brenda tan... no point changing... it's a matter of attitude...  i dun wanto be sarcastic, but i have to be... i really wonder when my class will start to become hardworking? simply not near Os then work hard baz... that's too late lez... haiz... still prefer my sec 2 life... at least they all study, (i don't) but i'm push to work harder during that time...  aniwaes, u can make aloooot of friends in the near future... u may find it terrible without friends... but u will get used to it... i have only a few true friends to talk to... but... i am still fine with it... hehe...  end here, cya...
