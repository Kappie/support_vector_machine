The reason is because there are five different dialects of Spanish depending on where you live. So if we go to like Brazil or Portugal or something they might not speak the same form of Spanish that we do. That kind of a dumber because we might have to learn 4 more types of Spanish.       And I was also thinking about learning Latin, although it may be considered a "dead language" that's the main reason why I want to learn it and the fact that if you know Latin then you can pick up on words in different languages, because most languages are derived from Latin. And my Aunt Lisa was saying that "You should know Latin because, if you take another languages it will be easier to understand, because most languages are derived from Latin." But yeah that would be cool, there was actually one point and time in my life when I want to be a Linguist so I could travel the world and be able to communicate. So I guess if I learn as many languages as I can then I might be a linguist. ^_^ I really want to go to Japan and China but the Japanese and Chinese languages are two of the most advance and difficult languages in the world.                       Chichi I wonder what life will be like when you go to NJ for 5-6 weeks, But just in case you wanna send me some thing like a letter here's my address (although you probably already know it) 2700 Western Ave. *zip* 60466 feel free to send me a letter when you get the if you wanna talk and I will try to write you back.    *^* muah*^*
