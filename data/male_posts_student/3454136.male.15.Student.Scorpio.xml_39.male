I met a really interesting person on Fairyland. Her name's Shannon and she lives in Washinton State. I can really open up to her and I find her so interesting that I want to read her like a book. Does that sound strange? Anyways, if I really wanted to, I can go on and on telling u what I no about her. But, I won't. =D.  It's so strange sometimes, how a total stranger can become such an important person in ur life in an instant. I really enjoy talking to her. More so than perhaps even my closest friends(that doesn't mean I don't love u anymore... u no what I mean). Maybe it's because she's a total stranger. If I had to open up to someone who nos me, I'd have to get them to unlearn what they already think they no about me first. But to Shannon, I can start whereever I want.  I never really went to those online chatrooms, but I wonder if I would've had a similar experience if I did. I don't think so though. It's o so difficult to find someone who'll accept u as u r. I've always struggled with that. That's y I thank God for Shannon.  Anyways, almost all my Cotton Yarns are Cloths now. So, cya next time. (Bows and exits)
