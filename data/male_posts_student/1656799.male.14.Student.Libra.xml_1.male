Veeeeery excited about it all tomorrow and am thinking of writing plenty of stuff on the three hour trip there. After that I have no idea whats going to happen but I'm pretty sure we'll get straight to the boat, unpack, then have a look around Salcombe.  I'm sure Monday will be spent doing fun fun stuffs and I promise to get many pictures, as I have eight charged AA batteries with me on my trip, however I have a nagging feeling that that is not going to be enough.  I bought a new shirt today in town which apparentely looks teh secks, sooo I'll wear that quite a bit.  Now I'm going to rip cLOUDDEAD onto my computer and listen to the coolio avant garde rap fo' shizzle.  (I promise that when I return there will be a mega update with lots of stuff, including photographs which I intend to kill my webspace, extracts from my journal and re-telling of the whole adventure.)  Toodles.
