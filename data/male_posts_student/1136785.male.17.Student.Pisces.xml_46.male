These six weeks of class day in and day out have really worn on me, especially considering that I didn't even have a weekend size break between my last final and the beginning of this program. Essentially I went and tacked ten more weeks of classes onto my junior year. Still not over for me yet. I am really beginning to loathe actually going to class. Being far from home is something I can deal with, if still annoying; but this is really starting to get on my nerves. Which means I don't pay enough attention in class, which begins to defeat the entire purpose of spending ten weeks here. I just, just need a break. The weekends don't feel nearly long enough.   Oh well, had to do this sometime.  Only four more weeks. That's a good thought I guess. Than three weeks of 'freedom', then school. Cool.  I'm beginning to worry that class may not be all that it could be, and that Latin is to blame. For the past few weeks of heard increasing bitching and whining of the head teacher's superficial methods, and I've brushed it off. I mean for god's sake, we're learning Arabic here. Chill out. But now I'm thinking that the reason I haven't complained or noticed is because I've never learned a language completely before. I've been taking latin since seventh grade, and I've never known a different learning method. With latin, it's entirely expected to use english constantly in tandem with Latin, to discuss the grammar methods only in english, and well...to use English. We don't speak latin, so there is no way around it. But you can speak Arabic. Maybe we should be using it more. That's how the French and Spanish classes work at school - they phased out english entirely a long time ago. Maybe it's just never occurred to me.   Speaking of Latin; I need to get back to studying. Someone has to. I won't let this year be dominated by one person. And I won't let some new person show me up either. If I can't motivate myself through aspiration for success, maybe I can do it through hate and jealousy. Whatever works.  At least I don't have luck like  urlLink this . Jesus christ. This is the last thing we need - Great Whites smart enough to work in pairs. The ocean just got a whole hell of a lot more scary. And there's something terrifyingling omninous about "'If they've tasted human blood, then they'll remain a problem until we've tracked them down,". I don't know if that or  urlLink inter-species  cooperation is worse.  Gonna put up a Boring, yet important later, I think. Maybe not. Keep an eye out. It's not like anyone but me reads them. But the force me to keep abreast. Just so fucking tired.
