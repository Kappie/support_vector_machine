I never have any luck with anything, especially when it has to do with a relationships,   it seems liek i am pursuing nothing, and for no real reason either.  I feel like my whole life is pointless and i will never truly find happiness.  Why should i not find happiness, I dont hink I'm a bad person, i help ou tothers and try to put others before myself but to know avail.  I just think that I would really be better of dead.  I want to not be depressed, but at every turning point Im pushed further away... so really why bother? You're told that you are trapped below And dark signs helped to prove You got to reach further  For what life shall provide
