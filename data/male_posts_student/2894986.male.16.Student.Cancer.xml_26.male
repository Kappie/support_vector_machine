We no longer have to go until June 2, instead we get out the Friday before Memorial Day, May 28th. Damn staright they should allow us the remember our veterans with out having to remember school matters at the same time. The only drawback is that we will lose two days in class to prepare for the exams. I'll take the trade though. Guess I will actually have to study at home.   In other school news, Mr. John Price has become Teacher of the Year for the second time. Must have been the White Castles and pizza. A little bribery never hurt anyone.   Might as well do a soccer overview while I'm at it. Record: 6-0 Goals: 5 (+2 U-19) Assists: 5 Goals Against: 5 Goals For: Ummmmmmm..alot. Lets see...7+11+3+2+6+4= 33  Games Remaining: Jtown. @Marion County
