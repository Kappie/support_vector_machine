It goes to show that entertainment today is ruled mostly by people that apparently "look good", but have no fucking talent at all. Actually, I think that Hillary Duff is a giant bag of living and breathing shit. This brings me to a great idea I came up with. First, I win the lottery big time. I mean millions of fucking dollars. Then I spend a bunch of money on getting an entire set of diamond teeth. I will have all my real teeth removed, screws set in my jaw, and then the diamond teeth installed. Every rapper in the world would shit his pants when he saw my teeth. I could be in all kinds of movies because what movie wouldn't be better if it had a guy with all diamond teeth in it. I wouldn't need talent at all because my image would erase the need for that. Which brings my back to my original statement. It's not just Hillary Duff that sucks, it's all these stupid fucks that I see all the time on TV. Everyone could be just like them if they could sink to the level of getting by solely on their image. Some may say that I am just jealous because I am not one of those people, but that is not the case. I would hate to be one of them, because I would have to live with knowing that I was a talentless piece of shit that totally sucked and then I would have to kick my own ass.
