What she said I didn't say, and I'm sorry for the trouble it caused. I cried for over an hour about that and another issue that came up within five minutes of this happening. Luckily for me, not all hope was lost when my trusty friends such as Mojo, Kate  Virginia. I couldn't have pulled through without you guys. I didn't feel like sleeping, so I stayed up till 5:30 then basically passed out for an hour. At school I immediately ran to Megan who calmed me down and talked to me, so the day improved. I'll post about the beach in a few
