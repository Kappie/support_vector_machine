He tried cutting taxes and cutting social programs, but it didnt work.  Also, he was in power during the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, but what did he do to educate the public about the problem?  Nothing.   Also, people say he was great because he wasnt an "intelectual," like George W.  Isnt that a nice way of saying he was stupid?  I hardly see how that was a good thing.  ~Joseph Liberman
