We( me,sathiya's mum,sathiya n his big bro ) went to eat at the nearest  coffeeshop .. his mum treat us  satay .. damn delicious.. Thank You!!.. after that,i decided to go home coz i need to go home n study my  Accounts .. But in the end i didnt.. i used the com..   and i found out an ugly truth.. my klasmate told me through  MSN  that he also like the gal that i told him i like.. but he say that i can take her coz i like her more.. i do not need pity from him.. cant believe he told me that.. i actually regarded him as my  goodfriend  even though i just know him.. looks like the phrase  'true friends are hard to come by'  is actually precise..  disappointed.betrayed.anguish . was all in my head.. looks like i just have to forget that girl.. let my so-called goodfriend woo her in peace.. Good luck.. it seems that its  getting harder n harder to breathe  as each day pass.. hope i can hold on.. n hope that i can forget that girl although i know it is seemingly impossible...
