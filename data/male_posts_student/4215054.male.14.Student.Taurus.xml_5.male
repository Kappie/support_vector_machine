Ok, If you are reading this, you might want to know about what I do, I am a web designer. I own www.consolz-crazy.co.uk . It is a gaming website with Cheats, Reviews, Previews, Release Dates and much more for PS, PS2, XBox and GameCube! The forum adress is http://consolzcrazy.forumer.com .  At the moment I am learning the webscript PHP. Some may know this to be the most difficult webscript yet (Well, maybe Java is). So I'm racking my brain at the moment.  Today has been boring. just inside on MSN all day. I fell out with two big style posters on my forum, but then I made mates again. I did my paper round like I do every Wedensday and Thursday which is really boring (Just do it for the money). My mum and dad are out at the moment so I'm still on here, this is my 9th hour on here today.  I'm really annoyed at the website, It can upload properly, but then when I have to close off, and save, it quits. So there is a big backlog of reviews, previews and cheats. I hope the regulars on the forum don't get bored...  I found out what the new chocolate Revel is today! It's Raisen!  Talk to you guys later!
