     
      I got my boys night out CD. I've paid for a large part of my digital camera. Using the money I have in the bank, I've given myself a loan and it's looking like I'll be purchasing a new car within the week. Life is going good. Although, I really am in dire need of a pedicure. My feet are disgusting, and feel as such.  And so. I am tired of these surroundings. This place. I need change. A long vacation, or a semi-permanent move, even.  If only it were that easy.  I've been feeling restless again.
