More like a I-have-an-alien-feeding-off-of-my-insides-and-it-is-ready-to-burst-out-and-destroy-mankind-and-build-an-intergalactic-empire-and-make-Earth-a-giant-alien-wasteyard-filled-with-alien-SUVs-and-RVs-and-all-kinds-of-alien-gas-guzzling-vehicles feeling.  Y'know that feeling?  Anyways, this is the part of the blog where I post something about my Italy trip.  We will go back to the first day: 13 June, 2004 and relive the randimosity.  Off we go:   So it begins.  All of the endless preparation for the past two weeks will finally pay off.    I got up and was prepared for the huge event... USA vs. Grenada in World Cup Qualifying of course!  This should have been a great match to watch because the Americans should dominate the Grenadians by at least 7 goals, but the Americans played like rubbish.  It was 0-0 until DaMarcus Beasley represented MLS and the Chicago Fire well with a goal in first half stoppage time.  The Beas would add another for the Americans and in second half stoppage time Greg Vanney added one more to make things a little more respectable.  During the game, I got my stuff packed and checked over for the last time.  I needed a few more things.  I went to Wal-Mart to get what I needed and was shocked by the total price: $6.66.  Not a good sign.  Especialy because I will be on a plane in a few hours.  I got that thought out of my head and it was off to Bloom High School to get picked up by a bus and go to the airport.  Then I thought and I told my sis, what if this was like  Final Destination?   She laughed at me, for it was a joke, and I said my last good-byes to my aunt and her family and my sis and her boyfriend and it was off to the bus.  It started to hit home on the bus.  Two weeks in a foreign country that doesn't speak my language.  At least I have a bunch of friends with me.  My good buddies Anthony, Robert, Eric, the new kid Tim, Suzie from soccer, another good friend Marissa, and the Pascarella twins who are always cool to be with.  After the bus ride, we were at O'Hare Airport.  This is where things got interesting.  We waited in line to drop our luggage off at a... luggage dropoff place and we were on our own until we had to meet to board the plane.  That meant we had about 3 hours to ourselves.  Instead of going to McDonalds as I suggested, we went straight for the boarding gate.  I got in after fumbling through the security check-in like it was my first time (it was my second) and had three hours of nothing to do.  We sat down and I started a game of Airport Soccer with the elder Pascarella twin, Stephanie.  After a few minutes of that mindless fun, the five stooges (me, Eric, Anthony, Robert, and Tim) went off to explore the airport.  That got boring quick and we went back.  Anthony and I left everyone else and walked to the other end of the airport.  There was a huge congregation of boistrous college aged frat boys.  Their plane was delayed so they were given a pass to bypass security and go get some food.  Anthony and I heard this and decided to try our luck and blend in with them in hope of getting McDonald's like my original plan.  The college congregation was so immense we never would have gotten food and gotten back to the gate in time.  We only had about 45 minutes left.  We decided to go back to the gate and starve.  After a while of conversation, it was time to board the plane.  Off we go...  Our seats were scattered so I had no idea who I would sit next to.  I could be sitting with the guys or I could be between two fat dudes.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I would spend the next 8 hours sitting next to the Iacopelli's.  There were little TV screens on the back of the seats so we could watch movies during the flight.  I watched BBC World news and after that they played highlights of the European Championships.  Greece shocked Portugal with a 2-1 win and Spain won 1-0 over a flat Russian side.  Then it was movie time.  There wasn't much interesting on so I decided to watch  The Girl Next Door  with Kim Bauer from "24".  I didn't want to seem like a perv though.  Oh well, it wasn't terrible.  It was like a normal movie aimed at teens.  After a while I tried to sleep.  I didn't sleep much, but I did sleep some.  I woke up and my feet were numb, my eyes hurt, and the back of my head was burning up.  Later was breakfast time.  We had orange juice with muffins and yogurt.  We were over Birmingham so there wasn't alot of time before we got to London.  Minutes before we landed the plane was low to the ground so we could see the city from the window.  There was green pastures everywhere with town homes with red roofs.  When we were close to landing, Marissa and I took a picture and before we knew it, we were in London.   Day 2 tomorrow.
