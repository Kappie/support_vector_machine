Now I must beat FFX-2... cause that game is really cool... 2004 will be a good year for gaming... im gettin a new computer, some new games and more money (money not expected to show up hehehehe) Clerks is a good movie and TV show...  um... yea... we start school again on Monday... not cool xD oh well... I cant wait til Kingdom Hearts 2 comes out, it looks so cool... and the GBA one too... ah... Ill be in KH bliss once those come out... oh well, guess I gotta wait til the end of the year...
