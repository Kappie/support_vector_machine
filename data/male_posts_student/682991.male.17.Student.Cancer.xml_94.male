It's some screwed up language setting, stupid American software. It won't let me use British English as the default language for the whole computer. All of a sudden, it just dawned on me last night that the problem lay there. So I fixed it. Oh, I've added a shoutbox too, for those of you who are in a hurry, or who aren't in the blog yet. (Why aren't you?!) Enjoy what's left of our holidays, study hard!
