Haha, I guess Bloody Roar 4 had made me think of anime a lot.   ~ Skipping school again as I have no exam today. Today, I'm determined to start a new PS game and revise my Mandarin, Japanese followed by Econs and Commerce. I don't know whether I can finish the syllabus, but I'll try my best. I don't think I would have time for Gunbound today. Even if I have, I would only play for an hour or so.   Hereby is the lyrics for the song 'Believing' by The Calling from their brand new album II: (I like this song a lot, the lyrics are meaningful too)[Thanks to http://www.azlyrics.com for the lyrics]   Believing    I'm one man to  make a difference   I'm one soul all  persistence   In a  dark world , just trying to make things right   Choices  we weren't given  Any heroes, and  our decision   Is to  stand up  and  fight for ourselves    [Chorus:] To be  free   Is  all we want  to be  When everything  seems so far  out of reach  But  I know , no matter where we go  I'll  never stop believing  in me   Woke up  bent  and  broken   Just to find that  fate has spoken   And I call out I call out for a  change   For every  moment  that remains  For every  sinking stone  to find its place  Long before they're  washed away    [Chorus]  We've been  waiting  for too long  We've been  giving  in to wrong  And we've been  broken to pieces  one by one   We're  gonna know   We're gonna know   When the moment comes    [Chorus]
