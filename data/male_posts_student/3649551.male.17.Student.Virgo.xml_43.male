But then I think about how long it would take to learn to play a violin well. Just think of how absolutely TERRIBLE new violin players sound! The thing about violins is that they make the most awful noises if you don't know what you're doing. That's really the reason why I don't try to learn. I'm not afraid of the work it would take to get to a high level. It's the fact that I would sound terrible that prevents me from really trying. The reason why I don't want to play is that I think it would depress me, trying to learn. But the reason why I want to play is that I think it would make me happy, being able to play well. If you didn't already guess from the title, that was me screwing around with some symbolism. I don't really know why; I just felt like doing it. And no, I still haven't gotten that phone call. This is me wasting time. This is me ceasing to waste time.
