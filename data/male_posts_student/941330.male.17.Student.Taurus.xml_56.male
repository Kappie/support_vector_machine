(o i'm clever...yeaaa) played some basketball with alex and some chinese guys i didnt kno, and me and alex did a lil one on one, i had some decent drives, but i'm used to my neighbor's weak backboard so all of my bank shots went off too hard. then simulated some games of nba2k3, and we had like me, abdullah, sloan, jason (with a german moustache), and kevin (who had bright red hair and black sideburns) vs. alex, eugene, owen, erik (who had eminem's hair), and pat. sloan had like 9 points! and i was balling like crazy vs. alex, crossing him over so bad...eugene got this alley-oop that bounced off the rim but erik still caught it anyway. alex was like screaming when it was game point for my team and we missed, then his side would go for a two and they'd miss. then we won and he died. figuratively.   yesterday, pe...tough stuff. we won all three games, including a championship game over jacob's team...ANKUR...got in position to get a slow grounder and the ball went through his legs. ahhh its alright lol. brunch, i found kristen (who was diligently searching for me inside the cafeteria) and signed their yearbooks...with sharpie...breaking time-honored tradition :( eng, my essay, 2 1/2 pages double sided. i never write that much, besides like in these dumb entries, so that was cool. then i went outside and talked to jenn for the first time in like ever so i was happy. elyse, parisa and amita came, and elyse told me to hate adam forever for no particular reason. i went to the back and found adam and basho for hypernet. i got my ass royally smacked cuz i cant shoot without spraying worse than kevin a while pronouncing "babelfish pepperoni." alex kept on asking questions like "who's strider?" and i'd say "sam" then he'd go "shut up." then we played with pat oooh...5 months of ferrous oxide -- i mean rust was displaced -- arrgh, shaken off in 5 minutes...me and adam were beaten 15 to like 3.  today me, basho, alex, marisa, debbie, rajan, and camilla went to great america. first we went on top gun...we saw our pics and then decided to flip off the camera at every roller coaster. we passed the spongebob show and saw samyak and saagar. samyak pointing out people..."he's gay. he's also gay. she's too short. she thinks she's black. i just hate him." in the show he called at someone outside to walk in...and then they ran away. stealth, we kept our middle fingers up the whole ride, but the picture booth was closed! aww. the girls were talking...condiments, fake food; condiminiums, fake houses; condoms, fake...you get the picture. went on vertex...basho's seat was...wet, and sharon fell onto her harness a very bad way. "isn't it only suppose to happen to guys?" we finally flipped off the camera! my eyes are closed and my tongue's out, alex is starin at the camera with his hair lookin kinda spiked, and basho is evil. soo cool. alex bought an extra to sell on ebay or something. we even got sharon and kim on it too...blackmail...then we went on the sex ride. don't ask. a lot of teenage girls were on it, except they all went on a different part of the ride. coming home, we saw a "for sell" sign. yeup...  debbie's leaving for georgia (don't worry she wont get killed by the kkk or anything) and she'll be back on july 19. mark your calendars everybody. basketball tomorrow, owen's house sunday, my's party monday...busy. gotta love summer.
