So anyway, after that I got a message from chris. We are going to Elaine's casa today. So we leave around 2:15 to be there by three cuz we though we were gonna have to walk. Yet my father comes to the resque and drives us there. So anyway we get there to prepare to walk to albertsons. The only thing we are missing is Shiela. Well she takes ferever to get ready. Damn anyway she shows up with a brother that has a car so we got a ride.  So we get to albertsons when me and Elaine go off to find some stuff while Chris and Shiela go off to get Strawberrys.  So we meet up with all the stuff and go to the self check out. We check out and as we are walking out Elaine goes " My Yohoo!". Turns out we had left it behind but it was to hot to walk back all that way so now I owe Elaine a thing of Yohoo. So we get back to Elaine's house and kick back a few when I yell out "Body Shots" Me and chris get no actions but the girls fucken go at it. DAMN, to hella hot girls giving each other bodyshots. (Even a lil more) So me and chirs left now im here talking to you im done BYE.
