Being the fact that RPG is my favorite game genre, Fable could easily become my favorite game of all time. Sure, to beat out The Legend of Zelda: Orcarina of Time would be a rare accomplishment indeed, Fable certainly has the potential to do so. Halo 2 better not leave space for game of the year just yet.
