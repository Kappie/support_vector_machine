I could not sleep well yesterday, I am still bleary-eyed. My eternal dream of watching a Formula One Race, Live, has finally turned into reality, and am I on cloud nine! The roar of those 800 BHP engines as they go from 0 to 300 kph within seconds (simply the greatest sound on this planet), the smell of the slick rubber thanks to the Bridgestones and the Michelins burning against the tarmac, a Ferrari and a McLaren driving in a perfect slipstream, the 7 second pit stops, those breathtaking passing manoeuvres, the chicanes and the spoon curves, the pit babes (whoa), and finally Schumi's trademark leap in the air on the podium followed by the burst of champagne; Aaah - its a heady feeling (forget the champagne) - I think I already see myself at the race, and as you know, I have even gone ahead and predicted the winner! And if the race itself was not enough, I also hope to be a part of the screaming and waving Tifosi. Tifosi (Italian for "to be a fan of") is a large group of die-hard Ferrari fans, and I suppose they are sorta similar to the Barmy Army, the fans of the English Cricket Team who follow the team everywhere they go. On second thoughts, I believe, Tifosi is also associated with Soccer, so its not really a Barmy Army, something not exclusive to F1, its just "Italian" perhaps. Not that I expect a lot of Tifosi at a US GP; for that I'll have to dream another dream - of going to the Italian GP at Monza someday. But I am gonna paint myself "Scarlet Red" and root for the Scuderia anyways!  To top it all, this is probably the closest championship in the past few years, with atleast 6 drivers competing for the world champion honors. The Prancing Horse looks formidable as ever, but BMW Williams is looking in great shape especially with the unpredictable duo of Montoya and Schumacher Junior, and then the Woking oufit - Ron Dennis, Adrian Newey, DC and Kimi are capable of delivering the goods anytime. The US GP is the penultimate race before the drivers and the engineers have their final tasks cut out at the Japanese GP at Suzuka, and in all probability it looks like it will all go down to the wire at Japan. This could make the visit to Indianapolis even more special, drivers competing for points and places, and I expect a lot of surprises, even if they aren't pleasant.  I hope Ferrari reserve their best for Indianapolis. Good Luck Schuey, Rubens, Todt, and Brawn! - but since I got to be politically correct, may the best driver and team win!  I can hardly wait...it does not get better than this.  I'll sign off with a Knopfler classic - it has racing as the main theme. Can somebody please ask Bernie Ecclestone to make this an official song of Formula One Racing? Okay, forget the fact that its not really "Formula One" type. But is there a better one that I don't know of?   SPEEDWAY AT NAZARETH    Artist: Mark Knopfler     Album: Sailing To Philadelphia     After two thousand came two thousand and one To be the new champions we were there for to run From springtime in Arizona 'til the fall in Monterey And the raceways were the battlefields and we fought 'em all the way  Was at Phoenix in the morning I had a wake-up call She went around without a warning put me in the wall I drove Long Beach, California with three cracked vertebrae And we went on to Indianapolis, Indiana in May  Well the Brickyard's there to crucify anyone who will not learn I climbed the mountain to qualify went flat through the turns But I was down in the might-have-beens and an old pal good as died And I sat down in Gasoline Alley and I cried  Well we were in at the kill again on the Milwaukee Mile And in June up in Michigan we were robbed at Belle Isle Then it was on the Portland, Oregon for the G.I. Joe And I'd blown off almost everyone when my motor let go  New England, Ontario we died in the dirt Those walls from mid-Ohio to Toronto they hurt So we came to Road America where we burned up the lake But at the speedway at Nazareth I made no mistake
