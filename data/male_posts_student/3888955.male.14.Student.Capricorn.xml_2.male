I can’t sit in another class with them two looking at one another,” thought Ron grabbing his rolling stomach. “And you know that ferret is just going to rub it in, when Hermione’s back is turn. I’ll pound him into lunchmeat and they will expel me because he’s the Head Boy. Dirty rotten lying ferret. He want that, probably been planning all of this just to see me get expelled. I’ll quit first.”  Ron minds think back to when Fred and George quit and left school.  “They quit and even got to join the order. Of course, if I quit I can kiss being in Auror goodbye. Well not like, I had a chance anyway. I am barely passing my classes now and no way can I get all them NEWTs’ to be an Auror. They do not want me anyway, they just want Harry. They want the Boy-who- lived, not sidekick stupid Weasley. So stupid he didn’t know his girl was cheating on him.” Ron thought looking up at the half moon.  “Feels like my heart – ripped down the middle.”  Ron hits his head on the tree while he continues to think, “Stupid”...bang...”stupid”...bang...”stupid”...bang. “Draco has probably dated 20 girls including Hermione and I haven’t even really dated one. I mean I could be the world’s worst kisser and I wouldn’t know it, and he can kiss the knickers off any of them. The Anti-Christ has my girl and I can’t do a bloody thing about it.”  “Stupid”...bang...”stupid”...bang.  “Get a grip now; plan your next move - just like wizard’s chess. I cannot stay and I don’t want to stay. Quit then. Maybe, I could get Fred and George to let me stay at their place and I can work in their shop in return. I might even try to go to a few Quidditch team tryouts for Keeper. Then who knows if I practice really hard maybe I can be on Chudley Cannons.” Ron dreams of a better future for himself.  “It won’t be easy. Of course, I’m not a Malfoy where every thing is handed to me on a silver platter. No, I’m a Weasley and I’ll just have to work hard to earn it.” Ron thought, and making his mind up as he stands and walks back toward the castle.  Ron makes his way in through the front entrance and slowly walks back to the Gryffindor tower to get his stuff to leave.  “Mr. Weasley it’s past midnight, where have you been?” demands Professor McGonagall gliding over to him with a stern look on her face.  “Oh...hi professor I was at the lake,” replies Ron not even stopping as he walks past Professor McGonagall.  “Mr. Weasley...Mr. Wealsey stop this instant. No student, even a prefect is allowed to walk on the grounds after curfew.” McGonagall angrily shouts, as she is a little bit flustered at Ron’s reaction. “I’m afraid you will have to serve a week’s detention with Mr. Filch.”  Ron wheels around and unbuttons his prefect badge before saying, “It doesn’t matter Professor, I decided to quit.”  “It certainly does matter...what do you mean quit?” asks McGonagall changing her tone from anger to confusion.  “I quit Hogwarts. I’m sorry. Here’s the prefect badge and I’m going to miss you,” replies Ron handing her the badge and then briefly hugging a confused Professor McGonagall.  “Mr....Mr. Weasley you can’t be serious.”  “Yes ma’am. I can’t stay any longer, personal reasons. So I’m going upstairs to pack and I’ll be gone in an hour or two.” Ron said, turning around and walking to the staircase with a shock Professor McGonagall following.  “Your mother, Molly, will not approve of this Mr. Weasley,” retorts McGonagall trying to keep up with Ron.  “Yeah well, it won’t be the first bloody time she yells at me. But don’t worry I’ll join the Order straight away. I ought to at least be useful for something.”  “Mr. Weasley, watch your language and stop right now,” snaps Professor McGonagall, a little bit winded as she tries to keep up with Ron.  “Sorry Professor, Hey can I call you Minerva now?” asks Ron stopping at the foot of the staircase and waiting on Professor McGonagall to catch up.  “No you may not,” snaps Professor McGonagall resizing up Ron and the situation. “Mr. Weasley perhaps it is better if we have this discussion in Professor Dumbledore’s office.”  Ron gulped for air at the mention of Dumbledore and thought it better to leave him out of it.  “If it’s all the same to you. I rather just get my stuff and quietly leave.”  “In the dead of night as it were,” said Professor McGonagall finishing Ron’s thought.  “Exactly ma’am, it just takes me an hour to pack,” said Ron smiling back at Professor McGonagall, as she understands on how he wants to leave.  “No Mr. Weasley, but I promise after you talk with Professor Dumbledore you can leave as quickly and quietly as you want.” Professor McGonagall smugly replies as she pulls out her wand and starts tapping it against her other hand.  Ron gulps more air and nods his head in defeat, as Professor McGonagall leads him to Professor Dumbledore’s office with her wand out.  “Canary Creams!”  The Phoenix statue staircase moves as Ron and Professor McGonagall ride it to Dumbledore’s office.  “Mr. Weasley, stay right here until we call for you. And I do mean right here,” firmly orders Professor McGonagall.  “Yes ma’am.”  After twenty minutes outside of Professor Dumbledore’s office, “Mr. Weasley you can come joins us.” Professor Dumbledore said, with a calm voice.  Ron slowly enters the tower office of the Headmaster. The Headmaster’s portraits are all feigning sleep, the books and shiny objects are a little bit dustier since the last time he has been in the office. He looks around the corner to see an adult red Phoenix on his perch. Behind the Phoenix is Professor McGonagall standing to the right of Professor Dumbledore, who is sitting behind his cherry oak desk.  “Hello Fawkes,” said Ron walking over to the Phoenix and petting his beak.  Over the years since being rescued and carried out of the Secret Chamber, Ron has grown to admire and befriend the resilient Phoenix. Harry is still Fawkes favorite student, but Ron is a close second.  “Please be seated Mr. Weasley,” interrupts Professor McGonagall pointing to an empty chair in front of Professor Dumbledore‘s desk.  “Yes ma’am,” replies Ron leaving a singing Fawkes and falling into the chair a little bit tired and impatient at wanting this to be over.  “I understand you wish to leave us Mr. Weasley,” replies Professor Dumbledore with a sad look in his eyes.  Ron had never got the sense that Professor Dumbledore viewed him as a favorite student of his, as he did with the twins, Fred and George, Harry, or even Hermione for that matter. Not that he did not help or show any displeasure toward him. He just never had a personal connection with the Headmaster. Ron always felt that Dumbledore viewed him as Harry’s trusted sidekick and nothing more. So lacking a personal connection, he decided it best to be formal and quick with the answers.  “Yes sir for personal reasons.”  “Would those personal reasons be because of a certain Head Girl?” asks Professor Dumbledore with a touch of sadness in his voice and coming straight to the point.  The abruptness of the question, manage to catch his funny bone. Ron had been throwing up all day and for all practical purpose was thinking and running with a tank on empty. His wit and humor seem to be the only thing working within him after that last question.  “Ha-ha...hahaha...Am I the last person to know? Ha-ha!” madly cracks Ron standing up and walking to the door as he is laughing with tears running down his cheeks. “Hahaha...cheers!”  Ron reaches for the doorknob only to have it snap back shut.  “Mr. Weasley...Ronald, my boy would you like some tea and cake,” pleads Professor Dumbledore waving his wand and creating a platter of slice cake and a pitcher of hot tea.  “Ha-ha...to be honest with you Professor I’ve been throwing up all day it seems like, so I doubt if I could hold it down.” Ron said, twisting the doorknob again to get out and wondering why he managed to start crying now of all times. “I appreciate what you are doing, but I can’t stay and I won’t. I’m of age, so if you just let me out; I’ll pack, leave, then go someplace and quietly die.”  “Before you die, how about a little Earl Grey,” replies Professor Dumbledore moving around his desk and pouring the tea into a small teacup. “It always soothes my stomach. Come on over and lets talk about it.”  Ron twists the doorknob again, and gives up as he lays his forehead against the door.  “Mr. Weasley...Ron, you are not the first person to have a broken heart. I can assure you,” calmly adds Professor McGonagall whipping up another chair for herself with her wand.  “She was different, she was special...and now she is in love with an evil ferret. Now the slightest touch or thought of her makes me vomit,” remarks Ron but as he is talking about her he remembers Hermione passionately kissing Draco again in his memory. Causing him to make a quick lunge at a small wastebasket in Dumbledore’s office.  After a few painful seconds, Ron pleads one more time with his head in the wastebasket.  “The deal...Blagh!...the deal was if I come to the office and talk then you would let me go quietly. I came, I added something to the trash, and now I’m going.” Ron remarks, standing up, wipes his face, and tries to maintain his balance. “I will still join the Order and be useful – guard duty, messenger, sacrificed pawn, or paperweight. I’ll be good for something.”  Ron walks over to the door and retries the doorknob; it will not budge. Now Ron’s anger kicks in as he remembers he is a wizard. He pulls out his wand and points it at the door.  “Alohamo...”  Professor Dumbledore is quietly sitting down, sipping his tea, and watching and listening at Ron. Just before Ron can finish his spell, Dumbledore waves his wand and retrieves Ron’s wand from across the room.  “What the...bugger!” snaps Ron looking at Professor Dumbledore put Ron’s wand next to a full teacup for Ron.  “Earl Grey really does help soothe the stomach,” replies Professor McGonagall in the most British of voices as she is sitting down beside Professor Dumbledore and sipping her tea.  Ron tries the doorknob one more time, and then acknowledges his defeat by sitting back down beside a smiling Professor Dumbledore and McGonagall.  “So tell me Ronald what are your plans after leaving us?” asks Professor Dumbledore finishing his tea and looking directly at Ron.  “I thought I stay with Fred and George, practice during my off hours and go tryout for a Keeper on a Quidditch team.”  “And what about your plans for Miss Granger?” asks Professor Dumbledore still looking directly at Ron’s eyes.  “Professor I know you are a master at Legimency, but do you mind. It’s freaking me out with you in my head. Bad enough, I’m barely in there myself.” Ron snaps, and breaking his eye contact with Professor Dumbledore.  “Ha-ha ok Mr. Weasley, but your wide arrange of emotions and feelings right now are making it difficult for me to see the truth.” Professor Dumbledore said, sliding the teacup into Ron’s hand. “Not that it matters you have always been truthful to me. So would you be willing to take a few days off from classes, instead of leaving us.”  “No Professor...I really would just like to leave Hogwarts and borrowing some emergency home study program, I rather just leave.”  “For your brothers in London,” finishes Professor McGonagall.  “Yes ma’am,” replies Ron putting the teacup down beside him.  “Actually we were thinking of letting you leave for your other brother,” replies Professor Dumbledore with a small smile and twinkle in his eyes.  “Bill?!”  “No Mr. Weasley.”  “Charlie, but he’s in Romania at the Preserve.” Ron said, waiting for the explanation from Professor Dumbledore and McGonagall.  “We have setup a 2-3 month Co-op position with the Dragon Preserve. Where Charlie Weasley your brother works at. The Co-op is a working position where you will be working at handling and taking care of dragons. I envy how much fun you will have. Now you will get a small salary each week, but you also have to work on a 20-foot scroll for us on what you have learned before coming back. Now this will be a long 3 month Co-op as you will be working there over the Christmas break.” Professor Dumbledore said, with a small smile and distant look on his face as he mentions dragons.  “Excuse me sir. Is it just me or is it Harry and me,” interrupts Ron wanting to know if he had to go beg Harry to join him in order to go.  “No Mr. Weasley, just you. Providing that you can get the Professor of Magical Creatures recommendation for this Co-op.”  “Just me?! You are not going to send Ginny and a bunch of Slytherin there a week after me, are you?” asks Ron not believing what he is hearing.  “No, Mr. Weasley for the entire 3 months it will just be you,” finishes Professor Dumbledore.  “Now you will be behind in you NEWT studies when you get back, but you will have at least 5 months before you actually take the tests, to catch up on the 2 months of school that you will miss.” Professor McGonagall adds, finishing her cup of tea and smiling at the excitement of Ron’s face.  “Really? This is real...I can leave right now?” asks Ron almost giddy at not having to drop out of school but still able to leave Hogwarts.  “After you get the recommendation from Hagrid, then you can catch the 8:00 o-clock train at Hogsmeade station to London, correction – I forgot you can Apparate and you have your license from the Ministry.”  “Yes sir, I got it after my birthday.”  “Then you can Apparate directly to the Ministry of Magic International Portkey office and they will send you directly to the preserve.” Professor Dumbledore said, tapping his finger on his cheek and stroking his long white beard. “First you have to finish your tea, mind you.”  “Yes sir,” replies Ron gulping the tea in one fell swoop then jumping up and racing toward the door to go see Hagrid.  “Mr. Weasley, you might need this,” reminds Professor McGonagall holding up Ron’s wand.  “Professors, thank you, both of you.” Ron said, racing back to the chair to get his wand and then finally leaving Dumbledore’s office.  “Whew – for a second there Albus, I almost thought he wouldn’t take the deal.” Professor McGonagall adds, exhaling in relief.  “I wonder if we shouldn’t ask again for him to stay. You do not know how important someone is to you until they leave you. I have a very bad feeling we are going to find out just how important young Mr. Weasley is to us.” Professor Dumbledore said, in a very tired voice.  “The poor boy is embarrassed and heartbroken. I do not think anything would have kept him here. If you offered him all the Galleons in Gringotts to stay, he still would’ve refused.”  Professor Dumbledore says nothing as he stands up and moves to his telescope to see Ron running out on the grounds toward Hagrid’s hut.
