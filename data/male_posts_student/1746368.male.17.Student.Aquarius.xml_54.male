I guess there is some way to put a title on it, but they don't tell us how. That would be nice, since I am kind of using the "Feeling: ____" thing as my title for now. I also have a spell checker! An English nut's best friend. I think that I will use it and make myself look smarter. I can change the date and time so I can post this in the morning when before I even wake up. I can send posts while I am at school but have already written them out here. Yea, I am weird like that. Also apparently I can put them into draft form (although, there was already a way to do that, since all you had to do was not publish it; I guess this way you can post and publish without worrying).   Well, let's get down to brass tacks (oh, I din't bwing any, I dwove;  urlLink Homestar Runner ) I will give you play by play detail of my day.  TA: Boring, I had to help other people do a lot of work with computers.  Web-Page Design: Boring, now  I  had to do a lot of work with computers.  Lunch: Food=nourishment. More computers. Went into the computer lab to see if Lenny's disk had his Visual Basic animation on it.  US History: Literally, we did nothing. She said, free period. Supposedly, yesterday, I was unexcused from Math, but I was there, so I have to get that cleared.  Home: Better; I got a ride home from my dad (as opposed to skating home). Dominique called, said her mom cut their cable. Internet doesn't work, so she won't be online. Oh well, guess that means more phone time or maybe it's less...who knows? Also she has an orthodontist appointment tomorrow, the little booger. She doesn't have to go to school  and  we can't meet for lunch. I was looking so forward to it too!  Youth: I had to go early to set up and stuff. At twenty to 6 we still weren't sound checked. We need to get started earlier on the worship team. I sang and played at the same time. It's odd how I am the only one who ever does both on the worship team. We had a good message and the crowd breaker got screwed up. Oh well, it was funny just the same.  Now I am home, and I am bored. Very few people are online and most of them aren't talking. Well, my behind is sore, so I should probably get up. If anybody has a question about my day or a comment, please leave a comment. Please though, no rude comments. I accept both negative and positive comments but please, keep it civil. Who knows who could be reading this? Besides, I hate cussing!
