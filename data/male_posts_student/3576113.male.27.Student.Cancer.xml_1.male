He's awesome reminds me of the days when I had my canine companion(s).  Over the years I've had a Black Lab (Sport), some little yappy thing (Cathy), a Pit Bull (Shadow), tree climbing Hound (Snoopy), German Short Haired Pointer (Rommel), Lab mutt (I've forgotten got hit by a car), Lab/Pitt Bull mutt (Ozzy), Lab mutt (Mr. Big - as in the band), Terrier mutt (Buddy).  Was usually the same story, mother would hold em over us saying she was going to get rid of em and then usually did.
