I guess I will be borrowing Someone else's notes I hope there's someone who showed up And did not fall asleep Why can't I be as lucky as those with no class till noon So I'm left to beg for mercy And someone else's notes  You'd think that I could find a class I'd want to go A teacher who's dynamic so the class won't seem so slow If that's too much to wish, perhaps there could be A teacher using lecture notes that are on the Web for free  I guess I will be borrowing Someone else's notes I hope there's someone who showed up And did not fall asleep Why can't I be as lucky as those with no class till noon So I'm left to beg for mercy And someone else's notes  I sit here in my room, and watch a DVD I could do that in class like lots of laptop screens I see But when I sit in class, the options ain't the same Sure I could play solitaire, but there's no sound on the game  I guess I will be borrowing Someone else's notes I hope there's someone who showed up And wrote down all the quotes Why can't I be as lucky as those with no class at all So I'm left to beg for mercy And someone else's notes
