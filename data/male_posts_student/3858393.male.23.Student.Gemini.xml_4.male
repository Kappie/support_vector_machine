You can create your character and lead them through life. You even can build their house! You can order them to do whatever you want them to do... "hehehe". A big disappointment is the fact that there is only a few changes from "Bustin' Out" and "The Sims" for PS2. In "Bustin' Out" you can leave your house, move out, and you can play a story mode... I think that if you wanna buy this game your making a bad decision because the difference is very suttle... Even if you think leaving your house would be fun, you can only do it in story mode! WTF is that?! You can't buy a car in Free Mode! That's what we've been wating for you retards! Doesn't Maxis go out into the forums that have issues with "The Sims" game... Did someone post "I want to go and drive around town. In story mode only though... Yeah, why would I want it in free mode?!" They didn't do enough research. That's why I gave them a (5/10)Rental... It's still a good game, yet so is the original game.
