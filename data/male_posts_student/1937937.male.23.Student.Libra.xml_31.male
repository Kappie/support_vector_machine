A summary of what happens whenever valid data is passed through an organization (or person) that deliberately or accidentally disregards or ignores its significance. Consider, for example, what an advertising campaign can do with a product's actual specifications."  urlLink  [TheFreeDictionary.Com]    urlLink James 'Kibo' Parry  is not a genius and he's not insane.  He's funny, though.  Take, for example, his gallery of images, which includes many pictures of cones and yellow "wet floor" signs (the image here was blatantly lifted off  urlLink his website ).  Kibo is delightfully amusing at times, but isn't as sharp-edged as I would like: for example, his brief aside "Yay! Two SAT words in one sentence" is cute, but the joy in humor is knowing that the author meant to do it, but he didn't point it out to you.  The less words, the better: this is an axiom of writing.  I hated creative writing: they were always telling me that, and giving me pictures to write stories about or saying "write a poem starting with the word  meatloaf ..."  It's detestable!  One can not  teach  the art of writing: I'd like you to find me one  really  good author who wrote something splendid, and see how many creative writing courses  he  took.  The forgoing paragraph is an exercise in using too much  emphasis .  Physics was interesting, in that we didn't cover anything I didn't already know.  But that's to be expected: I'm a nerd, and it was just the first day.  I was excited to see that the Lorentz transformation was among the material that is taught in this textbook.  That transformation is what got me interested in physics in the first place!  [Math Geeks, please stop reading now]: I notice that the  urlLink Lorentz transformation  looks a lot like arc length in two dimensions (i.e. sqrt(1 - (dx/dy)^2).  When one thinks about relativity, one is forced to grapple with the obscene fact that the speed of light is a constant.  Of course, this immediately leads to the question: what is speed?  I guess the way that I see it is that light is not actually "moving" -- this is actually kind of obvious, because from the perspective of a photon, there is no distance between points -- so when we observe movement, perhaps we aren't really getting the big picture.  I wonder if there's anyone out there who is with me on this... I know if I were a physics professor, and I were to read this, I would think: "that's nice kid, get a clue".  Good thing I'm not a physics professor, eh?  Good thing nobody is a physics professor... except for the physics professors.
