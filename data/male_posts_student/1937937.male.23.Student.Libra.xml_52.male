That's me -- when I've got shit that's very important to do, well... if you don't know all about it, then get off the computer and go invent something!  Green's theorem basically states that the contour integral i[P dx + Q dy] over the region C = ii[dq/dx - dp/dy] over some domain.  He might have an extra E at the end of his name.  We'll never know.  What else -- oh, I made a website and then I trashed it and then I made another one.  The initial website came to a grinding halt when I tried to put a submission form on one of the pages.  My server and I didn't get along, and we couldn't work things out, so I decided to compromise and not confuse myself further.  The Newt's name is Minute (pronounced my noot).  Let me show you a picture:      That's Carissa's hand.  We don't think it's going to live much longer: it certainly doesn't seem to be very excited about life.  We feed it live crickets.  It all feels very white trashy.  Perhaps I'm just returning to my roots...  Well, it's time to take a shower.  This is what I look like after I shower:      (Just kidding... that's not even my tongue!)
