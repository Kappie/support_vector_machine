I don't know how many of you outside of Orange County are following this  urlLink rape trial . Basically 3 teenagers filmed themselves having sex with a possibly unconscious girl. One of the teenagers is the son of the assistant Orange County sheriff. When I read about what the defense is saying, it comes across as really sexist. They are essentially saying don't listen to the slut. I know attacking the credibilty of the accuser is a part of trials, but are statements about her wanting to be a porn star, being promiscuous, etc. really relavent? The real issue is if it was consensual.  Speaking of other OC stuff... some officials want to  urlLink rename  John Wayne airport to The O.C. Airport after the TV show. That's so lame. Alex: what would they do with the Wayne statue? maybe they'll put a Mischa barton statue next to him? Hmm... looks like they're making me work some morning shifts next week. That means getting up at 5 AM!   Adolescents Saturday! Gotta make b-day plans too. Already got an e-greeting from Linda.  ***
