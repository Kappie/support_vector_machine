Of the 10 richest people in the world, 5 are Waltons 3. Wal-mart is the country's largest private employer with over one million employees (three times more than General Motors)  You would think it would be a nice place to work wouldn't you?  Ponder the following...  1. The average employee makes only $15000 a year for full-time work.  Most are even denied this measly income because they're limited to part-time only work. 2. The company brags that 70% of its workers are full-time, at Wal-Mart "full-time" is only 28 hours a week.  This means that "associates" gross less than $11000 a year. 3. Only 38% of Wal-Mart workers can afford coverage under the company's health plan. 4. Wal-Mart is rabidly anti-union.  When workers at a meet packing plant signed union cards at a Wal-Mart supercenter in Jacksonville Texas, Wal-Mart announced that it would be  closing the meat-cutting departments in  all  of its stores.    It gets worse...  Wal-Mart repeatedly breaks workers' compensation laws, child-labor laws (It has 1400 violations in Maine alone!), and surveillance of employee laws.    The turnover rate in stores is above 50 percent a year.  Many stores replace 100 percent of their employees each year.    Wal-Mart's purchasing headquarters is in China.  It is the largest importer of Chinese-made products in the world, buying $10 billion worth of merchandise a year.    Charlie Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee reports, "In country after country, factories that produce for Wal-Mart are the worst."  He adds that Wal-Mart is actually "lowering standards in China, slashing wages and benefits, imposing long mandatory-overtime shifts, while tolerating the arbitrary firing of workers who even dare to discuss factory conditions."  The people who make the products that Wal-Mart sells typically live in 7x7 shacks, work for 13 cents per hour, 7 days a week, with 20 hours shifts, in 100 degree temperatures.  Consider this the next time you hear "Always low prices, Always Wal-Mart."
