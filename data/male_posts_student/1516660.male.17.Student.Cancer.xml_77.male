Love makes the world go round. Love is the driving force in most of the things we do. We love love. We depend on love. Many want to love. Singles envy those in love. Loving couples love each other, and will do boundless thngs just for their loved ones. Such is the power of love.    However, love is also painful. Whenever one feels depressed, the other party will feel the same. Jealousy is a sign of love, even though it is depressing and ugly. Whenever complications arise between both parties, both will feel terribly upset, depressed, painful. Both will begin to wonder what wrong lies in them. Both begin to wonder if they should end their relationship. But in their hearts, they really don't want to. Sometimes, a couple breaks up, because one thinks it is best for the other. This is the power of love. A painful form of love. They still love each other.  Still loving.    Whatever the situation, we can infer: Both   LOVE   each other deeply. They really do.
