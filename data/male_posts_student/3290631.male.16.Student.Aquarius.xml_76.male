It was a party celebrating both her birthday and her best friend's 16th birthday since their birthdays take place right around the same time.  I really didn't feel like going--not because I'm one of these kids who hates their family but just because it didn't sound like it was going to be a lot of fun.  I'll give all my adoring female fans out there a visual of my attire. (yeah, like I've ever had adoring female fans) I wore a blue button down shirt with a navy blue tie with some sort of pattern and stripy thing on it, black dressy slacks, and my shiny black shoes----OK pretty bland but whatever, use your damn imagination.  So we arrived at the location and the DJ was there blasting some Spanish rap, the hostesses were setting the tables and the bar, and relatives were trickling in.  My other cousin, Rigo, the younger brother of my cousin, Krystal, whose party we were at, seemed bored and lonely.  He's going to be nine years old in less than a month.  I decided to give him some company.  Rigo really looks up to me and I remember when I was younger and my older brother, Victor, reached the age group that I'm currently in and he abandoned me for his friends.  That's not a cool feeling, so I try to be a good role model for Rigo.  Once everyone had arrived, the bar was open, the music was blasting, and I was still hanging out with Rigo.  My mom let me finish one of her drinks, and I asked her to order me others.  Soon enough, I had had four of whatever she was having, two orders of rum and coke that my oldest brother, Manny, had slipped me, and a margaritah.  Needless to say, I was fairly drunk.  I'm surprised that I managed to text message with Kyle all night long.  Then my mother started to beg me to dance with her.  That must have been quite a sight.  I was literally on the verge of falling over while dancing with her.  I got better at containing my dizzyness as the night went on though, and I managed to dance with my aunt, my mother, my cousin, and my lesbian second cousin or some other thing.  I get confused with family ties and stuff.  I've rambled quite a bit here.  Long story short, I had a great time because I was able to get drunk and relax instead of dwelling on how different I am from my family.  Today, I met Becky and Kyle and we chilled for a little bit before and after seeing Surefire live at Rothko.  I like hanging out with you two, you're very fun people and it's very nice seeing you guys.  We sat in the park before they caught their train and we had some good laughs.  The little kids were cute and I kind of wanted to play with them--next time.  I had a good day today.  Babay-K's birthday is in a few days and maybe I'll head up there or meet her or her and Becky--I dunno yet.    In other news, I was invited to a sweet 16 of a girl from school.  Frankly, I don't really want to go for several reasons--two of them being that it's in Brooklyn and that I don't know if I have to bring a gift and if I do, I don't feel like buying this particular girl one.  So I think I'm gonna R.S.V.P. and say that my family and I will be in Philadelphia that weekend and I won't be able to attend.  I'll do that just as soon as I get the nerve.  That's about it.  This blog was too long..oh well.
