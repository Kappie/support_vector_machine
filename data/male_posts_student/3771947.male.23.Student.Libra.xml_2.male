" Dating " -  getting to know someone, no sex, you cannot cheat or "shmeggle."    2. " Seeing " -  you know the person, sexcan beinvolved, shmeggling applies and cheating at the higher levels of shmeggling.    3. " boy/girl friend " -  a commitment is made to one another, definately sex,cheating applies and any shmeggles become cheats.    So what is "shmeggling?" - a made up word to describe acts frowned upon, butdo not warrant totally breaking things off in a "seeing" relationship. A shmeggle might be talking to an ex, kissing, calling new numbers aquired or returning their phone calls, heavy petting, etc...   Cheating would warrant ending the relationship and includes; sex, oral, and hand jobs etc... Note: Any shmeggling becomes cheating once boy/girl friend status has been made clear.   A SHMEGGLER COULD EASILY BECOME A CHEATER!  -Danielle has 5 schmeggles to Eric's 4
