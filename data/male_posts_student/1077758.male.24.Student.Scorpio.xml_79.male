Basically kids showing up and clocking in, talking with a little work mixed in for around 5-6 hours, then getting sent home.    And on an even sadder note, Mike died.    I know, nobody knows who Mike is.  I'm sure they're wondering why they should even care about Mike. Well, if you've ever wondered why martyrs do what martyrs are usually known for, it should make an interesting story. Mike was a bagger at the store.  He was at least 70 years old.   I  come home tired after a day of work, I can only imagine what he felt like.  A couple of years ago, his body basically gave out on him a day at work.  I'm not sure, but I think it was a heart attack, or something similar.  I wasn't there, but I knew the ambulance had to come pick him up.  Mike took off close to a year, maybe more, trying to rest up so he could come back.  Why, after having a serious health problem would he possibly want to come back to a physically demanding job?  He wanted to earn the money to pay for his wife's cancer treatments, because the disease was slowly eating away at her.  Eventually Mike came back to work, but nothing was the same.  He would work 3, maybe 4 hours a day, and he was obviously slowed down compared to even his old level of work.  Unfortunately, he knew this, and pretty much quit one day after realizing he couldn't do it.  And now, as far as I know, he's preceded his wife in death.  I'm not saying what he did was the right thing, or even if there is a right and wrong side to this story.    But it   did   happen.
