And when you bite into ice cream with your two front teeth, every single person of the six billion on the entire planet will laugh at the expression on your face all at once and the noise will be so loud the vibrations will start earthquakes and destroy all of the major cities, and all of the minor cities, and pretty much anything really, and all the tall buildings on the planet will fall and since there are more tall buildings in New York City than anywhere else, when they all fall, the entire planet will be thrown out of orbit in the opposite direction of New York City and we'll be floating in space until either we: a) freeze or b) fly into a star or another planet  And  that  won't be very refreshing.  Stop eating ice.
