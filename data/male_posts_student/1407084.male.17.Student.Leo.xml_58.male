(We were watching a movie, and to top it all off I have already seen it.. grrr)  I left early, but I think only 1 person noticed that I was leaving, so oh well. I say "Bah" to all those people who don't care, and I thank the one person there who seemed to care that I was leaving, they know who they are, and you are probably not them.  I really want to go for a long drive through the country.. just watch the plains roll past my windows, not a care in the world. But, that's probably not going to happen. So I'll just imagine I'm driving though the countryside and that my car has cruise control for a few minutes.
