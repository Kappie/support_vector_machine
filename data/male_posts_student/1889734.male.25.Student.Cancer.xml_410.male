This is my response to Mark's question about how I would imagine a slave-less society.  Of course, the lost post was MUCH better than this one.  My idea of a free society requires the acknowledgement of responsibility that comes with freedom.  We must all be adult and accept the things that we must do for ourselves, and should we ignore the responsibility, we should be allowed to suffer the consequences of those actions.  Democracy.  I don’t believe in it.  I don’t think democracy in the way we are now practicing it is a good thing.  I think I’ve said it before – democracy leads to mob rule, where the will of the minority is plowed under by the momentary passions of the mob.    I believe in a nation of laws.  These laws should be minimal and damned difficult to change.  I would start with the Bill of Rights and stop there.  Very few laws are needed outside of that document.    I believe in representative government within the boundaries of the established laws.  I select someone whose job is to make sure no one messes around with the laws.  In the rare cases when a law needs to be changed, that representative is trusted to operate in the spirit of the Constitution.  That representative has a duty to ignore the majority if the majority is wrong, which is most of the time.  The will of the mob does not make something right if it is outside of the bounds of our law.  I guess I’m a hardcore Strict Constructionalist.  I believe that the Tenth Amendment invalidated 99.999% of all government activity in our lives.  None of it is legal in the strictest sense.  But as a society, we have abandoned the notion that our freedom carries responsibility.  We signed it all over to someone else, and began reaching into the ‘rich’ man’s pockets to pay for that which is our responsibility.   As for the idea of chaos and anarchy, I point you to the chaos of the marketplace.  From nothing but the free and voluntary choices made by people, we have a deca-trillion dollar economy churning away in mass chaos, but somehow providing goods and products, matching up buyers and sellers, and providing for the needs of all of us.  There is no central authority behind the market.  And there is no compulsion at work in the market.  Everyone is free to make their own choices.  I seek the same thing in the sector of life we have labeled as ‘public’.  Instead of shoveling all of our tax money into one big pit to be allocated at the whim of others, why can we not choose how to spend our money ourselves?  Why are we not trusted to be free with our choices?  Why can’t FedEx compete with the USPS when it comes to mail delivery?  Why can’t private companies compete to provide primary and secondary education, offering service for price and seeking to attract consumers?    How about an example.  Why can’t I pay a user fee for the roads based upon my odometer reading?  I utilized a certain amount of wear based upon my vehicle weight and miles driven.  I expect to pay for this service.    Why must I pay a property tax to fund a school when I am not utilizing that school?  I expect to pay directly for my child’s education.  I am responsible for it, so I should pay for it.  And my choice of schools should include schools ran for profit, competing to provide the best education and the best price.  I should have choices.  As for other public services, I DO believe in voluntary funding.  Like I said, part of being free is accepting the consequences of action.  As a sensible person, I would purchase Fire and Police protection to cover my family and property.  That is sensible.  I would expect the same of everyone else.  I would also be interested in voluntarily providing extra money that would help anyone in my area that may need some assistance in seeking similar coverage.  But if my neighbor refuses to purchase coverage despite being able to afford it, then he must suffer the consequences.  I would even like to see competition in fire prevention and police services.  If someone thinks they can provide a more efficient, better and safer police force, then let him have at it and try to get customers.  After all, the law is written down – we all are able to see what it says.    I want all ‘public’ services privatized and made voluntary.  I also want those that choose to ignore basic needs to suffer the consequences of their neglect.  It is part of being free.    I believe in the enlightened self-interest.  That is different than the animalistic self-gratification of those that ignore law and do what they please.  They are distinct.  I expect those that live to the law to prosper.  Those that refuse to accept their responsibilities should not be coddled and allowed to drain resources.  If you want to cover a person who refuses to pay for fire protection, what about health insurance, auto insurance, and so on?  If we accept that some people are too stupid or irresponsible to take care of the basic ‘public’ utility needs like educating their children, or providing for their own retirement, what else are you willing to pay for on their behalf?
