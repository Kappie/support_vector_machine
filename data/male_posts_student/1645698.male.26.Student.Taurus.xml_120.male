They were suppose to go upstate to do something...then at 1o something my mom calls home and tells me to change and go with them.  Meanwhile I'm thinking, didn't you already go???  Apparently not!  There was no way I was going, and she tried to get my dad into it, like, "your dad wants you to go, so get changed!"  Then sometime later, she came home and was trying to get me to go.  Of course I stood my ground and stayed sitting in front of the TV.  So she left mumbling something under her breath.  Then my dad called telling me to go.  What is wrong with them?  So I made up some excuse about having to study and stuff.  (Which I really do, but not really.)    And I was still thinking, "didn't you guys already go??"    So tell me, my friends, what is the secret to weird parents?
