One's got parental problems and is falling from God, another one's got parental problems and has got her home phone line cut due to outstanding bills, another one's got her aunt in hospital and a very ill mom at home. Man!  Damn! I can't believe I've *swear word*ing been spelling intellectual wrong this whole *swear word*ing time.   What have I got? A broken home, A broken heart, A broken dream. HurraH! Despite the many daunting problems my peers may be facing, I refuse and I say firmly REFUSE to believe that I have been self-centered. Contrary to what some may adamantly choose to believe. I don't have anyone close to me dying yet, but I am. Dying to realize my dream, to go places, to do things with my life. Things that I want to do. Perhaps then, it won't be a dream. On the other hand, the realization of it may prove so blissful, it would be justified, only to call it a dream. All this, though the odds seem insurmountable.  I envy Desiree. You reading this darling? She is young, but her mind is beautiful. I am at a loss for words. Am I a sucker for ladies with interesting and different minds? Why can't I find intellectuals in most places I go? Desiree writes. I want to be able to do that too. Different style you say? Screw you. I want to be able to do that.
