Well, Tim Johnson (D-South Dakota(GO SD!))discriminated republicans and saying that they were "terrorists"!!!!! He "tried" to apologize today, but to me, he failed. You know why? He said, "I'm sorry if I offended anyone." ... Is that it? Were you waiting for an apology on making the comment? Well he didn't. Which makes him "mean hearted" don't you think? That's what I think, thank you.
