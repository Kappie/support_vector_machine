In other news, I have decided on a new layout and like I promised, those music, mood and site things have gone, but fear not, thanks to  urlLink iMood  we have a lovely little smilie thing on the side menu so now you know my mood and get a lovely smilie as well - what more could you ask for?  Anyway, its a lovely day today so I think I might go outside and enjoy it, Ciao!
