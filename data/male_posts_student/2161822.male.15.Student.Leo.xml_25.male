Now I don't mind labs. They're usually fun considering it's two less periods I have to listen to our teacher lecture. But this lab was excrutiatingly (I know I killed the spelling on that) annoying. Each experiment took at at least a half hour and it would be fine if we had that much time. But of course we don't.  It wasn't really the lab itself I was mad over. More the fact that I was at home the rest of the night typing up a lab report about crap he didn't teach. I was trying to figure out formulas and equations for over 5 hours plus typing and retyping things after I realize they are all wrong. It also might have helped if we actually did the experiment right, but oh well. Anway, today in chemistry, he finally taught the crap that I needed to do the lab. Of course after I spent hours trying to figure it out myself. If you can't tell, I dislike chemistry. Alot. Anyway, our new Algebra teacher is awesome. Much better than our crackhead teacher, although I will never forget some of the things she has said. Enough said for today. Listen to H.I.M.
