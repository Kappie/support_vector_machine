I have so many reasons to live and so many ways to enjoy life but at the same time there are so many ways to be hurt. You know what I'm talking about. Those times when the whole world seems to be out for your blood. When no matter how sunny it is there's always this dark cloud hanging over you. That's me right now. That's what I feel like. Everything I enjoy about my life is overshadowed by overwhelming shadow and pain. It's not like I can't remember the good things that have already happened. It's just that everything now, even good things, don't seem quite as good.    I guess it can sorta come from this whole past year. Since I started high school, things have been different. I got a whole different group of friends. People I really care about. Heck, we're probably the closest thing our school has to goths. Heh, thing is we're also the nerds. Not so bad really. I mean, I know my parents don't really approve of most of them. They're pretty much all at least a year older than me, with the exception of Mitch and Bussboy. And I think that's part of the problem. I know half of them I probably won't see to much of for the next long while. They'll be off to university and college while I'm stuck back here. I really don't know what I'll do without some of them. Gram, the Bluefish, Cam, Big Steve, Dev, Laim and even Cher and Tasha. They support me. They're there for me. Take Big Steve for instance. My parents really dislike him. They may even be justified. He drinks and sometimes has anger problems. But I mean, the thing is, I can pretty much be sure he'd be the first one there if someone was trying to kick my ass. I'm not the toughest guy around and I'm slightly a pacifist and, well, we don't call him Big Steve for nothing.  My point is, these guys (And girls) aren't exactly perfect people. But, you know, they're still my friends. And that means that all that shit doesn't matter. You are who you are. and that's all right by me.    But on to my next problem. Steph. I've had a major assed crush on her for at least two or three years now. We've been pretty good friends all the while. Now, we went out together for awhile and then broke up.  A few months later it was all fine again and we were still friends. Then she asks me for a second chance.  Now, you have to understand how this is working. I am still in love here. However, since she just wanted to be friends, well, that's all it would ever be. So of course I leap at a second chance. It seems to be going fine and as you might tell from a previous post or two it was indeed. Right up until she dumps me a second time. That was like almost two weeks now I think. I am still fucking shattered mentally. That's part of the reason I feel like I do.    And so it goes on. I also slacked off majorly this past year. This is not a good thing. My marks went from all high ninties to maybe mid eighties and a couple of seventies. For me, those are horrible marks. I just put no effort into things. I had no motivation. I think my only really high mark was in history. It was one of the few subjects I was interested in. This is probably one of the worst things to happen to me. I can only guess why. Both my brother and sister are like, friggin geniuses. They both got full scholarships and so on. My brothers already got a job programming that will probably get him more per hour than I ever will. My sisters simply got it pretty good. I'm not saying they don't have problems. We all do and I'm sure they have theirs. I'm saying I can't really ever hope to match up. I might be able to get good marks and so on but I'll never be  as  good. So I sorta accept that and slack off. It's not a good thing and it doesn't help me here. I mean I've always procrastinated but I've always seen that as a good thing. I work well under pressure. This is worse and scares me more than just about anything.    I guess what I'm trying to say is that this has both been the worst and best year of my life. MY lifes changed, for better or for worse I couldn't tell you. But I'm me. And I can live with that.    Forever and Always,   -Dant
