We stopped for dinner in Pennsylvania at a place that was a mixture of retaurants (with obnoxiously expensive prices for food - lol).  When we got to Ohio, we joined in with the singing and the Holy Hour.  The music was awesome!  Bob Rice and his band, the Backyard Galaxy, were great.  Music is always a big part of these retreats. I was singing, dancing, and lifting up my hands.  After the beautiful Holy Hour we returned to the dorms for sleep, excited about the next day.  Stay tuned as I will continue to write more on my experiences with God during this weekend in Heaven.
