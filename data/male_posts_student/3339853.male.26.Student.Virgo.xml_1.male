First, I will tell you about what is street food. But here I will not pay attention to Fast food since it is well known to everyone and I do not think it is necessary for me to bring it up here.  And Next is street food in the Philippines based on which I choosed from the internet.  And importantly, Balut.   Then I will move on to cultural factors that explain why street food in the Philippines is so popular there.  And I prepared all four reasons here.   Okay, Let me begin here.  What is street food ?. Street food is the food that is sold and eaten on the street as you read the paper I handed.  And especially in the Philippines, It plays one of the important roles in the life and culture of the Philippines and We certainly realize how important it means to the Filipinos.    I can make it much easier to understand by taking the case here in Korea. When you walk along the street in downtown Seoul, You never miss those street vendors right on each side of the street. You can see they sell all kinds of things from electric gadgets to food we rarely cook at home. Those food smell good and spicy , looking red or not surely attract us.   And let me take a look at street food in the philippines. ~~~~~~~   Balut is a A specialty of the Philippines - "a fertilized duck's egg, boiled and eaten by cracking the wide end, making a hole, sipping the broth, and then cracking the whole open to savor the red yolk and the tiny chick inside. The perfect balut, to the Filipino, is 17 days old, at which stage the chick is still wrapped in white and does not show beak or feathers   And cultural factors that make it so special are four reasons picked up from the book.  You may better understand what all those four facts are all about if you read the textbook.  well, I will sum up those ideas.   First reason for what is taking place in the case of popularity of street food in the Philippines is about the Filipino meal. They have three meals a day and these give them considerable time and space to enjoy eating inside and outside. And Meals at home extend to yard or street( too many guests or not enough rooms ), which is never unusual or strange. So does the restaurant and the public.   Second is about a concept of meals as stopping points. I think it has more to do with pastime during which we bite some snacks. In the philippines, there is small meal called " pangtawid gutom " between major meals  and People snack   Third one is the Filipino idea of community. Rice is the staple food in the Philippines and they all work hard to maintain their life. For this, Community means a lot.  They need to plant and plough together to make the best use of their efforts to get more products when it is ripe.  And This togetherness links each other strongly and by which they naturally find a place to sit and chat sharing food, idea and many others. This place enables people to eat outside without any hesitation.   The last reason, Food sellers' extention.   Food seller's role changed and they bring food to where it is in need. This means that people can have food easily. And street food began in the same manner.
