I could feel my lips! and I can tast again! Hit the coffee and chocolate hardcore. I'll be able to sing at the battle of the bands no problemo on friday, I'll tell you more about that later.      I fixed that damn  Darkness  album, very cool band, finnally someone  else  who uses falsetto for musical purposes! I started cleaning my room today, I have floor!      Got heaps of homework to do, I kinda missed today, sleeping, *Ding Dong*? must be the pizza, don't worry one of my slaves.... err i mean brothers wil answer the door. I think we got cheese, beef and onion and some other thing. Yum. At least I can taste it now! Hooray for Olfaction! I probably got that wrong and Claire's gonna yell at me, (being the science queen that she is). So yeah, I have    Art, Literature, and english homework from three months ago which I really have to do. A clean room may provide worthy incentive.       Well, i'm off for pizza, and I'll blog ya'z lat0rz!
