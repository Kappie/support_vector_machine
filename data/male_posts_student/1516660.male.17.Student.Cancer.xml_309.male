That Joyce suddenly cancelled, saying that she's the only girl. CQ cancelled after that, and WQ has no mood to go bowling. I was so mad...my happiness was being deprived. MEOW!   Sigh! I then watched my Cardcaptor Sakura movie, the Chingay Parade and my taped Sat's shows. Meow. After that, I went online lor. Play games, surfed the Net. At 5, I took a short afternoon nap. When I woke up, I felt really weak and hot. When I took my temperautre, my body temperature measured 37.9 degrees. Oh my meow....I am wearing a jacket now because when I am feverish, I feel very cold when coming into contact with fans. Meow.   Hmm... I am very troubled. I put on more weight! OH MY GOD! I LOOK SO FAT! I visited a website on fet reducing. Horrors of horrors! I gotta eat right, do regular aerobic exercises... Oh my god....I want to go for liposuction! MEOW!!  Okay, I think I end le... Nothing to write le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
