July was a pretty good month expect for the fact that school is approaching us every so quickly.  We get to go get our schedules the 11th of August so school is getting close to starting again.  I haven't been shopping yet so I'm a little behind.  But all well still got some time to do all my shopping to look stylin' for the year.  Anyways, thought of an idea the other day where viewers, such as yourself, would send me e-mails if you had a question of opinion and I would answer them and call it "Viewer mail" or something so if you've got a question send it over to  urlLink HaroldWM2002@yahoo.com  anyways to the events!    Current Events (stolen from da bunny)  Where: "New York, New York"  Time: 2 mins past 3  What's new?: School is about to start aww :'/  Song of the month: Going old school on you, going with "Come fly with me" by Jamie Cullum. Old school song but new school singer.  Music on?
