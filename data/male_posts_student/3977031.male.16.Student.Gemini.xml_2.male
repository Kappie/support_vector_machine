This Blog would also like to take this opportunity to state that it does not affiliate itself with any political party or organized religion or discourage others from said affiliation, but it does encourage you to take a look at every topic from all angles and put some serious thought into your opinion while you are forming it. I also urge everyone to take a look at many options when choosing the religion, political party, or group that is right for you. With the introduction out of the way lets dive right in to our discussion.     The Blog is firmly for gay marriage, and really does not see a strong argument against it. The only thing other than prejudice that the people opposed to gay marriage have been basing their argument on is a 1800 year old book of contradictions more commonly known to everyone as the Bible.     Now it is time to knock the spindly little legs out from underneath the anti-gay marriage argument. We do not even need to try to take prejudice down because we have been working to rid our country of prejudice since it was founded. The prejudices against homosexuals is just the next bump in the road toward a prejudice-free America. Then we get into the biggest argument against allowing homosexuals to marry.     The argument that it is morally wrong and against the Christian Bible is also not an argument that can not stand up against our constitution. In fact that argument goes against one of the basic liberties we have as Americans, freedom of religion. This argument would in effect force Christian morals upon everyone in our nation.     This brings me to what bothers me the most about the constitutional amendment. It adds contradictions to the Constitution. Not allowing homosexuals to marry brings discrimination into a document, which serves to prevent discrimination.     Now let us discuss some of the solutions proposed and their problems. The first solution was to grant same-sex couples civil unions, which would allow them some of the rights of married couples. This solution still shows discrimination in the way that it does not grant equal rights. Even if it did it would not be an acceptable solution because it would still show prejudice.     The last subject I would like to touch on, that I plan on taking a more in-depth look at in a later post, is whether gay marriage would do anything to destroy the institution of marriage. The answer is  absolutely not . Correct me if I'm wrong, but I have always believed that the whole idea behind marriage was love. Why should it make any difference who makes up the couple that is being married as long as they truly love each other. We all must remember that love is blind, and no one can choose who they fall in love with and truly call it love. Love just happens, and we as humans have no control over love. I believe that sexual orientation is just as uncontrollable as the weather.     In conclusion, I would just like to say that love is love, and that is all that marriage should be based on.
