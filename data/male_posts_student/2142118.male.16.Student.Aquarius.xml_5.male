Well, if you really think about it, we all need apriest... we are all dirty and sinful, needing a priest to intercede on our behalf where God is so holy we can't go.  Christ is our ultimate, high priest... He made a sacrifice on our behalf - the sacrifice of Himself.  He intercedes on our behalf.  We just have the best and only covenant.  We are now washed clean, and therefore, able to meet God.  Read Hebrews... good book.
