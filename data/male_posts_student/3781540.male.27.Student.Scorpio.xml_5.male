Or is he? I mean is hard mincing round in your pyjamas with people who can't even punch? Or being an army receptionist? I think he answered the phone or something.  The one redeeming feature of the man named after a bunny home is that, in the good old tradition of british squaddies, he fucking hates everybody. Well at least everybody who he has ever met! After a failed attempt to be employed by Goldbergs Sack he is now turning his career toward the comedy route as offers flood in for him to front Whiteadder the new british tv show. He is currently in acting school learning to be a sarcy ex-soldier with a vicious social streak! (shouldn't take long). For a man so vehemently english, Hutch refuses to watch harry potter and while the nation came to a standstill to watch us lose on penalties again, he calmly read his paper in the middle of a crowded pub wondering what all the fuss was about.  However, he is a massive fan of Wayne Bridge, and fawned like a schoolgirl when he met his childhood hero face to face.  Stew   urlLink
