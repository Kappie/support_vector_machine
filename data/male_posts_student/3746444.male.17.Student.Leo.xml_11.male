I'm just saying that there is plenty more fish in the sea you might find an even bigger fish, you just have to have a little more patience. I just think its funny how you still want to go back out with him even after you said you will never go out with him again. Because I know for a fact that you would of kicked my ass for even thinking about going back out with Gaby. Sorry if I seem to be coming off as rude I just had to get this off my chest. And I could see if your pissed off at me but hopefully we are good enough friends to see that I'm not trying to be a dick I'm just saying you might want to give dating another chance.
