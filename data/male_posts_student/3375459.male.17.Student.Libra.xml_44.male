But a winamp player is require on your computer, without further ado, here's the  urlLink site .   Tonight, somebody reminded me that I'm a little pervert, a pretty irritating one. How should I react? I guess, I've got to accept and change. As much as I don't like to go back to the quiet me, still I got to or I will have friends leaving me I guess.   WAHahhaa! Tara looked me up for another game of Hexic, such determination. I’m feeling kind of bad to have left half way into her game for a shower, leaving her with no competitor and definitely no mood to play. I'm sorry girl.  I've bought tickets (actually only 2) to catch "The Day After Tomorrow" with my Mum. I bet she have forgotten the last time she went of a movie, shame on my dad. HEhheee... She's a pretty hardworking Mum lah, taking care of us 24hours non stop. Since I got paid from Tara's job, I thought of treating her to this movie. My sister's are joining us too, but they are going to pay for themselves =p. Hopefully my Mum understands what's going on in the movie, you know the Chinese subtitles for thrillers really flashes by fast, hope she can catch them. I’ve just checked the seats again online. Apart form us four, only five other seats have been taken up. The privilege of going for an early morning movie is that you'll get whole cinema to yourself. =) LalalAlal~
