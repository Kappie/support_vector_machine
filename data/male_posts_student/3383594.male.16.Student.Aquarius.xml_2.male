Fortunately, the last hour would be the cleaning up of our classrooms, so I was saved from chinese. Haha.  Before recess was so boring, I wasn't even paying attention to anything the teacher was saying. When he made us do our own work, I did some, before falling to sleep. Haha, I was tired alrite! The American Idol Finale Results was like up to 12am! But it was worth it to stay up late and watch it. It was juz incredible! Those tt actually missed the show, missed out on 1 of the most extraordinary television programme ever! It was juz amazing, no words left to describe. Haha.  After recess was another teacher who allowed us to revise on our own. But as u all noe, I would probably be slacking and yea I was. The fat pussy cat arrested me and escorted me to the back of the class. L0L! He thinks tt he's my guard! Hmmph! No1 arrests Shawn The Great or treats Shawn The Great like a prisoner! Cus I'm not a Prisoner of War! Grrr! He stole my mobile phone and started to send MMS without my permission! L0L! When I tried stopping him, he used his claws to attack me. Wow, now tt was fierce!  Cleaning the classroom was a joy as compared to having chinese lessons. Haha, time seems to fly real quick and b4 I knew it, it was time to go home! Weee!!!  I had lunch at the hawker centre wif the usual ppl. It was hard to find a place as it was lunch time. The fat pussy cat didn't eat anything, he's probably on a diet or something. L0L! (He's gonna kill me for this, but I'll still say the word: PEACE!)  After lunch, the fat pussy cat forced me to take a cab. Well, I had no other choice! In the cab he made me promise to send some MMS to his email. Again, I had no choice. Well, let's juz put it this way, I do haf a choice, but I'm juz being nice. Haha, I'm juz basically a nice person, so yea dun get misunderstand and think tt I'm afraid of him. Hell no! L0L!  ***Important Update On My Injury*** I'll be seeing the doc tomorrow, so wish me the best of luck and hope nothing bad happens. Alrite den, cya! =]
