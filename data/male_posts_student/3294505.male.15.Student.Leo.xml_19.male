    
       Ever just look up at the sky, and shut yourself off from the world?  You know, when it's a grey-skyed afternoon in spring or summer, and you can smell the rain coming. And if you can, you sit, and delve yourself as deep into your psyche as humanly possible? To unlock doors you hadnt opened in what felt like a millenia, and to go from instant self-induced highs from good times past, to rock bottom lament because of things you should'nt have thunk of. In a way, you talk to yourself, within the recesses of your mind, trying to make even the tiniest, most insignificant thing imaginable have a purpose, things you noticed on your walk to wherever it is you may sit to do such aforementioned thinking.   You replay the scenes you'd been thinking of over and over in your head, traumatically, as if trying to find a railing to hang on in your mentality as the floor falls from you because you think you're going insane. Overthinking. All the time. It's becoming your saving grace, and the knife that will eventually slay you. Maybe, if this person seems like it's you, you blink, having pulled yourself from that metaphysical trance, no longer weaving in and out of the souls you interacted with. The second you blink, almost cinematically, the grey clouds you may have been looking up at, let out a drop of rain on your face, before the weather patterns that seemed nothing more than annoyance in your extensively-busy-seeming life push the rest of the precipitation onto you.  Life telling you to get over yourself, there's plenty of time for another session like this again, and fate will decide when it'll be.  Things may or may not seem clearer to you, next time around. But at the moment, it doesnt seem like that's the point of things, as you might have reasoned lots of stuff over while staring seemingly emptily at the sky. Maybe if this is something you picture yourself easily doing, having such a retrospect with your own mentality, then maybe I am you....
