I've got an interview with PwC downtown, and they're putting me up in a sweet hotel, taking me out to dinner in Little Italy tomorrow night, then grilling me mercilessly at the office on Friday morning. But it'll be good to get out of Central Illinois.  Glad to see that Ulli is STILL talking about Love Actually. I mean, it's a good movie, but move on Ulli. Keira Knightley is wicked hot, though. Rare for a Brit ;)  Bought my girlfriend the soundtrack and she listens to it 24-7 now. Got an insanely long e-mail from Wieteke the other day, so apparently Holland is still afloat. No word from SARS-chaser, Vegard.
