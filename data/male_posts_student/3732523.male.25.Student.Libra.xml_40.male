At present, my work mainly entails showing grossly over-paid,incredibly neurotic people who have incredibly short attention spans how to accomplish ostensibly simple tasks on the computer. Unfortunately, these tasksbecome infinitely more difficult when no one listens to explanations, and no one does. So, after 8 hours at the office, my time comprised predominately of 20-minute segments in which I explain such computer subtleties as the difference between a "right click" and a "left click," I am usually quite ready to jump off a rather large bridge.   Sadly, I don't have the balls.   In other news, I saw a new musical tonight, music and lyrics by Steven Sondheim, starring (and written by) Nathan Lane. It's a very free adaptation of the Aristophanes Play, "The Frogs," in which Dionysos and his slave Xanthias go to the underworld to try and brimg back a playwright to save mankind. The original version of the play was laden with political satire and subtle humor, as wasLane's adaptation (for instance, the frogs who attack pre-emptively but then can't remember why they attacked in the first place). It was sort of funny, but mainly disjointed and all-together not worth the money. It was fun seeing Nathan Lane 10-feet from my face, I admit, but somehow it wasn't quite as epiphanic (is that a word?)a moment as I had envisioned.  You probably could'vedone something more productive with the minute it took you to read this post.  End.
