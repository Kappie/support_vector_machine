If the situation weren't so serious, the statement the captors have released would almost be humorous:    "We have warned all the countries, companies, businessmen and truck drivers that those who deal with American cowboy occupiers will be targeted by the fires of the Mujahedeen. Here you are once again transporting goods, weapons and military equipment that backs the U.S. Army.''  American cowboy occupiers? Well, it looks like Bill O'Reilly got his wish. We're back to the Wild West, but I don't know if this is quite what he expected -- unless Al Franken is one of those abducted.
