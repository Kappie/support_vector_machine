Campbell's Select canned soup is better than that Chunky soup.  I'll need to pay the grocery store another visit sometime this week.  Art History 550E: 8/10 (Dec. 15) Art History 572F: 8/17 (Dec. 10) Sociology 607: 11/18 (Dec. 16) Sociology 616: 2/20  (Dec. 11) Totals: 29 / 65 = 44.6%  Remaining: 36 pages / approx. 23 days = 1.5 per day  This week I plan on getting a significant chunk of 572F and 616 done.  ***
