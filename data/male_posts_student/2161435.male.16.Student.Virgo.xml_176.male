Isnt it terrible when you come out of an exam thinking "well that wasnt too bad" and everyone else is like "Omg, that was crap" and you're thinking... I must have got it all wrong. This is not a good thing. Still, I only have 20 mins of exams tomorrow. then i will do something else. God knows what... just hope my dad lets me go to ju jitsu in the evening. Good god, that was the most boring post i have ever written.
