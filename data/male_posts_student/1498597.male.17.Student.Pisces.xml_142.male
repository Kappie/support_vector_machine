Did I tell you about how  Nick and I  have a dual blog called the  Three Eye Witnesses ?  Well, we do, and I thought I should share the great news with you all!  Also,  Nick  has a new AIM!  It's  WritingDude87 , and I personally think that it was about time for a change!  Even if, the name  runningdude2000  was clearly out dated because:      (1)  If you check your household calendar, you will notice that it is the year 2003, not 2000.      (2)  Neither  Nick  or myself are involved in any sort of "running activity", which makes his old AIM very, very invalid!  Anyway, I'm outta words to say right now and can't blog anymore.  Plus I have to create a new blog for the  Three Eye Witnesses .  More to come...!
