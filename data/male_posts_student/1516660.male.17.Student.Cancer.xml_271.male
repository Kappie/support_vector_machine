They only want temp workers, and we have to go work in Marina. ...  I was like...jobless lor. I can either stay at home until release of O Level results or go to YJ to study. Yeah...I was contemplating these options lor.  Hmm... I ate bread for breakfast, while mother went to 883 to get a haircut and buy groceries. I did nothing except to surf the net and chat with WQ. For lunch, me and Mother went to 768 to eat Pig Organ Soup (with rice). Yeah...  In the afternoon also lazed around lor. Hmm... after giving it lotsa thoughts, I decided to go to YJ. Me lazing around the house and rotting away is not a viable option. I'll go mental! Actually hor, it was WQ who made me make this decision. He's doing his GP homework, and I realized so much that I craved for homework. Esepcially GP, Chem and Bio! I wanna do homework! (I know this is atypical for a student.... but I really miss school! I can really feel Manda's and Wendy's longing for school... Once a student, always a student!) Yeah, I am appealing tomorrow. Meow.....  Hmm...we ate dinner, watched TV, and tada. I am here. I think I end here liao la. Yet another of my short blogs. Oh well. Wish me luck tomorrow. Night blog!
