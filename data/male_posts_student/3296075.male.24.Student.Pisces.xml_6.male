As for what we do tommorow, I'm not gonna try to say, but if I don't post for a while, we're probably out on the high seas, or at our island. I do know we hope to make it down to Nassau and Atlantis on Paradise Island by July 4th. We did a couple hours of snorkeling today and I finally got to use my homemade Hiwaiian sling, which is spear you shoot like a slingshot, and after about a million misses I got one.  The best part was it wasn't the fish I was aiming at. Check him out, he's a  urlLink whopper .
