The movie was okay, but who am I to judge...im not Ebert or Roper or whoever they are. As I was taking Jadie home just about 10 minutes ago, some frickin moron just about ran into us. Some lady was turning right, off the highway, and into the  urlLink Hy-Vee  parking lot. But she was stupid and wasn't paying attention and about hit me while I was waiting to turn out of the parking lot! I bit my tongue so as to not unleash my fury of big words and swearing onto her and just let it go. No biggie right?
