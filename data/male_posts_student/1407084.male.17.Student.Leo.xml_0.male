I know there are a few girls who would like a date, and I feel bad because I am not planning on asking them, but I think I am too depressed to go to the dance. Oh well.  I am probably going to go to the party after the Homecoming dance.   Besides that, it seems that our band's field show is going to be the most horrid abomination I have ever taken part in. Yay for Jarvis, yay for not rehearsing things and forgetting them, yay for making us not porform the good looking part of the show and forcing us to play the uncoordinated mess that is "Birdland" on the field.  Maybe It wil rain Friday night. Everyone pray.
