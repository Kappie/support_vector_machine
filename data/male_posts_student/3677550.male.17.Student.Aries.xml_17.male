"one fault, one thing realised"... sounds appropriate now to me... i noticed that a long time ago, but still can hardly express myself that well... i am so ashamed of myself for being what and who i am... and i am still thinking of a word worse than "ashamed", coz it might mean more to me... there's still this thing... which is still blocking the passage of openness... still unrevealed... no one will understand it i guess... the simple reason being it is i dun understand myself either... when i dun, who ever will? few years back i thought this problem will sooner or later be resolved... who knows... after 5 to 6 years... it is still out there somewhere, hidden, and unnoticed... maybe i need some therapy to clear the doubt out? whatever....
