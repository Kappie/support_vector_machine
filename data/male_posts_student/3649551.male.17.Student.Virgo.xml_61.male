I like the brutal honesty of that Pedro the Lion song.   urlLink http://randomyousay.blogspot.com/    Some days I don't love you at all.  I'm too busy loving myself.  I too would like to spend some time honestly reflecting on my unrest. I often feel like I can't really begin living until I get out of college. I convince myself that I'm trapped in a kind of limbo because school dominates what I do. It's a weak excuse that I use to pardon my lack of living. Of course I'm not to blame, right? It's not my fault I'm not living the way I want to. I'm calling my own bullshit. You know what they say: the way you go about your day is the way you live your life. So what the hell am I doing? Nothing of much consequence. I won't say that everything I do is useless because I think relationships are important. I've built a lot of new and better friendships this summer and I think that's worth something. Cliched, sure, but what else am I here for? Spiritually I've grown a lot this summer, but only on the intellectual side of things. And I don't feel like I've really affected anybody else spiritually. If I don't do that soon, my faith will fester like a sore and then fade. I need to grow my faith outside myself or I'm going to suffocate. So what to do? Where to start? It starts in my thoughts, I know. So I actually think I've done well training my thinking: but that's only the beginning. It is only training for the action that should be flowing out of me and from my genuine faith. I'm going on vacation for a couple weeks. I'll be around crowds of complete strangers - a spiritually target-rich environment. This should be a proving ground for my faith. Now, I don't mean to say that I'm going to prance around Disney Land proclaiming God's love. Not with words, anyway. There are plenty of other ways to affect people in small ways and if I can't even manage those, what the hell good am I? How can I expect to show love if I can't show common courtesy? That's really what I'm talking about, because the 'happiest place on earth' often makes one turn into an asshole. This is what irritates me, though. I want to be doing bigger things than being nice to people. How easy is that? I feel so useless. I think San Diego, the next spot on my tour, will offer me some better opportunities. I should have the chance to go to my cousin's youth group there, so you never know what will happen. Maybe I'll find my inspiration there. Mainly though, I need to find it within myself. I always expect to be inspired, rather than to inspire. Maybe that's why I'm so spiritually ineffective.
