Could there be anything more sway then that for me? Another damn fucked three hours break, nothing to do also, walk around West Mall, play arcade, then head back to school. Fell asleep during demo, damn fuck. Just couldn't keep myself awake, and missed out the part how to do the bloody salad. Tomorrow confirm get fucked by trainer. No money, no ciggs, no nothing, no everything. WHAT ELSE COULD BE WORSE?
