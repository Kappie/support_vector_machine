From  urlLink  SomethingAwful's Link Of The Day  (July 31st) , someone discovered  urlLink  This   blog/Xanga/whatever the hell it is, and the irony is just too much. Oh, God. Another emo teenage girl with "guy problems". Oh, she cuts herself. What a walking cliche. Yeah, she and 17 million other teenage girls who put out frequently but have to maintain this bullshit image as little saints. And, even better, this was her reply to SA's article:    "how fucking gay for now on i make a commitment to try and spell all my words right because  ppl who dont know me are making fun of me for bad spelling...you know most the world cant spell for shit and everyone who starts posting on here becuase they read awful link of the day cant spell they are only going to spellcheck for the post they make on my zanga so they dont look like a totall dummass making fun of me..i say fuck you all get over yer perfectness of spelling just because im nikki and could give a rats ass if you ppl like my spelling or if its correct go fuck a tree im not commiting my self anymore i changed my mind in the last 30 seconds to never spell check agian!!!...ok will im probaly just ranting on about that shit beccause this past week i bin pissed coz ppl who must bitch and annoy bitching is my job when i want to its just a well kno nikki thing others its stupid and annoying and look theyve accomplished making me bitch..well anyways uhh yea brittaney stayed the week here and left today yesterday i had to go to sum gay park fair thing amabob and kc n shane came with me n brittaney ....wahooo i think i may of gone a litlle psyco yelling at sumpoints but who gives a shit ceartinly not me..  well goodaymates and those who hate  ~inally inlove with the right guy~"   I don't even know what to say to that. How about this:   "for now on i make a commitment to try and spell all my words right because  ppl who dont know me are making fun of me for bad spelling..."   Dear Lord...'for now on'. Um, the word is "from". And it's "try to spell". And "ppl" is not a cute, original, or insightful acronym. In fact, none are. Spell your fucking words. You've got no excuse to be a prissy little bitch. You're 17 years of fucking age. That's one year from being regarded as a legal adult. I assume you're been educated, or, at least sat in school. So don't play these little "Oh, I can't spell. Why is everyone so mean?!11" games with me. You know damn well about grammar and spelling, so use it. It makes it really difficult for intelligent people to read your dribble. Oh, well, I guess that's not a problem for your fellow illiterate emo/goth friends.   And...um...   "~inally inlove with the right guy~"   No, no you're not. You may think so now because:  a). the sex is amazing b). he gives you money and things c). you have him whipped d). he frightens you into loving him  Trust me, you're 17. It ain't love.  ---  Just felt the need to expand on that. Well, because, it is a fucking epidemic and I'm tired of reading poorly written bullshit. It's not hard to make something legible, assholes. Just do it. Oh, damn, their comebacks are always "well don't read it if you don't want 2 lolz". Actually, no. Don't give me your little passive, teen-liberal excuses. The internet is being infected with morons who reproduce by the millions every fucking day. Not only do you type poorly, but you also think the world revolves around you and your trivial little life, which consists of fucking, eating and shopping with your girlfriends who you'll eventually turn to when that one "special" guy abuses you. So, please, please just make a tiny effort to not look like a retard.  Thanks.
