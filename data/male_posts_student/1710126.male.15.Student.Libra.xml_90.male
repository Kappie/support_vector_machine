Defenceless. out of character for me ter do tt...really dun feel like going tomolo...coz got sorethroat oso...budden mabbe tts an excuse. U dun run away frm reality rite? So i'll go lahz. But i'll have ter see a doc soon too. Messenger is indeed a bad way of conversing serious stuff. I lose my ability to see the emotion changes and be tactful. Genial was rite. but whaddya do when ya feel maligned? apologise and hope it blows over i suppose. The thing is tt the sincerity may not be believed.   The bad thing about finding joy in little things is tt u tend to find sorrow in little things too. things tt are happening at every second of the day.   I dunno why but everytime they get close i repel them away. Its my fault. After so many years of examples n different ppl, i knoe whats the worse thing about me now. It is the one thing tht i prided myself on. Isn't it ironic? When ppl like u for what u r, when u r what ur not they will flip, coz u r tt one part of their life, and if ur gone they r lost.   I wonder how long it'll take for this hole to be filled. Will the cracks always be there?   Tact. i have no tact.
