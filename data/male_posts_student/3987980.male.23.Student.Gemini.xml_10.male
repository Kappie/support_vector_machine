First I noticed my car was leaking alot of coolant. A surprise considering my radiator was replaced only two months ago because that one was leaking. Then while returning to class from our food break, my car suddenly stopped working. The battery was dead. That could only mean my altenator has died (also replaced two months ago, by the same person, my step-father, a pattern?). Well I gambled my chances to get home, I made it half way. Car had to be pushed another 2 miles. Thankfully I got some help from some passerbys. There are good people in the world after all. One of them even offered to give me a ride to class in the morning. With that I'm signing out, 5 hours til I have to wake up. I wanted to write more about my life up til now, but I wanted to rant after today's events. Later
