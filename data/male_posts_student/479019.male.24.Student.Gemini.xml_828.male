I think I need to photocopy it now?  I'm tired, but I have a bunch of shit to do. I need to photocopy, meet up with someone, sit at a table, and make dinner.   Now playing  AM Radio  - "Hush"  Now playing  The Damned  - "I Feel Alright"... cause I skipped over AM Radio  So I think I'll be doing my paper on Hong Kong cinema for my postcolonial urbanism class. I really should do something on a larger global context, than always only doing the United States.  Oh yea... the bitch didn't advance on American Idol!!!  ***
