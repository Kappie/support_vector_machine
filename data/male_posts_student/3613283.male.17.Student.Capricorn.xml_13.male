First, on France 5's debate show with various guests who were all insisting that  lots of good things are happening in Iraq  and also saying that people should try to distance themselves from the pictures of attacks they see in the media because they said that after all,  there is life in Iraq and that freedom and democracy are coming.   Then, I switched to Canal+ which  usually is the socialist propaganda channel.  They teased a debate about Mike Moore's F 9/11 so I thought "Alright, this is going to be funny". Well, all the guests said that Mike Moore wasn't interested about the truth, that all he was doing was a fiction, not a documentary but that it was great to have this guy around. One journalist invited said he saw the movie and he found it  very disturbing and dangerous  if it was taken as actual information. Even the host uttered "Well, even if he isn't telling the truth..."  All in all, very weird day on French television.
