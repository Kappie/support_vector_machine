Saterday night....and god damn I want to see the nascar race tomorrow but my mum dont wanna move the tv into the living room (the tv in the living room crapped out and her tv in her room cant get the channel).   I'm so fucking bored.  Now when i say a weeks rest I mean this past week i've been at weight training for football (not fooseball), its been up and down. Tiring and fun.  learning stuff, hating stuff, noticing that i'm the only freshman (yea i can call myself that now) that doesn't laugh whenever the coach says shit (i mean when he doesn't mean it in a funny way).   2 Varcity(sp) guys hate me, 1 just likes my additude, and 1 just...dunno what he does.     I dont bench much atm or atleast doesn't lok like much (the bar itself is about 45lbs so ya), though everyday we increase the weight by 5lbs as of next week cause we didn't know we had to do it next week.   Man once i start benching close to my own weight (and tahts gonna fucking hurt)....well damn, wheres the NFL when ya need em.  Waking up the past week at about 8:30 every morning kinda buggin me, i was just dreaming of going to sleep at 4 in the morning and waking up at 5 in the afternoon.   but as i see it, it wont ever happen.  Disneyworld coming up in alittle more than a month, cant wait.  Miss my last week of training but wth, I CAN SLEEP FOR AS LONG AS I WANT.  WOOT!   Although its jsut really me, mom, and bro, so i'm just gonna be with them or maybe i might have a day with my dad (as you know he lives in florida).  This summer as very few know (very few), I might not be going to this one area up at Clear Lake called Pine Grove this summer.    You ask wheres/whats that?  its lika trailer park, but i've been going there since i was 6 months old.   Me grandparents went on a rather long trip into the east coast to see my to see their sister's b-day and to a baptizem (me sisters actually).    SO i might just miss going there this summer.    Rather bummed, but eh, we got ourselves a big trip to eastcoast too, so why bother.    Course i say that when this place is about to be ripped apart by a retarded new owner that is screwing the place too hell.     It might not be there in les sthan 5 years.  Tomorrow....boring, dont wanna do anything but sit and see if theres a radio station to listen to the nascar race thats takin place at infineon raceway....yep, fun stuff, good roadcourse for cars that only turn left.   Aight, i'm tired.  too much stuff i typed....byebye
