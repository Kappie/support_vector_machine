Frederick Schrock 16 October 2002 SSE 540 Journal Article Dr. Fusco  Education, Summer 2002 v122 i4 p674(6)   The Technology Hub: a cost effective and educationally sound method for the integration of technology into schools. Joseph S.C. Simplicio.   This article introduces an idea which should be more of a reality in grade schools: the technology "hub", a center at the school where information can be accessed and transferred by anyone involved with the school, whether inside of it or out. Many schools already have some form of a hub installed or planned; numerous schools have practically replaced their libraries with "media centers" where computers take the place that rows of books once held.  There are many benefits to the technology hub. The author mentions that teachers can write tests onlin for students to access later, possibly in a resource room setting. Parents can go online and see what assignments their children have to finish for the week. Students, teachers, and parents can utilize a school's website for district news, library resources, or to communicate by E-mail if there are any problems.  What the article emphasizes is the use of Internet media as a medium for this exchange of ideas. This has not come to fruition yet in public schools. Library media centers use poor filtering systems that block out pornography (sometimes) but also research articles on Margaret Sanger or Adolf Hitler. In turn, E-mail is also banned. Websites of schools often go a semester or more without being updated.   The most frustrating thing about the current situation is that the technology that is used is often not compatible with what the students use at home. I am writing this paper right now in a West Seneca district school that lacks a PC. A copy of the Simplicio article remains in a floppy disk in my jacket, as the Macintosh cannot read the .pdf file it is stored on. I would E-mail the article to myself, but the filter would not allow it. Uploading this paper to an Internet site that I could access later resulted in one of many messages warning me that anything I click on could be viewed by a third party, which somehow erased the completed first version of this essay. It will not be until schools accept online communication for what it is meant to be, and not treat it like a closed-circuit television channel, that the rewards of having a computer in every classroom will be realized.
