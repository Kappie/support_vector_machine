As a result I am:  A. spending every waking moment at the computer, diligently typing away so that I can be done with my first semester at school, impress all my teachers with my amazingness (amazingnacy?) and secure funding for next year.  B. Blogging my head off even though I have gone weeks without posting a thing just because it's not being productive.  C. Watching cable and eating cheezy poofs.
