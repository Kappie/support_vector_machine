WHEE   tell me what you thought about when you were gone and so alone the worst is over you can have the best of me we got older but we're still young we never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up  here we lay again on two separate beds riding phone lines to meet a familiar voice and pictures drawn from memory we reflect on miscommunication and misunderstandings and missing each other too much to have had to let go  we turn our music down and we whisper say what your thinking right now tell me what you thought about when you were gone and so alone the worst is over you can have the best of me we got older but we're still young we never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up  jumping to conclusions made me fall away from you i'm so glad that the truth has brought back together me and you  we're sitting on the ground and we whisper say what your thinking outloud  tell me what you thought about when you were gone and so alone the worst is over you can have the best of me we got older but we're still young we never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up   i need to make a public apology to my best friend. kara anne girod. i am so sorry for everything that we've been through this year. i think this song has a part that i really want you to know..the worst IS over..and you can have the best of me. i'm here now as your best friend and i'm sorry for everything. i'm really ecstatic (i wish i could use a big fat SAT word to make myself sound more intelligent) that we're past our epoch of decline and have had our awakening. we're on a good road now. YESS!  i had a really bad day today and then a really good day today. i think it's weird how things can even out. spencer's graduation party was today..and it made me really sad. i really like spencer gotter a lot, he's a really awesome guy and an even better friend. i think that i will definitely have to spend some time there this summer. i then got the honor of hanging out with the best girl around here and the best friends around here tonight too. it was great times.   you know life is really like a rollercoaster. even when it's down, you still have the up to look forward to. right? right.  i'm really tired and i'm sorry if this doenst make any sense to anybody. WHEEE!!   well i'm going to go now..i have to be at work at 7 AM tmw..BOO but yes for the CASH$$. g'night you crazy kids.
