Some things are more expensive than others, but in the end - the more you have, the more you get; and then you have more, and get yet more. Leonard Cohen summarized this nicely: "The poor stay poor; the rich get rich. That's how it goes. Everybody knows" (song called "Everybody knows"). This should not be a revelation, just more of a thing that one needs to admit before attempting to understand anything.  	Another thing: never try to force people to change rapidly, this will make it even worse, and that is not something you want to do. No specifi exapmles will be given here, as that would be rude, but today, once more, I realised soemthing. People would do anything to keep their world exactly as it is. Thats' just how it is. Even if it currently suck, even if they're on the verge of death, even if it's their doing too. Just keep it as it is. It's easyer this way  	People give up too easily nowadays too. Noone is willing to put up a fight, even if it may change their life for the batter.    Lyrics of the day Keywords: Hopeless, love, suicide  Counting Crows - Black And Blue  Fading everything to black and blue You look a lot like you Shatter in the blink of an eye But you keep sailing right on through Everytime you think you’re learning You just look a lot like me Pale under the blistering sky White and red Black and blue  You’ve been waiting a long time You’ve been waiting a long time To fall down on your knees Cut your hands Cut yourself until you bleed Fall asleep next to me  Wait for everyone to go away And in a dimly lit room where you’ve got nothing to hide Say your goodbyes Tell yourself we’ll read a note that says I’m sorry everyone I’m tired of feeling nothing goodbye Wash your face Dry your eyes  You’ve been waiting a long time You’ve been waiting a long long time To fall down on your knees Cut your hands Cut yourself until you bleed But fall asleep next to me  Have a dream I’m falling down On my face Scrape my knees Scrape my hands until they bleed she's fast asleep next to me Next to me Next to me Next to me
