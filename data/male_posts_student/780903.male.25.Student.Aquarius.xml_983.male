His (or her) post explains my post pretty well, which was basically that it kind of bothered me that someone would say that its site, which has been up for a week and is essentially a one-joke parody of Howard Bashman's  urlLink How Appealing  is funnier than mine, because, while it's amusing, it probably can't sustain for much longer, and is kind of mean-spirited anyway because Howard is a real person and not a faceless corporate institution.  Whatever.  I took  urlLink Overpundit 's post too personally and it's not a big deal, and that's why I deleted the post....   UPDATE:  urlLink Overpundit  makes nice in a follow-up post. UPDATE 2:  urlLink How Appalling  makes nice too.
