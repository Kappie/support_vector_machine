Then yesterday was also very busy, i thought everyone would be either staying at home or at the national stadium watching the parade. but no.. the whole nite was so busy with long queue. And causing me not being able to have a rest even for a minute.. Sian..  But even though it was a busy nite, the pay was double so it was not bad afterall. Yesterday i was being asked to open counter at level 1 again. The most busy level as it sells all those food stuff. But lucky yesterday manage to close at ard 1020. then after counting all the money, i found out that i was short of $2. sian, have to pay on the spot.  Don't know y also, yesterday was quite an unlucky day for me, it is that i keep dropping money onto the floor, then the whole coin container also drop.  It could be this reason that i lost the $2.  As for today, it is another day of practical lesson, for today's menu, there wasnt any demo as yesterday was a public holiday, the teacher only told us the ingredients and the steps that was to be done on the friday's demo lesson, even though there wasn't any demo shown, most of us still manage to cook the menu wonderfully.. hehe. Tasted the menu myself and found that it was not bad.. haha.. self satistyed..  Think that's all for nw, shall blog again tomolo if have the time.. Cheers Thomas
