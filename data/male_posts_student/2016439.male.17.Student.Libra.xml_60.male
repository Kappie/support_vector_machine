C move her stuff into her new room for next year, I informed her that I wouldn't be in her class next year.  I used a schedule conflict as my excuse, and honestly that is one of the main reasons I'm not taking the class next year.  I just conveniently left out the part about really not liking that class this year; I have to be tactful, after all :-)  Tomorrow is newspaper and history, both of which are basically non-finals.  I also have to ask Mr. M for a chemistry book to study this summer so that I don't suffocate in elements and equations next year in AP Chemistry (seeing as I haven't even taken chemistry at all).  Fun stuff.  Okay, so I'll try to make this short and sweet.  I've found in the last two weeks that it is becoming increasingly difficult to ask my parents for things.  In fact, it seems to be nearly impossible for me to ask my dad for something as simple as money, a bit of which I happen to need right now.  Maybe it's to punish him...or myself...or both of us.  I don't know.  My relationship with my dad is complex enough to write a book about.  The effects of it can be seen from everything as simple as my name to my ever-present trust issues.  I'm way too exhausted to try and go into details about why this is even important to me right now, but as I come into the last full summer before I go away to college (I don't count next year because who knows when I'll be leaving), I'm realizing that this is the last year for me and perhaps even most of my family to be close to each other.  I read a story about a woman who just had her fifteenth child, and how she still wants more.  As crazy as it is, you've gotta marvel at the love that's gotta be flowing through that family.  Insane?  Maybe.  But if you've got love, it doesn't matter.  Yeah, so I'm going to stop before this turns into some cheesy R love ballad.  In other news: Baylor LIFE stuff is sent in!  A week from now I'll be learning about free enterprise, hehe.  Damn military conscription!  Although it's only a remote possibility, we've got to smush even the thought of it.  Sra. H (another Spanish teacher) is definitely genial (it's foreign, don't worry).  I think she'll be able to help me out a lot in self-studying for the AP Spanish Lang  Lit tests since she taught AP Spanish before coming to Midway.  GO TROJANS!
