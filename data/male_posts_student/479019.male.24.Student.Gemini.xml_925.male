I’m going to say this now, as nice as the Sphere is as a venue… Buffalo is way too far to go for a show. 3 hrs each way, tolls, and paying for the extra mileage on the rental was too much of a hassle.  Anyway, I got to Buffalo without too many problems… I only almost killed myself skidding on wet pavement getting on an exit ramp. But I got to the venue around 5:30 PM and doors opened at 6…. So I went to go get some gas, so I wouldn’t have to do it when I was already tired after the show. I got back at 6 and parked. I’m gonna say it… the area was weird. It just had this ghost town vibe. It’s kind of like the area around the Glass House, only it was more like an old school town feel with just a few random stragglers. It’s an artsy area with potential that’s unmet. Or maybe it’s just because it was a Wednesday night.  The Sphere is probably the best-designed venue for seeing the stage I’ve ever been to. Everywhere you stand, you have a GOOD view of the stage. However, the acoustics in the place were horrible. It was an unintelligible cacophony for all the sets. Anyway it was a good crowd there was a pit going for all the bands. Let It Burn, the Unseen, Avail and the Bouncing Souls. Randy apparently dropped out of the tour last night due to financial problems. A MARXIST band with financial problems!? What the hell?  I thought Avail was much better than when I saw them open for Propagandhi, but I still think the extra singer is superfluous. I also liked the Souls’ set this time more too. It was a fun crowd with lots of dancing in the pit. However, I liked the NJ crowd better. They were way more energetic.   So I’m all done with everything. I just need to pack and stuff. I almost wish that I booked an earlier flight home.   I thought this  urlLink article  in the LA times was interesting…. Especially given  urlLink Minnow ’s recent posts on her xanga…. anyway this might piss her off to say this, but I think what those cities are doing is wrong. I believe that freedom of speech is something incredibly important, because you never know if putting restrictions on it could turn around and hurt the spread of progressive ideals. It’s the same thing as Neo-Nazi and KKK free speech. I think you should strive to be better than these people, because if they were in power… they would limit your freedoms.  ***
