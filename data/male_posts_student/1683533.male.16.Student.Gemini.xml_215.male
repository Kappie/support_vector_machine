I love it.  Spider-man 2 for PS2 is intense.  I got it 3 days ago and I beat the storyline, and I was sad at first and thought that was it.  But there is so much more to explore and do.  There are over 200 mini missions scattered all over new york, 150 skyscraper icons to collect, 125 bouy icons to get off of the bouys (spider man cant swim either) and the 100 or so secret icons to search for.  The map is enormous and it covers all of Manhatten from the ground up.  Nothing beats climbing to the top of the Empire state building, running off, then shooting a web out right before you splat on the ground.  I could spend hours just swinging around New York.  If you dont want to do all the exploration I still suggest you rent it and beat the storyline cause that is fun.  The narrator is also funny and Tobey McGuire provides funny lines as well.  I finally talked to Evan today (drummer) cause we havent practiced for months, its really hard to get everybody together during the summer cause we never see eachother.  Anyways, we are thinkin about doing something next week and we thought of a new name that is disclosed for now untill everyone agrees on it.  i guess that is it, Im very bored and I think Im gonna turn in soon.
