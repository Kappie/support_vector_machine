Wow, not being at school sure is fun; knowing I need not have an early morning for the next 8 weeks or so, doing only what I want to... gosh, I do pity those younger kids still at school. And those ones going into year 7 in September - they have 5 years of school. 5 years... Woah, it seems like such a long time ago I was in year 7, but... does it? I still remember it clearly... those PHSE lessons, those library lessons... it all went so fast. Yep, time is slowly slipping away. Makes you feel slightly old even; having left compulsory schooling.   Anywho, enough reminiscing, I have tales of old to speak of. Ok, so they're not really old. And they're not really tales, but hell, I'll put them down here anyway. Yesterday was a very good day, the second best day of my free time so far (after Thorpe Park least Tuesday). I got a crowded train and an empty tube up to South Kensington, met  urlLink nonnesuch ,  urlLink megatrobe  and  urlLink deutsches d then headed off through the tunnel to the London Scinece Museum, a truly excellent place. Plenty of good stuff to have a look at, with lots of computer touch screen things to twiddle round with. Spending about 3 hours in there, we sallied forth to a small shop not so far from the museum where we purchased ourselves some lunch which we ate on the lawn in front of the Natural History museum (just down the road from the science museum). With a quick consumption of our food, next was the natural history museum, looking at lots of dead things in jars, and dinosaur skeletons and models of strange animals. Wasn't as good as the science museum, but nice architecture though.  urlLink Nonnesuch  was good enough to point this out about once every 15 minutes :D But it  was  a good building though. I'd like a building like that...  Getting home after that fun-filled day, I found that my legs were extremely painful, most probably because I'd been standing up all day (instead of playing on the computer, chess, or reading), but they're better now, thankfully.  So, what has the Davester been doing today then? Not much at all really. :( A little bit o' internet, but mainly reading Reaper Man, and playing on that aforementioned chess computer. However I have found an excuse for losing on it a few days ago. I had to replace the battereies, and after putting new ones in, it set back to the default level, which is certainly more... challenging than good ol' level 1, which I cam beat easily, of course. And finally... I got out my old Atari 2600, modled here in all it's 1980s glory   Yep, old isn't it? Quite interesting though, to see how far computer games have come in the past few years. Apparently we bought it in 1993, for Â£30. Well, this is probably the best game we have for it, entitled "River Raid"   Looks quite lame, doesn't it? It is. :( Well, I still have the megadrive, and if I really want to be ahead of the times, I could even have a go on my Play Station, with 3D games! Woah, a bit wild for me :)  Anywho, ta ta for now my dear readers.   Weather:  Windy, then rain, now drizzle. Miserable day.  Reading:  Reaper Man  Listening to:  Fellowship of the Ring Soundtrack - 'May It Be'  Watching:  Nowt really  Confused about:  Why I got aching legs so easily  Annoyed with:  Nowt really  Mood:  Rather good
