And i went to Sherwood shell station to pump petrol... only 89cent which is also very cheap considering the fact that its saturday and the price of petrol increased..  At night at about 10:30pm me, Giri, Nadine, Suzzaannne and Joseph had a game of Monopoly... It was a great game!!! I managed to buy all the train stations in about 3 rounds... and everybody kept patronising it! Yeah,.. the the funny thing was when all 4 of them landed on my stations in the same round... Hahaha... i was good.... ^_^ Well i guess i better got sleep lor... Try wake up early start doing something more productive like packing up my room for shifting, packing my laugage for home...and ofcourse studying for my final exam next friday!
