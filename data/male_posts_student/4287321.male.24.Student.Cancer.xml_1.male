I knew it's already popular and has been around for ages but the reason i did not do so was because i've always felt lazy of writing anything, more ever posting it online!! LOL! It was changed after i've came across few of my friends blogsite and find it rather interesting with the idea expressing our thoughts. Well maybe it'll be my new found hobby of passing my time since there's nothing much to do online nowadays. I just don't feel as enthusiatic and over-hyped as i used to be anymore. I don't know. Started to blog right after i've created this account but i'm quite concerned because Adrian(my beloved god sister's boyfriend) told me i need to pay in order to use blogspot. Yeap, it's safe to assume that he knows all this because he's a former user of blogspot and experienced the event that i'm concerned about. Guess i'll switch to other domain if i really need to pay for it. Bah! So much for this s0-called "free" blog site.  Anyway's, went to makan at Wang's Footcourt and man!! Dad ordered tons and tons of food for us. We had chinese rice with one whole chicken(yeah, i know there's bird flu in the country recently but don't give a damn), grilled ikan pari, and 5 bowls of soup which is szechuan, some pork stomach, black beans, vege and some soup which i do not know what it's called in English. Went home feeling like a pregnant woman and watch a chinese drama while waiting for Malaysian Idol to start. Really had a great time watching MI although got a lil' irritated by the short commercials. What to do lar bro? It's sponsored by TMNet and it's a torture to see all of the stupid and irritating commercials promoting broadband. Most of the contestant were suprisingly impressive this week as some of them were quite a letdown last week. Saiful was doing utterly bad for the 2nd consecutive week with Fahmy forever singing his boring tunes, and both of them might get the boot this week. Haha anyway this were just my opinions and it's the public who decides who's to stay. Please don't chop me for that okay? Not to say i voted for each of them anyway *grins* Told Joan about it and she was so excited and can't wait to watch it. Hope she gets to download each of the clips later.  Aldrin came to my place shortly when i was just started talking to Joan. He invited me for yumchar session and suggested that we should wait for Jeffrey to come back from a 'date' with his supervisor some where around Pantai Kundur. Yeap, his supervisor is a male but don't get any ideas coz they're there to enjoy ikan bakar. Can't wait to eat there tomorrow coz it's Jeffrey's treat muahaha. The wait was worthwhile as we set our journey to a mamak stall at Kota Laksamana, not too far from my place. Once we reach there, we was wondering why it's so empty coz it's always packed on friday night and realised it's the 7th month on chinese calender a.k.a The hungry Ghost month. Sounds spooky enough.  We crap there as usual and we had a great time scaring Aldrin with our ghost stories coz Aldrin is going back by bike later. Huahuahua all alone!! Jefrrey got freak out shortly and we had to stop our conversation on that topic. Case Closed! Went on to crap till 1.50 AM and had to leave as Jeffrey was getting really sleepy. After all, he have to work tomorrow. Back on my pc and i'm waiting for Joan to come online again. I guess i'll end here for now. Laters!
