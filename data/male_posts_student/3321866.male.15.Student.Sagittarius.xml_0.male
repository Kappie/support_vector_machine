Me being the impatient one didn't quite listen so I just randomly played. Then we went to Claytons and had fun there and ate and oddly we all ordered the same thing...The waitress was great cause she put up with Chris's antics and we had fun. We walked Steph home and then found a shopping cart and tried to lewer CJ away from Emo ball. We failed so we went to video land and rented  "Better Off Dead"  and that was fun and Chris and James meet my grandparents and saw my little brother amuse them and my room which is cool I guess and Steph came and was scared by Chris and James. That was fun. Today my mom says "your shoes are too small" so we bought some Converse at the exchange that are navy blue and are cool and I also got some cool shirts that my dad owned when he was young and they look like something Gordo would wear so there cool. I'm going to wear them on Tuesday :). This is my life....Cool.
