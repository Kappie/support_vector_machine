School was ok too. I think this older lady, in her late 30's or early 40's, likes me. She sits near me in one of my classes and she always stares at me and is looking at me. When I return her look, she looks away real quick. Maybe I have a booger or something every morning and she doesn't have the heart to tell me.   I must stay foceussed on school and work. That is my priority. I can not detour from that!
