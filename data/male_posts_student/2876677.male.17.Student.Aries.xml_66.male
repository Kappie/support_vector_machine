She said, "Everytime I have seen you today, you have been putting food to your mouth."  So true.  What's the problem with that?  Breakfast-Cereal Bar.  Brunch-Croissant.  Lunch-Pizza(quarter).  Early Afternoon Snack-Animal Crackers.  Mid-Afternoon Snack-Ice Cream.  Late Afternoon Snack(Now)-Pizza(whole).  I can't wait for dinner.  I'm a glutton.  So what?
