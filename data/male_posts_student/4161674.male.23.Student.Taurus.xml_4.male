Practical, simple, generic or cheap. The most for my money, BOGO’S can’t be beat.  Coupons, credits and special offers Often eat up more time, Than fill up the coffers.  When columns are straight And numbers add up, No questions’ too hard  As long as it don’t cost too much.  Payday, profit, excess or flush. Money’s no object when you’re in the glow of Friday’s blush.  Life is stable, my butt’s off the hook, When I manage to maintain balance in my Blue checkbook.
