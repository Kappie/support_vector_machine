OH MAN...FREAKY.  So, now, tell me again, why do I share my life with you. You who read it, Are you entertained? Do you want to be entertained? Am I just another link in your favorites list? Do you quote me random phrases off it to show that you read? That you care perhaps? Perhaps I'm wishing.   Perhaps I write to improve myself. To prove to myself? To reflect. The most common excuse yet the most sensible. Do I want to be noticed? Read up on? Cared for? Loved?  Yes.  I was thinking today. About something I've just forgotten. A very worthy insight. Wasted. No matter, think about this. When, you want to see somebody, you'll keep seeing them even if it's not them.. If you can't relate to what I mean, wait till you fall in love.   You will.
