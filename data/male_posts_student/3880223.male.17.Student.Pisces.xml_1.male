I really have to eat a lot tonight to compensate for my damaged brain cells...oops, sorry...damaged neurons cannot be replaced right? damn! I mean, after my "brain cell contortion" act during the Math exam, I still have no idea if I have enough brain cells left to understand my Chem pre-lab for tomorrow...=(  I think I am becoming really stupid these days...I got a 10 out of 19 in English, I can't understand this story entitled Rebecca in Lit, then these damn conic sections and systems of equations just screws the hell in my day...oh what a perfect life!  I mean, I thought that I really had a good chance of nailing my subjects this year. After high school, I thought college would be more simple...but life really has a lot of suprises...especially here in the Ateneo...life's just pretty damn hard out here!!!  But I am not angry. I am just pissed of. Those Math exams can really bring out the evil inside of you. I mean, those math problems, they were like evil in the mathematical form or something...
