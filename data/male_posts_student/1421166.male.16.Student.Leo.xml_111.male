But then again, I'll have to do my Chemistry as well. Gosh...what trouble have I brought upon myself.  Oops...realised that it's past 12. Which means by today's meant the day before. Oh well, yesterday then, was rather boring. I mean besides doing my homework, practically nothing. Besides SMSing Yen and answering a few calls. But, quite enough to brighten up my night. Yen told me to look out into the night sky. Well, in this situation what more can I expect than stars. It was nice, and beautiful. But incomparable to other nights I've seen overseas. But made me wonder enough about what's behind them. Just look behind it, from fiery beauty to vacuum. Oh well, of course God's behind them to be honest. But still, quite enough of stars and encouraging words to light things up.  Feel the breeze, Hear the leaves, See the glittering Stars, Through the mist. Along which Our sorrows lift, Behold! How joy and beauty Interweave.  by God through Annabelle (She puts it that way)  Oh well, everyone's into the stars thing. Hidden stars, faint rainbows, to everybody, it seems like they are finally revealed to the human eye. Inspiration is in the air...coupled with wind. Poems everywhere. Yen said she has to write one before she sleeps and kinda encouraged me to write one too. I wrote one on Monday pass 12am. Though it's kinda like the opposite intent in many people. Oh well, I'll try to write one. Just that my rooms air-conditioned, so guess all the inspiration is low in the air.  Happy Birthday Yen and Min! Their birthday...which means it's the 30th! Ok...3 more days to school reopen. Oh gosh...I just hope I won't get into too much trouble next year. This is the time when you hope that the rest of the well, did only as much homework as you did.  Alright...time to Orb to dreamland or as in Annabelle's Contemporary English Dictionary, off to Lala Land. But on second thoughts, maybe I should stay of to do homework. Oh well, as the flesh leads. *haha*
