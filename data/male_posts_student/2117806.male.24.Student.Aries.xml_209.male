He wanted what the  original  said, so as to know the guy I was quoting wasn't just making shit up, as it were). Well, they had the document on microfilm over at the library. Wonderful--that means I can get it. But there was a snag--in order to get a copy of it, I needed some cash to get photocopies, and I had none. So I had to run to Wal-Mart to get some money (and some batteries for my discman). Then I had to go somewhere to break the twenty, 'cause there was no way I was gonna put that whole thing on my ID for photocopying and stuff. So anyway, I was up against a deadline, 'cause I realized I needed to do this around 4.30, and the library closed at 6.00 today. So I rushed--and made it. Got my money, got my source, and I'm going over it now to figure out what to include.  Well, back to the grind.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Tom Petty  the Heartbreakers, "Built to Last"
