Nicki was supposed to be comeing over to do my revision for me...erm...help me with my revision.  Round this time of year I get this obsessions for salads of all varieties, and being on study leave I've had even more time to make them. My mum's kinda getting angry cos the fridge is slowly filling up. I have to lean on the door to make it close. Oh well, all the more food for me!  Exams tomorrow. PE and ICT. Well, who gives a flying monkey's about PE (well, actually I do a bit), I mean its only PE. But, being a SPORTS COLLEGE its a bloody compulsery GCSE. Stuipid school. As for ICT>well, seing as our first teacher did naff all with us in the first year, our new teach spent all the time resuscitating our coursework, and so as a result we have no theory. I'll just have to play it by ear. Its ony 20% of the GCSE after all.  I just missed out on a job actually. There's a computer shop in my town called 'The Computer Shop' (wow) and they aren't getting any computers sold, so they asked me (after I dropped a CV in) to play my trumpet outside, and they'd have a whipround at the end of the day, and I could put my case on the ground and catch a few pennies. Sounds great doesn't it. But then of course Chelmsford bloody Town bloody Council have to go and bloody say "You need a license". Bastards. Oh well. Back to the drawing board. I'm making money now by massacring a dead tree in our garden for my parents. Its quite fun actually, if a little boring (if that makes sense).  If you haven't already worked out what the o-iii  I'm sorry if this seems a bit like an essay (that's what Ricki says at least), but I've got a lot to talk about.  Oh yeah, be warned, I will probably get into a nasty habbit of URL spamming. Click a few, they're usually good.  Thats all I can think to write about for the mo, more to come later (unless I forget)
