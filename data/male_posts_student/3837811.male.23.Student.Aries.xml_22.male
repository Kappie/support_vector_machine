Being an avid Manchester United Fan its sad to see C Ronaldo cry, but i just cant help it!! WOOHOOO.. Greece ROcks..    Im loving the MOMENT, wahahaha  In the middle of the match, this joker came on the pitch, ran around like some drunk buggers, taunting officials and ran into the goal net himself, talking about being netted, haha. He wore a t-shirt with this weblink  urlLink http://www.jimmyjump.com  ... Haha, i tried to go to the webbie twice but loading was damn slow, hope can get in one of these days.. haha    Figo NOT interested, haha  Today woke up to see Suzanne Jung on CNA at around 7+am. Wooo, i nearly forgot she existed, after sleeping till late noon everyday during my slack life. Haha. She is CUTE, now i will get to see her everyday before i go to work, haha.. Sad to say, i cant find her pic anywhere, tried mediacorp website, cna website, searched for it on Yahoo/Google images search, but to no avil. Lets just hope FHM do something about it. LOL  My colleague, who lives in Hougang, told me that taking an mrt is WAY faster than taking bus 147 to our workplace (Gan Eng Seng Pri Sch), so i went to take the NEL at Serangoon Station and transferred to Redhill at Outram Park. And to my disgust, it took me one hour to reach the school, including the torturous walk from redhill mrt to the school.. Just beat taking bus 147 by 15mins. I rather take this 15mins extra to alight right in front of the school gate, then to take the bloody walk. Haha    I LOVE THIS BUS!! LOL  I worked as an education trainer for my company, to teach the pri sch kids about doing business.. Those little angels wrote up a proposal, and learnt about doing a presentation to boost their business, so cute sia. P4 have to try to sell their cookies (yes they will bake the cookies themselves), P5 have to organise a party of 20 people.. Haha, dont see me doing that when i was in pri sch.. Anyway since today is youth day, there's no class, but need to help them print out the brochures they had done... so went back to the sch to use the printer.. Tinking i will be home soon, the printer is always jammed-up, or the network gives some stupid error.. JAM JAM! Arghhhh.. and we've got like 50 groups to print, And the printer/network kept Jamming, DAMN IT!    JAM IT! I rather have this kind of Jam, LOL  Anyway, seeing their brochures for the 1st time, i must hand it to them, coz if they really do biz themselves, i tink they will go bankrupt, but they are still kids, cant blame them.. wahahaha. Im sure they had been taught how to make a brochure attractive.. But these came out... Haha  Tip 1: Have more promotions, attract more customers, but.....    80% OFF!! Haha, why not organise party for free? LOL  Tip 2: Put in more colourful pictures, to catch customers' attention, But.....   Pokemon Number 55 Name: Golduck (evolution of Psyduck) Height: 170 cm (wooohhh shorter than me)  Weight: 77 kg  (wooohhh lighter than me) Haha, i not a fan of pokemon, got these info on the web, hahaha But what to do, they are still kids, haha, aint they cute doing these little brochures..
