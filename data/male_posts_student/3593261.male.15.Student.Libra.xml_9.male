I think I almost lost my cool when she said this  "Chester i luv U! U r so handsome,sexy,hot  especially in Numb! says: no juz joking..."  Damn that bitch...it's so rare of me to scold others..but this time..I really got to admit it...I lost my patience..damn damn damn...  After pestering me with those questions, she becomes a rowdy bird's nest...my MSN messenger kept beeping endlessly...GOD! I nearly on the verge of insanity... I've decided to block her...well, I felt very bad so, after a few minutes of though, I've decided to "release the bird from the cage"...Well, she stopped pestering me anymore..perhaps, this will be her last attempt...  There's nothing special today...Went to religious class, came back and studied A.Maths and went online..and played a little bit of WC3...it's fun..especially fooling around with imbecile Asian players...I kept toying them with a great tactic...  Hmmm...I did taunt Asian players...maybe, retribution will come and have revenge on me..Perhaps I should be more careful with my words...I don't want to repeat the same stupid mistake again....   I wonder how my friends are doing...I assume they are studying..Well, I can't afford to lose....losing means I lost everything...and that, I have learnt a very valueble lesson...   Sometimes in life, I've just need to relax...that's what Siew Ling said to me...she's right..I should relax..but I don't know how...Broy did give me some tips...but it won't! Perhaps I should study less....it gives me a blow in the mind..especially screwing me up in the examination hall...
