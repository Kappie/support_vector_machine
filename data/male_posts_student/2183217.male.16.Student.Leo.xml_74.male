So then kayla goes, Smith pitt? and im like no i said smith stiff! so matt says no you didn't you said sniff spiff! kayla says what? Spith Smith? So i says to both of them i says NO i said SWIFT PIT! .... Stiff sniff!!! kayla exclaims. Spiff Smith! matt replies. Splif stiff? i  ask? NOOO stiff pit!! the both scream. OH yeah , what were we talking about again? THEN the TV has the excellent idea of putting a dislexic baby with mechanical eyelashes on that wears a book on his head as a poor excuse for a hat and the mom "tickles it" with one finger... that makes me so mad.
