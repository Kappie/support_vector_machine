Later, my dad drove me to Arab Street to eat Nasi Briyani. Long time never eat nasi briyani. It was a nice meal. I talked to my father about our trip on this coming thursday . I usually dont talk much to my dad. I usually answer the questions that he ask me. But he is still my dad and I will always love him.   I will going to Malacca with my parents on Thursday. It is great time to get closer to them.Bonding time Went to gym in the evening with my fren. I think I really had a good workout. Running on tread mills, carrying weights and so on. I feel quite tired now.
