(sigh) im just a mess guys. congrats to aunty for getting that coach bag. laura  suzy--yours is coming!! promise!! soooooo...oh yeah, before i forget--these plans arent for sure yet, but my parents are going away for memorial day weekend, and i hopefully get to stay home. my plan is (and its ok with the parentals, but dont mention it yet) to have a bunch of church ppl over and a few ppl from school, and have a pool/hot tub/dinner/movie party! that would be so much fun, huh? laura's helping me plan it i think haha
