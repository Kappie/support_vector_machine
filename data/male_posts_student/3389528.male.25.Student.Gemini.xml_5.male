I'm saying goodbye to Boston and hello to the Village, via New York, and Ohio.   Wow. The Village.  It's been awhile.  So many emotions surrounding that place.  To be frank, I intend to do nothing but focus on my job as a counselor, but dammit I'm gonna have fun doin it.  No, I haven't really done that in the past.  We'll see. peace
