It starts off and ends with a naturalistic ambient sound, accompanied by that funky Australian aborigine instrument (you know the one i mean), then builds to an interesting synthesized crescendo. Rockin' good fun for all involved.  urlLink Listen here.  You'll need RealOne Player and a decent connection. Unless you don't like this song. Then you really don't need anything. Unless you want to write to me to complain about it. Or something.  End Transmission.
