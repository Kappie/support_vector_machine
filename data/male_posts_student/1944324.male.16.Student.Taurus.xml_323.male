I'm going to keep the archives up here at blogspot, but I'm moving the Journal part of the site to SquareSpace, where you will get to access a special section of the website. Cool, huh? But the journal is prettier and I like it a whole lot better.  I'm just going to blog right here from Compendium for daily crap.  I'd like to remind you of this. My site is very nice, and you might enjoy it, But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!  ETA: Journal is  urlLink here
