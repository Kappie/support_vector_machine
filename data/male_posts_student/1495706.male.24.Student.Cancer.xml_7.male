And it's conveniently located next to the liquor store (hell, everything is conveniently located next to a liquor store around here), so I'm happily sipping on Vodka with Fanta orange.  It's like a screwdriver in theory, with the practical assistance of a Vodka-redbull (which I used to love, but lately...not so much).  Sugar and carbonation kick up the alcohol an extra notch, which is a faster path to happiness!  And I'm listening to music through nice, new headphones, since the old ones were just...fading.  They served me well, though, so I can't complain; only mourn their passing.    Which means...I have Vodka and (good, in my opinion) Music.  Because I'm in my room, I can bust out with some dancing.  And that, good friends, is my personal formula for drunkenness: Vodka, Music, Dancing.  And I'm a happy drunk, so I'm in quite a pleasant mood.  I felt like sharing that.
