That which is denied gains power, and seeks strange and unexpected forms of manifestation.   Deny Death and other forms of Suicide will arise.   Deny Sex and bizzarre forms of its expression will torment you.   Deny Love and absurd sentimentalities will disable you.     Deny Aggression only to stare eventually at the bloody Knife in your shaking hand.   Deny honest Fear and Desire only to create senseless neuroticism and avarice.   Deny Laughter and the world laughs at you.   Deny Magic only to become a confused robot, inexplicable even unto yourself.
