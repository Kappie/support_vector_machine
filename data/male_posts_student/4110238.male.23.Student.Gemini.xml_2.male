It's sad how excited I am, but I don't really care.  Technology rules...and so what if I'm like a couple of years behind everyone else.  Anyway it's a camera phone with a sweet color screen, "polyphonic ringtones" (I love that phrase!), and lots of other gadgets and features that I totally don't need but am completely going to love!  Plus I upgraded...now I get more text messages (I've been using a lot lately), multimedia messages, and wireless Internet access.  Isn't that crazy?  Isn't it fabulous?  Hell yeah!!!
