AHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hahahah. so once again, we try to finish unloading the truck, and we actually suceeded! YES GIRLS!! GOOD WORK! ;) .....the lunch came from costco, and when they opened the pizza boxes, katy and i look at eachother like: yeah...im not eating that crap! the sausage looked like rat turds LoL! so, the 3 of us wound up eating the vegetarian pizza instead--good stuff, I GUESS. but us CV ppl are used to the better things i life, i guess you could say. the day is almost over, but i cant get ahold of my dad to come and pick us up from the middle of nowhere! bill kelly, of course, offers the 3 of us a ride home..and the homely woman, naomi glen, from church too. LoL!!! the car ride home was the best part of all, i SWEAR! we get in the "pimpster" car-van that bill kelly owns, and the 3 of us are crammed in the back. it starts off quiet, with us just checking out the scene. so, laura then starts talking about how she didnt know that part of town even existed, and we just joined in..as soon as you know it, we're all making alien voices, and talking weird. we did it for like 10 minutes, and naomi is just sitting in the front seat rolling her eyes, wishing she had a gun--all day, laura and i were saying how she looked like she wanted to murder one of us LoL!! "po po nah choi ton" or w/e language the 3 of us were speaking in the back was TOTALLY AWESOME! then, we just started talking about how ppl were looking at us and talking about us like we were stupid, just b/c we were from CV! LoL! we must have made bill and naomi think that we were drunk b/c we were laughing @ EVERYTHING! naomi's hair was blowing in the wind, and we just laughed like we just saw a funny movie LoL! THE BEST DAY TODAY I SWEAR!!! good times you guys...oh yeah, and almost forgot that when we were moving stuff, laura handed me this metal thing..so i turned around to find out what it was, and it was a TAMPAX DISPOSER LoL!! "Womens Napkins" was what it was labelled LoL!! MOTHER DUCKLING! LoL! see you guys tonight, when we go and get everyone back...oh yeah, almost forgot--laura and katy's house, and MY house got TP'd really bad. we got notes written in shaving cream on our steps, rice in our lawn, and i got wet toilet paper--its ok though, b/c they're gonna pay tonight! bye everyone!
