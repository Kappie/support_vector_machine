Sat at the bench in front of the toilet saw amin n started a converstion. When through another stupid tutorial. Stupid mr soh had to miss another 1 of his lessons so we spent 2 hours at the sports hall. Reached the sports hall to find a empty hall except for 1 court.Guess who's playing my best pals edmund lulu and ashley. So the entire sports hall had like 15 ppl and it's like the whole place nos mi. I guess i'm well liked.-lol- Played badminton, table tennis and squash. Poor sean, the squash ball hit his head with maximum impact..... i think the head blue black liao  Then went for kampong's semester project lesson, was crap since i  literally enter the class room said everything was in a CD-rom since he got no labtop to see my presentation n left. Went to play table- tennis  again second time today. The guyz really liked sports man...Had another crappy lesson for Pd suppose to perform for the class. Tot every1 did not do the thing so i heck care with sean but turns out every1 so hardworking. only amin,jane mi and sean no group. but jane n amin join other groups leaving mi and sean hung out to dry......Win liao lor every1. So when every1 was performing i was writing a scribe. Took mi only 10 mins to finsh the play. Acted it out with sean, was quite a sucess consider the fact tt i did not write my lines had to think of wat to say tt very moment. Surprisingly i was not anxious or anything. My last min play even got compliments from jocerlyn. Went to library after PD. Sat there with sean while we waited for the rest. Weian and the other guyz came. They sat down and started tokin. It  like i was invisible and they were chatting between themsleves. They were so nice as to invite to sit somewhere else so they can tok bout some private stuff. I feel left out by them lor. Anyway dun wanna tok bout it too much bout sad stuff. Cya guyz till like sunday..... my com spolit i lazy to use the laggy 1.-waves two hands - _________________________________________________________________  steph- dun think too much hor ...... n yeah u wanna noe wat happened ar,  tell u in private here a lot ppl can see.......
