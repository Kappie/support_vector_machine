The tornado moved south-southeast and just missed Humboldt by about 2.5 miles. I live on the north edge of town, so I stood outside a little while trying to see it...(the rest of the time I was inside with my radio listening)  I never caught any glimpses of it. I did see a very very dark set of clouds move just north of us. I can almost guarantee the tornado was in it. For about 5 minutes the sky got a puke kinda greenish color, and the storm stopped. I thought the tornado was going to hit...but it never did.  This morning my youth pastor called and a bunch of us went out and helped in Bradgate. You had to park almost 2 miles out of town because of the peope helping. Then the cops shuttled us in on busses. When we went in the town was pretty decent on the east side...but as you moved west, the houses were completely hammered. There were ambulances everywhere, fire trucks from everywhere too. It was amazing how many people where there to help. They even had a correctional facility there from Rockwell City.  As we were shuttled through the town I also happened to notice the Humboldt sherriff's car. This particular car is always parked outside of a house by Jadie's (my girlfriend's) house. The guy is her neighbor. His windows were all busted in and the car had debris all over on the inside of it. The first one to report the tornado was our sherrif. He went to Bradgate in the Sherrif marked SUV. Then the tornado hit and he went into the ditch. A 2x4 hit him in the leg and he called for help. I saw the SUV later that night as I was driving around town. The SUV had no windows, and was terribly crunched up.  Luckily for everyone...not too many injuries. A couple people had stepped on nails and they went through their feet. As a matter of fact; more people have been physically injured while cleaning up the debris than got hurt in the actual tornado itself. However, the emotional hurt must be great...  My church group and I ended up helping out a farm just outside of town a couple miles. After moving trees for a couple hours we left. Our work was done. But on our way home we noticed that there was debris from the houses in Bradgate almost 2-3 miles outside of town...quite amazing!
