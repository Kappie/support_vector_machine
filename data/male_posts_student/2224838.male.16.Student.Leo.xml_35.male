For those who haven't seen the trailer, Big Fish focuses on the relationship between a father, who tells his life story as a string of tall tales, and his son, who is only looking for the truth about his father's life. What I found to be cool about the movie was the larger than life feel it had, as if there were no limits to the size of the stories. Just like any other Tim Burton movie, it had a pleasantly strange look and feel. Furthermore, the cast was awesome, including people like Ewan McGregor, Danny Devito, and strangely enough, Steve Buscemi.
