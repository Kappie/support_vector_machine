There were at least 400 tourists staying at their house, so we elected to sleep out in the Garage. Me, Chris, and Erik sat ourselves down in front of the TV after a day of swimming for some video games and arguments on the nature of music. Today we spent a few hours cleaning out my car. Chris did most of the work because most of the garbage was his.   Unfortunately, I didn't get enough sleep the last two nights because I wasn't at home, where I am the only one in the house, and I have peace and quiet. I'm really at a loss for what to type.  Basically, all I have been thinking about today is how tired I am. I'd really like to put something more interesting down, but I won't.
