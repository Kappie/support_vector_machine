I have known men far greater than me That have and lost the battle The battle of chance that I could possibly be condemned to these barbed-wired walls An eternity living by rations An eternity living by work An eternity losing all feeling of entirety Self lost A man does not go crazy due to his surroundings A man goes crazy because he lets himself be hurt A man goes crazy by thinking of his future   Hoping that tomorrow everything will be better But I know better The walls in which I know now are The only walls I will ever know I have no family My only family is in the walls with me Sharing the day to day life of cold Day to day life of callousness Day to day What if I could leave this place? Why can’t I leave this place? Why do I bother trying to leave this place? This place The place to destroy men To bear witness to destruction Freedom comes soon Or does it? I can’t live waiting Live wanting Live waning But that’s how I live Without life Tomorrow will only bring the pain again Why bother with sleep? It will only bring on tomorrow.
