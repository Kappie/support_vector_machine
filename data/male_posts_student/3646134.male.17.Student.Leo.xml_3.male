I'm talking to Katie again :S.  This is my ex g/f.  We were together for a year and it ended veeeeery badly, and we kept falling out etc etc, I blocked, deleted and generally avoided her.  But then she apoligised and we started talking again.  I've been told off by many people.  lol.  Currently she's flirting with me like I'm the last man on earth and she needs to breed with me to ensure the survival of humankind.  Blah.  Why didn't I juuuuuust tell her to leave me alone :s lol.  Now she's phoning me.  Woohoo!  :|  It was a good day though otherwise :D me + Jonny B went to first lecture to do our coursework (like the good little boys we are (A):p ) and after that, thought... hmm... 3 lectures left... can I be bothered?  Nah :D went over Matt's house, spent the day eatting and playing PS2 games, then everyone came back to mine.  Yet again, Wilson decided he could beat everyone at everything.  Then we all kicked his ass and he went off home in a strop :p silly boy!  :p anyway, I'm tired, sleepy time!
