I was paintballing - an event that is to take place on Sunday night at Flag Raiders. However I was indoors in some sort of ice - rink/mall setting - didn't seem like our local mall at the time (which does indeed feature an Ice Rink, oddly enough). The paint was purple. The masks were smelly and uncomfortable, as per usual. Paul (old Paul) shot me in the hand at the same time I shot him in the hand.  At that point I noticed that no one else was wearing a mask - naturally I was alarmed - but from what I garnered this had become standard practice. Fearing for my expensive new eyes, I retreated, though to wear I was unsure; also I found myself steeped in nervousness due to a lack of barrel-plug (spark plugs??) availability (a major Paintball(tm) no-no when not on the field). Suddenly these massive overhead spinning hoses (this shit was not what you'd call a sprinkler) turned on and began distributing an almost Nikelodeon like cascade of purple paint - to the point where I fled to the safety of a small nook behind a collumn. It was at this point that I woke up coughing. Bizarre.    As I usually do when I get ill I woke up drenched in sweat cluntching at the covers screaming for my slain parents. Question the first: When I'm sick, why do I always think I'm Bruce Wayne?    I'm going to attempt to get some more work done on that article I'm writing ( I guess it's rapidly moving from article to "chapter"). Rough draft is due Aug. 1 and I'd hate to disappoint.    Throat's still swollen. I'm hoping, at some point today, to drop my Xbox off to Andrew and have him softmod it while I wait in the car. I dont' want to infect anyone.    Did Bastion's TF in City of Heroes last night. Got laid out like a cheerleader on prom night: Several times by all the boys. Oddly enough INTO and OUT OF debt probably six times during the entire TF. Got a prize I can't use for three levels. *rolls eyes*    If anyone's bored, drop me an IM or an email or a phone call. I can't talk, but I can "mmhmm" with relative ease.
