Went to work, got chewed out for stupid little stuff, had a bad morning, but Cindy and Cindy picked me up from work, we went and rented a car for Dos for her trip to Phily. I had to rent it since Cindy doesn't have a credit card. So the car is in my name. I told Cindy I'd feel more comfortable if she took my car and I took the rental this weekend, just so if something happens, the car(s) are covered by insurance.  They drop me off and they head to Golden Port. I continue to work on the website. Cindy and Cindy bring me some leftovers (which were fantastic, even cold) and I finish my day in a grumpy mood.  I get home and Cindy V. is gone. So sad, I missed her the entire weekend. Laura and Cindy get there and Linda comes over. We're all going to Raging Burrito for dinner (we's got's coupons!). Kerri comes over, a bit late, and Linda tells us in the car she has to go at 7, which was like 10 minutes from then.  We sit down, order our food, our waitress takes forever to do anything (I'm so impatient with people whose jobs are to serve me) and we eventually get our food. We eat, we have a great time and the waitress takes the coupon and takes the discount on the cheapest burrito any of us got (rather than a previous GOOD waitress that discounts the $8 burrito). Oh well. :)  We go back to my place, hang out and then go and head to the movies. On the way, we stopped to get snacks at the Hess gas station next to my apartment and I got 2 bottles of soda. 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' Good movie.. kinda weird.. but good. I realized during the movie that the lady at the gas station never gave me my change for the soda.. I gave her a $5 bill and she gave me 12 cents back or whatever. After the movie, Laura heads home and Kerri, Cindy and I head back to my place.  I stop at the Hess, go in and politely explain that I was in a couple hours earlier and that I didn't get the correct change. The lady said that I'd have to wait until 3am to get my change, since that's when they close down the register. I said sure... I'd give her my name and phone and tomorrow I can come back and get my $3. Then she said she remembers clearly.. CLEARLY giving me my change. I told her I didn't get my change, but that I would wait until tomorrow to know for sure. If they are $3 over, then it's my money. If they're not $3 over, then no harm done. She then called me a liar and said I was making a big deal over only $3. I told her that $3 is a big deal to me because its my money and that I would wait until tomorrow, she didn't need to yell at me. It was no big deal. She then said she was a mother of 4 and her entire paycheck goes to bills and only has $20 left at the end of the week, so I shouldn't tell HER about $3. I lied and said I was a college student and $3 was a big deal to me. She then said if I was really a college student, then she'd remember ME. She then said I wasn't welcome at this Hess station ever again (all the while, she was slipping $3 under the window to me). I said thank you and started for the door. She then yelled SEVEN YEARS BUDDY. I turned, walked out the door and she came on the intercom for the building outside and screamed SEVEN YEARS.  Holy good god mother of china..! I got in the car, frazzled (over $3) and we went back to my place. Kerri left, Cindy A. and I hung out, watched raunchy tv and went to bed. I didn't have a good day, as you can see.  Saturday we got up, went to breakfast at Jay's diner after I ran some errands (I mailed my PDA to get it fixed, shopped for some things and went to Dollar General). They had sugarfree syrup, my favorite. Cindy got some french toast (I stole a delicious piece). Laura came over and wrapped up the wedding gift, I got ready and we left to head to Kristen and Wil's wedding around 12:45. After a long two hour drive (and me driving 80) we got there just in time to be seated in the 6th row. Wedding started, lasted forever, and then let out. We waited a long time to throw flowers on Kristen  Will, but it ended up not working out. We got tired of being rained on, so we headed to the country club for the reception.  Found it, went in, and started eating cheeses, drank at the open wine, beer and soda bar (awesome) and awaited the bride  groom. We visited with the people at our table (and secretly hoped that Mr. 7th seat wasn't going to show so Cindy could sit with us with no issues). He never showed! Salads came out, then the main courses. Either beef, chicken or pasta. The waitress was really confused, since nobody at our table ordered beef, but she said 4 people did. Oops. But she finally brought the right food, Cindy had chicken, I had pasta, Laura had beef. We got some Italian cookies, finished our dinners, Laura got tipsey (hehe) and the dancing started.  We danced for a good 4-5 hours. It was so much fun. I sweated like an animal, but it was good fun, plus I felt I was burning off the food I was eating. We left the party around 11 and I drove for 2 hours very tired and with two sleeping people in my vehicle. Finally, I saw Rochester, and we settled into the apartment for a good night's sleep. I think I hit the bed already asleep.  Laura and I woke up and headed to Brueggers for breakfast. Cindy got ready for the day. Today was the last day, Sunday, she was gonna be there so we planned to do a couple fun things. We went to a neat store on Park Ave called Park Leigh (or something), tried to shop on Monroe unsuccessfully, but then headed to Unos in Henrietta for lunch. We had a great meal, Laura and I split a small pizza and I had a salad. Cindy A got some chili and a burger. We took pictures, laughed, caught up on good times, and headed out to the lake for the final 2 hours.  We got up to Charlotte Beach, walked around, walked out on the pier, and then got some ice cream. A weird old hairy guy was skating in a speedo. He kept going past us. Ick. We headed back to my place, Laura went home and I took Cindy (minus Cindy's Michael Moore book) to the airport. I hugged her, told her I'd miss her (I will!) and sent her on her way.  I went back to my messy apartment (I had 3 people over this weekend) and relaxed. I was not looking forward to getting back to the grind at work. :( I got nervous since Cindy wasn't home and it was 9:30. I called Kim with no answer. But Cindy got home at 10pm and Uno was back home too. Cindy and I hung out, talked about our weekends (her weekend was a bit more of a downer) and eventually went to bed around 1 or 2. I think she stayed up though.  A long weekend for sure, but I had a ton of fun with all of my friends. I don't know what I'm going to do without then come September. :(
