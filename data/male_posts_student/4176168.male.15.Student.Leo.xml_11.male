Some happy news today I guess...my English youth pastor got engaged today to one of my friend, really happy for them both...but right after the good news...more responsibilitys, more things need to be completed for the hand book and my GM position...things are going well I guess, since I am on my summer vacation, there is much time to relax and rest. But a bit of work is always needed just to keep me away from brain dead state. ;)...well.....nothing much to add...but I am really enjoying this, hope this will last.
