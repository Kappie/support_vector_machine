Today I had to drive our 17' Boston Whaler through some nasty swell to our dive site.  Considering this is only my second time ever driving this boat on the ocean, and first outside the federal breakwall, I'd say I did okay.  Anywho, the swell was so bad that we couldn't even do the shipwreck mapping dive we were supposed to do.  Instead, we did fish counts near the wreck and just a siteseeing dive on the outer breakwall of LA Harbor.  The breakwall was crazy full of stuff.  Note to Kathy: There are tons of  Corynactis  on the breakwall from about 15 ft to 45 ft.  Catalina is a waste of your effort :)  Okay, less jibber jabber, more stupid crap.  Remember when I said I was going to cut my hair, and then I said I cut my hair after a few adult beverages and used the wrong size clipper guard?     I wasn't kidding.  Back to the cats...  Sam is a loud meowing bastard who needs to be all over you at all times of day.  Don't get me wrong, he's a sweetheart - but he makes you lose a lot of sleep.  So Brazil gets the first picture, since she is fat, but doesn't annoy anyone.    Why is she so fat?  Well, tell me how you can look at her when she begs like that and not feed her.  Plus she's a lazy sack of crap, but she's MY lazy sack of crap.  Okay, Sam's turn:    What a weirdo.  Not sure why he needs to have his belly scratched all the time.     Sam doing what cats do best and most people wish they could do.  Let's call this one a 'candid shot'.     If the last one was candid, I don't even know what you'd call this...  Oh wait, its called 'poop'.  "You haven't dealt with women for a looong time, have you, Sergeant?" - Edna K. "Are you asking me out?" - the REAL Principal Skinner
