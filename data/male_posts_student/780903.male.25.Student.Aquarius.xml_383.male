I'm glad I didn't get too concerned about this or it would have been anti-climactic.  I really want to write a song parody about it.  The moot court program here is called Ames.  So, to the tune of the Backstreet Boys' "Quit Playing Games With My Heart," something like "I'm Losing Ames From The Start."  Look for it tomorrow.  That's all for tonight... going to watch the episode of American Idol I taped and then off to sleep...
