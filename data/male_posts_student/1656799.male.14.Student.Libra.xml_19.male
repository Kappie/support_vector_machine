I need no proof to prove that this proof is by far some of the most horrific and stunningly real proof I've ever given.     Dun dun DUUUUUUUUUUUUN!  Look, a plate, a pile of CD's, biscuits even! Not even 'The Hobbit' escapes the woodenness of the desk! Oh, and a bowl! Can't forget the bowl! With a spoon! Yes, the bowl has a spoon with it! Who would have thought of that? Me? Surely not, for my IQ is lower than that of a braindead goldfish.     I have plenty of paperclippery things. This is useful, for holding things up and stuff . . . I've never used them though, but they're still paperclippery. Don't forget the coppers, I may need them in the case of an emergency, like scraping 23p in one penny coins so that I can get a nice Â£1 coin.     Even Rebecca's sheepy lies in the depths of the desk, and I fished it from behind the Bowl Of Cereal Scrummyness so it can sit upon the Book of Hobbitness.     More sheep, with off-orange glowage action!     Raffle tickets are seen occasionally lying about the desk, however I shall be returning them to the School of Churchfields tomorrow for the grand finale of all raffle draws! Weeeehehehehehe!     One thing on this desk does feel right at home however. As you can see, I do indeed have a pink pile of post-it notes, and a yellow one too but thats not really in the picture. Post-It notes are vital for the survival of a Kevvie, and play a major part in his life. As you can see:        So, I think this proves that my desk is indeed a great big tip of junk, that will sooner or later, need sorting out. Not only has that been proved, but it also proves that I a} have no life, and b) need to get out more.  I thank you and bid you goodnight.
