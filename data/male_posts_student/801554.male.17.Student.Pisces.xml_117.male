Normally I have to wake up at about 5 or 6 on Saturday mornings, in order to catch the bus to go to someplace or another for a scholastic bowl tournament. But not this week! This week I slept untill nine! And then I listened to NPR (Car Talk, for humor value, and Wait! Wait! Don't tell me!) for a while while fiddling around, basically doing nothing. Ah, nothing. I'd forgotten you.  I do, however, have tournaments on the next three saturdays. Arrgh.
