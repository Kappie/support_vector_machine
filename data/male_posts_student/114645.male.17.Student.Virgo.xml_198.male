The funeral went okay, and we also go to attend my dad's aunt Becky, who died in the 70s, daughters wedding. It was cool. She had a great wedding. I took a ton of pictures, so look for those on  urlLink DeviantArt  soon. I dunno what else to say so I am going to go. I might post later tonight, or I will Voice Post tomorrow.
