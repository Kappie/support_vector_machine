The controls are weak, but the creepy noises make it worth it.  I love the idea silent hill had that a radio made a static noise when a monster was close....cause it adds such suspense...you here the static...and you are just waiting for a monster to pop out-BOOM! there it is....creepy as hell....i love that....so...the game is doing good for me....  I am sleeping on the couch tonight cause I started painting my room today! My mom and I got the sand color done...needed two coats....tomorrow we start on the bigger part...the water color...i am going for a beach theme...the sand color is rolling along the bottom ...about a foot and a half off the ground.....then there will be water color....and then use a lighter blue to make waves....it will look really cool....cause i got those water lamps i was talking about before...that have different color lights...it'll be very relaxing...  Well I am gonna wrap this up cause I have something I want to ramble about!  "Don't call me white!" -NOFX
