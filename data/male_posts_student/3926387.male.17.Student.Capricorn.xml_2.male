It brought back some memories, they're getting close to the years when I actually started listening to music *1997-now*. This is embarrasing, but the first English-speaking group I listened to the the Spice Girl x_x. It's still cool to see the stuff that was popular before that, I kinda remember bits of it. Anyways, after that I came online for some drama and random chatter XD.   I went to sleep at 12:30, but in reality actually fell asleep at like, 2 x_x. However, XD, I woke up at 6. It's the anatomical brain clock methinks =). I watched NY1 for half an hour, caught up with the latest local news. Then I switched to C-SPAN , I saw that idiot Bush ramble about how Iraq wasn't a mistake blah blah blah -_-. Really annoying how he still has supporters -_-.  After that I saw some TV, I was like, going to sleep for 2 minutes and waking up 30 seconds later for a whole hour x_x. After that I ate waffles again, not as good as yesterday ._. and then came online and downloaded Namie's new PV!!!!!! ALL FOR YOU is such a great song =) XD!!!!!!! I listened to it like, 5 times in a row XD!!!!! Then I talked to mocchi for a while, and that's it so far. ttyl!  btw, the current soung is Koyote's Si Ryun, douzo.
