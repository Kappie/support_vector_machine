Hitched a ride to plaza singapura before taking the bus to kallang down there. Urgh the sun was so hot and i was super drowxy and tired , my sunburns sustained from thursday made things worse. As ususal my lawn bowling was average, not up to par with dennis the pro and soon to be captain. He usually ends of saving our team when i screw something up. Anyway training ended bout 12 and then i headed home. Supposed to meet my friend but then he suddenly got extra lessons ( acjc). So i just stoned around at home and watched somemore gundam. I really love that show, craving for more episodes   SATURDAY woke up about 10 in the morning.Had to see the eye specialist for a follow up checkup. Went there around 11, even though appointment was at 10. But based on previous experience, i always had to wait, so i thought if i came later= wait less. WRONG! ended up waiting for close to an hour before i spent less than 4 min with the doc. He sayz i am fine just that must come back again in 3 weeks time.  In the afternoon, the same person who i was supposed to meet up again couldnt make it as he was ill. Went home and played the comp for a while, also read the teens magazine i bought. At 430, went with family to funan centre to have an eye checkup and to arrange for my new specs. spent a super long time there as all memebers of my family had to have their eyes checked. My father tried to bargain for a cheaper price, in the end the bill was over 1k dollars.... We had dinner at the foodcourt before leaving around 1940.  Alrite SUNDAY, woke up early around 815, then ate breakfast and my mum sent me to queentown mrt station. Then i went to boon lay station and waited for jing xuan to come. She asked me to come and attend her church service, which is christian, i am a catholic by the way. Well i didnt mind going, wanted to see how a "praise and worship" session was like. So like we boared the shuttlebus, which i stupidly tapped my ezlink card and reached the church which looked super mordern.   WOW ! the moment i stepped in that church ( city harvest) i was impressed, it had lifts and the reception area itself was impressive. The session was held in a auditorum in the basement level 3 and 4. Ok it was huge and the scene was like more for a concert or something. The session kicked off with crowds of pple singing their lungs out and pple jumping for joy praising the lord. I was stunned, this is totally different from the quiet and orderly routine of mass. Here the place was so full of energy and vibrance. The pple are so passionate about singing praises to god. Looking at jing xuan and the other pple singing so deeply and passionately was an eye opener. The music was emplified by some gizmos that are used for concerts. The band played rockish tunes that praised and glorified god.   After that their pastor gave a speech and then invited the guest who was a pastor from Russia who has noble blood. Yeah he was a speaker who roused the attention of everyone, there wasnt a boring moment.He told the pple that i was their duty to go and spread the word's lord and everyone should go for a mission trip or something. Then he asked those who wanted to do something for the lord, and hordes of pple went down, including jing xuan to be blessed by the pastor. A shocking scene for me was went he ran around touching pple's foreheads and they seemingly passed out and fell to the ground. Ok went the service was over, we went to the rooftop for some debriefing. After that i thanked her for this rare insight and she showed me the way back to the bus-stop before i caught 242 back to boonlay station.   Then i took a looooooooooonng trip back to orchard station to meet my classmates for project work. Arrived in town at about 135 and bought some sushi for 510 dollars for my lunch. Talk bout expensive food. The project work meeting around 3 oclock. We shared the delicious fries at the library at orchard. After that i went to meet my family at macs at shaw house basement. Grabbed a quick bite at macs and chatted for a while. Went to borders to kill time. At 1730 went back to lido to watch "breaking news" a chinese movie with my family. Hm pretty short and medicore in my opinion.   After that, i rushed to cineleisure to meet my friend benedict to watch "day after tommorrow" Wow that show was awesome in terms of special effects, the twisters and the snow.Makes me wonder that such an event can actually happen in the future if nothing is done to save the environment. Hm maybe i use less aircon... Finally got home close to 2200 to grab some noodles as dinner.
