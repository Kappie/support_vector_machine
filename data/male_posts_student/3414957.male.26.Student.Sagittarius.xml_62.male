I can't stand this craze of country dudes singing with folk/rock beach sounding singers like Jimmy Buffett. What happend to those great songs about wives leaving their husbands, lost jobs, and trucks breakiung down?????? It's all about the money. Chicks love that beach bum cowboy shit.  I finished my art project, a self-portrait. It's pretty good. It could have been better but I didn't feel like spending all day on it.
