Six hours, a nap, 14 pitchers, and 3 inning-ending double plays hit into by the Yankees' Juan Rivera later, Yankees won 10-9 in 17 innings.  No 300th win for Clemens.  Yankees pitchers threw 246 pitches (Detroit's were ever so slightly more economical at 243), so his arm may have fallen off had they left him in to finish it.  :)
