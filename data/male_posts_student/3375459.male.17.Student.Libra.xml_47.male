If i'm lucky enough, might even meet some cute korean girls. Might even be leaving under the same roof with one. =D.... (drooling) best thing is that all we have to do is stay with them for five days, and they won't have stay with us. Sad to say, i can't make it. its from the 28th June to 4th July... sad man... so its up to my sisters... sigh... time to go.. byez~
