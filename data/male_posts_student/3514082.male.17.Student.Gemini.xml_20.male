Troy was not brilliant it was uter tripe, they turned a fantastic epic myth into a poor story line with bad music and the wooden acting of Orlando Bloom. They fighting scenes were great though, but the whole film went on a bit. Lots of free time up ahead all though I'm gonna make myself busy. I have pleanty lined up with website designs, going canoeing, going to the beach (come along Sam, I'll give you a call), writing scripts, going sailing, attempting the great tidy of My bedroom (maybe that would be a better film than Troy!) and organising various thinmgs and finaly getting to play guitar a bit more. But it'll all have to wait as I'm off to bed soon after a long day. Oh and the week after next my parents are going on holiday so the house will be empty apart from the odd apperance by Tim grunting something about history in the corner. By the way if your ever get the chance read Salam Pax's blog - The Baghdad Blog/Dear Raed as it is called. It is fantastic I just finished reading the book and now I am reading the more recent stuff online at  urlLink  dear_raed.blogspot.com. It's supposed to be crap weather at the weekend so that puts my first oppertunity for sailing of the agenda, great! I was enjoying the heat in our new oversised padling pool.
