But, as Sarah if fond of saying, we work with what we have. There was some awkwardness all around, but I'm glad I got to see her again. I miss her so. We need so much more time... I can't think of what I can't change. But why can't I feel better after seeing her? Why do I have to feel torn every time? And yet I'd sooner kill myself than stop seeing her. I so want to be on amiable terms with her family. That is complicated by her disinclination to have me really meet them, and her parents displeasure over her tardiness today. But I think things can be mended. There isn't much more time. She leaves first week of August, so that's just a couple more I guess. I want to make her happy. I have to make her happy. Otherwize... what's the point? Why have this abortive relationship? When we know it has to end. That it can't continue. Will it have been worth it? Only if I leave her a better person than I find her. If I can show her, and myself, that optimism isn't a flawed philosophy. Oh, God knows, I try.
