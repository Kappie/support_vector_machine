It sucks even more to then play another with only 8 people, the very next day. It sucks even more to play yet another game the next day with god knows how few people.  Apathy sucks.         Chilling is with friends is fun. Being alone sucks.  Playing soccer is fun. Being massacred sucks.  Having ideas as to what to do to releive bordom is fun. Being bored sucks.  Being with Kathrin is fun. Being alone....just sucks.
