The strange is that is not for a job, but for my research project, so I'm gonna go there and ask questions to them.. hope it goes fine! Tomorrow I'll be going to Switzerland and do the same with Rothshild, another huge Swiss Bank.  By the way, I'm backin Milan and it's 35 degress (maybe 9387 F) and awfully humid, guess what! I don't have air conditioner here... I'm melting.  I see Adam is just working and Ulli is busy with a bunch of cheeks... have fun! Bye bye Bea
