But today, after school, I found this cool site, so I had to repost on this site since it was so much better. Well, here it is: The First Post. Enjoy.  Well, today as slightly boring. No, I take it back. It was more than slightly boring - it was intensely boring. My science teacher, who is a bitch, was a bitch today. But I did get to see my friends. Oh yes, my friends. Let me introduce them to you. There is L.D. -- the obnoxious, perverted guy with jet black hair and glasses. He raises chickens and has gone to school with me since Kindegraten. And he is extremely annoying to the point of where you want to punch him in the face. But he's my friend anyway. Then there is Hugo. Hugo came to our school in seventh grade. I was the first one in the class to befriend him, then he met L.D. and then during ninth grade, they were best friends without me. That pissed me off, but Hugo isn't as good friends with L.D. as they were. That's probably because Mac is now in High School with us. Mac and L.D. are really good friends, considering the fact that they've been friends since they could talk I guess. I'm not too knowledgeable in the history of Mac, but I do know that in elementary school he was my best friend, until he was homeschooled, then he came back two years later: in a lower class than me. Anyway, we are all friends now. And then there is the guy that is friends with Mac and L.D., so I guess that qualifies him as my friend too, right? Eh, who cares. Anyway, Nathan is like a mixture of the funniest man in the world, with the most obnoxious man in the world. If you mix them, you get Nathan. Need I say more? Then there is Mac's ex-girlfriend: Kayci. Kayci rides horses and she is hilarious. I guess that's why I'm friends with her: because she shares the same sense of humor as me. But Brandi and Violet do too. Violet is afraid of dogs, and kinda weird, but funny. And Brandi is the 'good-girl' of the bunch. She's funny too. Last year, I asked her out and she said no. This year, she asked me out. I said no. We are both idiots. I have a feeling that we will be going out before too long. I still like her, and she still likes me. We both know that, and we don't try to hide it. Right now: we're friends that flirt...a lot...a real lot. Everybody always asks if we are going out, and we always say, "I dunno." or "Maybe." or "I guess." We are, I guess, even though we don't even know it. Anyway, there is the somewhat manly Sondra aswell. But Kayci and her hate eachother. They used to be best friends in Jr. High. Then they got into the biggest fight over the stupidest thing. Now they hate eachother. But I'm still friends with her. Oh ya, I'm a sophomore in High School, and so is L.D. and Hugo. Mac, Kayci, Nathan, Brandi, Violet, and Sondra are Freshmen. The school year is almost over [YAH!] and so I will soon be a Junior, and they will be Sophomores. Anyway, today is Wednesday, May 19th, 2004. It is nearly 6 in the afternoon, and as far as I know, all of my friends our at our town's current favorite hangout place. A little restaurant on the corner of Main Street. I didn't feel like going. I HAD TO TYPE THIS! No, that's not really why. Kayci, Brandi, AND Violet are all there...at once. That is not good because this week, Violet and Brandi are fighting with Kayci. A couple weeks ago, me and Brandi were fighting with Kayci. Next week, though, it will be someone completely different. But we all try to just get along. TRY being the key-word. OH YEAH! I forgot to mention another guy in my class. He is Kayci's 'soon-to-be-boyfriend'. His name is Younger. He is kinda shy, but he is cool. Definitely the outdoors type. But Kayci is too. Well, I'm about to go to Wednesday Night Church. So, until the next update, which will hopefully be tomorrow and not as long, LATER!
