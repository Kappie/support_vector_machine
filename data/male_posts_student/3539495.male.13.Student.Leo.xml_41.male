Wave pools are the best! You feel like you get drowned, then you come up, then you go down, then the lifeguard yells at you, repeat until you get kicked out (happened to me once). Speaking of lifeguards, i had a conversation with one. This was basically how it went:  Me: Hey Mr. Lifeguard, thanks for guarding over... Him: We're not opening the pool for another fifteen minutes dippy.  Today i figured out how to rip Velvet Revolvers "Contraband" CD. Its copyprotected, so Im really proud of doing it on the first try. Take that SunnComm! Muahahaha no one can stop pirates!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
