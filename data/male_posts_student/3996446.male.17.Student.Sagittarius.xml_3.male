Actually I shoulda said I talked to Crystal for a few hours before my "fun". Its always great to hear from her and even if i'm in the worst of moods she always seems to get me to smile or at least cheer up a little. Amy's b-day was yesterday. So if you ever see this Amy, Happy Birthday. It kinda came up in the phone call I was having with Crystal. What's wrong with me. I'm still not over any of them. I just lost Lauren and that hurts like hell. I still feel something towards Markita, not very strong feelings but somethings still there. And everytime Amy's brought up, my heart drops a little. Damn. I've got to get over her. A few days ago I got into a huge arguement with my parents, and given that my father and I don't much get along, and how angry and somewhat depressed I was, I ended up punching a solid concrete slab outside of our house. The first time it kinda hurt but the next ten or twenty I didn't feel much until I heard a crack and a loud "pop". Now my freakin right hand is swollen to an insane size, I personally have only seen a bigger hand on a Gorilla at the zoo. My left is the one that went "pop" its knuckles are only slightly red. And the crack came from the concrete breaking. Not cool. I'm gonna get in trouble for that, just a matter of time. I got ROTC in a few days so i'm sorta nervous about that. I'm gonna be an Officer. Wow. More responsibility in my already busy life. LOL! Yea right. Ahh.... maybe ROTC will keep me to busy to continue my "love life". I'll be on like three teams and still have all those stupid senior duties, and also focus on graduating. I'm freakin hungry. Lets go eat.
