You are  very  close to being kicked off the team,  Post or be removed,  comprende?     As for the links Jamie put up, here's a quote:       "We caution people not to write about bombs because if they're going on vacation, their travel plans will be disrupted,"     lol ^^    Still not an awful lot happening the country North of the US of A,  Cousin still as fat, cute, disturbing as ever...  I'm still as skinny as ever...  and as bored...  *sigh*  I give up,  I WANT TO GO HOME!!!!!!!  There...  nope...  Still bored...  :/  I shall leave you with a bad pun... not sure if its worse than my usual ones, but still:  "What do you want to be? A big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond?" "A mediocre beaver in a stream!" "???" "Then I could do any  DAM  thing I want!"  -_-;;  Before you start throwing things folks,  I didn't make it up!   Blame   urlLink  Able and Baker     Meh...
