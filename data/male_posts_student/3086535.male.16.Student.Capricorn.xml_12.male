I don't know who is looking at this. You could be crazy for all I know, but I say it knowing I will never meet you, I will never have to face you, whoever you are. So I can happily say I love you without meaning it, but you won't know I don't mean it. Is that mean? I guess it is. I'm a mean guy. You know who is meaner than me? Nicole. If you don't know Nicole you should. I made a website for her(against her permission) It's called http://www.geocities.com/nicolesthecenteroftheuniverse/ She really is the center of the Universe. That website is no good though, I've given it to a friend and he's made it all screwy, so if you see something stupid on there, it was Bill and Chris, not me. If you don't know what I'm talking about, good, you shouldn't. That is a personal joke between friends. Anyway, I'm tired of typing, my wrists hurt.
