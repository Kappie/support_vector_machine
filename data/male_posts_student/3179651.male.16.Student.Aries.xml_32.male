Jesus Fucking Christ if i'm in the comp room with the door closed, it probably means i don't want you coming in here disrupting shit... But whatever, they are Family. Since grandma found out i can't sleep she has tips for keeping my energy up and sleeping, which include lettuce sandwiches and coffee. News flash. Nyquill knocks me out, coffee keeps me up...  I'm setting up an image gallery. Yeah, its gonna be badass once i get eveything done. Once they update everything will run much better as well.
