The two large political parties have started to pick up fights on every issue imaginable. They are employing muscle power to cling on to their positions and also for making illegal money. Because of weak governance, terrorists and muslim extremists have become very brave and now are comducting their operations openly (in many areas with the help of the police themselves!!!) Police have become so corrupted and the politicians have become so dependent on terrorists to hang on to power that the whole law and order situation has become a matter of joke to the general people. Before, the terrorists used to lie low but see what has transpired recently, they tried to and almost succeeded to kill the British High-Commissioner in Bangladesh. What a country and what a time we live in! The country is run by illiterate and politically blind people, who have become Godfathers( Mario Puzo huh!) themselves. The chief advisor of prime minister returns home after a shameful defeat and facing the onslaught of critisisms from the opposition leader, he says the most disgusting and ugly things about her in front of national press. Even an illiterate rickshaw-puller would be ashamed to say such things about a lady in front of a press, no matter how much offended he may be. That's all. I see no hope for this country at this point. "The RAZAKARS", who cospired and killed many people of our country and served the Pak army in 1971, are becoming important players in politics( in fact they have ministers in the govt. he he he). That's all from me for today. bye.
