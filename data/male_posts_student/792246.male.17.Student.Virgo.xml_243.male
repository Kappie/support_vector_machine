Well, today I went to my first class, English, expecting to see my dear friends Brad and Megan. Both of whom, were not there.  After that, I went to Middle East(which I probably should drop...hmm), and discovered my two dear friends in that class, Ryan and Brittny, were not there.  After contemplating the possibility that everyone was throwing me a surprise birthday party six months in advance, I came to the obvious solution that people who know me are getting killed.  Beware.
