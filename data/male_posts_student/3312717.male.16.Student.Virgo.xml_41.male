Every pointless hour I spend in Chemistry and FST is spent counting off the hours of them I have left. But I think I'll feel bad about school ending. School to summer is such an abrupt shift, and I find that I spend all of June just trying to figure out what to do with my spare time. My favorite part of summer are the hours I keep. I basically stay up until 3 or 4 am, and then sleep until 1-3 pm. It is the most relaxing thing you could ever do. To me, getting up before noon in the summer is the worst sort of blasphemy.    The last obstacle that looms before me is the Gatsby essay. I have no idea where to start, and I think I am going to get a crappy grade on it. I get a crappy grade on it, chances are most people will do horrible.   Tay is the biggest psuedoliberal ever, I've decided. Mr. Wanninger said that I couldn't technically call him a psuedoliberal because he is a far-right Democrat. Seriously, I'm going to make a "Not my friend" T-Shirt. I was going to make a bunch, but I don't really wanna hop on the "hate Tay" bandwagon, even though he is a jackass. He's not the only one though. I dislike people who hate Bush just because they think it is cool. Fact of the matter is, it isn't about GW. It is about a battle for the hearts and the minds of the American people between progressive and regressive. Not conservative and liberal, progressive and regressive. You won't impress me by hating George Bush.    Regardless of the above paragraph, I still dislike most conservatives. I know that right-wingers like Rush and John Ashcroft aren't really representative of the whole right, but you almost never meet moderate conservatives like Houley. It's always crazy facists like Schilling or people who decide that their religion allows them to always have the moral high ground. Well, I guess Schilling counts in that group too. Schilling is alright though. I enjoy listening to his crazy rhetoric. I can't figure out why some people are conservatives, like Hannah. We haven't talked about politics much, though when we working on the Iraq package she assured me she was a "flaming Republican." Maybe it's just the way her and the Hobster were raised..... I'm glad I escaped the stigma of conservatism, even though almost all of my extended family think I'm a crazy liberal, with the exception of my oh-so-understanding grandma....    What is up with kids and music today? I mean, you either listen to mainstream music, or you try and grab as much indie cred as possible and listen to stuff so esoteric that no one understands.  When I hear kids in my classes listening to hardcore rap I just want to walk over to them and shout, "You are an upper-class white kid, moron! You have no idea what these guys are talking about!" I confess I often prejudge kids based on the music they listen to. If someone listens to industrial, nu- or black metal, or any other sorts of "heavy" music, I have a hard time taking them seriously. If you listen to rap, chances are you stereotype and glamourize life on the streets. If you listen to emo, well, you suck. I can't really put it any other way. I dislike emo more than any other kind of music. It is such an insincere, bland, indifferent form of music that I don't know why kids listen to it.    Indie weirds me out. I enjoy to listen to it, but only as an observer. I can't feel any force or energy, positive or negative, behind it.    I guess I have been generalizing indie. Let me ameliorate that to "stuff that is on Hobie's computer weirds me out." There.   But my number one music pet peeve in the universe is pop-punks. I don't hate them with the fervor of the Oselands, and I don't fall over myself trying to prove my punkness, but they annoy the hell out of me. Some kids at my school think that slapping on a NOFX or Casualties shirt makes them punk. It doesn't. I plan on going into a "What is punk?" type deal some other day. But let me say this: I don't care if you're in the Casualties army. I don't care if you have a mohawk. Any jackass with clippers (as me and Chris proved) can get one. Punk is challenging the common tenets and beliefs of society. Anyone can be a punk, but you are not.    But enough ranting. This weekend, derive enjoyment from music. Don't just listen to music, feel it. And remember, no matter how bad your music tastes are, I won't make fun you. (At least not to your face.)   I'm dreading and looking forward to the end of school.
