To catch newcomers up to date – I used this company for a move last year Chicago area to Charleston, WV and it went FABULOUS – everything professional, organized, and promptly and courteously  handled no matter what came up. This year, I hired them for my move from Charleston to the suburbs of Kansas City. If there could be a larger difference than 180 degrees I would endorse it. From the start it had a bit of a different feel, but the salesman was reassuring that Graebel was a standardized company. From earlier messages, I indicated a bit of a “hard core press” from the salesmen in the Kentucky office, but he answered all of my questions and, again, since the last move was handled so well, I felt confident. Graebel has no office in WV, and on the internet if shows up as services by Pennsylvania or Virginia. I even called the Kansas office to inquire estimates for loads coming back west, but the salesmen from Kentucky said his office “must arrange it, as Charleston is in their area” and he even called the KC office back to cancel my inquiry. I did not get a binding estimate, as I basically had the same stuff I had the year before – both the company and I had all the former paperwork so I felt comfortable. We did paperwork by fax, and I thought all was set.   My moving coordinator was supposed to contact me, but I had to call them to check on things (compare to Chicago move, where I received a welcome letter clearly outlining all the upcoming steps within days). They sent someone out to do an estimate anyway (fine....but they seemed confused that I had paperwork already done....and showed up 3 hours earlier than the appointment time as I was on the way to take my parents back to the airport!). The gentleman that did my estimate was actually one of the two guys who had helped my driver unload me the year before, he was very nice and told me he’d likely be helping this time as well. He apologized for the office mix-up on my paperwork/arrangements with the estimate. I called the salesmen to inquire about the estimate and any changes as a result, and he said an in-home estimate wasn’t needed, that was a mistake but no problem, they just had some “miscommunication in the office.” (TIP OF THE ICEBERG).  I still have not heard from the company 5 days before my load date, I call to make sure it is on the books – it is. My moving coordinator calls 2 days before load date to see if I’m  all set (I self pack everything). Yes, I am, and before she hangs up on me I ask her about my driver name/number. She looks it up. (BTW – this is NOT the name of the guy who shows up Saturday, and is again in contrast to my Chicago move, where the driver contacted me several days before and introduced himself, checked in with me, exchanged info, etc.).  So Saturday June 26 arrives. I and my children have been up a good portion of the night ensuring everything is absolutely ready, and we are waiting by the 7:30-8a.m. Time slot. The driver shows up around 9:15. He is from the Houston office. I inquire about helpers, he says two guys are supposed to be there from the Kentucky office. I call my coordinator and he calls his office. Meanwhile, I live in an urban area near where indigent and addicted people hang out. A moving truck attracts this population (sorry, I am being non-PC here, but it is well known in my neighborhood that these are not people to have around your stuff). So I am waiting amidst calls of “hey girlie, need some help moving? I’ll move stuff for some cash.” etc. etc. I say thanks anyway, but I have hired a company, so please give us some room.  The moving coordinator “doesn’t know what happened, 2 guys where supposed to show up and sometimes this happens”. The driver is blaming the Kentucky office, the Kentucky office is blaming the Houston office. Meanwhile, my driver is loading what he can by himself onto the truck. He wants to hire some of the street people and I say no – that is not what I hired the company for. (Graebel strongly states that they have stringent training and only use professionals on all aspects. The year before, I had a new employee, and he was required to be supervised more closely and my driver informed me he was new, etc.). My move coordinator agreed, and told me to not have the driver hire street help. They were supposedly contacting other companies in the area to get help sent out and hopefully loaded that day. Of note, my coordinator kept saying “I’ll call you right back” but hours would pass, and I finally called HER every time.  I went at 1:00 p.m. To pick up food for my driver. When I returned, he had hired one of the street men, who was in my house jerking down the stairs my boxes of belongings on a dolly (none of the fancy “move 2-3 boxes on your back” moves that I’ve always been in awe of every time I’ve hired professional movers). The driver shrugged and said “I had no choice but to hire someone like that, just keep an eye on your stuff.” The moving coordinator then says she will be leaving at 3:00 P.M, but I should feel free to use the “emergency hotline.”  I was of course by this time very unpleased. She said she totally agreed and confessed that in 20+ years of working in the industry she didn’t know what to do about this move. She advised me that my children and I could help load the truck ourselves, and that they could “pay me”.  I informed her that, given we’d been up with moving activities and the end of school, and had a 14 drive ahead of us, and HIRED movers, this was unacceptable. She agreed and endorsed that she would “advocate for whatever I wanted” and asked me what that would be. I told her I was at a loss, because this was obviously not my area. When I asked her what she recommended she said I should ask for a bigger discount for sure, and reimbursement of anything broken even in those boxes would be reasonable given that my move “broke all the conventions they had guidelines for.” She also reassured me she “sat next to the regional vice president and they would make it right.”  The driver was unfriendly – never said thank you from the food and drinks to the substantial tip as the end. I KNOW this was not his fault, and was not about to take it out on him. I also told the move coordinator that any compensation needed to come from the company and not from the driver’s pay, who was also put in a terrible position. She agreed. I certainly would be in a bad mood in the drivers’ position, but he was a bit extreme. Several times he complained about my furniture (some of it IKEA-type – hey! I’ve been a grad student single parent!) A few pieces – which had been moved with no problems or comments before – he said he’d refuse to move unless I signed a waiver. I told him I had never had to do that before. Some other pieces he started breaking down which had not been taken apart on any previous moves. One he insisted I break it down or he wouldn’t take it. I refused and called the hotline. They kept emphasizing “your driver is a professional” [so not the point) and that it is “driver’s discretion to move pressed wood” (then shouldn’t they send me a driver more comfortable with my furniture type – again this had never come up in past moves). After the hotline call it was not mentioned again, and the driver loaded it. Turns out – he told me that “there might not me enough room in the truck!” This was the big emphasis on breaking things down, besides ease of carrying things with the aid of an untrained helper. I was extremely upset – why send a truck that can’t even fit my things???????  This move took TWELVE hours to load 7500 lbs (my last move took 5). We could not clean out apartment and have the walkthrough that day, and obviously could not leave for KS anyway until the next day as we were so warn out from the dragged out stressful process.  The KS end unload on Tuesday the 29th went better, although there was only 1 helper (thankfully a Graebel employee, though) and it still took longer than my last super-efficient move. I had to sign the paperwork before it was weighed because he hadn’t gotten light weight. My move coordinator said she had to put my charge through since they did it COD, but that she would meet with everyone about my situation. My salesman was out on vacation until the next day.  Over a week passes with no word (contrast last year, both driver, coordinator, and national rep checked in with me after the move). I finally leave moving coordinator a voicemail yesterday. She calls me today, saying they had a “long meeting” with my salesman and the regional VP out of Cincinnati. All they are willing to do is send me a check for $150 since “They did what they said they’d do and got me loaded on that day and I didn’t help with any labor. The coordinater told them she didn’t think I’d be satisfied with that, and they said that’s all they were willing to do. She told me she strongly disagreed with the deccison but “had no power.” She suggested I write to the salemean and the VP and gave me the address.  So essentially – I could have paid a couple hundred to the street people to load a U-Pack thing in Charleston, and had relatives in KS unload me (I DO know people on this end to help). Instead, I’ve paid over $3,000 for the most rude, inefficient, stressful, and unprofessional experience of my life.   Here’s some laughable quotes from their booklet:  “When you put most of your worldly possessions in the hands of a mover, it’s nice to know they 'know how and care’. Graebel has the experience and the commitment to live up to every guarantee. We make lots of friends this way.”  “A team of talented people. - Thousands of dedicated Graebel colleagues join in the pursuit of excellence. Stringent recruitment standards, regular training and constant supervision assure your satisfaction. Greabels’ results-oriented professionals are nationally recognized for pioneering a new kind of competence. We’ve made moving the organized, effortless experience it should have been all along.”  You know – I was a VERY happy customer last year, and I’m not that hard to please. Just a couple of those “thousands” of dedicated employees is all I wanted to show up for my move. I do not feel I got that, and know of no other business where such inadequacy in customer satisfaction is dismissed or forgiven.   So all in all it sucked. Worst move I've ever been through, and probably will ever go through. So now you know the story of how my stuff got to Kansas. I've already covered the drive in an phone post, so I'll be back later to share everything I've done since arriving here in fabulous Kansas.
