       
      This afternoon, as I closed my book upon completing the final BarBri review lecture, an incredible thought occurred to me.  I have finished attending law school classes.  Because I will attend PMBR's MBE review on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of next week, I will miss the last three school days of the quarter.  This quarter is my last.  I have no classes tomorrow.  Without realizing it, I completed my law school career at 2:03 pm today in Professor Whitaker's Securities Regulation class.  Today was my last day as a student in a classroom.  After attending law school for twelve quarters over three years... after taking the maximum allowed course load every quarter... after completing all six concentrations... after seven-and-a-half uninterrupted quarters on law review... after a year of Student Bar Association work... after clerking for Professors Guinn and Powell... after six Moot Court competitions... after Practice Court...  ... it all ended today.  I have capstone work left to finish.  I need a few more hours at the DA's office (Criminal Practice), I have a research paper and a will to draft (Estate Planning), and after graduation I have nonprofit bylaws to draft (Business Transactions.)  Of course, one more round of exams looms in the distance.  Yet none of these tasks seem quite so daunting now.  More than 170 quarter hours of classes are behind me.  The Texas Bar Exam stands as guardian between my student life and my graduation ceremony.  College friends will arrive from Cambridge, New York, and San Francisco.  My parents will drive down from Plano.  I will walk across a stage and into my new life.  The excitement and anticipation of that moment propel me through this hellish month.  I intend to become a financial planner.  I will sit for Certified Financial Planner (CFP) exam in November, the Certified Financial Analyst (CFA) Level I exam in December, and the Series 7 (broker) test in early January.  Considering the self-study in my near future, perhaps the finality I appreciate this evening is an illusion.  Life is always a balance between learning and doing.  Today, though, marks the end of twenty years of formal schooling (kindergarten, grades 1-12, four years at Yale, and three years at law school.)  The future beckons.  But now is not a time for reflection.  The greatest battle awaits me at the end of the month.  One beast remains for me to slay.  After two months of fear and trembling, I face that Bar Exam with an intensity I have not had until this moment.  Off I go to study.   I prepare for the coming battle.
