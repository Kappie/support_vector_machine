Chances are I'll post these stories as I'm writing them which means they'll be out of order (I write scenes I like down in a writer's journal; most of the time the scenes won't be in order. I just write whenever an idea for the story pops into my head).  ----- ( Working title - Red Dress )  .Prologue 	It was pitch black outside, but looking at my watch I could tell it was only 6:00 PM. School had ended only three hours ago; about the time the storm had began to pull in. It had come in quickly, and it darkened the sky to the point of night. Why was I out? I'm wasn't sure myself. I guess it was fate. If all things really do happen for a reason, then my story is a fine example. 	There I stood: on top of a milk carton and peering into the old, dilapidated house. It was hard to see inside the living quarters, but I stood there, hoping I would get a glance of the inside of the haunted crevice, and prove myself to everybody. 	Rain fell from the dark sky, but I had no luck. There was nothing in the window except for me. I saw only my reflection. I saw my dark brown hair that hung over my sea-green eyes. I couldn't have been any more than seven-years-old. I continued trying to see something in the dark abyss. I was so close that I could see my short breaths on the window.  	All I remember is the blinding white flash murdering the darkness. I remember the chunks of dirt that flew up from the ground and hit me in the eye, but what I remember most of all before I collapsed onto the muddy earth, was the old, still, pale woman lying in the inside of the house, in the middle of a blue and brown tile floor with a sea of red surrounding her.  .Unknown 	"I'm just not some kind of experiment!" She threw her aims up and down in a violent rage. A flowerpot flew through the dark house and smashed against a wall somewhere. It was too dark to see where the flowerpot pieces fell to. "This is my life! You just can't put me into an experiment, and expect me not to feel. TO FEEL!" Another item in her hand shot across the darkness. "I killed him. I had nothing left." Her voice was calm now. "Do you know what love is?" She had acknoleged my presence for the first time. 	"No, but I do know it exists."  	"How?" Her voice echoed through the house. She was once again in screaming. "All love is," she paused, "is a justification." She was quiet again Her eyes stopped sparkling. I thought the end had finally come. "Do you know what that means?" 	I tried to respond, but I had taken too long. She jumped from the chair and started again. 	"The word... it's just an excuse. Nobody feels it. Let me put it into a more simple terms. Have you ever read Romeo and Juliet?" She didn't stop for me to answer. "Tybalt's death was inevitable. He had to die. He had no justification to kill Mercutio. Romeo slaughtered him." 	"He was sen-" I was cut off again. 	"Exile. Exile isn't death. Why did he kill Tybalt? One might say because of his love for his friend. That's not the true reason. It's the same reason he tresspassed on the Capulet's blacony. BECAUSE HE COULD! HE HAD LOVE! That's all that mattered to him in his mind. People don't need anything to live with except feeling like they did the right thing. He only died because he thought Juliet died. His justification vanished." 	I stood there. I wodnered how someone could actually think this. I wondered if she knew about the her victim's descendents wanting to find an answer about their father's death.
