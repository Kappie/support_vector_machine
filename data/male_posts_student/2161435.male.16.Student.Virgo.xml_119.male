It was amazing! if you ever get the chance to see him, do it! he is a legend! I am all happy, and it's all good. The intervals were a bit short though, which meant I had to down the best part of half a pint of Vodka and red bull. As Olly put it: "There's a straight line down there, and you're avoiding it at all costs."  I'm not lightweight though, no no no! Bri-y is, but that's not my problem. It was great, anyway. We stood up and clapped lots! He did high and dry, which was the most F**cking incredible thing ever. He had the whole crowd singing in three part harmony, and it sounded incredible! He kept running out ad touching a bit of carpet too, which was mental. he is a legend. I want to have his children. Yes Vicky, that means Dave is safe from me, at least for now... but as or the future, who knows? Anyway, enough of this kinda gay thing, but Jamie Cullum is a legnd. Yay! Yay! Yay! It was sooo good. And I met up with Carly, who, by pure coincidence was at the same bit of the bar as we were. Did you enjoy it CArlos? I thought it was f**cking incredible, which you may have guessed by now. Then we came back and watched the best bits of Glasto. If anyone saw Franz Ferdinand, I WANT HIS SHIRT!
