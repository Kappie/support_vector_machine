I got so frustrated that I started yelling at the phone. Another project!   If the government really wants us to learn Morals, then they should seriously implement subjects like Literature in English into the school syllabus. Moral is just plainly, a stupid subject. It is impossible for someone to learn the definition of "Compassion", be shown what compassion is, and with a snap, become a compassionate person. It just doesn't work that way, but the education system  expects  its students to be like zombies. I don't know if it’s the same around the world, but in Malaysia, sometimes I feel like the system is trying to get me to lose my identity and individualism.    If they taught us Moral values through Literature however, it would be an entirely different case. Students will be given the task of thinking for themselves. There will also be a higher chance of students actually absorbing some Moral values too, as good literature gives its reader an almost first-hand experience in a situation.   The Chinese Rice Dumpling Festival has begun. The special Rice Dumpling Festival is celebrated by the Chinese in memory of a great Chinese poet/scholar who snuffed himself a few centuries ago.   The rice dumplings are wrapped in bamboo leaves and steamed till' the pork fat in the glutinous rice melts. The dumplings are normally stuffed with huge morsels of fat pork, oysters, shrimps and salted eggs. There are other various types of dumplings too, some of which are plain but are eaten with  kaya  (a thick, delicious jam made from coconut flesh).   And in follow-up to yesterday's journal entry, I want to note that in my opinion, the situation of Kim Sun-Il, the Korean captive in Iraq who is currently fearing for his life, is a problem of moral and rational action. By giving in to the terrorist’s demands and pulling the troops out of Iraq, an innocent life will be saved. However, by turning a cheek, one more head will be lost but other benefits will follow.   It's a Catch-22 situation. I wish Kim Sun-Il the best of luck, and to mankind; the universal sign: _1_    I'm beginning to fear this world, to fear the very people that I see on the streets. Sometimes, I even fear my own thoughts.
