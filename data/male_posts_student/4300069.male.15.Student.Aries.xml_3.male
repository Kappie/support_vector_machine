I am numb and unconnected, in this world I am consumed with hate and sin. Looked upon with wonder, yet no one understands, that the darkness within me, is darker than the devil within.  It's the darkest hour, when the sands of time stand still. It's the darkest hour, when the devils come out to kill. It's the darkest hour, when the sands of time stand still. It's the darkest hour, when everyone's filled with fear.  When the darkness comes I show my pain, the devils come and take me away. If you take a look around, this world is filled with hate and shame.  Chorus 2x
