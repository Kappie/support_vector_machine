I am looking forward to moving. I am also saddened about moving. A man of two boats really. Thats nice analogy work. I thought it was. Again who cares about you. 'Cept me; obviously. I love all. Orange and skunk alike.   Don't think I did too badly at my exams today. Hope I didn't. Who wants to do bad though I guess. Not me. Not many. English was rather good. It was the type of writing I like which was enjoyful much.  After tomoroow I have a week off, for lazing around. That should be fun. Might see if Adam is free a lunch time or two. I hope he is. Like simon, he is one of my bestest friends.   Till a later date when I have word upon which to say. Foundations for a conversation with myself. Bye.
