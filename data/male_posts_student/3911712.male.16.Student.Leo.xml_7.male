I'm new to this hole "blog" thing but I'll do my best to make a fun log for ya'll to read. I don't really have anything to complane about at the moment so I'll tell you all a little about myself.  My name is undisclosed, my friends call me JP. I live in norway, I was born 28'th of July, 1988. I have a very cute and funny girlfriend who has a very special place in my heart, she probably wont read this blog though.. shame really 'cause I'll prolly say a lot of positive things about her in it. I like metal, and almost all the sub-genres. I like a lot of diffrent animals (not a fan of horses though, unless theyr steeds!), I have a dog and a cat, the cat just had kittens but we've given them all away (so sad, I grew ever so attached to them.. well not really but they where fun to play with ^_^). I have a brother, and both my parents, we all live together (one big happy fammily, woop de-do..). I like reading (well, depends on the book, of course), being in scout (yes, I know, geeky, never the less quite social and you get to do a lot of fun stuff), computers, and making shitty wannabie pieces of art (check them out at Jaypea.deviantart.com). Now i could yap on and on about my dislikes but theres just too much to yap on about! However, I will tell you all now, I  HATE , well, nothing ^_^, I just dislike a lot of stuff that's all, however, if I start hating something you'll all be the last to know ^_^)  anyway, if you have any questions about me, ask, I'll prolly answer 'em as best I can.
