I hope you get bored reading this journal. It's not really written for you, just for self support, kind of... Some machine is reading this and saying "This guy's smoking something." and I say "Stupid machine, must've been that pot this afternoon." Haha, see?  I don't smoke, though. I watched the season finale of 7th heaven, and the only good part was when Matt decided that divorce wasn't a good way, and Kevin fainted because he realized that Lucy didn't WANT to have a baby, but was already pregnant(and he fainted(He's a cop, so it's funny like that))  I've read other people's journals, and they mention stuff about philosophy and classes  and other things that they do. I don't. Like I said before... "Get used to it." It's gonna be a long and boring way through.  I hung out with one of my neighbors today. We set up a theme park kind of ride, that was really fun, on the new swingset that my Dad and I worked on. That was our most recent home improvement project.   People owe me a ton of money for mowing more than an acre BY FREAKING HAND. I did it all with a push mower ( XD )I'm getting impatient, but don't worry.  I won't kill you... Yet.   About that swing formation we set up. It was really fun because we went 200 degrees to about 230 degrees of the rotation(almost all the way around). He eventually fell off, and made a movielike *THUD*. It was really cool. So... I asked him if he wanted to do it again so I can record the effect for one of my movie-like creations.   After we got hurt with a piece of tree, two rings, and a swing, we decided to practice for our upcoming movie production in the summer, when my cousin comes.  He likes to make cool movies with our camera. It's kind of fun, until somebody gets hurt(then it's hilarious   This is probably the longest journal entry I'll ever post... I think. School was incredibly boring today. I got another of my 8 grade exam practice packets finished. I'm thankful that I finally got that done, because I was a little bit behind.  After school, I had jazz band. My director said we sounded pretty good. I'm the only half-decent one in the low brass, because all the other players are trombone 6th graders, and they can't play for crap, not that they would want some... I think.  I played louder than normal trying to conduct them in playing properly.  And now that I've been writing this post for so long, it seems like the words are rearranging themselves into swear words because I'm not really paying attention to what I'm typing. It's a wierd feeling. a;dosfi;aodshifa;oshf. Lol, random outburst *blinks*  Wierd... The casserole my mom made today wasn't bad. I leveled up in Neoquest II, preparing for Hubrid Nox, which I died on... I got him down to half his HP, because he kept healing.   We're swimming in P.E., which I really don't want to call "P.E", because it's tacky. (I'm kind of going backwards) I sat next to a girl named Nicole, who scares me because she has random outbursts of strange experiences she's had. This morning she told me that "When I got home from AppleBee's it looked like my mom's care got a hair cut"... I don't know why she says that stuff. After a long discussion about the origin and planning of the Erie Canal in Social Studies, we said that the construction began in Rome. And she had the brilliant idea, that it was not ROME, NEW YORK, where the Erie Canal is, and everybody thinks that she might believe it's Rome, Italy. But no... She thought it was Rome, Paris. Rofl. Dang, she's funny.  When I woke up this morning I felt strange and unhappily tired, because my brother's alarm clock rang before mine did. It's not fair. I like my stuff to have priority...  I should go soon, because my mom's complaining about my constant AWESOME typing. Not to mention that's so awesome because I'm veru neat and have good error spotting. ;P  *sighs* I don't want to change in a locker room with naked people. It scares me... That's kinda sick, though... Remind me to pack my bathing suit.
