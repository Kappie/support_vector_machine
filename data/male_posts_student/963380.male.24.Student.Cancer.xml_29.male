Video Game Films that haven't been so bad (Aka the Short List) Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within It had the great Donald Sutherland - father of Keifer and the guy who made lisps acceptable everywhere. A Baldwin Brother bites it, sadly so does Steve Buscemi, Mr. Rhames and Roz from Fraser. Hell - it's got James Woods. You could have him read the phone book and I'd pay to see it. In Swahili.  Video Game Films that blow more than your average Saigon Whore Double Dragon It had Robert "Liquid *fucking* Metal" Patrick and still managed to suck.  Mortal Kombat/Annhiliation Christopher Lambert, how you've fallen, there should have only been one. Didn't I see these films the first time round as Enter the Dragon?  Wing Commander I dig Matthew Lillard - great as Shaggy. In this hunk of tripe though, good god. Why didn't we have Mark Hamill, John Rhy-Davies and Malcolm McDowell... they were great in the game (GCV - Grainy Choppy Video!! First game on DVD!!)  Street Fighter Most criminal thing about this wad of shit - it was Raul Julia's last flick.  The Pokemon Movies - Let's not go there, shall we?  Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever I think Antonio Bendaras is a great guy, who's done some decent work. I think Lucy Lui is a bit of a putz. This film is a suckage great than either could generate on their worst day.  It's all about the numbers. These flicks just don't have the forces of good on their side.
