The emo boy in the bad toupet, is having a bad day, the morning/lunch was great...hehe...we shall not get into why. but this afternoon ive felt, i don't know, transparent, maybe just plain invisible, which is strange.   I keep on wanting things to happen over night, like a miracle where we dont have to move, well whatever, we know that aint happening. i started putting a minidisc together for the bbq, its sounding hot. i wonder if our band will play, it would be cool if we did. but i dunno me and ben might just go all dashboard style, that would be cool...there is no alcohol to be consumed, although my sister has assured me she has a solution, which means we all get a bit a booze.   what has happened to this world. what happened to the individual? schools seem more concerned about pushing through clones, than real personnality. Power to the individual, individuals make ideas. never forget that, i will be one of those. they aint touching me. I was watching friends today, and i coudn't help but notice how artifical it was, like it was hollow. plastic. maybe its just me but there isn't sincerity. I like the films and shows that show sincerity. A walk to remember, they show emotion, it's deep, you can feel what the characters are feeling. your their breathing with them, taken on their ups and downs. amazing acting in my opinion, i hope i can show that sincerity, i hope i can show something real, something deep.  the phone rings too often, what do i do, acrophobia is a character flaw of mine. i hate new people, makes me nervous.  the stars are not wanted now,  put out everyone, pack up the moon,  distmantle the sune, pour out the ocean and sweep up the wood, for nothing now , can come to any good.  that is my favorite poem ever, or at least a section of it. i feel like now were leaving that is there a point, ive built my life on this place. it makes no sense to leave now. i guess maybe someday I'll understand, maybe someday, but for today, i will be sad.
