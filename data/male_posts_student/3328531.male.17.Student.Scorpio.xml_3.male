The video is piss-poor in quality and I couldnt see anything clearly! Maybe it was just the video that I saw, but the entire thing looked blurred to me! I did catch the audio very clearly and it was sad to hear the poor guy screaming his lungs out but then, in all my skepticism, I asked myself, "The News did say he was there basically for business, why the hell would anyone go to Iraq for business after the 1980s?" I hate to sound callous, but he really should have been a little more critical before going!   War sucks and so does neo-conservatism!
