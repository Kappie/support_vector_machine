But, all will be well, if it doesn't rain, by around 1 am I will know if daz will be here. If so, cool, if not, I've wiled away the hours by blogging and waiting, rather than blogging and being strange.  Perhaps sleep deprivation will make this more interesting. I will post throughout the night. To eat the boredom.  Oh yeah, don't forget to check out my new postings at Swashagunga's Realm (link over there>>> somewhere). They arent good, but I made the effort!
