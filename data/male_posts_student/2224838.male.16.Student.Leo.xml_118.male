This has turned out to be what will inevitably be known as the greatest comic prank ever conceived. Andy Kaufman, by all accounts, is alive and well at age 55 and is now living in New York City on the upper west side.   urlLink Yahoo! News Press Release   Somehow, this bit of news slipped past me for the past two days, and now that I have heard it, I really don't know whether to believe it or not. The only news site that has released a story on this so far is Yahoo! News, but I can't say that it is the most reputable site. If it is true though, then this is definitely the best prank that I have ever heard of. I truly believed that Andy Kaufman was dead, but I wouldn't put it past him to do something as crazy as faking his death for 20 years.  Anyway, whether you believe it or not right now, "Andy Kaufman" has  urlLink launched a blog , of all things, to update the world on his return and his experiences during his 20 years in hiding.
