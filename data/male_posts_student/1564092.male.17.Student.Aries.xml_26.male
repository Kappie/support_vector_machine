Marching band practice was cancelled because of the massive amounts of rain that came through and that is always depressing to me because I look forward all day to marching band. Everyone that I know of has something going on with one of their friends. It's weird, like something is in the water. Maybe it was in the rain. Maybe it was acid rain and even though it didn't rain until later today the air was very moist and there for acid was in the air. Okay, that was lame but I'm a dork like that anyways. New site is up. I hope you noticed that when you loaded it. I  love  it. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that no one really comments on the posts to much. I was thinking about that and I even thought about taking down the comment feature but then I thought about it and it isn't that bad that no one comments. I don't know how to explain it but I don't comment on people's websites either to much. It is there's and even when I do it is never negative it is always positive. Now that I got my mind off of my current situation that is driving me up the wall for a total of thirty seconds, I will say good night and thanks for sitting through another one of my pointless posts. One last thing- it's Monday night and that means I have SAT vocabulary sentences for English. Here are two of my sentences that I wrote tonight... 2. Sometimes I feel like someone casted an  anathema  on me because I worry about my best friends so much. 4. The  indolence  of the marchers caused us to have to work extra hard at practices. Now that is all for tonight. I hope I used the words correctly. I have ten sentences total but I don't feel like typing more then two because I really need a Mountain Dew before I go and try to sleep.
