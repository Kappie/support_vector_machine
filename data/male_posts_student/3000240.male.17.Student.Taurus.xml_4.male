Jesus knows I'd like an admirable ethic in relation to working, I've been praying on my knees for decades (3 to be exact), but it never seems to be able to pay of. So I've come to the two most sensible conclusions I can think of:  God must really hate me, or i'm just a lazy bugger, Personally I think both hypothesis are quite plausable.    I'm listening to a weird trippy poppy/techno/rock kind of song by the dissociatives and called the thinking in reverse, and from my opinion, its quite a fresh outlook on how to try to construct a decent song. Any of you who are bothered to listen go to  urlLink http://www.thedissociatives.com/music/audio/audio.htm . Wait for it to kick in it takes a while for the initial intro to finish.  Anyhoo, Ian and myself have decided to go house hunting in the little hamlet of Mitcham this Easter. It's becoming increasingly evident to myself that I can't stand living with my parents (an obvious cliche for people my age as I'm sure you're all too well aware of) however, I'm really quite excited by the prospect with living with completely different people, in utterly unfamilier circumstances. I know where I live is comfortable, well of, where people love and respect me (I hope), and money is never an issue really. Life however I know is one great big lord-of-the-rings-est journey and I'm more than curious and ready to find out the difficult circumstances that lie ahead, whatever they may be. As the saying goes (from the great Homer Simpson): "I WANT TO LIVE MARGE, I WANT TO LIVE!". xBuBzx urlLink
