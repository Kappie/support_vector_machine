Tyke imagines that everyone who reads this is either a friend of Tyke or is a friend of a friend and that most likely means someone who goes to IHS.  So, if you are someone who goes to a school other than IHS (BCC doesn't count) and you read this blog leave a comment saying that "Yes, someone that does not go to IHS reads this."  That would be much appreciated.  Oh, and don't cheat.  Anyway, today Tyke went to school and wore His super Karla-able (get it?) shoes which made it feel like he was walking on pillows or something.  They are so silent too.  He could do some real killing in those puppies.  Nothing was fun about Tyke's classes today though.  Nothing was much fun at all.  Sure Tyke laughed and had some fun but nothing about the classes was fun.  Tyke wants to be really happy again.  It's fun being really happy and having that feeling where even though it isn't perfect, life just makes you happy.  And Tyke also wants that so that He doesn't come off whiny and sad when He really isn't feeling that bad.  Just a little above fair.  Tomorrow should change that though because it is going to be sunny and warm.  Tyke has already decided what he is going to wear also.  It's gonna be fun.  Oh yeah, Tyke got His English test back today and guess what He got on it...40!!!  He guessed He would get a 39 and He got a 40.  That was cool.  Sure, it's a C- and it was the lowest grade of all the people who had their scores read off but hey, it is way better than what Tyke has in that class.  So that is cool.  And after school it rained really really hard for a while at Tyke's house but the amusing and very entertaining part of the rain was that it was sunny and warm out.  Tyke opened up the door downstairs and just listened and watched it pour.  It was extremely cool and relaxing.  It didn't have that smell of newly wet cement either which Tyke doesn't like.  Newly dry cement has a nice smell though.  Since Tyke can't recognize that smell He really loves it.  And it means that it's dry out which is almost always a bonus.  Tyke wants to go Go-Kart racing.  Yep, that just randomly popped into His head.  But it's true.  He went for Tolo and that was fun.  That's when He first did some rockclimbing as well.  But yeah, Tyke wants to hang out with some Sly Lion guys too cuz He hasn't in a while.  Like since the bonfire pretty much.  On Saturday though Tyke will probably be playing some bball with Kramm and whoever else of his is able to play.  That would be fun.  Nothing to write.  Nothing to do.  Tyke actually did homework today.  He is scaring Himself.  Tyke must be pretty bored.  Time for other stupid stuff though.
