"The United Nations has failed to organize a special force in Iraq with the limited mission of securing its own headquarters.  UN officials said member states refused to contribute to a proposed force that would protect a UN mission in Baghdad. The mission was meant to mark the return of the UN presence in Iraq after a year's absence and help organize and monitor national elections in January 2005. ....  'We haven't had much success attracting governments to sign up for the dedicated force to protect the UN personnel in Iraq and our property,' Annan said. 'So for the time being, for practical measures, we have no other choice but to rely on the multinational force.' "   So Kofi can't get 'Other Countries' to protect the UN, so he has to rely on the 'multinational force'?  I thought we were 'going it alone' in Iraq?    Bow to the all-wise UN!
