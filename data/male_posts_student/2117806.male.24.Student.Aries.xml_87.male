It's part of an exercise I'm doing in conjunction with Monica to see how we each handle the vague topic of a communcation breakdown.  We're looking to write some sort of story together, but first we need to understand each other's writing style and such.  Hope you like it.  Feel free to comment on it.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: George Harrison, "Let it down"
