The campus held an  urlLink ant-war walkout  yesterday, the same day as  urlLink former President Bill Clinton  spoke about tax cuts and other Bush wrongdoings.  I missed it all due to an early wake-up call for substitute teaching because I need the money.    I can think of few things nicer than a life where I can go to a rally or protest in the daytime, get some writing done in the afternoon, listen to a former president speak in the evening, and edit my documentary opus that night.  I'm getting tired of giving a shit about posessions...and I still do.  I want a big office with lots of books and brickabrack, maybe some framed posters that hold significant cultural meaning...and a window.  I want a comfy couch, a comfy chair, and a big stereo system.  Throw in a big entertainment system too, what the hell.  But it's such a pain in the ass to get these things.  And what does it mean?  Our modes of consumption are so grossly inefficient that the only animal comparable to how we consume is the wasp.  Both do not consume for sustinence or livelihood...they consume to consume; to destroy in a sense.  I believe it was  urlLink Derrida  who said that at some point the aristocracy realized that the best way to keep the masses under foot was to let zem eat cake, basically to give them enough to keep them fat and happy...consumption thus became an appetite that could never be sated.    I have one friend in Costa Rica, another in Ecuador...both are living on the beach, doing God knows what, speaking spanish and enjoying the day, living to live.  It sounds damn nice.  I often wonder if the higher purpose that I like to think I have is egocentric romanticism or hegemonic brainwashing.
