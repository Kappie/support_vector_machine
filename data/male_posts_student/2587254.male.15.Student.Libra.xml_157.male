Not that it really matters since I'm on holiday everyday, but it was still nice to just sleep for 5 hours today after Jason and Gavin left @ 5pm or so and just have no care about whatsoever. After a week of lookalike celebrities shish-kabob contests, cutting my hair, crashing into a siderail at a  OUTRAGEOUS  10km/h, havin' Jason, Gavin and Josh crash at my place, and Jason and Gavin over today, yeah I needed sleep...well more than the 6-7 hours I go the other few days. Sleep....is good. =).  My day today started at 730, waking up earlier than usual for worship rehearsal at the church. So got ready fairly quickly, and headed out the door. Jason slept in today, so didn't pick him up today, and Lina went to do some volunteer work. So yeah only me today, and of course dad drove.  Got to the church 2nd! Vince was waiting there when we got there, but Gavin and Josh, the two "punctual" ones were actually late....REALLY late. I don't blame Josh since he had to do the slide show...but Gavin has no excuse for being late =P.  Worship went really well today in my opinion, and it sounded pretty cool with two guitars, a bass, and drums....and of course who could forget Rebecky on vocals =).  Sermon today was about voting. It regarded mainly of course the UWO students, but was still good to listen to. Pastor D reminded us of how when we vote we should be listening to God, and not to ourselves. It also spoke of how if everyone didn't listen to themselves, and if everyone listened to God, many of our problems in this world would not occur. Good sermon....hope I'll remember it when I'm 18 =P.  After sermon, we went downstairs to be welcomed by a breakfast rather than refreshments. Apparently dad had been cooking all morning for us with breakfast foods of all sorts...well mostly pancakes and bacon, but there were timbits too =). So we all dug in, and then also some of us went to the siderail I hit to re-evaluate the damage. To make my collision feel all that much better huh guys =P. Yeah...I still find it kinda funny how I actually managed to hit the siderail up until now...oh well good lesson learned...plus I learned lots...including the fact that auto transmission cars go without you hitting the gas...they naturally move at 5km/h or so. So after re-evaluating the bent siderail, we all headed back in and then went to Bible Study.  Studied chapter 3 of Daniel today, the story where Shadrach, Misach and Abed-nego were thrown into the fire to die, but emerged alive. Nebudchadnezzar also was surprised to see four people in the fire instead of three, with the 4th person resembling as he called "a son of the gods." That is still disputed by some to have been Jesus or an Angel, but I still think it was an angel. After the study, had lunch at church since we had LOTS of leftover BBQ stuff, and we chatted around for a bit, then Jason and Gavin came to my place.  For the afternoon, pretty much just chilled and gamed...make use of the multitap as much as possible =P.  Then they left and I slept.  And my blog is getting shorter.  One sentence paragraphs are so cool....not.  Anyways I'm out. Later.
