Blogging doesn't QUITE fit, but ne'er mind. Oh, but something's made me kind of grinny and also kind of worried. Some people will know what I mean, I guess.  BBC Radio 4 is commisioning authors to think of a story behind items in a "lost/found" thing in a newspaper. To me, that seems a bit of a waste of money. If you want random things with attempted plot lines that don't work, why not try reading some Sylvia Plath?  And there's a magazine on Suz's floor saying "Gareth said "I Love You"... then dumped me" as a quote from Jordan. My reaction? ...How cool would it be to say that you DUMPED Jordan? ^_^ Personally I wouldn't think twice. She may look good and all that, but I'm not really attracted to her cause she has the intelligence of a radish with breast implants.  *sighs* Laura is cool... it's kind of odd for me to say that... if you're new to my blog, you may not understand it, but I doubt that very much, so my old readers (hi Scott!) will understand it. Indeed. Nah, she's just cool. Everytime I read her blog it emanates coolness, and such. You know what I mean... pah, I don't really know what I mean, so how are you supposed to? To be honest, I don't know who "you" is... the reader? Hello, reader! Wait, I already did that one up there...  ...*hums* Ever got the urge to do something you know you're going to get rejected for? Rhetorical. Don't send me an email about that question, Sarah.  Quote of the day: "I'd give it all for a heart, If I were a king I would give away my kingdom. Treasures and crowns wouldn't mean a thing, If I only had a heart..."  From Sonata Arctica's   Kingdom for a Heart   Love, Jon Roskilly
