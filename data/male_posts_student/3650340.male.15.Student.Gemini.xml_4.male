Life itself seems like a miracle, As I see people swimming and a kid ride a cycle.  The fish jump up with utter glee, The Kingfisher zooms down, for a meal free.  Soon calmness falls over the sea, It sparkles in the shadows of the city.  The throng returns slowly to its domains, As the nightwalkers come out in chains.  The orange Sun sets in the West, Only to pop up again at its best.  The Moon is just out, And silence lays all about.  The Moon falls into the Sea, And the daffodil awaits the buzzing bee…     Tejas
