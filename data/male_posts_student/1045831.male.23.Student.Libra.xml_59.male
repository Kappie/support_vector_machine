Me and Harpole went to the Sandbar and hung out there for a little bit.  we had a few margaritas (Yes I was Wearing my skirt) then we moved on to the meat market which was a pretty cool place.  Had abeer and then decided to roll home.  On our way home we saw Goodvin and some guys driving so we called them and they were going to Fatso's so we decided what the hell and we went to Fatso's too.  Dollar anything so I was drinking Shiner Bottles all night..  Then Harpole left so I got a ride home with Goodvin which was similar to Mr Toad's wild ride.  Craziness ensued from there but I have to go to work right now so I will have to leave you kids hanging...  Sorry..  Your Exhalted Leader, King Zeke.
