'Cause I'll be  reunited  with:  - Taco Bell             - My Car - Naan  Curry - Southland Mall - BART - My Family - Santa Cruz  - Ricers - CSU Hayward            - My Friends (not counting Master P)  ...and these are AMONG OTHER THINGS!  Can you tell I'm excited to go back home for few months?  Oh, don't worry, Seattle.  I'm not done with your ass just yet.  I'm just gonna enjoy a 3-month blow then return for Round 2.  Helpful Tip: "blow" can be used to mean a respite, or "breather".  Impress your friends!!   Umm...insightful comments will be supplied a different night.
