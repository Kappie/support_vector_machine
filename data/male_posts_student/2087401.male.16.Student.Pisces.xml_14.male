I was at some sort of game place, maybe an arcade, maybe a bowling alley, I don't remember.  I barely knew anyone there except some of my cousins.  A lot of stuff happened that I don't remember at all.  Then people starting disappearing in these weird orange beams.  Then I got beamed up, to, and I was in a place so crowded I didn't know where it was.  I pushed my way through into a door, and I was in a cabin, like on a boat.  Jessica was there.  She had a rather gross looking wound just below her neck, and she was worried about it.  I went to get something for it and found I was locked in.  But then Jessica was in the shower.  I suppose she was probably naked but I didn't notice.  I know this part sounds sexual, but the feeling of it definately wasn't.  For all I know she might have been wearing clothes.  I know I was wearing clothes when I stepped in there.  Anyway, again in a non-sexual fashion, I sort of sucked on the wound and spit, like I was sucking out poison.  And then it was gone, and she went over to the bed and went to sleep.  So I did to, in the bunk above her.  I just realized how that parralells the bunk beds in my last dream.  This is getting weird.
