My weariness is set only to get worse as I have just agreed to work today,and most probably for the rest of this week, except that is for Thursday when I will be stuck in a lovely History exam, I can't even say that everything will be fine after I finished my last exam (Monday) but no, I have to go back to school and start learning next years work, then due to a severe lack of funds I will be working all summer. As is usually the case I will go back to school after six weeks more worn out than when I left.  adults think they have it hard, and tell us off for moaning about over-work and tiredness, but i don't see many of them going to school five days a week and then working week-ends as well, in fact I know some people including myself that work weekday evenings just to earn enough money to have a life. As my mums says 'you are old enough now to fend for yourself'. If that is true why does she receive ÃÂ£50 in benefits from the government for me and get nearly ÃÂ£300 pounds in tax breaks for 'supporting a family' wIeI i don't even live with her??  well must dash off to work, on a week-day, wheI i should be revising, but instead need to earn money to wheI i don't turn into some kind of hermit and never chance to see the world outside school, home and work!
