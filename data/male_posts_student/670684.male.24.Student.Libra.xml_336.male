Considering turning  Faith  into a novel...not bad to be multidimensional in my writing.  I mean, I've got a pedigree now...got to use the damn thing.  What good is an MA if I don't use it.    Community college teacher?  Journalist?  I don't know.  Was going to work on my resume tonight.  Didn't do it.  Probably should have.  Oopsie.
