Thats it though.  So Im going to admit that Im pretty jacked up about this show still, and I found out today that I get off work an hour early (Lucky me) to go.  Im glad that the people at this job understand, unlike the wench whore at my old job.  Damn bitch.  Ok, now that Ive gotten that out of my system would you like to know our set list?  To bad!  Its a big naughty secret, like those dirty magazines you hide underneath your bed that you read and think nobody knows about but your dad looks at them too.  Its late right now, and I just wanted to keep this thing updated, you know, for the fans...And then many we will have soon.         WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OVER.
