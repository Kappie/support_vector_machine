There are old traces of the 1930s Japanese culture still lurking inside them - the old steel.    They aren't going to pull out, and if the Islamist actually immolate the hostages, it's going to be fascinating to see how the rest of the world reacts.  Will there be sincere outrage from the Islamic world?  Will the EU realize what we are facing?  And will Japan finally rethink their officially codified stance of pacifism?    I think it's time the Japanese released thier feelings over WW II and re-arm.  We could use them, and I can't imagine them returning to the policies of Imperial Japan, not after the reforms that have firmly taken root there.  The Japanese Soldier was among the best in the world at the time, and they could be again.  Imagine Japanese intensity with American doctrine of firepower!  On second thought...maybe this is a bad idea...
