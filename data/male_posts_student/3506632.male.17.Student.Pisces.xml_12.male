Later enquiry showed that an overloaded bus was struck by a trailer on a bridge in the morning, throwing it into the ravine killing at least 40.  As far as the confrontation was concerned it just didn’t even start, much thanks to the feeble attitude of the other party involved. But on the other hand another confrontation did happen though I have no idea what prompted the start, I am sure that my indifferent attitude added fuel to the fire which was totally uncalled for. As for as the progress of the day is concerned, another accident happened as a plane slipped off the runway, while landing at Chitral airport. Though no body was hurt the Fokker did sustain quite a lot of damage.  Oh and another incident at the academy at Islamabad some doctors from an engineering school SS-CARE came and had a brief presentation. With a fancy slogan of “Bringing Pakistan on the Technology Map of the World” and with an aim of becoming one of the best colleges of the world, they thought that they could allure some whiz kids to their program not even realizing that as long as they are affiliated with UET Taxila, no one with a place at UET or any other better ranked university was even going to come near them leaving only the optimised trash to achieve their aims with.
