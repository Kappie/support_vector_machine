After that i went to summerschool till 12:35, then rode my bike from there as fast as i could to get to tennyson before 1 to get a ride.  After that went to game in pleasanton we won both of them.  I was tired as hell before i even started playing.  Then got back at about 5:30 only to have a nice little 30 min rest then on to doing the scoreboard from 6 to fucking 10.  I have gotten a combined 10 hours of sleep probably in this last week.  I got no more energy for tommorows game at 11 AM.  Just gonna go and do the best i can.  World is also getting worse everyday.  Everything around me is getting worse. Life has gone from terrible to fuckin  i dunno but life is just fucked up.
