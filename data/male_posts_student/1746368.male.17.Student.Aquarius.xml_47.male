Wedding:: 5 years  Roach:: Motel  Expense:: -ive  Fight:: Attendant  Air:: Wind, Fire, Earth  Protect::  Serve  Glance:: Stare  Boo:: AHH!  Steamy:: Hot  Caviar::Blech    For now that will be all. I really think I am going to go back to bed. The "Site o' the day" is "AJokeADay". It is pretty awesome, and it lets you get a joke a day (as the name may or may not imply) in your email. It's pretty awesome and they are never late. It does have a few adds in the email, but those are very easy to ignore. Have an awesome day everyone.
