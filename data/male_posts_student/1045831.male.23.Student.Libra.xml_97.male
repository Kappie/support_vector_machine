It's a beautiful blue-green '94 Honda Accord.  i wish I had a digital camera so I could show a picture of it to you folks but soon I should be adding pictures to this thing which might make things a little more interesting.  But right now I'm off to get some food, a book and then lie to myself about going to work out.  I think it's ok to lie to yourself sometimes as long as you don't start believing yourself.  Ohh yeah I have finals Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday (Whatever).  Ohh another exciting note, I have to get tickets to go to Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic.  It's gonna be great and it's in Fort Worth so if anyone wants to go they should email me or else it will be and maybe my sister and someone from the house.  Well ok I'm off..  Hopefully more exciting things to talk about later.
