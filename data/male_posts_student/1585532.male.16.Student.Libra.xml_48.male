She held a gun to my head and told me if I don't type that an alien spaceship was going to land on Mars and kick the crap out of our rovers, I'd die....  Okay not really, but I'm doing this post because my friend kinda told me to post.  And plus she's super awesome cool because she plays DDR.  Anyways, its been amazingly boring in the past few days.  I did some homework, and....slept.  And slept some more.  Then I got random stuff for my jacket and put it on.  My jacket is like, almost done.  (See- almost out of space)  So that's cool.  I have a bunch of room on the back, but..meh.  I dunno.  Anyways...yah I learned my friend plays DDR.  Which is cool.  Because...not many people play DDR anymore out here.  So yaay for her and playing DDR!  Yaay.  Too bad I like haven't seen her in like...Forever..and ever.  She's cool.  In other news (like theres much to talk about).  Umm...yah.  Oh...I HATE THE FREAKIN' RAIN!  Damn I hate it.  With like...a passion.  Just like I  hate getting wet on water rides.  Seriously.  Take Perilous Plunge at KBF.  If wanted to get  that  wet, I'd take a shower, and at least the shower water would be clean!  Can't say the same for the Plunge water.  Ew.  But the Log Ride is pretty cool...you don't get that wet.  Okay I seriously have nothing else to say right now.  ......still nothing.  So...bye.
