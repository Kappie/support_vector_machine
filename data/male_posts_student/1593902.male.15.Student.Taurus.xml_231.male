Really, I think that's what they were there for, to entertain us kids who had no use for the other 4,500 pages of the Local Tribune. There were a lot of comics to choose from. I seemed to like Wizard of Id more than anyone else I knew. I hated Cathy, and I never got the Family Circus. For all of us, however, there has been one comic that stood above all others, one we could always turn to it. Of course, I'm talking about Garfield...  Many may debate that Peanuts topped Garfield, and I, in my more mature and thoughtful self, would agree with you, BUT when a five-year old reads a comic, chances are they'll get the jokes in Garfield ten times more than Snoopy's trips to shoot down the Red Baron. Yes, we could laugh at Garfield's gluttony, Garfield's violent acts to a dumb dog and a hopeless owner, and while some of us didn't get it, we still chuckled with the orange cat got pied on Mondays.  Some complain that Garfield's not funny anymore, that it's run it's course of jokes. Well, I'd like to see you try to make a new joke every day for over twenty years. Yeah, Garfield's rerunning some old gags, but I like to think of it as showing some generations what they missed the first time around.  On that note, I really hope they bring back Garfield  Friends. You know, so other generations can see it.    .   Garfield's probably the 2nd successful comic strip to be turned into a cartoon, the first being Peanuts. You'd be surprised how many actually tried. Yeah, you had Beetle Baily and For Better or Worse, and yes, even fricken Cathy, but only Peanuts and Garfield made the ranks. Made in 1988, it's been rerunned so many times, chances are you could be nine and still remember it. Still, I feel like I had to make a tribute to such a great show. They picked the perfect voice for Garfield, and the segments were generally funny.  However, Garfield was not alone is caring the burden of trying to keep the interest of three thousand kids every Saturday Morning. No. Remember, this show's called Garfield and FRIENDS!     They were known as U.S. Acres, and they owned one-third of the show. Could the tales of a wacky barnyard bunch help hold up the torch the fat cat was carrying into syndicated television? In short, was U.S. Acres any good? The jury has been a bit split by that, but in my personal opinion, they hold a shining light for the show. They don't beat Garfield, but I still enjoyed watching them. Maybe you will too. So let's take a look back at the days of U.S. Acres.       The style of U.S. Acres was pretty sweet. Not a single straight line in sight, and even though the colors are technically correct, you still can't help but to think you're in some kind of farmyard wonderland. It helps that at any moment, one of the animals was going to pull out a pizza or a rocket ship completely at random. What could have been a boring day at the farm ended up becoming one hell of a field trip.  Our lead character is Orson, the pig. He sort of took a fatherly role in the farm, being the general rule enforcer, the good-advice giver, and the all-around nice guy... Or, at least he tries to. Fact is, things are so out of control on this farm, there is no amount of control that could contain it, and Orson generally ends up blowing his top. Problems tend to fix themselves, though, so Orson ain't dead and on a skillet.  Most of his care goes to two little chicks, which he unofficially adopted. On the right, you see Booker, a mean-tempered chick always after the super-intellegent worm that happens to be the size of a poodle. That's big in worm terms. I always imagined Booker as a more modern, more American Chicken Hawk from the Foghorn Leghorn cartoons, except that Booker never actually got anywhere. Oh well. On the left, listening to a story with Orson, is my personal favorite character, Sheldon. The dude's afraid to come out of his egg because the world is scary. Never mind he seems to function well in it without vision, the ability to eat, or to use a restroom. That egg's really stinky.       That's Roy on the left. He's the rooster, and his job it to make sure you get up in the morning. Does a crappy job of it, too. Roy is the closest thing to a villainy element in U.S. Acres, apting to play a few practical jokes here and there, but he wasn't close to evil, just annoying. Hmm... lazy, annoying, and an animal.. sounds like they wanted Roy to be as close enough to Garfield as they could safely get. Didn't work though. We always giggled when we saw Garfield slurp up a bowl of pasta. Roy doesn't like the French.  Most of Roy's attempts at putting people down was directed to the most down person on the entire farm, Wade the duck. Wade's scared of about everything, including his own shadow, dirt, and hormones, but then again, I don't know anyone who isn't. Scared of their shadow, I mean. Being scared of hormones is stupid. Hey, remember Krang's robot body from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Remember how it's face changed everytime Krang had a new emotion? Well, Wade's got something similar. See that life preserver Wade's got wrapped around his waist? Well, on that pool donut is a smaller, rubber Wade head. It's not just a pool decoration, though. No, it's a magic rubber head. Everytime Wade shows an emotion on his face, the rubber head imitates that expression. And seeing as Wade wears it everywhere, we see it's doppleganging gaze everywhere... and everywhere... and everywhere... I bet you could feel it's eyes on you always, like the eyes of that kid in the coffin in 'Salem's Lot.     Rounding off the cast is Bo and Lanolin, the brother-sister sheep duo. Bo's sort of a hippy/surfer/punkish kind of sheep, and tends to say such complicated words like 'like' and 'whoa' and 'cool' and 'man.' He's the kind of cool cat you wouldn't mind hanging out with with a beer, and that's hard to do, seeing as he's not a cat but a cutesy-wootsy sheep. His sister is a completely opposite, though. High-strung, snappy, unforgiving, and most of the time inconsiderate, Lanolin was the character we all wanted to hate, but we couldn't, because she was a sheep, and all sheep are JUST SO CUTE! The two siblings were generally in conflict, but all in all, it was mostly in fun.  In conclusion, U.S. Acres was a fun little ditty. It probably wouldn't have survived a solo-run away from the cat of orange, but it most certainty added variety to Garfield's shtick.  You know. I feel really good today.
