It was hardcore non-stop pulse pounding coolness.  I want to see it again with some friends, I saw it with my dad, so they can sit in shock as well.  It's really a crazy picture.  I found a dialogue from the movie I liked-  CABELEIRA -  Hey Berenice. Listen, I've got something real important to say. Tell me, you ever heard of love at first sight? BERENICE - Sure but bums don't fall in love, they just get horny.   CABELEIRA - C'mon, you cut everything I say to pieces. BERENICE - Bums don't talk, they just vomit words. CABELEIRA - Jesus, I'm gonna stop wasting my saliva on you, you sure ain't easy. BERENICE - Bums never stop, they just take a break. CABELEIRA - Jeez Berenice, talking about love with you is pretty complicated, isn't it? BERENICE - Love, you gotta be kidding. You're just leading me on.  CABELEIRA - But it's just that this jerk here loves you.  It was funny because this was a reccuring theme in the movie.    Seriously.  It's playing in Maplewood, you need to see it.
