It a bit amazing that you could just cut through the rest and just see that comment. Or did you just stop reading when u saw that? either way Im kinda depressedat that. But for one thing, if u are that offended by what I have writen, all I can say is go fuck yourself... That is all  I liked this one so i kept it Graycat74 tell me if u like it: Anonymous said...   wow cat you're fucking stupid. she doesn't "have" to sit in the back and hide her intelligence. and ontop of that if you paid attention you would notice that she doesn't hide it, she speaks up to prove the teacher wrong. therefore there is no gender bias. you just need to think and get the facts straight before you speak next time, fool. good work jake. the great beginnings of a story. ;) cheers bob  Cheers  = o P
