For the better part of three years I’ve been beating my head against the wall over the Middle East and terrorism, trying to get beyond the surface appearance and really grok the issue from the inside out.  It’s far too easy to sink into the casual racism inherent in the idea that the Arab mind is incapable of being civilized, or that they simply aren’t competent to govern themselves in peace.  I can’t accept the idea that they aren’t capable, but I can examine why it appears this way.  Fundamentally, I believe that all Men are capable of freedom and civilization.  I heartily endorse the words of George Bush when he says that Freedom is the natural yearning of Man.  The problem in the Mideast and elsewhere lies in the structure of a culture and the imposition of values that are contrary to the natural desire to be free.  Nazism, Communism, and now Islam work against Freedom, and remove options from people until they no longer believe they Freedom is a viable option.    I still stand by my statements of yesterday: Islam as it is today is not compatible with modern civilization, nor do I believe that Islam or the Arab culture is compatible with Freedom and Human Rights.  I also believe that a lot of people need to be removed from society before we figure out a way to bring peace to the region.  Nothing like this has ever been done in such a short scale, but the availability of modern technology and weapons place us under time pressure unprecedented in world history.  Past lessons are still relevant, but less so than before.  1)	The structure of Islam.  Islam is a warrior faith.  I make no moral judgment with that statement; it is simply fact.  Mohamed was at war with the dominant Arabian pagan faiths of the time, striving to seize control of the region.  He wrote the Koran while running from his enemies, fighting them, and eventually winning a brutal, bloody war.  The Koran was a sequence of proclamations from Mohamed to his army.  He sold them the Paradise of Allah in exchange for absolute loyalty to his cause.  You’ve heard before that Islam means “Peace through submission to the Will of Allah”, convenient for Mohamed as the voice of Allah.  I’ve read large chunks of the Koran, and you can’t deny the violence contained within those pages.  As a field manual for an army surviving in a brutal era, I can’t quarrel with it. 	As an idea, Islam has been remarkably successful, rising from an idea to a major religion and seizing control of a large chunk of the known world in a few centuries.  It is as powerful as Christianity in its ability to convert and control.  However, where Christianity found a way to outgrow the horror of medieval values, Islam has changed little since its early days.  It is still a faith of the persecuted minority eager to convert the world by the sword.  2)	Islam as a culture Islam as the center hub of culture has manifestly failed to produce a modern society anywhere in the world.  There are two notable exceptions, and both help illustrate my point.   Turkey is more European than Islamic, due largely to the secularization of Islamic life in their society.  The Turks have removed control of the education system from Islamic control, and largely isolated the Imans from political life.  In Turkey, being a Muslim is a personal choice, existing on the outside of public life.  As a result, Turkey is somewhat prosperous, stable, and have nearly earned membership in the EU. Saudi Arabia, and the various small states surrounding it, have their oil wealth to thank for any sense of a modern culture.  Western influence and interest in that oil has forced them to import and accept exposure to western values, bringing with it a veneer of modern life.  Beyond this thin layer of civilization, Saudi Arabia still clings to Wahabi Islam; one of the most virulent strains of Islam.  Beneath the seeming modern culture, the old ways still fester, and Saudi Arabia is one large bomb away from reverting to 1979 Iran.  The role of Islam as the center of Saudi life plays a large role in the fact that most of the 9/11 culprits were Saudi, Usama Bin Laden is a Saudi, and Saudi organizations continue to funnel millions of dollars to Islamic terror groups all over the world.    3)	Middle East violence.  Every Middle Eastern terror organization has Allah and Islam at the core.  I don’t think that can be denied.  They recruit from the mosque community, they draw upon the cultural and religious influence of militant imams, and they prey upon worshiper’s belief that Allah rewards the faithful soldier in his cause, returning to the themes of Mohamed as he battled for control of his region against the pagan infidels.  Islam is a wonderful tool to raise armies and recruit fanaticism.  It seems to be inherent in its structure. Couple this with the theocratic control over the power of the state, and you have serious problems.   In the Middle East, Islam is the center of life.  Being a secular Muslim means trying very hard to convince everyone around you that you are a fanatic, while trying to avoid torture or murder.  The police power of the state coupled with theocratic fanaticism means you keep your head down and try to stay alive.  In such an environment, there is little room for a Martin Luther, or other figure, to preach reform.  Without an external influence to promote a stable and safe environment, Islamic reform is a dead issue.  This brings me to my solution.  It is an extension of what I mean when I say that Islam, as it is today, must die, and practitioners of Islam as it is understood today must be removed from society if they do not abandon their beliefs.  The key to Islam’s compatibility with the modern world lies in the secularization and reform of the Islamic message.  However it is done, Islam’s message, as a warrior faith practiced by an oppressed minority, must be changed.  Islam must be removed as the center of life in the Middle East.  It must be disentangled from government, and de-emphasized as the sole reason for living.  My initial ideas on how to do this are as follows: 1)	Secularization. a.	Some sort of council of respected and credible Islamic scholars must come together under our protection and reform the message of Mohamed.  The Koran needs to be examined and explained, combating the incendiary preaching of theocratic imams.  This council must bring Islam into the modern age by pruning what no longer applies.  The faith must be severed from its roots as a warrior religion.  Essentially, they need a Red Letter King George W. Version of the Koran.  It won’t be accepted immediately, but it is vitally needed as a starting point. b.	Control of the Islamic Message.  The new version of Islam must be preached to the masses.  The old version of Islam needs to be removed from circulation.  We need to make it clear: if you preach death, you don’t survive to give a second sermon.  If you, as a worshiper, try to protect an Imam, you share his fate.  If it brings an uprising, so be it.  We cannot tolerate a faith that continues to preach death and hatred, under any circumstances.   If you preach the New Islam, then not only do you benefit from our protection, you get your own satellite network.  Will people listen?  Perhaps.  I believe a message of hope and peace will always win over a message of despair and death.  Even in poverty, hope always wins.  A New Islamic faith can take root, given enough time, and the suppression of competition. c.	As I just touched upon, the suppression of Old Islam must be undertaken without flinching.  You MUST prune it out and replace it with the new message.  You do that by protecting the new Imams, giving them a forum, and demonstrating that peace begets progress.  The old ways of Fatwa and Jihad must be stamped out with extreme prejudice.  Muslims must be presented a choice. d.	Finally, we must work to secularize both Old Islam and New Islam.  We need to build equivalents to those big freakin’ Baptists Churches I saw all over Atlanta, seating thousands.  We need to make worship more of a social event than a literal interaction with Allah.  We need to offer incentives in a gross, base, and commercial American style: if you belong to this church, you get a leg up on jobs and contracts.  You get perks.  You get the secret handshake that gets you discounts.  Whatever.  Essentially, we need to turn the Mosque into a club.  This meshes with something I’m going to get to in a moment, so suspend judgment on this for a moment.  The second part of this reform is:  2)	Industrialization a.	Iraq has too much idle labor at the moment.  They are a highly educated people, but it’s going to take too long to ramp up the types of industry that can take advantage of their skills.  Therefore, we need to immediately progress to sweatshops.  There is no reason Iraq shouldn’t be making our clothes, shoes and other low cost items that can be manufactured immediately.  Private capital will not flow into Iraq right now with all the trouble, so the American government needs to underwrite these ventures.  Begin employing the teeming mass.  Give them something to do, and give them a salary while they produce goods.  This will gradually raise the standard of living, and eventually, more sophisticated industries will rise up and access the Iraqi skill set.   b.	Further industrialization enhances the secularization of the society.  As people gain employment, they begin to accumulate products and disposable income.  Life becomes a little more enjoyable.  A consuming middle class is a beacon of hope for those mired in poverty, especially if that middle class is grounded in the new social club of New Islam.  Join the New Islamic Mosque, accept the message of peace and hope, and gain access to middle class benefactors that will give you contacts to improve your life.  Attend an underground Old Islamic mosque and find yourself frozen out of access to jobs.  Yeah, it’s an un-American concept, but I think it is necessary for the type of change that is needed. Consumerism brings peace.  It’s hard to imagine a guy with a nice house, good job, an education for his kids, and luxury items like televisions and refrigerators going off and blowing up a bus.  It’s about as likely as an American wanting to die for Catholicism.  Undermining the central role of Islam, either New or Old, is essential to making this work.  Here in the US, spontaneously telling someone you are a Christian usually provokes a strained moment where everyone hopes the conversation doesn’t go into your personal relationship with Christ.  We need the same situation in Islamic countries.  Your relationship with Allah is your business, and should remain part of your private life.  I think the steps outlined above could get us there someday, perhaps in a generation. Reform proliferates through example.  If this works, and a free, happy, prosperous Iraq emerges with New Islam at it’s core, other Islamic states will have to cope with their people asking – “WTF?”  Avalanches start with pebbles.  I’m out of gas here.  I’m sure there are many things I missed that will come to me in a moment, and maybe those things will show up in the comment section.  Of course this isn’t perfect, or fully detailed, but I believe the principle is sound.  No one has ever had to confront a virulent religion in such a short span of time.  History is clear that you can’t stamp out a faith, but it is possible to replace it through alternatives.  Both Islam and Christianity have been successful in doing this in the past, over a long span of time.  We don’t have the luxury, so our efforts must be direct and focused.  This is what I mean when I say Islam must die, as well as those that refuse to turn away from Seventh Century values.  We have to address this.  Ideally, Islam itself would reform, but without the interference of the West, this change won’t occur fast enough to avoid the coming holocaust of nuclear Islamic Republics.  I see no other way.
