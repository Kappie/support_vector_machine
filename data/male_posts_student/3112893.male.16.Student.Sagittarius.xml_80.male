It felt different this time when I arrived in Boston from Los Angeles. I didn't get the same rush as I had so many times before. At first I was confused as to why that familiar feeling wasn't there, but when taking a walk through Harvard Square with my dad, it dawned on me. My family's situation is very different now. Even though my dad might still get 1 or 2 more paycheck from The Media Lab, he doesn't hold the same position that he did. He's now only a visiting research scientist, where before he was an assistant research scientist (better). Then it all came down on me at once and I felt this cold feeling run through me, I don't feel quite so much at home in Boston anymore because my dad doesn't have his standing at MIT anymore. While I wasn't consciously aware of it, I seemed to 'know' that things were different now and I could feel it in me. For the first time in my life, I felt illegitimate. I felt like I was walking in place that didn't belong to me. It was one of the worst feelings of my life.  I told my dad about it and he said "You finally get it. Your bloodline matters. I worked my ass off so that you could be here and get things like this. You finally get it that your standing in the city has to do with your family members." "But I knew that already" I replied, to which he responded "Yes, but you feel it now. It's clicked for you and you can feel it. I love you. I still have a standing here in Cambridge though, and regardless, this place will always be your home, whether I have a place here or not. You grew up here so it's yours. Besides, I still have a number of connections at the lab to have no worries, boy." That was comforting.  In conclusion, while it was exceedingly disturbing to feel illegitimate, I somehow knew that I would always have a right to the place regardless of my dad, but it just seemed to make me feel better to let it out and get some feedback. Interesting.  Now, not that anyone cares about semi-random things like this, but I do... and it's my blog if I remember correctly so I'll post what I want here, thank you very much.  That is all. -- Feanor
