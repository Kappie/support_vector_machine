Gmail  is the new project of  Google.com . Pretty simple, a bottomless e-mail account with cool features. There is actually a bottom, but 1,000 mo is quite a bottom!   Getting a Gmail account is quite easy... Just joking it is not. There is only 2 ways to proceed. You can add your mail to the drawing list (Wich may not necessarly get you one) or simply receive an invite from a person already a member. So basically, as a member you also have 3 invites to give to some of your friends in order to create webs, ingenious, isn't it?   So , you probably all ask yourself : "To who will  Alex  give these incredibles Gmail invites?"   Well, to peoples who frequently use e-mails, that is! I am planning some kind of contest/fun/thing on  msn , then again maybe not. I will think about it.    Oh and you can contact me on  lucidique@gmail.com  !Muhahahahahahahahahah!
