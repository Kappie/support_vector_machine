Worked until 2:30pm, came home with a migraine, and then slept, doped up on Ibobrufen (or however you spell it) and slept until 8 this evening.  Have been having trouble with my blog. Password became invalid after trying to access it via the university's network yesterday. Such a pain in the ass.  Was the same dream again. Time after time. Why won't it just leave me be? What is it? Why can't my sub-conscious thought be in minds with my conscious thought? What do I need to do to finish it, once and for all? I'm sick of waking up on random occasions and feeling like shit for days afterwards. Why does my mind insist on making me relive it time and again? What haven't I learnt from that time? What lesson still eludes me? The lesson of forgiveness? Vengeance? Hate? Love? I wish my brain could talk and let me know....  I feel like seeing that movie "something something of the Spotless Mind". You know the one, with Jim Carey and the Titanic chick, Kate Winslet? Winslow? Wow, my brain is really muddled at the moment because of the migraine. It's mostly passed now but I still have a throbbing head that hurts every time I cough.  I need to eat now. Am rather hungry.
