While I normally don't have a problem with this (quite the opposite in many cases), this current round has me very worried. About a week ago at a fundraiser for John Kerry, Whoopi Goldberg gave a speech in which she used 'innapropriate language' to construct a sexual joke about President Bush. While I don't think that this says many good things about the quality of Goldberg's comedy in recent years, the response of Slim-Fast was far more appalling. Shortly after the fundraiser, Slim-Fast released this statement:   "The manner in which Ms Goldberg chose to express her personal beliefs at this event do not reflect the views and values of Slim-Fast Foods Company...We are disappointed by the manner in which Ms Goldberg chose to express herself and sincerely regret that her recent remarks offended you. Advertisements featuring Ms Goldberg will no longer be on air."   Now don't get me wrong, but doesn't it say in the Bill of Rights that people have every right to say exactly what they want, whenever they want to? While I do realize that the job of spokesperson is one which requires good relations with  everyone , I also cannot believe that it was simply the way in which Whoopi voiced her opinions that caused her to get canned. Slim-Fast knew that they were getting "that kind of humor" when they drew up her contract, but also Whoopi should have known the nature of her employers. She gave them all of the ammunition that they needed to justify getting rid of her. It's sad, but true. Then there is Linda Ronstadt, who after proclaiming Michael Moore a "great patriot" for creating 'Farentheit 911' was asked to leave the Aladdin Hotel where she was in concert. Despite making such dedications at all of her performances since the beginning of May, the Aladdin incident was the first to have sparked any sort of punitive action from the host. A statement released by the hotel shortly after the concert said that Ronstadt had been "Escorted from the Hotel" and that the performer would "not be welcomed back". Despite it being a song dedication, the Aladdin justifies its action by saying, "Ms. Ronstadt was hired to entertain the guests of the Aladdin, not to espouse political views."  These and similar incidents lead me to believe that free-speech is likely in as much peril as all of those other things on the Bill of Rights which we take for granted every day. This is certainly not the America which I began my life in.
