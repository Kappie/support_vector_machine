After 4 days, it's still there. Those kind hearted ppl in tt lan shop actually keep a whole lot of unclaimed EZ Link cards and I.C in a phone book! L0L! Tt's realli nice of them rite? =]  Anyway, in the end we decided not to go Queenways. We chose to scout around Orchard Road as it was the Great Singapore Sales. L0L! We had lunch first at Subway, den we played pool for about an hour plus at Cineleisure. After tt, we walked around Orchard Road to find a suitable pair of shoe for myself.  I wanted to get a pair of outdoor shoes, preferably adidas. Well, but the price was too high, so I didn't get a pair. I'll probably go to Queensway on another day to get them. Haha, but we juz walk around Orchard Road. There was this pouch I realli like at the 77th Street in The Heeren. I didn't buy it at tt time as I was still considering if I shld buy a pair of shoes. I also didn't haf enough money to buy both. So I didn't buy it in the end and I realli regretted it after I realise tt the price of the shoes was juz too high.  So we went to Plaza Singapura's 77th Street to check if it was sold there. We couldn't turn back and return to The Heeren as it was too far and Benson was simply too LAZY! Haha, but unfortunately it wasn't sold there. I managed to buy a pair of shorts and a bracelet. It cost me $44 in total. Well, it was expensive, but I felt tt it was worth it. I actually wanted to get a ring or a necklance too, but there wasn't any rings I liked tt was fitting and the necklaces were kindda expensive. Although Benson offered to pay for me first, I politely rejected it. L0L!  We left Orchard around 9pm to Benson's house. When We were waiting for the train at the Dolby Ghaut MRT station, I was trying on the new necklace tt Benson bought. Honestly, it was quite nice. L0L! There was this erm, gay? Well, I'm pretty sure tt he's a gay! Even Benson said so! Firstly, he wore a pink shirt and secondly, he stood realli like a gay. I dun even noe how to describe the way he stood. The worst thing was tt he was staring and smiling at me when I was trying on Benson's new necklace. Well, this happens pretty often and juz proves tt I'm attractive, but on the other hand, I'm attracting the wrong sex. There are a couple of times when I notice other 'men' staring at me too! OMG! I juz hate it when 'men' stare at me or gif me those kindda seductive face (doesn't tt reminds us of some1? FPC!!! L0L!)  When we reached Benson's house, he packed his stuffs for tmr while i waited patiently. His room is worse than mine! It's messier and untidier than my room! L0L! We slacked there for about half an hour b4 going to the coffee shop near his house for dinner. Then we took a bus to Bukit Batok interchange and went our separate ways. I reached home like 11pm! L0L! I think tt's the latest tt I've ever reached home.  I took a shower and waited for the Euro 04 opening match to start at 11:50pm. It was Portugal against Greece! Portugal was the team I actually supported, but my bet was on Greece. L0L! Well, *sighz* Portugal realli did lose to Greece. The final score was 2-1 to Greece, which was a total upset. Well, I'm still supporting Portugal no matter wad man, Figo my man is in there! Haha, the next match was Spain and Russia. It was a pretty boring match, but I knew frm the start Spain was going to win. I actually tot tt they would score at least 3 goals, but to my surprise, they onli managed to score 1. The final score was 1-0 to Spain.  When everything was over, it was like 4:30am in the morning. I onli managed to slp at like 5:30am. L0L! Well, tt's about it I guess. Cya around! =]
