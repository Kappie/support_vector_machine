Easily.  They go around in the middle of the night a big, colorful van, looking for monsters and  food .  I imagine they did about 5 hits of acid and a lot of pot to see what they see, and eat what they eat.  Would you eat a sandwich that had been sitting in the middle of an old, abandoned house that's covered in spider webs?  I bet you would if you had the munchies like they did.         The friggin' dog is high!!!  How did that happen?  "Scooby, NO!  Don't eat that!!!  Oh well....  Hey Scoob, want some cheetos???"  It must've taken years and years of blowing smoke in his face to get him to talk.  Anyway, now that you know about the TV show, I'll get back to the real problem, the movie.  This is all I know, and all I'm willing to know before I see death:         I wouldn't see this movie if someone shoved the movie down my throat, and stapled my head to my ass........  For one reason or another, the gang goes to somewhere called "Spooky Island" (what a crappy name!).  There they meet ghosts and other weird acid visions that drive them to figure out why all this is happening.  Eventually one of them has a plan, they try it, it works, they uncover the evil person, ("I would've gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids!") they all end up happy, and everyone laughs because Scooby the pill dropping dog ate too much, the end.  I think the bad guy is supposed to be Scrappy-Doo (Scooby's deranged, crack-addict, nephew).  What kind of plot is that???    If anyone says, "sequel" I'll go berserk and kill the next talking dog I see.......  Go America......  No drug-usage on TV.....Unless you're a dog.....
