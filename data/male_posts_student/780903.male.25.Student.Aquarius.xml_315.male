"A Whole New Grade"  I can look at your test This time actually read it Random grades, I concede it Makes my winter break a breeze  Did the questions make sense? I didn't actually write them Stolen from a website, them Cut and pasted them with ease  A whole new grade I've never seen this done before Actually turn the page And try to gauge The value of the answer  A whole new grade That students care, I never knew But since you seem concerned And law you've learned I think I've got a whole new grade for you  Wow, this answer's not bad Maybe if I had read it Gave you good grade instead - it Seems to spot the issues well  A whole new grade I'm gonna help your GPA You'll graduate cum laude The system's flawed Perhaps you'll clerk at where I used to be  A whole new grade You've new horizons to pursue Job offer anywhere A millionaire Make partner with this whole new grade for you  A whole new grade Erase that C If there's a way You'll have an A [and just to complete the fantasy] ...and law school's free!
