I am so exhausted today - my hands have blisters on them.   Jame's boat is so interesting to look at. He recently bought it in Granberry for cheap. It doesn't have the best color combinations. Actually it looks like a baby-blue Barbie? Speed Boat. hahaha. It's fast as hell though. He needs to get it painted. Three guys in a baby-blue(with a hint of pink pinstirpes) looks like a pride run on the lake. Whatever.   People were still going "ooo and ahhh" over the speed. If it was black and red, it would look like the Bat-Boat from the live action series in the 60's.   MiMi had a phone interview with a district and regional manager from the Bay Area. She will find out if she got the job at the end of the week. I am kinda interested in how this will go, so far is sounds very likly that she is a shoe-in for the position. I'm happy for her. She will be moving out there soon than expected - at least, that is the way it looks.   current mood:  exhausted current music: coldplay
