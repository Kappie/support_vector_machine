Thank you even for the guidance when we could not find our way around. Indeed You are a prayer answering God who knows our needs even before we bring them to You.  Lord, prepare my heart as school is starting and help me to glorify you even in my studies. Even more importantly, give me no peace until I get back into close fellowship with You and other christians. Bring me back to church and use me to reach out even to those who are dear to me.  There are issues in my life that I need to sort out. Lord, help me to live my life for you. Change me to be more and more like You. Purge me of my weaknesses and strengthen me from within.   I commit all these into your loving hands, asking all these in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Amen.
