I get a script from a translator, who drafts a rough and often literal version of the original speech into English.  Then I take that, rewrite and polish it up, and it goes either to be timed or, if it has already been timed, to be encoded for release.  At least, insofar as I understand the process.  Japan-TV, as the name suggests, primarily concentrates on Japanese dramas, but we also do Korean and Chinese shows as well.    For whatever reason, it seems to be the case that Chinese translations are the worst.  A script from a Chinese show usually requires at least half-again as much time to edit into understandable English as a Japanese program.  Now, this could simply illustrative of a particular translator's skill, but since this seems to span more than one translator, I have my doubts.  I suppose our entire Chinese translation staff could suck, but I really don't think so.  At any rate, the additional difficulty is one reason why I don't like doing Chinese series, but it isn't the only reason.  I've only worked on two Chinese shows, A Step into the Past and Monkey King.  I've only done one episode of Step, but I've done three for Monkey King.  Both shows seemed extraordinarily stupid, and as I busily turn Engrish into English, I can't help but wonder how dumb someone has to be to actually watch then.  Someone must, because people download them, but I can't for my life understand why.  I once tried to watch an episode of Monkey King, because I like to see episodes I edit.  Partially it's to look for errors and what not, but there's a certain element of satisfaction in it.  After all, if I didn't feel that the work was, in some sense, a worthy achievement, then I wouldn't do it.  In any case, I made it barely ten minutes in before I closed the stupid player.  Three sittings later I finally finished the episode, and I haven't bothered with another one since.  If none of this made any sense to you, visit Japan-TV and download it for yourself.  You can find the link listed on this page.  Beware the Monkey King.
