Dinner was good, movie was great, company was enjoyable as expected.  The wine, and OH the wine.  It was good.  Lola falls asleep on the couch, so I decide that I would drive her home, after having consumed at least 6 glasses of wine.  A feat that had been successfully accomplished countless times throughout my life.  We gathered her things (including the remaining wine left her in bottle) and headed out.  Things I learned last night:  1.)  Apparently when you turn a corner, it needs to be at a RIGHT angle (since that's possible)  2.)  If you do not make said right angle, you will be pulled over by a Norman Police Officer, even though you're already in the apartment complex of your final destination's parking lot.  3.)  When a cop sees a bottle of wine in the passenger seat, he will automatically make you "step out of the vehicle"  4.)  When said officer makes you follow a pen with your eyes and not with you head, try not to soil yourself and also try to concentrate HARD!  5.)  If a cop asks you if you have an open container in the vehicle, say yes, because chances are he already saw it when he first came to the window (I said no), and he will then go search the car for it to see if you were lying.  6.)  Even if your trusty friend covers the bottle with a jacket, the bastard cop will still find it.  6.)  Being over the limit and "arrestable" doesn't necessarily mean you will be arrested.  7.)  I am a lucky son of a bitch because I now have a ticket/warning for transporting and open container, rather than a night in jail and a police record.  8.)  And least importantly, when you have an open container and they find it: THEY TAKE YOUR BOTTLE OF WINE!  Rat Bastards!  So, summary and wrap-up:  Mister cop was actually nice in the end and used scare tactics.  No breathalizer = he only assumed I was "over the limit,"  but wanted to make sure we knew we were naughty for driving.  Thankfully I was giving someone a ride home, which looks good, and not like I was hot-rodin' around town.  I could have been arrested, but somehow, somewhere, someone was smiling down on us, and I'm a free man.  Thank you mister Norman cop, enjoy your wine, and I'll enjoy my freedom, and we'll call it even.  All in all, we are very lucky.  What an experience!  I had a blast lauren!
