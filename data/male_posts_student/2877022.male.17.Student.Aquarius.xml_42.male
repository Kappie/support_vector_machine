You might infect half the class..meaning we'll have a empty class,which means teachers might cut us some slack and we can give the excuse that "half the class is not here",which means our workload might be lessoned,which means we have more time to write in the blog,which means we'll have a life,which means...... (u get the picture) #2. (this is the  best  part) You might infect the chem teacher!!  H  O  O  R  A  Y !! she hasn't got immunity yet,she told us during chem prac.so u are actually doing her some good by GIVING her immunity by infecting her...good eh?2 in one. yup,u know what u have to do ;) -nus
