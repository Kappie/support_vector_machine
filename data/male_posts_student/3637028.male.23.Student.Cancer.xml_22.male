It only took me 5 years and 1 summer term to finish this 2 year program, but I did it.  I haven't gotten that little piece of paper yet declaring my accomplishment, I'm not even sure if they give those out for A.A degrees, and I've got to try and get it before I leave for Houston or at least have it sent to the new address.  The only problem with getting this done is that now I have to declare a major at  urlLink UHD  and I don't have a clue what that is going to be.
