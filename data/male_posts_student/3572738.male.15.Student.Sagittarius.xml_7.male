So as you can tell I like the RHCP gods of rock!!!!! They are my masters. I play guitar and bass totally in this wicked rockin band. As of yet we are unnamed, but that will change soon! I'm hyper right now. Hmmm, Cheese.  My next posts will be far more structured I just thought I'd scare you all. Boo!!!!!! Ha...hahaha.  Good night all you kung-fu hippies. -Reverend Doctor G-Squeeze PS: I like roller skates. PPS: That's a lie I friggin' hate roller skates.
