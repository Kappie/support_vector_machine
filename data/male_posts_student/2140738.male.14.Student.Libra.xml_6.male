Then somehow I was out of the canoe, in the water. One of the parents in a canoe was trying to help me, but then my feet hit some rocks and I lost my shoes. While the whole river went one way, at one point there was a place that went the other way, in the middle of the river, towards a hole (but it wasn't a pipe or anything. It seemed natural). Then all of the sudden we're at the airport, outside, getting ready to board a plane. It was a small one where you have to go out on the tarmac to get into. Again, it was the same group. After about five minutes of waiting out there, we boarded the plane. The interior had really bad colors and was like the interior of a train. At the front were two sets of benches (on either side of the aisle) that faced eachother. Then there were somewhat big windows with green shades/blinds. Then, as I was sitting down, I saw my grandmother on the plane, as well as other people in the band that I recognized. Then it skipped to when we were transferring to another flight or going back home. This time the airport was in Montreal. I went to get some food from the fast food place there. As I was walking back, I saw everyone checking in, so I rushed to the counter and tried to check in. They said that they couldn't find my ticket. Then the clerk took me to this shelter across the tarmac, where everyone was waiting. We talked to my music teacher, but he said he couldn't buy me another ticket. He then suggested for me to call my parents to pick me up, ever though it was a 3 hour drive (one way) to get to Montreal). Then the clerk told him about this "traveler in distress" pass, which if I were to go on standby, I could get onto a flight for free if there were any seats available. So the clerk took me back to the counter and I used a pay-phone to call my parents and I explained the situation. Then as I turned around, I saw my mother standing there, looking around for me. I ran up to her, hugged her, and I woke up.
