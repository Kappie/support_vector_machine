Actually, I'm getting more and more excited about this every day.  I found out I'm going to be staying at Penland, which, if it's anything like its food, is an awesome dorm.  I was worried I'd end up staying in one of the crappy dorms, but it all ended up working out.  I thought it was funny when my mom asked if I was going to register to take my car to the program.  Silly mother!  You know that prolonged exposure to heat (since I would drive it there and then be forbidden to for the next four days) makes my car a very irritable monster.  She must've had temporary amnesia.  Ah, and so the time has come to set goals for the summer.  I always love doing this because strangely it's usually these goals that I actually accomplish (unlike frivolous things like New Year's resolutions and I'm-turning-a-year-older-so-I-need-to-change-things resolutions).  Like last year: I said I wanted to: 1) go to MOWW and at least try to be social (check!), 2) go to Stanford and have the time of my life (check!), 3) break out of my shell and be more outgoing (check!), 4) go to band camp and have fun getting to know everyone (check!), 5) work on French (check!) and start learning a new language (Italian; check!).  All right!  Well, this summer's no different.  Here you are, ladies and gentlemen.     Philip's Top 10 for Summer 2004 : 1) Get a job  2) Go to LIFE, make some new friends, and learn something 3) Find a couple of places to volunteer 4) Step up as Division 4/Regimental/Batallion/Unit Young Marine of the Year 5) Go to band camp and do more as a student leader 6) Learn a new language (Portuguese) and work on the others 7) Read at least five (whew!) books that I want to read, and then buy books off the AP Spanish and AP French Literature lists 8) Take up writing again (i.e. short stories, poetry, novelettes, and episodic dramas--you know what that means ;-)) 9) Complete at least two new musical compositions 10) Produce CDs of a couple of my songs to send off to my friends from JSA  I'm sure I'll think of more later, but for now, these will do.  Will it happen?  Yes.  I just have to remember two things:  ENGAGE!  And make it so.  (I heart  Star Trek: TNG )
