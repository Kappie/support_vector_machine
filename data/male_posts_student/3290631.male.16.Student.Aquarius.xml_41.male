Anyways, we basically just go to HPREP every Friday after school, listen to a speaker, work on our research papers, and then go home, but last Friday, we got to do the most awesome thing ever.    They took us down to the basement lab as a surprise and we got to examine the cadavers!  It was literally, one of the most amazing moments in my life.  I held a human heart in the palms of my hands!  Not very many people get to do that at all!  My group had this massive overweight guy--not obese, but he was a big guy.  This guy must have had the  worst  diet ever.  His thoracic and abdominal cavities had already been opened and the inside of his skin was lined with a 1 inch thick layer of fat!  We saw the med student pull out his intestines, his stomach, his liver---all that awesome stuff.  The heart and lungs were the only organs that had been removed, they were removed for us to examine more closely.  This guy's heart, was three times the normal size because of his lifestyle, in fact that's what probably caused his death.  As your heart grows in size because of an unhealthy lifestyle, the muscles responsible for pumping blood don't grow at all, so it becomes increasingly hard to pump blood efficiently.  So this guy probably died of heart failure.  I was also examining his lungs, and I was holding the left one, when I turned it over and saw a red piece of glass lodged in his lung.  I walked over to one of the Med students and asked him why there was glass in his lung and he said, "Nah man, that's a blood clot."  A blood clot!!!    Another interesting note was that all the cadavers were headless, because the 1st year med students study the anatomy  and physiology of the body, while the 2nd year med students focus on the brain.  Man it was so awesome.  It was such an amazing feeling to experience our mortality in such a realistic way.  I'm really honored to have had an experience like that, that most kids or anyone else for that matter don't have a chance to have.
