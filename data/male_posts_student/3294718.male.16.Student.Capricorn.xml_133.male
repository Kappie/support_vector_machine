My favorite show's were definately Bouncing Souls and Anti-Flag cause the hit all their best songs and really got the crowd involved, especially Anti-Flag. Speaking of Anti-Flag, they have some crazy violent fans. I didn't want to get involved in the moshing, but the whole crowd was a giant pit so the mosh came to me. I got elbowed in the head and kicked in the face by a crowd surfer. Other than that it was awesome. Got some stuff signed by Bouncing Souls and Tiger Army. Tiger Army also put on a kickass show. Also got a cd signed by 3/4 of the Casualties. I missed the bass player though.    Another thing, the Democratic Convention. You know that you are going to get your ass kicked in an election when fucking Ronald Reagan's son is speaking for Kerry. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
