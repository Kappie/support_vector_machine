One yellow with green hair, the other pink with blue hair. Each with a unique Nightcrawler-ish tail. A gutter sweeps the two away from each other.  16 years later, neither one knows the other exists.  Cinkaeko Citadel, North Island. A female hedgehog walks through her house and turns on the TV. "Sa2b Destructico Tame saved Central City for the third time this week," she turns the TV off and turns to walk out the door. As her trench coat flies up from the force of the turn, her most noticeable feature is the white-blue Nightcrawler tail. When she reaches the door, she vanishes in a puff of smoke.  Central City, South Island. Sa2b Tame and his girlfriend Juliet "Foxy" Prower, a yellow two-tailed fox with white-tipped purple hair, are watching Rouroni Kenshin on TV when there is a knock on the door. Sa2b gets up and walks over to the door of their hotel penthouse suite. He opens the door and is instantly tackle-hugged by the mysterious pink hedgehog. "BRO!" she yells, "I've been looking all over for you!" "Who are you?" asks Foxy. "My name is Noire Catastrica Tame. I'm Sa2b's sister." "Whaaaaaaaaaa?!?" Foxy and Sa2b said simultaneously in an anime type fashion. "Yep. We were separated 16 years ago." Sa2b (who finally gets a solo speaking line in) asks, "How could you remember something that long ago?" "That depends," said Noire, "do you know what you had for breakfast all last week?" "Well, no." said Sa2b. "Exactly." Hobbes Tygre walks in the room. "Hello," he says, "who are you?" "I'm Noire. Who are you, cutie?" said Noire, cooly. "Uhhhh, I'm Hobbes Tygre." said Hobbes, nervously. Suddenly, an explosion rocked the hotel. "Awww, man! I just replaced that wall  last  week!"   To be continued...  -Sane Intolerant-
