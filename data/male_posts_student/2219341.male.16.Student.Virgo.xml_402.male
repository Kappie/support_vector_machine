"  and what would i say when i came face to face with my Lord on that day?  what would i say to the one who bore the sins of the world?  "  i'm sorry, Lord.  you died for ME.  you gave ME salvation.  you gave ME hope.  yet i was too blind to see.  i just couldnt live with the pain of life.  i couldnt handle it.  though you bore the pain of the world on that cross.  i couldnt bear the pain of one single lifetime.  this is how i repay you, Lord.  this is the fruit of your sacrafice.  me.  the weak pathetic soul that gave up.  "  how could i do it?  how could i spit in the face of the Christ by giving up the gift he gave to me?  my guilt saved me that night.  and i now live each day with a different view of life.  i am not afraid to die.  nor am i afraid to live.  i am thankful for what God let me see.  i am thankful for the experience of near suicide.  it has made me stronger and wiser.  but i still feel the guilt of what i nearly did.  i live everday with the shame.  i feel so terrible that i live while other good people die and suffer.  people who never would have through God's gift away.  why cant it be me?  why cant i suffer for them?  i was the one who threw away His gift.  they dont deserve the pain.  i have known for so long now that i would die for anyone.  to save one life... i know i could give mine.  i feel so humbled in the presence of my friends from church.  because i know that most of them would never dream of throwing away their gift.  i feel so ashamed to call myself one of their friends... and i have never told anyone.  ever since that night... i have felt so unworthy of the second chance i have gotten.  i am blessed.  because i now can see both sides of life.  i've seen the joy of life and the emptiness of life.  and i can now help.  and thats what i intend to do.  i want to spend the rest of my life helping those who have no hope.  i want to give them a reason to live.  that is my goal in life.  if i can help just one person... then this second chance God has given me was not in vain.  all that i have just told you is my darkest confession of what i almost did.  it is what haunts me everyday.  deep inside... in the back of my mind i know its there.  this that i have shared is  my requiem .
