It's like asking people to judge you.  C'mon, you would know yourself better (don't dare deny).  Or probably it has no innate meaning.  It actually means nothing as it is.  It is like an unconscious fantasy, is all.  However, it needs a foundation to come into being.  This foundation would be our experienced memories, and innate generic reactions.  Thus, a dream becomes meaningful because, by recollecting the source of such a dream, which is our unconscious or conscious memory, we get to know ourselves (which is better if we are unaccustomed to paying attention to ourselves).  Does that explain some or what?  Hey, I thought Bojac joined to talk here?  Well, where is he?!!!
