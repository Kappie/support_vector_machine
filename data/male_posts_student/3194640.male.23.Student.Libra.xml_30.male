I don't know why I was thinking that! I'm freaking out about my quiz for some reason. I'm sure everything will be okay in the end.  I'm pretty excited that I will (if all goes according to plan) get a  urlLink Gmail  account (thanks to  urlLink GmailSwap.com ).  urlLink Gmail  is an awesome free service that offers 1gig of space. It is currently by invitation only. Thanks to  urlLink GmailSwap.com , you can offer stuff (or to do stuff) for people looking to give away their invitations. I'm offering someone a Ben Folds Five single.  My wife and I bought a guinea for my wife's birthday (which isn't unitl the end of the month, by the way). I've never had a guinea pig. She's pretty fun and has crazy fur. My wife hasn't named her yet.   Until later.
