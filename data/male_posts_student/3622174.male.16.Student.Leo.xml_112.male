I would have to kill myself if my last name was that.  Then I would change my last name.  Anywho.  This week started off really bad, and now its one of the better weeks of my summer, and I haven't done anything to promote this being the best week.  I'll probably be coming at you live from Universal Studios on Saturday, but I don't know yet.  I'll audioblog it if I am, but, I may not go.  I want to, but, my parents may not be going down there this weekend.  We'll see what happens.  It's too dang hot to be hanging around these theme parks, in my opinion.    I'll be reaching my 100th post on Blogger pretty soon.  It's hard to believe that I have gotten this far already, but, hey, by the end of the year, what will be in store for this blog?  Too addicted teh B10gg3r!    So Shortney got a job...is that motivating me at all to get one?  Hell no.  I'm too damn lazy!  I'm still doing some of that typing for my mom, but, come this fall, I'm going to have to find one.    That's it for now.  Expect Late Night Bloggin' later tonight.  Adios!
