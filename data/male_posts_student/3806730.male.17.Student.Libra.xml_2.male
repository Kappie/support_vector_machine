The Word was about Jesus, being the light of the world.. and how his being the light means.. basically the pastor gave us 3 points - the Benefits of Light. (1) Light conquers darkness.  There really is nothing to fear because we are sure that anything and everything that comes our way is already overcome.. In the end, it'll still be light that's gonna reign over darkness.  (2)  Light gives direction.  We know where to go and how to do stuff because JC leads us and shows us how.  He enlightens us - not to force us to do something or go somewhere - but guides us lovingly as a Father and friend.  (3) Light exposes what is unseen.  This isn't supposed to be negative.. We sometimes don't see what's wrong with us until somebody has the guts to tell us, or if we learn it the hard way.. well light kind of does this.. like looking at a huge mirror with light bulbs all around it.  We wouldn't miss a pimple, scar, discolored patch of skin, blackhead, whitehead or whatever that may be. God doesn't want us to remain the same.. He wants us to reach higher heights, and be more like His Son JC.  I'm just waiting for my roommates to get back.. then we'll probably study til 11pm.  My Monday and Wednesday skeds aren't that full, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  Tuesdays and Thursdays however are serious matters.. it's such a relief I don't have class on Fridays.
