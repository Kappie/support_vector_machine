Met my Ghanian friend, Ebenizer.... well i havent sopken to him in a long time since i first saw him at manchester.I have said hi-how are you - bye though whenever i see him.Decide dto go ask god for help. Visited church , attended a sermon( i appreciated the music was rockish - gospel) and listened to a weired sermon about gates and shutting the darkness... all i could think of was gates to shut her out and gates to hold me in , so that i can stay aloof... and not think of her anymore.  After that i went and watched Bruce almighty (again) .. his last 2 wishes to god.. um i'd have asked the same for her.It kept making me wish i were dead. I cant i just miss her .. aint got anyone to speak to it about, hold it all inside.  Then decide dto visit an other indian friend. Lunch at his palce.More taling .. still had her in my mind.She doesnt wanna leave.   Came online, and spoke to her BF . " just her fears about some things. she does love me and the feelings are there i just need to build on them " that hurt bad. really really bad. why cant i let go of her ?   Decided to run away.Dont know where. Met Rita Rotsalynan ( Finnish female from work) she used to speak to me, benice to me .. she has suddenly turned snooty .. well i dont care. wish she had invited me to her place to hang out with her  . all i wanted was some one to speak to.  Decided to go to the movies. I biked half way .. walked around the river bank for about 2 hours..ranting and raving at god... he's not listenin. Wanted to speak to some one so badly ..,. decided to call Dave his mobile numbers changed (is he really my best friend if he cant tell me about the change in his number ?) kept trying ... wanted to call her up and say "  why dont you get the hell outta my head "  walked a long distance until i reached a section where there was no track .. ploded along .. but decided not to go any further as it got thicker along the banks ... missed her loads and loads .. why cant i just let go ?  Decided to go and watch a movie . watched "The dAy after tomorrow". everytime the camera zoomed in on Sam's (Gyllenhaal) g/f .. all i could do was think of her.Still feeling sick about the entire episode.The movie was ok.
