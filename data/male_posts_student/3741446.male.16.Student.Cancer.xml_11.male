Just because you joined seven months before a person it some how makes you more superior than them? You know what fuck them and fuck people who think like them.   I remeber at techtv no n00b got made fun ragged on unless they totally deserved it. That's why I liked techtv everyone practially knew everyone and really respected eachother post count or no post count.   I admit I do that myself sometimes but most of the time I'm joking. So the next time you rag on someone because they joined later than you do us all a favor and kill yourself.....yes I meant that literally.
