No takers?  I wonder why...  So last night after my Blitz of posts, I began reading "Ecstasy Club," a novel by a fellow named Doug Rushkoff.  It's about a bunch of club kids and raves and such.  Seems like an interesting book.  I guess I'll wait and see.  I suddenly have the urge to gamble.  I wonder if there is poker to be had anywhere in the area.  -Mike  "Something in the way she explains to me,"Please be careful, I exist in someone else's head," oh no. Something in the way that she makes believe,please be careful Annie dreams that everyone is dead."
