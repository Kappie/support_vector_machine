It was the first time i played with these guys since 9th grade so i was pretty excited. Firstly, we destroyed these freshman punks that sucked so bad, it made me happy when i put one of them on his ass, especially after his cheap slash to one of my team mates helmets.. but the better story is about to come. We played a group of kids from suffern, and these kids sucked sooo much. Even though their skills were horrible, their goalie was amazing. His shot was faster than theirs and he was more accurate then all of them combined. Well to make a long story short he lit me up a couple times (the tournament was held in a gymnasium, so you can determine the size of the playing field). But one time he tried to be fancy and do a pass to one of his team mates right on my crease... well his pass was a little too close and high. the kid jumped up, looked away for two seconds, and when he was coming down, i fuckin LAID HIS ASS OUT!!!! it was one of those hits when the entire crowd goes "ohhhhh" and the person rolls over backwards (as in feet over head). after a good 5 mins of whining about the "no checking" policy which i obviously didnt care about, we lost 6-16 (wich sounds like a lot... and is...) but my friends, it was totally worth it
