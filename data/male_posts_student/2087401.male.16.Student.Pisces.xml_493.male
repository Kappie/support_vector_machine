Jonah-- Yeah, Nathan can definitely read Monstrous Regiment. It is good, isn't it? :) I think the only reason I bought the Corndog thing was because I was in a heightened emotional state, due to my recent publication. And the Moulin Rouge soundtrack does have some of the good songs on it. Like the Elephant Love Medley. I love the Elephant Love Medley. I love it whenever Ewan McGregor belts out pretty words.  Plus, if you guys who were gone haven't heard about JournalCon 1.5 yet, all I can say is that it involved the word "bitchpants." Quite a lot. And how often do you get to say that?  I'll go do the Friday Five now.    It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.
