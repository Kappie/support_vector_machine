    
       I recently conceived of two new inventions.  One, which I thought of with Jonny's help, is an ultra-smALl computer with an ultra-large screen (which takes up virtuALly no space and has virtuALly no mass or dimensions), and a full-size keyboard*.  Two, which I thought of independently, is a compact ergonomic combination pen (with multiple colors of ink), pencil, and eraser*. I'm ALso trying to work in a white-out dispenser.  *I will not elaborate due to the current state of my patents (non-existent).
