The check engine light keeps coming on and I have a weird rattle and the thing acts like it is going to die when it idles.  I just dumped 200 bucks into some brake stuff and it still acts weird.  After picking up my vehicle tonight and driving my wife home in it so she could experience what I feel everyday..  I almost started to cry.  She is bound and determined not to let me have my Jeep until  I get out of school 10 years from now when gas vehicles won't exist.  BAH!!  I'm sick of feeling like white trash as my headliner in my car flops around in the wind as a drive to and from work!  Rob
