Oh well.    Did I mention someone (possibly high on PCP) decided to test the strength of my door last Thursday morning?  Well they did.  And I tested my ability to move from deep sleep to adrenilne rush in less than a min.  My fingers also got a work out dialing 911.  Now my abilities to work the system and reading the fine print on a lease will be put to good use.  Here's hoping there's some justice for someone who wants to live in peace without looking around his apartment to see what he can use to defend himself.  Latenight goodnight
