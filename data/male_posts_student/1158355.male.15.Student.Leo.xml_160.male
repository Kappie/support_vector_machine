We went to Eric's, then down his hills, then back to Eric's, then more people came grrrr, then we went to Dan's, we played Mario Kart, then I went home, then back to Dan's. Jimmy came also. We had some fun playing more gamecube, we were too tired to go to Pat's and play in the snow. Overall the day was great. Especially playing war with Eric's toy soldiers and his big baboon statue. Yes. Fun day. Well, goodnight folks...or forks, whatever you prefer. Right now there's a ghost watching me. I can tell. It's Eric. You ever get that feeling sub conciously that someone is watching you but that person is an invisible ghost? Well I have that feeling right now, and that ghost is grabbing my legs from under my desk. Oh...stop that, that tickles....oh...ooooh...oh yes.
