I sure did, but of course since the producers were not licensed to kill they had to almost kill them by stripping them of all their cash in Egypt. I mean, when you’re not going to be going to the airport, and you’re in a poor country like this, how in the world are you going to get money other than being a night soil carrier?  So, the teams left the pit stop in Catherine’s Palace, and found that they had to take a train to St. Petersburg’s Hermitage museum. There they had to find Rembrandt’s “Return of the Prodigal Son”, something that sounds vaguely familiar. I kind of think I chanced upon it while doing my OM research, because Rembrandt is one of the registered artists in the problem. So anyway Chip  Kim took an extraordinarily long time to find the painting, while Colin  Christie started a leg of bickering by suggesting that the Prodigal Son was Jesus. I’m left wondering whether God neglected to give him any sense of general knowledge. In the meantime, Charla  Mirna, unlike all other teams who took cabs, “choo-chooed” their way to the train station on foot. A great display of Race skills was shown when she asked locals about the painting.         Once the teams found their painting, they found that they had to go to Cairo, Egypt, for this leg of the race. Chip  Kim stupidly rushed to the airport, while Colin  Christie, a pair that has proven to be apt at flight arrangements, walked to a travel agency. A travel agency is the place where they actually check all the airlines for the earliest flight. In airports, their access to flight information is limited, and most of the staff are too lazy to check thoroughly.  Kami  Karli were the only other team smart enough to go to a travel agency, but they were too late to catch Colin  Christie’s flight.  Colin  Christie came to the realization that they were on the earliest flight to Egypt, and the others had been duped by the Lufthansa lady. They had a stopover in Paris, for quite a number of hours, I presume, since they had time to find another flight. This flight, instead of 2.25pm, landed at 2.35 am, about 12 hours earlier than expected. They got to Egypt and the Tower of Cairo, but found it closed. The poor things had to sleep in the Egyptian streets. I mean, even the poor Egyptians don’t sleep on the streets, and they had to?!  All the other teams stopped over at Frankfurt, except Linda  Karen. They were found to be with the lying Lufthansa lady, who informed them it was possible to catch up in Frankfurt. She turned out not to be lying for a second time around, cause they really caught up. Meanwhile, in Frankfurt, cousins Charla  Mirna proved that they were too small to be noticed when they isolated themselves from the other teams to find better tickets out. It turns out that there was a better flight, and our little pink panthers, complete with the tiptoeing scene, left for the flight that landed 50 minutes earlier than the other. That scene, coupled with Lance stirring in his piggy-wiggy slumber, was one of the most hilarious scenes in TAR history.  In Cairo, Colin  Christie went up to the tower to find one of 2 “Fast Forwards” in the whole race. In a way it was a good option because there are only 2, and the likelihood of you using either would be pretty small. Might as well take a rest from 1 leg of the race. They had to carry this sarcophagus, one of those gold coffin thingys in the pyramids that you usually see in the movies, from somewhere to a temple. Colin was being a huge jerk by thinking he was so smart and not heeding Christie’s advice. In the end, Christie was right and they carried the thing to the temple. At the temple, Christie refused to shut her gap and wanted Colin to admit he was wrong. Bad move! I should know since my father’s a Colin (same name, same character…). When they reached the temple, Colin halted and started bickering. The priest started shaking his head in disapproval… Hey! These clue holders aren’t supposed to display emotion! Well anyway, I was hoping the priest tear up the clue in objection to their quarrelling in his temple, but he didn’t and sent Colin  Christie along to their pit stop, The Sphinx.         Colin  Christie arrived at the pit stop at 11.27am, and I have to fast forward 3 hours to when Charla  Mirna arrive. They go to the Tower of Cairo, and found that they had to go to the Giza plateau and follow the yellow rocks to their next clue. They went there, had a little trouble, and then finally got themselves to the Roadblock. From what I see, this was the most time consuming thing in this leg. It might have taken even longer than the Detour!         The Roadblock: one team member had to enter Osiris’ shaft and grab a artifact bag. Citing claustrophobia, Mirna asked Charla to go down. I’m left wondering what Mirna can do besides getting her team noticed at ticketing counters. Poor little Charla had to climb every single rung of the ladder because of her “littleness”, and after a while, with the bag as big as she was, she had to take little rests on the ladders. Those producers sure aren’t thinking too much about her still being in the race…         Anyway, Charla  Mirna were given a map as their next clue, coupled with the contents in the bag. Puzzling for a little while, they assembled the puzzle on the map and found the little hole that led them to their next location. They found the Detour as other teams started arriving at the Roadblock. Kami  Karli, however, were easily dumfounded by the puzzle. Not like they realize that the oval room in the white house doesn’t have corners…         The Detour this time involved Rock  Roll, and Hump  Ride. In Rock  roll, nice play on words to the producers, teams had to use an ancient method of transporting wooden blocks. Ball bearings in the form of logs were given beneath the stones and teams had to roll it, apparently across the length of a football field. It is, according to Phil, “physically demanding, but if you master the ancient art of rolling stones, it can be completed quickly.”         In Hump  Ride, which only Charla  Mirna arrived in time for, teams has to get on horses to guide camels with carpets on their bags to a carpet merchant. This task was entirely up to the moods of the horses, whether they went fast or not. I have a feeling with all those empathetic horse and camel rearers by Charla’s side, even helping her to get on the horse, they managed this task pretty fast.         And all the teams went to the pit stop, where the moms got last place. It isn’t a big surprise as there’s a Fast Forward. The producers wouldn’t want the Fast Forward to determine who gets eliminated, especially since they’re trying to downplay and eliminate the Fast Forwards. Anyway next week the mummies have to beg. Will they be wrapped up and sent into the tomb? I don’t think they would fit into one of those sarcophagus thingys!
