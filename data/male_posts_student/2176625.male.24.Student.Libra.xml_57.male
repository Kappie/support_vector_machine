A friend told me that no matter what the outcome of this situation is, my life will be forever changed and she's right. I've been worrying about my future. All the "what ifs" and questions. Les and I have been spending more time together. I'm worried she'll hurt me again.   These past 8 months of my life have been the hardest I've had to endure: Proposed to Leslie, she said no, we break up. My dad dies. Finally go on date with a certain lady friend I've been admiring since I met her, we get closer, I hoped to start something. Les and I reconcile then break up within a week. I get fucked up and have one night stand with Erin's best friend. Leslie comes out with the news that she is pregnant and there are two possible fathers, I'm one of them. I move from Spring Brook to Manhattan. Apply for grad school.   NOW WE WAIT FOR ANSWERS. Don't have unprotected sex, kids.   If this had happened 5 years ago, before I became a sensitive wuss, I would have been unfazed by it all.
