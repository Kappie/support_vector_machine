Well, I spend all of my sleeping time holding that pillow, so I figure if I can’t have him here, I will have my own thoughts about such event occurring.  And, btw I don’t and won’t rape pillows!  I am so pleased right now.     [Smoke me on though] After the national budget speech was made last week, a hard pack of 20 cigarettes costs another dollar more. Now, a Marlboro hard pack costs $3.50. (If you're frugal, this amount can cover lunch and dinner for 2 days and you might even have some money left over for a packet of mints.) My chain-smoking friend kindly informed me this after he had bought his daily bread. He also informed me that the taxes he pays for his ciggies practically put me through school. For those who don't know, all local students in state colleges receive tuition grants from the government well worth over $5,000 each. According to Stephie, who did an internship at British-American Tobacco Company last year, for every hard pack which costs about $3 plus (before the budget speech), $2 goes to the government. Now after the $1 increment, an average smoker who consumes 20 cigarettes a day pays at least $1000 more taxes annually than an average non-smoker. Fiscally, smokers on average contribute more to society than non-smokers. Not just taxes, you know. It has been found that most people caught littering in some states are smokers littering with their cigarette butts. Such offenders are also fined, I think, $100, yet another contribution to our national revenue. Moreover, smokers understand how increasing health costs, an aging population and falling fertility rates can be a weary burden on a nation's economy and government. By chain-smoking, smokers are sacrificing their healths, so that our future generations will be less burdened with caring for our grey population. Their social consciousness does not stop there. Since us non-smokers are so selfishly and hedonistically leading a longer and healthier life, and subsequently eating into the national budget, they try to kill us off with their secondhand smoke as well. So I asked my chain-smoking friend how I can repay him for smoking me through school, he simply selflessly says: " Just buy me cigarettes, just buy me cigarettes..."    Woohoo!  Gay Marriages in five states, six if you’re a lesbian: Oregan, New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and in San Francisco!  Lol, what now bitch?    So some boi e-mailed me about my site and it reads:   Will, I'm sure that you won't address my following questions because my take on your blog is that it is simply a forum to talk about things and not strive to honor God through the things you talk about.. However, I am very interested to know why you claim to carry the name of Christ but do not desire to talk in such a way that brings honor to His name? Side note: I find it very hard to believe that Jesus used any of the words that you use (i.e. s**t, hell, etc). Believe it or not, Jesus came to save us from hell and he would not be near as loose about throwing around that term as you seem to be. I do not mean any disrespect by these comments-- however, I firmly believe that it is time for you to reflect upon God's holiness and then you can teach people what you believe to be the truth concerning the Emerging culture. There is no doubt in my mind that God is not glorified by many of your statements. Maybe the fact is that your freedom is more important than your obedience!!!!   And in response I worte:   Jeff,  It is quite obvious to me that you are the one God has put on the earth to surf blogs and insure that His Holiness is preserved. At the same time I can’t help but note your tone, I think you are suppressing some feelings; I would encourage you to prayerfully consider your sexuality.  The rhythm of your words and the tone of your sentence structure leads me to believe you are fighting the urge to be attracted to people of your same sex. Please understand that I say this all with conviction in my heart and your best interest in my mind. May God Heal you of your suppressed homosexuality before it’s to late.  Forbid the day you fell in love with a man, and if that day never shall come then so be it.  Do understand that your concern for follow man is dearly noted, nut think about the message you are conveying.  God taught us to love all people and your actions are misplaced.
