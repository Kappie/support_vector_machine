Don't Forget Me                      By George Clarke  Fingers releasing from tender grips Words spoken by dying lips  Never can Never will Won't allow this Space to fill  Realisation comes and I start crying Tears begin to fall as you lay dying  Always loved Always envied Shot in the back By lying greed  I scream for help, mind begins to panic Blood flows away. So quick. So quick  Holding love Holding close Thinking thoughts Of who I'll miss the most  Help comes quick, as the blood runs cold "She'll be fine," or so I'm told  Thoughts flow Thoughts die Only now to think Only now to try  I'll hold our thoughts, our beliefs still true But for now all I can think, is how I'll miss you
