She is much older than me and requires some help getting around, but she still has a sharp mind.  She is one of the few people in town who I can talk forthrightly about philosophy and theology and who actually enjoys it!  Beverly also gives me advice for my love life and is constantly urging me to get married.  Back to my original story.  Yesterday, I took Beverly to a doctor’s appointment and then we went to lunch.  She was a little afraid that she might undergo some pain at the doctor’s, but thankfully she did not.  In fact, she seemed to be in much better health and spirits than I have seen her in a long time.  Beverly has been a source of encouragement and joy here in Abilene, which has been a cauldron of despair for me in the past.  I will miss my days with Beverly, especially since I know she is a one of a kind.
