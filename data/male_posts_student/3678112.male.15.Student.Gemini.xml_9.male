This is a review from E3: A brief cinematic featuring G-Man fades into gameplay of Gordon Freeman stepping off of yet another train and into a processing station in a disturbing, dystopian world. After being led into a sinister interrogation room with a blood-soaked restraint chair, the scene changes to a dune buggy-like vehicle racing along a cliffside road, trying to avoid some sort of spherical attack bots. This is followed by a firefight with the stormtrooper-looking enemy soldiers, an arachnid tank and yet more vehicular combat in a gully.
