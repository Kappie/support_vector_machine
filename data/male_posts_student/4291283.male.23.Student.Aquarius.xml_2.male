(0151HRS 210804)  Erm what shud I write... i never had an online blog before... just plain ol notepad files during my 'nervous' year when i fell in love with a girl... it was great to write something when u're feeling nervous... trust me... it really worked... instead of punching the wall or doing other stupid things that cud damage ur body... why don't u write... write, swear, cry, plead... yes u can do it all...  So my purpose to publish my 'diary' online? Just to experience others thought about my writing skills... maybe at the same time i desperately need all the help that i cud find... or maybe just a motivation for others... i got free access to the net n why dont i use it?... :)  Life had been so great... i loved a girl... and she loved me back... can u ask for more? We had a really great days in our lives... some might say, during the early months being a couple, everything was great... i tend not to believe that... i dare to challenge that short-minded theory... i'll make sure that i am happy everyday... and my girl...  Financial? Well... i had to extend my studies in the U n i had to apply for loan extension... rite now, my capital was limited... n rite now also, i started to believe that it was terribly difficult to earn a dollar... i started to follow my budget instead of only planning... today, tomorrow n a day after, my U has a convocation ceremony and we have this sort of fair... everthing is available... and cheap... n i don't have my money for it... aaa wat a life... i had to wait... really had to...  Studies? Erm... 1 semester n 1 subject... no exams... no tests... no pop quiz... no finals... just doing some fabricationg works for my Final Year Project... too much free time brings too much comfort... n too much comfort making me lazier everyday...  Owh its already 2am and my eyes are half-opened... tomorrow i have a breakfast with my lovely cute girl... n on the evening, i'll be left solo coz she's going to meet her friend for 2 days... how on earth can i spend 2 days without her? i got half-read Sheldon's Bloodline... ultra-panic-yet-horror Doom 3... Full MEtal Alchemist anime... so i can make myself busy i guess... while waiting desperately for my girl to return... yeah i have this blog also... i'll write something tomorrow...  Okey... i'm asking my girl to have a look at my first entry... n i'll ask her comment via irc... (yeah we chatted 19/7 a day... 4 hours sleeping)... ciao  To Rozie - I love you with all my heart!
