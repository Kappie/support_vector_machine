Unless ol' Georgie suddenly whips out the "No Personal Contact Unless You're Married" ammendment I don't think the NPCA (No Personal Contact Agency) is going to start enforcing (or even exist for that matter) this rule. Although, that would be funny. I can see Dubya trying to explain it in one of the debates. There he is, squinty eyes and all, looking like he is staring into the sun and all the while he has that stupid grin... and then his ears start wiggling when he (thinks he) gets something right. "Ummmmm... this new ammendement of mine... is meant to... ummm... stop personel contact unless your [intentional] married with someone of the opuesta, as the spanish say,  sex (by this time, they have passed the same sex amendment). We think... ummm... Damn, I forgot what Dick told me to say... Damn, I can't believe that I just ummm... said that... Oh yeah, we think that it will stop people from... I didn't inhale... Damn... Bill got off on that..."
