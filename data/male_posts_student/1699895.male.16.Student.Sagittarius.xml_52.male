We kept asking them if they wanted to change the teams because we were killing them so bad.  Then we gave them Brian,  and that evened things out a bit.  All in all, it was great fun.  Spent the night at mur's and worked with his dad in the morning. It turned out, he was selling everything he didn't want, because he was moving, so we had a yard sale.  Doug is so funny when he sells stuff.   so anyways, I went back to drews and napped. Went back to see if Doug needed anything, and he gave me an Andy Griffth box set to give to my mom for mothers day. So that was kinda cool.  From there I went straight to bens to practice.  That was fun. Everyone there likes the little kitten, chu chu charly.  Spencer drove me back to drews because I thought drew was going to the jewelry store with his dad, and then just cancels his plans without telling me -_-' so he was at grant playing hockey.  so i was like fuck, i had some time to spare, so spencer and I went to westland mall to play the arcades, went back to my house to get my amp, then over to phils to practice, but they were getting wasted (as usual? don't know) so i just went back home.  today looks nice out, but i don't think it will last.  i gotta go buy a book for sci-fi and then practice at bens again, but im hungry right now, so im going to munch on something consumable, later.
