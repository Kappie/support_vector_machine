I want to thank you for flying with us today and I hope you enjoy your stay in Toronto".   He forgets to switch off the intercom, and the whole plane can hear his conversation with his co-pilot.   The copilot says to the pilot,  "Well, skipper, watch a gonna  do in Toronto?"   "Well," says the skipper,  "first I'm gonna check into the  hotel and take a big crap . . . . .then I'm  gonna take that  new stewardess with the huge tits out for dinner . . . . .   then I'm gonna wine and dine her, take her back to my room  and put it to her big time all night long!"   Everyone on the plane hears this and  immediately begins  looking up and down the isles trying to get a look at the new stewardess. Meanwhile the new stewardess is at the very  back of the  plane. She's so embarrassed that she tries to  run to the cockpit to turn the  intercom off. Halfway down  the aisle, she trips over an old lady's bag and  falls on  her face.  The old lady leans over and says: "No need to hurry,  dear.  He's gonna take a shit  first."
