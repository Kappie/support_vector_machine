I got home tonight from visiting family in Denver, fun fun.  I went to check my mail (snail mail) and got my first reply back from one of the law school's I applied to.  I GOT IN!  WOO!  I'm ecstatic.  Somehow I feel like the work and effort was not in vain now.    I'm definitely not naive enough to think that all the letters I get will be acceptance letters, but WOW what a great feeling to know that if I want to,  I can go to law school!  I tend to have a that lingering fear that no matter what, everyone else is more qualified, I have no business applying to law school, I'll never get in, admissions committees will laugh at me, etc.  This was a huge boost.  My first reply.. and it's an acceptance.  It isn't my TOP choice in school/location, but it's a thrilling feeling to get my first reply and have it be an acceptance.  *sigh* I feel very relieved to know that I can go to law school now.  (thanks for sharing in my joy and allowing me to have that moment, I'm very much smiling still at this present time).   On a different note (yet still related to academics):  I'm skipping school tomorrow.  It's official, I've already decided.  I will not be going to class tomorrow because fankly, Scarlet, I hate International Marketing anyway.   So have you heard about the chicken flu?  Yeah, apparently there's chickens and they have the flu, and they're Asian, and they're gonna spread it to humans if we're not careful and it could be worse than the Plague and Joan River's plastic surgery COMBINED!  Yes, that bad.  I don't so much feel like being killed off by a CHICKEN flu would be my idea of a credible way to die for anyone.  How do these things come about anyhow?  One day a chicken goes outside without his rain booties on, his webbed feet get cold, and he develops a cough?  *BAM* Next thing you know, 50 million people are sneezing because one guy in Taiwan let his pet chicken sneeze on him.  I hate that guy.  First he spread SARS, now he's letting his chicken give everyone the flu.  I think it's high time we come up with a flu to send over to that side of the world.  Maybe like.. hamster flu or something.  They're always developing something in the throws of their dirty society, ridin' around on their rickshaws, wearing surgical masks, stuffing themselves into subways, and boarding planes to LAX while carrying viruses with them.  I say.. lets give them Hamster-Pox.    Why did the chicken cross the road?  To get away from the hamster-pox virus... k, I'm worthless for writing anything that makes sense, it's late.  NITE!
