Ok last sunday had lawn bowls competition in the morning, one word describes it "disastrous", totally off form and couldnt concentrate. Boy was i glad when it was finally over, aniwaes after that went to meet my folks for lunch. Went home and took a nap, super tired. Then i managed to study a bit for chinese. IN the evening went to meet my friend for dinner, ate at bk cineleisure.After that we went bowling, i finally realised that u are not supposed to throw the ball but instead roll it, thats why i bowled so lousyily in the past. Anyway had loads of fun, played 3 games and at the same time burned a hole in my pocket, finally went home around 2300.  Monday studied a bit in the morning for chinese, its like its the subject that i am least prepared for. After that in the afternoon went to meet jansen and his pals.In the process, i asked them to do so surveys for my pw. watched spiderman 2 which was super cool and fascinating. Its better than the first one in my opinion, the hero really has grown and matured. AH that ends officially the holidays, as on tuesday its back to school  Tuesday basically had chinese in the morning, my water bottle was confiscated by the teacher, was SUPER ANGRY as i was very thristy, had to bear with it for like 3 hours, Joel my classmate was unfortunate..his english chinese dictionary was confiscated.. hopefully he managed to use it before that happened. IN the afternoon had NE quiz, quite hilarious some of the questions.After that had oral exams for chinese AO, was alrite in my opinion, finally went home to catch some sleep.  From wed to thurs i was practically slacking at home after school not even touching my homework. I still feel as if it was the holidays.. argh cant believe its term already..everyday go home play comp..still trying to dload gundam seed..  Friday finally i managed to grab gundam seed after a tip off from one of my friends. THere was a council investiture and a very entertaining youth day concert..BLar after school went to town....but with no one!!!!!!! why cant i fit into a group!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I REALLY MISS THE FIRST 3 MONTHS.. oh well, the good thing was i had some quiet time to myself. Tried eating some freezed dried food from 7 eleven, after that met bingshan, one of the lawnbowlers and went to kallang for training, along the way we were crapping about the upcoming exam results..
