But then I stopped and thought how could  something so unreal could be so caring and beautiful... Then I realized you were not someone from a fairy tale, whose beauty and personality knows no bounds... you're a dream come true...         We had our class outreach a while ago, and it was great. Most of the were very kind and hospitable and the whole trip was ok. But I kind of feel fortunate. While I'm here bitching about stuff I don't have, poor people are ok with their lives even though they are unfortunate. It kinda makes me feel terrible. The whole purpose of the outreach program finally came to me after that experience, and I think it did to my other classmates too...   Right now, I'm listening to a Woodstock CD. And I can't believe the sounds coming out of our computer's speakers! Jimi Hendrix was playing his guitar like it was an extension of his arm! Arf said sarcastically that in a a couple of years, he could become better than Jimi Hendrix. But I think that's downright impossible... nobody can be better than Jimi Hendrix! It's a shame he died young because of some "magic powder"...  The other day on the bus, I heard "Take Me Out" by Franz Ferdinand and it rocked! While listening o the song, thoughts like "How did they come up with this?" and "Is this for real?". I can't write songs for squat, while all the bands come up with such great songs and it just makes me wonder... Will I ever get this good? I know I'm still young but I've got dreams of making it as a music artist but I don't think I can. I've tried making tunes and some lyrics but everything that I compose usually ends up in disaster as far as I'm concerned. Maybe I just need more time...  That's it for my second post... I hope whoever is reading found it ok.
