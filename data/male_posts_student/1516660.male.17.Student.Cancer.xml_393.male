Isn't that horrendous? Imagine! Sleeping while water is running all over you? Ergo!   Right. After that, I set on the ardous task of gelling my hair. Now, I wouldn't care to gel my hair. However, Miss Ong said she wanted a clean forehead, meaning no fringes. Sigh. You wanna know how long I took? Half an hour! My stomach was grumbling like mad already! I tried to make my hair all stand up, but I look like a freak. I can't do the flat top, because the rest of the back hairs are in a weird crazy pattern. Sigh. I even called CQ and Gloria to ask for advice. In the end, I did a center-parting thingy. HaHa. Oh well!  Right. I grabbed a box of Porky Strawberry sticks and ran out of the house to meet Gloria. O.O!!! It's about to rain! Such horrid weather in a morning! Atrocious! Luckily for me and Gloria, the downpour started after we went into the MRT station. Ain't we lucky or what?   Okay. We met CQ on the train, blah blah blah and arrived to school slightly wet. We have to trek across the open road, in such torrential conditions! Even ducks meow at not being wet!   After waiting for so long (for lotsa people), we finally set off at 8. Heh Heh. I slept on the journey, listening to Boon Chai's discman (I slept after Cindy's Ai Ni. I have to thank Wendy for 'introducing' me to that song. Who wouldn't get addicted if you have to listen to the song everytime you visit Wendy's blog? HaHa!).  I meow and moo! We went in there, and assembled lor. We rehearsed first. That Alvin ar. Such a joker. HaHa. He reminds me of Vincent, really. His friends tell me he's an attention-seeker and he actually asked "What's your name" today? Horribe reminder of that lunatic. Alvin's not that bad la. At least he knows when to be serious, can sing well and is humorous. Heh Heh.  Right. There's a break. Oh my! The boys are forced to apply blusher on our faces. HaHa. I ended up quite red la. Well, not really red. I joked that it's like hou zi pi gu (monkey's butt), something that XiaoYanZi would say often. HaHa! Not bad la. HaHa.   Okay. It's finally our performance! Ayioh...such a short performance. I kept smiling though. Once, it wasn't my turn to sing, so I was smiling at Miss Ong. I was so engrossed in smiling that I came in late for a part! HAHAHA! Anyhoo, I think we did rather well. So soon over le! We prepared for so long, so xin ku. Only came to perform for about 10 minutes. Like the ancient Chinese proverb: tai shang yi fen zhong, tai xiao shi nian gong (one minute on stage is equivalent to ten years preparation down the stage)!! Yes! Even ducks were meowing!   Okay. After our performance (gaining thunderous applause :P), we sat down at the back rows. I really felt like sleeping. Luckily, I know my decorum and did not sleep. HaHa! The ChannelNewsAsia camera man actually came to my row and started fliming leh. There I was, left leg over right leg, the booklet showing who's getting what awards open in my lap. When the camera started filming my row, I tried to be as proper as possible and looked at the big screen while applauding politely at those getting the bursaries. HaHa! How fake! Why my row of all rows? Heh!   Okay. After the awards, we had the reception. O.O! I totally pigged out! I ate so much chai tau kueh (carrot cake) and keep on grabbing more drumsticks! Let me tell you, their drumsticks is to die for! I think I took about 6! Oh my god! Such heavenly drumstick! After that, I took more fruits. HaHa! Wintermelon, watermelon, grapes and even dates! I am such a glutton! Yes!! I didn't get to drink tea though, 'cause CQ and Gloria wants to go off le. Sigh! My tea!!  Okay. After that we went to Orchard to go to Kinokuniya! Finally! I can spend my vouchers. Okay. I stand corrected. The vouchers CQ gave me. Yep. I spent it on "Tuesdays With Morrie" and I even have to come out with 70cents. HaHa. What a nice book!  Okay. After that, I met Kelvin at Admiralty MRT, while he passed stuff to me. I went back, bathed and made minutes. HaHa. So tiring. I even fell asleep for a couple of hours.   So tiring sia! Even ducks were meowing! Okay. I think I going le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
