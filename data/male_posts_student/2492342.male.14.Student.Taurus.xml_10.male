I DDINT SHOW YOU!!!! conversation from last night-   maybe she wants you to love her and only her, not aisha or whatever  i think so, she was kind of jealous that u talked about aisha alot to her or something? she thinks your in love with aisha and shes jealous, she wants you to like her  hm, what to make of it? A friend of mine told em maybe thats what's going on. I changed some of it though, so it didnt sound like the person. It could screw something im working on.   Yes, oi.   AT lunch, the weirdest conversation. me, crystal, rina, and andrea were sitting at a table in middle school, and somehow we get into their first time having a period. Then into all these stories about what dad said..  ONE STORY- FUNNY STUFF....'my brothers came into the room and they were like whatre you doing? and my dad was all, -censor- cna have babies now.' LOL!!!! isnt that great?  another...'i was in guatemala city...and my sister tells me to go to the bathroom alone, cause i ahd a period, in like thsi mall. So, im going, and these three guys start following me. so i go in this store, and try to say in broken spanish that these guys were following me, but since i took french they told me to go away. so they kept following me, and i ran onto a street and all these people were honking at me cause i was white and wearing a mini skirt. SO im like crying in the street until I finally lose the guys..but i get lost. SO after all this time i get back to my sister, still with my period.'  wow. thats great. lol...  yes, that was odd. and dads asking girls what kidn of tamposn they wanted.   THANK GOD im not a girl. I mena, the p-nis gets annoying, but its better than having blood come out of some random hole. Poor girls...  Yes. Whate else happened today...I GETT TO WAKE UP LATE TOMORROW!! im ditching PE...and i go home early, for a free period. i dont know if i want to tho, i mean i wont see anyone. Ill see if i do....I might just relax the last period in joyful bliss. and then say bye to manny and crap. or have sex with her.  and brightons gone, but thats ok.  aishas here. sort of. ill call her for sure tomorrow night..maybe stay up til 4 again.  Theres something between us. she obviously doesnt get it. I mena..something we're not talking about. i know she was hesitant when i told her to send something on her pic phone. She thought yeah. But i dont know if shes still thinking about it. I mean, i want ehr to, but i dont. I mena, what do I have to show for myself? yeah..  oh yeah, just to see if anyoen else reads besides aisha, email me at arspickles@aol.com for repsonses. lol. i expect one..AISHA!!!!!!  much love  peace  ~alex
