According to our conductor, 2 musicians in the audience thought we were quite brilliant in 2 songs that were rather difficult, and everyone loved the second half with pop songs and christmas carols...so if you missed it, well too bad...th audience also clapped at the correct time for once.  During the period of two hours just b4 the concert i was rushing out the concert poster backstage...it was quite a killer i tell you. Forst in the morning and afternoon must go to marine parade to a photo shop to print the poster out and must pay 20 bucks for that...then later rush to mph and popular to buy decorations for the poster, which will be placed at the door. Another 20 bucks there. Then later rush to VCH to do the poster. he mounting board was too big so must cut, then cut until very ugly somemore, cos i only had a lousy thin pen knife. The later paste poster on, add ribbons leaves and whatever, i was sooooooo happy when i finally finished it. They liked it alot, so it was worth it. So all the CCAs out there, send at least one of your members to the art club, you will need him sooner or later lol.   Later after the concert met rich and dezhi and zhaoyu backstage, then went to eat with them and liansheng at cafe cartel. Ate until around 1145 to 12, played truth or dare, lots of secrets revealed....no details, i am sworn to secrecy...too bad louis weren't there...ask him to go dun go....nvm next time? hahaz. Cannot grill him. Then later must rush to catch the last train. so cham. Reached home 1230 to 1 am...lol  Yersterday went to cousins wedding...got alot more coming up. This is the third wedding i attended his year...got bout 3 more coming up lolx. All my cousins getting married....arghz.
