I found out after depositing one of my coins into the subway-turnstile-coin-taking-thing, that really, one of them was a quarter.  So, a little upset that I just lost a quarter, I deposited my token and went to campus.  Once I finally got to the gym, I found out that all the rental lockers are full.  I spotted pay lockers (different from the rental ones) thak take a quarter to work.  My mind raced back to the quarter i had lost this morning (i realize that i didn't mean to bring the quarter in the first place, but had I deposited my actual token instead of the quarter, i might have found that quarter in my time of need.  Already cold and grumbling from my excursion to the bursar's office, i happened to look down on the ground, and there is a shiny quarter at my feet, like the universe put it there just for me, following some conservation of lost quarters law.  and the best part is, that after my workout, I found out that the lockers give you the quarter back when you return the key!!
