SO i figured DDR, so of course as teh universe hates me, my first guess is always wrong. We had to go return it. Then we install everything. Test the burner. ALL goes well. Restart the computer and......windows xp cant load the profile, we will give you this new TEMPORARY profile. 10 restarts, a virus check, and another few restarts and it still cant load it. So we start transfering all old data to this NEW TEMPORARY profile, and it messes up again. It start auto restarting, 1 hour and a half later it stops and it works perfect. THen the DSL modem has to be reistalled. FINALLY. I wanted to go online at noon. Its now 10 o'clock and i jsut got on. DAMN YOU TINYSOFT.
