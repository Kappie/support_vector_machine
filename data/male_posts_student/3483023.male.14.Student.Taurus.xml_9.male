I Was Informed From My Dad What We Are Doing For The Next Few Weeks, Boring! I Guess This Saturday I Get To Go The A Rodeo, I Am Not Excited About That Really, But I Am Excited About Seeing My Cousins. I Haven't Seen Them In Over A Month, Kinda Miss Them! Ok.... I Am Anxious On Getting My Report Card Because If I Get Straight A's I Get A Lap Top (aka Notebook), So That Is Why I Am Massivly Over Concerned About My Report Card, I'm Not Crazy..... I Promise! I Am Almost Positive I Will Get Straight A's But Like Any One Else Would Be.... I Am Nervous! I Am  Almost  Positive It Will Come In The Mail Tomorrow, But With My Luck, It Won't....Always Can Hope!
