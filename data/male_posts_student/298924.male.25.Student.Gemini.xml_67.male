There was a video on as I was flipping past that abomination of a channel and I had to flip back to make sure my eyes had not deceived me....what I saw was worse than Mr. Dalvin's video....  The song was "What That Thang Smell Like" by Black Jesus....people I wish I was making this up....this is why we ain't going no where....Viacom's idea of "Black Entertainment Television" just keeps getting lower and lower....  I'm taking two shots of scotch and going to bed....maybe all of this will be a dream and I'll wake up tomorrow with Andrew Young as the president of the United States....
