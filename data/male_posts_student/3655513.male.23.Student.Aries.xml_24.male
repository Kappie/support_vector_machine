I don't even know that I like the interface that much, and although the "search" bit of the program certainly seems clever, it can be annoying too. Wish I could turn it off. Still. I have the 2 gmail addresses that I really want reserved for me, and me alone. That's gotta be something right?  As usual, people were just about desperate to display their power, and by surfing and posting on www.gmailswap.com I managed to get one bozo to email me an invite for nothing whatsoever, and actually found out that one of my coworkers had invites, and I ended up with another account via him.  So can you believe it? The hottest invite on the net and in the space of one morning, I score two? Maybe I'm right. Maybe an invite is just not something to fuss about. *laugh*  Then again, it could end up revolutionizing Life, The Universe and Everything...  Rooster.
