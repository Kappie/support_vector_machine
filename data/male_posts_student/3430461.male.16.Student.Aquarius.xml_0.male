My dad's started his marking well and proper now, so I'm scuppered for using the comp. Ho hum.  Had a brass day yesterday. It was okish. Erm. Not really much to say. Saw lots of people who knew other people who I know. Very confusing.  It's a small world... Yum tee tumty.  My brother came home yesterday evening, and so we're going out for a slap-up meal. In the meantime I'm supposed to be revising  cough cough . Oh well. I really do write  oh well  too much don't I? Oh well.  That's about it really for today. Can't be bothered to write much more.  Tatty bye.
