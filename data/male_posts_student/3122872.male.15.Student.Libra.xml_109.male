You don't want to tell them the whole story of the film and how the whole thing went when you want them to pick you up from standing in the bloody rain.  Also, a note to Emma, after discussion and deliberation, I have decided to laugh off your death threat as something done when somebody is greatly deprived of something. Haha  Simon - Look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone (Jet)
