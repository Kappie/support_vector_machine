Lol i think some people may have had more than their fair share of booze aswell. Some people really cant pace it when it comes to drinking, no names mentioned but they know who they are :) I feel kinda happy today must be the booze still in my system lol.  ALso i have had alot of support from people who talk to household appliances, theres alot of u guys and i would like to thank you for making me feel accepted :)  Yawnypoos i been kinda messed up in the head these last couple of days realising stuff i didn't before some of it is quite nice even though it might be kinda stupid to other people. I don't care thought its what i wanna do not other people.  Anyways i thought i better update this for the sake of it cuz no1 reads this :(  Tom
