Don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing that balance is bad in all cases, I just think that in many cases where journalists are called upon to draw conclusions they tend to either back off or draw a conclusion that treats both left and right in a balanced way even when the facts don't support such a conclusion. Three quick examples are the article above, science coverage in general (though particularly on global warming, and for more of which see  urlLink Chris Mooney's blog , and coverage of supply-side economic theories. The way it usually goes in (natural or social) science coverage is a he said/she said type article, even when the vast majority of scientists thinking about an issue come down strongly on one side or the other. This mentality even extends to policy questions, where most reporting fails to explain what the results of a particular policy would most likely be, rendering it almost useless to ponder the outcome of policy, since most of the public doesn't have the information or background knowledge to accurately estimate. And admittedly sometimes we don't know, but we do have at least some decent idea more often than not, and reporters often know. The trouble is that balance isn't really a primary virtue we should expect of our press; we should ask, first of all, that stories represent a best-effort attempt to report the truth. Sometimes this means being balanced and sometimes it doesn't, and while I'm all for an honest attempt to be unbiased and evenhanded, I have to think that truth beats balance every time.  How to fix it? I think reporters striving to report the truth (and being willing to take the criticism for it) more than they do now would be going a long way, and I hope that the emergence of better lefty media criticism will help (brave reporters at least) do just this. There are some mechanisms I could propose, but the best first step is just to ask for truth over balance.  Update: Just when I think it's safe to speak my mind, Chris Mooney  urlLink posts  something directly on point; apparently the AP is dissecting stem-cell spin in stories, certainly a truth-seeking step in the right direction.
