AGH that stuff sucks. but showers after exercising the crap out of yourself feel so good.  three things you need: the BEAUTIFUL  urlLink google deskbar , which murders the google toolbar (except it doesn't have pop-up killing), and some of these cool windows xp professional  urlLink powertoys . alt-tab replacement, tweak ui (tweak your computer), and power calculator are pretty damn helpful. also, you can kill spyware with lavasoft's free  urlLink ad-aware  program.  nobody really wants to know this but i'm just gonna compare what i like about this year and last year for my own personal benefit. and if you don't wanna see...too bad, this is my blog!! i like quantifying things. hahahahkakaka...yup...   sophomore year  talked to more people more involved in school/class stuff classes were easy as crap (geometry) and had fun people (chem!) talking about weekend in mr o's class (wait, no, somebody in our class ruined it) and block walks cool teachers (mr. o, lott sometimes, losson) no history notes! sdfkljdklsfj   junior year  more fit and athletic (BADMINTON) better at mandarin more time to myself (aka talking to less people) challenging classes (chem, mandarin 3 kinda, calculus) getting ok at drawing following nfl and nba more  but almost nothing beats hanging out with your best friends...even if you don't really do anything fun.
