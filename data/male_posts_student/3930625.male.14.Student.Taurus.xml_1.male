Saul was almost six, but he kept his nerve and remained silent.  He felt cold inside, unaware of the cold loneliness of death.  Saul crept closer to the barely opened door, just out of Sokal's sight.  Shock fired through him.  He began to sweat.  His mother and his brother were lying next to each other in a pool of blood.  Saul stepped back and tripped over himself, hitting the floor with a loud sound.  Sokal stepped slowly out of the room and looked at Saul lying helpless on the ground. "What did you see!?"  He questioned as Saul looked up to the towering preacher. "I-I"  He stammered as Sokal lifted his blood-drenched knife. "What did you"-The doorbell rang.  Fear defied his ambition as he stared at the door.  He then turned to Saul with a glare of defeat, "I will come back for you little boy.  I will receive what I came here for, even if it takes years.  I will return for your blood . . ." He the slid into the shadows and left.  The doorbell rang again, neglecting Saul's vulnerable emotions.  So he stood up and opened the door, it was Jackie his brother's girlfriend. "Hey Saul, is your brother home?" She asked as she noticed the grim look on his face, "what's wrong?" "He's dead." 	Saul stared down into the grave of his mother just as the preacher ended his prayer.  All the people dressed in black began to slowly leave.  Then a man Saul was not familiar with walked up to him.   	"Saul, I'm John, one of your mom's friends.  Listen, since both your parents have passed away a nice old man has decided to adopt you." 	Then an older gentleman came up to them, "You don't think I'm that old do you?  Sure I'm not as young as I used to be but, well . . . ah never mind."  He then looked at Saul, "hello there young man, my name is Geoff Moore.  I have invited you into my home, since you don't have anyone to stay with and I wouldn't want you to get lonely" 	          Sokal did not attend church that Sunday, or the next.  He disappeared.
