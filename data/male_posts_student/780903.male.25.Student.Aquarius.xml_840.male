I won the first round pretty handily (thanks to anyone who voted); I don't feel all that compelled to win any more rounds, because I feel pretty stupid asking someone to vote in round after round after round.  So the link is there but don't worry about it; if you're going to spend 10 seconds devoting your goodwill to me, I'd rather you e-mail me to say you like what I write or you e-mail a friend and tell them to read my site than you go vote in another round of this thing.  I mean, go vote if you want, but don't feel like I will be at all bothered if you don't.   urlLink voting link .  (And if you go vote, you should probably read the other guy's post and make sure you like me more, just to be fair...)
