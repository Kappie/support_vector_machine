Hmm, guess he's not home yet. *sighzZ* I guess he's not going to Bethel tonight. So much for hanging out with him at Bethel. I miss him so much...  Julie told me that one of her friends like Nima. Whoever's reading this blog of mine, please DO NOT say anything or I will seriously lose my fuckin trust in you! I promised to not say anything about it! So basically, this is in my online DIARY which nobody is allowed to say anything about. I know which friend of hers likes Nima but I'm not allowed to mention names. Julie asked me for Nima's picture so that her friend could have it. Yeah right. Nooo way! MY PICTURES! Muahahaha! A grade 6 kid likes my guy... hmm... should I consider this competition? LoLzZ~! Blah. JokingzZ~!  I love him so much. I love Nima. I don't like him, I love him. There's a difference. I'm so afraid of losing him and stuff... I trust him a lot more now. Seriously.   I can't wait until the Sudbury trip. It's gonna be so much fun! Especially because Nima's there. The dance thing is now CASUAL instead of SEMI-FORMAL. Damn the people who voted for casual! Joking~ But yeah... I like semi-formal a lot better. Its more fun! You get to dress up a little nicer than you do usually. *sighzZ* No telephone calls after 11pm [lights out]. I wanna talk to Nima on the phone before I go to bed... hee hee~ I'll have to call my mommy too. I wonder if long distance calls are allowed... I might call my daddy in HK.   Like I said before, I really don't think Nima knows how much I love him. When I tell him I love him, I want him to know that I really do mean it. I'd do ANYTHING for him. If he wanted me to, I'd even get over my fear of insects for him! Anything at all. I love him. Love beyond description.   I don't know how much Nima loves me but I know who loves me more than even my parents. GOD. He loves me even more than anyone! If I am tired, He'd listen to my whining. If I'm angry, He listens to my complaints and cussing. If I'm hurt, He heals me. If I have a broken heart, He'd be there to comfort me. When you break up, you might not always feel comfortable going to your parents, so you go to God. When you fall and injure yourself, you might not like your parents fussing over you like a baby... so God heals you. When you feel bad for something you've done, you ask God for forgiveness and it shall be given to you. Praise the LORD.  Since Nima's still out, I guess he's not going to Bethel... I'm gonna miss him so much. Last time, I didn't go to Bible Study because Nima wasn't going and I'd rather be at home than elsewhere with other people. So I skipped Bethel last time... I don't know if Nima's going to Bethel 'cos he might not have time for dinner if he's still out... so I guess I'm just gonna go this time. No more ditching God for Nima. God SHOULD BE my #1 priority. No more ditching God for anything.  I'm sorry LORD for the thing I've made it... but when it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus. I'm coming back to the heart of worship... but when it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus."  If Nima doesn't come, then whatever. I'll see him on Monday. I'm going to Bethel tonight, and there's no stopping me. Even if Nima's gonna call my house while I'm at Bethel. I ain't gonna wait for his phone calls anymore. Just gonna chillax with God. :)
