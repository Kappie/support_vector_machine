All download URL's that require to be password protected can be stored in the directory "downloads" in the "logexun" directory on the FTP server.  I understand not everyone has access to the FTP server. But indirectly (through blogger) you guys can upload material into the directory. Just make sure, it's "logexun/downloads" in Blogger.  For example  urlLink http://logexun.exunclan.com/downloads/MYFILE.DOC  (yeah, logexun.exunclan.com works just like exunclan.com/logexun) is not accessible without the password, but after you've supplied a correct password, you're on your way to downloading the file.  A PHP solution to this password protected thing is  urlLink http://logexun.exunclan.com/download.php?url=http://logexun.exunclan.com/downloads/MYFILE.DOC   For those interested, the  urlLink PHP source  is also available.  Hail to the Power of PHP.
