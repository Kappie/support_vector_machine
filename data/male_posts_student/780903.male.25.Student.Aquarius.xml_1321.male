The quality of your work has suffered, but you don't care.  3. You arrive consistently late to work.  8. You don't have enough work to keep busy, but lack motivation to seek new assignments.  9. Time drags and you constantly watch the clock. Presented without comment, suitable for forwarding to your friends in jobs they hate.
