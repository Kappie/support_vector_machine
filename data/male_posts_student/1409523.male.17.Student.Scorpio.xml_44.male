HOLY CRAP.... i was most definitely floating through the school day today... its not good when you have spurts of zoning out... only to realize that you ACTUALLY are at school... i felt like i was meditating or something... like i had just reached enlightenment only without all the holy monk stuff... seriously i felt very disconnected from my body and mind.... just like i said, kind of floating.... but anyways i definitely FAILED school today .. in the figurative sense of the word... i was sucking all around... two quizzes.. oh yeah... sure i could concentrate .. oh wait.. me concentrate... i dont think so.... but all is said and done and that is behind me now.. so i think im going to start my hw early tonight and get to bed earlier... i dont think i am going to swing either... if i did im sure i would have some sort of epilectic seizure... pass out and die...
