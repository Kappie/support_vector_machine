It isn't even done being built yet. Construction is scheduled to finish sometime in August, but my parents are still leaving in July and will stay in a hotel until its done. The concern they have about that is what to do with Vickie. I have a feeling she will be staying here, but my hope is that Sue (my Dad's co-worker and Vickie's former owner) will take her in.  The house is 2 stories plus a basement, with the top floor being a decent sized loft. The basement that is the full size of the house. There are two bedrooms with the loft acting as a third. There is also a kitchen with a dinette and a separate dining room, living room, two walk-in closets, and a two car garage. It comes with a real porch in the front of the house and their new association will pay for all gardening and water. There's also a country club nearby that my Mom has already had lunch in.  So progress continues in this tumultuous process. This means Patti and I are one step closer to living together. :) Oh yeah - my parents will have to buy a new stove, but Patti and I get to keep the microwave. Probably for a garage sale.
