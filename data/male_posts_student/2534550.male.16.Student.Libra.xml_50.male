But anyways I'm sitting here in digital media and I'm supposed to making a cd cover but once again I turn to my blog when things get a little boring.   Well lets see doesnt seem like there is much to write about but I will find something. Im sitting here and I have know music at all. If you went to my school you would find it near impossible to do work without music because the sound of computers keys are really annoying once you've heard it many times. So without my music comes no work. And its dawned on me that since I have about 2 weeks to finish this project I'm actually pretty well on track. And it helps that I am pretty good with photoshop so im not to worried.   What does seem to make me mad is that I dont feel that I can miss school ever. I mean dont you feel that it is a right of passage to randomly be sick and just not come that day? At this school we dont need passes or notes or anything to make our way around the school. But it seems that whenever I have an ample opportunity to leave (which is always) I never take it and I do my work. This may perhaps be the reason I dont get anything below a B but I think im now going to excercise my right more and take my chances. How much harder can it be?  But not today because today we find out our rolls for the new project. What we're doing in my American Studies Class (intergrated english and history) is we're going to be staging a trial. There will be no lines or anything that you dont really go into a court case with. If im lucky ill become a prosecutor for the Atomic Bomb case. Which means I get to charge the US with the mass murder of many Japanese civilians. (fun fun) Im really excited although my teacher said that if I am lawyer then it will be the most work that i'll ever have to do up to and quite possibly through my college career. This should scare me but I think of it like this. If I can get through this with an A. I might possibly get though the rest of my years in high school with A's always thinking "This can't compare to that America On Trial Project" So im pretty excited.  Well I think im gonna get back to work now this may not be the last blog considering its only 8:54 arg another hour in this class. Well Payce
