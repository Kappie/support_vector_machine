Motivation is becoming somewhat low (a lot of things are weighing on my mind), which is probably not such a good thing. I mean that's why I started my other blog. so i haven't been golfing so well and I just don't feel like talking about it. now i feel obligated to talk some, so I will. I have been on and off with my driver, and on friday I hit seven fairways, but two or three that I missed were good drives, just not in the fairway. I went 46-43 on friday for bogey golf 89 and missed every green on the course. Six par saves, 4 out of 4 for sandie chances salvaged a bad start and end of four doubles and a triple. I continue to struggle on the last three holes at winnetka, so I think I just need to make a plan for those holes to get bogies on them and get out alive. So I will. 16th Hole: I am a headcase with the driver on this hole, I just can't put the ball in the fairway. That isn't a good thought, of course, so I need to just think about the nice (thin) green patch out there in the middle. If I put my ball to the right as usual, I just need to pitch out to a short iron distance, put it on, and make bogey. If I have a good drive (It hasn't happened enough to know what a good plan would be but...) I should just take a bit of extra club or lay up or something, because if I miss the green on either side, that's not good. Right of sixteen greenI have rarely gotten up and down from and left is in the water. It's a very big green, so (Insert conclusion here). 17th Hole: Three wood. Never driver. Maybe rescue mid if the conditions are good, but no driver. Just put it in front of the green if the three wood won't reach. Up and down for par is a good score for me here. Just a nice easy swing, even if I would need a hard one to reach the green. The green is very receptive to both sand shots and pitches, so no worries there. On the green just don't play too much break. 18th Hole: If the tees are up elevated, this may well not be a reachable par four with out a booming drive. play it safe then for the bogey. don't take the three wood off the fairway unless I gain more confidence with it off the deck (or at all). From down below I might have an iron into the green, so play for some roll (not too much) and do the best i can. The green is easier to chip onto when the pin is on the opposite side. A weird stance in the fairway might freak me out, so again, don't have to take the three wood. I have had a three iron roll over the green after landing in front of it, so maybe think about that play from 200 yards out. Its the last hole so I really need to keep my focus mentally. Okay I have to go to bed now, so good night all.
