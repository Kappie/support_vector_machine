Anyone can do it."......yea, sure anyone can do it.....dat's y u no longer have a tv show in our singapore tv schedule.......and it just occurred to me that chefs on tv really have it going for them......i mean think abt it.....they can teach pple how to make great dishes on tv and not worry abt getting bad feedback.....y? they could just simply say, "u didnt do it rite." it's all too subjective.........so u see, martin yan is actually one smart dumbass......  was reading a blog maintained by a certain Germany obsessed chick......and after reading her blog for the past wk, ill say one thing......"It's ok Chok Tong. You can't convince everyone."  not trying to put her dreams and aspirations in a bad light or anything....but i really wonder how many pple out there are the same as this SPG-to-be........and the more i read her blog, i realise how stuck onto her dreams she is, whether Germany's in the picture or not......which is good cos she has conviction.....and yet in a certain way too idealistic for comfort......then again, i remember being idealistic too.....  there is a certain thing that really concerns me......leavers are gonna be one pretty sad bunch......i'll bet that amongst all the reasoning that the world is their playground and that their hearts are still in singapore or whatever bull they can come up wif to try and justify their leaving their homeland, they still know deep down inside they have in a way, betrayed their home.......and become pple wif a lost identity....  back to the topic of the sourcrout obsessed blogger, ill just say one more thing......her future boyfriends might have some inadequacy issues to contend wif.......yep, for those who have followed my blog, u should have known this was coming.....
