This revelation came to be as my Great-Grandmother was cursing and damning me in her native tongue. The only sentence I was able to make out was "Ruah ainikle, nebach shanda fermished yetzet harah. Oy, vey is mir," roughly translated means "Wicked grandchild, it's such a pitty and disgrace that you messed up on an evil impulse. Oh, woe is me."   Other then that sentence I was able to figure out bits and pieces of what she was saying. She referred to sex as "chazerai" (disgusting stuff), kept waning on about marriage (kedushin) and how I have sinned (aveyra). She  referred to both Leslie and I as curva (whore) and the baby as a mamzer (bastard child).   Note to self: brush up on the language before next visit to Great-Grandma.
