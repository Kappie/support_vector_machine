Shattered Galaxy ( urlLink www.sgalaxy.com ) It's a Mass Multiplayer Online Real Time Strategy game, completely fun and pretty addictive. My cousin Sebastian and I can't get enough of this game. Maybe someday someone will read this game and join us.  Oh and may I also inform you that this game is Free to download and play off of  urlLink www.sgalaxy.com
