The race for nuclear weapons is on a fast track. Ten years back no one could have imagined that there can be any possibility of someone detonating a nuke in an urban area which has a high density of population. But today it is an event governments all over the world are preparing for. Recently a web of nuclear proliferation was uncovered when the Father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb was caught red handed trying to sell highly sensitive information pertaining to nuclear weapons to Osama Bin Laden and his friends.

The civilized world must stand together in this fight for humanity.
