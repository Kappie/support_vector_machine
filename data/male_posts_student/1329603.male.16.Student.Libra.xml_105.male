There are only 3 people online on MSN, and one of them is French, and so I'm intensely bored, right at the moment.To be honest, online I only really have CONVERSATIONS with Laura and Jodie. Sometimes with Scott, but it's not usually very detailed. So, I'm bored, and blogging. Blogging and bored. Coming to think of it, it's not a very good combination because I'm just going to bore all of you by blogging when I'm bored, but still, worth a try.  One of the passport photos me and Laura got done (I ripped them so that we both got 2, quite masterfully, even if I say so myself) is in Laura's wallet ^_^ one's on her wall ^_^ one's on my wall ^_^ and one's going to go in my wallet after I've had enough of it being on my desk ^_^. Jon's pleased. Although I've got nothing really to count down to, now. Mocks are gone, it's AAAGES until any concerts or performances I've got... I suppose I could count down the 1.5 hours or so until the Les Mis rehearsal. That'd do. *counts seconds on watch* Hm, I need to meet her again soonish.  I'm really getting into the Dubliners. I bought the CD ages ago, but now it's one of the few CDs that I don't skip through. Obviously, I ripped it onto my PC, and so some of the tracks come up when I do the "All Music" thing, which I tend to. But still... Dubliners are cool and Irish.  Oh, could also count down to Zoe's birthday party! Which I've been invited to, for the first time EVER. It's still 13 days away, but still, I really want to have things to count down to, to make up for the low I'm on after yesterday's supreme high.  I'm trying to redesign my blog, as I have been inspired by Lisa.  Quote of the day: "I've been a Wild Rover for many's the year, And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer. But now I'm returning with gold in great store, And I never will play the Wild Rover, no more."  From the Irish Folk song   The Wild Rover   Love, Jon Roskilly
