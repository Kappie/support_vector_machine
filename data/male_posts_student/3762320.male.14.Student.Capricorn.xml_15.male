Did anyone else see the Home Run Derby, it was sweet, one of the batters broke the record for most in a round and most in a derby, and Berkman from the Astros made it to the finals. Right now i'm watchin the celebrities vs. legends game, watch the All-Star game tomorrow, or watch the World Series of Poker, or watch Big Brother and The Amazing Race, i have some VCRs hooked up so i can tape some things. Also watch ESPN25, u gotta watch something tomorrow night.
