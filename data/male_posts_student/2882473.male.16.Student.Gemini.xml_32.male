I'd better not say what they were in case she reads this. Anyway, that took up all the morning. Since then I've been dividing my time into revising, playing on the computer, eating and sleeping. I started to get a bit worried this morning though, as I flicked through the geography revision guide. I was amazed at how little of it I think I know. With the science ones,especially chemistry and physics, I probably know a lot of it already, and it only took about 3 days to read through and feel confident with the chemistry one - even with spending most of the time playing on computer and watching tv. But geography... I don't seem to know any of it. Probably less than a quarter I know already. So this means that I will actually have to properly revise it, read it, makes notes, re-read, remember etc. Wow, and there's over 100 pages to it. Wow. I'm buggered. So, after about 20 pages of it I gave up, being immensely bored.   This morning I did a bit more geograohy revision, that was before I gave up earlier today. When that got boring, I did a bit of biology. That also soon got boring. So, it was computer time, followed by a lunch, an extened episode of 'Diagnosis Murder' and 'Back to the Future Part 1' - even though I must have seen that film at least 5 times before. And now here I sit, nothing on tv, and revision looking difficult. Oh well. During the mock exams in December I managed to get a grade B on geography, and that was without revising, so with a bit of revision hopefully I will get an A. Even if I don't, a B is still good. At least I already have my A* in Maths. Woooo! Oh Yeh!!!!! Take that, Nonnesuch and Megatrobe! Sorry, I promised I wouldn't gloat any more. I haven't really got anything to say, so that will be all for today.
