Every one wants to line up to get some free money from corporate America. All of these should be thrown out. There is not a good reason why anyone living today should be held responsible for a horrible period in history. African scholars and politicians today must be honest and admit that the enslavement and sale of Africans from the seventeenth century onwards was done by the Africans themselves, especially the coastal kings and their elders, and that very few Europeans actually ever marched inland and captured slaves themselves. Where do the people of European extraction go to get their reparations? Europeans were enslaved on a regular basis in the 10th and 11th centuries. I would imagine that you will find white slaves in Africa at some point in time. Should we then be able to sue Black Americans for their ancestors involvement in that? Let us stop this shit now!!  Some quotes from break: "Dan you can stop staring now" --me "She's a severe hottie" --Dan out of character and in a daze "I just want some ribs" --me "You guys are always talking about serious ideas, and then one of you will say something like 'then the pope was like, "what's the dealy yo, yo"'" --Me "You don't need to sit back there, sit up at one of these nice tables" --a security guard at the public library to me "You fell in love with that boi, you freak" –Dan to me concerning the 76 "Cope" –Sam to me while throwing a pack of cigarettes "That's the best fire pit I ever dug in fifteen minutes in the dark" --me "We're at Lowe's buying charcoal, lighter fluid, and an axe, this is awesome" --me "Hahahahahahahahaha" the four of us (family) during The Butterfly Effect, while everyone else in the theater was not laughing "Dude, they had double deuces of old English for 59 cents" --um, me I guess "Cigs 9.99 per carton" --a billboard "Your back porch smells like pall malls and malt liquor this morning" --Maybe me again, yes me "I just worked my ass off fo dem folks, and they only give me a dollar" --IHOP waitress to me (she was a psycho) "Got tin milagrams o' moephine n some good hash from flowda" --a drug dealer  It is so terribly nice out today that I am almost giddy. It made me wonder about the extent that the external influences my emotions. I have always put so much stake by my emotions (whether I wanted to or not) that I began to worry about there value, if they were just the results of things like weather. I worried for about it for ten seconds, or so, (probably because it was so nice out that I couldn’t worry about anything….not even that Greek test tomorrow) and I realized that it doesn’t matter if my emotions are influenced by or even the effects of my surroundings and my experiences….if they weren’t I would probably be institutionalized.
