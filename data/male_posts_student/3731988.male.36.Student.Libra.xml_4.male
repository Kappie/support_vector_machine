Voting formalities aside -- not because they'll steal it, like the present commander-in-thief, but because Americans love their country -- John Kerry and John Edwards will soon set America back on track, and bring our world back from the brink of disaster. Our country, the planet, the universe, has just breathed a collective sigh of relief. It's time to let America be America again...and Bush can settle for being Texan.  In the ongoing illustration on how far back on their heels the incompetent president's campaign is, they continue to sling mud and pray that something sticks. Following the political direction of right-wing scumbag Dick Morris -- whose expert advice amounts to "insult them to drive up their negatives" -- desperate Republicans have been doing just that. In an attempt to say something positive, though, the Bush campaign is releasing an ad featuring John McCain that reminds Americans not to forget we are at war. But do so optimistically. And, bringing together some old family friends for the first time in a long time, Osama bin Laden's image appears in the ad. Now, one might wonder why the Bushies would want to put the image of the man George let get away in their campaign ads...but then, one might wonder why the Bushies do alot of things.   But those days are behind us now...or soon will be. It is time for America to be America again. And starting in January, it will be.
