It was a beautiful sunny morning in Tulsa and the Johnson's were getting ready for their yearly trip to Silver Dollar City, an Amusement Park located in Missouri. It's a family tradition for the Johnson's to visit Silver Dollar City every year. Everything was packed and ready to go by 6:00 AM. There was an attitude of excitement running through the house as everyone got ready for what was usually a four to five hour trip. Dad and mom went through the checklist one more time to make sure everything was packed and ready to go. Little did they know, but they missed a whole bag. 	By now it was getting to be 6:30, so everyone jumped in the van, excited to get on the road. They decided to eat their breakfast enroute, which consisted of bagels and strawberry cream cheese. Mom spread the cream cheese on everyone's bagel and passed them through the van. The last bagel almost made it to Johnny, but not quite. He dropped it on the seat and it got all over the place. Then Jenny's orange juice spilt all over her because she was paying too much attention to Johnny while he was dropping his bagel. Luckily mom brought napkins along. 	An hour passed. Everything seemed to be going as planned, dad realized he took a wrong turn. The road signs just didn't look familiar. He had gotten off course only by fifteen minutes, but fifteen minutes was plenty. He turned the van around and got back on the right road.  	The kids slept for an hour, so mom and dad got a chance to talk. In that hour they realized they had forgotten mom's bag of hygiene items at home. Since they were already two hours from home they decided that it would be alright without the hair products, toothbrush, and toothpaste. All of a sudden the van came to a stop and the kids woke up. It was construction! Dad was not happy about this. The roadwork made them take a detour which added an extra half hour from their travel time. Things were just not going well on this car trip from heck. 	It was definitely time for a gas stop. They pulled into a gas station that looked like a good gas station. Dad filled up the tank and everyone else went in to get something to drink and use the bathrooms, which Jimmy found to be rather disgusting. And the clerk was scary-looking. To dad's surprise, gas was $2.15 per gallon. He was not real excited since it cost him about $45.  	They got back on the road, and the rest of the ride went well. No spills, high gas prices, dirty bathrooms, scary clerks, or construction, the weather was beautiful. The hotel finally came into sight, everyone was excited to be finished with the long car trip. This was a hotel that they had never stayed at before, the first impression was not a very good one, which started the trip from heck....
