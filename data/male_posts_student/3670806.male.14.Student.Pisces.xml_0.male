They're mainly a religious party, who governs us based on their religious philosiphies. Even besides religion, they no longer believe in gun rights, and they made the "Patriot" Act. They claim they're for "small government" but it's quite the opposite. But back to religion, it's annoying to have some radical Christian government tell the country that "sex is bad" and so forth- John Ashcroft is like, the epitome of the religious, authoritarian Conservative. Ashcroft has spearheaded a huge anti-porn campaign, and has supported way tighter FCC regulations. Both things that majorly piss me off. This whole Christian Crusade against abortion, sex, porn, drugs, YOU NAME IT... DOES NOT belong in our national policy. I've had enough of these annoying fundamentalists imposing their will on me. Hey, you church organizations and lobby groups- preach to your own people whatever whe hell you want- But keep it outta my government.
