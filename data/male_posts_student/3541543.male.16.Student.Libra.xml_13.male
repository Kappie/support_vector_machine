There is only one thing that pisses me off and it's the lettuce on the damn sandwich's. Shred the damn lettuce. I order a chicken sandwhich and I get a whole freaking leaf of lettuce. I don't wanna eat that hard thing in the middle of the lettuce. Wtf Wendy's shred or cut some lettuce up, it isn't that hard. Oh well I'm just a complainer but still the lettuce thing just gets to me. Anyways about my earlier post, I'm not going to finish up whatever I said I was. Also driving to Wendy's I happen to see a fat redneck chick that horrifyingly resembles Jabba the Hutt. Ah to live in southwest haha, it was gross. Just a big mass of flesh moving back and forth on a porch swing, eyeing everyone that passes by.....creepy. Alright well I'm going to be going now. see you all later.
