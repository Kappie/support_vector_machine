I thought you were a friend I couldn't really see You don't have to pretend   I thought you were better You seemed to be nice I hate this feeling, Feeling cold as ice   You hid yourself Behind my back Saying words And not looking back   I've went too long Feelings went right through But now I can see You aren't really you   How could you do this? It hurts so much more Thinking of yourself And no one more   You let somebody Rip your heart out Then maybe we'll have something Something we can talk about.   -- Sean Hyde, 16 Saint Pius X High School Pottstown, Penn.
