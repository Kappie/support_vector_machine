I've seen Live Journals before. Diary? Diary??? Oh dear god...  I'm sort of active on the internet, you can see me mostly on the  urlLink PPT forums  and  urlLink SPI forums . I have an alter ego which I will talk about sometime later...  BookCrossing? Yep, that's what I'm going to talk about for now. Ever heard about it before? If you haven't, I suggest hopping over to  urlLink BookCrossing.com  and check out the site.   urlLink This  is the article that appeared in the daily newspaper The Star on August 20, 2002.  From the main page:    The "3 Rs" of BookCrossing...       Read    a good book (you already know how to do that)     Register    it  urlLink here  (along with your journal comments), get a unique BCID ( B ook C rossing  ID  number), and  urlLink label the book       Release    it for someone else to read (give it to a friend, leave it on a park bench, donate it to charity, "forget" it in a coffee shop, etc.), and get notified by email each time someone comes here and records journal entries for that book. And if you make  urlLink Release Notes  on the book, others can  urlLink Go Hunting  for it and try to find it!
