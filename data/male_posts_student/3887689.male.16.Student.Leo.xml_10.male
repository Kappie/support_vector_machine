There are a multitude of reasons for why I hate Bush, but I'm just gonna stick with one for this entry, and that's gay marriage. Now, it doesn't bother me so much that Mr. Bush is opposed to gay marriage. Everyone has their opinion on how things should be and I respect his. However, I think he is despicable for trying to make an amendment to ban it. Am I the only person in the world who finds this utterly ridiculous? A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT?! Does this seem kind of un-American to anyone? This is America, the land of the free! Unless you're black, gay, or Indian of course, but that goes without saying. I don't know what kind of ridiculous shit the conservatives are trying to justify this with. Religious values would be my first guess. But then, we have just a teensy problem with that, a little law passed a while back that had something in it about "seperation of church and state". Perhaps you've heard of it. Or maybe, as my stepmother frequently tries to tell me, the argument is "to protect the sanctity of marriage". RIGHT. To protect the sanctity of marriage. Seems like a valid reason. But if we're trying to protect the sanctity of marriage, why stop at gayness? I say we should have a constitutional amendment banning adultery. And anyone who breaks this will receive no less than the death penalty. Because god damn it, this is America, the home of the free! And why even stop there? I say we ban divorce. Hope you like your wife, because she's all you're getting for the rest of your life! Let freedom RING! WOOHOO! Well, that's enough of that. Hope you enjoyed this one. I know you've heard a million times about how much of an asshole Bush is, but here in America we can all throw our two cents in, and that's what I opted to do. Good day to you.
