Mistake (those of you who know me well know I can't handle caffeine in any amount) the above two factors led to my staying up til around 5:30. Some of you may not think that's so bad, but past 11pm you've got to be dead silent in my house...  So I'm looking out my window at the indigo sky at 5:30, then, without even blinking, my eyes open to see an orange sky at 9:45... I was most likely abducted by aliens. That's the only theory I've got to account for this missing time.... Ok, so I had a rough night... I'll probably get to relax today, right? fat chance...  Retardo Montalban calls me at 9:45 to come over and help Will put gutter guards on the gutters... It must have been 500ÂºF on the roof... I'd developed a sore throat, and from overeating nonstop the last three days, I'd gotten a funky stomach... so baking on the roof didn't help.... I'm supposed to be reading or writing something near-valuable now, but I feel like carrion.
