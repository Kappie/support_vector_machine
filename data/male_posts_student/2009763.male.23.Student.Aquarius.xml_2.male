We usually have abut 40 to 50 people including sponsors this year we had about 80 which was really cool. Some of the people were from a Filipino Church that use our west end of the First Baptist Church as a place to have services so our youth minister invited there youth group to come they had about 6 people that came. About half the people I knew and about the other half I didn't so we all got to make new friends. Falls Creek theme this year was Go its about Matthew 28:19-20 Therefore Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. There is more of verse 20 but this is what we talked about. This year they taught us about getting people saved and simple ways of showing us how to do it. Usually the people at Falls Creek are always about getting as many people saved before the week is done. But this year they still got people saved but they also taught us how to get people saved.  This is also the Last year the Tabernacle will be up before the tear it down to make a bigger one which will hold about 9,000 people. It will be indoors with AC and there adding a lot of other stuff.  Ok in our cabin we had about 15 people get and about 12 of them were girls who got saved in the girls bathroom at 12:00 in the the night! I think it was awsome but also kinda funny. This year is also Bill Greens last year at Falls Creek. He has been there for about 15 years! That's a long time. Well when the week was We had to vehicles to ride us down our bus and van because we didn't enough people to fit all of them in the bus so I rode in the van. The youth group calls the van old blue because its an old blue van. Well we were driven home and we started to here this noise and it sounded like the van was about to die so got off the exit ramp which want very far from and we saw the church near by so we got to the church right before o' blue died. The church was empty there was notihg in it it hasn't been opened yet. So we saw some people at the church it was a lady and her mom. They stopped so they cold give there baby a rest while they did the dishes. They were from New Mexico and the were heading up to Illinois. And they happened to have some spare parts our fuel cleaner or somethin I forgot what it was  called had clogged up. So we asked them if they had one and just happened to pull out one that was the exact type that we needed so we thanked and told we hope they got to Illinois ok and then they left and we called one of the kids dad who had the tool we needed to put the thing on so we waited about an hour for them and they got there and it worked so we left and right about when we were in Enid heading back to the Church it started to break down again so ran about 4 stop signs  and a red light to get to the church cause if we stopped the van would of died so we finally got to the church and I got home and watched a movie and fell asleep   I 'll post another part of the last coulple of weeks soon so see ya then J.J..
