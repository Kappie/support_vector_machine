Will the depreciation go or will the aspiration? time will tell. If only it'd open it's fatass gap earlier.  PJC is a bore. The orientation thing was ill planned and they had us in the hall practically the whole day. Then, they made us play very very stupid and POINTLESS games. I mean it. I shan't elaborate. I made the best out of it. Didn't wanna say anything to offend the nice leader boy...  Help... God... Help
