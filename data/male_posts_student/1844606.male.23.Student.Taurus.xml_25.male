TV Narrator voice:  Previously in my Dreams   Setting:  I think I'm in college, but I'm actually wondering around LHS combined with Highland.  Outside the Auditorium entrence at LHS.  Hundreds of Blonde women with Microphones screaming to go inside.  I walk inside and find a bathroom. (how sad is it that even in my dreams, I act like real life).  As I sit down, the walls blow away and all the women are standing there laughing.  I continue to sit, because I apparently understand that this is a test of wills.  I look to the left and see some kid from my Rhet class (the one who DOESN'T LIKE THE BIG LEBOWSKI!!!!!!) and he stands up, drops trow and beings to manually stimulate himself.  In two swift strokes, he manages to pelt the women with his juices.  But it gets more bizzare  Magically I am transplanted to the gym at Highland and I see a kid from my floor Freshman year start to wrestle w/ some guy.  In order to prove his point, he also sheds his pants and in two quick motions covers the guy in his man juice.    Last night, I had a dream that a former flame urinated on her ex-boyfriend's face.  He then promptly got up and threw a Bowie knife at me.   Seriously, what the hell is going on in my head.
