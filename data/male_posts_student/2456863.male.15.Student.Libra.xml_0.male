Essay test in English on To kill a Mockingbird, which we got not nearly enough time for, easy geometry test, and got recruited for math league, almost felt like Katie was "asking" me to do something. She's our pastor's wife, who when she asks you to do something, she is really telling you to do it.  Something Bonnie likes to do too.  Gym was fun again today, my hand didn't hurt much, but I've decided that I just can't do handstands (and most things that you need to do them for) but its fun anyway.  mhmm so yeah.. Band is getting really boring.  I like Mr. carroll better for church music things.  He's not so crabby then.
