With all of the decisions coming up in my life I've come to realize that there's almost always too many variables to consider all of them, so all of our decisions really are just a simplification of our problem.  And I've been realizing more and more lately that all of my problems can be solved with the simple answer "Do The Right Thing."  A lot of people talk about how hard it is to determine what the right thing is, or how the right thing might not always be the same for every person.  And both of these are true.  But they are the exception to the rule; the vast majority of the deicisons in our life (especially the small ones that make up most of what we do) have a relatively blatant "right" action or reaction we ought to do.  Of course, the trouble is actually doing it; a lot of the time the right thing is a lot harder than the wrong thing or the right thing's next-best alternative, whether it be physical or emotional exertion or social rejection or whatever.  But I've also been realizing that the more you make the right choices in the little things, the easier it is to make the right decisions in the big things (and the more evident the right thing to do seems to be).  Like Dave said last night, God only wants us to be holy for the next 60 seconds...then the next 60 seconds...and so on and so forth.  And breaking things down like this has really been helping me; too often I try to have a universalist perspective on things and try to consider what will be the best for the most people, but I've been deciding recently that a lot of the time this perspective is simply wrong (quite simply, because what seems best for the greatest number of people isn't usually what actually is best for them).  And it's also just so much SIMPLER to distill right and wrong actions down into a set of maxims instead of always trying to figure out the right reaction based upon the circumstances.
