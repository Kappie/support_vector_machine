So he came back today after the final performance of vbs (yay, yay...) and taking my great grandmother some food...that's better than the goo they try to give her. But, now for the meaning of the title...Since i am going into highschool and all that fun stuff, i'll be going a few places by myself and doing things for long periods of time away from parental supervision. So, naturally, i need a way to check in with my folks. (who says folks?) And so, my dad got me a cell phone. Yahoo! I can call anyone in my family for free! So if you want to talk to me, you can call me so you will pay for the time, and i won't! But i can't talk long because i have a limited amount of minutes. And if you want to talk more than a bit (for what reason i don't know) call after 9 pm cause then i get unlimited minutes...but that doesn't really matter because no one knows my phone number! and that's the way it's going to stay. Not because i don't want to talk to you, well maybe i don't. But maybe i do. So now I'll just leave you in suspence forever. My brother and mom and dad all got new cells, and there's can take pics, but mine is great for me. And I'm happy, I wasn't going to get one, but then he got this one. So there you go. Out for now, I'm wiped. No...as in exhausted.
