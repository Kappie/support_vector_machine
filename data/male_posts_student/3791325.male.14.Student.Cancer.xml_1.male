I'm sorry to say, but i suffer from short term memory loss(not really though, even though it really seems like at time). ANYWAYS, Let me tell you a little about myself. I like long walks on the beach at night... Jk lol Truthfully, MY LIFE STINKS! Well, it used to stink more... But I got through that crap with help from friends, family, and people at the hospital that I forget their names(SEE! what did I tell you, SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS!!). Now lets review my paaaaaasssst(screen turns fadey, then it shows me as a little kid...) There is me, a some what short little tyke with a some what darkish colored hair, and BIG OL' blue eyes that just stare in wonder at everything. I am sitting there like a polite calm little boy... HELL NO! I have ADHD so of coarse I wasn't calm! so now image the kid i described, not just sitting there, but boucing his foot... Then his other foot kicks in... Then he starts to bounce up n' down in his seat... Then before you know it, I'm covered in honey and syrup, bagel crumbs, and running off the walls in my underwear! LOL Now, enough about how I acted, now on to how everybody around me acted!... YEA in just a sec, my cat is wanting deh attention from me... ................................................................................ Ok back! Now where was I?... Oh yes, my CRAPPY childhood! Lets start off with my dad... Uhg... My DAD! What a stupid fucker! He is suck a little bitch! All I know now of him, is that I have a restraining order on him. He was abusive both verbally and physically! But I fought back, no worries, it wasn't me who got it bad back then, it was my mom. I felt soooo sorry for her. It made me ten times more mad at him! Thats where my violence problem started. I watched and learned from him, to get anything from him, I would have to use violence. And because dads are an important need in EVERY little boys life, I needed lots of things from him, so I had to use violence... It doesn't really help me now though. It almost got me in big touble in fact! I can remember getting into over 50 fights in elementary school. Just because I didn't like what they said, or how they oproached me! What a little bastard I was... Then I went into the fourth grade, that was the worst low I had so far in my life. STRAIGHT F's ALL THROUGH THE YEAR! I was surprised I didn't get held back! But that year was also a good one, because that was the same year I was reunited with an old friend. One of my friends from when I lived in an apartmemt complex. That year is the year I made my best friend, Jonny. An outgoing kind of kid, he now suffers the same kind of problems I do, and have. But we were UNSEPERABLE!!! Anyways, the next year in fifth grade, we luckily got the same class together, but that was also the year where selfesteem charts rode high for most kids. Always picking on me and him just because they thought it made them cool! Little ASSHOLES THEY WERE! Grrrrr... Now when we got into middle school, it all went backwards. Evertthing went wrong that could go wrong. Now being picked on ten times worse for being different. Now poeple, you have to understand that I would never ever be able to fit in! I was as different as they get! So changing was not an option. Besides, why should I change who I am for others convience?! NO! I wasn't gunna change who I was. But that attitude got me sucked into worse things. I now had to take meds for my ADHD and that was really screwing with me. And it messed with my mood to. It put me in an eternal hate. I wanted to KILL everyone, very distincly to. So near the end of eighth grade, I was super depressed and threated to commit suicide, so my mom put me in a phsych ward, where I stayed for six days learning how to cope with my hate for myself and others. I am out and good now though. I am now going into high school, and I hope it is WAY different from middle school. I am still best friends with Jonny. And in fact I have much more friends than I ever have had. I also have a girl friend who I have been going good since June 20, 2004. She is all I could ever want in a girl. She is funny, so very pretty, great sense of style, very secksey! And best of all, she has that special loving personality that just singles you out and makes you feel like you can do anything. I would have to say that I am addicted to her. There is never a moment when she slips my mind.
