He said the purpose of the church was to glorify God and not to make sinners feel comfortable at church.  In other words, church isn't a tool for evangelism.  We shouldn't try to make sinners come to church to get saved in big groups.  Church is a place where we gather and the Holy Spirit is present.  Sinners will never feel comfortable in His presence and we shouldn't try to make them feel so.  Sunday evening was the end of Second Kings.  How Judah was destroyed but God still kept alive a seed of David.  It was also neat to see how God fulfilled His promises.  First that Judah would be taken captive.  Second that Zedekiah (a.k.a Jeconiah and Jehoiachin) would not see Babylon.  Third that Zedekiah would see the king of Babylon and that he would go to Babylon.  It seems like they contradict.  What happened is that Zedekiah saw the king, the king gouged out his eyes, sent him to Babylon, and then imprisoned him there.  Gruesome, yet amazing.  There are so many more promises that were made for Israel if they rebelled.  Those were made in Deuteronomy.  They were also fulfilled.  God is incredible.  I pray that I remember God's promises to me that I may not sin.  Lord, help us all to fear you.
