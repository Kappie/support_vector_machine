We jus hit around for a while so i could warm up for the 1st fragment of the hitting part. Well first off we started of with a prayer...yes we needed as much help as possible...so we started to shoot the video. I had to hit a few outside hits, then i had to hit a few middle sets, mostly 2's. Dan wanted to redue it, so we started over again. The 2nd time through, i did much better on the outside, so we moved on to the middle hits again. I hit a few 2's, then i moved on to hitting 1's and 3's...and that was it for the day. I looked at the video, i thought i did pretty well, a few of my hits were really good, but i needed a bit more work on it...i guess we will do that on friday. So i did a pretty good job today.    Right now, im pretty sore from all of the practicing...my thighs r worked and my back is really sore...i guess i need to take the day off tomorrow to chill...but after that day, im right back to vball, cuz i want to achieve a dream...this weekend im goin to b attending a vball camp at Pacific University, its up at stockton. Hopefully i will learn a few things so i could get my hitting really down and my all around game...I saw her today, outside of the gym...i kinda felt a lil sad and stuff cuz yeah...w/e, i jus have to live with that for now...that was my day...payce.
