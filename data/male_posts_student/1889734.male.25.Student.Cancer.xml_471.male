I think Canada should be worried about Quebec more, if that ever falls through, the country is finished, even with a Carribean province.  I kind of like the idea of Quebec leaving, if only because of the interest of Saskatchewan and Manitoba being US property.  Fun stuff, put a maple leaf as the 51st star.
