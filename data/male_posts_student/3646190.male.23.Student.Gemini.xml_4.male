Regardless of your political persuasion, this is one for the ages that I feel may have a greater impact on the November election than people may initially think. This administration has done a masterful job of obfuscating the national debate on Iraq and terrorism by misinformation, and lies, and best-case scenario promises and for the 2 hours I watched this movie I felt that finally, there was some clarity to these issues.   The connections that he makes between the Bush and Saudi family, although not new, are so necessary for the American people to see and understand. What I found especially interesting though was the connection Moore establishes between Hamid Karzai - the President of Afghanistan - and his links to the Kal group, a major US defense contractor. A major criticism I've heard of the film thus far is that Moore himself does not really draw any firm conclusions with respect to the Saudi-Bush-defense contractor links that he draws, but I don't know how much more painfully obvious he can be. Although said to be fought for altruistic reasons to liberate Iraqis and protect Americans, it's extremely clear that 911 was the golden opportunity for the people in power and their friends to make a whole lot of money. And when there is money to be made, those interests typically supercede those of the American and Iraqi people. It's the reason why Haliburton is getting no-bid contracts which is screwing American tax payers out of hundreds of millions of dollars. It's the reason why official body counts of Iraqi casualties have purposefully not been kept by the occupying forces, so we can forget about the actual human toll for American greed. The right has glossed over these types of issues and discredits them on-face as conspiracy theories or as un-American. And that's why i appreciate this movie so much, because it forces us to finally consider the facts seriously.   There was one scene in particular that just sent chills down my spine and made me want to crawl under my seat and hide. It was the one of the Iraqi mother crying because she had lost her family. It was as pure a display of emotion as I have ever scene in a movie and I just couldn't take it. She kept asking why she had to lose her family, cursing in Arabic the United States for what they had done to her family and country. And sitting in my seat i felt so culpable for what had happened to her as if it were me that was personally responsible for the loss of her family, because I am an American. Perhaps if this war had truly been fought for altruistic reasons I wouldn't have felt as bad for her, but really her family died for the benefit of Bush and his cronies and it absolutely frustrates and infuriates me. I guess that's why I hope to one day be involved in the foreign policy decision making apparatus of this country, so that people in America and other countries won't have to suffer for the greed and benefit of the elite of this country.   Or perhaps Iâ€™m just delusional in thinking that could ever really happen...
