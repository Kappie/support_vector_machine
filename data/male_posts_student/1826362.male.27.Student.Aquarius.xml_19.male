But what did J. K. ever do to you Bloomy?  And he's right, "Harry Potter will not lead our children on to Kipling's Just So Stories or his Jungle Book. It will not lead them to Thurber's Thirteen Clocks or Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows or Lewis Carroll's Alice." HP will only lead to more HP and HP related products, but what will lead them on to the classics is confidence in their reading ability and the gentle (or not so gentle) urgings of their  urlLink friendly neighborhood children's bookseller .
