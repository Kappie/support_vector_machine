OK, I'll bite, just type it in... Oh dear God, what is that!!!!, you exclaim, closing the browser in horror. Although you can purge your IE cache to expunge any physical traces of your visit after the shaking stops, youwill neverget Norton Systemworks to install inside your tortured mind.  If this scenario sounds familiar, then chances are you were, at one point in your life, tubgirled. Although some people are ultimately able to laugh at their trauma, others never quite seem to be the same after viewing that enigma wrapped up in a mystery wrapped up in a brown geyser. I have noticed two general reactions to the tubgirl phenomenon, which I will dub "A" and "B".   TYPE A: A type "A" tubgirl victimwas initially horrified and confused by what they saw, and, in fact, may not be entirely certain what they just looked at. However, any morbid curiosity on their behalf will be quickly swallowed up by one single, all-consuming mania: "Who can I show this too?" My theory is that a type "A" tubgirl victim can only survive what thy have just seen by passing its unholye-miasma along to another victim. A good analogy to help you understand this would be the movie  The Ring .   TYPE B:Statistical analysis of a sample oftype "B" tubgirl victims reveals that most of them are exposed to the phenomenon through a type "A" acquiantance. The type "B" victim's symptoms display themselves similarly for the first few minutes, and they may be confused with type "A" symptoms by the casual observer. However, the type B victim never feels the need to pass the burden of seeing along. Instead, they feel a need to understand who, howand why tubgirl is pressing down on them like a crushing weight. Long-term morbidity data is forthcoming.   My research into this matter has caused me to speculate about the existence of type "C" victims, for want of a better term, who do not seem to be affected by the TG miasma. My best working hypothesis is that these "victims" are not fully human and therefore immune to the condition; however, I can not state this with confidence until I have performed several comparative autopsies. In this matter, I can only hope that Seamus's girlfriend Stacy will come through for me.   In conclusion, to all you type A's out there, rest easy--the danger has already passed. Type B's, you are in my prayers, and we are hard at work on a cure for your condition. Type C's, if you really exist, please come forward. And finally, for those out there who have seen no trauma gushing forth as a fountainas of yet-- if, one day, you see the tub loading on a computer screen, avert your eyes and save your soul!!
