It's like rediscovering the band...it is fun.  The weekend is coming and I can't wait...cause I want to sleep in...we had a half day today so I took a nap when I got home...  I am also excited cause the  Suicide Machines  are coming DECEMBER 20th...and I definitly plan on going...  "Mendoza!" -Mustard Plug
