Joe and Scott skipped down main street Wolfville together, showering one another with praise, causing Joe’s head to become, er, large. Speaking of swelling, holy cow Joe...  urlLink    Scott and Big Joe urlLink    The Rt. Honourable Joe is continuing his pick-and-choose campaign leading up to the election. For Clark, Paul is purgatory and Harper is hell, so better to go with the former. But in the meantime, Joe will throw his support behind those candidates he deems worthy, whether they be Liberal or Conservative. Brison is one of the blessed few lucky enough to receive Joe’s endorsement. Lucky lucky!  Clark, however, is a bit more circumspect about his choices in his own riding of Calgary South-Centre. The Globe and Mail reported that:   Mr. Clark, who said he would cast a secret ballot in Calgary South Centre on voting day, stated he would support a handful of candidates who were not Conservatives and encouraged all Canadians to vote for individuals rather than along party lines.   A secret ballot? But wait a moment, wasn't the Conservative candidate in that riding, Jim Prentice, one of the annointed few that Clark would vote for? Sure was (from the CBC):   Clark said that in the next election, Canadians should not vote for parties but for the best candidate in their constituency. Clark said he's prepared to support candidates from all parties, including an old political rival, former NDP leader Ed Broadbent, who is running in Ottawa.  And he said he would be working for [Jim] Prentice in his old riding.   So what has changed between then and now?  This has  (from the G  M):   A spokesman for former party leadership contestant Jim Prentice rejected Mr. Clark's offer to campaign for Mr. Prentice in his Calgary riding.  Mr. Clark hadn't yet made such an offer in person and "if and when he does, he will be told that it would be inappropriate because Jim does not share his assessment of the leader and the party," Jason Hatcher said yesterday.    and (from the Toronto Star):   Joe Clark's advice to bewildered voters took on a faintly comical air last week, when the candidate to whom he offered his support promptly rejected it.....It turned out that he [Clark] hadn't shared this news with Prentice, one of the party's star candidates. When the 47-year-old lawyer heard that Clark was planning to back him, he swiftly quashed the idea. "It's difficult to accept his support since we don't agree about Stephen Harper and we don't agree on the new Conservative party," Prentice pointed out.   Too bad the people reporting on Joe's triumphant appearance in the waiting arms of Scott Brison didn't mention that Brison is fairly exceptional in actually  wanting  Joe's help.
