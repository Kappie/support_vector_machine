Keep your phone on vibrate and when it rings and it's your mom or dad or relative, answer it. Screw what the teacher says. And if they try to take it from you. Throw a pen at their eye...here it is.  "Last Friday in English class, this kid's cell phone rang. My school's strict about cell phones so my English teacher went over to him right away. My English teacher told the kid to take it out, so he did, but he answered it too. All he said was "Hello?" because my English teacher grabbed it out of his hand. So whoever was calling kept doing it for a while until my teacher turned the phone off. So on Monday when everyone went back to school, we found out the kid's dad died and it was him who called him during class asking his son where his heart pills were."  Ok, so besides for the gay chunkling of 2 weeks left of school, this weekend was fun. Saturday was a band practice with Paul, James and Heaton. We got down All Downhill From Here (New Found Glory) perfectly. Sounds really good. We also tried to do Carousel but it's hard to here the singing and we don't really know the complete order and it's very fast. We're gonna do Message In A Bottle (Police) and some other good songs and hopefully we can perform in Battle of The Bands coming in August I think. Then Sunday I hung out with Heaton and played Metal Gear Solid all day. Today, nothing.
