I was quite surprised to discover I was growing a beard...   wait... make that I was quite in pain this morning after the cousin decided to pull on it...so its considerably more sparse than it was,   well, saves me shaving I suppose :/  The boredom is starting to get to me now... well, more precisely, its starting to get to me in between the bits where the cousin attacks me or starts screaming...  Yes, I know... I whine too much...  bah... >  Bleh...
