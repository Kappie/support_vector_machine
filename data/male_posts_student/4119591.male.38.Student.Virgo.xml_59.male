Product placement seems to have migrated from the visual media to electronic print outlets. From a WIRED  urlLink article :  Paid placement is a long-running issue with search engines. Google does not accept payment for ordering search results, while Yahoo does. But while newspapers and magazines have traditionally been loath to blend advertising and editorial, product placement is common on television and in movies. Yeah, right. Our local newspaper has runs a huge real estate section each Sunday that is quietly labled as a product "of our Advertisement Department" or some such.   I just want to make it clear, you know, for those who really care, that we at thompsonian*NET receive no incentives or cash from any company or organization in exchange for mention in our blog. That's why, for instance, I won't mention the fine products available from Winkley's Pharmaceuticals, makers of NutraMints -- "the mutli-vitamin that leaves your breath fresh as a summer breeze." Mmmm... good supplement.
