Bobby stole my ".Characters" thing anyway. So, that'll be coming up after.  Today was good. I can't remember ever having so many good days in a row. I dunno why though.  As of now, I'm talking to Damien. Damien pwnz me. Hells yeah.  Something new about Ydonia. The autopsy confirmed the report of a 'murder-suicide.' She shot her boyfriend, and then she shot herself. They say it might've been caused by financial problems, but I doubt it. My mom told me they found a suicide note, but they haven't released it to the public. It's eerie when something like this hits so close to home. You expect there to be a big headline that reads "LADY ONCE YOUR AUNT GOES CRAZY AND SHOOTS HER BOYFRIEND AND HERSELF" when it reads "Woman kills self an boyfriend." It's also strange to think her whole life was meant to end in a car in a Target parking lot.  Blah. Maybe one of these days I'll have something to talk about.   Flogging Molly - Devil's Dance Floor Lyrics   Her breath began to speak As she stood right in front of me The colour of her eyes Were the colour of insanity Crushed beneath her wave Like a ship, I could not reach her shore We're all just dancers on the Devil's Dance Floor Well swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o Swing a little more, a little more next to me Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor Pressed against her face I could feel her insecurity Her mother'd been a drunk And her father was obscurity But nothin' ever came From a life that was a simple one So pull yourself together girl And have a little fun Well she took me by the hand I could see she was a fiery one Her legs ran all the way Up to heaven and past Avalon Tell me somethin' girl, what it is you have in store She said come with me now On the Devil's Dance Floor Well swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o Swing a little more, a little more next to me Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor The apple now is sweet Oh much sweeter than it ought to be Another little bite I don't think there is much hope for me The sweat beneath her brow Travels all the way An' headin' south This bleedin' heart's cryin' Cause there's no way out Well swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o Swing a little more, a little more next to me Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor  I had a six paragraph analysis on this song done about an hour ago. It got deleted :(.  This verse always puts the picture of a big dance floor in front of me; it's crowded, and the main focus is on a guy. He stares across the dance floor into the eyes of some girl he doesn't know, and it's almost as though he sends a silent message to that he wants to dance. They dance, but she's still not interested in him, the line "Like a ship, I could not reach her shore" makes me think he wants more than just a dance. This verse starts the parallel between him and the girl and human desires. He wants more than he has, like any other human. From the first verse the "Devil's Dance Floor" is set up as a metaphor to life, but why are we all dancing on 'The Devil's Dance floor'?  On the Devil's Dance Floor He seems to be getting close to what he wants. The whole meaning of "The Devil's Dance Floor" changes though. The girl's past makes it seem like 'The Devil's Dance Floor' refers to the rules we've broken, and how we just have to keep dancing, or living our lives. This verse refers to the biblical story of Adam and Eve, and how Eve took the apple. She desired the apple, and bit it, just like how the guy really wanted the girl. The idea is that he gets the apple, but he's breaking rules. The verse concludes the lyric, and answers the question. Dancing on the devil's dance floor is a metaphor to life, and it basically means we're all living our lives and breaking rules, but we can't let that stop us from dancing. Wow, I put a lot of effort into that.
