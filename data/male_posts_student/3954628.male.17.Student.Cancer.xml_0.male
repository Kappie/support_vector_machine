In other news, I saw King Arthur and Anchorman this week; Anchorman was, I thought, pretty funny due to the hilarity of one of the characters (Brick) and King Arthur was, sadly, somewhat of a let-down as I expected something as epic, complex, and entertaining as  Gladiator  and I got something as profound as  Soul Plane  (even though I didn't watch it, I think I can guess here). It was interesting to see the knightly characters (Arthur, Lancelot, Gawain, Bors, Guinevere, Merlin, Galahad, Tristan) in a different, fainly Roman light, though. I would recommend them both if you have time to kill. Speaking of killing, I found out today from my GI doctor that I had a 50% chance of getting adhesions again in the next 2 years. That would make it my 3rd surgery in 2/3/4 years, depending if/when it hits. I have decided that I cannot possibly put up with the pain and crippling agony of this procedure once more and, should I require it again, refuse treatment and promptly commit suicide. So, should this blog stop suddenly and never continue, I'll leave you to guess at the outcome. 50% chance of death in 2 years. Sounds great. And I bet you thought YOUR life sucked.
