Not surprisingly, the only real poems I've written in the last two years or so, class assignments excluded, have been about Laura.  There's one in my other blog.  My problem is, whenever I write a poem I actually like, it's to personal for me to share with anyone.  I find I can't write poetry about something unless I really, deeply, care about it, in which case I can't share it. Getting back to the point, I really can't judge because I just can't get into that form of poetry.  I don't know enough about what makes it 'good' -- seems pretty arbitrary to me.  My question is, do you perform it, or are you being judged purely on the writing? Lara - don't you think Tiny Explosions fits Sophia's title scheme better? Marten - It's Larry.  Rachael's doing speech, and he's offered to help out like our dad is. Secret soul, by the way, is a super cool duet from "Jane Eyre the Musical" SQUEE!
