I had to wake up early (for me) to go check out a new house with my wife.  Those of you who know me know that Me + Morning = Argh.  We got to the house on time, to find the realitor (sp?)waiting for us.  When we got out of the car, he introduced himself to me, and completely ignored my wife.  He didn't even offer so much as a handshake to her, yet he was talking to me like I was a slot machine about to pay off big time.  Anyone who has ever been in a long term relationship with an American female knows that this is an error of the deadly sort.  Especially since she has just graduated from college (i go back in the fall) and will be paying a good chunk (read: most) of the bills.  He proceded to show us the house, which was quite nice, but the battle was lost from the initial charge.  We (he and I) shook hands and parted ways.  My wife proceded to verbally eviscerate him once we were safely in the car and away.  On top of this, I had to work that night on less that 4 hours of sleep, and in the process, was going to miss a chance to meet a man who plays a pivotal role in getting the music I like to the world stage.  I am of course speaking of Ian McKaye, singer, songwriter, and guitar player for the DC band  urlLink Fugazi , not to mention founder of the indie cornerstone  urlLink Dischord Records .  His work is very important to me personally, and I was sorely dissapointed by the fact that there was no way (short of quitting my job) that I was going to get to meet him, that night anyway.  I arrived at work on time, resigned to my fate, and got set up with a cash drawer for my shift.  (6PM-1AM) When I got out to the check-out counter, the normaly stoic Arianna O. seemed to be excited about something.  I asked her what was going on. "The Flaming Lips are in the store." "You're shitting me." "Nope, look over there." Sure enough, there was Wayne Coyne, singer, songwriter, and guitarist (among many many other things) of the  urlLink Flaming Lips , perusing our wide selection of cds and movies.  Well, I'd like to tell you all that I was totaly cool about him coming up to the counter and checking out.  Sadly, this was not the case.  I rang him out, and he commented on the fact that we give out a free magazine with every purchase.  I said something completely stupid like "Yeah, ain't free stuff cool?"  He bought a couple of CD's and a DVD of The Wizard Of Oz.  I had almost completed the transaction without making  too  big a fool of myself, when the guy with him (I think it was their drummer, my sincere apologies for not knowing you guys all on sight, Wayne has had more pictures taken of him.) commented on the Wesley Willis CD in our employeee picks section.  I took them both over and showed them the DVD that Willis just put out, and the other guy purchased it.  Arianna was helping him out when I made my move.   I walked up to Wayne and apologised for intruding on his personal time, and then introduced myself.  He introduced himself and said he was glad to meet me, and I told him that I was a huge fan of their work.  He thanked me for supporting them, and I asked why they were in town.  They are going to be doing a concert, but not for a couple of weeks yet.  Wayne said that their bus driver had some sort of sudden problem with a tooth, and they had stopped on their way to Portland to see if they could get him helped out.  I am pretty sure I wished them luck, but I was acting like such a star-struck moron that I am not sure I even did that.  Of course, I had absolutely none of their CD's in my car, having just pulled them out two days before to make a couple of mix discs for my trip to Japan this summer.  They left to go get some dinner, and I thanked them and said goodbye.  Later on that evening, I scraped together enough cash to buy the new 7 inch they put out with Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots on it.  I took it out to their tour bus, still parked in front of the store, and Wayne gladly signed it for me.  I would have been happy with a scribble, cause I know what it is like to be put out of your plans by sudden unexpected problems, but Wayne wrote a little personalized note on it, and drew smiley faces next to my name.  He even said to bring the disc back when they come to do the show, and he would have the rest of the band sign it.  My face hurts from grinning for the rest of the day. What can I even say.  Wayne  the Lips, thank you so much for pulling my day out of the doldrums at the last minute.  You guys rule.  What fantastic people.
