Speaking of music Avril Lavigne's back, how queer... I think her song is about like losing her virginity or something thats what It sounds like to me... hmmm. Bloody Lavigne! I should be revising now cause my mum is angry at me cause I invited Xav and Nick around at 2... so like I'm missing an hour and a half of regular school time (SHOCK SHOCK HORROR HORROR) meh, I said I would make it up tomorrow, do and extra hour and a half. Im bored, but this song is keeping me happy. Ummm... My tutor's coming soon, hes going to go through some physics with me *sigh*, I know that at some point today my mum is going to town so I can be lazy and play computer games *smiles*. Staaaacy cant you see your just not the girl for me. Heh, cathcy like RIGHT THERE! Speaking of which, I was watching (by the way this has nothing to do with that catchy line so its not "speaking of which" really) but anyhow yes, I was watching the new Velvet Revolver video on Kerrang! last night, it was quite cool but I noticed Slash (at least I'm assuming its Slash considering he looks exactly the same as he always does) and then after that this retro-old Guns'N'Roses video came on and I swear to god it was EXACTLY the same slash apart from a different logo on the shirt. He had the same hair, same guitar, same leather pants, same glasses, same facial expressions, same movement... it was odd, and for some reason Axl Rose had no pants on, just these tight red lycra shorts... *shudders*. Im outie before my mother catches me.
