As soon as my blogging tools get back up and running, you can expect a few changes.  Nothing drastic, just a few changes to make my blog more interesting.  Unfortunately, I still can't blog correctly, for as I have said, I DON'T HAVE MY FORMATTING BUTTONS!!!  I'm kind of bothered by that.  Over on David's blog, "My Own Newspaper," I have been listed as the top blog for last week, even through my blogging difficulties.  Now I must defend my title...  I realize that there has been an unfortunate lack of political posts lately (and really a lack of posts in general).  I am very busy at present; I have about five e-mails to write, comments to place on other people's blogs, and about twelve acres of grass to cut.  Not to mention my LACK OF FORMATTING BUTTONS ON MY PUBLISHING PAGE!!  It really makes it hard to blog since I can't post links.  I really hope Blogger gets this stuff fixed soon.    Have any of you been experiencing problems publishing your blogs?  Tell me if you have or haven't, and let me know what browser you use (as in, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox, etc.).  I'm using Internet Explorer 6.0, which means my new improved publishing page should work.  But as I have said before, IT DOESN'T!!  Soon I will be going out of town for a week or more (I'm not quite sure how long I will be gone), and I will not be able to blog.  Therefore, I will be on hiatus.  At present, I am only on a semi-hiatus, since I still post, though I'm not posting very frequently.  While I am on hiatus, please visit some of the blogs on my blogroll.  They all rock.  While you're at it, visit David Sessions's blog and website.  And don't forget to vote in my poll.  Well, I must go now.  I have to go cut a whole lot of grass, and I don't have much time to do it in.    Be blessed! Neo
