Even though I promised to update this damned thing every day, or at least as often as possible, It's hard for me to come up with something to say - especially when tired. So... Music! At the moment, I'm listening to "The Velvet Underground" - not a band I'd really taken any notice of until a friend spent a long time ranting about them to me, after which I felt it my duty to listen to at least one of tracks. Actually, I was suprised - they are quite good. I recommend a brief trip to the shops for all of you. Album title - "Andy Warhol" (Don't ask why, I don't know).  Ah well, that's about all I have to say at the moment - I'm off to Greece on Friday - so I won't be around until the 25th, though there is one computer I can use in the first week, so I'll try and update then! Anyway... Till tomorrow.
