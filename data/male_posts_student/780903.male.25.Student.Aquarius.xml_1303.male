And: for the holiday, I feel like doing another all-request day, just to get some inspiration.  How about I give you a theme: "things you want my opinion about."  Obviously my expectation is that if anyone bothers to e-mail me, it'll be something along the lines of, "how should I prepare for LSAT," but I'd also (and perhaps even more so) be pleased with an excuse to write about something random that I just wouldn't think of, like my opinion about low-carb milk.  Furthermore: The. Mets. Are. Temporarily. Good.  (This is unusual.)
