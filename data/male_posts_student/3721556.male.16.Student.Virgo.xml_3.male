Is that just a little fucked up to anyone? Kids walking around with their pants past their ass, girls with thongs(ick) showing past their pants, kids dealing drugs in school. I mean, they say how they're cracking down on drugs???? Thats total shit! If i wanted some pot, or coke, i could walk down the street and get it if i wanted too! It's ridiculous, and i think alot of it is to blame on MTV. Supid mtv makes it look cool to have your ass hang outta your pants, and that its cool for a young girl to have sex with older men and do drugs and drink and all that stupid shit that you godamned idiots are doing lately! I mean, all the scum in my school(abington heights) like the druggies and drug dealers, and older pervs are the ones that get the girls now! Any kid with some brains, refuses drugs, and dates people HIS AGE, is very unlikely to ever be considered by any women. Fortunatly, im one of the few lucky ones that has found a girl that actually has morals and such :). Stupid rap videos preach  smoke pot, blah blah, pimp my 15 year old 9th grade girls, blah blah, im a player, blabbity blah, i didnt get past fifth grade homie! . It's total shit, and someones gotta stop it. How do i know all this? because for the past month of school, i was thrown into the thick of it. I was transferred from public school to some kinda stupid military charter school crap. And you shoulda seen the kids there. All the big drug dealers and such were surrounded by girls! I had to put up with wiggers and drug dealers, whores and skanky 13 year olds. No NO, i was never hit on by them (thank you god, if you;re up there) But i got shit because i wear tight black jeans and a jacket with patches all over it instead of wearing an over sized baseball jersey with a marijuana leaf on the front and my pants at my ankles? They say that they're tolerant of all people, because their whole rap culture is mixed race i guess, but all day i got shit for my clothing, my music, "why your shoes so weird son?" was a comment made towards my combat boots. "why you gotta wear them red suspenders dog?" ya know what i wanna say to them? "WHY CAN'T YOU SPEAK PROPER ENGLISH YOU RETARD?!?!?!? grrrrrr, i hate it, and i dont want my kids growing up with this shit, because i'll be godamned if they turn out like that.    anyhoots, thanks for listening to me, nobody else will :p
