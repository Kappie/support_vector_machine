Just as i start getting into, shall we say, alternative forms of stimulation, the pesky folks in parliament start changing the law so that its now either illegal or else just more difficult to get hold of (the law is vague). I remember it well when it was realised that so long as you didnt prepare magic mushrooms in anyway, they were perfectly legal and you could shovel fields of the stuff into your gob without any legal repercussions, only psychological ones, whereby the cows start dancing and the hills really do come alive with the sound of music. It appears that, just as with cannabis, the government dont want our youth doing any kind of drugs which they dont make somesort of profit on (VAT), leaving only cigarettes and alcohol for us kids to consume. So, after just one highly enjoyable halucinogenic experience, my experiments with the humble psilocybe may be brought to a premature close. So if im not going to get any sort of legal high, might as well start smoking crack then eh?
