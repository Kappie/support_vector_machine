I hate my life, I hate my god damn english teacher. She gives me detention for no reason and now I'm punished for a week, given to me from my dad...I hate them all. I hate not having control of what I want to do. I don't want to listen to the bullshitting dike phony teachers or the cops, or the superior authority. I don't want parents, elders or peers to listen to, I want to listen to myself, I want to make choices in a world where anything is fucking possible without god dam communist fuckers coming into my life and start telling me what to do. I hate going to detention and having some 100 year old lady tell me what to do, I can't even fucking rest my neck and my neck is injured. I hate getting in trouble for laughing in Italian. I hate getting my seat switched because I talk too much. I hate teachers asking you where the fuck you're going every inch you step. I hate everything aspect of school and life. I just want to hang out with friends and have a decent job that doesn't take brains to get and live happily and normal. God damnit, I can even become a professional drummer and make millions, and I don't need to even go to school. I hate no being able to say "gay" and the fact the gay people alliance come in and have this gay orientation with all the classes and the gay guy says all the stereotypes are fake meanwhile he's doing all of them while he's speaking. I can't wait until I'm out of this shithole, let's just hope this shithole explodes. I hope armaggedon comes so people like me can be put out of their misery. The sad part about it all is I don't stand up for anything. I hold it all in, one day I'm going to snap. If you're reading this, do not tell anyone, especially adults. But if they do see this, go ahead, let them put me in a mental home, but that isn't possible. I will be gone, far far gone away from this land before they can catch me, or I'll be dead. Sorry if this is disturbing you but as you can see my day is horrible and now I'm admitting all the things horrible with my life. That's why I've been inflicting my pain on some people, sorry Heaton, if you're reading this, this is the explanation. I can't stand my life anymore even though chances are in a week I'll be fine again but deep inside I'll have the inevitable feeling of disgust and pity of the world, thinking everything isn't fair in life. I wish I could say "For now on, I'm doing anything I want to do, and nobody can stop me," but I'm afraid. Control scares me. Oh goody, the new Matrix Online site has finally launched! haha, screw all the shit I just said, I'll be swimming in money when I become a pro drummer so why worry about school!
