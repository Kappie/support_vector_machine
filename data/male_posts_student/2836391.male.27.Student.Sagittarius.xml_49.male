On Friday night after work I went ten pin bowling with friends, on Saturday had a few people over to watch some DVD's, and last night after church had more people over for cards. My house is becoming the venue for people to gather after the evening service. Its great to have the house full of people having fun, although it does mean a late night, and then an early start in the morning!  Last night's service was extra special as it was my friend Natalie's baptism. I have known Natalie for quite a few years, and it was so great to see her take this step in her faith walk. Natalie is an amazing person, she is blessed with so many talents, and an amazing faith. She's one of my favourite people in all the world, and it was so good to be able to share this special time with her.   Raindrops Keep Fallin On My Head   The situation which I described last week is not improving. I've been receiving different advice from different friends on how I should handle things. Some say I should talk to the person involved, and try to sort it out that way, others are saying I should leave them to come around in their own time. What makes it hard is that this is someone I have strong feelings towards, and the fact that things have worked out the way they have hurts. But life must go on, and I can only hope that in time she comes round, and things go back to where they were.
