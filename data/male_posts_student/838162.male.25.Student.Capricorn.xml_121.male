Hopefully it will pass by soon. I’ve got magazines and textbooks to read, games to play and a bed to sleep in, yet I’m struggling to write out something here.      >     On another sad note, former US president Ronald Reagan  urlLink passed away  last night. Being the first US president that I remember while growing up, Reagan will always stand in my mind as the idea leader of that country. While his politics may not have been agreeable with everyone, his leadership skills and presence, I believe, has seen no equal since. Truly an end of an era, but in a way there is relief that he no longer has to suffer through such a terrible and heart-wrenching  urlLink disease .          >     Caught game 5 of the  urlLink Stanley Cup  finals that are going on now. Never really had the chance to sit down a watch a proper Ice Hockey game from start to finish, so it was a real trill. Helped that it was a terrific game as well.  So my interest in the game got pushed back up a notch. Maybe I should look into getting a copy of the NHL 2004 game. But more importantly, maybe its time that I take up sports again. Doesn’t have to be hockey since I don’t think the leg injury I got while in the army can withstand the punishment, but I don’t think cycling, swimming and gym once in awhile is enough. On top of that, a team sport would be good way to expand my social circle, as  Someone  so “helpfully” suggested I do. As if I didn’t know that and am not trying. Still the question remains as to what sport to take up. Knowing my taste in the exotic and unusual, as well as the mentioned injury, finding something that fits would not be easy.   Then again…perhaps  urlLink this one  may be a good place to start.
