I have one, Shu Ling has many, Shu Ying has one, and even Chee Weng has one. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT???  I guess blogspot will be very happy with the sudden jump in ppl blogging. But now i have no idea which blog i should post my messages in. Should i post in Shu Xia's tag board, my tag board or my own post?  I have been regularly posting new entries into my blog, but whether i can continue when school reopens remains to be seen. The hectic school life may just interrupt my blogging career.   My Mummy just bought tons of Breadtalk bread back, feeling hungry again, will be eating soon. The potato chips bought on Sunday may be in my stomach while i watch the England vs Switzerland match. It depends. Food Food Food.   This entry is kindda boring. Dont u think?
