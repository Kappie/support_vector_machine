But I have heard a handful of his songs.  Last night I was checking out iTunes, and they now have music videos.  Not much of a selection, but a few.  I watched one by Eminem called Sing for Tomorrow, based upon an Aerosmith song.    That's when I decided that he actually had talent (and all of this is assuming he writes his own material, which is what I've heard).  I think precious few 'rappers' are more than just no-talent thugs pandering to a no-brain audience.  In listening to Eminem, I hear someone who really has something to say, albeit in a form I don't really appreciate.  So in the end, I respect him as an actual artist.
