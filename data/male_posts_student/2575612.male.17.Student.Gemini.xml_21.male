Nothing has been altered, this is exactly how i wrote it that night back then...i actually was in a hotel bathroom, sitting on the toilet.  not using the toilet, sitting!  haha ~benn.   Where You Think the Best   During the cool summer night, While you lie on the soft grass, Gazing at God's beautiful night sky. Thats where you think the best Thats where you think the best  During the coldest winter nights, While you lie next to a warm fireplace, You float among the scarlet embers burning with delight Thats where you think the best Thats where you think the best  During the quiet sleepless nights, While you lie in your bed staring blankly at the ceiling Reminiscing over the good times, and bad time, Thats where you think the best Thats where you think the best
