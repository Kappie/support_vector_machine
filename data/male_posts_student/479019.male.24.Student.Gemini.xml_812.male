I helped Inhye with some interpretation of handwriting, and went to a potluck with Melissa. Then we watched  Breakfast at Tiffany's . I'm not sure if I get that movie. There's the whole call girl / gigelow angle along with being a "real phony." Also I'm not so sure about the whole "belonging" to someone when it comes to love.   Ok so yea... is there such a thing as being real? I really think in a way we're all real phonies. Do we really know what we want in life? Holly Golightly thought she did? In the end she had to re-evaluate everything (even herself). We can say that we want something and when we get it, not like it. It can be something as simple as a restaurant order, or something as complicated as relationships.  In my old age, I've become very skeptical about my wants and desires. I think it says a lot, when even the skeptic / cynic is hoping for something.  Who knows what the future holds?  LOTR (overrated) is kicking ass and winning lots of Oscars. No surprise?  ***
