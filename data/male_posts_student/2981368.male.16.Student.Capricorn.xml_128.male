They had 2 penalty calls turned down (retarded ref didn't see either of those blatant Kraut fouls).  Holland look like they're doing OK, last time I checked they were 2-1 up against the Czech Republic.  And that Swedish G-T-G was great! Everyone kept falling over trying to head it (in laughable ways) before Ibrihimovic flicked it behind him with such style. Go Sveeden!  No work today (working tomorrow instead) so I went shopping. Erm, yay. What...incredible...fun? Hell no. Argh. Though I did find out something really funny. That idiot who crashed into our car was...A CLOWN! Woohoo!
