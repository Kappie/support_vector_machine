And...sorry if I'm just repeating the sentiments expressed by countless others before me...I just need to write this.  War...OK...we've finally done it. We've reached that inexorable point of no return. Iraq has been invaded, the front lines are drawn, "Operation Iraqi Freedom" has officially begun. Freedom, true...but at what cost? Less than a week into the war, and official counts estimate over four times the Allied deaths (22) to Iraqis (5). Our president initially stated this war effort would be quick and decisive, a concerted, explosive effort that would "shock and awe" the poor defenseless Iraqi soldiers, our "30+" allies, and our many dissenters. Unfortunately for his case, many Iraqis are indeed not very defenseless, they are fighting back; they feel more strongly and stirringly the pride of their country (which our side, which has persistently urged Iraqi surrender, has apparently disregarded) than any sort of universally moral decision to aid the ousting of their president. It is without question that Saddam Hussein is some of the worst sort of scum to exist on this planet; he has gassed his own civilians, used them as human shields, and even killed his personal advisors when they dared to disagree with him. Nevertheless, it is folly to assume that Iraqis aren't prideless; it is folly to assume they aren't human.   Three days into the war, Bush has finally, officially stated that this war will be prolonged. We have only seen the beginning of what may be a drawn-out conflict. Which is absolutely the worst possiblity that could happen to him. How has he gained his 70% approval rating in the country? By assuring the American populace that action in Iraq will be swift and results will be swifter. We will immediately oust Saddam out of power, all of his progeny, and all supporters of his outdated, suppressive, oppressive will. We will immediately institute a new, revolutionary, democratic regime that will restore a decent life for all Iraqis. But look at Afghanistan. We promised the same thing to them, we promised years of rebuilding and funding. Where are they now? Where is the US for them? Look at Cuba. Some help we've been to their smothered society. How about North Korea? They're starving and dying daily. What are we doing for them? Are the Iraqis really that much more important than other human beings? And the answer is no. They might all possibly be prioritized the same, had the same creed attached to them -- All men are created equal -- if only for the fact that Iraqi feet stand on the soil through which black gold flows. Bush may vehemently deny this point, but it is only because of this fact that he is sending our troops overseas so fast and so intensely. Why else did we secure Iraqi oil fields within a day or two of the start of this mission? I would hope that American lives are worth more than that.  Carlos Mencia said that people like to laugh, that it is what keeps us human, but that at the end of the day we should realize what real life is and appreciate it and make the most of it. You live only once, you have no restarts or refunds or exchanges for items of equal or lesser value. Indeed, Emily Dickinson once wrote, "That it will never come again/Is what makes life so sweet." Here in the United States we've been living in more or less a sheltered dream world for many years; this generation has not experienced the devastation of war, the agony of loved ones lost overseas in the defense of their country, the swelling of patriotic pride that comes when true, unmitigated victory has been claimed over the enemy. Most importantly, even with all of today's kids headed in the wrong direction, with our chronic and grave society-related problems that are causing an overflow of untimely death -- shootings, rape, robbery -- until September 11, until now, we have not fully understood the delicate fragility of life. Do we now? Has war really helped us in that one regard? I hope so, I pray for it. If nothing else, let the events of today remind us all how lucky we are for what we have, and how wickedly easy it could be to lose it. You've heard it before, you're hearing it again, and you will hear it endlessly for the rest of your lives...cherish those dear to you just that much more, only if because they can never be replaced. Their faults, their virtues, their silliness, their loyalty, their impossiblities, their pleasantries, their lives, their love. Because sometimes...
