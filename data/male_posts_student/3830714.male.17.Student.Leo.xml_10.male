I woke up at 11 30 in the morning(actually wanted to sleep longer) to wash up as my project work members are coming to my house for project work meeting. Guess what we meet about? Some lamers told us that we need to hand in the written report draft by this week! We did not know how to go about doing it as we don't know the layout. So, we called Ms azian(or Mdm Azian if you like it). She told us that all she need is our evaluation pieces as we will be having the written report lecture later on!!! Instead of calling the meeting off, we carry on to make our rough draft. After my project work meeting, i headed for my 4A(2003) class gathering at Orchard road.   urlLink    Yummy yummy.. food!!!  There are only 20 people( Some lamers last minute say cannot come), wonder why is it still call class gathering. Anyway, instead of eating at the Seol garden, we ended at Swensen(10 times better off than seol garden).    urlLink        Oh man... Loser need to drink a sip of 'orange juice'! Ingredients: Water, chilly sauce, tomato sauce, pepper, salt... and maybe a little bit of... saliva?   urlLink       Yuck!!! Gerard got to drink it, no choice... haha!   It was actually quite a boring gathering as there's nothing for us to talk about. But i would not consider it as a wasted trip, at least i can still keep in touch with them.
