Such forms are things such as "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may" or even the original saying that all of these come from "Carpe Dium" which is a latin phrase that means "Sieze the Day". It tells you to take as much out of life as you can. That is a sentiment that is needed to be told to all people and that must be reciprocated throughout all of humanities history. This sentiment si what drives people such as JFK and other great figures. If we follow this advice we can take advantages of as many opportunities in our lives as we possibly can.
