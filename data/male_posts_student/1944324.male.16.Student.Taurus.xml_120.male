Erin: um, sorry, I figured once you had told him it would be alright, I thought it might help the situation in general if he knew exactly what the problem was.  Woohoo! Nates got a date! I claim it as a personal victory that had nothing to do with me.  See above exclamation! Jonah has updated the toaster story! Another personal victory. All points revert to me. I dont think Lara counts as a character in this little webcomic, as she no longer exists other than an odd gag about a book tour in a random location.  Its thanksgiving, and I am in the last place I want to be, but its good anyway cuz Matt's good at painting models. He's working on Tau right now, only nathan or jonah will know what I mean, but who cares?  Hey Thomas! Find something interesting and post about it! I want to see that catchy little title scheme again. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!
