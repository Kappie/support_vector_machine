But when Vieri et al disappears from the game, erased by Martin Laursen and his friends in the Danish defense, there's not much left to do for the Italians. Italy had some opportunities to score in both halfs both the Danish keeper Thomas Sorensen played had a great game.  As Gianluigi Buffon also had. The Great Danes (pun intended), with two of their top midfielders missing, played a nice game with good movement and passing. I think Morten Olsen had a nice sleep this night, Giovanni Trapattoni hadn't.  My Man of the Match: Martin Laursen.
