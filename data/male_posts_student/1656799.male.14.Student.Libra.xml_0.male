Right nowI can't really reveal too much until me and James have a clear set of guidelines and limits for this bet, so he can actually win.  The purpose of this blog is simple -- we use it as the main page for the whole site and report how the bet is going. It will feature commentary from both me and James as we need comedy, don't we all?  The message board shall be sorted out tomorrow as soon as I get the time, and we will begin the archiving of what we already have.  Expect all to be known tomorrow.
