Why don't you just tell me to take less breaths of air and work on sleeping only 2 hours a week.  Carbohydrates are my friend, and I want them to be in my life (and stomach) forever.  So my chicken is in the background right now, cooking itself to go into my carb-starved tummy.  I wonder if when I meet with him next (tomorrow) he'll somehow be able to tell by looking at me that I shoved half of a cheese pizza in my mouth last night, followed by a bag of chocolate covered raisins at a movie.  All of this happening well past 7pm (which is when I have to have. my last carbohydrate eaten for the day.  Yeah, snacking on "protiens" after7pm isn't fun.  I'm sure it's perfectly socially acceptable to wander into a movie and eat a t-bone or a chicken breast instead of popcorn.  Why not?  Mmm actually that whole-wheat-tortilla-fajita wasn't that bad.  Reminds me of the time I ate dirt on accident with a lil' salsa on the side.  My home phone is ringing but I don't answer it anymore.  I've decided that I will only use my cell phone.  I removed all features such as caller ID, call waiting, and so on from my home line.  I kind of like hearing it ring, knowing someone is trying to get ahold of me and can't.  Call the cell, jackasses.  Did you know that Stacy's Mom Has Got It Going On?  Apparently her milkshake brings all the boys to the yard and they're like "it's better than yours."  It's weird, I know.  I don't really understand why she's got milkshakes in the yard.  I picture them melting pretty fast, afterall it has to be hot outside to want to drink a milkshake.  It's crazy to think that there are people out there with real talent, and then crap makes it onto the radio.  Oh, and then there's Creed.  Yep, Creed.  I'll go there, I'll bring it up.  I'm sure they're talented, more talented than the milkshake bitch, but c'mon.  Watching Creed (that's what I call the lead singer because I don't care to remember his name) fall off cliffs in leather pants is getting old.  Speaking of cliffs, that's one thing I would not do.  Well on purpose anyway, you know the whole bungy thing.  I don't even think I spelled it right, THAT'S how much I don't want to do it.. I can't even bring myself to spell it right.  Do people even bungy jump off of cliffs?  Well regardless, I don't think I'll be trying that anytime soon.  I'm scared of everything.
