I feel it enter my body and lodge itself inside. Eventually, I work up the strength to reach in my hand to pull it out, but it has grown to the size of a large rifle shell. Every time I reach for it, it slips inbetween my stomach and liver, and I feel them get pushed out of the way. I remain very calm throughout this. (I can't remember where I was and what I was doing while this all happened) At the end of the dream, the pointy bullet tip is sticking out of my bellybutton. I reach for it and it shrinks back inside.        info.link: urlLink http://www.astrobio.net/news/article966.html
