Typical Day in Lalaland.        I'm sitting at the rollarcoasters engine, trying to figure out what to do to make it even faster than it already is, when I see Alec, who runs the hotel, run very fast past me. I quirked my eyebrow, and walked in the opposite direction from which Alec was running. I see that all my fellow co-workers and friends are standing in front of a blazing inferno *KOOOOL!* Then I relized that it was a fire of fun and prettiness *which it usually is* and that it is actually the hotel. I knew know one else was there at the moment, cause it's MCAS time, dont cha know, and that people weren't burning alive. Erm. Anyways, I turned to Mandy, who runs the gift shop and asked "What happened here?!!??!?!?" She doesn't answer me, so I turn to my friend Gage, who runs the tea shop, and see him stareing at Alec, who as just run back with a strange looking charactar by the collar. "Fix this, Camo!" Camo, the weird guys name, (Camo: I am not weird!!! Me: Shut up *throws random object...and misses*)says with an attitude, "And what if I don't wanna?" Alec gives him a serious look and says in a stern voice, "Then I'll make you face Katt on DDR 1 million google times." Camo looks horror stricken then, and fianlly gives in and says, "Fine!" I stood back and watched Camo laugh manically as he put the flames out and Gage rolling his eyes, saying under his breath, "Pryo/hydromaniacs..." I saw that the entire hotel was burnt to a crisp. "Bye!" Camo shouted, just as the hotel re-appeared again *POOF!* only, this time it was green. So, at the end of the day, we all went back to our jobs, and I just tried and tried to figure out the rollarcoasters guts spilled out all over the floor. The end! PS-Camo is not the antagonist in the story. He's like both! (protagonist I meam)  -Dilussional Child-
