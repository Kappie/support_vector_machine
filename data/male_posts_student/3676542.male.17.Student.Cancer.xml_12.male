Wat a pain.haha..Hope i can pass it this year.Wish me luck bah.    Life is like a drama Fate bring us together Isn't easy to stay together for ever Learn to appreciate what you have right now Don't upset over a small matter Think again,is it worth it Drama has its' own climax Different drama,different climax In my life,my climax,slowly increasing When would it be the greatest For now and ever My greatest climax would be loving you yet knowing I be with you If i would to end the drama with many climax I know that,no matter wat climax I have in the future Loving you would still be the greatest climax     我會學著放棄你﹐是因為我太愛你 周杰倫
