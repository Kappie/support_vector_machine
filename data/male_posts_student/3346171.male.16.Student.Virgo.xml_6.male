I'll not do anything today and tomorrow, just watch TV, read a book, sleep...  I'm not feeling very good today, there is a horible headache knocking on m head, and is so cold ourside, I wanted to rent a movie but i spent all my money on a chocolate cake last night - i'm ashamed - i bought it because yesterday afternoon and fell sleep and had a dram about a chocolate pie, isn't it wierd?! When i wake up i felt in the obligation of buying that. And i ate that watching a Tv program named "eLove", it's very nice, it's about people who meet in the internet and they plan a trip to somewhere.   A friend of mine called me today morning to go to her place and have lunch tomorrow, I'm really not in the mood to take a bus and "act", that's what i have to do when i'm in a place where i don't know the people, i mean, her mom and brothers will be there, and i feel really imbaraced, so i sad that I was a headache and i wasn't in the feeling, in fact, my mom did lasanha, and I love italian food, i couldn't miss that.  Every year, my school goes to Porto Seguro, it's in Bahia, in northeast of Brazil, and my friends went and I didn't, this year they start - already - to say that I'll have to go, and I really would like to, now, i'll have to save every single coin i find, and i know i'll have to spend the money from my saving - :( -, i didn't want that, but Porto Seguro is all the good things in world, and we - me and my friends - will drink tons of caipirinha, which i love the most, it'll be awesome!
