Heres some stuff I picked up:  - He broke 35 different bones at some point or another - He once tried to jump a canyon in a firework - His last jump was in Wembley Stadium - His cool walking stick was worth as much as the BBC studio - He got in a big argument with the Blue Peter staff - He made BILLIONS from toys 'n' things  Today was boring. Until now. See if you can figure out wtf me and Nat are talking about here. Answer'll be posted tomorrow if I remember.  Nat: Tractor? Ben: a little too insane. Ben: hovercraft? Nat: COOL. Ben: but are they road-liscened? Nat: I think so... Ben: that'd be pretty cool Nat: It would be way cool. Ben: not as cool as a chopper Nat: Nah. But we're too poor for a chopper -__- Ben: not suprising really. Nat: Mmm Ben: not gonna stop me from trying  Ben: lol. horseback Nat: Yeah! Nat: Double bike. Ben: now THAT would be funny Nat: Micro Scooters. Ben: go karts! Nat: WOOHOO Ben: lol Ben: milk floats? Nat: Even better. Ben: like one of those big converted ones they use in disney parades Nat: Damn it, that would almost beat the chopper. Ben: with a mini-laser show attached Ben: wow Ben: police car would be funny Nat: *slobbers*
