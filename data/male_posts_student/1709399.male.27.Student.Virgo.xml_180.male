French seems to be a very interesting language . English owes most of its words to Anglo-Saxon ( German in old days)  French . Thus learning French would make one an expert etymologist in English. Learnt Days of the week , Months of the year , Numbers , Verbs , Pronouns  nouns . The pronunciation remains sketchy though . However , learning a new language it lot of fun  interesting.
