Bessides the whole slacking off on jogging this weekend and not eating healthy since I've been back... I think I should try to be a better person. I don't think I'm necessarily mean... especially compared to some friends, but I have a horrible habit of analyzing people and noticing their "quirks." This includes people who are important to me on all levels, which makes me feel guilty about doing that. I guess being a sociologist the whole analyzing thing comes in handy, but I think at times I do it at inappropriate times and oftentimes I should just keep my mouth shut. As G.I. Joe says... "knowing is half the battle." I know this is a flaw, but I have another half of the battle to go.  I've got work tomorrow at 11 AM... I get to sit around alone in the office... fun eh?  Oh yea... fucking QG4 has a damn error that keeps me from finishing the game.  ***
