Nació en Valencia el 11 de junio de 1981 y se inició en el fútbol en 1991 con el CD Benicasim y en la temporada 1993-94 se incorporó al CD Castelló, donde ha desarrollado la mayor parte de su carrera deportiva, empezando como infantil y acabando en el primer equipo.   Ok for all of you who don't know Edgar that well he is half Spanish and is dad, the Spaniard is from Castellon. So if Edgar supports one team in the world it is Castellon and I think that there are more pictures of Edgar on Castellon web page than any player in the team. Also you don´t have to know Edgar all that well to know that his last name is Benicasim. Sodoes Captain Europe have his own personal team.... Respond.  Anyways got drunk last weekend, nothing much to say expect that I did hit serioulsy on my bosses sister... Goooooooooooood  Úlli
