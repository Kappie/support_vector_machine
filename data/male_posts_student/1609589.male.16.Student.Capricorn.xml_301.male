I think I've just ruined my relationship with about everyone at my church besides Dustin.  I got sick and tired of them always pressuring us to goto rallies(which is a 3-day lockin with pretty much no sleep(or if there is sleep, it's on an uncomfortable floor in a very noisy hall with people walking by all night))  Eric: "Okay, 3 day lockins are only cool like once a year" Me: "And with the kinds of people I don't usually hang out with, yeah"  You know the kinds of people that are so open-minded that they just loop back around to being closed-minded? Yeah, those are the kinds of people that go to those things.  Okay, so I'm angry at this point because they never just ask once, they send out separate emails about each group of rallies that are going to happen several months to a year from now. And, with each rally description, they make sure to mention how "fun" and how much of "a blast" they're gonna be, and how none of have any excuse to not goto the Halloween rally(except that the halloween rally is on a sunday, and I don't want to waste the only night my parents allow me to run around the streets at 11:00 at night wearing stupid costumes). This last one made me lose it.  Lotsa stuff was going through my head at this point- "Do they just not care that we have lives outside this church?" "We'll have homework at this point!" "WTFLMAOBBQ~!!11:LlOLolollLolOOL" "KHAAAAAAAAANNNNNN!!!!" **  You know how, in movies, a group will get together to go do something brave, like fight a bully, but when the leader of the group goes to challenge the big kid shaving his armpits in an elementary school bathroom, the rest of the group ditches him leaving him with his fists cocked- a David and Goliath situation where Goliath had a helmet on.  I never had that group. I'd sure like to wish i did, though. I did have a group. It was the gang from Mystery Science Theater 3000, because that was what was playing on my computer at the time. ****  I sent out an e-mail telling them basically to shut up, but in my own words(which, if this blog post is any indication, meant it was quite lengthy), detailing what I thought was wrong in this particular situation, and why.'  I went to sleep, cringing at the fact that this was going to leave quite a block of e-mails in my inbox.  It was just Nicholas and I for a while, flinging accusations and arguements at eachother, then Dustin replied(he seemed to be on the side of the people who were sick of hearing all this advertising), then Cheryl joined the fray, the new high-school graduate of the group, one of the two "senior" members of the class that still came. She got REALLLY pissed, and actually came out and called me an asshole, right after a quick "fuck you."  You'd think I would be offended, but actually I couldn't have been more pleased. You see, she is one of the only people I've ever met to cut the crap and tell me what she was REALLY thinking.  I left some comments back. I told them how christian churches have rallies(which they didnt know, i guess they REALLY like to hide the fact that Unitarian Universalists have obvious christian roots). I pointed out how they copied off the christians and called themselves original. Someone said "Well, if that's true, ours are more fun." To which I replied "Have you ever BEEN to a christian rally? Because I'm sure 10 minutes ago you didn't know they existed!"  Eric: "yeah thye all think they're better than anybody else, that's part of why I hate churches."  So now that I've realized that not even some of the most "open-minded" people I know have decided that opinions other than theirs are bad and that my views are "poison"(that's an actual quote there), I'm seriously considering   leaving Horizon Unitarian Universalist Church.    I was already having some problems with the actual "government" of the church, we still haven't resolved the conflict from when everybody overreacted to our church service the Youth did. For those of you who don't know about this part of the story, The minister was being a bit of a pansy when it came to talk about it, he was VERY reluctant to make a date where we can talk to him about everything he thought was wrong(all the reasons he gave were kind of dumb, besides 2). When we FINALLY got a date together, the night of the ACTUAL NIGHT where we were supposed to talk to him(which was put(purposely I realize now) on 6:00 of a Tuesday School night. When 4:00 rolled around, Someone sent out an e-mail to the youth that the date had been cancelled due to "lack of interest." BULLSHIT! ALL the class was attending! He just didn't want to talk about it!  That made Sarah and I REALLY angry. We didn't end up doing much, but boy did we make some damn good arguements, and we're gonna get this thing resolved, no matter how long it takes.  But now that I see that the problem has gotten so PERSONAL, I'm honestly considering leaving the church forever. I thought before this that, if the adults didnt interfere, I could still stay, because I have a bunch of friends here. I felt safe. I felt "in."  But now I know that opinions aren't accepted anymore. Anywhere. Sure, they're gonna read this and tell me to "stop taking this so seriously" and "we were just joking" and "come back, please!" when there IS nothing to take lightly in this situation- it DOESN'T MATTER HOW you say it, it's WHAT you say- and I'll only come back if I have some sort of guarantee that we'll all be respected for our opinions, no matter what it is(unless it hurts someone, or for other obvious reasons(i say this because otherwise someone would use that as an arguement against me)). Or, an apology.  Since they seem to love chatting over e-mail so much, I think they can do a couple more weeks without me while they sort these things out amongst themselves.  ---  I was looking up the word Faith in the dictionary earlier.  Me: Dogma was wrong Me: (the movie) Me: did you see it? Eric: It's a movie? Me: ... Eric: What's the definition of faith? Me: "Confident belief in the truth, value, or trustworthiness of a person, idea, or thing." Me: now, someone says in Dogma, "It doesn't matter, what you have faith in, its just whether you HAVE faith" Me: which is impossible Me: you have to have faith in something, or else the complete premise of faith is completely useless  Eric: that's more of a politically correct idea of faith Eric: ya know, the "all paths lead to heaven"  Me: here's another one: Me: "Loyalty to a person or thing; allegiance: keeping faith with one's supporters." Me: still implies that it's faith IN something Me: "The theological virtue defined as secure belief in God and a trusting acceptance of God's will." Me: IN god  Eric: yeah  ---  Me: Never mind, I'm starting my blog back up- this stuff needs to be said(same conversation as the earlier ones) Eric: damn right it does- that's why I liked your blog, it was the only one that actually said stuff that meant something. Eric: your blog is like a voice of reason for us Me: who is "us" though? Me: you, dustin, and *maybe* 2 people i know from flower mound Eric: its a small group Eric: but it's a group none-the-less  Damn right it is.  **-edited because Dustin would have wanted it that way ****- I was about to elaborate on this, but then I decided I would sound too much like an aging NPR talkshow host reading a story noone cares about
