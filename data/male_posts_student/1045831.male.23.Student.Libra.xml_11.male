Then a bunch of guys went to Quintons so I followed them over there.Got really really drunk.  Pulled out the phone.  Bad move when your drunk.  I talked to Niki and she decided to rive up.  I then went to the wheel were I remember very little but Fergi told me I talked to Megan Murphy for a while.  THen I was back to the house to meet Niki.  THe rest of the night is just blackness and I'm kinda glad.  I probably was did some embarrassing stuff.  well the next day i just kind of recovered and slept.  I was going to go see Andrew WK but the person I was going to go with backed out and then my car was blocked in so i just kinda watched a movie and chilled.  It was nice.  But today I have to go to the Push banquet but I am going to work out right now.
