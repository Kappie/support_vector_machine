I probably won't drink, though it is all ages, and i am not sure that i can handle the junior highers. i don't know. oh well my cheek still hurts, but i want it taken care of.  F. wants to introduce me to a guy this weekend, and that is not going to happen if i have a swollen face. no other real news than that cheers
