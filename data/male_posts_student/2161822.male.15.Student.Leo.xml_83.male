Anyway, after school me and Ryty went over Frank's house to jam. Actually didn't go that bad. They just have to learn some more songs and we'll be set. Last few days have been surprisingly nice. I was actually able to go outside and shoot hoops without getting pnemonia. And the ball stayed dry for more than one shot. But now today it had to rain. I hope we get no more snow ever. Bring on the summer. And now I am lacking things to write. Let's recap my day. Chemistry - Boring crap taught to us. Well, not really taught, more like our teacher writing it on the board (wrong to begin with), explaining it very poorly, and moving on with none of us knowing what just happened. Art - Eh, interesting. Test though, but everyone sorta fooled around. Not as bad as chem. Algebra II - Wow, this period sucked. Busy work galore. 56 factoring problems are enough to make me want to die. Spanish - Well, no bad day is complete without Spanish class. I swear this is the most boring and annoying class ever. History - Wow. You think it can't get worse than Spanish, but then you go to history. Double period too which makes everything even worse. Theology - Went to chapel. Did the stations. Listened to hokey music. Reflected. Listened to Joe sing. English - Project presentations. Not that bad, since none of the presentations were utterably horrendous. I was able to manage the last 40+ minutes of captivity and then finally I was free from the hell called school. So that is basically everyday of mine. Nothing changes. So exciting. So exciting...(drifts off and falls off chair) *zzzzzzzzzzz*  Listen to H.I.M.
