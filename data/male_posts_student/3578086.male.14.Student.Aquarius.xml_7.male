I mean I thought I could trust my best friend who I have known for donkeys years. Well any way he told my brother my most biggest secret (that I was gay) and well I feel cheated. I didn't want my family to know and now thanks to my best friend I am dying inside. So Sam Hayward I would like tot thank you. You have ruined my life thank you so much I hope you are happy!
