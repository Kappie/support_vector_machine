I found my headrests from my car in Aarons closet, he didnt even know I came to get them, we just walked in and found them hidden and left. Well seinor (spelling) year's comin on fast. Everythings gonna start getting hectic. I pray that everything will work out smooth and stress free, and i know i can make it happen. But there are some things in life that you need to jump at, and thank God for it, because anytime it could just slip away.
