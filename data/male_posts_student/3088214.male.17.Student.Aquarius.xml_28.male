And by the way, for any of you who may have trouble publishing your posts, after you click "publish blog", please do not hit the back key, for it may erase your post entirely.   In reading Henretta, I found it interesting that today's leisurely clothingstyles largely stemmed from the counterculture radical movements: when young men started to wear "coats and ties and women skirts and sweaters", and "youth defiantly dressed in unisex ragged blue jeans". This provides a great contrast to the clothingstyles of "old days" when even in the 50s everybody was still wearing very uptight clothes and the kids in school had to wear tight uniforms.   And  urlLink here is a link that may bring about some shock about the current cost of war in Iraq. I was surprised and never put into perspective how much money that cost of the war came to be .
