Think about a hungry dog, left out in the cold.  Leaving him to time, he'll get even hungrier, angrier, but then eventually die.  Is that what someone really wants?  A dead dog?  Sometimes to solve something, to get something, action is required.  At least an active interest in getting something.  But sure, time is a good thing.  Love and time is good, but thats too general.  Its about the slow advancements that happen during that time.  Just saying time isn't enough.  Nothing is implied.  Its all about what happens in that time and what you decide to do, what actions you take.  Sometimes actions are bad too.  But actions get things done.  It depends on what actually gets done can you determine if the action was beneficial.  A recent action in my case was telling Kim I wanted to be together with her.  To me it was beneficial, and I hope it was to her.  I believe that what happens between us during the time allowed between us will make a certain feeling blossom.  A good feeling.  So when I offer something, telling her things, those are my actions.  My ways of advancing the relationship in a simple way.  But if time is whats required, then I guess I might just have to ease up.  I just want the feeling to remain there.  I'm gonna keep moving on to talking about those ever present 'What Ifs'.  To me, your life is not bracketed with different possibilities.  Its a straight line.  I guess it is fate-like. Simple acceptance.  Only when you look back can you see the illusion of choice, like a pruned tree or fork of lightning.  By asking what if, you are trying to imagine being a different person, who would be asking a whole different set of questions.... or maybe the same.  Do you want to be a different person?  Change everything around?  I don't.  I'm going to accept my line.  Will you?  I like that you think highly of me, however you spoke of only my positives.  What about my arrogance?  My sarcasm?  My tendency to assume things?  And my 'not-a-Michalangelo's-David-Body' body?  I guess you don't mind.  The way I see it, I don't view your 'problems' as problems, but as quirks.  Our quirks also make us who we are, in addition to our positives.   You say you're moody and cranky?  Bah, I don't mind.  I like that sometimes.  You downplay yourself too much.  Its not a bad thing to be like that sometimes. What am I going to get in return?  I hope a meaningful relationship that doesn't break down.    Ah, we are different, yet the same, when you think about it.  I think that makes for a good catalyst.   Wow, that was a very meaningful post.
