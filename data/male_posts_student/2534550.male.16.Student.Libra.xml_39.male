I'm really beginning to dig our new uniforms. They're really beginning to grow on me. The blue with the white and black is great and the mirrors add a wonderful touch.  I don't think I can put into words how much I wanted to stay in that brass circle that we made during our warmups. My ears were being fried by the pure bliss of noise. The anticipation that came beforehand only heightened the sensory overload.    As far as our performance went, I thought we improved upon last year's performance beyond comparison. Maybe it was just me. The show didn't catch me by surprise, which could just be a result of my experience at last year's Family Day. Sure, we ran out of gas. Sure, there were tears. But in all honesty, I went out there expecting that there was going to be a train wreck, as this was the first time that we were putting everything together, in front of our friends and family, wearing the unis, and on a strange field. The train wreck never happened.... I think we're going into this next weekend of shows as a very prepared corps. The fact that we have all of our drill learned excites me. I really want to go out on Saturday, and see if we can't start the season off with a smaller gap than last year's six-pointer between us and SCVC. Which we did eventually encompass, to beat 'em anyways. Hehe.  Everything's falling into place, the stars are aligning, and the wheels are turning for BDB to have a phenomenal season. I'm glad that I'll be a part of it.
