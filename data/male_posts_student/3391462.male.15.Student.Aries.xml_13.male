I finally met someone that shares interests and common knowledge as I do about things. So fun, fun, fun. Anyways the one thing that got to me is that people are busy all the time! Like not some of the time...All of the time! Just bugs me that when you ask someone what they are doing a couple weeks from the time you ask them, they don't make other plans, they work you in! So it is eating me alittle but no pain no game. I mean there are lots of people that I would love to hang out with but they just don't have the time for me! Anyway fun in the SUN!
