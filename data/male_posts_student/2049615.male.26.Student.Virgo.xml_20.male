These two counterposed entities describe and define the available rock space and the range of possible attitudes and techniques to be adopted by all subsequent fans and practitioners of the rock form.  "The Beatles just wanted to hold your hand;  the Stones wanted to pillage your town," is one of the more popular and evocative formulations of the dichotomy.  The split is easy to see manifested in trends in rock stylism prevalent over the past ten or so years.  Today's preference for the White Stripes, the Raveonettes, Kings of Leon and so forth, with their emphasis on dirty-livin' images and more clearly blues-based melodies and song structures represents a swing of the pendulum in the Stones direction, away from Beatles-land, where it had been residing with the Flaming Lips, Neutral Milk Hotel, and the various other devotees of the Brian Wilson "me too" Sgt. Pepper Beatles cult.  This dichotomy, it will be readily understood, is total crap.  Back in the halcyon days of high school, my attendant cronies and I, dissecting the issue, came out with what we were sure was the unassailably correct answer to this entire debate:   the Who .  Well, not The Who exactly, it was more like the  idea  of the Who as prototypes of the atomsmashing punker:  strip away all that troubling  Tommy  baggage, the post-Moon output, the solo careers.   That  Who.  The "Substitute"/ Live At Leeds  Who.  Older and wiser, we now realize that the crap Who cannot be extricated from the good Who; the crapness of rock operas like  Tommy  is inescapably bound up with the aceness of rock operas like "A Quick One While He's Away".  More importantly, the Who, rather than transcending the Stones-Beatles split, merely seem to straddle it uncomfortably, spanning a gap whose construction we already accept.  This of course returns us to square one.  Knowing that this two-part rock music split is unsatisfactory, we must cast about for the third or possibly fourth elemental rock star.  Essentially, what makes the Beatles and the Stones able to function the way they do is that they exist early enough in the canonical history of Rock Music that they have no influences who are themselves part of the Rock Canon, barring (in the Beatles' case) Buddy Holly.  Elvis?  Neither of those bands sound like Elvis.  This means that while later artists can be described in terms of their relation to those two groups, there is basically no point of reference to describe them without going outside the more tightly defined sphere of rock and roll.  The same is true of their lesser contemporaries like the Hollies or the Blues Breakers.  Even a more influential contemporary like Bob Dylan cannot be understood as working as entirely within a pop-rock context as the Beatles or even the Stones (despite their blues-band origins).  While the Rolling Stones would eventually be accepted as a pop or rock group with only tenuous links to the blues idiom, Bob Dylan even today is understood by many people as a folk musician with a pop following.  The other day I was walking down the street, attempting to uncover the genius of Jeff Lynne and the Electric Light Orchestra.  You may recognize the Electric Light Orchestra from their recent hit "Go buy a Volkswagen" and "Go see the new Jim Carrey movie".  ELO have been widely and unfairly ridiculed in ages past on all sides until their recent, fully-deserved, probably Grandaddy-led revival.  ELO sit ill with most right-thinking rock fans because of their full-on Up With People mid-70s AM radio hippy-prog cathedrals of sound.  These right-thinking rock fans have clearly never heard The Free Design, who are the true avatars of full-on Up With People mid-70s AM radio hippy-prog cathedral of sound  with a jazz tinge  suckage.  The official party line is that Jeff Lynne built his entire career off of trying to emulate the production on late-model Beatles ( Let It Be ) and solo John Lennon albums and just slightly missing the mark, this being supposedly proven by his tenure in The Travelling Wilburys.  However, listening to some classic ELO ("It's A Livin' Thing", "Evil Woman", "Strange Magic", "Go buy a Volkswagen") in direct conjunction with a few other, seemingly unconnected groups (Bauhaus, Joy Division, Men's Recovery Project) threw their shared characteristics into sharp relief.  In the case of Bauhaus and Joy Division the connections are numerous and well-researched, but one aspect of their sounds in particular, characterized by a particular dryness in production and an aura of icy detachment even in the heaviest raveups ("Stigmata Martyr" and "Ice Age", respectively), is also a key component of the ELO  oeuvre .  It is only ELO's seeming stylistic distance from these groups that kept it from being properly diagnosed.  In other recordings, particularly gothic and postpunk material, this syndrome is fairly prosaic and easily-identified, being essentially a hallmark of the styles; so prosaic is it in fact that it has a name:  I am speaking of course of Bowie damage.  Clearly this is the answer to the ages-old riddle;  the third unit in the Beatles-Stones system.  Listening to such diverse groups as Gang of Four, Fugazi, Boards of Canada, the aforementioned Joy Division and Bauhaus and even total shit like Pink Floyd, which bear zero stylistic affinities to either the Stones or the Beatles, one can clearly see the stylistic traces of David Bowie fanaticism.  The Bowie myth even positions him appropriately to occupy the role:  like the Beatles and the Stones, David Bowie has no stylistic predecessors who work within a properly "rock" idiom, despite his early attempts in a less-distinctive vein and his fairly late entry into the rock icon sweepstakes (would someone tell me if that's the name of a TV show or something?).  Now that we have opened the field of paradigmatic rock acts to more than two contenders we will doubtless be flooded with many more;  there aren't any other groups that are as widely relevant, however, and so other claims will have to be dismissed:  the Velvet Underground?  Sure, I like them, and you like them, but has your kid brother even fucking  heard  of them?  the Greatful Dead?  Distinctive, yes.  Influential, yes.  Wankarama for thirty thousand hippies waving their arms around in a mud pit, yes.  Black Sabbath are probably the closest to a legitimate contender for the fourth spot, but the fame of Ozzy Osbourne, prophet of doom, as opposed to Ozzy Osbourne, klutzy dad, is still pretty much limited to people who smell like Otto's jacket.  Wow, all that and no clicky text.  Oh well, have some  urlLink zombies .
