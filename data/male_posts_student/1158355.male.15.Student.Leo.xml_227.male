We went in the pool, I talked to Matt (my cousin's boyfriend) about drums (he drums too) and how he did YYZ with his friends for the talent show...I have to do that definetly. Ok and uh...what else...oh yea I looked at the year book and watched the Yankee game. Ate some cake, was raped by my 22 year old cousin and watched him set off fireworks and then I jumped into the fireworks and dodged them and rolled like an agent...my family cheered with joy and said I should become a stunt double. That's right. Bye.
