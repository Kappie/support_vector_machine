I'm not quite through the entire album yet, but I wanted to share my thoughts on what I've heard so far (there's only a track or two left, so I feel I have a fairly good idea what the set feels like).  This is, to be honest, a wonderful collection of originals and covers.  The entire album was rehersed, recorded, and mixed in  six days  back in December 2000.  Due to record company issues, they were unable to release it until now, and it was well-worth the wait.  The performances are tight and beautiful, despite the speed with which the album was put together.  Their musicianship is mellow and understated, with melodic and subtle instrumentation.  Glen and the kids from Nickel Creek turn in great vocal performances as well, perfectly capturing the mood of these songs.  Overall, this is a very laidback album, and it captures the spirit of fun and joy evident throughout perfectly.  Stylistically, the music is very much in the Nickel Creek form, though the original songs on the album were written by Glen.  It does sound like Glen's solo work as well; almost like an acoustic version of his first solo outing.  To be honest, the style falls somewhere between the two, and it is a warm, inviting sound that simply melts into your consciousness without your hardly noticing.  All in all, I highly recommend the album to anyone who likes either Glen's solo stuff or Nickel Creek.  You won't be disappointed.  This is some of the finest Americana out there.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Mutual Admiration Society, "Sake of the World"
