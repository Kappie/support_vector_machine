Maybe because I had a little fun in it;  I linked a poem by John Agard to being similar to a song by Paul McCartney  I quoted lyrics from an REM song  In my original writing, God spoke on the PA  Weak but it got me through the whole tedious experience. Sadly I have a history exam tomorrow which is slightly harder to make your own fun in - I might try something but there isn't much room to manoeuvre with the Magna Carta.  Anyway I better be off revising for it, so I'll make like a tree [and leave/leaf]...
