My current book, "Time Stops for No Mouse," by Michael Hoeye is really good.  The plot thickened today when Hermux went in Linka Perfliger's house.  It was ransacked, but I won't say anymore.  This is a great song (see yesterday's entry).  I really need to get packing.  I think we are supposed to have some type of winter weather tonite. I really hope there is a 2 hour delay tomorrow because I don't want to go to swimming.  I just read the weather forecast and it said supposedly 4-6 inches of snow accumulation.  I really love my blog. I highly recommend them to anyone. I could just sit here forever and spill my guts through the keyboard.  Gotta motor.
