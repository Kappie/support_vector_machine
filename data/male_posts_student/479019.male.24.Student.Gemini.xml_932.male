It's sort of a confusion between desires, knowing what's best, and fear. This confusion seems to set in from time to time, until something distracts me.  Yea that was a vague ramble.  I was extremely sore at work today, and it was long and brutal . $15 in tips and a pizza bagel is not good compensation for the grueling day. The weather also wasn't bright and sunny... so me brining a change of clothes was a waste.  I get to work 12 PM to 6 PM everyday until Wednesday.... hopefully I have Thursday off for Warped.  ***
