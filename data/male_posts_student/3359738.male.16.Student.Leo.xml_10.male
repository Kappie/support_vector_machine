Today, I found a substitute, after reading on  urlLink Google cache , which is fool-proof and works a lot better, in my opinion.  It's  urlLink FastMail.fm . (Gmail is still way cooler than FastMail.fm btw.)  Anyway, you simply sign up for a fastmail.fm account, then go to the Options page, then set up your Hotmail account in the "POP/Hotmail Links" section, then go to your Mailbox page, then in the list of actions to perform, look for 'check pop links', and once you do that, it'll import all Hotmail mail on your Inbox. Once it's imported, select it all, and go in the list of actions again and look for "Redirect to people", then type in your Gmail address.  Don't forget that it only imports the Inbox, and therefore does not import any Hotmail subfolders you may have, so if you want to import all your mail, put it all in the Inbox.  Oh, and don't forget to "label" all your Hotmail mail with a "hotmail" label or something. Don't forget mail can have as many labels as you want it to have.  Good luck. ;)
