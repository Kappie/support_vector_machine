I wish I have at least two hours of gaming time, so I could change my thief into an assassin.  Last day was very boring, i'm just sitting all day long in front of tv watching scripted wrestling scenes that does'nt even qualify as "realistic" (I wonder how they avoid having bruises and bloody noses after that amount of "punishment").  My younger brother just changed his magician to a wizard last tuesday and that made me so envious... And worse, I can't even contact Zane since I ran out of load last night (ugh that was like, so darn lame).  Anyway I think that's it for now, I have yet to unravel blog's full potential (pardon the pun).
