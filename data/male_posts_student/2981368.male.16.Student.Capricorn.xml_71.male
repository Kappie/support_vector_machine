Any ideas cos i really dunno, but i doubt it was anthing to do with my girlfriend being there and me wanting to spend a bit of time with her before the easter holidays cos i sure as hell wudnt hav wanted to do that.  my my im being a subtle as a Las Vegas casino on steroids   or should i just say "as ben"  Buenos noches y adios amigos
