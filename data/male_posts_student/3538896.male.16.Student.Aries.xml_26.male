"Haiz... got some scolding today from mdm Bawani as i'm sleeping in her classes. Was so tired i jus fell asleep without knowing... but the way she scolded me, i felt care deeply from her... haiz... try not to fall asleep in her class again... today, i went to the rock world where my dad forbids mi to go again... i talked to "my other self" again... no one to listen to me, so jus talked to myself then... Haiz... problems were on friendship... but i'm okay now... especially after talking to myself... It's better than having no one to talk to... Haiz... today's chinese O level oral, i kinda go nervous and slip off on what im talkin about... photo taking on drama and then stay for awhile and went home... but thought of counting close friends of mine whom i can think of talking to... i hardly had any... or i can say i hardly had any friends along... so can forget about counting how many i can talk to... think not even 1 at the moment... haiz... dream person... im dying to meet you..." thats wad happened yesterday... for today, nothing much actually... till i realise that there isnt much time for my d and t... haiz... am i going to finish it on time?? or am i gonna jus fail my d and t?? haiz... haiz... STRESSED!!! now dilyse hated yx like crazy... so i guess... i had to make a choice eventually on choosing one on either side right?? who shall i choose... HAIZ!!!!
