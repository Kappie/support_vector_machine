And what about the time when these ideal minds are idle ? Do they end up as Satan's workshop or, more appropriately, his ( due apologies to the fairer sex ) playground ?  I don't know why these questions of all days turn up in my mind today. I feel tempted to fall for the Faustian bargain. " Mephisto shoo..... . Go away. There are children at play. " That little ditty worked like a talisman. I am free now.       So are IITians owners of ideal minds ? Well this questions poses one more problem ....  what is an ideal mind. Is it a mind with special faculties for comprehension, analysis and creativity? Or is it a mind that can appreciate the human situation, accomodate differences and participate proactively in society and contribute to it in a meaningfulway? Or is it a mind which knows how to excel in whatever it takes interest in and is adaptable enough to preserve itself and moreover grow in a hostile world? Okay I am sorry for all the fart above. I have been talking like a philosopher posing more questions than I answer. But then  isn't that life ??? Everybody has to find an answer to suit himself. There are no answers applicable to everyone. As Morpheus said... "No one can tell you what the Matrix is. You've gotta see it for yourself."
