Mother brought back chee cheong fun and after eating, I went online to play for awhile, then went out.  HaHa. I am meeting WQ and CQ today. WQ wants to buy mp3 player, so me and CQ accompanied him. Hmm. We went to eat lunch at LJS. Yeah. I have to buy for WQ again. Even CQ meowed at the silliness. Oh yes. Hmm. The counter person tried to trick us again, but I know!! YES!! I know! I didn't get tricked!   After eating lunch, we took the train towards City Hall. I am still reading Rice Bowl. Hmm. I found out I didn't really like Marie after all. She is too rebellious for my taste. Well, kinda. Yeah, too Christian too. (I know, as a Witch/Wiccan, I am not supposed to discriminate other religions. I am just uncomfortable with the story being based on Christianity...) Her plans' synopsis goes like this: "It will provide a framework for meaningful Christian involvement in the context of economic oppression in Singapore". Yes. I am very uncomfortable with that. I strongly believe in the separation of church and state (that came from Thomas Jefferson...or is it? I heard it in the MNI board). Ao meow moo!  Okay. We arrived there and while walking to Funan, was bombarded with a girl selling sme ice-cream vouchers. HaHa. I said I have no moolah, so I was left alone. In the end, WQ brought one. Wow.   Hmm. WQ went around surveying Mp3 Players. He wasn't really statisfied with the mp3s players. We soon came to Challenger. Wow!! I saw the AI game and I want it!! HaHa! I have absolutely no moolah at all, so I have to lend from KWQ the cat. Heh Heh. I owe him $18 bucks now. Meow moo meow! After that, he went to buy a Nomad MuVo (having 4GB storage) costing $400+. He actually asked the salesman the disadvantages of the MuVo player! The salesman was left in a fluster and me and CQ were laughing. Oh my god! I don't think any salesman would know the disadvantage of their product. At least must compare with another product ma! Heh Heh!  Hmm. After that, WQ suggested to go Suntec City. Okay, sure. We rushed to take the shuttle service to Suntec. Hmm. That girl stopped us again. I pointed out that she sold a ticket to WQ and she said "Oh! No wonder I found you guys so familiar!" What a silly cat. Heh Heh. Okie. We took the bus there.  Hmm. We went to Carrefour again. HaHa. Nothing much to see, so we went to shop around lor. After a while of shopping (mainly, going into a video store and looking at VCDs, or for me, looking at the current VCD playing in Cantonese), we wanted to go back home. WQ wanted to come to my house, but in the end didn't. Okay. We walked all the way to the Esplanade (nad!!! es-pla-nad, not nade! We must follow the French pronunciation! This is a French word after all!) to take the 960 bus.  I read Rice Bowl, but it got too boring for me. I wanna sleep for awhile. Heh Heh. CQ alighted at Marsiling and WQ and I alighted at the next stop. I sent him back home and I walked to Woodlands Interchange, taking 964 back.  Hmm. I went back, bathed and played my AI game. O.O! HaHaHa! What a fun game! I somehow won the game! YaY! Even the ducks sang and danced to "I Will Survive"! Heh Heh. After playing, I went to GunBound with XC, WQ and CQ for awhile, before going off to dinner.  Yeah, I went to 768 to eat fried rice, then returned home and tada, I am here. Hmmm. I think my day can be summarized as fun. Yeah. I think. Heh.   Anyhoo, Professor Sun's TTM is giving me a major headache! HaHaHa! Seriously, it is so darn difficult. I will scour the text again to get sense out of it. Hmm. Yes!! Meow meow!!  Okay. I gotta end le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
