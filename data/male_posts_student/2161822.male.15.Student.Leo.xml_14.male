Supposed to a recreation of the story of Don Quixote (I probably killed the spelling). Even though we get out of school all day, I think it will still be painful. I mean it's like a Spanish class that lasts 7 hours. Plus we have to wear our school uniforms, you know, those starchy, uncomfortable oxford shirts and sweaters. Plus after the show we get to enjoy a nice hearty, Spanish meal at McDonalds. I find it funny how most of our teachers cringed in the fact of taking a field trip for Spanish class. Chem teacher thought we were going to Wyoming street, Math teacher laughed, etc.. I think all I need to know how to say is "do you have anything to eat?" and "where is the bathroom?" I'm never going to go to Spain (well, highly unlikely) and I will probably move out of Hazleton as soon as possible, so where will Spanish be useful? Translators supposedly get the big bucks. I wouldn't become a translator if my life depended on it. Well, maybe I would. But I have trouble with the English language so I can imagine myself speaking in a different language to people of high importance about issues of high importance. Ok enough about Spanish I hear enough of it in school. I think I have found the   urlLink stupidest game online   If you are one of those people who enjoy excessivley stupid things, click the link.
