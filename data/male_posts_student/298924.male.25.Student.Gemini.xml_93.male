I was having a convo with my friend Coco (I love you buddy!!!) and she was telling me how she talked to my first crush....and she asked about me....  So here goes....a list of my 4 most significant crushes....I am pretty sure they didn't know or if they did played it really cool....the time range is 5th grade to senior year of high school....I hope they don't happen to run into this...I would be very embarrassed...but oh well...here goes nothing  Kelly S. - Man....I don't even know what it was about her in hindsight...but I had the biggest thing for her for most of my middle/high school years....we were only in class together for one year but I would run into her at various functions or at the mall and since Coco was her good friend I would keep up with what she was up to through her....well, according to Coco she has two kids now....the trippy part about it is that I know the dude who is the father, we went to middle school together....she's marrying him on Jan. 1st....I'll be there....I jokingly told Coco I would do a Dwayne Wayne....I wouldn't do something so silly....I'm happy for her....  Staci - I will never forget the first time I met her....first day of school sixth grade....she was the cutest girl I had ever seen....well we ended up being in the same class all the way through high school and she always had this Halle Berry thing going on....she was hands down the cutest girl in our class/school....she didn't like me at all when we met (I was very obnoxious....hard to believe eh?....heh heh heh)....but we ended up becoming good friends....saw her at a christmas party this past holiday season....I kinda sorta made an effort to tell her how I used to feel and then at the last minute I just sorta insinuated at it....  Inda - *sigh*I was going through my Tatyana Ali phase....I knew her most of my life but I didn't develop a crush on her until around Sophomore year of high school....she lived right up the street from me....matter of fact I caught the bus about two houses away from her....anyway for some reason she reminded me of Tatyana Ali....she was a year younger than me but she was really nice....I made   very weak   attempts to holla at her and she pretty much let me now it wasn't happening....she's doing big things where she is....so I hear....  Leslie - Okay in this case we barely knew each other....usually I can at least become friendly with a chick I find attractive....but whenever I saw this girl I would freeze up and I couldn't say a word....she was in my summer program at Xavier University of Louisiana....she was from Cali....she forever altered my perception of Cali girls....for awhile I really did wish they could all be California girls....my roommate during the program, Marcus, made a half-assed attempt to tell her that I liked her and I got sooooo mad with him....I don't know what I was scared of....I wonder what she is up to now?  So there it is....I finally got my feelings out in the open about four of the women who have caused the most inner turmoil for me....  It's funny because the whole nature of this blogging process is highly personal yet this is the first entry which really feels PERSONAL to me....like I am giving you (whoever you are) a glimpse into who I am at the very core....I'm a hopeless romantic....a big scary kid....but I feel a little better...
