Especially gay-bashing, if only because that is the one that has had a lot of debate about it recently. On  urlLink NationStates 's Forums, there are a great many debates about the whole issue or aspects of it. They're generally all very good. I don't comment in them, but I have some views on the whole thing that I think I should get down. I have nothing against Christianity  per se . Its underlying message of love and how great Jesus was/is is fine by me. What I can't stand is the Bible. True, it says being gay is bad. In Leviticus 18:22; 'Thou shalt not lie with a man as you shall with a woman. That is an abomination' (or similar, depending on which version of the Bible you are using). This is the most obvious reference. HOWEVER, Leviticus also lays down a number of other laws. Hey, have you read these? You are a sinner comparable to gays if you have eaten the fat or blood of a lamb or cow (Lev 3:17). If you're male, have you been circumcised? If so, was it on the 8th day after your birth? If you answered 'No' to either of these questions, you're a sinner (Lev 12:3). Is that a cotton and polyester shirt you're wearing? Sorry, THAT'S a sin too; no garments made of more than one fabric for you! (Lev 19:19). And have you had a haircut or a shave at all. Guess what? It's a sin (Lev 19:27). And do you observe all the holy days laid out in Leviticus 23:5 onwards? To not do so is a, guess what?; SIN! So, logically, if this Jack Chick person is wearing a cotton and polyester shirt, well, he's just as bad as gays, in his own eyes. Deary deary me. Convenient he doesn't bring this up in his little cartoon. The little Christian girl in the cartoon also says (near the bottom) 'If anyone tries to make  you  gay,  stay away  from them!'. The amount of wrong-ness in that statement is incredible. From what I've read, heard, etc., being gay is  not a choice . All gays I have talked with claim they realised they were gay, and always had been in their teens, the time when most people realise their sexuality (in a non-orientation sense). The best analogy I've ever heard of it is 'it is like being left-handed'. Sure, you can cover it up and pretend you're not your whole life, but you cannot ever change. You are in the minority, most people are different in that respect, but this is a very minor difference in an ocean of similarity. And 'make you gay'? I sympathise completely. Why, you can hardly move nowadays for people pouncing on you and attepting to brainwash you into becoming a gay. Did I say 'becoming a gay'? I meant 'becoming an Evangelical'. A little further down, little Susy says 'I feel so sad about all the kids who'll be tricked into believing its OK to be Gay (capital letter, strange) and  not  believing in Jesus.' Well, being gay (or Gay) is not exclusive of believing in Jesus. The implication is that if you are not the ultra-radical Christian Jack is, your a sinner and going to Hell. He says that non-Christians will not go to Heaven. Now this may be the case. urlLink Here  we have a little story about how the Qu'ran (not Koran) and Islam are wrong. 'Hey' says the Christian 'your religion is wrong, founded on previous religions, and is condemned by the Bible!' 'Goodness me!' exclaims the Muslim, 'so it is! I see now my entire life has been based on a lie. I will instantly renounce my religion, ignore all the parts of the Qu'ran that claim the same of Christianity, and convert!!'   My favourite exchange is this:  Muslim : 'And Jesus can't be God's son, because the [Qu'ran] declares 'SAY NOT ALLAH BEGOT A SON'.  Christian : 'That's no problem sir, becuase Allah is NOT God.'  The next part can be summed up as:   Muslim : 'I see you're right! I'll gladly take your religion's word over mine's!' Strewth. If this Muslim is so confident about his religion (as in panel 3), why does he renounce it after the shortest of speeches from a Christian? I'm atheist, and surely with no prior allegiance I should be easier to convert, but it'd take a lot more than 'look what the Bible says' to convince me, given the amount of crap in it. (See above) I don't want you to get me wrong, I am not pro-Islam or anti-Christianity, I try to be impartial to religions, it's just that the people who tout them seem to be, nearly without exception, idiots.  I mean, look at  urlLink this . It reveals that those nations who do not support Isreal are cursed by God. It is becuase of this curse the British Empire collapsed (well, all those other therories are out the window), why many African countries are suffering drought and famine (but Somalia is in a civil war, and they never did anything to Isreal), why Russia is in 'the mess it is today' (seems fine to me, after it renounced Communism) and America is merely 'a puppet of the UN' (and we can clearly see that in the way the UN instantly stopped all plans for the USA to invade Iraq.). Further idiocy can be found  urlLink here , where a 12-year-old demolishes evolution. It's a shame that his teacher is such a moron that he cannot provide other examples of man's evolution from apes, doesn't bring up the theories behind carbon-dating, doesn't mention that trees could have fallen into cracks, BE millions of years old, bring up bone structure in animals, Darwin's Theory of Evolution Through Natural Selection, or show that most 'Deep Physics' is based on theory, and there may be a better one than 'gluons'. If Heaven is populated with the likes of Jack, then God can't be that great. An incredible array of stupid cartoons will be added as I find them: 1.  urlLink Dungeons and Dragons = Witchcraft  2.  urlLink God can kill you for ignorance.  Shame. Think of all those Christians who don't know about the Cotton and Polyester Shirt Sin. 3.  urlLink Being a good person is no match for being an adequete one who believes in Jesus . 4.  urlLink A fanatical Muslim has the joke on him when he gets sent to Hell! Hahaha!!    5.  urlLink Judaism is wrong.  6.  urlLink Looks like evolution is pretty easy to debunk. No mention of carbon-dating...  7.  urlLink How to defeat your kidnappers by teaching them about Christ.  8.  urlLink Witches, blah.  Well, this is a particularly stupid one. 'Witches will go to Hell!'. Yeah, well, everyone goes to Hell, so what's new? (Seems a little unfair that everyone gets the same punishment. And why did God create Hell in the first place? And why did He make man imperfect? And why hasn't He stop Satan? And why does He allow suffering? Can you remember what I was saying before I opened these brackets?) But this is stupid, as I said. How can you on the one hand say 'All other religions are false', and on the other 'Witchcraft works'? ('Something powerful is blocking my spell' implies that there is a spell to block.) And it has the old 'anything new is Satan' line. In this, it's Harry Potter, the speccy embodiment of Beelezbub on Earth, of course. Goodness me (Well, you try not using the Lord's name in vain), I wonder how many Christians have been turned to Satan by J.K Rowling's evil creation? I'd say none. Only Christians count, as the others were going to go to Hell anyway. Of course, 'witches' are equally stupid, if not more so. Most religions are silly, Wicca is sillier than most. Up yours, Jack.
