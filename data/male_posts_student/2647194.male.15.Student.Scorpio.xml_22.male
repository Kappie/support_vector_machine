This week has been tough so far-I've been sleep deprived, feeling like crap, overworked with stuff, and no block days with study halls. Damned 8th graders... So, this week's Thursday and Friday have been straight up 6 period days.  Warning: Never slack off in pre-calculus. You'll regret it.  Random thought: Studies show that glasses may improve your IQ by at least 5%. Not really...lol, but they do make you feel smarter.  Random Spanish Funny:  When asked what the imperfect progressive conjugation of the verb "pagar" is, Matt follows by answering with several different variations of the conjugations, "vaginando" and "pagina". That was again coupled with another round of "the penis game". This oddly enough sounds somewhat like something Jimmy Fallon would say during Weekend Update.  As for English, To Kill a Mockingbird is getting even better. The trial has started, so that's going to pick things up a bit. Biology was even better...lol: As the video People of the Forest got going, Matt, Sam, Pat, and Anton played the penis game, only they replaced "penis", with "Saali's hot". Needless to say, it got her furious, which as we all know, is mucho comico. Things got worse though when they did that to me. Then Pat started hitting on me...blegh. Pat'll never get Kacy-no matter how much or hard he strokes her hair.  To follow the pattern of weekend skiing, I may go again this weekend. However, the following week I will be skiing like hell up at Lutsen Mountains and Spirit Mountain up north-what fun.  I take it you've had enough of my talking for one night, so I'll just go into that corner over there...Actually, I'm not going back into the corner. I've got some social reading and math to do, so I gotta scram.  Thank you to everyone who has given me things to ramble on about...hehe.
