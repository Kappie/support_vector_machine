The result of which saw me home from work early.   To the chap that spit at: FUCK YOU, you chickenshit asshole. Gave you the opportunity to take a swing, you just couldn't find the balls to do it. You can leave this situation knowing that you simply couldn't handle a situation with a kid half your age and size. Wimp.  That's all for now.
