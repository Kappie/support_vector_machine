(I know, I know it is early for St. Patrick’s Day, but it was in my dream.)  So as I was tellin’ ya Riley has these peircin’ green emerald eyes, and ye know what I love ‘im for ‘em.  So, ya’!  In this her’ dream I had, Riley was conversing wit’ this thick Irish accent.  God, he was so fuckin’ cute, although not as cute as he is in real life.  And I was a stupid arse fool.  An’ some o’ the conversation was:    Disco: “Do they have Irish Spring soap in Ireland?” Fabi:  “O’ course not.  That stuff smells like cheap purfume, what ye think stand around cuttin’ up perfectly good bars of soap?” Disco:  “So why ye arses be kicked so bad by da’ English?” (Trying to sound Irish) Fabi:  “I reckon the same reason Poland fell like a house of cards to the Nazis.” Disco:  “So, I need to know, are you after me Lucky Charms, Mister Hays?  Do ye think I be magically delicious?” (Grinning) Fabi:  “You’ve not only some charm, ye have um all and I bet some are lucky, me boy.” (Walking closer to Disco) Well, I assume that ye all can finish off the thought processes inside of me mind…     The snow and ice are old, covered in rottiong layers of salt and sand and dog shit and garbage.  March is the ugliest month in this frickin’ state, the trees are bare, and the ground a dirty mess from freezing, then thawing, then again freezing.  Sure most of it is over, the sun shines brighter and longer every passing day but winter hangs on like a son of a bitch.  Even more so and tighter then a drowning man trying to pull you under with him.     Ah, again with the writing!  Bitch, you need to stop.  Fuck you nigga'!  I got some inspiration!   Oh, May the years be long May our hearts be strong May they never break nor bow May they never experience woe May I make you happy as you do me May we spend together forever and always be And, may things not get so rough May we know love alone is enough May I glance over and you be there May forever we know we do care May I always make you happy like you do to me May I always and forever be with thee And, may we love each other forever and ever May I never lose you, not now, not never May this be for all that transpires May this be for eternity, till life expires May I make you happy as you do me May we spend forever in each other’s arms and be   This is for those 1001 wishes And the 2000 more to come  This is for those great evenings  And everything that shall come This is for those nights passed together And those drifting-offs that will come This is for our laughter  And the riddle that will come This is for the salty, tears And to the hand that wipes them away But mostly this is for love And our futures together like a new day
