Imagine Reverand Al in prime time.  Is it fair to judge Kerry by the company he keeps?  He speaks of Sharpton in words that imply respect.  What do you guys really know about Sharpton?  Here's a clip from Boortz about Sharpton's past.  Maybe Sharpton can use this speech to apologize to Steve Pagones.  Sharpton accused Pagones, a prosecutor, of raping Tawana Brawley.  Pagones later sued Sharpton and was awarded $345,000.  Sharpton has yet to apologize for his role in the Brawley affair, and his unfounded and slanderous accusations against Pagones and others.  While Sharpton's on a roll, maybe he can apologize to the family of Yankel Rosenbaum.  Rosenbaum was surrounded and stabbed to death by a Brooklyn mob shouting "kill the Jews." The crowd had been whipped into a frenzy by Al Sharpton railing against "diamond merchants" with "the blood of innocent babies" on their hands.  What was this all about?  A young black child was killed in a traffic accident.  A Jew was driving the car that killed him.  Sharpton can finish by apologizing to the families of the seven employees of Freddy's Fashion Mart in Harlem.  Freddy's, you see, was owned by a white Jew.  The owner of Freddy's rents his space from a black landlord.  He then rents a small portion of his space to a music store owned by a black man.  The black landlord raises the rent on Freddy's Fashion Mart.  This means that the owner of Freddy's, the white Jew, must raise the rent on the black man who owns the record store.  Enter Al Sharpton.  Sharpton starts leading demonstrations.  He screams to the crowd that "We will not stand by and allow them to move this brother so that some white interloper can expand his business."  Sharpton's mob starts yelling "Burn down the Jew store!" and "We're going to see that this cracker suffers."  A protester enters the store.  He warns all black customers to get out and then shoots four employees point-blank, then sets a fire.  Seven employees dead.  Sharpton owes them an apology.   End quote.  What does this say about Kerry, and the party as a whole?  What does this do to your sense of neutrality, Steve?  Is this a fair set of questions?
