I completed Disc 2! Whoo-hoo! I got Armarant in my team, saw the cut-offed FMVs (which I am downloading for my viewing pleasure), the death of Brahne... Yeah. Disc 2 completed. Moving on to Disc 3!!   Okay. I originally planned to discuss about the WQ issue today, but due to time constraints and serious headaches, I decided to push it to tomorrow.   So therefore, I am blogging off now. Yes yes, I know. A very short and dissappointing blog. But remember, I am having a major headache. So there. Bye blog! Night!
