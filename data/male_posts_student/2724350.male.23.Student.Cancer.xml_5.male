Over these few months, several events had occured to slowly but definitely change the way I think and eventually behave.  One of these things is having met my ex-clinical educator, whose name whom I shall not disclose to avoid any trouble. During this short period of time I was with him, he not only taught me the basic essential knowledge to become a better clinician. He did what I felt few clinical educators could. He lit up my fire of passion for the profession. "Endless" discussions of the profession had left their marks in my gullible brain. The result of that attachment was a friendship forged between a mentor and his student. I am extremely grateful for having being under his tutelage because he not only taught me how to be a better clinician but also a better person.  I remember having heard a saying(probably from one of those drama serials) that it is worth waiting ten years of solitude to meet with a worthy teacher. This is especially true for me. Every word that literally comes out from his mouth becomes a memory etched in my subconcious. You may wonder why I am offering praises for someone whom I have just met. Deep down in my heart, I have this feeling that he is the one whom I have waited over the years to confide in. I believe that everyone has someone whom he or she calls "sensei" or master, who will guide the student to their goals. With that, I shall leave you with a quote from Confucius my mentor told me:   "Knowing one's limitations or incompetence is also a form of knowledge. The knowledge that leads to the improvement of oneself."
