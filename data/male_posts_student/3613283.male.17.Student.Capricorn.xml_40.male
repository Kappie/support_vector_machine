Thoughts  I was delighted to see Saddam in court, althought I was a bit pissed off by his rhetoric, it really is a very important symbol to the Iraqi people, that's for sure.  On the Iraq handover, I'm surprised that the terrorist attacks haven't  really  increased, and the situation isn't getting out of hand which is a good point for the new Iraqi interim government. I'd like everyone to remember, as I've already said, in 5, 10, 15 years that sooo many people were extremely critical and I hope that these guys  (i.e. Jacques Chirac)  will not dare say how great 2010 Iraq is.  Now I'm off partying :)
