I want to see her Yawn, suck her thumb, and strech after waking up.  Thats going to be soooooooooo cute!!! Now when she moves my whole stomach goes side ways, left to rite.  Its like my baby is teasing me..."ha ha you cant see me..suffer mom suffer!!!"  One more reason I want her out is so I can get sleeeep..not easy sleeping at night because I move around alot during sleep.  Now when I turn I have to shift MY WHOLE stomach and wait for the baby to drop the other side...hehehe.  I guess these last two months is going to be the hardest, but once the baby is born its not like I am going to get sleep anyways.  So I should or everyone in our house should enjoy the quietness around the house.    I think Dharmesh is getting eager now as well to see the baby....pappa gotta suffer as well as mom.  Mommy Dearest !!
