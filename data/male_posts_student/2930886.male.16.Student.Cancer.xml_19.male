Today was really damn hot. I mean I couldnt find any shorts this morning that were clean and I went through the day in long pants. English wasnt that bad except for Charles I mean now really he over reacts a lot, he almost acts like a girl and that annoys me a a little. Business law is annoying because we are doing these dumb worksheets which we will use for an open notebook test next Monday. Study hall was boring but I was only defeated in tic tac toe  time out of about 25 times. US History was hot as hell, the period was long and boring and apparently Miss Brooks was wrong on the 3rd reich, not The Holy Roman Empire and Napolean, but the 2 previoous rulers of Germany. Chemistry was easy because we had an open notebook test which I got a hundred on according to Jesse. French was really hot and i broke a sweat just sitting there. I did a translation and some questions. Then to Algebra two where I did a quiz and some work on worksheets and there was a sub not the teacher. And yeah it was really hot. I will update more tonight.
