It's a very bad movie, possibly the worst movie I've ever watched.   I never thought I'd say that about a movie starring Schwarzenegger. Probably that's because  Red Sonja  isn't actually a Schwarzenegger movie; it's a movie that happens to have him in it. The actual star is a woman who is both horrible at acting and doesn't have Schwarzenegger's moviegenic personality.   Here's the movie's plot: priesthood of women guards green orb that can destroy the world somehow, and prepares to destroy it. An evil queen kills all the woman-priests except for one, Sonja's sister. Sonja's sister meets Schwarzenegger who takes her to Sonja. Sonja goes off on quest to blow up the orb, sister dies, Schwarzenegger follows stealthily. Along the way they meet the boy prince of a kingdom destroyed by the evil queen with the orb. They travel together on a quest to kill the evil queen and blow up the orb. Guess who wins.  Okay, so Schwarzenegger movies aren't known for plot, or even special effects (which were seriously wanting in this movie). Fine. But in this movie even the fight scenes were bad; the scenes that had Schwarznegger were pretty good, but everything else was horrible. In most Schwarzenegger movies this isn't a big deal because he's in all of the fight scenes, but in this movie this was a problem because half the time it was Sonja who actually did the fighting.   In conclusion, you shouldn't watch  Red Sonja . You should watch any other movie by Schwarzenegger, though, except possibly  Last Action Hero , which I hear was bad but haven't seen yet.   Actually, now that I think about it, the only violent movies I like are about guns and karate; I don't like sword movies much. That's another reason why  Red Sonja  is a bad movie--it's a sword movie.
