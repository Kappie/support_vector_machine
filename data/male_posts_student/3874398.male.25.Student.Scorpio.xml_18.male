I kept hearing the same refrain from players and "importants" alike: "We don't want to upset the balance."  Marching to the beat of "If it ain't broke don't fix it," the Cardinals silently went through July 31--confidently.  We will see if this will be another year of the "sins of the past."   Most important transactions:(in order of importance)  A. Cardinals staying put  B.  Nomar-Cubs think they can make a run at the post-season by improving a glaring weakness.  Once they get there, they are relying on pitching getting healthier.  This trade should worry the most confident of Cardinal fans.  C.  Loaiza-Yankees gain a VERY quality starter to an already stellar rotation.  At what point will the Bombers stop spending $$?  Does Steinbrenner have a limit?  How much CAN he spend?  Shouldn't teams at some point wisen up and stop selling their "pennant-souls" to the AL NYers?  -CJ
