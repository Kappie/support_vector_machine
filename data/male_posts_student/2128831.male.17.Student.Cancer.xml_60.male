The thought of a pure, utopian society has faded while MHS has captured the last breath of any rational existence and conquered our self-worth. In coming days it is likely to see a plethora of unpleasant faces staring into an oblivion that can only be experienced by the MHS society. The underlying prolificacy in which this institution so loves to put forth has taken a toll on our already feeble carcasses, in result of consuming repulsive cafeteria rations. The possibility of survival is a distant notion...God help us all..." It seems like everywhere I go I’m REALLY cold. It would be so nice to lie with someone in a really comfy bed under the blankets and just lie there, and be really warm. I’m not saying that in a sexual way because I’m "horny," I’m saying that in a completely innocent love kinda way. (Believe it!) ah, that would be so nice :) MER!  You can take all this bullshit and stick it where the Sun don’t shine. I'm a little sick of hearing all this shit about my work and my ethics when God only knows how many times I've had to take control because you were too fucking stupid to handle a line. I work my ass off for you and this goddamn place, and all I get in return is another set of duties and a transfer ripped away because you, sir, can't deal with what you are! Do you fucking know what I've given up for you?  Sorry, had to get that out after the past couple days. I seriously have decided to quit, though. Not my job. I'm not decided on that. I've decided to really quit caring. It came over me this morning when I was lying in bed staring at the pictures hanging on my wall. What's the point of caring anymore? Honestly, it seems that every time I give a shit, I end up getting stuck in this little hole where I can't move, breathe or think straight. So, I went backwards a bit. Lemme explain… I am a cold bastard. It wasn't because of anything more than I'd been hurt, and I didn't want to be hurt again, cause my ways of dealing with pain normally end up with me destroying myself. I wasn't happier. I was downright miserable. But not letting people get close insured that people couldn't hurt me. I've been hurt a lot in my life. I'm a little sick of it. How can I avoid it from now on? Easy. I'm going to be that shithead again. The one who really just doesn't like people? I can laugh, I can talk, and I can have a good time, but I can't care about people anymore. I know how it ends. I'm sick of running that gauntlet every time someone comes into my life. I'm not going to try to shut anyone out. There's no point behind it, cause I can't. But I was looking in the mirror this morning and I realized that Will was right. I'm not me anymore. I've shut down and gone dead.  I used to say I wouldn't let this thing with John change me, cause I'd rather believe in love and give it away to the people I care about. I still believe in love. I don't believe in people anymore. We're too flawed to ever truly care about people. I think all my past shows I need me time.  I am jus’ annoyed give me a couple days. But to you bye!  He put him out like the burning end of a midnight cigarette. He broke his heart: He spent his whole life trying to forget. We watched him drink his pain away, a little at a time, But he never could get drunk enough to get him off his mind, Until the night: He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger. And finally drank away his memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger, Than the strength he had to get up off his knees. We found him with his face down in the pillow, With a note that said: "I'll love him till I die." And when we buried him beneath the willow, The angels sang a whiskey lullabye. The room was full but nobody knew how much he blamed herself. 			        For years and years, he tried to hide the whiskey on his breath. He finally drank her pain away, a little at a time, But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind. Until the night: She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger. And finally drank away his memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger, Than the strength she had to get up off her knees. We found her with her face down in the pillow, Clinging to his picture for dear life. We laid her next to him beneath the willow, While the angels sang a whiskey lullabye.
