My water glass is almost empty, my phone is not ringing, and I've already played more than my fair share of Yeti Sports games for the evening.   I had a mind to write this wonderfully insightful post about my personality. Yeah, that didn't so much work out. It would have been great...immortalizing my flaws and strengths, my quirks and cutenesses (that is so not a word, but I don't care), and generally ending up sounding like some desperate guy trying to write a clever singles ad, and trying not to sound desperate.   So I came down to the kitchen today and encountered my To Do List, which was scrawled on the dry erase board that has been magnetically attached to the fridge since Robb moved in. I don't mind...in truth, I always wanted one of those thingies on my fridge, but never had the sense to buy one. Well, I accomplished three of my five goals (I think there were five, anyway), and managed to be academically productive too. Wow, what a day. I had to get out of the house later though, because I'd been cooped up inside all day long. Man, did I watch a lot of Angel. But I finished my testing for my assessment class too, and now all I have to do is...write...the...reports...(stifling a tearful wail)  What the hell am I writing about right now?  Wait wait...the clock is reading "2:56 Now Go The Crap To Sleep AM" Is that a signal? Oh wait, I've got more!  I went walking tonight at like 1:30 AM...okay, so technically that's this morning. I went down to the track, and walked a lap around the field. Man, the stars were everywhere...ah, the stars. Jesus, I'm done now. Seriously. Go to sleep.
