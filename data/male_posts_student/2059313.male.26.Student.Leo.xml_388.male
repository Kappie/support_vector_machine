I have wanted to change my template for a while now, and prior to the unfortunate state of my laptop, I was working on one.  Now, I've switched back to one of the lame template presets that you can get from blogger (they're nice and all, but I'm just not content with them anymore) until I can upload my new page.  I just got tired of looking at the other one, really.  On another note, I leave for Prestonsburg, KY, in 5 days.  Podunkville, USA, as I affectionately call it sometimes.  It's a really beautiful place, but I miss everything about a larger city when I'm gone.  The blog will probably be put on haitus (sp?) for a couple months since I may not have access to the internet.  I know all three of you who read my blog will be distraught and heart-broken (yeah, right) but it can't be avoided.  Please pray for patience, sanity, health, and safety for me while I'm away.  Thanks. :)
