Last night I got home from a party and stayed up all night on msn!! It was a great laugh, i spoke too people like Wacky and Marissa :p hehe!!    Today, I just basically went too Bourton on the Water, and we went and had a meal then went to 'Birdland', i had an interesting paddle in the river! It was brilliant, in birdland, i actually started screaming like a monkey at some parrots, they seemed too enjoy it!! Then further around, i saw a cockatoo that was on its own in the cage, and was trying too get attention by nodding up and down, but it sounded really lonely, so we stroked it!! Then of course, we had the interesting journey home! With my impressions and things! This brings me too here, where I am on the PC doing my blog (mr. hypocritical).     I'm off for now, I'll write here tomorrow!
