In reference to the revolt against Marten -I'm with Marten on this one.  He's the one who invited us onto this blog, so it's still officially his.  He made it, so if he doesn't like what you're posting then you need to make another blog for those posts.  Talk about interesting stuff.  Like how hot I am.  :-) Anyways, I got all my money stolen today.  I think it happened before 3rd block.  I'm so sad, that was all the money I'd saved up...$49.  lol, that's not even two allowances...so I just need to wait 2 weeks and I'll have more money than that, but, you know, it's the idea.  Someone stole from me.  That's so sad.  Sorry...I'm traumatized. Anyways (again) Pre-show is fun.  Marten, when is the fall play?  lol...isn't it November 6, 7, and 8?  Cuz I want to invite people to see my StArRiNg RoLe...lol...not...but I don't know when to tell them to come!   Anyways (I need to stop saying that) SO EXCITED ABOUT THURSDAY!!!! SQUEE!
