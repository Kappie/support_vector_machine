James design doesnt suit the site enough ok i can see youve spent alot of time at it but you dont want the navigation to stand out and using flash makes things stand out, plus the currentnavigation is better, itsa bit smaller and in your oneclicking for the navigatin to appear isnt very proffessional, i like it the way it is small, simple, easily fixed and quick to download      Beckett   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
