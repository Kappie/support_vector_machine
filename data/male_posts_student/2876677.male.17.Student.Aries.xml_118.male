This is fun" feeling to wear off but not long enough to subconciously associate myself with Staples.  In other news, due to circumstances out of my control(an authority over me has done something) I am totally out of the Lord's will.  Sorta.  I know that I am to obey authority "in the Lord" but I do not think they made the right choice and I really cant do anything without the authority's help.  So I am stuck, feeling awful about not being where I am supposed to be, praying the authority will see what I am saying, and trying to make the best of what I have right now.  So if you wanted to pray for me I would appreciate it.  In other news, this is the closest I have ever been to turning in a research paper...I finished it at 5:00 yesterday...It was due at 12:30...c'est la vie.  at least I am working the time down.  In 6th grade, I turned one in three months late. My parents wouldnt even let me open Christmas presents until like February.  It was a time.  Well my pizza is ready. *leaves*
