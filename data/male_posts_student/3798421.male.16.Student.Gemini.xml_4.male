Considering I have never been in a relationship that has progressed as far as that, I think I should be the first person desperate to get into a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. Tonight, I have realized once again that they are not worth it. While I should be sleeping at this moment in time, I am actually waiting up for Andrea to get back online. I actually highly doubt she will. Even if she does, my logic still holds. Ready for the top reasons why such relationships are not worth a wooden nickel?  1. They take time and effort that could easily be used for productive things (like sleep).  2. They also take money.  3. All you get is some physical and mental comfort for a short period(s) of time.  4. Three words: Sexually Transmitted Diseases. And even if you don't get that far, you have those kissing diseases.  5. Because they are selfish (one on one relationship), friendships with other people you know deteriorate because you are spending time with the "special person".  6. Because easily the hard times offset the fun times. Look at how half of the love songs on the radio are about broken love, love lost, etc.  7. You get joked about by your family, and friends.  8. In the end you get heartbroken and walletbroken. Broke.  9. In a one in a hundred case, you marry a person, and the mairrage has a fifty percent chance of failing anyway. And if it doesn't, you are stuck with the same person who gets on your nerves. Example: look at your parents.  And finally, 10 is the ONLY  REAL  REASON why it is good to have a romantic relationship.  10. Because you swap germs when you kiss, it strenghtens your immune system.  As you can see, it's true. Such relationships are logically not worth it. So, why do so many people want to get into them? Beats me. Actually, I have felt the feelings that everyone else has felt, I know why people date other people. It is just hard to put a finger on, and so to put out that feeling I have created that list. Now that it all makes sense, I can sleep better. Ha, Cupid, take THAT!
