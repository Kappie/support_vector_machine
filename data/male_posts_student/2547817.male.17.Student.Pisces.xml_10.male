However, economics on the other hand isn't as appealing to me. The definitions are so rigid, I could throw freaking boulders through the holes in the stupid thing. I mean really, urgh, I'm tired of a lot of things. I think I'm loosing my writers edge. Maybe, I just don't have the time to write anything solid. I promise a good one soon ok?  It'll be on inferiority complexes. Yap, you reading this man? ahahaha! Shitz lorzxz! I soundz like bengz lorx~  Alright, I am overly taxed, if you hadn't guessed by now it's fine, I'm not sure if I'm making sense anymore. Fingers tired, eyes LITERALLY closing. Need shut down... head nodding off. Really, I noo shita youa.  Good Byexzxzxzxz
