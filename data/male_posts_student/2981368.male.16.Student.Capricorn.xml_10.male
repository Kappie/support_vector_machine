V. boring and craptastic day ( Wow, a blue car! ) as in, daytime TV, dog walks and watching last weeks hockey again. And the rugby (ha-ha Wales, England rules).  Found a song that pretty much sums up Nat, lol. (No, not in  that  way). And half the lyrics sound EXACTLY like things she's said...scary. Song is "Needs" by Collective Soul. You'll see what I mean by the end of the first verse. Meh.  Hopefully there'll be more woot-tastic stuff happenin tomorrow. But probably not *bah homework*
