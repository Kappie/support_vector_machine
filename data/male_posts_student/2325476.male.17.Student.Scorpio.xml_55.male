That and I need to finally be out and on my own. I'm too much of a recluse for parents and/or family. That's why I'm not appealing to ppl. I'm a fucking hermit, lol.   Yodobunun mashigeh sengyutda, bitches!!! (no idea of how to "properly" translate korean characters to english letters, so that my best phoenetic approximation)
