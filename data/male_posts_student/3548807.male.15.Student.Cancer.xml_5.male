This entire night i was planning on doing it!...but no...what does sam do? he pussies out! there were a couple times though when we just looked at eachother and we knew exactly what eachother was thinking. the worst part though was when we were ALONE! i still couldn't do it...although there were some sorta samples of what could've been said...but still. when i had to leave i had my bag o prezzies in my hand, and i was about to walk up the stair...and i froze...i was so close to saying it. I even started to laugh about it a couple of times. but still..FAAACK! leading up to tonight was just so strange because i was so sure that i could do it. but when it came to us being alone which is how i waited for it to be, i still couldn't do it. wtf mate? so now i'm sad...i'm going to go and sob. Sam
