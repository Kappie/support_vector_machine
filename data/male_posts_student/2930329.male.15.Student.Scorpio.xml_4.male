Starting off ill get a job and make my own cash and not have to beg for, 2 im Joining soccer (again), and ill also start out some sort of workout routine that will get me somewhere, and if im gonna join the soccer team ive obviosly got to start running every Morning... early, before sunrise, lets say A mile and then im moving into our new house a 1/2 mile away from the state park,(ill still goto the same school) and next door to the public pool. being a life guard would be to cool, the house is 5 bed, 3 bath, which is a miracle! My own room? but i have yet to wait another month, we move in July 3 which is not the best idea, 4th of July and New House Move In? no, not a good idea... Goodnight
