Yippee!  only like...175 days left...then 360 more and i'm done forever, always assuming I don't drop out...that's not extremely likely though.  Feelin'  uninspired...think I'll start a fire.  I desperately need to write SOMETHING.  I don't know...song, poem, book, story, whatever.  I'll do that and THEN start that fire.     I got some tricking inspiration by watching Jujimufu in his latest video, and watching the aerial tutorial.  I still don't have the guts to try an aerial so I just did some cartwheels and seeing how I can't even do a one handed cartwheel I need practice.   If you didn't notice I really had and still have nothing to write about...I'm in a kinda weird mood today.  I think I'll go out in the woods or down some trails or something...maybe draw some...write somethin.  Later.
