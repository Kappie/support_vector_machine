HaHa. CQ's a newbie too. Oh well. I haven't been playing for so long! After that, someone mysteriously messaged me. It's one of YingYing's friend, asking me for help on locus. Yeah, so helped him a bit lor. After that, I played my Sims. Woah! Long time never play that le. After finishing, I went online la.  At 6 something, I went to eat dinner. Today, Mother cooked, due to my special request. I don't wanna buy food outside again la. Eat eat eat, watched some tV then went to bath.  Hmm. Chun just called. She wanted to find out Metro's number. It looks like she wanna go interview for sales associate too. I asked if she wanna go together. She agreed lor. We are meeting after she called me tomorrow. She's calling HQ first, to find out if there are vacancies (sure got one la...). If there's only one place, may the best person win then (got more than one de la. The receptionist told me there's some, and I don't think anyone went to interview on Friday lor. Weekends no interviews). It would be cool though, me and Chun going into Metro together. HeHe. I also cut my fingernails (surpirse surprise! I am not an advocate of nail-cutting, as you all know). Good impression counts, and good impression includes neatness. Yeah.  Well, yeah. So ends my blog for today. See ya tomorrow with news! Good luck to me!! Night blog!
