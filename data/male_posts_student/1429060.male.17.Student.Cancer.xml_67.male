I shan't excuse myself by saying that I have been busy, buried in schoolwork, etc. I shall simply offer this explanation: I have been lazy as hell and had nothing to publish. So there. Nee!  School's fine, homework's fine, piano's not to fine but getting there, my friends are fine, why the bloody heck is this sounding like a summer camp note, I ate dinner at an English pub recently, my brother has a friend over who harasses me, I practically died this morning trying to awaken for the PSAT workshop, the cat is attacking my stocking feet to gain attention, the psychiatrist has the power to send me into a mental institute, I am avoiding about five different long-term projects right now, my heart skips for some reason, there is an army of plague-spreading skeletons from the reign of King Arthur rising from the kitchen sink (how did they get to Tennessee?), and I am arguing with the voices in my head. All in all, a fairly balanced existence. *cough cough BS*  I had a lovely afternoon today, but I feel bad, because I left someone that I should have stayed with. And I shan't state names, lest that the person of whom I speak is angered at me, or lest people begin to ask too many questions. But I wrote of it:   Iced Tea  There’s a knocking at the door that I hid beneath my flesh Barely visible, right over my heart Only to be opened for a few And then, only a crack The door’s ajar; there’s a gale outside And I close it tightly shut again, But you were able to reach in Staying my hand And your blood’s warmth Flowed from your palm to my fingers I’ve been keeping the thermostat down low Maybe I like the cold Maybe I feared the warmth for a time So my hand began to hurt with the New circulation And my heart began to pump, I’ve been having dreams lately We were in the back of a movie theater I won’t say exactly what we did But it gave me the same sort of euphoria That made my mind flutter And my breath come short When you leaned against my chest, I kissed below your left eye Forgotten something now… I didn’t take you to the stars Would have, if I didn’t fear myself Your friends are all so nice, so… … Above me… And I can’t stand in a crowd for long My lungs choke up And I fall into some cardiac arrest That happened when I was driving (I didn’t tell anyone) Come in, have some tea Before it freezes in my hand.   Orlando Bloom is an elf and a demi-god. Say nothing of him! Bwahaha. Sorry. Have a lovely evening, mortals.
