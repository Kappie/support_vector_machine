I for once determined I'm never going out again if there isn't a girl included in some part of the equation. I couldn't stop feeling like shit, out of place, and not wanting to be there last night. I still can't figure out what they like of spending time like that, I would've rather stay at home, so next time I will. I'm just glad that all of this will be over soon. I can't help feeling like a looser every time I do this so it's not happening again.    Figuring out why Laurita bailed on my at the last minute is not easy but knowing that she's kinda nuts helps me not feel like all that rejected, though you can never lose the whole feeling. I doesn't make sense if you take into account that she was the one that originally asked me out, but I'll ask her what went on. In any case at least I won't be seeing her again in a while.
