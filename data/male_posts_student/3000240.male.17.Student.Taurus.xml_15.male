I think also I'm gathering some decent work ethic. I've almost done my coursework for maths and I'm beginning to work quite hard in the three as-levels I'm taking, well all be it not at home and only in the college library, but hey it's a start at least, and is ten times better than what I could have managed say a month ago. Well have a good weekend whoever you are, I'm of to do some psychology - whoooo me I'm working.  xBuBzx
