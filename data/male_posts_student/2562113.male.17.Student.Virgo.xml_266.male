Friday: me, kev, jeff, and erek went to student life to get information on starting Sigma MU Theta. She gave us papers and pretty much interrogated us about it. we didn't have the book. i think it's somewhere in my mess of a house. to start a local frat we need insurance.. costing thousands of dollars out of our pockets. to be a chapter of a national frat and go with their insurance all we gotta do is pledge and we can start our own. jeff did some work and we need 23 more ppl to pledge with us next semester for Pi Kappa Phi. once that's done we have Sigma MU Theta. there's a lot of other details and it's going to be a fucking pain is the ass, but it will be worth it.. way worth it fellas. That night i funneled beer for the first time. it was great. we chilled at 21.. we tried to order $100 in wings, but someone sent a woman to do a man's job and we didn't get our wings. i was hungry, so hungry. ericka was so nice and hooked me up with some food  : )  we passed out shortly after eating and the next morning sheryl told me she took pictures of us sleeping at like 3am. wtf.  crazy ass girls.  Saturday: slept off my hangover and showered and got brunch. i read a book outside and passed out on the bench. there was chinese food in the campus center, it had devastating effects on me and derek. at night i funneled 6 beers and went out to Sneaky's with everyone. it was fucking amazing. louie devito, a popular techno guy, was the dj. i danced till i was drenched. it was the first time i did glow sticks and i think i did alright. this dude came up to me and gave me a VIP pass for raving. we left shortly thereafter because everyone was leaving at it was 3am. i showered when i got back and jac slept over. i said my byes to her this morning.. she's not going back to st. rose  : (  Today was boring as fuck. the internet has been down all day. my whole body is sore. I have 30 beers sitting in my fridge. I can't put them to use until Friday night.. I have a final Friday morning  : (   only 3 days of classes left and then 4 finals and then Iâ€™m done. See yall Friday may 14 morning for six flags!!  - R w L super SMUT
