It was kind of fun... but my mind still haven't changed about quitting FFXI. Yup, that's not a mistake... I am quitting FFXI. I still going to keep my account, this is not a permanent thing I just need a break for a while.    Yesterday we went to Jacksonville, FL shopping and eating. Their mall is quite large and have a fair amount of good stores in it. We also went to CompUSA and I bought a wrist rest sponge thingy and a  urlLink  Antec LANPAL: Ultimate PC Case Carrying System  . This carrying system is nice, now I am able to hand carry my computer or just use the strip around my shoulder and carry it. Not bad for only $16.00. Now only I can find a way to change out my ugly black Dell case.... -_-
