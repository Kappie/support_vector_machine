Today started out at about 11:30 for Tyke.  He meandered around the house until he found what he liked.  PS2.  He played that for a while while talking online just a tidbit.  His mom came home at sometime and brought him some Taco Time.  So he had a very fine lunch.  Perfect amount of food this time cuz Tyke was hungry.  The meal is usually quite a lot of food.  It was very good.  Tyke then returned to play some more PS2 and later Tyronious called him up.  So he let him come on over and they played some games on the PS2 and then since it wasn't raining at the moment they went out to play some bball.  Tyke was his usual great FT self but he missed his 10th FT so he only got 9 in a row.  Pretty poor by his standards.  Oh well.  The rain came back when the two were shooting around so Tyke was just about to leave when it stopped so he went back and started shooting again and then it started up again.  So he once again was about to leave and it stopped.  Then he just said screw it and took a couple more shots and then left.  Then it started raining again.  They went back, played a few more games and then Tyronious left.  Tyke putzed around for a little while and he just remembered that Purdy called him earlier and they are going to hang out during/after the girls game on Friday so that is cool.  Cuz she will be back then.  So thats definitely cool.  Haven't seen her in a week.  Dotti is the same but she is gone the whole week.  That is sad.  Won't see her until school starts up.  And that is not going to be a good time.  Well, the rest of Tyke's day.  He called his mentor and is going down to KING again tomorrow at about 11 to just hang out with him for the day.  Probably not going anywhere and it will probably be pretty boring for Tyke just cuz he won't be watching anything.  It will just be sitting and watching TV semi-uncomfortably for about 8 hours maybe.  Who knows how long he'll stay?  It will all depend.  But he will rack up the hours and he only needs 10 more.  He has like 2 months to do so too.  He could go every day for like 10 minutes.  That is how much time he has left.  Not much.  Later on in the night Tyke was playing poker with Kinker and Tyronious online and they set up plans for their own card game at Kinker's house.  K-caj, D-Cups, and Macaroon were also additions to the crew.  Tyke was the big man at the table.  He ended up winning 14 bucks and his 5 he put in the pot.  So he came home with 19 bucks but went in with 5.  So it was a +14 profit.  Very nice.  That is 3 days of lunch right there.  Amazing.  But he knows that he isn't good.  He was just getting great cards for most of the night.  He knew what to play when and what to bet.  He isn't bad but he isn't like the super poker genius.  Just a solid player who isn't too hard to read but isn't easy to read either.  A straight shooter some could say.  He didn't bluff at all tonight either.  Didn't really need to actually.  But it was fun.  After poker the gang played some MOH and then Tyke came home.  Tyke needs some rest though cuz he has to go to Seattle at like 11.  But thats ok cuz it won't be bad.  Ok, have fun stopping now.  Stop.
