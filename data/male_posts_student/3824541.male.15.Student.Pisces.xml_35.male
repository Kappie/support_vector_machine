Not that exciting of a day. I don't really feel like going out. Maybe I'll meet Mandy at the pool later.  If you know me you'd know I've been grounded from my computer for like six months. My mom passworded the thing, and now I can only get on when she's home (She uses the password). Last night when I got off I turned it on sleep mode so I could get on it today. I thought all was good, and I got on at about 10 this morning. Then at 12, for the first time ever my dad came home early for work (He hasn't missed a day of work in nine years). Luckily he's sleeping so I guess I'll be on until he wakes up and yells at me.   .Characters  (In order of appearance) Dad - Abe Abdalla - Manager dude at Frito-Lay. Sick Today. Bobby - Best friend.
