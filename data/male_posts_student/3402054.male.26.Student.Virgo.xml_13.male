I slept from 8:00 pm until 6:30 am this morning and then jogged for the first time in at least a month. So this weight is the absolute lowest weight with which I could hope to begin. I expect it will go up before it goes down. But at least I have the supplies for my Insane Hollando Diet: two burgers in the morning, spinach chicken salad for lunch, and shrimp or chicken for dinner. That's the plan over the next week as I take my last law school exams and then the Bar exam on Tuesday-Thursday, July 27-29.
