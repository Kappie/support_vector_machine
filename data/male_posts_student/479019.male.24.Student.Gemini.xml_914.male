I think that I felt that, because it's a song about So Cal and I'm happy to be back.  Speaking of  urlLink Bad Religion , I did some rearranging of my room yesterday. I moved a lot of my furniture and stuff around... including posters. It looks like I have a Bad Religion wall now. Actually that side of the room is the rowdy Albert side.  Wow...  urlLink Flogging Molly 's "The Likes of You Again" is playing now. Good music! So Cal has awesome radio. Indie 103.1 might be owned buy a subsidiary of Clear Channel, but it's one of the best stations I've ever heard. It was playing some Sham 69 the other night!  I really like the new set up for my room. It's much more roomy and it helps that I threw out a lot of junk. So I feel less surrounded by crap. I want to pay either Target or Rite Aid a visit for some cheapo frames. I wonder if I should walk to Rite Aid or if I should see if my old bike still works  Today I pretty much just plan on relaxing and reading. Maybe do some drawing or painting?  ****
