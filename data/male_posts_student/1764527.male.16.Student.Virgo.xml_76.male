I was in his room from 1:45 p.m. until basically 8:30 p.m. That's a long @ss time to be in there. Brad also helped me. He was "Mr. I;" I was "Mr. Hear." HAHAHAHAHAH! Get it? lol 
 In other news, after leaving a message that talked bad to someone in a nice way, I got talked bad to today in a rather nice way. Although, she knew I was not talking about what she was talking about. She knows what I mean, plus she's still doing exactly what I said she prolly would. Enewayz, I need to call Millie and write a poetry response for English. Good news: I finished all the Calculus I needed to do because I Mr. Aihie helped Brad and I until 4:00 p.m. and then we worked on it for the rest of the time. 
 FWIW: Coach Fey went off on me today. It was rather funny. I was walking into the gym to go to the weight room and he yelled, "What do you want?" I said, "I'm not talkin' to you" and kept walking. "I didn't ask if you were talking to me, what are you doing? ... Don't walk into my gym with that attitude. ... I don't want to see you come through here ever again. ... etc."  thought it was kinda funny though, cause he was really working it into a big deal when it really wasn't.
