Everyone in my family is pretty certain i will be able to sell it! I'm pretty happy now.   So yesterday, we did'nt go to the movies. Instead we got up the road to piquete and went to a family party at  Wanderley 's Farm. It was nice, and i had to try " The Hot Whine ", god it was so good!   Also,  Paulo  is suppose to meet me here and lend me  Dungeon Siege , looks very promising.   School tommorow. I had a 4 days weekend so it will be hard to return there.  Regards,  Zephyr
