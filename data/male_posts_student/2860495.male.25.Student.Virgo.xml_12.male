This process repeats for months with me asking them when they'll have an idea of their schedule and then I check their website and they have one confirmed show after April and that is on my June 5 wedding day.  Did they notify me?  Hell no.  I still like them, but I'm a touch pissed off.  I'll go see them if they come and play.  I'll hopefully get over it soon.
