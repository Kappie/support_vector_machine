Would sugges that other workshops be about this size as well. Quality not quantity.    Also suggested that workshops for youth leaders and possibly kalakalan be encouraged.    Interesting idea would be to set up a school in Sitio Bacolod which is the first sitio you reach on the way to Pilien (Bacolod is roughly the half-way point).  For the children who live farther, a small dormitory could be built and to keep the teacher in the community perhaps a small staff house could also be built.
