DEAL WITH IT YOU MUTHA FUCKERS! i'll be back on friday night and will probably write about this on saturday sometime. the thing that i am goin to in louisville is call Passport, it is a mission project camp thingy that is kick ass fun and i wish i could go every 2 weeks but i cant:( yes my friends it is that fun, so i get to wake up really early tommorow morning to leave at 8 o'clock and i am just hopping that it wont rain that week. so cya all on saturday and btw justin after saying our bands name, Damned Nation, in my head it hasnt sounded as good as i thought it would, and my parents "dont approve" of it and would like me to change it. so if any of ya'll have a good name for a punk/punk rock/rock/ska band leave a comment with it and we might just use it if it is good enough cya
