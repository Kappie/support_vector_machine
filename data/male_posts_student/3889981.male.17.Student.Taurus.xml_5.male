SAD SONGS (Say So Much) Music by Elton John, Lyrics by Bernie Taupin (Performed by Elton John)  Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain And ironing out the rough spots Is the hardest part when memories remain And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio Cause from the lips of some old singer We share the troubles we already know  Chorus Turn 'em on, turn 'em on Turn on those sad songs When all hope is gone Why don't you tune in and turn them on  They reach into your room Just feel their gentle touch When all hope is gone Sad songs say so much  If someone else is suffering enough to write it down When every single word makes sense Then it's easier to have those songs around The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you And it feels so good to hurt so bad And suffer just enough to sing the blues  Chorus Sad songs they say, sad songs they say Sad songs they say, sad songs they say so much Chorus  ------------  I love this song because of its rhythm and the way the lyrics fit into life. Ever since I started listening to songs (not just oldies) I've been trying to find how these songs fit into any aspect of our lives. Some do, most don't, but this fits just like a missing piece of a jigsaw.
