We talked every single day for at least 5-6 hours every night and then we talked on the phone a lil bit too. well we finally decided to meet. the day he came over to meet me i got hit by a car so i was havin a bad day but all that went away when i saw him. i was so excited to meet him. anyways we hung out a lil bit that day then he had to go to work. then the next day he came over and spent the night kinda, he had to leave early tho cuz he had to work at the Lilac parade (he was a crowd control person...he works for the SPD) so we watched movies pretty much all night, and he cuddled up next to me, and like 5 minutes later we started making out. this was my first time ever doing this with a guy. or anybody to tell you the truth. and it went a bit further but im not gonna talk about that. anyways after that i started to fall in love with him. and then the day after i pretty much asked him out, he asked me if i wanted to see his new boyfriend. i was so depressed! and he didnt even care. then he started bein a real asshole to me. I guess getting hit by that car the day i met him shoulda been a sign :-p. then he wouldnt even tell me when his graduation was, and we dont talk anymorel. which im fine with now. only time he ever IMs me is to see if he can have my laptop. i wish i never met him. i luv you Jake thanks for helping me through that! i dont know what id do without you... remember im always here for you too. but anyways thats what happened with Cameron. thanks for reading. check back later for more :-)
