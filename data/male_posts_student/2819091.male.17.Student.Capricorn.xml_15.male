Am I even consider a great character? Am I worthy enough to be great? What will death give me in exchange? What kind of deal could we arrange? I've had it with the hate, I've had it with the torture, I've had it with the depression, I've had it with everything. What will I get for giving up? I'm damned to be tormented when I am alive, Either way I'm damned when I am dead, So what choice will I have? All I know is that I am damned either way...
