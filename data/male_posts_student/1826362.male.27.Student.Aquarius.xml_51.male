We were neck and neck and then  we were tied at the final question which was worth more  points than the other questions.  I had my question first.  But instead of being like all the other questions, where they asked it, then one by one  the answers appeared, it was this long list of unrelated  words, and I had a couple of seconds to memorize them, then I  had to repeat them.  I tried my best but I could only  remember the first word on the list.  I felt bad, but was  still hopeful that maybe Chip wouldn't do well either (the  prize, by the way, was one million dollars).  then chip gets  up for his question, and it was just like all the other ones,  a question and four answer choices.  and it was a really easy  question too.  so he gets it right and wins the million  dollars, and I felt bad because I lost, but I also felt  cheated, so I started complaining to my frineds that my  question was harder than his, and the worst part of the whole  dream was that my other friend Sean didn't care, he thought I was  being a whiner and a complainer, and I lost fair and square.   I was so upset.
