Two reasons why: 1) We have a new student in our class, Alejandro from Venezuela. 2) We were doing paper mach√©. So it ended up being rather boring. I'm working with Alex (a confusing situation here: we have an Alek (me), an Alex (my partner), and an Alejandro (our new student).) on the project and we ill-fatedly decided to do a cat. It's rather deformed, but I have been forbidden to speak about how bad it is (I  was  being rather dooming), so I have hopes for it. I'll let you all know how it turns out.  Quote of the day:  To be able to fill leisure intelligently is the last product of civilization, and at present very few people have reached this level.  (Bertrand Russell (1872 - 1970),  Conquest of Happiness )
