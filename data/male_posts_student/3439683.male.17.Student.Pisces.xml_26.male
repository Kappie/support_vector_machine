There are some days where I want to be depressed, because I see nothing to be happy about. I hate having neutral feelings. Today's just one of those days. I want to be....something, want to feel something, but I feel just empty. Visiting my grandparents in Illinois isn't going to help, but that's where we're going for a week and a half. True, I'm going to get to play golf in Branson, MO while I'm over there, but....there is NO ONE even close to my age that I'm going to see. For a week and a half, I'm stuck with people that are at the very least, 30yrs older than me. I went to the beach with them a few months ago, just one day was enough to get me really depressed. At least I won't be feelin nothing....aieeee, I've got to go already.
