Well, my name (Edwin) was actually originated from Germany and girls were named Edwina. Anyway it means "Prosperous Friend" and no wonder, i have so many friends all around me wheather malay or indian, chinese or sikh.... i always seem to comunicate well with them and i also can comunicate well with people that i've never seen before especially in Friendster. The other meaning is "Heir's Axe" and i'm not quite sure what is the meaning of it...... so for anyone that knows the meaning please drop me a comment. Yeah !!! This is intresting, for 14 years.... i never knew that my name has a meaning........ Ooo yeah!!
