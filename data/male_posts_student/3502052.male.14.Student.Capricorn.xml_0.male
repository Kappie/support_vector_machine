The side that we hate usually contains the choices the concern our future.  these ones sit here and we have total control over them, but at the same time they have total control over us.  We tell them where to go but they do the action.  They do exactly what we tell them to do and that is a lot of power.  As power hungry as humans are we dont really want it.  We dont like having to control our futures, but we still enjoy it with the little choices.  We only ever want power to show that we have victory.  These choices make or break us and that FEAR eats at us until we do that.  Once we overcome the fear we are on our way to true greatness.   We do enjoy some choices.  When we've had nothing to do for a while a choice can give life new meaning.  When we have too many choices, we get stressed.  Then our light, for fun choice becomes an omonious omen.    We must make choices, they will never leave us.  As humans we have many emotions and that can complicate things.  Imagine if we were happy all the time.  it would get rid of choices, but would hurt us.  we'd be happy to kill, happy to eat poison and die.  We need choices to be safe and life our life rather than another page out of a book.  In the end we need to remember that to keep life interesting we need to have choices no matter how hard they may be later.  We cant have perfection.  There are going to be some flaws, and we've got the best flawed life you could want
