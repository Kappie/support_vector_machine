I noticed that the first song radio stations play off a new album is one you could really point out. Ever since The Strokes came out with Room on Fire radio stations have been playing the song 12:51, A LOT! I mean, don't get me wrong, I really like that song. But one of those songs like I mentioned that you can point out is the second song on that album called "Reptilia." Now that's a DAMN good Strokes song. I hate that no radio stations play it, especially since 12:51 is getting kinda annoying.   So, if there's any DJs reading this, play the second single off of Room on Fire. Everyone will like it. And for everyone else who just listens to music, go and pick up the new Strokes album.
