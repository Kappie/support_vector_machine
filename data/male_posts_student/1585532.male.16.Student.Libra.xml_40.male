As I round off the end of the weekend by sitting here watching the final hours of this three-day weekend from hell pass by me, let me tell you how Disneyland was.  It sucked.  Plain and simple.  Why?  Here's why.  I really didn't feel like getting off my ass to go to DLR on Sunday.  Waking up at 11 AM, and hearing my family going ballistic on each other.  There's an instant sign that this days gonna be great...  Anyways, we go eat at Carl's Jr.  Which was pure and utter crap by the way, nothing had any flavor what-so-ever.  I'm pretty sure I tried about 4 different sodas, and they all tasted the same too.  Like crap.  Okay so we leave and head out to my Aunt's/Uncle's house. (Conviently located about 5 mins walking distance from my house)  And, we head off....  Car ride was somewhat decent.  Mainly arguing, light cussing, nothing real severe.  So we get to the parking structure, park and go on the best ride.  The tram!!  Okay not the best ride, but hey, at least it hasn't derailed and killed someone...  Get my new Annual Pass (ie Anal Pass for all those 4,000 lb assholes who screw the entire park over and think they deserve every freakin thing their cholesteral clogged heart desires, and to that I say, screw you, damn smacktard assholes), which has no blockout dates, not like it really matters since I'm not actually going there all the time.  Okay so we get into the park, and dump about $120 on food.  FOOD!?  WE JUST ATE AT CARL'S!  Well...I didn't eat anything all day actually.  All I had was a chocolate milk.  Thats about it.  Then its time for us to go on rides...erm, well most of us at least.  My cousin (who wanted to go with me but I wouldn't let him, my patience has worn thin long since before I stepped foot in the park), my sister, and another cousin went off and did rides.  God knows what they did, like I care.  As for me, I just dropped by the arcades and smoked a few kids at DDR, always fun.  After that I just...roamed really.  Nothing in Tomorrowland was open, save that Star Wars ride and the Car Ride.  Screw that, I'm not waiting 40 minutes for those rides.  Oh, Splash Moutain just re-opened from a breakdown..5 minutes eh?  Okay.  So I walk to the ride...walk by Indy-40 mins, Pirates-30 mins, and HM-20 mins.  I get to the enterance of Splash and it's a freakin hour wait already!  So screw that too.  If I want to get wet, I'll just take a shower..communists.  So I walk over to the nearest thing.  Haunted Mansion.  Wait in line, which had so many freakin directional changes that by the time I got into the ride, I had NO GOD DAMMED IDEA WHERE THE HELL I WAS!  Anyways, go down the elevator, blah blah blah, more lines, get a free fastpass thing to ride again, go on the ride.  Repeat, except for waiting in line thanks to the fastpass.    Okay, so HM was fun.  Now off to something else.  Oh oh what's close?  Pirates is close, 20 mins..eh not bad.  Okay fun yah blah blah waiting in line arrr yo ho yo ho okay over.  Pretty decent, kinda cool after I saw the movie.  Okay what next?  Well...Indy is close..okay.  So I walk over to Indy.  Get single rider thingy, and wait like...10 minutes.  Some kid taught me some crap about  the FastPass machines that can possibly get me kicked out of the park, and then I rode.  Fun.  Okay, so time to go meet up with family.  We do, and...we go on Pirates again all together in our own boat.  Get off.  Starts raining.  We go home.  Ride home:  I'm hungrier than god knows what, and my parents stop at McDonald's (yuck).  I eat a salad, and have a coke.  Stay up till about 1 AM, and then drop into my bed.  IT'S OVER!  Yah, really..it is.  So....bye.
