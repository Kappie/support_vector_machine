If you know what I mean. Anyways...  Summer is here! The weather is FINE at the moment. I've actually been getting outside for some excersize! Amazing! Well, that isnt really hard to believe when you live in rainy old Aberdeen. It usually looks like  urlLink this   The fact that I just found that picture on a website whcih declares the name of a cemetary underneath the picture just makes it all the wierder. Bleh?  Goodbye munchkins.
