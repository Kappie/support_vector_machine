Sometimes I wish I could get up easier.  A lot of the time AFTER class, I wish I were more awake to learn the material.  That is the main problem with school.  I spend most of the time trying to get myself awake to just pass the class.  I'm not sure that more sleep is the answer.  I've tried that.  At this point I don't know.  But I guess the good news is that I'm feeling more inclined to do better in classes.  Recently I did well on a chemistry test that I didn't study for.  That may sound weird as an example but what I did during that test was different than other tests.  I focused on the test.  For the whole test, for once, I had little distractions.  I ended up getting an A- on the test and was very happy with the effort I gave.  Part of the problem with me is that I get in a funked mode of 'I screw up, I can't screw this up.'  This ends up being a distraction beyond my control.  I worry so much about what would happen if I fail.  I worry so much that it scares me.  I loose sleep because of it.  In the simplest of situations, "[I] don't apply [my]self."  Somehow it boiles down to my inability to form a plan for my life, I think.  I go crazy sometimes just thinking of things.  Cause and effect.  What if this and that happened.  That would cause this to happen and that would be result of that happening.  I do it all the time.  Not just before I got to sleep.  In my house, in my room, in my bed, outside, in the school, in the halls, in the classrooms.  It's everywhere and sometimes it just eats me up.  My thoughts boil do to simple things and theories I use to justify my actions.  I trade theories off.  I act out things in my head and see the best result, I think.  The sad part about what I just wrote is that none of it probably makes any sense what-so-ever.  I don't even feel like rereading it right now.  I'm just going to let it go.  But anyways, let's think of something else I can rant about.  Ok.  I cut the side of my left index finger.  Paper cut.  Pretty deep.  It got infected, I saw some pus coming out.  Very annoying when I curl my finger.  Anyways let's talk about something else.  Ah.  My web page is up, sort of.  I got a basic design I think I'm going to run with.  I don't know what the hell I'm going to do next, but we'll see.  If you care to see me finish it soon, let me know.  Otherwise I'll just procrastonate and never get it done.  Cool.  That's enough ranting for one entry.  Damn, I don't even feel like going through a spell check.
