I have a weakness for videoclips that have slowing down and speaking up like in one of atomic kitten's video clip be with you.  ok kick ass song "lets get retarded" by black eyed peas its beginning is kinda meh but once it gets in it rocks. *prays to the god itunes music store* i was like hmm i need more music so i looked up some artists i liked (and i use the term artist loosely) and listened to some obscure songs on their albums and woah i have been missing out. the problem is i also found some rocking bands but because they were too obscure they werenht on kazaa yet. iTunes is my new god, im actually going to buy an album tomorrow because i can't download the songs on kazaa and iTunes music store isnt in aust yet. Obviously i like the music  So I leave you with these words of wisdom: everybody get intoit - get stupid get retarded!  1up 'shroom: 'amanda' a singer  Poison Shoom: The Beatles for not being on iTunes Music Store, but dont worry i forgive you because your cute, actually thats a lie your HOT
