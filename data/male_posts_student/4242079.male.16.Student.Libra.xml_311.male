The store is in shambles right now, they took half our lights out and put them in the new store, so it is somewhat dim in here. The back room is a mess, because they took our shelves and put them in the new store, as well. Ah. The joys of moving.   This job is driving me squirrely. I am pacing around, like some kind of animal trapped in a cage (despite all my rage). What I need is a change. I don't want to hate old people, i don't want to hate children, and I don't want to feel that I have to rip people off so that I can barely scrape by financially.  I think my days as a RadioShack whiz kid are coming to an end.
