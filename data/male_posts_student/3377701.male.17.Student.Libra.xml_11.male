Our first "ponteng". We had more important things to do. We had to get our phones. Kafaii met up with us and off we were to the nearest Optus outlet. ( Optus is something like Maxis ) Me and kafaii got ourselves Optus pre-paid, so its free for us to call each other now. Not to mention its free to Karen and Daniel too =) Next up, we went to Exhibition Street to get our internet cable connection ( for me and lip zhun ) It was quite a long walk, and it took us a while to find the place. We got ourselves a 190k cable connection. We were hungry then, so we dropped by at the nearest Hungry Jack for lunch. Fastfood is , after all the cheapest meal around. We then rushed back to try out our internet. Worked like a charm. Super fast too. I downloaded stuff at 100kb per sec. That's about 2.5X faster than my streamyx back home. Coooooooollll! Couldn't enjoy it for long though. We needed to go college , for subject selection. We left for college, and found ourselves back in the apartment in less than an hour. The subject selection didn't take long. We got back just to find out that....our internet was not working! Darn!!! Had no choice but to take a nap , praying that it'll work when i woke up. It didn't. Damn. Dinner time. We had a good meal, at A1 again. Roast duck rice, yummmmmm. It's always good to have some Chinese food once in a while. Went back to the apartment, and Internet's back on. Hurraayyy. Jenshen and Kwok Liang came over for a while, just to catch up on old times. Played a few games of DOTA , dont you just miss it ? =)
