"c'mon guys stop f'ing around, this is high school" - something i would not say. but the winter sports banquet... that right there was my excitement for the week. wait i got a haircut and went to cooker's for dinner yesterday. ladies and gentlemen a tie for the excitement of the week. absolutely spectacular. today the weather is cold and windy, it's kinda setting the tone for today: i keep wanting to go out and do something but eventually it gets to be too much and i  have to give up and come back home. maybe to arabica with a small group of friends would cheer up things.   so the main topic of conversation with my mom and i happens to be the war with iraq. two people that have lived in the same house for 15 years could not have different perspectives on this stuff. she's totally war opposed, hates politics and me, i like the strategy of war and want to be a political analysis in the future. and my take is this war is a good thing because it will help major deal (not totally) with all that corruption and stuff that's going on. best of lucky and safety to the troops over there protecting us.
