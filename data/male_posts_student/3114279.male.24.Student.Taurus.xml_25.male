      So Lake City for five days was ok. Every time I end up going there I try to reevaluate my life and what I'm doing. Would I like to live in a small town? I guess, if I could write, and obtain some kind of notoriety. Not like the fame is the most important part of it all, but at least recognition would justify it a bit. I still don't really know what I want out of life. Every now and then it'll be like something clicks, for just a second, and everything almost seems clear and I can almost cling to some kind of direction, but that fades and I'm left where I started. It's usually landscapes or sunsets that trigger this. I think it reminds me of home, like Nova Scotia home. Maybe some kind of pilgrimage would help clarify things a bit, or maybe I just need to sit down and think what I want out of life. Not my parents, not my friends, but me. Hm. I had a nice and funny long diatribe about umbrella holding, but I'll wait on that. Sometimes you just need to vent, regardless of whether or not it would make for an interesting post. So, you want a classic top ten list? But what about the seven out of my top ten movies which were already earlier than 1980? Well, that ain't gonna fly. So I'll tell you what. I'll make a top 10 movie list of movies that I watch the most often, regardless of how much I appreciate them as cinematic. So here it is, my "Nick Dalyesque Top Ten Movie List"  1. 2001: A Space Odyssey  Sorry, but I watched this movie every night for like an entire year. It still makes number one.  2. Dawn Of The Dead  And this one is also a repeat. My bad.  3. Revenge of the Nerds  I just put this one at number three to get all the repeats out of the way. No matter how cheesy this movie is I still almost choke up at the end.  4. Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan  Yeah yeah, this is everybody's favorite, but it's still damn good. I don't even think Shatner's acting is that bad, to tell you the truth. And it's not just a space shoot-em-up; the getting old theme really plays through it quite well, and even now I can start to identify. James Horner's great score is also a plus.  5. The Big Lebowski  There are few movies I can quote to the same degree as this movie. I haven't seen it in a little while because somebody has my copy, but if I wanted I could probably just act out the whole damn movie anyway. I have a feeling this top ten list is going to be mostly comedies. Oh well.  6. Wayne's World  This is one of said few movies I can quote as much as Big Lebowski. Yeah, it's stupid and immature and adolescent and aimed at a target audience of 13 year old boys, but it's still goddamned funny.  7. American Grafitti  If I was in some other mood this wouldn't make the list, although it is still great movie. I get these weird kind of nostalgic chills watching this movie. Not 60s nostalgic, because I wasn't even alive then, but nostalgic for some era in my own life I can never go back to. Almost like I missed out on something. This is the kind of mood I've been in. I'm being pushed in a direction by everybody else I don't want to go in, and yet I have no idea what direction would be better. Watching this movie makes me think about how great a filmmaker George Lucas could have been if he didn't get wrapped up in almost thirty years of star wars.  8. Back to the Future  I saw part III first, but this is the best of the trilogy. I still love all of the repeat stuff they did in part two. You really don't find filmmaking this joyful that often anymore. Ahh, the 1980s.  9. Kill Bill (both parts)  Ok, here's my recent movie. I saw each part five fucking times in the movie theater, so I figured it justified it being on this list. Both parts never got old, either. Great movie.  10. Army of Darkness  Heh heh heh, what a ridiculous concept. I love that this all spawned from a low budget practically student film. Yeah, it's not the best made movie out there, but it certainly is enjoyable.  So there yous have it, another ten movies I like. On a lighter note, Jane convinced me to wear a coral (pinkish) shirt to the wedding on saturday, which was cool. It was much less boring than my grey shirt with grey suit. Anyway, I stopped in lake city to fill up on gas on the way home, when this truck filled with locals starts whistling and saying "hey, look at that fag." Ahh, lake city. Where does the time go?
