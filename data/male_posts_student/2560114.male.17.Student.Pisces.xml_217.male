But the passing and hittin drill wit the serving machine we did improved from the other day we did it. Then when i got home i went to borderz and got me a biography on bernie mac and a dvd of comedy presents: jim brewer, so it was tight. this is all for the english project so yeah...get me to buy stuff about comedy is a good thing, hahaha. well tomorrow is the big day that we play montebello in the 1st round, supposebly they are a bunch of short aznz so yeah, its gonna b interesting...payce.
