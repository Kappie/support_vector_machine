Well today I got the results back. I'm in the 98th percentile of all sophomores. Yay! It feels so good to hear how smart you are from people who could care less.  And in other news, I've started a band. Well, not me specifically, but some people from school have joined together to form a band and I'm included. I play keyboards. Apparently, we're punk. I'm not a fan of punk, but who really cares about that anyway. I did hear some talk about covering some Pink Floyd. That's more up my alley.  That's all for now.
