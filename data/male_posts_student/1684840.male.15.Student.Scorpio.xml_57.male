I was really late and I hadn't got my food ingredients ready so I had a mad rush around the house getting those ready!  I left the house about 8:50!  I know, very bad!  But that's not why it was strange; when I arrived at school, the bell went at 8:55!  How weird, it was as though it waited for me to arrive so I wouldn't be late haha :P  The overall day at school went well :)  We baked scones (or scons if you're like that) in double cooking, which I really like!  I wish I had a coffee through Information Systems.  It's getting terrible slow and it's hard to stay awake sometimes lol :S
