I don't know about the rest of the A11'ians...I didn't feel good largely over e GP essay...the rest of the time i was sulking during Geog, Ms Lee  still  talks like a dumbass robot. Anyway yeah guys it was nice eating at TCHS today *opps...the rest must be jealous* reminiscing of e good old days we had during e first three months...oh well let's look ahead...better days await 04A11.
