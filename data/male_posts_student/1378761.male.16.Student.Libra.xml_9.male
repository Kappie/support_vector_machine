Last year we made a powerpoint going along with the Alan Jackson's "That September Day". That was the one of the best projects I really enjoyed doing. This year for  urlLink MTV  we went around interviewing people, asking them about what they was doing and what they felt. I haven't seen the final product yet, but it is going to be good.  I bought a new video card today to go along with my new system. I found out that my video card, not my memory, was causing my computer to freeze. So I got the ATI All In Wonder 8500DV. Now I can do a little video editing on my system.   I think I am now officially out of money. I really need to get a job. Somebody hire me please!! I am going to bring my digital camera to school Friday. I need to get some more pictures. I love pictures.   Something really made me mad today. We I went to check out the  urlLink news  in 8th Period, There was some 9/11 virus out. That's really crummy. That's the kind of viruses that I really hate. Get a life people, please!  Their is going to be a special on  urlLink TechTV  Friday about the RIAA. It's a 2 1/2 hour special with my favorite  urlLink Leo Laporte  co-hosting. Watch it - That's an order.   We'll that's about it for now. Hope to blog you soon! ``Eric``
