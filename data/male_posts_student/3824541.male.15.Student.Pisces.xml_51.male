I was walking down the hallway smiling at people, and nobody even looked at me. Later, I had nine files in my hand, and I walked down the hallway, and like seven people gave me "The look." The one where you're not sure what they mean, but it's not a compliment or anything nice. The strange thing is that after the first few times I visited, everyone talked about how nice looking I was, and how nice I was. Peoples are dumb ;\.  Yesterday I started  Nectar in a Sieve  which is actually an OK book. It's about this Indian (India) women and her hardships. It has a lot to do with sex though so that makes it kind of interesting. Not erotic, but it holds my interests in some scenes. As of now I'm on page 120, and I'd rate the book a 6/10. Where I am currently, it seems as though it's a bunch of situations put together. It's starting to all connect though.  I'm going to jump from Erotic Indians to clothes. I've decided to return a pair of pants I bought... I don't like them as much as I thought I did. The good thing is I have $150 in Pac Sun bucks, so I can buy some stuff.  Hmm, one last thing to talk about and that's meh haircut. I kept the top long; I'm hoping it'll be down to my eyebrows one of these days. I got my mom to cut the sides though. I like it, but she doesn't. Oh well.
