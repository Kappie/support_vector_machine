I made a right turn at one point and turned in front of one of the county blue trucks, and saw some of the guys I used to work with.... Chico being riding in the middle.  I ended up at a piano lesson with my old piano teacher from when I was in 4th grade. She wasn't there yet, so I was left waiting. I noticed a book while I was waiting. The book was huge and green and called "Tobacco Chocolate". I remembered that my teacher was against tobacco and gave many seminars on not smoking (this is only true in the dream). The book had a little sign on it that said it was from Satan.   I sat down across the room from the piano and waited. There happened to be a bunch of kids playing Texas Hold Em in front of the piano on their own round table. My piano teacher showed up, gave me a big iced tea, and we began to walk to the piano to play. I had to get around the table of kids. The kids had to lift the table a little to let me through. My piano teacher and I then sat down to begin the lesson.  THE END
