Apparently, a few of the girls have called him to "just hang out," and he is now dating one of the contestants.  Nicole Chabot , Andy's publicist, has remarked that the two have gone out together after various taping sessions. I promise that as soon as a picture of the duo hits the net, I'll post it just to use this caption:  "Dick, hanging out."
