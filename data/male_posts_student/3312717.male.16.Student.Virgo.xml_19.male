I'm amazed at how light out it is, and how a bunch of people are already showing up for earlybirds. I'm not tired enough to get more sleep, so we play a bunch of cards on the way down. Driving by Discovery Middle School in Alex, I see the time is 8:19.  The guys are just getting ready to say the Pledge, and we're already in Alex.  We eat at McDonalds, since I guess we're corporate whores, no pun intended with whatever Stanek said at that same spot. I got a large cappucino. It sort of woke me up, and tasted good, but it was hot, which I didn't want at the time. Upon getting back to Discovery, we stepped out and saw our breath. Yeah, it's the 24th of May... We hit some balls and warmed up and all, then met our opponenets. Heading to our courts, I feel drops of water.  Ah, crap.  We head to the High School and wait no less than three hours while individuals are seeded for Wednesday. During this time, we slowly degraded from watching "Holes" on the bus to exploring the school, to playing check, then fooling around in their indoor batting cages, followed by a game of basketball using tennis balls, which shortly turned into standing at opposite ends of the gym and whipping the balls across William Tell style, although whenever the balls  did  get close enough to make contact, we'd just move anyways. The ride back was a morose affair of sleepiness and partial watching of "Dragonfly," coupled with soreness from the seats and the small charlie horse I contracted during a coughing fit around 2 am. This was subsequently followed by me rushing up to Chemistry in the nick of time to absolutely bomb the organic chem test. I banked on C-O-C being ether, and pulled that one off, but I only knew alcohol and carboxylic acid outside that one, so I did extremely poor. I'm hoping the final will push my grade through at an A-level.  The Halo tourney sounds like fun; however, I foresee us getting pounded. Especially in the case of team slayer, in which it would be 5 highly-experienced players against about 3 experienced players, 2 fairly good players, and 3 chickens with their heads cut off (myself and the oselands), and this is given that the player TBN isn't worse than Kraus. Capture the Flag would be much more even... although I'm still scared even of this. We'd require an excellent defensive-maneuver player, being that we have 3 good snipers in Driller, Johnny, Holby, a few crazy flag-attack freelancers in myself and Kraus, and a more organized and methodical attack system formed of the snipers, Eric, and Mattson. Unless we can stake out a defense around the base, we need someone good in close quarters, and who is willing to take on guard duty.  In conclusion, for those of you who read my dissertation back on NationStates about Meowtopia not needing military or space programs since these are world-wide ideas, only needed to be undertaken by the number one in the world, the U.S., I've found a nice quote that sums up basically what I was saying.   "I wish that all Americans would realize that American politics is world politics." -Theodore Roosevelt
