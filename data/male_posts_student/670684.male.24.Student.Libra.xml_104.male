Jack's acting in the piece was incredibly stellar, and I thought he rose to the occasion even more than Brody possibly because his material wasn't as good (which brings to question how  About Schmidt  won Best Screenplay, but that argument is for another day), but even though I enjoyed  urlLink The Pianist  more, I can't complain about Jack winning the award.  Excellent performance.  And who wants to pass up a chance to see Kathy Bates naked?    I passed across a great, quite controversial website yesterday entitled  urlLink Black People Love Us .  The website is about two white suburbanites who are just loved by the black community; it includes testimonials from black friends (such as, "Sally is always trying to hook me up with black people from her work.  She knows that because I am black too, we must have a lot in common.") and pictures of the loved Johnny and Sally partying down with their black homies.  The site is an amazing critique on hegemonic racism in society; it deconstructs the idea that racism is a thing of the past, and that discrimination is no longer alive.  True, the facets are different, but  urlLink Richard Dyer  was right; white priviledge still exists, and those of us who benefit from it are often too naive to realize that we are benefitting at someone else's loss.    I truly believe that most people consciously don't want to succeed at the sake of others failing, but at the same time, no one wants to give up concessions in order to pull people up from the bottom.  For equality to honestly happen, whites must lose status rather than blacks gaining equal footing...the men in power will always think of ways to keep the Good Ol' Boys club in order, and pass the hand-outs to their friends.  Whether it is about race or if it's class I don't know...but no matter how scathing and sarcastic, Black People Love Us is definitely something to be studied.    Happy Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  I'm not a big fan of holidays, but anyone who has ever read  urlLink Letter from a Birmingham Jail  can see why this man got his own holiday.  There have been a lot of great fighters and martyrs in the Civil Rights Era, and MLK probably gets credit for the actions of many of them, but he is deserving of it.
