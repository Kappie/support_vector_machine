Things are going well, yesterday was the first day of 100+ degree weather and it sucked. Hot as balls. I have to open the book store tomorrow so that is nice, will be off in a short amount of time. Nothing really going on besides the same stuff. Little weird things here and there but not wrong writing about, well, maybe - If I had more time....
