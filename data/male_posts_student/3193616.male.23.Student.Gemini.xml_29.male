I am not surprised. Given the current political situation in the country, Left and Left of newspapers face this uncomfortable situation. Though they doesnt want to support the Congress Government on issues like FDI and others, they find it inevitable in other issues. So, they try opposing the Govt over the issues selectively and start glorifying even trivial issues like writting letters. Even with a single letter, Hindu has pronounced judgement that PM is following Nehru. The desperation to give credibilty to its opposition to the Govt and to its own credibility and so called" Neutrality", they would continue doing this. But said what may be, all my knowledge(even substanially small n trivial) about politics in this country, I owe it to "The Hindu".
