This site will be dedicated to such things as my fav. bands, games, songs, movies, etc. AND of course, you guys. don't be afraid to poke around and just ask, "wtf?" cuz I sure as hell will answer you, and thats becuz I have nothing better to do then to tend to the needs of complete strangers. So welcome, and make yourself comfy, the best you can at least, cuz there are no couches here, just rocks. or something to that affect.
