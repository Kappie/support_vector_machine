Bought back lots of pressys for the whole whanau ;-) Parents bought two shirts back from the US, size XL, and believe me when I say this, these shirts are bloody large! I mean, I would fear to ask what what an XXL would look like! going by the sizes I run, I must be the equivilance of a Medium in US sizing ;-)  Anyway, lots of study, finally got that damn system analysis stuff out of the way, lets hope that everything stays on track for the end of this year. Lets hope that the IT job market picks up, and if worse comes to worse, I'll head off to teachers training college and become a teacher.  btw, I'm online now, I'm on MSN, just use the email address to get in contact with li'l ole me ;-)
