I don't remember whether I have posted my views on the entire episode, but here's what I think of the matter.  I think that the fact that CAT has been busted and that the culprits are behind bars, does ensure that those folks who would have got admission into an IIM solely on the basis of a killer score( courtesy LEAKED QUESTIONS) will be weeded out. I think that will pave the way for some fair competition at the GD/PI round.  Okay, so I hear you wonder how much of a difference that it's going to make. Apparently, quite a bit. Ask any one who has been associated with any IIM and he will tell you that there ARE donkeys along with horses in the IIMs. So now we know where the donkeys come from. Okay apart from that, life has been just swell. I never have had life so good. For the first time in many years I have been really happy. It's almost as if this was the only part missing. A single person has come into my life and made my whole life more meaningful.  Had a great last weekend. Pritam was back in town for the weekend, from his gruelling training session at TCS. So we got together and had a great time... Shiva, Pritam and me. Had a bit of a misunderstanding with this really nice person, but no real harm done since things were sorted out easily. Also had a great lunch. So until next time....  TAKE CARE FOLKS....
