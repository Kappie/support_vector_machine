HE SAID HE LOVED HER god damn it.. and i am supposed to keep my cool.. trust her.. oh yeah.. i told her i love her.. yes.. i admit.. i may have said it too many times... but each time i say it, she just keep quiet.. and just now, she snapped.. she told me to stop it.. haiz.. as if i am a tape recorder and says it just over and over and over.. but it's not.. it's not... everytime i say it.. damn it.. with the bottom of my heart.. and.. i dun even know if she has already liked another guy, chosen another guy but just not with him physically or whatever.. but heck.. in a conversation, am i supposed to ask her, "hey esther, are you sure, are you lying to me" i can't.. it just seems wrong.. it is not as though i dun trust her.. but what she does.. is like damn hard for me to trust her.. to go to the staduim with i dunno how many guys... and.. say, "i goin to eat now, msg you later" and just hang up my call.. more than 2 hrs later.. it's 11pm for heaven's sake and you're not home?? come on.. dun you know i will be worried.. or you think that after you say "let's break" and i forget all about you.. it's impossible.. haiz... what i am doin.. i dunno if it will change what she thinks.. i dunno.... i really dun.. and it is tearing me apart.. really tearing me up.. from the inside.. bit by bit.. every day, i miss her... i've never missed anyone so much.. i thought that in school, when i am surrounded by ppl, i can do things, keep myself busy and quit thinking of her for a few minutes.. but eventually, i fall.. i crumble.. yes i am weak... WEAK.. ithought i would never beg, never grovel, for someone to love me.. but now, i am doin it for her.. and for her to tell me, "i dunno what i am feeling" haiz.. it just breaks my heart... everyday, i miss her.. and everyday, she sees the guy in school... i feel that i am losing..bit by bit.. but then again, have i already lost?  headache... 5th day and counting.. olympics coming on tonight.. i can't sleep... guess i'll be watching...
