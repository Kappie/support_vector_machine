This guy just doesn't give up! He's still chaining me up inside his mind, just because he's afraid to hurt his twin sister. I'll wait for some time, although I might have to let him taste my power for him to allow me to come out. He nearly unchained me when he almost killed his classmate with a little rock, and that was when he was just in grade two. Oh well, instance wasted. I think I was still groggy then. But now that I'm awake, this girl steps in and helps her twin brother chain me up. Maybe I should teach him a little prayer to give him some power. I'll think it up first. For now, that's all, and again, Watashi wa  Shi wa Tenshi !
