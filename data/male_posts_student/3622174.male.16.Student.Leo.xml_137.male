Windows XP, unfortunately, does not live up to its potential to be a strong, good operating system.  So, as my friends may have heard from me in the past few weeks, I am planning, within the next year, to switch to an Apple iBook, and eliminate the need for Windows XP for good.  There are some minor issues regarding my internet access, like, will I be able to use my network adapter (which is designed for Windows XP), with the iBook, or will I need to find something Mac compatible that will integrate with the current home network?  I am definitely researching this.  Apple is so much better than Hewlett Packard, too.  The picture quality on any Apple computer this day in age looks 1000 better than anything that you see on Windows.  It'd help when I'm making stuff in Photoshop.   Anyway, now on to something else.  Digital Lust is over.  Too much to worry about.  This time I'm being serious.  All of the Digital Lust posts will be ported over to here in the next few weeks.  To replace it, I'm starting a blog of all the Photoshop things that I create.  I'm working on some creative new ideas, and I'm going to post them all, instead of posting them on somewhere like Deviantart or somewhere like that.   And then, there's the new moblog.  All the pictures that I take from here on out are going to be available on my new moblog (don't worry, they'll be posted here, too, but, also on the new moblog, for easy archiving).  This eliminates the need for me to use "Hello," which takes me a long time to use.   And, that's all for the nerd part of this post.  In six days, I'll finally be 17.  Thats right, fools, I haven't forgotten yet.  Now, come Friday, I may forget, but, I'm taking every step necessary to ensure that it does not happen.  So, rest assured, people will not be reminding me that its my birthday this year.  Let's just hope that another hurricane doesn't threaten to come through here again.  Well, that's it from me for now.  Tonight I'm going to make fun of peoples' blogs for the first time in nearly two weeks!  Or, if I don't do that, I'll post something else!  See ya!
