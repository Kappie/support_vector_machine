Thomas and I stayed up and debated policy initatives and Old-School Nickolodeon Shows until one.  Building a playground was fun even with the presence of butt-guy.  Levi's open house was entertaining, I compared Levi to a "drunk woman who shakes her breasts." Somehow Kafkaesque got in there. Levi and Colin did the duo and it was good. Leeches are funny.  However, I was greatly entertained by a picture of a certain blog founder in third grade. I'm working with the Comstocks to get that picture online. I wanted to see other yearbooks, but all that Jonah found was the Everyman edition of The Canterbury Tales, there was a bare-chested woman on the cover. Needless to say, I coined the term "The Canter-booby Tales." So, yeah... And then I asked again to see a yearbook and Jonah presented me "The Case Against Spanking".   Very Entertaining Day. More Later. I love you, so much. Your Daughter, Claudia. Is that a rocket you've got hidden there?  No, it's my cookie.
