My father got the results from CNA half an hr after I woke up. L0L! But it was betta than nothing. I set off to school again after a month of Holidays.  Assembly was boring, a hell lot of talk. But some1 was trying his best to distract me, who else but tt Fat Pussy Cat ! L0L! Wad an idiot! He kept calling my name and when I look at him, he turned away. Now tt's wad I call a gay act! L0L! Let's juz hope tt he doesn't see this. Wahahaha. Anyway the day was pretty boring and I was pretty tired, I dun even noe why too. L0L! During my Food  Nutrition period, Hongyue was asking me to go to the National Stadium this Sat, cuz of some1 in B.B!? (definitely not those in my cls, pls dun get the wrong idea, her taste isn't tt BAD!) But still, my god! L0L! I said "Go for wad? Who wanna see these 2 lj face!?" (pointing at the fat pussy cat and the lil' pig) L0L! Tt was kindda mean of me, but still Hehehe. Lil' pig was pretty insulted by it and had a hell lot of reaction. The fat pussy cat on the other hand, kept quiet cuz he knew tt was basically the truth. L0L!   I realised during F period tt lil' pig veri poor thing, not enough money. *sobz* *sobz* Since I'm sucha wonderful caring  loving brother unlike SOME ppl, I decided to gif him a treat. L0L! He became happy in sucha flash. L0L! Haha, and wad do u noe, the fat pussy cat was there and he wanted a treat too! Sucha greedy lil' !@#$%^ L0L! Dun care him! He is so damn rich and shld be the one who treat me. Wahahaha, he always claim tt I'm mean and unfair when it's actually him. L0L! Well, nvm, I can't be bothered bout' him. L0L!  I had to stay back after school to complete some work given to me for an English workshop the nxt 6wks or so. Hongyue and I were in class tryin to do the compre, but we juz couldn't concentrate. We decided to tell Ms Tang tt we decided not to go for tt thing. We told her, but changed our minds in the end. So we juz had to shuddup, suffer and do it. Nike~ Juz Do It~! After tt, we decided to haf a meal, but the hawker centre was closed! L0L! We decided to grab some stuffs frm 7-11 and ate them at the hawker centre. Well, tt wasn't enough, the portion was so miserable. Hongyue didn't like wad she got too, so we went to the bakery~ L0L! We got some buns frm there and ate along the way to the bus stop. My bus came first, but I chose not to board it in order to spend some quality time wif her. Haha, but her bus came like 3mins after my bus left, so it was kindda ... -.=" Haha, well at least the time we spent together today was worth it.  I realised tt spending time wif the ones u care and tresure bout' is realli important. It's rare tt both of us spend time together, but I'm glad we did today. I noe there are others who I hafta spend more time wif, but it's like so hard to do so. In order to spend quality time wif some1, I think tt it's juz hafta be u and tt person. Nobody else shld be there. Tt's how I feel bout' wad spending quality time wif some1 is. Wad do u think huh? I'll leave ya wif tt thought. Till tmr, Cya~! Shawn Out! =]
