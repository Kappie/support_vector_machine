Here are the highlights.  Bloom's nose is featured in a section titled "Most Wanted," which details the "most wanted" lips, eyes, nose, cheekbones of the stars. The possessor of each perfect feature is described with a snappy, verb-centric sentence; for example, of Nicole Kidman's skin: "She glows." Or Johnny Depp's cheekbones: "He smolders." Of Bloom's coveted nose: "He commands."   That's right. Orlando Bloom's nose commands. It commands you! To do what, it's not entirely clear. Assumedly, to get thee to a rhinoplasty clinic.   ---  All the familiar characters are here: the token actress of a certain age (Diane Keaton); the token sports guy (Yankee Alex Rodriguez, barely nosing out his pin-up boy teammate, Derek Jeter); the token woman still desperately trying to shed the masculine residue of an Oscar-winning role (Hilary Swank); the token divinely anointed hunk of beefcake (Jim Caviezel); the token Jennifer Aniston (Jennifer Aniston).  ---  But where do we fit in? How do I compare on the percentile-scale of true beauty? It's easy to find out! Here's the formula: "To do a self-analysis, draw an imaginary line from the pupil of your eye down toward your jaw. Draw a second line from the nostrils across your cheeks. The bottom of your cheekbone should fall at or below the intersection of these lines. If it is higher, your face may appear flat and masculine."  If your cheekbone falls at or below the intersection of these lines, please take your flat and masculine face and report to your local repurposing plant, where you will be reprocessed as protein-rich feed for the beautiful.  She glows. She sparkles. He smolders. You suck.
