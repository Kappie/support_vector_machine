Becoming a pilot is my destination. “Sky is the limit.” One of the most used expressions in our daily lives. But if sky is the limit: “Is space over the limit?” This is one of the questions I have been asking to myself. In the future, or about couple of years from now, most of the planes would have the ability to go beyond the imagination of our tiny human minds. I want to ride and enjoy the high rich life of a pilot. It is in my ambition to explore the universe. The purpose of my existence in this world is to be a pilot.
