I could probably waste blog space by typing what went wrong with the weekends.. but I don't even remember anymore, so I'm not going to try.    Anyways, tomorrow is a civics trip.. missing one day to work, this better be good. The previous civics presentation we attended was surprisingly good. Some guy (i think his name was Mark Ford - can't remember too well) came in and sang/played guitar/played piano. The presentation was really good. He was funny and weird.. which is of course a good thing.    Right now, I'm listening to  "Shout it Loud"  from King of Bandits Jing.. I heard that KoBJ animation gets even better as it goes on.. (I won't believe it till I see it, as the animation I saw was already really nice).. but the plotline isn't too well cause the writer got fired in the middle of the series.    Lastly, I added a little special effect thingy to  urlLink my site . Have fun (but don't keep checking out the effect as it'd probably eats up bandwidth).   Yup, short blog entry, but oh well.   ~Chronos
