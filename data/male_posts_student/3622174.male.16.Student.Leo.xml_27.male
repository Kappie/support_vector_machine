StatCounter  Link:  urlLink Click here   This program lets you track how many visitors come to your blog, and who they are, and gives you even more detailed results, like how many new visitors you get every day, how many returning visitors you get, and even what Browser and OS they use.  All you have to do is copy and paste some HTML into your blog (I put mine in the sidebar for the counter), and you're all set to go.  This is especially helpful if you run a blog like this one, where you actually want to see who's looking at it.  Its easy, its free, and you can put all of your blogs under one account.  All you have to do is go to http://www.statcounter.com, sign up, and you're all set.  Setting it up is increidbly easy, and you'll be able to check your stats from the Statcounter site.     Blogskins  Link:  urlLink Click here   This is so you can find a new skin for your blog.  I recommend this to anyone who doesn't like the big, better looking skins on Blogger.  I'm not bashing this, but, I haven't found too many on that site that I would use, and I haven't found any that I definitely would use.  It's got some okay skins, and I have no idea how the installation works, but, I think you're better off using this if you're using FTP access to get to your blog instead of updating through the web.   Haloscan  Link:  urlLink Click Here   If you want a better, more detailed commenting system for your blog than the regular Blogger commenting system, this is where you definitely want to go.  Setting it up may be a little difficult for anyone who isn't big with their HTML knowledge, but, it works all the same.  All you have to do is put the HTML where it tells you to (check the FAQs on the Haloscan site to see where exactly its supposed to go).    Not only do they give you free commenting with abilities to ban, delete, and do other things to messages, but, they also give you trackback, which allows you to see who's been writing about your blog entries.  It's really easy to use once its set up, and all you have to do is turn Blogger's commenting system off when you get it in, and, you're all set.  And it works great.  Use these tips, because they will definitely help you customize your Blogger experience to make it the best it can be.  You'll add new levels of interactivity with your blog.  Next week, we're not going to have tips every day.  We'll be closed Monday and Tuesday, since I will be out of town, and then, for the rest of the week, I'll be wrapping things up for the month of July already (going to be out of town for the majority of the rest of the month as of this point).  We'll have all new daily features, like another Digital Lust war, one tip, and more.    Up Next on Digital Lust, your game of the day.
