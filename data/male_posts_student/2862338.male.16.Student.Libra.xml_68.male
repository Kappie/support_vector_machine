I dunno what it is....hmmmm   Hope you people like the picture at the top.  I didn't make it, so don't yell at me if you don't like it.  Leave a comment though!  anyway, i breifly copied and pasted the links code from my old template on to this new one, but it came out retarded....*HmpH*, i mean "Mentally Ill"...ok, fuck it, it basically came out fucked up, so i prolly won't try it again, unless i figure out HTML 2.0 or whatever the code is.  Hope you guys like the new title to.  THe old one lost all novelty it ever had, and just got to annoying to look at.  Kinda  like hearing the same joke over and over again.  yup....  you know what i hate? i hate when people think they got it bad.  Like, i hate when people think there "depressed", and  have alot of problems, and they make people think there gonna commit suicide.  Shit, you people wanna hear problems, you come talk to me.  I have MANY problems, that won't even touch upon anything ANYONE has trust.  Just on two little peices of info i know, i automatically hold more problems.  If i realease one, it changes my life forever (it sounds ridiculous, but you really have NO idea)...and one, not so big, can really mess up something my freind has.  Thats NOT to mention school...which i havent done good at at all this year, which limits my chance to get into a good college, my car being fucked up, loosing my wallet, which contains my lisence, which stops me from driving, PLUS my brother and sister-in-law crashing at my house, rendering it a complete and total mess, my DCA, which, if dosn't get appealed, meant that i went through that whole class for nothing, PLUS just the fact that i don't have alot of money....shit, let's break that down....moeny...."boo, hoo, i have problems, i have this, i have that.." holy mother fucking shit...QUIT ALL YOUR BITCHING. you know what sets me appart? i DON'T HAVE A HOUSE....i live in a fucking basement appartment....ok, so while your living in your 3+ room house, i'm stuck in a mother fucking basement.  I should be so lucky to even say i have a car, and digital cable, and DSL, i really should.  I don't take anythign for granted like most people do, i fucking appreciate how i got my shit, i don't just use it, and cry about it when i don't have it anymore.  thats why when i play music, i don't just go online, and read off digital paper, thats why i don't ask someone how to do something, i try and figure it out, try to appreciate it, and put my own self into it, that's why i never try and show off, thats why i hate making fun oof people, thats why i hate when people think there better than someone else, and don;t even have the common curtecy of showing some fucking respect.   Then people go on about there problems, tried and true to the blogging way of life.  lemme just write down all my problems, and there we go...it's not like that for me...it would be impossible to show you all the problems i have ever had.  Even now.  Your problems are a break up, no g/f, no job, all that shit, mine is that shit x2.  fuck, i'm gonna go more specific on that "life or death" info just so whoever is reading this has an idea.  What i know, can cause my parents to get a divorce.  I'm not just saying that cause thats what i think...i'm saying it cause thats what i know.  it almost happened once for the same reason,  and i know if i tell anyone this, it's over.  Can you understand what thats likes?  who do you follow; what do you do?  Whats the right thing to do here? should i keep it to myself, and pretend like it never happened, and just let it keep on eating me like a fat kid eats a cake, or should i do the  "right thing" tell "someone" and let a marrige, a family, go to nothing?  holy fuck! i just really can;t imagine the shit people say, when they have problems.  They don't have problems, they just don't appreciate, they see things in a different light, a dimmer light, which dosn't let them see the true shape and form of things.  "aww, i don't have a g/f, i think i'm gonna go cry now"...that was my attitude, but, for what? crying don;t get you know where.  "aww man, i just broke up with someone.." so what? i'm sure it's tuff, but why look at the negatives? now you know what not to do, and create a better and more fruitful relationship for next time.  People this day of age don't appreciate shit.  They take everything for granted.  They think they got it sooooo bad, but they never really sit back and have a look at where there thinking about it.  Your house, your amazingly big house....i've NEVER owned a home, let alone live in one.  The closest i  ever got was that big as apartment i was so fortunate to live in for a couple of months.  thats it....all my ife has been is appartments, no more, no less.  I could never call a place a home.  I've moved more  times that a human blinks.  but you know what? that builds character, it makes you a person, not just a follower.  Not just someone who thinks highly of themselves.  i don't go around saying a play the guitar, i don't go around proclaiming my poems as works of art, i don't do any of that.  myabe i should...maybe i should go around proclaiming the fact that i "taught  myself" the guitar....maybe people will be impress? maybe everytime i jam with someone, i'm gonna go play the latest flavor of guitar i know, infront of you, and make it seem like i'm better than you.  Maybe i should act way more mature than i am, and not have any fun at all, never let go, always thinking i'm an adult.  Maybe i should always order the same thing at a resturant, never get anything different, claim i'm open-minded, and say it to your face, maybe i should make fun of you, blaintently, poitn out everything that pisses me off, just dismantle you with words, but never tell you, and still call you my best freind.  Maybe i should try and help you, get you to go in the gym, but you still won't come.  Maybe i should tell you about everything on my mind, and you still don't know what i'm saying.  Maybe i should say thanks for being a freind all these years.  Maybe i should just stop.  Maybe i shouldn't.    I like what jorge and hernie have.  I like what me and andy have, i like what rob and healey have, i like what jones and me, and mike, and the fucking rest of us have.  Freindship is good, but it's only a freindship if you don't talk behind peoples back. I HATE when people don't appreciate shit.  Like rob.  Apparently, the way he acts, it's almost like he expects a ride from me everyday for lunch.  Like, he KNOWS im gonna give him a ride, and if i don't,  he gets pissed.  If i don't give him a ride home, cause his mommy can't pick him up, he gets pissed.  Shit people, fucking gas is expensive as fuck, you should be so fucking lucky as to even fucking SAY you have a ride.  I like giving people rides ok, just not everyday.  Especially when people need to fucking walk.  i absolutly hate it.  they get in my car, slam MY fucking doors, and pretend that it's suppose to be like that.  Well, when i get my car back, no more rides.  It's only gonna be when i fucking decide it's gonna be.  It's not that i'm mean, ti's not that i'm being selfish, it's that i'm being real.  No body seems to thank my, honestly, no one really apriciate, they expect, and thats juss fucking rude.  On monday i'm gonna need a ride...might get one, might not, but atleast when i get one i make sure to say "thanx alot so and so,  really aprciate it", and not try and say it like i didn;'t mean it.  i do mean it, i understand the everything involved in taking me home. shit people, we gotta fucking change...   i'm tired of ranting, i'll rant some other time...
