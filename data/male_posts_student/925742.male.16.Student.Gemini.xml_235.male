Endangered species, caged in fright Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight The stage in set, now pay the price An ego boost don't think twice Technology, the battle's unfair You pull the hammer without a care Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man Pseudo-start, the hunt is canned ... The hunt is canned  All are gone, all but one No contest, nowhere to run No more left, only one This is it, this is the Countdown to Extinction  Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare The skin and thophy, oh so rare Silence speaks louder than words Ignore the guilt, and take your turn Liars anagram is "liars" Man you were never even there Killed a few feet from the cages Point blank, you're so courageous ... So courageous  Chorus  One hour from now Another species of life form Will disappear off the face of the planet Forever ... and the rate is accelerating   Ok, the lyrics may sound very green-peacey, but the sound is badass.
