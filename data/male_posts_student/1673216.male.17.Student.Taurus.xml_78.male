Three people in the open space. Both having completely independant conversations. I am in the middle, in neither of the conversations in particular. Simply listening. But...it was...very...confusing. To the right is a debate about the tragedy of life and the validity of relationship itself, and to the left is a distorted conversation debating about penises and other rather interesting body parts. Just funny to sit in the middle, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. I laughed.   Something serious:  Outward appearances versus feelings. Good god. In the words of Scott, "I didn't even know there were people like this in the world." How can you be this happy-smiling-outgoing person on the outside, but then transform into this protective shield of a person that can't even decipher their own feelings. I dunno how to deal with it. Not going to even go into it. This wont even make sense to most people. Story of my life      ---------- PS: Sleeping is great. I hate when people abuse thier body for school work...Man, I hope all you IB kids take like a 5 day nap!
