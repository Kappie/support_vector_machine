My schedule was as expected, and driver's ed resolved to second semester. I am so relieved. Of course, now my dad wants to buy all my books online but that was such a hassle last year that we just ended up buying them from the bookstore anyways. He seems tottally convinced that there is some new part to the process, but I am really balking. anyway, I hear him finishing his shower, gotta go.
