A: you want to know about my sex life?! Q: do you work, or have you ever worked, in the following professions? A: (interrupts) NO! Q: (continues) banking, market research, journalism.. A: we don't even OWN a computer!! Q: what brands of cell phones have you heard of? A: i'm not interested in what you're selling! (click)  sigh...this next guy could not seem to grasp the concept of the survey:  Q: do you know what a cell phone is?! A: i just moved here!  apparently, my introduction is confusing to other people, too. sometimes i get frustrated and go off the script:  Q: would you like to take a survey?! A: i don't know how.... A: i am the people not working here home now... A: sure, my motorola isn't working! i can't get service out here on suchandsuch road! why won't it work? i tried blah blah blah. one time i had to blah blah blah... A: i do not have any opinions...
