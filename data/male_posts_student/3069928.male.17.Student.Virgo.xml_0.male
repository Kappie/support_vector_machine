I've been watching all the news today concerning his attitude toward the judge. I've been watching all the news today concerning what Saddam's future holds. I've been watching all the news today concerning the outcry for his immediate execution.  I've been watching all the news today concerning the people who sympathize with him. Primarily, the socialist loons in Europe.  I know this is a clich√© argument, but how could a sane mind of any man sympathize with such a ruthless, autocratic barbarian such as Saddam? Tens of thousands of people died by his political tallons, yet not one socialist in Europe is calling for the death penalty. Why? Of that's right--they never were in the first place. These were the same people who wanted Saddam to be tried at The Hague in the The Netherlands, but the US rightfully shunned that request away, so the Iraqis, the prime victims of this tyrannical monster, could try him accordingly.  But the French and Germans see it otherwise.  Claudia Roth, the German government's top human rights official told the AP earlier today, "To start out this way does not send a good signal. I think it would have been a signal of democratic strength had they not reinstated the death penalty in Iraq."  What does she mean by "good signal?" Iraq is now a free and sovereign nation--and by that logic, the Iraqis have the ability to do  whatever  they want with him... it is their freedom to do so. Oh wait, that's right, now I remember, this is coming from the same country who is instituting regional unionization in Europe, hoping to sap power away from the individual citizens of that continent. Now that I think about it, I'm really not surprised--these are also the same folk who wanted to rule the world at one time.  France wouldn't hold their tongue either--earlier today they asked the Iraqis to hold a trial which would conform with international laws.  Yes, yes. The same international laws which prohibit death to the world's most hardened and ruthless dictators. The same international laws which have kept Solobadan Milosevich awaiting trial for well over two years now. The same international laws which seek to undermine every element of sovereignty and individualism across the world. I'm sure the story with France would be different if they were prosecuting Nazi war criminals who uncontrollably ravaged and raped the French countryside during WWII. Ah, yes, "death" isn't so bad after all, is it Mr. Chirac?  But what about the bigger picture? What about the European Union?  Don't worry, they're just as diluted as well.  Emma Udwin, the external relations spokeswoman for the European Commission declared that the EU intended to let Iraq know about its opposition to the death penalty.  Seriously, who cares? Last time I checked, Iraq is not part of the European Union. Oh, silly me, I forgot! Europe  always  knows best... even when it comes to new Middle Eastern democracies which have lived under the hand of a barbaric dictator for almost 4 decades. Yes, Europe always knows best... wasn't Nazism a fantastic idea?  Also, has anyone noticed the split in the European Union? The western part of Europe which has enjoyed freedom since the end of WWII is becoming increasingly socialist--while the eastern side of Europe, which was oppressed for the better part of the 20th century, is becoming increasingly more and more individualistic. Just today, Poland's Foreign Ministry Spokesman, Boguslaw Majewski, said this about the Iraqi trial of Saddam:  "Our reaction is obvious. This is a sovereign decision of an independent court and of the Iraqis themselves."  And rightfully so. Anyone who understands freedom understands the right to capital punishment... unless of course you're from France or Germany. Let's just hope they don't try and influence the Iraqis to make their constitution 100,000 pages like they did with the EU's.
