What is the surprise in a foreign Govt enquring about a comedy strip that has come to don the railway minister post in the name of democracy. I strongly beleive, the politics as practised by Laloo is a bunch of Mabocracy. sigh...... n there is a newspaper, which publishes this as a great event and takes pride. Where are we still?. In 18th centuary?
