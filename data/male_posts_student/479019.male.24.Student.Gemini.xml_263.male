I'm thinking of making enchiladas for Stephanie's potluck thing on Thursday night. So I'll have to pick stuff up to make them.  Man... I've been so tired the past few days... that one night that I went to sleep at 7 AM jacked me up big time. I went to sleep last night around 12:45 AM and I got out of bed around 2 PM today. Maybe I should really look into some gym time to boost my energy levels as well as add some regulation into my life?  Oh... I'm no impressed by  Weezer 's  The Lion and The Witch  EP. Maybe it's because they've put so much of their live stuff out on their webpage, that the novelty of having it just wasn't there?  One Man Army 's  Dead End Stories  (1998) isn't as good as their  Last Word Spoken  album. I'm really tempted to get their new album on BYO along with the  Anti-Flag /Bouncing Souls split. Then again that's money that I really shouldn't spend.  ***
