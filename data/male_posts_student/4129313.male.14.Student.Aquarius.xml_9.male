Thats basicly how boring it was today, nothing realy happend at all today. All I did was watch Spiders and Spiders 2 on the Scifi chanel. I did work on my desktop a few hours, so now when I press the ~ key it shows up, and is defaulted to hidden. I am still working on a way to change it to hide/show based on how it was last time I hid/shown it. I'm guessing its an advanced CSS thing with javascripts or something. I still want to figure out a way to delete the Desktop.htt file and refresh the desktop through javascripts. I want to be able to change the html file and see what was changed when I refresh instead of having to goto the display property's and reaplying the html as my wallpaper. I still need to come up with a readme file and upload it to somewhere.
