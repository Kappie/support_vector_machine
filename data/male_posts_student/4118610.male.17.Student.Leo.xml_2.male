You see, it is not only a tree, it is telepathic. Unfortunately, the building and development process still need work. That is why I need the defense department or japanese investors to fund this awesome project. So if you are a japanese investor or a defense department official, get out your check book and gimme an email. If you wait, then the terrorists might get this idea first and take over the world!!! I have illustrated one of the trees many practical uses, and am working on more. It will be posted soon, as soon as I can figure out how to post a picture.
