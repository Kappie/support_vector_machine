The four killers, armed with aluminum baseball bats, forced their way into the home where the victims were in beds early Friday morning, and beat them to death -- just as Victorino planned, Johnson said. I suppose headlines such as "Xbox killers" and "Sheriff: 4 charged in Florida killings over Xbox" make for sexy copy but what really happened is that, allegedly, a bunch of thugs killed people who were asleep in bed. The fact that an Xbox was misappropriated is tangential to the larger story.   While I'm sure I would see red if someone stole my game console, I don't think I would feel justified in beating the perpetrator to death with a baseball bat. You have to understand that I own a PS2 and play Grand Theft Auto quite a lot. If I want to beat someone to death with a bat, I'll do it in the game. (Cue: New call for more strict regulation of violent video games... wait for it...)  What about a comprehensive "assault bat" ban? I mean, you can't tell me that those aluminum bats are useful for hunting... er... bunting. Bats don't kill people, stolen video games kill people. Personal responsibility, anyone? Anyone? Bueller?
