I picked up a GBA SP at the Circuit City, and I have to say, it's extremely entertaining. I have Fire Emblem and Advance Wars 2, and I have been playing them almost every spare minute. It was great for stuff like heavy traffic and down time around my uncle's house. While we were there, the area was absolutely packed. After we saw the Thunderbirds, the traffic was so bad it took well over 30 minutes just to get across town to the Sonic. My dad and I also went to the Wyoming Air National Guard (WANG) air base to see the show they were putting on. We saw all sorts of planes there, including a  massive  C-5 transport plane and a Huey from the Vietnam era. Later that evening, we went to a night show (concert). Trick Pony and Keith Urban were playing. Trick Pony was OK, but I was wishing for my GBA for most of the show. Keither Urban, however, was astounding. His music was good, and he is a master of the guitar. At the end of the show, every single person in the stands was standing up and cheering. It was amazing.  We came home from that on the 30th, and packed for a trip to  urlLink Lake Angostura . We were there for 4 days and 3 nights. It was an excellent trip. In retrospect, it seemed much longer than it was. I had a ton of fun just camping. Our site kind of sucked: no trees, on a hill, and the beach was very rocky. It was relaxing, though, and a break from having to worry about what's going on anywhere else.  I've got to get to work tomorrow, so I'm off to bed. Before I go though, you I wanted to hook you up with this link:  urlLink My War . This guy is on the front lines of Iraq, and he's telling it as he sees it. That does it for me, but I'll be back tomorrow. Probably from work where I'm hoping we won't be swamped (still).
