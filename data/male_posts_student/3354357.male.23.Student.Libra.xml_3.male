I used to struggle with the fact that I thought that Christianty was a uniquely western thing, and since I was a westerner that it was just another fascet of my culture that explains how I behave.  It caused me to question everything: my beliefs, my prayer... basically it flipped my world upside down.  I have to ask myself, "what makes me different, being a Christian, than the next guy? Is that what I'm supposed to do because I am an American"  I questioned this for days.  It was actually the most agonizing three days of my life.  Eventually I learned that Christianity had something different than everything else, first, I didnt have to actually do anything for it, just recieve it.  and two, I have a tangeble thing that non-Christians don't have, the Holy Spirit.  Finally my evidence.   My point in writing that is most christians that go to church all their life, or at least call themselves Christians, don't come to this conclusion.  Then I started thinking thamaybe what I percieve as Chrisitanity is what a lot of people percieve.  I'm under this crazy idea that maybe, just maybe, we are supposed to be living by the spririt and trying to glorify God.  Through this, then we prove God to others, through what the Holy spirit has done through our lifes.  I started looking at what God has done to some of my "On-fire" Chrisitan friends and that was my proof.  Some of them, there was no damn way that they would change accept for love of God.  So how Chrisitan is societies "Chrisitian"?  This is where I began to truely realize that things arent nearly what they seem and there is the higher struth out there.  Sorta like in the Matrix, accept I didnt fallow any rabit, and Im not even close to learning Kung-Foo.
