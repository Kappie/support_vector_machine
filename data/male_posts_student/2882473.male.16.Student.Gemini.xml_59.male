The feeling is in-describable. I have a whole summer with nothing planned. I can do anything I want. Well, within reason. If you hadn't guessed already, my exams are over. Probably should have mentioned that earlier. :) Thorpe Park tomorrow, 'twill be fun. And then on Friday I must return to school to hand in text books, but that doesn't really count as school. Or not work anyway.  Well, business wasn't actually too bad, I thought it would be much worse. I managed to finish with a few minute to spare, and got some good points down for every question.  Now I'm free, I haven't actually got a lot to do, which was the main subject of my last post, and I won't bore you by repeating it all again. I'll have to start putting more time into my Esperanto learning, as  urlLink Nonnesuch  has started learning it, and I'd rather he didn't beat me at it. After all, I started it. That happened in my little pi learning competition though. I started learning, then Rob joint in, overtook me and nicked my 50p. :( So I must learn Esperanto good and proper, and remain the superior one.  And finally, I missed my goal. I didn't finish the Harry Potter books by today. Oh well, I tried. I'll aim to have them finished in a few weeks, and keep my pace nice and slow.  I haven't really got a hell of a lot to say, so I'll leave it there for now.  Cherio all.   Weather:  Light overcast  Reading:  HArry Potter 4  Listening to:  Lighthouse family - High  Watching:  Nowt  Confused about:  Business  Annoyed with:  Nothing :)  Mood:  Excellent. A bit hungry
