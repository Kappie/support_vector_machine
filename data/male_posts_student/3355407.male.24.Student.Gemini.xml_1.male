I get to Santa Monica about 515am and just sorta hang out until class starts.  Under normal circumstances I wouldn't go to school so far but I was already going there when my roomate and I had a falling out-I could win a worst roommate contest hands down-and thus I moved into my mothers house in Riverside and I haven't found a place to stay yet. Soon, maybe over the summer break I will get a place and in the fall I wont have to dive so freaking much. Gas is $2.60/gallon for premium. Its adds up.
