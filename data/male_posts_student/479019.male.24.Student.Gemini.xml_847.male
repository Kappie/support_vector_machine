I was listening to my new CDs while waiting for the bus at Walmart yesterday, and I couldn't help but remember listening to Weezer on the little hill infront of small gym back in Irvine High waiting for rides home. The summer before sophmore year and doing that for some reason is the most vivid. I remember listening to my mix tape with Weezer and Bad Religion on it. This was Weezer's  Blue  and taped versions of singles off Brandon's single and the Undone single I had bought myself. I was also listening to  Bad Religion 's  Stranger than Fiction  a lot. By the end of summer, I'll have gotten  Generator  and been listening to that a lot too.   I didn't get into the  Descendents  until later in high school... until after I bought  Somery  maybe at the end of my junior? I think I bought it was Circuit City...   Most of the CDs I bought in high school were from Tower Records in Tustin, and I think possibly one or two from the Wherehouse... now most of the ones I buy are from Amazon.com.  I feel kind of good that the bands I liked in high school are still active. I wasn't listening to any one hit wonders.  Oh for those of you don't know, I'm learning how to rollerblade to get my ass out of my chair and go out and enjoy spring weather. There are several reason's why I chose rollerblades... it's something new, I won't look like a poseur like if I had gotten a skateboard (remember when Hasani was walking around with one?), and they don't get flat tires. I remember getting lots of flat tires on my bike in the high school days. Biking home 3 miles with a flat tire is not fun.  ***
