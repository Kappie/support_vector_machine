My dad will then pick me out, we will check out the colored gel (its realy cool) maybe buy one, if the colors aint too gay, and then we will go check out a boxing club to see if i enroll or something. Then at 8, theres a [15 birthday] halloween party. i will probably take rene to the party. if i can, he lives about... very close to my grandparents, like 4 kms away from my house. well then i will take my spiked hair to the party again, well check out later how did ppl like it.  oh yeah, um... to go to the party you needed " halloween colors" like purple, orange, black, yellow.. (yellow? wtf?) and i didnt have any of these colors so we went and bought clothes, but i bought some coffee color carpenter[-like] pants and some weird polo shirt [no, not the brand] and some converse black boot shoes. i like my new shoes. i got home and put some yellow shoelaces on them. yay.  rene's number is... 285 24 01  yeah. bye bye
