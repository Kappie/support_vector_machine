What if I end up with a guy?  I guess I'm selfish, but I want my genetic material to be part of the child I raise.  And even then, what if I can't adopt because of fucked up discriminatory laws?  Fuck this.  Sometimes I just think I should ignore all this.  I don't need to question my sexuality.  I could just act like a regular heterosexual teenager.  It's not like I'm flamboyant or even effeminite.  God damnit.  This is why I don't believe in god.  If god made us, he'd want us to be happy.  But why the fuck did he make things so difficult for so many people?  Fuck god.  God let columbine happen.  God let world war 2 happen.  (s)he let's people take their own lives.  (S)he literally kills people.  How can anyone have faith in some sort of all powerful being?  Every time I question my own atheism, I eventually come to that same conclusion.  Why the fuck would god put us here and then leave us?  Why is Jesus so well loved when Sun-Yun Moon (sp?) is mocked by everyone.  For all we know, Charles Manson could be the second coming of christ.  God kills people, so why not his son?  Nah, parents are too hypocritical.  God would definitely tell jesus that he couldn't kill people, even though god did it during the 60s.  Or maybe god would just do something so fucked up that Jesus would lose all respect for him.  Fuck, it must really suck to be Jesus.  That was incoherent.  I apologize. -Mike  Walked around my good intentions, and found that there were none. I blame my father for the wasted years, we hardly talked. I never thought I would forget this pain, then a phone call made me realize I'm wrong.  And if I don't make it known that, I loved you all along. Just like sunny days that, we didn't know because. we're all dumb and jaded, and I hope to god I figure out what's wrong.  Walked around my room not thinking, sinking in this box. I blame myself for being  too much like somebody else I never thought I would just bend this way then a phone call made me realize I'm wrong.  And if I don't make it known that, I loved you all along. Just like sunny days that, we didn't know because. we're all dumb and jaded, and I hope to god I figure out what's wrong.  and I hope to god I figure out what's wrong.
