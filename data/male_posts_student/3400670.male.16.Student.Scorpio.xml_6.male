That's why the first amendment is there. It protects freedom of speech, and the freedom of not-speech. So if you don't want to say something, you're welcome to not say it. Don't start suing people because you don't want your kid to say it. I agree that little kids should know about the pledge, but forcing them to say something they don't know the meaning to is not right. If you want people to say the pledge, at least have the decency to teach them what it means first.
