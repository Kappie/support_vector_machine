Its things like i cant see what money has to offer for people that make lots of it and i cant see why people want to carry on making this woven peice of material with ink enbossed onto it. Whats the point of it when u dont want to spend it on people you love and cherish?  What is the point of going out with someone when u dont expect to spend the rest of your life with them? Is it for the sexual benifit or just because you feel lonely and dis-satisfied? Of course it is, i should say i aint got a problem with it and i have a bias because i feel lonely too. But i think that if you go out with someone you dont truely love for who they are then whats the point of wasting your time?  Anyways ill stop my moaning for now and ill bore myself with it all  Dave XxXxX
