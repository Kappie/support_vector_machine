Can't redirect the thoughts into another, Always focusing on this bother. What will happen now? These thoughts tearing the mind apart... Tearing the soul... My heart is breaking down, Breaking... The pain of it all... Only knowing now that breaking this habit is hard, The soul has become a retard. The mind has become a shard... A shard of its former glory. No longer functioning to it's prime capacity, No longer accomplishing what it could normally do. No more friends to stay by your side, No one to confide... No one... Except yourself. The pain... The torment... The torture... Losing one's head... One's mind... One's heart... One's soul... One's loved ones... One's everything. Everything is lost, only nothingness stays.
