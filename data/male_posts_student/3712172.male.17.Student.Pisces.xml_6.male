I was so tired, I slept till about 1:30 PM. I was up until 5 AM talking to  urlLink "Paco"  on MSN. I realized how much I want to visit New Zealand, seems like such a deadly place to visit. Taeghan, your a cool guy. :)  Tonight, the plans are to go see Chronicles Of Riddick at around 11. It should be good, I've heard its a good movie and Vin Diesel is a good actor, so I should enjoy it.   Last night we all went for coffee, and met some of Andrea's friends there. Andrea was saying the dumbest things, so all we could do was laugh at her and make fun of her blondness. Haha, but we all love Andrea. We got back to my place around 1:30 AM and watched 50 First Dates. The movie was awesome, Adam Sandler played his funny, yet serious role very well. I was impressed. And as for Drew Barrymore, she rocks in every movie she makes. She's one of my favourite actresses. And she's so beautiful.  Today is my day off, it was really nice not having to be at work today. I have some day shifts this week to work so it will be nice to rake in some cash.   Only 3 days until Canada Day! And I work, but only until 8! So I still have time to go all out, find a party, and get drunk. I am so pumped. I'm going to be wearing all Canada stuff. It's going to be great.  I will be updating the site shortly, I have some stuff to put up and change. So check it out in the next few days. I think I am going to get off of here and continue getting ready now.   .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Take it easy guys. I will post later.
