Mr Happy Go Lucky! In Japanese I would have been 'Mr Super Lucky Happy GoGo Rainbow Star Fat-San'  Now I feel like a schmuck.  No amount of 'The Clash' can make me feel better.  And you know?  I have only started to listen to The Clash only because Derek put 'London Calling' in the hard drive (aah, good ole mp3'z folder).  I feel like I need to make use of all the 6 gigs of music I have.    Its just that.... I don't know.  Fear?  Maybe.  I noted in my Autobiographical writing (which is extremely gritty and true, If I get it back, if you want, you people can read it) that I am a very paranoid person.  I feel as though most of my recent friends are just there to have me as a foil (a person who is comically awkward compared to them).  When I say that, I mean, my 'popular' friends.  Are they just there to not be there when I'm down?  Just there to get away with saying things behind my back?  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just paranoid like I always was.  Its just... I'm not a popular person.  Look at me, for God's sakes.    Then I post here, hoping that someone reads it, someone comments on it. I notice that I have gotten 50 hits in 5 days. You see that flooble?  Thats where you comment.  Not to fucking (jokingly) quote John Romero.  I recently made a comic.  Please, tell me what you think!  I am posting daily, and very deep things.  I am greeted with silence.    Thanks a bunch   And now I get all these mixed signs from people... and I don't know what to do or what to say or this or that.  I think of certain people a lot and I don't know why. I think of that divorce thing and hatred literally CONSUMES ME.  I feel like doing something, but want to be tactful.  Then I realize I'm me, and then realize I have little tact.  And look, now I think I'm getting teary-eyed. Fucking Christ.  What should I do?  Quaenam voluntas ego effectus?
