This movement has been led by  urlLink Swift Boat Veterans for Truth  who are using ads and a  book  to promote their claim that Sen. Kerry did not deserve the commendations he was awarded for his service in Vietnam.  I don't think they have a convincing case, but even if they did, this all just amounts to a big stinking red herring.  True, Kerry does seem to talk about his service in Vietnam every other sentence, but I think that's relevant either.  What I care about in this presidential race is who will be a better President.  What Kerry did (or didn't do) in Vietnam is largely irrelevant to the key issues (national security, economy, social issues, etc.).  I'm glad that the Bush campaign is distancing itself from this mess.  It shows that they are concerned with the issues, not mudslinging.  Let's keep in mind that President Bush has some nasty skeletons in his past, which most of the people in the nation have forgiven as part of his misspent youth.  If Kerry has done nasty things in his past, we owe him the same forgiveness we've given Bush.  Let's forget about the red herrings of Kerry's Vietnam record.  Instead, let's evaluate both candidates on the real issues.
