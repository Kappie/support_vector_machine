But then again, I always am so I guess that's no big change.  If you could be any condiment in the world what would it be?????  hmmm.... I think I'd choose guacomole, 'cause I'm probably the least likely to get eatin that way.  If you could be any meat dish, what would it be?  I would be a hot dog, becuase who knows what really in it.  If you could be any amount of money what would it be?  $42.00
