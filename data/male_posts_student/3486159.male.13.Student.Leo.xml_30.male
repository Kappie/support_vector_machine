So I stepped on the scale and saw that I weigh 135 lb. I got a prize for that. Then I went to another place where they had that. The woman guessed 113 (bwahahahaha)!! This time I weighed 137 lb. because I ate Mexican food and candy.  I am a fatass.  But, I truly believe that at least 20 lb. of that is muscle.  I am pretty strong, and buff... Really!!  I am not fat. I really am not... I don't mind being fat, but I'm not. I'm muscular.
