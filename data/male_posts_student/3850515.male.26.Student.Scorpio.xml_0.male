You can see the effect in the following trend graph produced with  urlLink BlogPulse's Trend Tool :     While the blogger reaction has been mostly negative, I believe HHS did the right thing.  By addressing obesity, the healthcare system will hopefully prevent other long-term, high-cost illnesses such as diabetes, CHD, etc.  The HHS press release states that obesity-caused illnesses burden the Medicare system with a financial drain in the order of billions of dollars.  Much of the hand-wringing being done in blog posts centers around that fact that obesity treatment will likely occur under the rubric of behavioral modification, but frankly, our populace  needs  to change their behavior.  The current  urlLink Harper's Weekly Review  briefly mentions research done by Antronette Yancey stating that almost half of  Los Angeles County residents get less than 10 minutes of exercise per week.  The Harper's review also mentions a Robert Hancox study that found children who watch two hours of TV a night are at a greater risk to be overweight, have high cholesterol, and smoke.  Clearly, a large portion of our country is living a sedentary lifestyle, and the medical community has a responsibility to alter this behavior.  Interestingly, I have seen a fair amount of activity in the informatics community directed towards such behavioral modifications:  ranging from smoking cessation to stress reduction.  If proven effective, such procedures will amount to no/minimal cost solutions for many of the conditions escalating healthcare costs.  I first became aware of such affective therapy in  urlLink this Wired Magazine article,  and  urlLink Tim Bickmore's doctoral thesis (PDF)  on the topic was also quite interesting.  I've included a list of journal articles on these topics below.  If you have any other reading recommendations, please leave them in the comments or email them to me.     Association between child and adolescent television viewing and adult health: a longitudinal birth cohort study  (Robert J Hancox, MD, Barry J Milne, MSc and Richie Poulton, PhD)  The Lancet:  Volume 364, Issue 9430, Pages 257-262 (17 July 2004)   Background Watching television in childhood and adolescence has been linked to adverse health indicators including obesity, poor fitness, smoking, and raised cholesterol. However, there have been no longitudinal studies of childhood viewing and adult health. We explored these associations in a birth cohort followed up to age 26 years.  Methods We assessed approximately 1000 unselected individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1972–73 at regular intervals up to age 26 years. We used regression analysis to investigate the associations between earlier television viewing and body-mass index, cardiorespiratory fitness (maximum aerobic power assessed by a submaximal cycling test), serum cholesterol, smoking status, and blood pressure at age 26 years.  Findings Average weeknight viewing between ages 5 and 15 years was associated with higher body-mass indices (p=0·0013), lower cardiorespiratory fitness (p=0·0003), increased cigarette smoking (p  Interpretation Television viewing in childhood and adolescence is associated with overweight, poor fitness, smoking, and raised cholesterol in adulthood. Excessive viewing might have long-lasting adverse effects on health.     Physical inactivity and overweight among Los Angeles County adults  (Antronette K. Yancey MD, MPH, Cheryl M. Wold MPH, William J. McCarthy PhD, Mark D. Weber PhD, Benedict Lee PhD, Paul A. Simon MD, MPH and Jonathan E. Fielding MD, MBA, MPH)  American Journal of Preventive Medicine:  Volume 27, Issue 2, August 2004, Pages 146-152   Objectives The present study examines sociodemographic, health status, health behavioral, and health-related self-perception correlates of physical inactivity in a large, multiethnic urban population.  Methods A random-digit-dialed telephone survey of a representative sample of 8353 Los Angeles County adults aged ≥18 years was conducted between September 17, 1999 and December 31, 2000. Data were analyzed to assess the prevalence and identify independent correlates of physical inactivity, defined as   Results Overall, the prevalence of sedentary adults was 41%. Lower educational attainment, female gender, advancing age, non–U.S. birthplace, poorer self-perceived health status, self-perceived depression, smoking, leisure-time television watching/computer use, and receiving a diabetes diagnosis were significantly related to sedentariness in both bivariate and multivariate analyses.  Conclusions Mental and physical health status were prominent correlates of sedentariness. Lower socioeconomic class was also associated with sedentary behavior. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between self-perceived overweight and sedentary behavior.     Effects of Internet behavioral counseling on weight loss in adults at risk for type 2 diabetes: a randomized trial.  (Tate DF, Jackvony EH, Wing RR.)  JAMA. 2003 Apr 9;289(14):1833-6.   CONTEXT: Weight loss programs on the Internet appear promising for short-term weight loss but have not been studied for weight loss in individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes; thus, the longer-term efficacy is unknown.  OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of an Internet weight loss program alone vs with the addition of behavioral counseling via e-mail provided for 1 year to individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single-center randomized controlled trial conducted from September 2001 to September 2002 in Providence, RI, of 92 overweight adults whose mean (SD) age was 48.5 (9.4) years and body mass index, 33.1 (3.8).   INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to a basic Internet (n = 46) or to an Internet plus behavioral e-counseling program (n = 46). Both groups received 1 face-to-face counseling session and the same core Internet programs and were instructed to submit weekly weights. Participants in e-counseling submitted calorie and exercise information and received weekly e-mail behavioral counseling and feedback from a counselor.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measured weight and waist circumference at 0 and 12 months.   RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses showed the behavioral e-counseling group lost more mean (SD) weight at 12 months than the basic Internet group (-4.4 [6.2] vs -2.0 [5.7] kg; P =.04), and had greater decreases in percentage of initial body weight (4.8% vs 2.2%; P =.03), body mass index (-1.6 [2.2] vs -0.8 [2.1]; P =.03), and waist circumference (-7.2 [7.5] vs -4.4 [5.7] cm; P =.05).   CONCLUSION: Adding e-mail counseling to a basic Internet weight loss intervention program significantly improved weight loss in adults at risk of diabetes.     Development of an exercise expert system for older adults.  (Boyette LW, Lloyd A, Manuel S, Boyette JE, Echt KV.)  J Rehabil Res Dev. 2001 Jan-Feb;38(1):79-91.   The purpose of this study was to develop a computerized exercise expert system (CEES) that creates tailored exercise plans for older adults. A panel of experts was selected in the areas of medicine, exercise physiology, health promotion, exercise psychology, and gerontology. The experts communicated with the principal investigator and the project members by mail, email, telephone, and expert meetings. A two-day workshop was held during the second year for the project members as well as local and national experts to review the CEES. The CEES demonstrated adequate inter-rater reliability (0.80) and criterion validity (0.70). Content validity was achieved by literature review and expert opinion. The CEES gathers information on the elder's health status, clinical factors, and exercise determinants that characterize specific barriers or incentives to exercise. The software program then develops individualized exercise prescriptions that are customized to older adults.     Print versus website physical activity programs: a randomized trial.  (Marshall AL, Leslie ER, Bauman AE, Marcus BH, Owen N.)  Am J Prev Med. 2003 Aug;25(2):88-94.   BACKGROUND: Mediated physical activity interventions can reach large numbers of people at low cost. Programs delivered through the mail that target the stage of motivational readiness have been shown to increase activity. Communication technology (websites and e-mail) might provide a means for delivering similar programs.  METHODS: Randomized trial conducted between August and October 2001. Participants included staff at an Australian university (n=655; mean age=43, standard deviation, 10 years). Participants were randomized to either an 8-week, stage-targeted print program (Print) or 8-week, stage-targeted website (Web) program. The main outcome was change in self-reported physical activity.  RESULTS: There was no significant increase in total reported physical activity within or between groups when analyzed by intention to treat (F [1,653]=0.41, p=0.52). There was a significant increase in total physical activity reported by the Print participants who were inactive at baseline (t [1,173]=-2.21, p=0.04), and a significant decrease in the average time spent sitting on a weekday in the Web group (t [1,326]=2.2, p=0.03).  CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences between the Print and Web program effects on reported physical activity. The Print group demonstrated slightly larger effects and a higher level of recognition of program materials.     Using Internet technology to deliver a behavioral weight loss program.  (Tate DF, Wing RR, Winett RA.)  JAMA. 2001 Mar 7;285(9):1172-7.   CONTEXT: Rapid increases in access to the Internet have made it a viable mode for public health intervention. No controlled studies have evaluated this resource for weight loss.   OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a structured Internet behavioral weight loss program produces greater initial weight loss and changes in waist circumference than a weight loss education Web site.  DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial conducted from April to December 1999.  SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-one healthy, overweight adult hospital employees aged 18 to 60 years with a body mass index of 25 to 36 kg/m(2). Analyses were performed for the 65 who had complete follow-up data.  INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to a 6-month weight loss program of either Internet education (education; n = 32 with complete data) or Internet behavior therapy (behavior therapy; n = 33 with complete data). All participants were given 1 face-to-face group weight loss session and access to a Web site with organized links to Internet weight loss resources. Participants in the behavior therapy group received additional behavioral procedures, including a sequence of 24 weekly behavioral lessons via e-mail, weekly online submission of self-monitoring diaries with individualized therapist feedback via e-mail, and an online bulletin board.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body weight and waist circumference, measured at 0, 3, and 6 months, compared the 2 intervention groups.  RESULTS: Repeated-measures analyses showed that the behavior therapy group lost more weight than the education group (P =.005). The behavior therapy group lost a mean (SD) of 4.0 (2.8) kg by 3 months and 4.1 (4.5) kg by 6 months. Weight loss in the education group was 1.7 (2.7) kg at 3 months and 1.6 (3.3) kg by 6 months. More participants in the behavior therapy than education group achieved the 5% weight loss goal (45% vs 22%; P =.05) by 6 months. Changes in waist circumference were also greater in the behavior therapy group than in the education group at both 3 months (P =.001) and 6 months (P =.005).  CONCLUSIONS: Participants who were given a structured behavioral treatment program with weekly contact and individualized feedback had better weight loss compared with those given links to educational Web sites. Thus, the Internet and e-mail appear to be viable methods for delivery of structured behavioral weight loss programs.     Patients' experience with a diabetes support programme based on an interactive electronic medical record: qualitative study.  (Ralston JD, Revere D, Robins LS, Goldberg HI.)  BMJ. 2004 May 15;328(7449):1159.   OBJECTIVE: To describe the experiences of patients with type 2 diabetes in a web based disease management programme based on an interactive electronic medical record.   DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews with patients enrolled in a diabetes care module that included access to their electronic medical record, secure email, ability to upload blood glucose readings, an education site with endorsed content, and an interactive online diary for entering exercise, diet, and medication.   SETTING: Patients' homes in Washington state, United States.   PARTICIPANTS: Nine participants aged 45-65 completed interviews before and after they used the programme.   RESULTS: Six themes emerged: feeling that non-acute concerns are uniquely valued; enhanced sense of security about health and health care; frustration with unmet expectations; feeling more able to manage; valuing feedback; and difficulty fitting the programme into activities of daily life. Three themes--valuing non-acute concerns, feeling secure, and unmet expectations--have particular relevance to the design and use of web based tools for care of patients with diabetes and chronic medical conditions.   CONCLUSION: Participants' experiences support further study of open access to the electronic medical record and online communication between patients and their care providers. The development of web based disease management programmes should take into account the specific needs and expectations of patients, and patients and providers should have candid discussions about what web based care can and cannot provide.     Evaluation of an internet-based physical activity intervention: a preliminary investigation.  (Napolitano MA, Fotheringham M, Tate D, Sciamanna C, Leslie E, Owen N, Bauman A, Marcus B.)  Ann Behav Med. 2003 Spring;25(2):92-9.   The Internet has the potential for delivering innovative, interactive physical activity (PA) interventions to large numbers of people. This study was designed to test the efficacy of an Internet intervention that consisted of a Web site plus 12 weekly e-mail tip sheets, compared with a waiting list control group. The Internet intervention was theory based and emphasized clear, graphical presentation of PA information. Sixty-five (30 intervention and 35 control) sedentary adult employees of several large hospitals (9 men and 56 women) were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 study arms. Of the 65 participants, 57 completed the 1-month follow-up, and 52 completed the 3-month follow-up. At both 1 and 3 months, those in the intervention group were significantly more likely to have progressed in stage of motivational readiness for PA than participants in the control group: 1 month, c2(1, N =52) =4.05, p      Web-based tailored nutrition education: results of a randomized controlled trial.  (Oenema A, Brug J, Lechner L.)  Health Educ Res. 2001 Dec;16(6):647-60.   There is ample evidence that printed, computer-tailored nutrition education is a more effective tool for motivating people to change to healthier diets than general nutrition education. New technology is now providing more advanced ways of delivering tailored messages, e.g. via the World Wide Web (WWW). Before disseminating a tailored intervention via the web, it is important to investigate the potential of web-based tailored nutrition education. The present study investigated the immediate impact of web-based computer-tailored nutrition education on personal awareness and intentions related to intake of fat, fruit and vegetables. A randomized controlled trial, with a pre-test-post-test control group design was conducted. Significant differences in awareness and intention to change were found between the intervention and control group at post-test. The tailored intervention was appreciated better, was rated as more personally relevant, and had more subjective impact on opinion and intentions to change than the general nutrition information. Computer literacy had no effect on these ratings. The results indicate that interactive, web-based computer-tailored nutrition education can lead to changes in determinants of behavior. Future research should be aimed at longer-term (behavioral) effects and the practicability of distributing tailored interventions via the WWW.     The diabetes network internet-based physical activity intervention: a randomized pilot study.  (McKay HG, King D, Eakin EG, Seeley JR, Glasgow RE.)  Diabetes Care. 2001 Aug;24(8):1328-34.   OBJECTIVE: Because of other competing priorities, physical activity (PA) is seldom addressed in a consistent way in either primary care or diabetes education. This 8-week pilot study evaluated the short-term benefits of an Internet-based supplement to usual care that focused on providing support for sedentary patients with type 2 diabetes to increase their PA levels.   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 78 type 2 diabetic patients (53% female, average age 52.3 years) were randomized to the Diabetes Network (D-Net) Active Lives PA Intervention or an Internet information-only condition. The intervention condition received goal-setting and personalized feedback, identified and developed strategies to overcome barriers, received and could post messages to an on-line "personal coach," and were invited to participate in peer group support areas. Key outcomes included minutes of PA per week and depressive symptomatology.   RESULTS: There was an overall moderate improvement in PA levels within both intervention and control conditions, but there was no significant improvement in regard to condition effects. There was substantial variability in both site use and outcomes within the intervention and control conditions. Internal analyses revealed that among intervention participants, those who used the site more regularly derived significantly greater benefits, whereas those in the control condition derived no similar benefits with increased program use.   CONCLUSIONS: Internet-based self-management interventions for PA and other regimen areas have great potential to enhance the care of diabetes and other chronic conditions. We conclude that greater attention should be focused on methods to sustain involvement with Internet-based intervention health promotion programs over time.
