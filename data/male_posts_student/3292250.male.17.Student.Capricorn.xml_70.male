If you haven't seen it, do so. The writing is briliant, and the cast is fabulous. My favorite of the fabulous four has to be, hands down, Kim Cattrall. She is just so hilarious as Samantha. But I really can't pick a fav because I love 'em all. Time to find Mom's Season 1 tapes somewhere in the mess of other archaic VHS tapes. DVD is just so much better, but alas, the house only this year jumped into the DVD world.
