I am sooooooo frickin' happy     Our Nation must defend the sanctity of marriage." -- you know who Actually, I happen to believe that our nation doesn't have any business defending the sanctity of anything except the freedom of religion itself. In other words, the government should get out of marriage altogether. If marriage is such an important part of religion to conservative Christians, then the government has no business regulating it in any way - neither forbidding nor allowing. Earthly law should be toothless in marriage and marriage should be toothless in Earthly law. So this is how we protect Bush's and others' vision of a sacred institution not to be trifled with: Confine it only to church. Allow the churches to marry whoever they want, and refuse anyone they don't. Allow the churches to make divorce impossible - because as everyone else has said ad nauseum, Britney Spears is doing more to ruin the sanctity of marriage than any gay man ever dreamed of. Meanwhile, we'll be over here doing the civil union thing.  Don't get me wrong, I think most churches, if not all, would require that there be a civil union to go along with the marriage, but if the synonymity of the two is actually causing our government to wring their hands about possibly going to the time and expense of passing a constitutional amendment   Remove marriage from civil unions, and the right-wingers can't complain about the sanctity of marriage. Remove civil unions from marriage, and the left-wingers can't complain about discrimination. God, jus' be nice to the gay men!    More Self Help Bullshit  I have now been asked to write down four things that motivate me by the previously mentioned work colleague... And by work I mean eductation 1.	My beloved - because everything I do I do for him, and without whom life would be meaningless. 2. Friends  Family - I don't want to let people down. 3. The Past - I have done things in the past that I am not proud of, and don't wish to make the same mistakes again. 4. Self Improvement - I want to get better at the things I do, and want to keep getting better.  Said colleague was confused that none of my driving forces were money. He could not understand why I was not driven by money. My reasons for this are quite simple really - money controls us and defines who we are. I dislike that.  When I do something I want it to be for the right reasons. I am not a materialistic person. I want experiences and things from life, which require money to achieve, but money is just a means to an end for me. Money is not the meaning of life, and never should be.  What amazes me are the lengths that coffee drinkers go to for coffee ... so I'm an avid coffee drinker ... when I need coffee, it doesnt matter if its the shittiest coffee I've ever had ... one time, when I was at a basketball game, someone offered to buy me coffee ... so I said yes ... he came back with black coffee - no cream or sugar ... I asked him where the cream and sugar were and he said they're at the stand ... rather than walking my ass up I decided to drink the black coffee ... I finished it instantly ... it was the most bitter coffee I've ever had ... yet I drank on ... funny how I drank the coffee even though I didnt like it ... or maybe ... whats even funnier is the fact that I couldn't get up and walk a measly 50 feet to get cream and sugar ... hmmm ... a thought for the day...
