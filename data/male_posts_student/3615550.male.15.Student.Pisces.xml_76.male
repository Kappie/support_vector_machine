Please ignore the liberal slant in the article I linked to; I thought it might be neat to see what the dems think about Bill's "tirade."  I wonder what happens to a conservative black man in Hollywood when he speaks out in such a way as Mr. Cosby has?  Cosby has said things that white compassionate conservatives have been saying for years, only they said it under their breath to avoid being labeled racist.  I am not a racist; if anyone believes that then he is in a dreamworld where Kerry is president.  I am someone who agrees with Bill Cosby.  I see behavioral problems in low-income black America (LIBA) which need to be fixed.  I also see behavioral problems in low-income white America, and high-income America.  The middle class has it's own set of problems.  All of these problems need to be fixed.    Unfortunately, every time someone tries to point out the quite obvious problems that bind LIBA, they are labeled as a "racist," and quickly ostracized.  I can't even say that all of LIBA has these problems, but all of LIBA has to deal with these problems.  The problems that they have are more common in LIBA than in other demographic groups; that is not debatable.  I could go on, but I think that "the Cos" has already said everything I would say, and he has said it better than I can anyway.  God bless Bill Cosby.
