I also dislike it when people break into quotations as I just did. Rest assured, this entry talks about cars.                I guess I'm pretty spoiled. I don't do any work around the house (often, I don't even make my bed until I get home from work); I don't really contribute anything to the household; my parents give me a lot of money--$100 a month, plus diesel costs, plus car insurance, plus car repairs, in total probably about $300 a month; and I'm often pretty unrespectful to my parents, to boot. This occured to me a few days ago when I was thinking about getting a MINI Cooper, or rather, accepting one as a gift from my mother. My dad was opposed to it (for non-financial reasons), and by implication said that I was spoiled.  Recognizing that I already have a perfectly functional 1984 Mercedes-Benz 300D Turbo Diesel, I tried to rationalize the purchase of a new MINI Cooper at a total price tag, including tax and all costs, of about $20,500, as follows in no particular order. First, my car lacks air conditioning and a functioning FM radio, and it would be stupid to put said amenities in because doing so would cost more than the value of the car.  Second, my car is somewhat unsafe as it does not have crumpmle zones, ABS, air bags, or traction control. This is something of a moot point because my car weighs like 6000 pounds, is made of steel, and doesn't accelerate very well, so I am unlikely to get into any serious accident, and even if I do I'll probably be doing a lot more damage than I'll be receiving. Third, the aforementioned poor acceleration sometimes makes it difficult for me to get onto freeways  I can go from 0 to 60 in about 18 seconds, which is generally sufficient for getting onto 280 but sometimes causes trouble for getting onto 101 when it's somewhat but not tremendously crowded. I don't go on the freeway very often, though. Fourth, my car is prone to breaking in various places as it is over 20 years old. Fifth, my car gets pretty bad gas mileage and does a lot of damage to the environment. It also has never passed a smog check. Sixth, the MINI Cooper has like a million air bags so it's very safe.  Seventh, the MINI Cooper has air conditioning and AM/FM radio and a totally unnecessary CD player. Eighth, the MINI Cooper would be stick shift which would be kind of cool to learn to drive.  Ninth, the MINI Cooper is reasonably environmentally friendly and gets fairly good gas mileage--27/36 or something like that. Tenth (principally a suggestion on my mom's part, though something I had embraced), lots of other high school students have expensive cars like new Solaras, Acuras, and BMWs.  When I talked to my dad about this, I realized how spoiled a brat I can be sometimes. I said, "Is it not unreasonable to want to drive a car that has air conditioning and FM radio?" It sounded reasonable at the time, but now this sentence seems representative of the decadence I live in. In a sample of people my age in the United States, most don't even have their own cars, and I'm whining about not having some unnecessary amenities in mine. I am loath to hold myself to relative standards, however, so I have compiled a fairly compelling argument behind why I should not accept the gift of a MINI Cooper from my mom.  I have already addressed the first point on the above list. The second point rebuts itself. The third point is weak--I can still get on the freeway, only it's a little more difficult. The fourth point is moot as I will be living at home next year, Mercedes-Benz has very good roadside assistance, and my parents are paying for repairs anyway. The fifth point stands but it's absurd to spend $20,500 to save a little money on fuel, and in any case we don't have to pay a fine for failing the smog check because my mom already paid it years ago (a sunk cost).   As for the sixth point, the MINI Cooper has only a very marginal at best safety advantage over my current car. The seventh point I have already addressed--I don't really need air conditioning and FM radio, so such things are unnecessary and actually are signs of decadence. The eighth point is decadence incarnate--"let's spend $20,500 to have fun!"   Regarding the ninth point, I ignore two things. First, it's not economical to spend $20,500 to slightly improve the environment and save a little on fuel; and second, 27/36 is pretty bad gas mileage considering that a new generation of hybrids and similar cars are going to come out in the coming decade.  And the tenth argument is moot on three levels: relativity, necessity, and economy.  On relativity: it is moot based on relative expense to other students at Gunn High School because buying a MINI Cooper would put me in the top 15% or so of students in terms of cost of car, showing how spoiled I am. I don't know any national norms but it's pretty much a given that buying your kid a new car is a sure sign of decadence and spoiled brattiness.  Yes, there are some students who drive new Hondas, new Camry Solaras, even new BMWs at Gunn, but for many of these students these vehicles were necessary first purchases to expand their families' vehicle fleets--their families happened to need another car, so they bought another one and let them drive them. Some of those students probably made a lot of money on their own and bought the cars with theor own money. Others are simply spoiled brats.  But in any situation one individual person or family's decision making process should not be impacted by another's, as the principles behind decision making are universal--that the Jones family purchases lots of unnecessary cars and spoils the kids doesn't somehow legitimize purchasing lots of unnecessary cars and spoiling the kids. On necessity: It is unecessary for me, a 17-year-old, to have a car. I could walk to school every day if really necessary, as I only live about 50 minutes away from school by walking. That I have a car is an incredible blessing and in and of itself perhaps somewhat spoiling, and definitely unhealthy, as I would surely be a lot more healthy if I walked to and from school every day. On economy: It is uneconomical to spend $20,500 buying a new car for a 17-year-old who has no need for a car at all. Very, very few 17-year-olds have contributed $20,500 gross (not even net!) to their families. I definitely haven't. One can do a lot of good with $20,500 by giving a consummate sum to charity. Also, speculation went that if I got a MINI Cooper, we would sell one of the other family cars, meaning that we would actually lose utility in our vehicle fleet as the MINI Cooper is not as good a vehicle for a family.  If I really examine the reasons why I want to accept a gift from my mother of a MINI Cooper, I recognize that my reasons are wholly decadent, unnecessary, and perhaps even representative of a greater fiscal depravity. I principally want a MINI Cooper because the vehicle is glamorous, fun to drive, and generally better than my current car; I am not motivated by any real needs.   Indeed, the reason my mom wants to buy me a MINI Cooper is well-intentioned but misguided: she wants to buy me a MINI Cooper as a reward for my doing well in school and on standardized tests. She sees it as a kind of motivating factor (aside from going to college while conveniently ignoring the fact that whenever I do well she tends to give me money). God has given me a gift of intelligence, and I shouldn't be rewarded for doing well in something that my personal integrity had nothing to do with. Besides, it just sounds spoiled that I'm getting a new car for doing well in school when tens of thousands of other students have done well in school as a matter of expectation. I suppose this is the greatest sign of my decadence; I'm spoiled but I don't want to appear spoiled to others.  I also have an ATM card that can be used as a credit card. Another sure sign of being spoiled is having a credit card-like item.  I also have a cell phone that I don't pay for.
