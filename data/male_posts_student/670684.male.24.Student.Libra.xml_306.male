Folks love to hack UT's websphere, and without any semblance of internet at the casa, I'm tapping out on the blog this afternoon.    House is fantastic.  A garage, a garage with speakers hooked up to play music outside, a garage with stereo equipment left over to allow music to be played on the speakers hooked up to play music outside, several knicknacks from the late 1980s, a cock and balls, horseshoes, a threshold, a make-out bench...all for $380 a month and a lot of painting to do.  The damage to the place is only cosmetic.  The first party was last night, and I ended up awake until 4, my longest sojurn of the summer.  Cool folks that new roomie Evan hangs out with, especially a sexy playwright who even made an operetta regarding children's literature and  Puss and Boots   fascinating.  I have a thing against Puss and Boots.  No clue why...but that cat on the cover of the book looks like a cross between an extra in Michael Jackson's  Thriller  and a pet with a severe hemmhroid problem.    Money sucks.
