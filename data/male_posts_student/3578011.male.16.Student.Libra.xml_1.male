Today will be a nice exception. Mr. Smith is the new president of Geneva college and he has a family of a lot of kids, he starts his job as pres. Tomorrow. after we get back I'm going to have to pack super fast for pine valley because staff training starts at 5!!!!! yay! I can't wait!  we have tons of new guys working there on the crew and I guess I'll meet the new counselors if we have any, we got most of them back for this summer. so that means I won't be posting on me blog til next Friday night or Saturday depending if we go to ghost riders or not.  So I guess I'll talk to you all then! I'll get the mailing address for the camp so you can send me letters and I can write back! So we can stay in touch. Well be praying for myself and the camp as a whole this summer, it will  be appreciated. peace out and keep it real brothers and sisters in christ i'll miss yall love you all Clinton Bettner
