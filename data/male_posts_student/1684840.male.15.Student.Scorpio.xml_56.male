Didn't do anything really interesting at school today other than forget my Games note and had to go back home to fetch it at dinnertime.  We were using microscopes in Science and Chris put some of his blood on a slide to look through.  It was pretty cool but Miss. Jari told him off lol!  Well, it was much more fun than looking at onion peel >:D  I printed my story off last night so I can error check it when I have a bit of spare time.  Plus, it gives me another chance to read through it and convince myself it's not crap lol.  My stoopid printer is telling my I need to change the black ink cartridge because my stoopid printer uses cartridges with chips in, even though there is a lot of black ink left >:(  Just another money schemeing way Epson can make people buy their cartridges which cost a fortune grrrr.
