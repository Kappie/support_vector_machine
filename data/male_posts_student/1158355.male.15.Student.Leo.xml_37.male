After everyone got home from school, I played with Pat, Eric and Jim and then went to Keith's. We threw snowballs at Mike Chen's house and Donyall aka MR. HOLEEM. Shit, that Islam food kicks ass! We went to Sports Plus and played Lasertron. I was on a team with a bunch of awesome little pack of black boys that kept holding the gun to my head sideways (G STYLE). One little kid's eyes were glowing. Forget that, Jess M's teeth were glowing! So... we lost but we tried. It was me, Mike W, Jess M and the little boys vs Crystal F, Keith B, Michelle F and John D with some tall guy who knew what he was doing so obviously that's why we lost. So, we told the little kids to get the boy with the red shirt ( John D)  Sure enough, the little boys beat the crap out of John and John got penalized! I also smashed into Jess on a corner. After Lasertron we went skating. Ok, I haven't skated since I got 50 stitches in my chin in 6th grade. First I fell back on my head and flew foward landing on my chin. They had to close the rink because of the blood... sorry too much detail. So, I faced my worst fear and started running out there, not skating, running and every time Crystal would push me I'd freak out like a little girl. I saw Justin S there so I was all good. wERd. He helped me tie my shoes and Justin and I met up with two girls, Krystal and Dorothy (cousins) who knew Justin. Those girls must of thought I was crazy flopping around on the ice but it was funny because I'd go up to random girls and start dancing with them. I got two of the Sports Plus girls on the ice to fall on the ground laughing because I passed them rubbing my chest and stuff... ya know. Today I went to my cousin's for my cousin's 11th birthday and that's it. Came home. Bye.
