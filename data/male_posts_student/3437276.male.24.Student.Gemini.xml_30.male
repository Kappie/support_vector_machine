First of all, I figure that we (Japan-TV) might get around to subtitling it, if I can convince a team to take it on. But more than that, I had previously seen the first fewepisodes with English subs,andthe rest of the series was never similarlyreleased. Ireally wanted toknow how the thing ended, soI bought the DVDs.  I knew going into it that I wouldn't be able to understand the dialoge, but I assumed that, armedwith a basic understanding of the plot, I'd be able to gleam enough from tone, facial expressions, and body language to follow around.I haven't finished the show yet, but things have been working outwell enough, considering thecircumstances. There have been a few developments that I haven't been 100% clear on, but all-in-all I feel pretty good about the experience. I even discovered that I understood more Japanese than I thought I did.  Many people would findwatching a show in a language they didn't understand a frustrating experience, but I'mpretty used to it. When I wasyounger I used to watch Chinese shows with relatives, and they didn't have English subtitles and I don't understand Mandarin or Cantonese. I actually had a pretty good time.You cangleam a lot, even without understanding the words, and withsome imagination you can even work out some kind of plot.  Anyway, if anyone gets a chance to check out Tokyo Love Story, preferably in a language they can understand, I recommend it.
