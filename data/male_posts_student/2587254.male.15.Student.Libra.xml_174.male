Not that I'm pissed at that in fact I can't wait to go into gr. 11. being a senior next year, as mentioned by Gloria "WE'RE GETTING OLD!" haha and also the senior music trip.......always awesome =). So yeah...final days of gr. 10 are spent cramming for bio and math. Great eh =P.  Well my day started at the usual 730. It's kinda funny to think I used to leave my house at 730 back in early grade 9. Heh now I wake up then, and then get to school by 810. Well gave Patrick a lift also, and we got to school as I said by 810. I had to photocopy my solo for Mrs. Wharton, and then after that rushed downstairs to do what rehearsal I could.  Before I knew it the last music class of the year begun =(. Oh well...did my solo. I was 4th. I got a 89 for it...not bad. I was expectin sometin worse...but 89 is good I guess lol. I'm volunteering to help clean up after bio exam on June 15th, hmm and yeah we also got rice krispie squares =P. Mmmm.....food ^_^.  So science basically we did nothing. No notes, just talked and stuff. John got "Penis John" written on his back by Nick Saika who was "just" writing John haha. Hangman was a popular game...7 up died after 2 rounds lol. Hmm.....dunno what else happened. Today was pretty relaxing...nothing to do at all. Lunch came and I went to study w/ Hammond for bio.  Lunch yeah we studied. Hmm.....yeah Hammond needs some work on biology. I do also...but I knew more than him hehe. I need to learn more taxonomy...and stuff. And DNA...yeah I need to relearn that. So far biochem and the systems i've conquered =P.  Bio.studied. And somehow we began to talk about movies lol. Underhill, Drew and Okanski were in their own group, and somehow me, Robert, Melissa, Tehm, Rachel, and Lilian began talking about movies also lol. Lily gave us some fortune cookies...mmm cookies ^_^ and then we kept on talking about movies. We all agreed Dodgeball looks funny and Texas Chainsaw Massacre *though I've yet to see it* is retarded. Just hearing about the crappy slasher film makes me not wanna see it hehe. Oh yeah Tehmina was talking about some part in the Ring about the horse falling off a cliff...yeah she said she was as MSN lazy people say "lmao." I'm really lazy so yeah...and also this points out how the english language has been butchered. Totally off subject but I thought I'd point it out =P.  English...FREE MEAL! We had our cafe today...so basically I got a lunch for free =P. Watched a bit of some movie "Ms. Dodgefire" or sometin. Pretty funny. Robin Williams is in it. I wanna see the rest of it =P.  After school went to study for math a bit w/ Steve, then headed for home.  Yeah....that was pretty much my last day two of the year. I'm not going to school on Monday since it's redundant. Argh well until Ms. Wiener said we get to see our marks Monday. So I may just drop in Monday for bio and then leave again lol.  Anyways I'm out for now. Later.
