Well, I'm going to definately work on some stuff for the novel tonight. Hope to get alot done. I'm seeing Spiderman 2 tomorrow with some friends...Trey, Dana, and Droo. I already read the book, so I already know what happens, but I'm still dying to see it.  Also, the ESSIGS left for columbus today to see family. Daniel hitched a ride with them too...so I have the room to myself. Gee, I already miss him.  I really feel like writing stuff about my novel idea on here, but alot of it has to just be stuffed together menatally. I don't know...I keep having different ideas...I thinjk I should write them all down and compare them sometimes...  Oh, yeah. the first Silence Effect fan site was created yesterday by Joey Squire. Its really cool. check it out at... www.freewebs.com/sefan Yeah, its pretty sweet...  Well, gotta run. Keep rockin...
