Always one to hunt out cute clothes or accesories at bargain prices, I gave Wal-Mart's Vision Center a try. After all, I did get my current ones there (as for my first pair almost 7 years ago, I don't remember how I got them, except for the underlying 'mo in me didn't say "NO FOOL! They're ugly and big and don't match your face!"... 2 years later I corrected the issue. And today I got myself 2 new pairs. The first are normal glasses. The frames are black, and thicker than the wire ones I have now, and only surround half the lens. This picture either is or is 99% the frame I chose:       The other frame is for my new prescription sunglasses, since I'll be driving and such. They look sorta like my current ones, but silver and more round/eliptical (less boxy at the bottom). I don't have a pic of them, but I'll get some of me wearing both pairs as soon as I can using whatever photographic means I have access to.
