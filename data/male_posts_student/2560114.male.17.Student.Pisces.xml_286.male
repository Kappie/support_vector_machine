I mean its silly how ppl can get offended when someone calls them a "girly-man". Here, ill jus perform a dialogue about this childish insult on some random person...here we go...  Arnold: You know what!?!...u r a "girrrly-man" Bill: OMG!...DID U JUST CALL ME A "GIRLY-MAN"!?! Arnold: Yes...I did...SO WATCHU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT!?! Bill:...I'm jus gonna cry cuz those was the most hurtful words that i have ever heard in my life! (Bill Starts to Cry) Bill: I DEMAND AN APOLOGY!  and scene...  come on folkz...i mean "poo poo head" is a better insult than girly man in my opinion...ppl these dayz...can't take the little thingz that come at them...i mean these ppl r adults and all they do is jus get offended by creative insults by our governor...yes, i said creative as a form of sarcasm...if u don't know what sarcasm is...then u should go to school more often...so for all of the ppl that were offended by arnold's comments...go fuck urself...payce   now u see what happenz when im bored...foolz
