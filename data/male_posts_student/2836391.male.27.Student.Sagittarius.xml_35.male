I added a guitar, since my latest project is teaching myself to play. I started to learn at College, but I was finding this hard, given that it was a group learning situation. So, I have bought a teach yourself to play book, and I am working through it, with some success.  Another visit to the old home town over the weekend. A very enjoyable time, catching up with friends, plus a visit to my parents, who again had a list of questions about their computer for me to answer.  I'm almost at the end of the semester, and I'm really looking forward to the holiday, and the lighter timetable that I will have next semester.
