I decided to try the whole process again when I saw a friends blog on this site. It looked cooler and more "user-friendly," plus since it was different it wouldn't be as cliche (I hate that word  SO  much).    This blog will be nothing special. Well, I can't guarantee that -- especially if you think I'm something special. But then you'd definetily be in the minority and you should find a really good therapist or just a sharp knife to slit your ... well lets not go there.    I leave you today (maybe not -- I might write again!) with a thought from : "When in Rome." And when you're not in Rome, well you're definitly screwed there. Have a nice time with my blog!
