It is really disgusting people.  What makes anything scarrier on the 31st than it is on the 29th.  I am not in a New York state of mind,  I am in a morbid, hellish state of mind.  Where did that come from?  I am feeling very restless because no one is coming into work and I am reallly rather bored.  Wait I think someone is here...nope.  I feel like smashing something like a big ole pumpkin.  Of course, it would have to be my pumpkin because I wouldn't want to smash something someone had put work into,  that is just plain mean.  I want to drop it from the top of a building.  I need a pumpkin.  I could also use a tall building.  I am ready for Christmas.  I know, I know everyone is in a really good mood then too but it is ok because I get presents.  There is absolutely nothing on daytime tv.  Good lord this place is disorganized.  I feel like cleaning it but I can't.  I don't know what I could throw away.  My boss is in Scotland, I wish I were there.  Is Halloween an international holiday?  What about Valentine's Day,  maybe they just celebrate it at a different time in Europe?  It is gloomy in Scotland because it often rains.       I like the rain, as long as it gets stuff wet, good and soaked.  I hate it when the rain falls but then not so much as the concrete is damp.  Do de do de do.  Motown is awesome.  My dad used a deragatory racial slur toward Germans.  Then we got into this big discussion about how you can't say stuff like that, especially in public.  He then tried to convince me that "niger" isn't a bad word as long as you use it when refering to the color and not the race.  He then proceeded to use it in multiple sentences while we are sitting in a restaurant.  People were starring.  He also referred to himself as a "cracker".   I was laughing so hard I thought I was going to pee my pants.  He told my mother that she was a , well, a slur toward Italians.  I think his life probably flashed before his eyes.   My mother has a wonderful gift, as do most women, of making you feel extremely guilt by doing nothing at all.  Subject for a later date.  I apologize for the rambling.
