I'm so excited! Jesus just keeps opening doors for me to get me to where He wants me to be.  I should tell you since I haven't put it in yet, but God has placed a calling on my life to be a Minister of Music. So you know I'm doing everything I can to learn about music and just learning how to be a faithful servant.  Anyway I started working on a song that I haven't worked on in a while. If I ever get it finished and get it copyrighted I'll post the lyrics. But you know since it's not legally mine, if I posted it and someone decided it to make it their's then you know they could get away with it. So for now you'll just have to wait.  I do have 25% songwriter credit on one song though. It's called "True Love Waits". Very cool song.  But anyway I just wanted to write something since I didn't write yesterday.  Someone send me an e-mail! My Inbox is kind of empty!
