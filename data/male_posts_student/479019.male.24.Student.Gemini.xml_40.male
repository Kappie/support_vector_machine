It's been a productive day. Sure I didn't get exactly what I wanted, but I found out that Quigley one of the the Catholic dudes behind the Hays code had his paper the  Motion Picture Hearld  amongst other Catholic papers just trash  Blockade . It's also interesting that IATSE projectionists didn't want to show the movie do to the politics. This is great stuff! I typed up a bunch of my research notes from today, which is a good thing. In a few days I won't be able to read my writing.  Ok off to bed!  ***
