Long ahead the road still lies No light to greet my tear-filled eyes…  (Chorus) Love I seek, yet not have found Can it ever be? Anyone for me? Can it ever be? My heart cries within the ground.  I want it to be, I for you Only works if you love me too How I long, for my heart to give That for each other, we may live.  Never has anyone loved me I hurt so bad, can’t you see? My love I could truly show,  But still they turn and they tell me no.  (Bridge) My heart is in agony I can’t see through my tears Why won’t they reach out to me? Do they not care?  This one's old, written a few months shy of a year ago.
