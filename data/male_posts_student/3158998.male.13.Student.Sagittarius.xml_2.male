He say I eat sweets, it is just a piece of chicken that is still in my mouth only. 3. He call me to shut up duing the class committee meeting during recess, like i am outsiders. 4. He la, call the whole class to walk a big round from the music room to the lab then to the classroom just because miss tong didn't come. 5. He made me walk from his place to my place to take a cloth and a exercise book 2 times and walk to his place AGAIN! (In the classroom) After school, we stay in the classroom to clean up the class and something happened to Elliot. Poor thing ... ... ... ... ...
