This is why I wonder why you hate me so much, why you roll your eyes whenever you happen to "overhear" one of my conversations, and why you test my objectivity so damn much... so damn, damn much...  You happen to like Hero. Fine, I respect that. But still, this does not give you the right to viciously assault me, a casual fan of Sandara Park. I really don't see the point in all of it; they just entertain me is all. So what if I really feel Sandy should have won? So what if I lost some cash betting on her to win in the finals? So what if your idol beat her? This shouldn't really be the cause of any hate amongst our houses...  Aw crap, screw it! How could you? How could any of you even lay eyes on this guy? Are you not aware that your idol is nothing more than a no-talent camera whore?! And where does he get off beating Sandara, my dear, sweet, beloved Sandara?  I don't understand it! How could that guy win? I always thought Philippine showbiz was based purely on looks. I mean, geez, Heart Evangelista?! Haller??!? Sandara is way, WAY more attractive than Hero will EVER be!!! You people are frickin' blind! (either that or you're frickin' gay)  Oh right, he's got "talent." Well if this so-called "talent" was so damn important, what happens when this starts to decline? And did it ever occur to you that talent can be obtained through practice? Did you ever think of that?! Did you ever consider that maybe, just maybe, Hero's talent is already at its highest point and Sandara's is yet to be discovered only to greatly surpass that of the former? Didn't think of that did ya Eisenstein?  What, do you think he's so damn smart cause he studies in UP? Two words people: talent test. Think about it: would it be fair to you, the ugly-talentless-intellectual, for someone like that to have looks, "talent," AND brains?! No frickin' way man! Someone upstairs musta DEFINITELY screwed up if that were the case. At least Sandara doesn't "pretend" to be smarter than she is. She keeps it real; Hero is a poser. (I bet the televised version of his life story was nothing more than a gross exaggeration of a normal middle class lifestyle)  And all you peyupsters who gush at the sound of his name, would you all please stop? I am damn sick and tired of hearing you blab away on the toki about how you almost met this guy at the OUR who kinda-maybe-sorta looks like him, or how you treat his classmates like friggin' rock stars just because they've actually talked to him, or how you mob Bartlett Hall everyday so you can beg and plead for an autograph. He doesn't care! He's a "star" now! All that matters now is the money and the fame! So what if you stop worshipping the ground he steps on? He's got a million more lunatics where you came from. To him, you are nothing more than an expendable resource.  He is so unlike my beloved... She's perfect, absolutely perfect. That smile, those eyes, that hair... Ahihihi! Oh my sweet, sweet Sandara... I read somewhere that if I answered that friendster quiz right and sent it to thirteen people I get to meet you in two weeks and we would fall in love and get married. Only two days left now my pet... Soon, soon, we will be together, and then, then...  Don't you dare criticize me, hypocrite! What, you say I only love her for her looks?! So what?!?? At least I have the balls to admit that! Why do YOU like Hero anyway? Is it because of his "talent"? His "intellect"? His "great personality"? Hah! Don't make me laugh!  But then, nothing will change. You lower forms of life will always feel the same way, and I can't do anything about that. Take my advice though: get a life. FAST. God knows you need it. But I know you wouldn't do that... why do I even bother...   While I would love to keep telling you how much of a loser you are, I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me. My Sandara shrine could use some more incense...   Disclaimer: The following work is pure fiction. The thoughts presented here do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the author. Truth be told, I don't think I even deserve an opinion, for I have not seen a single episode of SCQ nor would I be caught dead watching one.   completely wrong thought of the day: walang maisip... it's not really "wrong," but it's too short for an actual entry, so here we go... The Incubus Fancore hater- has never heard of/despises them. hates Brandon Boyd and claims to be more attractive than he ever will be. often overdoses on hallucinogens. non-fan- the name of the band seems vaguely familiar to them. hums "Are you in?" or "Wish you were here" but has no idea who sang them. thinks that guy with the long hair is cute. the raving lunatic- has no idea that Incubus plays music. thinks Brandon Boyd is a hottie. the slightly below average fan- listens to "Morning View" and "Crow Left of the Murder". likes the music, but has never bought a CD. only listens to them on MTV and on the radio at times. thinks Brandon Boyd is kewl. the fan (period)- listens to their music from "Make Yourself" up. has actual likes and dislikes regarding the music. doesn't necessarily worship the frontman; it could be that the fan likes the guitarist or the DJ, or even the drummer, but all solely based on the music. looked up Incubus in the dictionary or asked Triggerman on infopop what it meant. hardcore- has known what an Incubus is even before hearing of the band. liked them as an underground band. likes "Fungus Amongus" and "S.C.I.E.N.C.E." more than the newer albums, which he or she claims to be more catered to mainstream tastes. thinks people who do not measure up as well in terms of "hardcore"-ness are all posers. likes the band as a whole. looks exactly like Brandon Boyd.
