In my continuing battle to avoid doing anything productive, I actually went to a bunch of the websites mentioned in the sidebar, curious as to how there could be 40 different kinds of bacon, what exactly the Bacon-of-the-Month club can get away with charging, and whether there's a store near me that sells the center-cut low-fat bacon the article makes sound awfully enticing.  Not that I'm going to go buy bacon in a supermarket (I think I have to turn in my Jewish Membership Card if I do that), but just because reading about bacon is more interesting than reading about the winner of a battle for priority between statutory lienors and secured lenders (but just barely).
