But I will say this: I am not allowed to do any strenuous exercise for about a month after my symptoms start to dwindle. As my symptoms will be here for at least a few more days (weeks?), it will be a while before I can hit any 9s or 10s at the gym.  The  good  news is that when they took my tests at the doctor, they learned that my blood pressure is 110/68 and my cholesterol is 119! Perhaps the mono lowered that just a bit, but that is still really good. This proves that I am healthy.  :-)  This, despite eating fast food all last week!
