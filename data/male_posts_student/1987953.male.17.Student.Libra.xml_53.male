So doesn't that mean I'm not a victim? Oh well.  Either way, my girlfriend Brittany decided last night to temporarily (with an option of permanent) take a break from each other because we have been quarrelling too much in the past several weeks and all kinds of small problems. I have caused the majority of this. So though we will be keeping in touch over E-mail a little, we will lose contact until she is ready to call me again, which shouldn't be too long, since she will need more of a break than I will. I am optimistic that she and I will come to the decision together that we do belong together, but in the meantime, that optimistic outlook just makes it worse. If we do NOT get back together, we will always be very close as good friends and just understand that we have others out there better for us.  Brittany, if you're reading this right now, I can't think of anybody on earth better for me than you and I love you so much. Wherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you. I'm waiting for this nightmare to end. You know the number. But whatever you choose will be okay. I love you, and I'm praying you make the best decision despite my very opinionated hope. I have no doubt in my mind that you and I belong together, at least for now, if not forever. But whatever you decide is great. I love you so much!  Anyway, that's all for now! Leave me something until tomorrow's blog. Blog you later!
