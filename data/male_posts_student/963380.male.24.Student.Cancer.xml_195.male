However, today I used the words "and that's my final decision" - that coupled with the rather austere look the suit provides, well, I just didn't get questioned. I miss suits.  I'm hungry a lot. Not down and out ravenous, just snack hungry. It's the worst kind of hunger because you know it's just there because you're used to it.  I bought the old Mario and the old Zelda for GBA today. yay.
