And when I'm done that will leave only The Last Hero that I haven't read, not counting A Hat Full of Sky, which I don't think is out this side of the pond yet. And, just as a heads up, the next DW book will be called Going Postal and it's coming out in October or November. It's about the postal system and golems. That's all I've been able to get. I think it's another misc. with cameos, like Monstrous Regiment was.  I have now listened to the Two Towers tapes, and if you want a few highlights, check out my journal. If you don't have its address, just let me know and I'll email it to you, since I don't think blogger will let me put the link up here.   Yesterday I went to the doctor to get vaccinated so that I can go to college. So I got a meningitis vaccine and a TB test. Yay. Then it turns out I have an enlarged thyroid gland, and I don't really know what that means, but they had to draw blood to test. I've never had that done before; it was kinda creepy. Then I have to go in again tomorrow so they can ultrasound my neck, I guess, and try to figure out why my thyroid is enlarged. I'm a little worried about it, I can tell you... Well, anyway. Just thought I'd put that out there so everybody can say, "Don't be worried, Erin, it's okay."   Later.  I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!
