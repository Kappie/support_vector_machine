At least with the horrific soul-deadening experience of school, you're doing something. Now all I do is think too much about stuff and people, and then mope about.  Anyway, expect some new material on Swashagunga's Realm soon, I feel a big ball of contempt climbing up my throat. If you didn't know, the link is over there under the heading that says "LINKS".  Ciao bambinos.
