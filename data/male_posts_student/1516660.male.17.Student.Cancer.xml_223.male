The 'ghost tribe' of castaways Survivor came back to vie for positions back into the game! They called themselves the Outcasts! I fully supported the OutCasts man! In the end, they won you know!! Coolies! The Drake had to kick Shawn out, becuase they saw him less of a threat than Jon. Morgan...surprise surprise! No voting! First time in Survivor History, did a Survivor surrendered and got his torch extinguished without a vote! Oh my my!!    Yes yes! Topday's a meowing Sat. Woke up at 8 something, took a bath, went online, ate breakfast and watched cartoons. Meow!! I ate lunch at 12.30.  You know what?!! The Sims: Making Magic is out!!! Oh my god!! The Sims can make magic!!! I have been waiting for this moment!!! Meow meow meow!!! However, I need Superstar to install Making Magic. I want all the expansion packs ma....must install in order you know. Parents say they would buy for me next week! Wee....or not. Cannot play!!! Must study!! Cannot install!! So torturous.  Okay...I went to Wendy's house to study SS and Physics. WQ went along too. I told him to meet at the busstop when he arrives. I went up to Wendy's house first. We chit-chatted, then WQ smsed me to go down.  The idiot!! Called me when he's still in the bus! Made me so mad. I thought of letting Lassie bite him. Meow meow! And he's so apprehensive. Walked so slow behind. When he heard Lassir barking at us as we approach Wendy's house, he got scared. Silly cat!! He made Wendy hold Lassie when he comes in, and refused to go near Lassie. Ayiah! Must let the dog familiarise your smell ma! Cute dog!   We studied today! I completed my Physics and Social Studies revision! Finally!! Meow meow!! I noticed that me and Wendy talked less often today. Felt weird. Actually, I expected that. A 'stranger' venutring into 'our terrority'. I felt that WQ felt left out lor, coz me and Wendy were like trying to talk about topics that are kinda sensitive. Meow meow!!  After studying, Wendy cooked instant noodles for us. As usual, I sweated a lot. Meow!! They said I am not like any normal human being! Meow meow!! Wendy's mother said "good what!". HaHa!! After eating, we studied further. After studying leh, I went on to write a letter to Bright. Yeah la. Write to him, say my last words.  At 5.45, I went off. The sky is extremely dark! And I am very stupid. I shoulda walked. I could get home in 10 minutes. But no!! I took the bus. And ended up waiting for 15 minutes for the bus. I am so kicking myself for this!  I came back to an empty house. It looks like my father went with my brtoher to redeem his 8250 handphone my brother won in the arcade. Anyway, took a bath, watched TV and ate dinner. After that, came online lor.  I gotta be going le. See you tomorrow. Night blog!
