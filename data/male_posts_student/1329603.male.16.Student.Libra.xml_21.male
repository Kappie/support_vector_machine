Admitedly I sprinted the very last bit but I still won, so nyah. Who says walking doesn't pay off? Meh, it's because of Cheltenham vs. Cambridge today. GO CHELTENHAM! >> Saw Sam on her way out of town, was tastefully ignored... she was with Tobin (or Toby I'm not sure), the guitarist for the band founded by Tom. I felt it would have been indecent to ask him what piece he'd prepared. Sam would've killed me. But they were having a debate, so go them. >> Saw a large group of people, including Dave Slaughter, Nick, Mellon and Harry, walking past Virgin. Go them. >> Bought a pair of 'Gentleman's combs'. I've been meaning to get one for a while and opportunity knocked... so go it. >> Noticed that this computer has a webcam. Woo. Go Information Center @ Beechwood Arcade. >> Wondering whether Sam's heard the news. If she hasn't... it'll be a shock tomorrow, put it like that.  John, we'll miss you.  Love, Jon Roskilly
