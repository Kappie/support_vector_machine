Now I know why people don't like me :- Why does everyone hate everyone else so much anyway???  Seriously, it's not like anyone means it...we're gonna get over it in a day or two anyway, and we'll just look back sumday and laugh.  "Boy I sure was dumb for thinkin' blah blah blah."  The Drive-In was pretty fun. I spent almost all of Prisoner of Azkaban talking to Tina about Cobian.  That wasn't TOO bad.  She was hurting pretty bad, and I like to make people feel better, so, I did what I could, which probably wasn't enough...and I had seen the movie once before, and wasn't THAT impressed, everything after LOTR just hasn't been that great to me.....I gotta stop comparing things to eachother....otherwise I'll always be dissappointed most likely.  Watched Mean Girls, that was a great movie.....mmm....girls*drool*  Sat by myself for most of that wrapped in a blanket with my twizzlers.  After that was over it was about 2 A.M. and we were debating whether to leave or not...and we finalyl decided to after sum friends* of Meekers came over and started "partying."  *I know, I didn't know he had friends either!* Got home and went to sleep.  Spent most of today with no Gamecube or XBOX....just my PS2 and computer.  Then when I went to get it, Ervin wasn't home, so Steve and I went to the High School to get the keys from him...we barely got them without suffering pain of death.  Got BACK to Ervin's house and his mom was home now...so the keys were useless.  Got my stuff and then headed back to the High School.  Steve walked in during practice and lots of people yelled at him..it was funny.  Looked for Keli in the room, didn't see her.  Talked to Tina in the hall for a few seconds though.  Then went and returned FFCC to Blockbuster...late.*DAMN YOU ERVIN!!!!*  And ate at McDonalds...restaurant, not the people who host DDR parties. Got home and came to Steve's..and that's where i currently reside.  Just talked to Cobian about a dream he had that sounded pretty sweet.  I don't have dreams anymore.  I remember when I had lots of dreams.  Those are just shattered memories now...  Memories scare me...more than anything in this world or the next.  Memories will destroy me.  You just watch and see. Peace!  Spense
