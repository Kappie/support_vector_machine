I fell asleep like 5 times. Then we went to Garlic Brothers for lunch, where my mom just bitched about everything. Do I really have to spend three more years with these people?  After that, I was looking forward to an afternoon of Xbox, and naps. But no, my aunt calls and said she bought tickets for me, and my brother, and my cousins to see Harry Potter. I didnt want to do that, but hey according to my dad, I should hang out with my family, because they're all I got, or some bull. Anyways, I show up at the movie theater and see people dressed as Harry Potter. Now, come on I understand liking things, but I never dress up as Master Chief everytime I play Halo. But wait, it gets worse. As if having to go and see this movie was enough torture, I had people behind me who were like complaining because things didnt go exactly as they went in the book. Alright typing this vented some of my anger, I'm a little better now.
