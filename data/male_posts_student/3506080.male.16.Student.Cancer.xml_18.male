Her mom then walks in, and Jessi tells me they found a house in town. Her dad can drop us off at the movies tomorrow, and we can still go on our date. Everything turned out right, which is kinda freakin' me out. Nothing normally turns out right. But, on the bright side, I kicked ass on Halo today. Juggernaut mode, I won 10-6.
