We picked elsa up on the way and went to millenia tower, don't really know how to spell. The office was of high technology and security was very tight. Everything was neat and clean, and the televisions were all flat screen. Then, we went on to study for the next 5 hours until 2, and went for lunch after that. After walking to suntec city and deciding for a long time, we decided to hav buffet at a restaurant called Kuali. The food wasn't that bad, and since it was buffet, i was gorging myself. As er jie had a dinner appointment at 1830, we had nowhere to go but home, so i went to my cousin house to slack. well, my stomach was already in some disorder, but carry on with cycling and further eating dinner when his father bought food home. I was trying very hard to gorge the food down as i almost couldn't take it. After that went to his neighbour house to watch soccer, and was already feeling the after effects of eating too much. After the Tottenham VS Liverpool game which ended in a draw, i then went home, which is around the time now. Stomach is still quite screwed and hope would get better later, gonna take some rest now, so cya...
