Then, I said, "Sure, whatever, go for it, [under breath] retard [/under breath]." So, Alec stuck the dime in his nose. A few minutes later, I hear Alec making a weird sound; it sounded kind of like the dog in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, when it was under the table and choking on a bone. Then, Alec raised his hand and said while crying, "Teacher, can I go to the nurse, I have a dime stuck in my nose." The teacher then said, "Sure, but why is there a dime in your nose?" Alec didn't respond, he just ran out of the room crying while the enitre class laughed at him. He came back about 10 minutes later and he was holding a plastic bag. I said, "Hey Alec, whats in the bag?" Alec said, "Oh, thats the dime, the nurse pulled it out with some tweezers, and gave it to me." All I did was shake my head in disgust! Ahh, good times, good times. Anyways, Alec was a retard then, and he is even worse now, because now he is a stoner. Before, he was just retarded. Now, he is a a super high retard man. What a faggot! Anyways, I have to go to sleep because it is getting late and the effects of my energy drink is wearing off.  later, bradleyJ
