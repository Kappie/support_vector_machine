Im in one of those moods again, for no reason at all either, i just feel depressed and like no one wants me around. these kind of moods just make me want to go back to bed and spend the rest of my life there, they suck. i dont understand, though, why i am in a shitty mood now when i was all hyper and having a great time talking to some friends last night? its like i slept on the wrong side of the bed... idk ill get through it though, i think its a certain someone that made me feel like this but i wont mention names right now, just give me a while and i'll tell you all about it! im waiting to hear from melissa i wonder what she has been up 2? lol well thats it for now...
