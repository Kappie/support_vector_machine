Board of Education National Historic Site with my history teacher and three classmates. Basically, Monroe Elementary School in Topeka has been renovated and converted into a museum to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, which declared that segregation of public schools is unequal and unconstitutional.  The site was dedicated by remarks from about twenty dignitaries, ranging from senators to NAACP officials. The prominent attendee was none other than the president himself, George W. Bush. When I told my family about this event a couple of weeks ago, they instantly began saying that I was going to meet the president, but that was not the case. In fact, I was about 200 feet from the podium, so I was nowhere near him.   Despite being so far away, and having to stand in the blistering heat surrounded by 4,000 people for several hours, it was still a great experience. I took some good, but far off, photos of the president, Air Force One, and Secret Service agents (which I will try to post tomorrow), and I was able to hear some great speakers.  The odd thing about today was that I didn't even get to go inside of the school, but hopefully I will be able to go back to Topeka this summer to look around. Anyway, I had to get up at 4:30 this morning to make the trip to Topeka, so I'm going to bed now.
