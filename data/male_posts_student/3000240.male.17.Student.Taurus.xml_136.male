However the Covent Gardenesque area is quite contemporary and most definitely my cup of tea, even if the accent and taste in clothes shop of my partner in crime, Kate, isn't as such.  So why dead end you say? Well, frankly I've never been a huge fanatic of the the postal slave labour trade, however there have been occasional moments of joy - such as serving tea and biscuits to the junior school teachers, and the staff all seem rather friendly and polite and in full awareness of there 200+ IQs, which can come in handy if they had a mischievous side to them including money laundering and transportation of illegal immigrants and alike. Alas they are all law abiding citizens, and lovely one's really. However, if there has been some advantage to the whole experience, which I value the most, is seeing how I can improve my overall poetry (well sex poetry) and general literary skills I reckon.  I feel I've gotten to know Kate somewhat, and I've changed my opinion on her somewhat from the stagnate blond townie from TL at Esher, to someone who has somewhere, an inner beauty about her. Well I did say somewhere - didn't I? Other things which come to mind about the place - I shall most definitely rant/bitch upon tonight.  Since days have lasted from 10/10:30 - 5:30/6 respectively, maintaining a consistent social/blogging life hasn't been the easiest of things, however I did manage to live up to my promise for Rowan, and see his ever improving band and band support (even though half of them are pretentious in the closet twats) -  Lunatic Crash  at the  Half Moon  in Putney. The drum/guitar/vocal-screeching solos seem to be gathering improving speed, and volume and, well class to be honest. If there's anyone from school who's going to make it in the music industry, it will be Rowan, and I should suspect, in Lunatic Crash.  I discovered, as did Erd, what Jo is really like a couple of days ago, so we are deciding to give as good as we got, and raise the volume on the compliment so to speak - I'll update you on that later.  I have no idea what is going on between me and Thomas, and to my joy (and probably his as well) neither do I care as much as the days haul on, I really hate things ceasing before they've even really begun which is apparently what seems to be happening again, which strangely enough, the title of this webpage should sum up in an instant. My friends like E and more recently Jen are far more important to me, especially at the moment, and God knows I want to know these lovelies until I have hair growing from my ear lobes. Sentimental I'm sure. It was quite fascinating to see, from my point of view, when seeing both the friends I've got since joining Esher, and the Halliford patheticos, and really seeing how much more I value the new regime in my life. Take for instance talking to Richard. Now conversation has never been that boys strong point, much like myself, but seeing his weak feeble attempt at humor amidst his " Nawberry " and his lackluster conversational skills (worse than when he was 11 for crying out loud), I could finally, once and for all (well close enough but not 100% there I guess) put those 5 years to rest. Lets see when the time passes, that night really tipped the scales between recovery and happiness. xBuBzx
