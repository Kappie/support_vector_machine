I've never been a creationist, so that option was out but then it asked if God had created/is guiding evolution or if Religion has nothing to do with it.  I've been in my Pantheistic mindset (which to all non-atheist makes me an atheist), so I really didn't know what to put, and I actually felt under a bit of stress.  Oh well.    Carry on then.
