I used to think that Bush was down-right evil.  After seeing the film, I think he's more just inexperienced and a little afraid to do what he thinks is right.  I actually think that, with more experience in politics and less presidential coaching from his dad, he could have been a mediocre president.  But that's all oil under the bridge now.
