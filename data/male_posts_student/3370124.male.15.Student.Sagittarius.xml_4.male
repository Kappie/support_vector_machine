I like this blogspot thing better in some ways.. Like, it is WAY easier to post stuff. Just type it and boom, I'm done. I guess I'm just too lazy to do it myself these days.. All my old stuff has been moved here. You can still see my old web  urlLink here.   There's a couple things I still need to do here. I need to learn how to use this so I can add stuff on the bar. Yep, I'm a no0b.
