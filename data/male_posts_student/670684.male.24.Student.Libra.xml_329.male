I always equated the blog to my college radio show...if folks were listening, great, but I never really assumed they were.    The  urlLink docudrama  blog is going to get a facelift soon, but content should noticeably improve...if you are interested in my thesis topic.  Using it as a rah-rah for myself is pointless...let's see if this works better.  My Centenary story was running towards a mention of Dr. Alexander before class interrupted the bloggage.  So now it sounds like excessive pandering to mention him, but in my Centenary career, their greatest mistake was letting him go.  Centenary drove forward into the information age when Dr. Alexander was on faculty...students built websites en masse (my web presence is a byproduct of his reach), communication and BBS was introduced into curriculum, tenets of postmodernism that arrive with telecommunications resonated with students, and a more interdisciplinary approach was taken to the English major, a discipline that seemed archaic from the bios of many other Centenary faculty (not to disparage them...I loved my classes with Havird, Shelburne, Newtown, and Hendricks).    I understand that Centenary doesn't have the money to get into bidding wars for faculty, but when you luck into a faculty member who pushes the entire school towards the essence of a liberal arts education, and who resonates with students to a degree unprecedented, do your best to keep him.
