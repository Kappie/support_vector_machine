In fact, i am sure that i can never pick a girl up. Not guts. I mean, it's so embarrassin.. I don't even know the chick, wad if i get rejected? Bleah... Screw it. That's why i'm still single.        So wad I am tryin to say is that... I'm not retarded... So please don't compare to those handicapped people. It's just evil.. And if i was retarded, I'll look something like the picture below.
