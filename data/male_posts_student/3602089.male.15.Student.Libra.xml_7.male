I have used a little music format converter for a while and decided to fool around with the bit rate and file type.  I converted some .WMA files into mp3s because Apple won't play windows media audio formats...go figure.  Lol...anyway, I discovered that the songs sound perfect, except there is still not enough bass to satisfy me.  I don't exactly know what I did differently this time to change the format because all of the settings are the same as last time I did this.  Anyway, I have only eleven more days until I fly to Europe for twenty-one days, which is going to be very fulfilling for my travel craving for a few months.  The drivers' saftey classes I have been taking all of this week and will continue to for the length of next weeks is total hell.  The teacher acts like a younger version of Mr. Rogers on delta-9 tetrahydrocanabinol, or even crack cocain...it doesn't matter, he's a little too happy in the mornings but is annoying at the same time, which is nearly impossible for the rest of us.  Now, I must look for my camera tripod before my trip so I don't miss the perfect long exposure shot of the Notre Dame cathedral...this house is such a mess I'll never find it in the piles of shiz flooding my "space"...
