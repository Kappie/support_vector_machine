In school today, for PE lesson, we did the ACES Day workout at the hockey pitch as the hall was used up by the Seconday 4NA for their Prelims. The actions of the workout were so lame man... I remembered the last dance I did last time was "Let's get loud" by J.Lo . Yeah~ it was cool and funky. The exercise included "Where is the love" by Black Eye Peas. Ms Yeow did not come to school today again, so our class went outside the staff room to assemble. Quite a "bored" first half of the day. After recess, it was History. I felt relieved when there was no test. We did sourced based questions. During E Maths lesson, we have A Maths test. After the test, we had "conflicts" for the last question. We kept argueing for the last question to see who is right... hahahax.. get back the paper then see who correct la! Lol. Today got no homework.. so slack man. Ok, I'll stop here today...  Nothing much happening today. I'm off to watch EPL Highlights on ESPN.  Cyaz.. Good Bye!~
