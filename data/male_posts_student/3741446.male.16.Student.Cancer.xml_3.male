For the lucky who have never heard of n-gage,it's suppost to be some handheld system thing that doubles as a cell phone.That's pretty gay considering the damn thing costs $250.I have a much better idea.Go to walmart and buy a cellphone.Then go to a video games store and buy a gameboy advance sp. The n-gage had a great take off.Then that great take off went straight to hell and now it sucks ass.Graphics suck ass.Sound sucks ass.N-gage sucks ass.  What the fuck is up with the gaytastic advertizment for this thing?Ok I will guide you through if you have never seen it before(only the lucky few).A ninja is in a laundromat cleaning his cloths.His machine gets stuch.He punches it.STOP!If I was a ninja,I wouldn't punch it,I would whip out my badass dragon sword and slice the thing into cubes. Anyway,on with the commercial.Some chick comes over and unjams the machine he is using.He then says "unstuck".He is about to put his pussy ninja panties in there when he spys another ninja.A PINK ninja.A PINK DUDE ninja.He drops his panties and draws his sword.So does the PINK DUDE ninja.Then there's some shit about the n-gage QD.End commercial.Overall,a pretty gay ass commercial for a pretty gay ass piece of hardware.
