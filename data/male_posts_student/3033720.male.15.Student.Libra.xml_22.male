Last week has been pretty good; maybe things are starting to look up, I guess I'll soon see.  Here's something great to keep you guys occupied. This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. Don't worry, no nudity. You'll need quick time, and if you don't have it just download it when it asks, its fairly small.  urlLink WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!
