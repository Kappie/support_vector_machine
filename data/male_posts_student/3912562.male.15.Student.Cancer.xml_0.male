We later became better friends in 4th grade and pretty much became good friends in 5th grade. Six years after 5th grade were still friends.  He moved out of Brick into Howell during the summer after 5th grade. He started the drums in 6th grade and in my opinion is very good at it now.  Dan met Chris, Lou, and Ian in Howell and they formed a band called LMS (Last Men Standing). I created the site,  www.thelastmenstanding.tk  who knows if it even exsists anymore.  Dan loves music. I on the other hand couldn't care less if it ever exsisted. But he has got me into it nonetheless. hehe   I still dont understand him fully, but maybe in the near future we'll start asking and talking more about eachother so we can fully understand one another. I figured out Dan is a very smart dude in areas of interest, and he is starting to realize that it's not all about getting laid. He's probably the only friend I know that actually uses their head and thinks once and a while. People at this age get bored easily and quickly turn on the radio so they have something to do. Not once in their life will they use their brain. This falls towards girls especially. I only wish the girl I marry in the future wont be as annoying or stupid as most girls ive met.  Woops! Kinda strayed from talking about dan. I'm going to gradually compile this post until I die. In memory of my friend Dan...   (although he's hopefully not dead, since I made this whole thing to show him before !I! Die...)  -Paul
