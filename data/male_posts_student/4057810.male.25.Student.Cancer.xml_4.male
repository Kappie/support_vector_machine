In particular, he spoke about how cynicism and pessimism seems to have become the hallmark of sophistication, and optimism, in people, in life, in the future, is viewed as being unfashionable.  It's one of the things that really makes me furious, listening to people flaunt their cynicism, because they think that the dark perspective they possess, the more thought it will appear they have given to an issue.  It makes me angry because most of the people I know who act in this manner really don't have any business acting like the world is out to get them.  One lady who works with me, grossly overweight, makes a hobby of dispensing opinions laced with pessimism, while wearing a sour sneer to match.  I mention that she's grossly overweight only because that's the only thing, of what I know about her, that she could possibly complain about.  She got a decent job, and family, and clearly has food.  There are people in the world with much less.  It seems to me that it's often the people with the least excuse to be cynical that often are, while those who should be usually aren't.
