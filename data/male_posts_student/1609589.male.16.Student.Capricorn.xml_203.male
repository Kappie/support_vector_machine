I hate that.  I was watching Taken, and one of the characters said something that kinda stuck with me. The quote in green is what stuck. The quotes in red are the guy talking to the person who said that, a 9-year old girl who's like a 6th alien.    "Ally, i mean... every day i get up and i don't see anything until the end of the day. It doesn't ever seem to matter until the end!"   "When you play a song, do you play the whole thing thinking only about the ending?"    "No, i'm..."   "..."   "Ohhhhh!!"   If you haven't seen Taken, you should. I'm gonna try to buy the DVD pack.  I had to goto the Dermitologist 3day and he told me i have a "disease" on my arm called karrotus chuchgsljfseofj i dont care what the hell it's called.  He also said that 7 out of 10 people have it, worldwide.  Doesn't that make it NOT a disease when 70 FUCKING percent of the world has it???  They also said it doesn't hurt, or look bad(its usually in the way-back of your arm where your sleeves are), or turn into anything serious. You know what that means? That means it's not a disease. Diseases are ailments, and something you want to get rid of quickly. I've had this shit all my life apparentally, and it's never bothered me until my mom said ":-O we has to get you to a dermitologist!" Then, all the sudden for some reason, its the most horrible thing in the world that i want to almost cut off myself with a knife.  Not really. It's just as stoopid as it was before.  I can see that some (*cough shallow*) people would think of it as a disease, because it doesn't look completely perfect.  If you haven't noticed, i'm not the master of perfection. I know i'm not a looker, and i don't need any dermitologist medicne to cover it up.  Whatever. If my parents want to spend an ass-load of money on some asshole that made a life choice to look at skin diseases all his life, whatever.
