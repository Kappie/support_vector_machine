That explained why the police were directing traffic at the light up the street.  The entire neighborhood was out, and we didn't know why.  Of course, Diane is in to the Apprentice, and I admit I wanted to see how it turned out (I had picked Bill about six weeks ago).  Plus there were plenty of Hockey games on, and I also had some writing to get done.  It's amazing how dependent we are on power.  We didn't get it back until 12:30.  8.5 hours!  Completely unacceptable.  I'm thinking that an 8.5 hour outage should require some disaster on the magnitude of an asteroid strike, terrorism, or a rampaging Ted Kennedy on a bender.  I still don't have an answer.  For a time, I felt like a resident of Bombay...
