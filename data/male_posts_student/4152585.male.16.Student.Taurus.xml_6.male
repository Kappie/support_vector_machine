That's a great guy your nominating for president.  Also people say President Bush was wrong about going to war with Iraq and also lied to the American people about weapons of MD, yet John Kerry and John Edwards both have been quoted for saying that Saddam needed to be taken out of reign because he was a murderous leader, and the he should be disarmed immediately of all weapons of MD, so why don't liberals say that John Kerry and John Edwards are wrong and are liars?
