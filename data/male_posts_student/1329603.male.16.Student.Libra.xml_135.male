Her voice is nice to hear... hm, phoning her may be seen as a bit blatant but I miiiissed her so I wanted to say hi ^_^. Hm, are you supposed to really sorely miss someone you're not going out with? I don't know, but still, *many hugs to the returned-from-Venice-peoples*.  Still haven't heard the results of the brass band contest... *twiddles thumbs*  Scott and I went to Ikea today with the mum and the Gwen, war funlich. I got a new chair and some brightly coloured spheres. Funfun. I couldn't find me sexy light though, oh well. N'est pas grave. Scott and I had our fun, and that's all that matters.  Anyway, I really can't think of anything to say other than *ultima delight* at the peoples being back.  Quote of the day: "Red, I feel my soul on fire. Black, my world if she's not there.
