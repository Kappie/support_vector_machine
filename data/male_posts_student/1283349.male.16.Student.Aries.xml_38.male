Nyah nyah nyah! *does the ferret happydance*  In other news, school is a bitch, and I long for summer like a hobo longs for handouts. I'm nearly desperate here. I had a sweet sweet taste of summer during easter break, then was painfully ripped away and thrust back into school. Aiee... Things are heating up at Jesuit, and as such, the blog will be cooling down for a little while. Oddly enough, Imperian still manages to get enough of my time to waste it, if that makes sense. Rasca is such a funky little dude...hehe, pointed ears.  -Dice Squirrel Bumtastic
