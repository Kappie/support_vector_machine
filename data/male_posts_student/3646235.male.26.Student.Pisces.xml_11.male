Waning faith?  Let's try work.  I'm a fourth year graduate student studying Biomedical Engineering.  My research project involves a molecular analysis of cervical cancer and its progression from normal to cancer.  I use microarrays (gene chips) to study the global expression of every single gene in the human genome at the same time.  Lots of fun, until you have to enter the data into a database.  I've been doing that this week, so boring and so long.  Afterwards, I see spots when I close my eyes, tiny views of the microarray.  It's like when you play a video game like tetris or War Craft, you see the pieces moving around when you close your eyes.  I bet my mom sees cards moving from playing so much solitaire on the computer.  Anyway, I figure I have about 2 more years left of research before I graduate with a doctorate.  Yippie.  Still no idea what I want to do when I grow up.  Ah, my data has just been loaded into the database, so I'm off to look at it.  I think next time we'll talk about the wedding.
