Anyway, don't think I had forgotten.    On a side note, the book at the side has been updated. If any of the link happen to go to the wrong place, please tell me so I can fix that. Another thing, if the page is disorted in anyway (it shouldn't be) tell me that too. Nothing brought that up, but I decided to make a note of it.    On to more detail, I'm going to go through the old post about Msg Plus and upload the image on to Blogger instead of my own host. You didn't have to know that, but I just decided to post it anyway =-P   Oh, and as another side note, updates on the site take much longer time than before. The reason for this is it has to go through and update every page, so please be aware that when I am updating the template (say the book) on every page, it may not show up correctly for a minute or more.
