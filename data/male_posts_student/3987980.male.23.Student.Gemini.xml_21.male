Todd is going to be attending Full Sail for the game design program. So I guess I'll have to warn him on some of the coming attractions Full Sail has to offer. Like the pain of that Calculus class. Yesterday Olivier moved out. Glad that pothead is out the place. Smelled up the hallway everyday! Noisy and for some reason did laundry EVERY morning for 2 weeks! Always waking me up damnit. I tried to get alot of sleep this morning (plus a little of the afternoon). Mother woke me up with a call at noon. I have no idea why she called cause I brought up every topic. Trying to get back to sleep wasn't happening cause now someone is hammering in the apartment next to my room.  Well that's a nice and randomly written out Blog for ya....Later
