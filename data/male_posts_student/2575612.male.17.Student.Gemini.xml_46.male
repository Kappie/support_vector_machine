This is tough issue for me, ive shyed away from the God-scene for awhile, but i'm interested into getting back into. We will have to see how it goes, any encourgement is for me is cool! ; )  - I need money! I really need a good idea for a small business to make some Mula this summer!  -Africa- I'm so pumped, how cool is it that i get to go to Africa this summer...for over TWO WEEKS! when i went to haiti, each time was just 11 days. I'm not sure how everything will go down but im excited for what God may reveal to me.  To tie this in, I've been really searching (more or less) for something meaningful and worthwhile in life. I've began to fill my time and efforts with knowledge. Wisdom and book-smarts to me are key. But after reading a tad big of Ecclesiates, one of the greatest books every written, its come to my attention that this longing for knowledge and wealth is ridiculous as Solomon stated:     I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.  I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men!  I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.    Also he wrote later on in 2:15-16    Then I thought in my heart,   "The fate of the fool will overtake me also.  What then do I gain by being wise?"  I said in my heart,  "This too is meaningless."   For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered;  in days to come both will be forgotten.  Like the fool, the wise man too must die!    So my whole quest to learn and seek has been proven meaningless! How can this be? Well all humans have a desire to be accepted, to communicate and  find truth . Well this is a MAJOR post so im gonna rejuvenate and blog again later.
