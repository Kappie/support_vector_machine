(i'm exaggerating but hey its my story) there the young stud saw all sorts of types... christine orchard, mason, roz, matt hryb, brian yuhas, tom scibana, liz orchard, chrissy g... the diversity of life in a nutshell (yeah i know thats not any black people and yea i said diversity. but white people at bedford is diversity). it was a frigid night but fitting for a bhs homecoming. doug stayed up in the stands freezing his tail off even with christine in an attempt to keep each other from hypothermia. they did not succeed and soon became human popsicles. at the half time homecoming king and queen were annonced. dan schroeter and not jackie hill. trying to cheer up jackie in the 3rd quarter, he allowed her to tap that big round asian ass. but since it was a homecoming game the bearcats lost with a close... 56-single digit :(. after the game doug made his way with danny wagner and a small group to cyber pete's (aka a warm place). as dan was ordering his famous hot cocoa of that night, liz recieved a distraught message from her sis christine. "matt got jumped... at carli's...." mixed in with a lot of crying. jump in the car run up there to get them. an array of ambulances and police cars with about 30 people lay before them as they drove to the house. through all the mess matt is okay. jack and andy are too. holly got hit in the face by one of the douche (sp? maybe i should ask ms. kozak) bags. big erin, the humugous 6'7 300 pound black guy is in the hospital. armond (potential broken rib) yelling at a cop that he's not going to the hospital. the explanation was 4 big drunk seniors drove up asked how the game was and proceeded to wail on matt. everyone jumps in, fill in the gaps. nobody was identified either. so after getting andy home dan and doug and again everybody back to cyber petes. where the kids finished that hot cocoa from before. then back to the orchards. where the night ended. the young doug made it back home and fell asleep around 2. just your average night.... how'd u guys like it? needs some editing. but wait that was just friday night. tonights the dance to. can't wait... stay warm and most importantly safe.
