 Beat Peasant's Quest today all by myself. Pretty satisfying ending. Spent last night with Jack and friends. Working tomorrow. Packing my closet tonight, or at least as much as I can get done. Quiet day, but these things needed to happen. Have lots of boxes to fill. Should have written in complete sentences, but a little tired.
 Currently  rooting through:  my old clothes
