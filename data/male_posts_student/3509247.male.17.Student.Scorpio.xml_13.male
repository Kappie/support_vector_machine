I didn't think anybody read or cared anymore about my blog, but I suppose I'm back by "poplular" (and I use the term very loosely) demand (again, a very loosely used word). Let's see..... I got a hair cut and I went to Chicago I enjoyed Chicago a lot again. We didn't do very much this time. I did run 7 miles though. I don't know what's wrong with me. I had to stop after 4 for a one minute breather ;P. I've been doing a lot of working. I'll skip a lot of stuff just because I can't remember what I've been up to (although I have been going to Bre's quite a bit). If you will, please notice the link to my rite side that says "Through Bre's BlueEyes." That's a link to her new blog. If you get the chance check it out. In any case, the only interesting thing I have to talk about is that new show Ahmish in the city. It was pretty cool, I think. Ahmish people apparently have a period of time at the end of their teen years when they are allowed to go into public to see whether they want to continue in their menonite ways or stay in society. Anyway, this show is about 5 Ahmish living in this big house with 6 city people and they do different things each day and they cook and swim and talk and hang out. I like it. In any case I watched it with my cousins tonight so it was pretty good. Anyways, it's gettin late to I'll talk to you guys later.
