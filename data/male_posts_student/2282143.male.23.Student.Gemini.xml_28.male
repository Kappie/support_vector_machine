After much deliberation and controversy, I have decided that we can call them athletes.  Sitting in a car going really really fast does take alot out of you, and you kinda have to be smart and you definately need lightning fast reflexes.  But I mean, you need intelligence and endurance in chess, but do we call them athletes?  Crap.  Im torn again.  Oh well.  Perhaps this will never be resolved.  Anyone have any opinions on this?  On a positive note, I can retake the test I only got a 75% on today.  Was a little bit pressed for time on getting back here so I could watch baby cause Jim was getting out of work late, so I rushed big time.  Maybe will take that tomorrow after I pay my millions of dollars in tuition to COD.  Figured out John was right about my neck.  When doing head raises, I felt something grind and then proceeded to feel my lower back tighten up.  Crazy how that happens.  Guess I just need to go easy until its better.  But Im eating way too much and Im fat.  Now I sound like a whiny little bitch.  Well, thats cause I am one.  Thats right.  I admit it.  Im a whiny little bitch and I've lost my testicles.  They fell off.  At least Im honest.  Chickenfucker.   Oh yeah, and you can't be a non-conformist unless you drink coffee...
