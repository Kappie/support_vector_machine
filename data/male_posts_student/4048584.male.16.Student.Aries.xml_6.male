My grandfather who is around 80ish has to go soon (very saddening for me since ive known him all my life and hes my last of my grandparents to survivie). but hey what can we do? thats life... we cant do anything about it either... which kinda its sucky.... its just hard for me to see my last grandparent to see him on that hospital bed just sleeping and not doing so well... well this is jason, signing off from NYC... Peace. Best of luck to all!
