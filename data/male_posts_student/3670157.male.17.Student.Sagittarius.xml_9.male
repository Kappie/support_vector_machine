And forever it will be. So I look ahead to the future and the one waiting for me. The last just ran me over.  Once again I see that look But I remember what you took I can stare cold in your eyes Emotionless through your cries You say I’m not the same Well I say it sounds quite lame You start to fear and ask me why I can’t explain why should I There’s no way to really say I loved you back; yesterday I wanted to give you my heart But all you did was tear it apart And I’ve shed enough tears And I’ve bowed to too many fears You can look for me by your side But I’ll be ahead I jumped off this ride
