SOME people see an arabic looking guy walking down the street, they shun him and call the cops who go over and ask for his ID, with the safety pins on their Sig Sauers off. i mean, who cares if it was his GRANDPA who came from  the middle east, and he probably knows every word in the Constitution and/or the National Anthem  (which is more than i could say about most citizens in any country), but still, hey, he has dark skin, has a goatee (coz his gurlfriend told him it looks cute), he must have a bomb in his pocket and probably knows Osama. i mean, come on! can anyone stand up and tell me that's not bullshit?  	look, i respect the need for security. being lax in a time like this is stupid. that's like going to the projects wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood (remember Scary Movie 3 :D) . but (i think) there should be a limit to this... i mean, isn't america all about freedom? where's the dude's freedom in the above situation? i admit, i have never been in your situation, where your country is at war, and national security is threatened (damn, i'm lucky i'm in Malaysia... most peaceful place to be!!!)... PERHAPS i would be paraniod if i was in that situation. maybe not. hopefully not. but i plan to continue my education next year at Purdue University, Indiana. but that's not the point.  	what i'm trying to say is... perhaps we all should give people a chance... i mean, i am totally against labelling a whole race or summin just because of some idiots... because i know how it feels... as some of you might (or might not) know, malaysia is a multiracial country. the three major races here are the Malays (those who's ancestorial roots are in this country), the Malaysian Chinese (malaysian, but have ancestorial roots in China), and the Malaysian Indians (malaysian with ancestorial roots from India - my great-grandma moved from a village in South India and came here). Malaysia is more of a cultural mosaic, not a melting pot.  	in my school, a majority of Malaysian Indian boys don't really come from a privileged background. some of them have serious disciplinary problems at school. gangs, smoking, stuff like that. but, because of that, most people and teachers who see me, a big-bodied, tough-looking dark-skinned dude, they ASSUME i'm a gangsta-type dude too. But, the harsh reality is, i'm NOT! i'm a very gentle guy, polite, very well-mannered, and don't forget smart (no.3 in the whole school). but, newbie teachers, or those who don't know me, they see me, and they assume i'm a dangerous guy to be around with. of course, those who got to know me have a lot of respect for me (hehe... :D:D:D)   	what i'm trying to say is, don't judge a book by it's cover.  	anti-semitism is another example, but i really don't want to get into that now.  	i mean, what do you think about this? i hope reading this has somehow sparked off some neurons in your brains... i'm a very non-judgemental guy... i don't think that anyone is inherentmy bad, or good... your enviroment shapes the way you turn out... i mean, some terrorists... they are who they are because the enviroment shaped them... the people, the physical enviroment... i'm a peace loving guy... but with people with a set mindset who do terrorist actions, and wor-mongering presidents like Dubya around... it's just like a cycle... somehow it got started... then america under GBsenior went to war with iraq... then on September 11, some idiots retaliated... then another war-mongering idiot goes to war with THE WHOLE BLOODY COUNTRY over something some people did... then he moves to ANOTHER country... attacking it in a made-up accusation (where are those nukes, goddammit? :P)... sooner or later, someone's gonna strike back... and there it goes again... until we have someone smart enough to put a stop to this... yeah, after my death, most likely...  	i'm sorry if i offended anyone... that wasn't my intention... and like i said, i don't believe, like , all americans or all arabs are so-and-so just because of a few individuals... i'm an individualist... every person is unique... i just hoped i made you think about this...  -MistaMugie-
