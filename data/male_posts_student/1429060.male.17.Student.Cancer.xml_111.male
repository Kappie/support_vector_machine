However, I did get to go give blood (one pint) this morning. I am now a donor, so I am happy. My blood type is likely to be O pos or O neg, being that both Mom and Dad are O positives.  I got a hat this morning that I have been looking at for a while now. I also recieved the  Biological Exuberance  book. I shall be reading these instead of summer reading, and thus, Mrs. AP lady will destroy me.   listening to:  I'm a Believer by Smash Mouth (on my new Shrek CD)  Holla.
