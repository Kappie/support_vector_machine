It oversimplified the way I stole the election  8. Too many of them fancy college-boy words  7. If Michael Moore had waited a few months, he could have included the part where I get him deported  6. Didn't have one of them hilarious monkeys who smoke cigarettes and gives people the finger  5. Of all Michael Moore's accusations, only 97% are true  4. Not sure - - I passed out after a piece of popcorn lodged in my windpipe  3. Where the hell was Spider-man?  2. Couldn't hear most of the movie over Cheney's foul mouth  1. I thought this movie was supposed to be about dodgeball   As we all know, this is the week of the democratic national convention in boston.and in watching the speakers speak and the delegates, well, delegate, it makes me think about the democratic platform vis-a-vis the republican platform.shouldn't the democratic platform be a pretty easy sell to most americans?the democratic platform is(if anyone bothered to articulate it clearly...)-   1-pro-education 2-pro-envrionment 3-pro-working families 4-pro strong and multilateral foreign policy 5-pro-economic growth(if you disagree with this i propose that you look at how the economy fared under 8 years of bill clinton...) 6-pro-health care 7-pro-diversity 8-pro-national security(the most effective national security leaders tend to be pragmatic democrats, or would you rather have paul wolfowitz and john ashcroft looking after the nations security?)   whereas the republicans tend to be:  1-pro-corporations 2-anti-environment(bush has cut billions from environmental protection)3-anti-education(bush has cut billions from education) 4-anti-health care 5-poor foreign policy(just look at the standing of the u.s overseas under bush as opposed to under clinton...)6-anti-diversity(or as bush puts it, his base is 'the have's, and the have more's..')  So why do so many americans think of themselves as republicans? And how do republicans support george bush, a draft dodging, inept politician who presided over the loss of 2 million jobs and created the largest federal deficit in the history of the u.s and lied to congress and the american people about reasons for starting a war that has resulted in thousands of unnecessary deaths?The democrats simply have the better platform, but the republicans win when it comes to lying and appealing to people's atavistic and base instinct.These are odd times.
