Mainly because his wife died(no sympathy please: he is nothing more than a construct in our minds: if you dare say he's more, get a life!)   I think James Bond married someone in one movie and then she was killed later. But knowing Bond he probably went on some sort of revenge trip(yeah, that's what he was up to in Die Another Day, for the unlearned out there.)  But Jack and James... They BOTH fight terrorists The terrorists they fought were in BOTH cases riddiculous charactatures... James fought media and oil tycoons mostly, Jack seems to go after terrorists who are incredibly organised, civilised(well that word's just there for effect) and in other ways not Osama Bin Ladenish (who apparently has a  urlLink sister in law . If it was some other celebrity, such an interview would seem ridiculous and petty but in this case...) They BOTH are highly moment in history specific... James Bond appeals to Cold Warian times, Jack is most definitely post-Stalin, post-Hitler, post-Cold war and post-911 which seems to work for us now for some reason  In any case, 24 rocks!
