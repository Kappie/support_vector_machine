Well, let me introduce myself, I'm James, 14 years old with characteristics that you wouldn't normally find in a 14 year old, and I live in North Carolina.  Don't be expecting posts left and right, either.  I shouldn't even be on the computer. But I do have a life outside the house.  Well, that's all I have to say for now.
