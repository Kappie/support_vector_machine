Schools was off yesterday and i dont have anything to do--- that kind of anxiety when you eat chocolate cake with ice cream and chocolate chips with white icing and a glass of milk and vanilla. You know what I mean?   I like to keep my music to myself, i dont like other people who i know enjoying the same music as i do. Alex listens to refused. Lots of people, MAnuel, Robeerto and Ignacio listen to AFX. Some people listen to Against All Authority. Im keeping KITH and oppose to myself. I hate you, people.  I dont know What The Hell happened to ju ju. HAS NOT logged in. Now, if i could only find another suicidal friend or some oppose lyrics, i would be just fine.  Take You Away, Take You To Play.
