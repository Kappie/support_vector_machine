Alyse Leonard::::::::: this is to you, i didn't get to say good-bye to you at all since we hung out on Friday and I've been really hoping I could, but I can't find your phone number anywhere and you're not online at all, so I wanted to say good-bye and have fun at summer camp and hopefully I'll see you when your get back on Thursday or before you leave on Monday. XOXO byebye
