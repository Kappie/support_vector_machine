Beyond simply wanting to spend time with a truly special person, I do feel that I am in the right place at the right moment.  After many months of intense political agitation, I have been able to channel some of my anger into a job.  I'm currently working as a canvass supervisor with  urlLink ACT , an organization committed to pursuading, registering, and mobilizing voters for the progressive cause in  urlLink battleground states like Ohio .  The actions of the Bush administration would be much more depressing if I felt completely unable to do anything about it.  I'm going to take some courses at  urlLink Ohio State  while I'm here, and I feel much more motivated about it than I ever expected.  After years of uncertainty and aimless study, my fresh desire to work for social change has finally given me a sense of direction.  Taking time off from school was precisely what I needed to do; simply pushing forward without any clear objective had only been destructive for me.  Regardless of how I proceed, I'm confident that my further academic pursuits will not only be successful, but meaningful.
