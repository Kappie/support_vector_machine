Let's see, and let's back up...I arrived back to Rochester on June 20th to find our friend, Garwin, who had come and stay for a few days.  Well, a few days became a week, two weeks, three weeks, and now it's the 4th week and I'm beside myself in wits!  I wish he would find another place to crash....I'm losing my sense of privacy, my sense of MY APT., and my sense of MY CAT!  Once company comes, my cat loves their attention and tend to ingore me.  Knowing myself, I can't deal with that.  I can't even walk around buck naked..gotta have my robe on to walk to the bedroom from the shower.  It's a PITA!    School is ok.  I finally finished PLE class for the summer...think I'll get an A.  It was a fun class, but waste of my time! :)  Now, I have Shakespeare left to focus on.  My paper's due tomorrow at 6 pm, and I'm only on the 2nd page as I'm typing this post.  I can't wait for that class to get over with!  It's too complicated for my little pretty brain.  Work--ah, let's not go there.    Other than that, I'm puttering around and getting by during the days.  I can't wait til this weekend...Eric and I are going to CT this Friday for Rachel and Mick's wedding...Saturday will be our mini trip to Mystic Seaport and Aquarium (anyone going to the wedding is welcome to join us).  Sunday, we'll check out of the hotel and go up to Albany to have dinner with my parents.  Yes, my parents and Eric will actually sit down and try to be civil with one another.  I'm praying that it'll go successfully because it will be the time to announce our wedding date to my parents and get started from there.  Really, I can't think of much more to say here...and Lucky is staring at me waiting to be petted, so Lucky shall have my attention while I'm waiting for dinner to be cooked for my little tummy.  ta-ta for now, Brooke
