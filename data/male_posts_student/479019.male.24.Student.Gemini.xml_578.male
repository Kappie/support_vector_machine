It as a genre of music is hard enough to pin down. For example, the big 3 consisting of the Ramones, Sex Pistols, and Clash. They sound nothing a like and are considered punk. Buzzcocks, Cock Sparrer, Stiff Little Fingers, and the Damned all sound different. The LA scene had goth and surf tossed into the mix. X, Agent Orange, Adolescents, TSOL, and Bad Religion. Social D had a touch of country. There was also the whole new wave thing. Basically everything in the real world is a spectrum. When you look at a color wheel, when does green become yellow or blue? It's a gradient. Yet it's nice to know what something is. That's why we have labels.   Last night I met up with George and Samantha at Dave and Buster's and caught up on stuff. It was fun. I hadn't seen Samantha in over a year so it was cool to see how she's doing. Too bad Julia couldn't make it. She was busy with her training down in SD.   Audio Karate show tonight with Diana. Live music is always good, but I have to take it easy. I'm still post concussion.  ***
