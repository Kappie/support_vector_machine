Anyway, let us begin   4)People who play with their ringtones, On buses, in school anywher where i happen to be, They make me want to get the phone, and ensure that the next timke that tune would be heard, it wuld be comin out of tht persons ass.   3)glory hunting supporters, usually seen in real madrid/arsenal/man united shirts, fine if you come from manchester or madrid or london, if not what the hell are you doin wearing them or supporting them? As soon as Roman Abroamavich bought chelsea, a sea of 4-9 year olds suddenly went chelsea, back stabbing bastards.   2)getting to the nitty gritty now-  the kind of people who have very strong opinions about things, be it sexual orientationor the gulf war II or whatever, but they feel the need to shove it down our throats, and nobody else has an opnion on the matter. They ask you what your opnion is on the matter, for the soul purpose of then saying what theirs is, they dont ask cos they wanna know yours. so dont be fooled.   1) CHILDREN BETWEEN 2-10- Im not a horrible person, if a child is resonably nice, and polite and good then i dont mind them, but all the time i see children throwing tantrums, dominating their parents, and being disrespectful. The parents dont so shit about it, and it make s me sick. They also get into your stuff and annoy you, deliberatly.   Thats ot a lot of my chest actually, feel better for that. anyways i'll post normal stuff shortly..  later   m.c
