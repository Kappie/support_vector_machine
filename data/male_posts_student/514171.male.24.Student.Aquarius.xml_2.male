In other words, "takaful" is simply a concept for distributing money to participants if any untoward accidents such as fire, accidents, critical illness, etc. afflicts the participant of a particular takaful product. In other words, not much difference from the conventional system.  But what's the difference, you may ask? Simple. The concept of Takaful does not contain elements in a conventional insurance system that renders it forbidden from the Islamic point of view. Takaful does not contain gharar, it does not contain maisir and it does not contain riba'. These elements are present in the conventional insurance system, which is why conventional insurance is considered forbidden. That does not mean, however, that only Muslims can enter the Takaful scheme. I have seen non-Muslims taking our products and they have praised our system which is far superior than the conventional insurance companies.
