But we did blow up like 4 stuffed animals with fireworks. One little guy shot 20 feet in the air and exploded-hehehe. I've noticed that for all my blogs so far, I do them in the early AM, so technically it's the next days' blog but it isn't, it's summer, so I stay up late and i get bored and do the blog. And I really only goto bed because I'm bored. Well I'm bored. goodnight *fake yawn.*   urlLink    This is Shane.   urlLink    This is Shane headbanging.   urlLink    Shane likes Sprite.
