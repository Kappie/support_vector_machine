I've been meaning to think of a new name for this worthless journal (because "Jimtopia" sucks), but haven't been able to get anywhere. So i says to myself: "let other people do it!" And i'm going to.  Leave a comment  (click "Comment" in the byline bar) with a suggestion for a new name. And get me a soda.  End Transmission.
