I could have made time for him but I'm just in a miserable mood that I don't know how to want to get out of. Sometimes I wish that I could control if I was in love or not. It hurts so much when you love a person and lose their love. I'm not talking with her. I figure that she will like to get on with her life and that I will need the chance to forget about her so I can do well at school this year. I'm not so sure anymore that I care. The only thing going through my mind right now is thoughts about how to get her back. The thing that hurts the most is that I know that none of them will work. I worry about her, she hates herself right now and she won't tell me why. I have hurt her in the past and she says that she has forgiven me but I don't know if she has. But maybe that is just me not forgiving myself for what I've done but I don't know.
