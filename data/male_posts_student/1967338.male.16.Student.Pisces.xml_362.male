But, you see, all of the dark side stuff and the crumbling of the Republic-- he engineered all of that. It was all part of his plan! He is Darth Sidious! And since he is menacing the Republic and no one knows it's him... that makes him... the Phantom Menace! Sio Bibble was a pretty good red herring, though. Next time: Anakin is WHO?  It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.
