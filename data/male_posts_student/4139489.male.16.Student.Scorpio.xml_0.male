I haven't played this game for almost a year, so for it to be in my dreams shows you it's effect since 1999 :). It was in cs_militia, a deserty type map. Now it was the back of the militia map but was mostly in Irvine, near Tustin Market Place. Between my old neighborhood and the TMP, was a barren deserty field. Now the house from the map was there, but everything else wasn't. What the house looks like in militia...    So there was a long street, coming from TMP to a little buissness center type place, where they were putting up buildings, and to the left was the house from militia. This is what it looked like...    Now I had a team, but they were fuck tards and they couldn't do shit, go figure. I was using the SIG552. This is what it looks like...    So I went around back and just killed all the T's, and my team didn't do shit, so I was kinda pissed off. Now after a little while of that they leave, and walk down the street. Now down the street there is Jessica Simpson... yes, Jessica Simpson... dead though. She looked like she was standing up and then just fell backwards onto one of those green electrical box things. She was wearing some white gown/dress thing. My team was just rushed to her and they were talking and some construction workers went over there also to see what was going on. I went back to my spawn (the other end of the street) and some two kids were walking the other way (towards Jessica). They looked at me funny so I walked up to them and they talked trash, and as I'm about to smack this kid upside the head with the butt of my rifle, an old pick-up truck comes along and stops infront of me. So I look in and there is some guy in there who is now defending these kids. He gets out and I walk backwards some and as I'm doing that my brother riding a bike, randomly comes and goes between us. Just then I pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed the guy in his chest, and said something along the line of "You piece of shit cock sucking faggot, don't try to pull that shit", we then pushed him to the ground and beat the shit out of him (was quite fun) and then Ellen Cleghorne (from SNL)    who I guess is a cop, in a red Chevy Blazer drives up and looks as we are killing this guy, and drives away. that was pretty much it. Very weird one, I must say. Also pretty short.
