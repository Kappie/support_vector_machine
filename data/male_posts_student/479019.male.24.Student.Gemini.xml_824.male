Gaudencio said classes shouldn't be 3 hrs long, and I agree with him.  I ate at the Food Coop w/ Melissa today... a student run place, not the corporate, prison running, crap food serving Sodhexho food court.  Oh yea and the weather is getting fucking cold again. The weather says wintry mix on Friday, which means no Pennywise for me. Bleh...  I chit chatted with Crystal on the phone today, cause I was bored and didn't wanna do work. The lucky girl got today off due to Presidents day...  Now playing: No Use For A Name - "Sleeping in"  I'm not particularly happy with my lack of energy lately... maybe it's cause I'm not following my work out plan? I guess I haven't been eating as well as I usually do?  **
