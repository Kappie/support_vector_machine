Friends: Why They Are Important      Suddenly, he was stabbed.  Caesar looked down at the razor sharp dagger in his chest.  He placed his hands over the bleeding wound.  In an instant, he collapsed.  Surely he would die here.  Before he crossed over, Julius took one final look at the now-spinning room.  It was filled with snickering faces.  Then he recognized someone, his longtime friend Brutus.  He had been betrayed.  With his last breath he uttered, "And you too, Brutus."      Caesar's head fell against the cold, marble floor.  Julius, the great emperor, had been killed by his best friend.  Brutus' role in history shows the impact of friends throughout the ages.      Have you ever heard the saying blood is thicker than water?  Some people believe that family should come before true friends.  However, friends can be just as important.  A friend could be like the family you never had.  When you can't rely on your family, you can definitely count on your friends. They share a type of connection, unmatched by anything else.  Families can break apart or divorce, but a good friendship is stronger.  Many people would do anything for a friend in need.      Studies show that the qualities you look for in a friend may actually be traits you are lacking.  If you want a dependable friend, maybe you feel you need to be more dependable yourself.  Perhaps you've been lied to or mislead in the past.  This too might explain why you choose to be friends with certain people.      A friend can be anyone.  Many people choose animals for companions.  Most animals, such as dogs, are loyal to the end.  Pets and their owners have a special kind of friendship.  The owners are kind and provide the animal with what they need, and in return the animal supplies the human need of acceptance and love. Most owners treat their pets just like a human acquaintance.  In many ways, they can be some of the greatest friends.  Everyone remembers their first pet.  Though they may not see it, a lot of people act like or share traits with their pets.      People need friends.  All humans must have interaction.  Sever psychological problems can result from not enough exposure to people who like them for themselves.  Just look at the Columbine incident.  Those people who killed felt left out and unliked.  If even one person was one of those boy's friends, maybe none of that would have happened.  By even being kind to someone, you are a friend.  This can make a significant difference in someone's life.  Instead of being rude or mean, try to get along with other people.  You never really know when you might need them.  Maybe, just maybe, if you get along, you two could become good friends.   Aleisa Moussa    Now I feel better........
