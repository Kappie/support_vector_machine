Well, it was a black pair, that fits good to my newly bought, suit. And what is good is that they are not too fancy so I can have them during normal weekdays too =). The fun about them are that my mum and I was looking for a pair of shoes in two shoe shops, but we didn't find any good pairs. But then my mother found this pair in Coop Forum! =p (Where we usually buy food).  I bought too my graduation from ninth grade; and the suit too. The most people said that I looked really good in it, it's my first suit by the way. It's a little sad to have graduated, because I probably won't see quite many people from my class again. The teacher I won't miss as much, but still; We had some really good teachers!
