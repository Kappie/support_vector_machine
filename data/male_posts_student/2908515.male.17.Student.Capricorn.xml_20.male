Anyway, I see Kevin's page and it was very angsty.  Apparently he failed his driver's test and was very bummed out about it.  Sometimes I feel like that.  You know, when all of my friends are able to do this the first time and pass and I can't I'll feel that I'm less of a person than they are.  I'm not as awesome or cool as they are since I failed my first time.  And I know how I hate people who just go and say "Aww, you'll pass next time."  I damn straight will pass next time.  No, I'm going to fail next time.  Pfft.  Anyway, I decided to comment and I thought about what he wanted to hear at that moment.  Well, I didn't know but I gave a really good attempt.  So I decided to curse him out.  I mean, its different, right?  Basically, I just told him that he will be the same person to me no matter what.  That there are more important things to worry about other than some dumb driver's test.  But I said those two sentences with a bit more energy.  Mixing words like "asswipe" and "fuck" a few times.  It was hard, I'm not used to cursing.  Hehe.  Other than that, today was my last day of forensics at La Salle.  I liked working on the electron microscopes.  I do wish the Professor will send pictures he took of the whole event soon.  I could totally post them on my journals.  Wednesday night, one of my neighbors decided to ring the door bell at 9:00 at night.  It was really unexpected.  She said that she had always looked across the street at our house and had always wanted to talk to us.  But she didn't know how.  So she decided to today.  Or tonight.  Wednesday night.  Sure, whynot.  She likes the artchitecture of the house.  And stuff.  Cool, I guess.  A few minutes later, my next door neighbor knocked on our back door and announced that there was a family of skunks living under our shed.  Right.  Well, the next day, we investigated.  Well, we didn't investigate too much because I was afraid of getting sprayed.  But we didn't find anything.  *Shrug*.  Maybe they moved out.    Cool beans.
