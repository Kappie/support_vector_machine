It seemed rather as if a translucent curtain had been placed across the sun – it shone bleakly on the black horizon of dawn. 	 By the time Cheryl had dressed and went down to the Great Hall for breakfast, all her friends were already there, halfway through their toast, cereal and porridge.  Eunice, her toast en route to her mouth, realized Cheryl was standing there like a fool and beckoned to her. Cheryl saw that she had a piece of paper in her hand. 	 “Timetables,” Eunice said promptly, as soon as Cheryl had arrived at the table and squeezed in between Minyu and her.   	 “Well, how is it?” Cheryl asked as she reached out for a piece of toast.  	 “Doesn’t look too good,” Minyu chipped in. “Double Potions, Double Defense Against the Dark Arts,  Double Divination  – can you believe it? It’s double periods of everything!” 	 Cheryl grabbed a timetable and stared at it for a while. She let out a long groan. Minyu was right – they also had double periods of Arithmancy and Charms.  	 “Two new teachers, one slacker, one gay – what more can we ask for?” Muthu added, shaking his head.  	 Privately, Cheryl agreed. The only good teacher on their list today was Mr. Teo, who was, well, charming.  	 “Have you all seen it?” Two voices chimed from the table to the left. Cheryl turned round, and saw two girls – both members of the school’s Drama Society. The short one on the left with a smiling face and eyes framed with spectacles was called Yvonne, and the other one, slightly taller and much darker, again with a smiling face but with a cleft lip, was called Denise. They were both from Huffelpuff – fifth-years as well. 	 “Seen what?” Matt asked. 	 “The first decree,” Denise said snidely, her voice tinged with impatience. 	 “The one which says ‘Students are not allowed to have fringes’,” Yvonne added in, grinning at Matt. 	 The Griffindoors’ mouths dropped open. It was the first time in their schooling life that they had been faced with such a ridiculous rule.  	 “And just who implemented that rule?” Matt asked, disgruntled. He was one of the few boys in the school who did nothing to their hair – as a result they grew fringes. 	 Denise and Yvonne rolled their eyes again. “ The Kiw ,” they said slowly, with mock awe and wonder. 	 Matt made a funny noise between a curse and a cough. Apparently he didn’t think much of Professor Molekiw. “What if we don’t follow the rule?” he asked a moment later. 	 “The student’s hair will be cut by  the Kiw  himself,” the other two replied, sniggering.  	 ----------  “There’ll be worse to come,” Barnabas said later, as they made their way to the dungeons for Potions.   “Oh, I guess he’ll start banning centre partings,” Hu Ping said in mockery of Barnabas’ neatly parted hair. He received a cold, threatening glare and a poke in the stomach as retribution.  “We’ve arrived,” Cheryl said dully, to stop the guys from bickering. She sat with Minyu and Eunice at a table in the centre of the room, with the guys behind them. This arrangement was convenient as the girls could simply turn around and ask the guys (who were better in Potions) questions regarding the class. No sooner had they sat down than when the hem of black robes swept into sight, soon followed by the rather formidable figure of Minellus Molekiw. He was wearing a most unpleasant smirk on his face. Cheryl wished she could slap him.  He stood in front of the teacher’s table, and looked at the class, the smirk plastered on his face. Cheryl now had a strong urge to throw her cauldron at him.   “Well? I expect to be greeted, you know,” he said, eyes glinting malevolently.  He received a dull chorus of “Good morning, Professor Molekiw.” But Cheryl swore she heard a mocking whisper of “Good morning, Professor  Mole ,” coming from behind her.  “Good morning,” Professor Molekiw replied coldly. “As I am sure you know, I will be your new Potions teacher. Before I start, I must set a few ground rules for this class. First, I expect all homework to be handed in on time. Next, I expect all students to be dressed appropriately and neatly in my classes. Hair is not allowed to grow past the neck of your robes, and gel is not allowed anywhere on your hair. Also, fringes are not allowed to grow past a maximum of 2 cm, something I posted on all House noticeboards today, and something that this student here seems to have ignored...”  At this he pointed his wand to Matt’s hair. A second and a flash of light later, Cheryl saw that his fringe was gone and the ends of his hair looked extremely frayed. In fact little wisps of smoke seemed to be floating out of them. The whole class laughed, both at the sight of Matt’s hair and the shocked expression on his face.  “You think it’s funny, do you?” Professor Molekiw’s voice said, dangerously soft. “You think it’ll be funny if I did the same to you?” 	 The laughter died immediately.  “You will be sitting for your Ordinary Wizarding Levels this year, and I do not want any of you to fail Potions. In fact I would expect all of you to get an E, if not...” he trailed off, smiling evilly.  “Right. Now, today we will be concocting a Befuddlement Draught. The instructions are on the blackboard. You have one hour. Begin.”  The class set about their potion-making quietly, not daring to do anything that their teacher would disapprove of. Cheryl squinted at the instructions on the blackboard and felt her heart sink. She would probably get befuddled by the instructions even before her potion was finished. She tried to concentrate, weighing out her lionfish spine and ginger roots, but soon found herself looking at a potion that was a bright shade of pink, and not the dark red that was required.   “Add more aardvark bile,” she heard Hu Ping hiss from behind her.   “Thanks,” she muttered, but even before she could reach for her aardvark bile she found herself looking at the disgusting face of Minellus Molekiw.  “Trying to cheat on your potion?” He asked, without waiting for an answer. “Five points from Griffindoor,” he said, eyes glinting. “Oh, and another five points for not following the decree,” he said to Matt, who was now looking murderous. Matt returned to his potion angrily, sending dark red drops of it everywhere.  With five minutes left, Cheryl feverishly stirred the liquid in her cauldron. It was still a bright shade of red, but at least it was no longer pink. She thanked her lucky stars she had Hu Ping behind her.   “Your potion should now be ready,” the voice of Professor Molekiw said. “Cork some in a bottle and leave the sample on the table. You will receive your results next week. In the meantime, write an essay on the uses of aardvark bile in potion-making. I expect no shorter than two feet of parchment. Remember, late homework gets a zero,” he said sardonically.  Cheryl quickly left her sample on the table before rushing out of the room, where she was joined by the others, all with ugly looks on their faces.  “The  nerve ,” Matt sputtered. “My  hair ...”   “It looks great,” Hu Ping replied sarcastically, though Cheryl could see that he too had been disgusted by Molekiw.  “I wasn’t CHEATING!” Cheryl shouted. “What’s his stupid problem?”  “Calm down, people,” Minyu said placidly. “No use getting worked up... though... why did he have to give us TWO feet of parchment?”  “At least it wasn’t three,” Eunice interjected in an extremely happy voice.   The rest stared at her as if she was E.T. Then, they all burst out into loud complaints again.  “...totally an asshole!”  “What’s his problem?”  “TWO feet of parchment!”  As they walked up to their next class, Cheryl couldn’t help but feel that Professor Molekiw would soon get worse.   She would soon be proved right.
