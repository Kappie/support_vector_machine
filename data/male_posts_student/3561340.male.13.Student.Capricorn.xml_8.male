First off, I want to make it clear, Franklin Township School sucks. As of the day that I am posting this, there are only 11 1/2 days remaining, 1 social studies paper, 1 spanish quiz, 1, maybe 2, math tests, and probably 2 science quizes.  And then I will be done with this place! YAYYYYYY! However, I will miss a few students at Franklin. Not many, but a few. I dont think there is any need to indicate who these people are, because you know if Im gunna miss you on not. Now, to get off the topic of my current school, Ill tell you a little bit about Hun.  The Hun School of Princeton is a private school about 45 minutes away from my house. Assuming I am accepted, which I have every reason to be confident about, I will be a boarder there. However, because of those few people that I will miss, I will be coming home most weekends. On the weekends that I stay at school I will probably go into town and hopefully get to spend some time with Alissa, who is an awesome girl. In the fall I am forced to participate in a sport, and Ill probably just end up working out with the basketball or lacrosse team. My parents wont let me play football, which is really gay, and they are trying to make me do crew instead of lacrosse. THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN! Mark my words, I will be playing lacrosse next year, and not crew. As for the classes Im going to be taking, it will probably be something like this: honors algebra, geometry(yes, 2 math classes), honors English, world history, biology, latin 1, and I will be forced to take a health class. My parents want me to get involved in "The Quill," a student newspaper and since i plan on becoming a lawyer, I will probably join the debate club. In other words, Im going to be doing a shitload of work. Sounds like fun, doesnt it! Alright, thats all for now. Peace
