It was almost called off due to another rain...why does it always seem to rain when we play North Vista.?.?.? The umpire didnt want to be known as a (come here get money for free then go) so decided to make the game go on under the heavy rain. I was left with no choice...not to pitch but tossing(hahaha i strike out countless ppl with that...) Bertram felt funny for the team as he always thought Marist do not toss...well...can he pitch in this condition? It was coach's wish to toss...We also fielded many sec 1s except for pitcher, catcher, 3rd base 1st base and centre field....The game ended with a score 14-6
