It can be a little intimidating at first dropping off resumes and applications but I'm on a roll and now I've got momentum. Had my first interview today at The Cactus Club, a place I wasn't evening going to apply to. Come to think of it, West 49 (who called to sched. an interview this morning) was another place that I wasn't going to apply at. I'm like George Costanza right now. Every thought I have is wrong so I should just do the opposite and things will turn out right. More or less. Likely it's just a good lesson in not limiting yourself.  The interview at Cactus Club was another it's a small world story. A manager named Jason interviewed me and when he noticed I had worked at the Delta he asked if I knew Larry from the restaurant because they'd been roommates. How strange. Besides acing the interview with my wit and charm I think that mutual friend thing helped. It'd be really cool to work there too because they've got great food, beautiful waittresses and the tips'd be great. If I could work at West 49 one day a week and work at the Cactus Club a couple nights that'd be killer. Great money and I'd meet alot of great people. I just need to be sure not to overload myself. My meeting tomorrow with an advisor at Cap College will help make that alot clearer when I see what my course/work load will be.  I'm very excited for things right now. I wish I'd had a chance to do more camping and hiking this summer so far but it's not over yet so hopefully I can squeeze a few days in. I have a feeling things are only going to get more rushed and crazy though. I know I can handle it, especially after the insane month I had in March working a full time job, school, moving and snowboarding.  Going to try and catch the finale fireworks on Saturday night. Head downtown and crash at Mary's new apartment. Sorry no pictures yet but I promise after weekend. As long as I can get it to work...  Thanks for the pictures Mom; Randy's baby is really cute, especially the one shot of her drinking juice in front of the fridge. What's with babies these days? Everyone seems to have them. I've probably been out of the loop to long living in neverland (Whistler) having fun to realize they're the new accessory. All my cousins have at least one or even 3! Oh well, I don't need (want) the responsibility. At least not for the next decade.  Cheers everyone! Stay classy and have fun,
