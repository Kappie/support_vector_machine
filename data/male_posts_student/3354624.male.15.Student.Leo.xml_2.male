She said she would put a poster for her campaigne on my locker door. Guess what.. She didn't. Then, she said she would give me candy. What did she do? Not give my candy.:'(.  Then I got kicked out of french class because I'm stupid. It's not fair. She expects us to remember everything she thinks we were taught :@:@:@. Well thats about it. lol.  Right now, I'm talking with people on msn. To be more specific, I'm talking with Jackie, Tasha, and thats all. I'm gonna phone someone. Yes jackie. I'm gonna phone her. lol  Well I'm gonna go.  Later!
