The jam was a knockout! The singer rocked like a Magikiss! The show was supposed to be at Mohawk Place but because of all that Great White stuff the fire marshall had them move it to the Continental. It was the best show I've seen him do by far. He was on a Harmony Joy Ride for sure! He did the hits of course--"Rock and Roll McDonald's," "Cut the Mullet,"--but he unveiled some other stuff like "Michael Jackson," which may be his best song yet (just look up the lyrics), "Osama bin Laden," and the encore, "My Demon is the Devil's Son." They even sounded like different songs this time! He's gotten a lot better. Now he pauses right after he says "Rock Over London, Rock On [Buffalo New York]" so people can cheer before he does his slogan and the ends fade out. It was a success! There were about 100 people at the show! Suddenly, it was over. Just plain awesome.  I would also like to add that the toilets at the Continental are human rights catastrophies. I think there should also be a Toilet Marshall that goes around to bars and clubs to see if they're deadly or not. They're just accidents waiting to have already happened.
