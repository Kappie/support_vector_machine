No doubt i haf faith in her that i'll do beta in promo (i almost type "porno") with her ard, but life seems more tedious as well cos of her higher expectations. but i think i haf qt good impression of her.. she's dynamic n "power"! shit her, onli me has no wksht to do. AM I PART OF THIS CLASS???  haha great joke of the day contributed by elsa : one word to describe janet- "cheez"   ko Sze ROx man, bt he's leaving for Sponge Bob land!! life's great without chong mong teaching me!   love, Ke ai
