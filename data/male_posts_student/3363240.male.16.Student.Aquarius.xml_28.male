I still feel like she is closing herself off to me, but in different ways now. No sympathy, harsh truth. It sucks...because I'm a guy who needs that kind of love. I think that (hypothesis....not in any way meant to offend, or assume) she feels that is she throws over the last wall, which is sympathy, then she will be hurt. I am not that kind of guy. I'm not her ex, and I'm not anyone else. I'm not going to hurt her. I'm going to do everything in my power to  not  hurt her. I don't want to feel this anymore. I feel love everywhere from her, but when we talk on the phone, it changes....I feel like I'm always yakking, with no point. For instance, right now, I'm sitting in complete silence. I'm not talking, and neither is she. It hurt a little. Makes me feel like I'm not worthy to hear about her. Or it makes me feel like she thinks I don't care.  I understand that if my sister is in the room or if something else is going on, I'll be distracted....but the same has happened to me, and I wasn't upset by it. It didn't make me feel like she didn't care, it just made me aware that she was busy. So I waited out the convo between her and her sister to say good bye. It works, and I understand.  I just want to feel like I matter sometimes. And I know, I feel it all the time when we are together. But we do spend a lot of time on the phone, and it feels like I'm yakkin, and unworthy. I hate hearing my voice, especially when I'm not saying anything with meaning. I know silence has meaning, but why have silence you are paying for?  I know I've been mean....but it isn't mean spirits...just joking, cute joking. I'm sorry if I've offended you, and I'm sorry I ditched you the other day.  This isn't any attack, or hate, or anger, or anything. Its just me needing to get something off my chest. I don't feel like talking about it because alas...I don't feel like we would get anywhere.   I love you with all my heart (as I've probably said before) Please acknowledge that I have an open ear, and would like to use it. I'll listen to anything, just the way you do.   I know it seems rediculous to be ranting about phone conversations, but after almost 8 months, it feels like I've done the majority of the talking, and I wasn't saying anything.  All my love. ~Elan  P.S comment, respond, please. I need some form of knowing I didn't offend you. or if I did, I'm sorry, but this needed to come out here, not on the phone. ~~Elan
