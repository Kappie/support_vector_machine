Having seen it, yes it's true; although they are not depicted as blood thirsty animals and such, the jewish leaders are conveyed as ruthless and malicious.  However, I recommend this film to everyone for a number of reasons.  It has a wealth of theoligic information and it's an interesting thing to watch played out in someone else's point of view.  The cinematography is  superb .  Honestly, I would be hard pressed to see a film with better angles, lighting, scenery, it was all just fabulous.  And the last reason is, this is one of the best stories ever told.  I think that fact is often overlooked as people get up to defend their respective religions.  The New Testament is one of the most amazing stories ever told.    Now, the main problem with the film.  But before that can be discussed, the film's title and how it pertains to the film must be appreciated.  The film is meant to depict the passion, the force, the will, the love that was required for Christ to lay down his own life to be taken in such a brutal way.  Remember, it is reiterated in the Gospels that no one had any power over Christ that wasn't given to them by Him--something to remember when you truly stop to think about what Jewish people are actually considered responsible for.  Having explained that, one of the biggest problems with the film is it's gory expression of Christ's torture and crucifixion.  The scenes of torture are relentless, as well as the scenes where Christ carries his cross.  In my opinion, the scenes in the film that truly made me feel the passion of Christ were the delicately filmed flashbacks, showing Jesus teaching, or Him at home with his mother, Mary.  It was sorely unncecessary to film every blow along with it's contacts on His body.  In my opinion, that is the main problem with the film.  Some people will complain about the controversy over the Jews however any intelligent person can understand the fact that according to the Gospels, no one had power over Jesus that Jesus did not give them.  Secondly, it was meant to be for Jesus to perish for the sins of others.  It was not some issue that if Jewish people hadn't been around, we would still have our savior--the whole method of His saving us was by way of His death.  I could sit here and argue this for a long time, but I think I've made my point.  Watch the film, it's an interesting one to say in the least.  I close with a line from the film:  "You are my friends, and the greatest love a person can have for his friends is to give his life for them."
