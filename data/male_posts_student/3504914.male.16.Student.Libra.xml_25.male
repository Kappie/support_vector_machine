Think about it…   Scene : Man and woman in dungeon, leather and chains   Woman : Let me go! *fake screaming*  Man : Bismillah! *pelvic thrust* We will not let you go!  Or   Scene : Man and woman in bedroom, wearing formal garments, perhaps after a wedding and the woman is having second thoughts NOW.   Man : So you think you can love me and leave me to die. *numerous foreplay acts can be inserted here, nipple licking/sucking can be one of them*  Woman : Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby. Just gotta get out, just gotta get out right here *rips clothes off, and if you chose to nipple lick rather than caress, she probably already has her top off*  Sorry, these thoughts cross my mind every so often xD I just like to prove porn can have stories if you try, and that I would obviously change the porn industry if I decided to join it xD  Coincidentally to these thoughts, I was just watching  Coupling , and Steve mentioned the four pillars of heterosexual manhood. " Naked women, lesbians, stockings, and Sean Connery best as James Bond, because that is what being a boy is" . I have yet to meet a guy who isn’t into any of these things xD  In my case, I like all four xD  A little too much information, but by now you should expect things like this to creep in every so often.  An interesting thing came up when I was searching  Coupling  up on Wikipedia. My first result?      Coupling    From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.    Generally, coupling means a    mechanical       connection    between two things. For example    railways       carriages    and    wagons    are coupled together. Other examples of link  coupling  include    clamps   ,    nipples   , and    vices   . Coupling has other specific meanings in physics, electronics, programming and entertainment.      Nipples xD  Now, onto more serious issues…    SUBJECT : MORALITY  There are three kinds of people I can’t stand.   MIMES CLOWNS FANATICS   Now the first two are bastards, but only the last is a cunt bastard.  I’m not talking just about religious fanatics (though they will be what I really hit hard on in a while), but also anti-religion people and anybody who fanatically follows anything.  Now, onto bashing fanatic religious people. I’m sorry I have to do this, but if I keep this bottled up I’m just going to burst.  I fucking hate anybody who can preach one religion so vividly and yet be completely ignorant of other people’s religions to the point where they basically take the piss out of one belief that they find “stupid”.  I fucking hate anybody who can preach religion and yet believe people deserve to suffer because of their people’s mistakes in history.  I fucking hate people who cannot, or will not, question things that are posed to them, and prefer to follow the “I don’t think for myself because that would be too hard, so instead I’ll read this book and just do as it says, oh sheep that I am”.  Look, I respect every religion and every form of practice, even the really odd ones such as those of the College of Thelema, or Rastafarianism. How a person finds belief is up to them, but where it goes to the point where you would be, say, racist to another because a scripture says so, or kill somebody because it says that is the only way to get to Heaven, then it becomes folly.  Books like the Bible, the Koran, etc, they are all guidelines. I honestly don’t believe they are the word of God transcribed, but more the ideas with which one can try and find peace with one self. Morale guidelines. The basic concepts of helping your neighbour (in the sense of helping those around you), not killing other blokes or dames, etc, those are all now embedded within our morality.  Most people KNOW it’s wrong to do these things because of centuries of conditioning to these ideas. Not because we know these things straight off the block, but because these ideas are carried on to us through our parents, our environment, and religion.  Unfortunately, you can also be conditioned badly. You can be taught to accept shit without question, to hate others simply because their skin is a different colour. It’s an unfortunate truth, because with knowledge (and here I rip off Spider-man) “comes great responsibility”.  Humans are gifted in the fact we can usually learn things, and then forget them in favour of higher greatness. I myself have gone through this phase time and time again. I’ve burnt my hand and learned not to touch fire. I’ve learnt, at one time, not to trust people because they can stab you in the back. But in the same way, I learned to trust this isn’t always the case, because of the friendship I’ve managed to find in a unique few.  I used to maintain that religion was one major fallacy, and now I’ve given that up because I know that religion isn’t something that’s physical but more of something we find in ourselves. To error religion for the Church, for the Temples, for the Mosques, would be like mistaking a wolf and a dog. This is to say that on the surface, they share common characteristics.  You can say that religion is the Church because that’s who maintains the faith. But beneath the shell we find that the religious community is made up of people, and it is the faith within these people that makes the difference in that religion.  But here you question that if a person belongs to a religion, they obviously have faith. No, not always. I’ve met my share of people who belong to a religion not of their choosing, but rather of their parent’s choosing.  In this respect, I am lucky. I was brought up Christian, reading the Bible a shitload, then my parents got divorced, and I lost my faith in God, abandoning my religion for all it’s worth. Then I found God when I was in thought about everything that had happened to me, and I was able to build some basic morals off of what had come to pass. Then I read up on Buddhism, and became deeply interested in all the concepts within it.  But I question a lot of things within Buddhism; otherwise I would just be accepting everything like a sheep. To adhere to everything would mean I have to be unconcerned with making money, but I can’t be. I have to try and work hard to make enough money to help my family through school and whatever other travesties that may befall us. I can’t devote everything in my life to help power a cause higher than myself, but I can try.  And this is what I mean by guidelines. I twist and bend them just enough to fit my own reality, not the reality of others who might have been able to do these things. I’m also lucky in the respect that my father is the same as me, and has always encouraged me to always think for myself. He himself is Buddhist, but he has his own guidelines which he follows.  I still pray to God, even though I should pray to Buddha. Why? Because I believe they’re the same. Some figure which exists on a higher plane of knowledge than I do.  The question of how in the Bible God didn’t want us to become more intelligent from eating the apple came up and  somebody  stated that it was because we shouldn’t be as wise as Him. I thought this really stupid. Sorry, I couldn’t help it. The idea of a greater-than-life being, somebody devoid of such feelings as envy or jealousy, thinking we shouldn’t strive to know more is just horridly ridiculous in my mind. For me, my life has been a constant path of knowledge, and I know if people all had the information on what happens in war or murder, it wouldn’t happen. Knowledge has always brought power.  In the Cold War, the world was on the brink of destruction because two nations wanted all. It was knowledge of the extinction of life that let us through that ordeal. If the Premier of the Soviet Union, or the President of the USA, hadn’t known what would happen if they both released the quantity of nukes they had, the world would be rubble.  The issue of reincarnation came up the other day in Asian Studies, and  somebody  (the same  somebody  as above) said something I sincerely felt like killing them for. They said reincarnation was a stupid idea. I felt like strangling that person. To me, Heaven and Hell has always been a silly way of trying to reach a better state. The whole idea is to work to live in a place where all is good.  Reincarnation as preached in Buddhism is so that as we work ourselves to be better, we may eventually attain Enlightenment, and with this we can help others. It isn’t as selfish as the quest for the individual but is for the betterment of everybody. Sure it seems silly, and you may never think it will happen, but doing things because you want to help others seems like a better way to approach a peaceful state of mind than for your own privilege.  I really better stop xD If anybody has any sensible opinions which don’t involve bias as to how I constantly seem to take the piss out of the Church or religion in general, please comment. The only reason I use the Church is because it’s the only one I have any familiarity with, and I don’t have the right to condemn things I don’t know enough about.
