The conclusion came about after the   hamburger grill broke, meaning "FRED" had to explain that burgers were not for   sale.  "I made signs that said, 'NO BURGERS - GRILL BROKEN'" commented "FRED." What   more did I need to do? Is everyone dumb?"  It is estimated that 1 in 2 customers had receive a personal explanation of   what the signs meant, while 1 in 5 needed to learn that the "Whopper" was a   kind of burger and hence unavailable. Also, 1 in 8 pointed to the signs and   asked "Does that mean there are no burgers?"  After two hours, "FRED" got really frustrated. "After two hours I got really   frustrated," he recalled, "so I made MORE signs. I even drew big X's on sheets   of paper and put them over the pictures of all the food on the menu. Do you   think that helped? NO!"  Justifiably so, many customers were also quite upset at the situation. One   became visibly angry. "What do you mean there are no burgers?!" the woman   yelled before she stomped away. "I've been waiting in line for 20 minutes!   The LEAST you could do is put up a sign!"  In an unrelated story, "FRED" is continuing to tell himself he has a career   future outside of Burger King and is only working there to help pay for   college.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * INFLATIBLE CHURCH!

We are here out of basic necessity. Let's make the   best of the situation. We are all here by choice no one is forcing us to be   here. Why don't we stop worrying about what we can't change? Let's not worry   about everyone else, lets concentrate on our selves and how we can do the best   work we can do to earn that money that is letting us survive. In the scheme of   things let's be glad that we are surviving. Let's all make the best of our   work environment. Let's be happy to be here each day. And be glad that the   others are able to be here too.  Going into summer lets decide to make it a good one, and remember to be happy,   it doesn't do any good to be sad or mad, be glad."

And why not? Not   only is our dear Maria a bright shining face in a sea of middle-aged, balding   male financial experts, she's also a Rock Chick! Fun fact: Joey Ramone wrote a   song about her on his last solo album. Look it up!   "One of my hobbies is the stock market," Ramone said in March 1999. His   fascination at the time was a daily financial analysis program on cable station   CNBC.  "I watch this show Squawk Box every morning, and they have this host named   Maria [Bartiromo] who is really hot and feisty," Ramone said. "When I stopped   drinking, I started getting into the stock market because it's sort of like a   mosh pit down there."  A demo of the song mixes the British Invasion sound of the Who's early material   with a touch of the Ramones' career-long fascination with Motown girl groups.   "I watch her every day/ I watch her every night/ She's really out of sight/   Maria Bartiromo," Ramone sings.  Hey Maria, you can ring MY "opening bell" any day! Also, it's good we found a   new Anchorette Centerfold because the one for May--Linda Stouffer of Headline News--gave   birth a couple weeks ago and will be on maternity leave for a while. Honest,   it's not mine. Congrats Linda, and congrats Maria! We just want to say Good   Luck, and We're all counting on you.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  QUOTES IN FUTILITY, PART TWO  "I don't think the system is 100% effective; I mean, it can't as long as the   human element is involved." --Jury Duty orientation video, City of Buffalo
