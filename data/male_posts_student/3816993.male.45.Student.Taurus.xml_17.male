Of course given that today is the 4th of July doesn’t hurt the efforts of self-reflection either.   I read an interesting post by  urlLink Hugo Schwyzer  regarding patriotism. Despite his progressive politics he finds that he swells with patriotic pride on the 4th.  And yet, for me, it is a day of ambivalence. I was a kid during the turbulent late-1960’s. I remember when it was a joke to be patriotic for the United States. In fact, while watching Michael Moore’s film  urlLink Farenheit 9/11 , I wondered if his film would have been hooted and howled at if it had been shown back in the late-1960’s. For example, Moore makes certain to not cast too much blame on the rank and file soldier. There is an underlying theme of patriotism, which is in evidence when Moore asserts that the policies of the Bush Administration are undermining what makes the U.S. great. It is as if Moore were attempting to grab the feeling of being patriotic back from the (almost exclusive) clutches of the conservatives.  My gal-pal  urlLink Teresa  recently observed that one of the main legacies of President Reagan was that he made being patriotic respectable again in the United States. (I guess quite a number of pundits lauded the same thing during the week of mourning after President Reagan's death, but I hadn’t paid much attention given that I didn’t remember his time in office as being quite so glorious. On the other hand, I’d much rather have President Reagan back in office than this present administration.)  Nonetheless, I remain ambivalent about being patriotic on this year’s 4th. Given my strong disagreement with President Bush’s international policies, the “pre-emptive” strike doctrine, and his insistence on courting the Religious Right, I don’t feel so proud to be an American. Every time I visit  urlLink Iraq Body Count   I shudder; and this “only” lists the range of casualties amongst civilians: it doesn’t list soldiers killed or all those, whether military personnel or civilian, who have been maimed and/or traumatized by the war.
