Common Tests and exams are coming.. and there are about 2 modules which i am not confident of passing.. that is my Chemistry.. and Horticulture Enginerring which is about pressure measurements.. something a little like physics.. but more tougher.. more complicated.. haiz..  I just do not want history to repeat itself..  But i guess i'll just keep on trying huh?.. Let's just hope for the best..  Now i'm feeling the pressure.. projects due soon.. common tests, exams around the corner.. and i'm nowhere near..
