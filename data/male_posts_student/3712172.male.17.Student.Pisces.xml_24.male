I guess I should make this post short as I have to get up early, I work a 10.5 hour shift tomorrow and I need to be energized. 10.5 hours, it's fucking long, but good money. So I think I will try to be positive. Even though my day goes to waste, but ah well :)  The smoking thing is going alright, I cut down more today. Today's cigarettes go as follows:    1) 10:25 AM    Morning Smoke    Routine  2) 10:58 AM    After Eating Smoke    Routine  3) 11:17 AM    Smoke Before Work - Filling A Craving / Lasting Until Break  4) 2:03 PM    Break Smoke    Routine  5) 4:24 PM    Break Smoke    Routine  6) 6:04 PM    Break Smoke    Routine  7) 8:08 PM    After Work Smoke / Filling The Craving  8) 8:57 PM    At Computer / Bored / Craving  9) 10:29 PM    Craving / At Computer    A tenth cigarette will probably be added to that list before I fall asleep. It all depends though, maybe I will try to cope without it :)  Ah well, besides all of that I am fairly tired and I don't have too many ideas of what to type tonight. I think I am going to call it a night. Expect some more interesting words soon to come :)  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Night All!
