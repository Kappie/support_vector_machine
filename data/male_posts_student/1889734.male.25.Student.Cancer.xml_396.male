That means I am moving toward the rewrite phase, where I will need readers to help keep me on track, as I had mentioned before.  I've been thinking about how to do this.  One idea is to initiate a new Blog, independent of this one, and post the segments of the story there.  The comment sections will serve as a review mechanism, with the added benefit of you guys being able to react to each others comments, and perhaps help me strengthen the story through any conversations that might take place.    The other method is to dispatch Word files every day or so to each of you via email, with return comments coming back the same way.    Those that plan on participating: do you have a preference?  As I have said, I appreciate any help you care to lend.
