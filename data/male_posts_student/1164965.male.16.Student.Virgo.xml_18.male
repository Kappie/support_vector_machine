I couldn't help but get past the idea that, if Jim were really worried about getting away from slavery and afraid for his life, he wouldn't jump through all the hoops for Tom's perfect scheme. I felt it was a little unrealistic; it's natural instinct to run when given the chance -- just like if a dog were to get free, he wouldn't sit around and wait for the perfect getaway. He'd just get out of there! Did anyone else feel anxious while reading this part in the book, or is it just me?
