Well, how about this...I'm taking a group of people to the White Settlement Health Fair tomorrow for our Texas Medical Association group. That'll be cool. No? Well how about this. Last week I went out to the Fox and Hound bar downtown for the first time with a couple friends. I actually had about 4 drinks, which is more than I've had in quite some time. We spent a good amount of time trashing some of our more annoying classmates.   There's some way I'm supposed to be able to put pictures on this biotch, but I don't know how just yet. Oh, I just remembered something I can write about. For the last week we've been learning about the well-man and well-woman exams. These include breast, genital and rectal exams. Next week I will be doing all of those for the first time. We will actually be doing these exams on real patients, which is a huge deal to any first year med student like myself. I mean, huge as in a little nerve racking, yet intriguing at once. Seriously, how many times in your life does a normal person feel cervixes, prostates, and whatnot? That's really all I can think of. Peace out, fools.   Songs of the day   Heart of Gold , Neil Young, 1972.  Bigger Than My Body , John Mayer, 2003.
