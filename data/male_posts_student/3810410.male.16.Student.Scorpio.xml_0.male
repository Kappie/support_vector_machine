Cause I've given up on all senseless reason I've given up on acts of indiscretion Go ahead and kill me once more Just another way you show your perfection... I had a burden of giving you what you wanted I had a load of receiving your complaints But the measure of this world can’t compare to this Cause it can’t outweigh all my pain Go ahead, keep it all in, never give out before you go Go away, keep all those thoughts, never gave me the time of day What is really going on right now? You tell me that nothing is wrong, but I can tell that all is You try to change the subject, but one thing is only on my mind What is wrong? Was it something I said? Go ahead, keep secrets from me, I’ve never kept any of mine from you Go away, keep your wounds, I thought we would say it all upfront  What is really going on today? You claim you are busy, and can’t be disturbed It’s like you have another life, and I am unaware and unwelcome to it Well guess that’s the life we’ve made Guess that’s the games we play But it’s like I always lose and I can never win So I think today I will quit before I can begin Goodbye, goodbye Always hated leaving first, but now I fear the worst  So long, so long Always hate to admit it, but I can not forget it  I’m leaving now, better stop me before I go The doors getting closer and I just hate to leave Hello.
