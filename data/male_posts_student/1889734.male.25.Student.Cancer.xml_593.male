We're in the snack bar, and someone is there setting up Pfizer logo clothing and accessories, exhibiting the merchandise now available for purchase.  I point it out, and mention I'd like to go take a look.  This guy then replies, "Back when I was a professional fisherman..."    The rest of the his words were lost to me as I pondered what he had just said.  "Excuse me?"  So he tells me about his days as a pro fisher and how he would get boxes of logo merchandise, a free bass boat, fuel and so on.  I gained an insight on the insanely competitive world of fishing as he regailed me with stories of treachery, gamesmenship and victory.  I guess I never expected to meet a pro fisherman working in a pharmaceutical plant.  I'm now on a quest to find a Bocce Champion.
