Scott, who earned the right to use the Power of Veto, didn't use it. The women formed a all-female alliance, and the four horsemen found out thanks to Will. *POSSIBLE SPOILER*.........................So, who is the twin? According to my cousin, Adria has a twin named Natalie, and they're playing as one player in the Big Brother House.   Last Comic Standing:  Once again, Gary Gulman had to go head to head with another comic. However, he came out a winner... again! Gary defeated Jay London in the head to head match, once again proving that he deserved to be in the final five. The show seems a lot more exciting now that Ant was defeated. Everyone seems to be voting for whom they truly believe they are more funnier than. The problem I had with Ant is that he wanted people to vote in an alliance, and that's truly a bore. The comics had to perform in front of children. Kathleen Madigan won immunity, performing as a leperchaun. And the remaining comics got a new dog named Rusty! Kathleen took an instant liking to Rusty. The remaining comics were giving Rusty cold pizza and other foods a dog might enjoy. John complained that the dog is getting fed better than he himself is.   Anyways, next week, the eliminated contestants come back to haunt the remaining contestants! The returnees include: Bonnie McFarlane, Todd Glass, Ant, and, of course, Jay London. Do they want sweet revenge, or do they just want to make things MORE difficult for the remaining comidiennes? I wonder...   Anyways, I'll write more on Friday... the day after the first eviction on BB5.
