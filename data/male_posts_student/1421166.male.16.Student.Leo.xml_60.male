Anyway, it's "A walk to remember" by Nicholas Sparks. I was just so...so...affected by it(don't know how to describe the feeling), I just had to come online to talk about it. It's a beautiful story. It's hard to put down. But I wonder if this could be true...it's just to amazing.   It's almost like a perfect love story. A young one that is. Landon Carter is a young boy seventeen. He grew up in a rich family. He could be a horrible spoilt boy in Beaufort town. But when he fell in love with this almost perfect and angelic girl, Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the Baptist Minister, he's life changed. I haven't read finish the book. In fact, I only read until the part he realised his feelings for her. But still, it invoked many thoughts...   Landon was wondering how he ever fell in love with someone like Jamie. And suddenly, somethings in the past just struck me again. To be honest, I've fallen in love before...if that's what you'll call it.(what a confession...) In fact, I believed that every single one of you is reading this would have fallen in love too. But how? Love isn't blind, we are told. It has to be based on something. But it's so hard to comprehend. Some people say infatuation. Makes me wonder why people fall in love in the first place. They say, or I used to say, that love in your teens can't be taken serious? But that of Landon and Jamie's was everlasting(according to synopsis). I wonder if the story is true. Can this ever happen. Are that not even a little true love in teenage love?   So many people talk about the young love story that happened in their lives. But what is it that they cherished from this that they never forgot? Maybe each of us have our own "a walk to remember". Would the sweet smile of my or your childhood sweetheart still remain vivid ten years down the road?   I do not know why I'm writing this. Maybe all I want to do is write or rather type it out. But what if all these is wrong? What if all these sweet memories were just unconcious desires of us to feel loved? Isn't it scary? What is the love of your life about? What is it that you really share with the one you love? And along with these, what is our love for God about? What is God's love for us about? I sincerely hope that none of you reading this have missed the point of true love. Maybe if you have, this might be the time to sort it out. And to my brothers and sisters in Christ, have we missed the point of God's love for us the same way? If we have, then our love for God would have to thoroughly evaluated.   Bless you my friends, that God might teach you something.
