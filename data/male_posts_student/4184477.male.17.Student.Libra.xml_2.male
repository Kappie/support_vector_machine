When I was playing 'pretend' when I was in late primary/early secondary school, it was always the same character, Hermes, and later his seven companions. I began this story, but found that the range of characters were difficult (for me, at least) to put across without the page becoming crowded. Though I had reams of paper relating to this novel, I figured it might be better to try something a little easier, at least to begin with.  Therein lies my problem. I have a main character, Oliver, in mind. He is short, 5'5 to 5'9, with blond hair brushing his shoulders and a toned body (strong but not Olympic/Arnie level). Regardless, I've worked out that he doesn't believe in anything beyond the end of his nose. He is a journalist or writer or some sort and may well be an orphan. However, Oliver is oblivious to the preternatural world, which exists in common knowledge but not officially, yet is a part of it through his blood. I need him to be some sort of creature, yet I can't pin it. He can't be a vampire or lycanthrope, as the disadvantages of the species would have affected him by now. I'll think of something.  That's all for now. Have to pop off. See you soon!
