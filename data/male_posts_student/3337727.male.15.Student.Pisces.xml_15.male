We talked about lots of things, like what's he's been doing these past few weeks, Chobits, relationships, the tie of the Gnotism religion and FFX, everything. I'm certainly having fun talking with him, and my conversation goes on with him, as of this writing.   And I got to talk with Ali late last night, which was really good..I had spent about two days without talking to her, unless you count her text message convos which only lasted a few minutes. It was so fun talking to her..and a bit romantic, hehe.
