I tried to help and dialed 999.  Only for the phone to go...beep beep beep The number you have dialled has not been recognized.  Eventually I got thourgh to the emergency services by phoning the local police station.  However, the ambulance men then said that the street we were on didn't exist.  And then Micheal died.......
