I counted 21 dumb comments to 5 useful ones. Two of the useful ones pointed out grammar errors in the book.  Teacher: "Delores, what answer did you get for number 4?"  Delores: "False?"  Teacher: "That's correct."  Delores: "Oh. So it's true?"  Teacher: "No, you're right."  Delores: "Why isn't it False? I put down False."  Teacher: "The answer IS False. Maybe I misspoke. I'm sorry."  Delores: "Alrighty. So it's False then?"  Teacher: "YES."  Delores [talking to herself too loudly]: "So that's number . . . 4."  [class rolls eyes]
