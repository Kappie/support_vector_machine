Well since my cousin is back in msia again and he usually works out there i thought i would tag along with him for once. Turns out to be a pretty nice place with very good facilities, not to mention one or two good looking girls along the way.. I actually predicted that i was gonna feel like i'd just been wasted or somethin, and sure enough when i woke up this morning my arms and abs were hurting like s*it. Up till now i cant move my arms around properly.. to think that im actually going back there tomorrow is not comforting. My cousin is probably gonna be merciless on me and stretch me to the limit again.. Siiighhh i guess im supposed to grin and bear it...?   In school my exam results are coming back bit by bit, and the results so far have NOT been encouraging. With my friends beating me by a lot of marks even in my stronger subjects, i hate to think what the end result is gonna be like.. Oh well i suppose theres still a bit more time to go and all hope isnt lost yet, but with each passing day the deadline just gets closer.. its like as if the walls are closing in on you... or maybe im just exagerrating a bit too much.... my "adopted" family seems to be increasing in school though(yea u know who u are), its really gonna get a bit complicated soon but hey its all good fun right? besides not like we're gonna be seeing much of each other after this year, so might as well make the most of it while we're all still around.   Watched Spiderman 2 on sunday and my overall review is two thumbs up!! Fight scenes are better then ever and peter's personal relationships are developed nicely. Only complaint i hve is about the ending.. i wish they had put the part about hob goblin a bit closer to the end so the main story wouldnt end so soon, but apart from that everything else was great. Its actually quite interesting how u can learn a few moral values even from watching a movie adapted from a comic book like spiderman.. goes to show the learning process never ends ^^   A few sports events have recently concluded too. Wimbledon tennis(Maria Sharapova RocKs!!), Euro 2004(Greece really did it..), F1(Schumacher wins again! Micheal of course..) and of course not forgetting the Malaysian Open badminton tournament where our msian men won both the singles and doubles title. But then again whos been following badminton lately anyway..? I hope not many ppl are too heartbroken over Portugal's loss to Greece, i suspect a few might hve even cried along with Ronaldo hahaha.   Finally this is to wish Joanne goodluck in her upcoming dance competition.. hope u mix some nice songs girl!! ^^
