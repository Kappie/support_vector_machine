(shrugs) who knows. so, marching with the drumline-niceness, getting into technique blocks which im sure you all have noticed some people desperately need it. i dunno, for me these marching blocks have been wierd, but that just could be because i've never rehersed without karlin, or amistoso or ian or andres running things....i miss those guys. they taught me everything i know.....now im sad. oh well whatever. new marching guy, charles told me about him, cool guy from what he said. yeah then we met him today, cool guy. music block, hmmm........hmmm......damn, ive already tried to say something here twice and it hasnt worked out cause it just comes out wrong. ok-think of something funny and cynical here but mostly funny and most importantly not offensive, insert it here, and say to yourself "man that christina. shes a funny one". man, im really bad at group blogs, especially ones like this cause i always end up offending people, and im really REALLY trying to not do that as always. but have patience, one day i will have this stroke of genius and will think up the perfect blog and will get out all i want to say.  i had a crappy rehersal today. i mean, i was floating a little while we were marching but id still screw up, and then during music (sigh) my jaw would just not open (i mean come on-my mouth refuses to open what the hell is that????) and also it was obvious that ive been slacking off my practicing which, i mean i know im gonna get back on the good routine but ahhhh i know better than that....heeheehee got a little bit of a belly tan :)
