I dropped off a present for a friends kid, picked up a friend gave him a ride and then went to the dry cleaners. Then I came home. Exciting huh?? So I sat around the house all day talked to people on-line including my sister from Brazil. Man I miss her we had some good times. Como un dia quando nos foi jogar verdage o desefio. Well isn't it a good thing none of you can understand portuguesse. I actually wish someone here did so I could have fun talkin another language around people that don't understand. Well I did all that and then had tacos for dinner mmm!! So yeah that was my day. So yeah nothing is happening in my life that would amaze anyone. You know what though I'm happy with it though. You are asking your self why right. Well My normal american life is all I need. Of course my life ain't perfect but, hey it could be a lot worse. All I need now is a woman, to get decent grades in school, and to havea great senior year. I don't think that's to much to work for. So I will do it to it and wish you luck as well.  Remember:Never be satisfied with average.
