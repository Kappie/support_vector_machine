I spent the weekend with one of the most awesome girls I have ever met (Kari, Kendra, and Karen (wow, all K's) not included in that statement, cause they're awesome too). Her name is Jessica Aubry, and I met her two years ago at Summit Grove Camp. I haven't seen her since. We've just kep in touch.  I met her mom and step-dad Friday and we went out bowling. It was fun. Dave (step-dad) is wicked awesome at bowling. I was good, but not nearly as good as I used to be. Guess who is going more often to work up his game! :) After that, Dave, Val, and Jess met my parents. Dave, Val, and the parentals talked for an hour while Jess and I hung out more.  Saturday, Dave, Val (Jess' mom), Jess, and I went to the  urlLink National Aquarium in Baltimore . It was fun. After that, we went back to her hotel to go swimming in the pool-like wading pool they call a pool. It was fun. That whole day Jess and I had tickle fights. After swimming, we hung out in her room playing games (Backgammon and stuff) until I went home, and Dave and Val talked to the parentals again for about an hour.   Sunday, Jess hung out here, and we played card games and then went for a walk around my neighborhood. After we came back, Dave, Val, Jess, the parentals, my sister Laura, and I all went out to Golden Corral for lunch and then they left. I went to church that night and didn't get home until late. I had a great time, but it left no time for other friends or the bloggie. Hope you understand. It really was worth it.   I am not saying that Jess and I will get together or anything, but I really do like her... and I have evidence including some off-side comments she has said to prove she really likes me as well. Keep an eye on this one. You'll hear more about Jess in the months to come.  Notable: I forgot to mention that the Edgewood High School newspaper has been put on the web, and if you so choose, you can read my articles on the page. It is at: urlLink ehsnews.blogspot.com .  Also notable, while I was on leave of absense, if you want to call it that, a very nice girl/lady named Nancy came across my blog, added it to her Christian blog listing at  urlLink http://journals.aol.com/sftrail/SheepBlog/ , and asked me to do a guest commentary on some bible passages for  urlLink http://todaysbible.lifewithchrist.org . I will post links to my commentaries when they are published.  Anyway, don't have long. More to catch up on. Next stop,  urlLink Twice Double Forums  and then surprising Kari with a phone call. Blog ya later! God bless!  In Christ, Mike >  "What is past is prologue."- What is Past is Prologue statue in Washington D.C. (Basically means, "You ain't seen nothing yet!")
