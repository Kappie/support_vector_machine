Come to think of it, I think I'll move (probably just copy) the Acne and AIM Away Messages posts to this blog. Anyway, moving onto the post...  I was just taking a shower an half-hour ago or so and was reminded of an irrelevant rant I meant to make a while ago about the plumbing of the apartment complex in which I live. It seems that all the hot and cold water pipes are linked together or something because whenever someone in THE WHOLE BUILDING (it's just like 20 apartments, but still) flushes a toilet, turns on the shower, or even does so much as use the sinks, there's either a HUGE spike in temperature that results in the occasional burn and almost guaranteed high volume, high pitched scream of agony or there's a huge drop in temperature that usually results in a loud, low-toned grunt.  Speaking of extremely uncomfortable hot water, in this last shower, I experienced pain that I didn't know could be felt by only hot water. The shower that I use has the water come out at an ungodly high pressure. I mean, the pressure is so high that if you have a pimple on your forehead and you put your face under the water and the main stream of water hits it, it hurts as if you smashed your head against a wall or table. Anyway, I was taking my shower and the water temperature spiked and I happened to be turning in such a way (I think I was getting the body wash) that the stream was aimed at that special place. There is no word to better describe the pain felt than a monotonically said "Ouch*." I'd say it hurts worse than spilling hot coffee on yourself.  I think I've gone into more than enough detail, but here's the point: If you're a guy, learn how to avoid this situation and situations like this. If you're a girl and are considering doing some kind of practical joke on your ex or plan on ending your current relationship, setting him up with hot liquids is just not the way to do it. It's cruel and unusual punishment.  What did I tell ya? Pretty pointless and irrelevant, eh?  That is all. -- Feanor  * Followed by screams, shouts, some expletives, and the victim waving his arms around ridiculously trying to get it off.
