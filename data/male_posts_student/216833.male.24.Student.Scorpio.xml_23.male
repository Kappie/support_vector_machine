Cars don't go unless you fill them with dino-blood and start them, lives dont live until you kick them in the ass.  So when is someone going to kick me in my ass.    Thing to start again by the end of the week.    Lift weights (becuase I need to be mean)   Study my cisco books regularly and get to the goal of a cert.   Find a place for wuornos to practice   Eat better for the fucking sake of staying alive.    I dunno why I just can't do these things.  Fuck it.  Tomorrow I am going to do what I want, not what my weak ass mind gets away with but what I want.   You can't have it all you say, well, I can if I make myself.  Its going to be hard.  But I guess instead of pussing out and getting fat and poor, I'll stop being a light weight and do it!   Updates coming soon!  Man, losing friends makes things go weird....I'm way to dependant on people....from now on its me and I don't care if you don't like me.
