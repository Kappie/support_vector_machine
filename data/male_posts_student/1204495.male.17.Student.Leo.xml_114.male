Let her cry?if the tears fall down like rain Let her sing?if it eases all her pain Let her go?let her walk right out on me And if the sun comes up tomorrow Let her be?let her be.  This morning I woke up alone found a note standing by the phone saying baby, maybe I?ll be back some day I wanted to look for you You walked in I didn?t know just what I should do so I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself.  Saying... Let her cry?if the tears fall down like rain Let her sing?if it eases all her pain Let her go?let her walk right out on me And if the sun comes up tomorrow Let her be?let her be.  Ah.....ah.....oh...oh... No..no..no..no...  Let her cry?if the tears fall down like rain Let her sing?if it eases all her pain Let her go?let her walk right out on me And if the sun comes up tomorrow Let her be?Ah-ah...  Last night I tried to leave cried so much  I could not believe she was the same girl I fell in love with long ago She went in the back to get high I sat down on my couch and cried yelling oh mama please help me won?t you hold my hand.  And... Let her cry?if the tears fall down like rain Let her sing?if it eases all her pain Let her go?let her walk right out on me And if the sun comes up tomorrow Let her be?  Let her cry?if the tears fall down like rain Let her sing?if it eases all her pain Let her go?let her walk right out on me And if the sun comes up tomorrow Let her be...oh...let her be.
