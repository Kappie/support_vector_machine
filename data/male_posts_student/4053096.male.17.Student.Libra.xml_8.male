By the end I was exausted. I slept till nearly four in the afternoon today... and I'm still tired; well, sorta. It's most likely just because I had slept that long. Played some mean Halo. Won half of the games that I played in. Got second in the rest. I helped Kenneth and Seth out when they were playing. I think I play that game way too good. They kept saying it was suicide to play against the Skippers. I probably shouldn't play it as much as I do, but hey; it's a really fun game. Oh well. That's enough typing for now. I have to get ready to go to eat at Zaxby's. I love David, he always manages to convince the parents to eat out. Well, that's not the only reason I love my bro, but yeah.
