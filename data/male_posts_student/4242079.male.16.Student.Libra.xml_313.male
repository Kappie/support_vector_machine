I've noticed since I've started typing this, that my fingers seem not to be co-operating, and I have been using the backspace key about twice as much as usual. So, I will wait until the morning, even though it's a fact that most people write better during the early morning hours. Just look, I am not saying anything and I've managed to fill up a few lines of space. More shit to sit on Blogger and Tripod's servers. Note the proper use of the apostrophe.  I will update tomorrow about: My night at the bar and Sonja Hehli. and Why blogs are important for the world.
