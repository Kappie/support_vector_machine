My sister walks in to my room, drunk off her ass and starts yelling at me about who knows what. So, I get up and she pushes me. I fall down and break my glasses. My brand new 250 dollar glasses. That's not all, it's far from over. My girlfriend calls me and she tells me that she's going to Arizona for two weeks. So the whole day, I'm completely bummed out.. I figure I'll take a nice scorching hot shower. I get in, and the water is freezing cold. To top it all off my mom announces that she thinks she's pregnant. She can't be pregnant, right? I hope to god this is a false alarm. I'm so irritable, I want to shoot myself in the face.  ________________________________________________________  EDIT: Can the real HJ please stand up?
