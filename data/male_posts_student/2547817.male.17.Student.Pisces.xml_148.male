And so, survivor begins again. The difference is, that this time, I'm not going to give a damn about playing.  A poem requires danger or death to be successful.  Jolyn is still angry at me and I'm very upset about that. She's not answering my messages or calls. This sucks. I really don't want this to turn out like the conventional saga. I love Jolyn.  It's almost not funny to write about this anymore after the last paragraph, but I'll do it anyway. Just that it won't be funny. I got splashed by spluttering oil at the steam-boat today and I exclaimed "BISMILlAH" out of the blue. (Pardon me my Muslim buddies). It WAS rather funny though. Also, we got a bad position, and I happened to be getting the brunt of the chain reaction. Food cooks --> smoke is produced --> smoke rises --> smoke suffocates sandflies attracted to bright light above my seating position --> extra protein in my food and drink (yummy).   Astro and I then proceeded to burn the food we couldn't finish so that we wouldn't be charged for wastage and we walked back to the MRT station for the next 20 minutes. We picked up big sticks which had fallen off the trees with the initial intention of them being protection from the wild dog packs (the road was dark and lonely you see). HOWEVER, being ASTRO AND MYSELF, coupled with our fascination for TERRORISM (which ONLY arises in me when we are together), we turned the protective sticks (about 1.5m in length) into guns. We hid beind bushes and jumped out at oncoming cars wielding our large sticks (ok. That sounded wrong) yelling in Arabic- sounding Xena the warrior princess like shrieks. It was liberating and I was happy. And on the LRT home, we intentionally had a heated, VERY AUDIBLE conversion about how things were "not working out"  about how "he's found someone else" and that we should "break up". OH my GOSH! You should have seen the look on the other passengers faces! I really miss hanging with Astro.   I got off the train with a soft caress from him which I reciprocated with great pleasure.
