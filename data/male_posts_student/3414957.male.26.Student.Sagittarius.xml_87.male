Before, I used to actually talk with people here but then they didnt know when to stop talking and stay out of your own conversations with someone else.    Wowsa wowsa. I got that song in my head that makes me laugh by the Rolling Stones,  urlLink She's So Cold!   It reminds me of my situation. :-)  It's funny, life that is. But its funny in that cruel ironic way.
