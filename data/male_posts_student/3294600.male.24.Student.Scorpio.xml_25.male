I probably won't pour out my heart and soul as much since I realized this is found on Google under my name.  School during summer is the pits. I would rather have it be a full quarter than try to stuff 12 weeks of information into 8. It's a lot of work and my brain can't handle all the information so quickly. Overall, I'm doing pretty well in spite of it. Logic is a bit much, but I am just aiming to get out of it with a C or better. My schedule is nice only having classes Monday through Thursday.  I've been a little frustrated lately by people on-line and the continued shallowness. It gets old after a while and I can only take so much rejection. If even I were comfortable with my body, others wouldn't be and it doesn't matter. If anyone on-line does show interest, it seem to only be for sex and that's not really what I want. I'm good enough for a fuck, but not good enough to date. *sigh* Sorry, I'm bitching...  I so can't wait for hockey to start in September. I'm so excited and the more I hear about the upcoming season the more I can't wait.  Hmm...what else is going on? Not much really. Just school and school work.  Got a kick out of:  urlLink http://www.JibJab.com  a couple nights ago. I couldn't stop watching it and laughing. I love it. There is another site I can't remember at the moment that is hella funny with a squirrel named Foamy.  Check it out and let me know what you think...I'll try to find Foamy again. :) My favorites are "Small, Medium, Large" and "Fatkins".  Anyway, I'm signing off for now, it does feel good to write. I miss writing, it's one of my favorite things to do (besides cuddling with someone).  Peace!  Jason
