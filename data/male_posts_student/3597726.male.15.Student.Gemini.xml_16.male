Isaac drove me down to his apartment in New Brighton. I watched this crazy sweet guy with horns all over his body who would play likie classical music by turning his head and squeezing his armpits and stuff...yeah, it was pretty crazy. There was also this girl who could do the stacking cup thing in 8.2 seconds! It was insane. Anyway, since the Vanderplaats were in town, at the wards house, all these people came over to hang out. Isaac and Noah showed off a pretty impressive set of fireworks, while Ben shot hhis bottle rockets off into the trees. The best news of the day was definatly the fact that the Essigs and Dan got back safely! I guess Dan didn't get much sleep, cuase he's in bed right now. I can't wait to here what all of them have to say about the trip. Also, today was Leah's birthday! Happy Birthday, Leah!   Not much else going on. I'll post more if I feel like there's anything worth posting...
