Miss Taylor hovered around James momentarily for some chocolate as we finished off the first pieces of our coursework.  RE was just mad.  Physics wasn't that good ebcause we just did a practice test.  Information systems was particularly 'ready salted' also. In fact, not one lesson today made the 'cheese and onion' or 'salt and vinegar' title   I was feeling a bit down at dinner time for some reason.  Maybe it was the sudden change in weather from sunny to cloudy and windy.  Ignore me please.  I have just been writing the first paragraph of my new story and my brain is bashind around in my head trying to break free.  Here is a taster paragraph:   James continued down the corridor, not noticing all of the stares he was receiving from other hospital staff, and jogged up a flight of stairs.  He passed the first floor waiting room and almost exactly the same thing happened as downstairs.  Every single person waiting suddenly stopped talking and gawped at him.  A baby somewhere in the room suddenly started chuckling.  He was about to say something when Jennifer appeared around the corner, let out a short scream and dropped the small cup of tea she was just holding, “James!  What the hell have you done?!”   I'll leave it to your imaginations.  Anyway, me Sam and Craig might have a sleepover this weeked.  I stress the word might because 9/10 of the times, there isn't a sleepover after all.  I'm going to bed now before my head actually explodes and I can't stay awake without falling asleep (rather like the main character in my story actually  )  I'll leave you with a few pictures I made today.  They hold the theme "Why you shouldn't put your picture on the internet", and are of Sam and james mwaha!  Here you go:   Sam... Engorged!   James the Porn Star   Wallace and... Sammit   'Shrek' and Donkeh!   Toy Story Sam   Sam of Liberty   Hahahahahaha... sorry Sammo, couldn't resist
