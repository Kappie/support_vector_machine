Then... all is quite As quickly as they had come, they are gone They have moved on to the next house down the street However I know they will be back But for now... Peace Ithen drift asleep to the steady pitter-patter of the storm that has passed...  this is a poem I wrote while I was by myself in the middle of a thunderstorm with high winds and lots of rain. It was suppose to mean that there was something outside in the storm trying toget in, butI have realized itcan be interpretted many ways. The day after I wrote this someone broke into our house.
