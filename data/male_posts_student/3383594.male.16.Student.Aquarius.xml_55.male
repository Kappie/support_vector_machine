I do not believe a team frm nowhere, who had nvr taken part in big tournaments, who were the most underdogs of the underdogs, could turned out to be the winners. Tt's juz bullshitz! I was frustrated and juz pissed bout' it. I honestly felt tt Greece was juz plain lucky. To defeat big teams like France, Czech Republic and Portugal, to draw wif a rather good team like Spain and to lose to a lousy team like Russia, now doesn't tt sound fake? Well, it definitely does to me.  I went to watch Spider Man 2 at West Mall in the afternoon wif some frens. We actually wanted to catch the 3:30pm slot. Well, we were in the queue like 3:15pm all the way to 3:45pm. The queue was so damn long, it was like all the way to the "Yellow" shop. Well, when it was our turn to get tickets, both 3:30pm as well as 4:00pm timeslot were fully taken. So we decided to get the 4:30pm timeslot. There were also many seats already taken up and we didnt manage to get good seats. The movie lasted for 2hrs, it was pretty alrite for me. I wasn't realli blown away, so I'll juz say tt it was average. I would recommand this movie to my frens though.  There were some already movies that I wanted to watch. First, The Notebook, but I think tt it's already over. Hopefully, I still get the change to watch it. Second is King Arthur, I'm definitely gonna catch it wif some of my frens. Finally, Brotherhood, a Korean movie tt I realli wanna watch too. I hope my frens would ask me out to watch it.  After the movie, I went to popular and picked up some stuffs b4 heading home for dinner. I took a shower after dinner b4 starting on my F coursework evaluation. I worked all the way frm 8pm to 9:30pm. Luckily I managed to complete it as the deadline is tmr. Haha, well I guess tt's 'bout it. Anyway I would like to ask if any1 is interested to go watch King Arthur and Brotherhood wif me? If u r, pls lemme noe alrite? The earlier the betta ya? If no money, at most I treat u la! Haha, alrite, I'll stop here for now. Cya~ =]
