I personally don't have anything against clowns. Well... mostly. The one in "IT" is still a bit scary, but that's just because I was traumatized. The way I see it is that if it's creepy, poke it. Then, based upon its reaction, do it again, and again, and again. Then it'll just cry a lot. There, now it's not creepy anymore. :P     {Geoffrey}
