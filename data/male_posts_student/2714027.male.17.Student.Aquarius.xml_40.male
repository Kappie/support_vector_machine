It's been quite a lot of work, but it's been worth it I think. Today a couple of websites, tomorrow the world! Or something like that anyway.  So I got to school and was then given a whole load of money in cash from my host which was pretty good. It's nice to go around with a wad of notes in your wallet and feel like you could buy almost anything. No chance of that though, as the money's going straight back into Thunderbolt. I'll be a millionaire one day maybe, but not today.  After a fairly average school day, I got home and had a whole load of emails in my inbox, mostly about Clan Recruiter. I was also pleased to see the huge amount of traffic that the site has received. Now I'm sitting here writing this and wondering which homework I should do, if any. I should really do one, but I'm hungry and I have a review to finish.. Then again, it's a crap game and my hunger can be kept down until later, so it looks like the absolute  joy  of homework will win over.  On a completely irrelevant point, I saw  Cruel Intentions  for the second time yesterday and it was surprisingly much better than the first time I saw it. Strange, how that happens. On the subject of TV and film, I caved into my urges and purchased a limited edition DVD box set of series 1 and 2 of  24 , which I love so much. It'll take over 36 hours to watch, but at least I'll never have nothing to do ever again.
