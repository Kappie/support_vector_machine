And then the carnage is showed in slow motion, and there's some slow sort of choral type of music, or else a single violin playing slow, slow scales; and everything's quiet except for echoes. And the echoes don't just echo anything, it's selective echoing; When the main character, who's really buff, stubs his toe, it echoes for five minutes, and they show the look of pain on his face, but when a generic private gets his head blow up by a friendly artillery shell, there's not a sound.   If I ever was in a battle, I'd wear a handlebar mustache and a bushy wig. I figure we'd all have a laugh, a couple cold beers (or the beverage in fashion for that particular time and place at whatever temperature it tastes best at).
