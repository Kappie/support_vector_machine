No subliminal messaging here!  There's one eensy-weensy (GIGANTIC) little thing that's been bugging me ever since I started using AIM.  Now, I don't use it nearly to the extent that some who stay on 24/7 (BUT I'M GETTING THERE) and can amazingly hold conversations with approximately 15 people at one time do, but I like to consider myself fairly versed in the ways of AIM.  Basically, when I use it, I follow the same rules that I follow in a phone conversation.  In fact, much of the terminology, structure, pace, and rhythm are the same that I use in a normal phone conversation (which these days are few and far between).  One of my pet peeves--a small one (I WILL CRY IF YOU BREAK IT), but one nonetheless--is when one party starts a conversation, both parties converse, and then one just suddenly ends the conversation by getting offline.  Now, before you start rolling your eyes and clucking your tongues, it's not just a "hey, I got booted off" kind of thing.  It's pretty much the same as if you get knocked off a phone line.  There are certain rules of phone/AIM etiquette, IMHO (if we're going to break it down to AIM terminology), that one should follow: greet, converse, and say goodbye.  If one of those is missing, somethin' ain't workin' right .  This has happened to me on several occasions with several--but not many by any means--people, and only recently has it started bugging me--so much, in fact, that it makes me not want to have a conversation online with said people at all (FOLLOW THE RULES OR FACE MY WRATH).  Come on, just one little three letter word would suffice: "bye."  Is that too much too ask?  Probably so, so I'll end my rant there.  I looked at  urlLink Pepperdine  today and loved it except that...well...PU and I wouldn't click too well on certain personal levels.  However, just looking at the pictures of the campus has only served to reaffirm my conviction that I will end up going to school in California.  Ha!--you say--but didn't you swear up and down that you wanted to be a New Yorker forever and ever amen?  Yes, but that was then and this is now, so there.  Nah nah nee booh booh! (YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!)  Eh...my head hurts.
