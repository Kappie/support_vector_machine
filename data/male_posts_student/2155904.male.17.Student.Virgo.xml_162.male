Today was certainly not a normal day.  However, no day is really normal anymore.  Everyday has some new twist to it.  And isn't that just great?  Well, it would be better if everyday was wonderful but that would also depreciate the value of wonderful.  Unless you took the statement literally and that since it was already stated that everyday is wonderful, there would either be no varying degrees of wonderful or there would be varying degrees of wonderful but every degree is still wonderful in itself.  By the way, that makes perfect sense.  At 11, Purdy, Bigmaca, Macaroon, VD, Dotti, Amed, and Dr. Phil all came over to "discuss" the Hamlet stuff and work on that junk.  Well that just ended up being the Hamlet movie playing while nobody really payed much attention to it and then Amed, Dr. Phil, and Macaroon left cuz they really didn't care about it and weren't paying any attention and were talking.  After that VD left and shortly thereafter Bigmaca left.  So Tyke, Purdy, and Dotti got up and stopped watching the movie to get food from upstairs.  They made a wide variety of lunches that included much of Tyke's pantry.  They ate and chatted and then went downstairs again.  They picked out a movie from Tyke's collection and popped that in.  The Hours got the selection by Purdy and it was a pretty good movie actually.  Kind of weird and different but that is what made it good.  It was a little bit confusing at times but it was cleared up.  Tyke didn't really think the ending was anything too spectacular though.  Just eh.  Dotti left in the middle of the movie and then Purdy left after the whole thing finished.  So it was just Tyke alone at his house again.  He did nothing until about 4 when he watched this thing on TV about William Hung (American Idol reject) and saw his new music video.  He feels kinda sorry for the guy and also that his video is gay because of gay producers or whoever made it.  Then after that he went down to FedEx to get his brother's college packet from American University in D.C. where he is going for law school this fall.  He stopped by Fred Meyer and checked out some music/DVDs because he just didn't want to go home and he was looking hot and he felt numb emotionally for some reason.  It was kind of weird actually.  So he came home and waited around until Kinker got online and then they planned a very good poker game.  It was a great group of guys.  Tyke, Kinker, MSwa, Tyronious, Macaroon, Fejj, and DCups.  Tyke got 3rd and ended up only losing $5.  MSwa got second and took $20 from the pot and Kinker won with $50 from the pot.  The $5 buy-in game was very nice.  With lots of people it makes it more fun.  Then Tyke came home to find an IM on his computer from Purdy.  Even though it didn't say anything it's nice to see that somebody IM'd him.  It really doesn't matter who it is.  Just seeing that little message box fade from the black screen that the computer takes on while sleeping is very nice.  So that was cool.  Then he put on his reversible shorts and blogged.  And he feels somewhat at peace with his life.  Although really he wants to send that peace into turmoil that shortly would become heavenly serenity.  If you know what he means.
