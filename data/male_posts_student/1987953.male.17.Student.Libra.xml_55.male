Right now I am taking advantage of the time in Journalism that I can't find anything to do with and blog instead. I am the Sports Writer for the Edgewood High School Newspaper in Journalism class this semester, and right now we are between seasons, so I have nothing to do as of yet. I will have at least one article in the newspaper. When my first article ever is published, I'll blog it.   Thanks for the really awesome music discussions on my comments. I am glad everyone is able to have a civil conversation on my page. Apparantly some people were not aware that I set down rules before. Sometime I need to find a way to put this on my comment page through my template: 1. Be respectful especially when you disagree. 2. Comment!!!  Well, how was Valentine's Day for everyone? Brittany and I had a really good Valentine's Day. She and her aunt picked me up around 9:00 and I went to her house where we hung out for a little bit. We then went to see  urlLink  50 First Dates   at AMC Movie Theater, and then went to  urlLink Olive Garden  for dinner. After that we went back to her house to hang out a while. I gave her a dozen red roses, a chocolate rose (because she hates the assorted kind that comes in the heart boxes that I wanted to get her), a larger sized red teddy bear with a heart pillow that says "Happy Valentine's Day" and a really big card. She got me a big box of assorted chocolate,  a small teddy bear with a frame, two votive (spelling?) candles for my cross candle holder from  urlLink Britney  for Christmas. She also got me sleep pants from Old Navy with "love dice" on them. It was a great night.   Well, about  urlLink  50 First Dates  , it was pretty good. Drew Barrymore was great in it. Adam Sandler was just good old Adam Sandler and did absolutely fantastic. Sean Astin, who also played the hobbit Sam on  urlLink  LoTR movies   did very well as the steroid-enhanced older brother Doug. Drew's character's father was played by one of my favorite actors, Blake Clark. Clark played Chet Hunter (Shawn's father) on   urlLink Boy Meets World  . Rob Schneider, from   urlLink The Hot Chick   was Adam's character's dumb Hawaiian buddy.  Now for the editorial: The casting director gets a "two-thumbs-up" rating, and five stars, but the writer of the movie gets kudos for the dumbest movie in the history of the world. I won't ruin the ending for those who want to watch it, but Adam's character is on a boat ride and gets stranded on a different part of Hawaii than where he lives. He meets Drew's character in a run-down quaint diner building her waffles into houses. They hit it off and she invites him to breakfast at the same place the next morning. He accepts. The next morning he gets there to find that she does not know who he is. The waitress tells him she has short-term memory loss from a blow to the head she suffered in a car accident. He meets the father and brother who live their lives continuing to make her believe she is reliving the same day because she still thinks it's October 17th of 2003 and not April of 2004. Her father and brother, teamed up with Adam's character, come up with a way to refresh her memory every morning and hope with everything that they have that it works. The end is surprising. I like the fact that it is a happy ending, but it's not that great a movie. Going to the movies is fun, but don't waste your time or money. Go see   urlLink Lord of the Rings: Return of the King   or something instead. Rent this one. It's good, but not that good.   Has anyone seen   urlLink Barbershop 2  ? Is it as good as the first? Anything with  urlLink Cedric the Entertainer  is hilarious. (For instance,  urlLink The Steve Harvey Show .) What was also great was mixing  urlLink Martin Lawrence  with Cedric in  urlLink  Big Momma's House  . Anything with Martin Lawrence is the funniest!  Also, I have one music review:  urlLink Randy Travis , country music singer, has a great worship album,   urlLink Randy Travis: Worship  Faith  . It mixes country and worship in a way even better than   urlLink Rise and Shine  . Although   urlLink Three Wooden Crosses   is one of the best songs I have heard in a while. I am just overall a Country music fan, especially if it is about God or patriotism. I love all kinds of music unless it is Laura or SWolf's kind, nothing against them.  Anyway, I gotta go, so blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >
