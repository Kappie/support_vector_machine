We played alot and had fun, we made up a song and tried to play Toxicity and Everlong. We were all alone with know adults and we heard footsteps from upstairs, I had a work out bar, Matt had a 2x4 wooden plank and Mike had a huge broom. We searched the house... no bad guy. After they left, I got excited for the storm... IT NEVER FUCKIN CAME!!! What, two lightening bolts? Big deal, I wanted alot of storm... A BIG STORM! Well, I have no clue what I'm doing tonight... maybe going to the bball game at SMS, or just sitting home like a little good boy I am. No... now I edited it. I definetly didn't go to the gay basketball game that Bono wanted me to go to just to watch him beat Paul's team. Pat came over, then we went to Pat's house and attacked all these 6th graders. It was Pat's little sister's bday and she had all the "MONKEYS" over so we played football with them. This one time I had the ball... I think 20 little girls molested me.  Pat jumped on me almost stopping my lungs from working.The girls were fuckin slapping me and kicking me, this one girl grabbed... well forget that. Another time the same thing happened to Pat, and I was in the brawl laughing in his face. It was mucho fun. Pat came back to my house again and the next thing I knew I was dead on the couch 2 in the morning with Apollo 13 on. TRACK INVITATIONAL TOMORROW IT SUCKS!!!!!
