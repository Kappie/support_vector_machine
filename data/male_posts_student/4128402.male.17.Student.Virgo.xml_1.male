And no my lack of blogging was not the result of an unfortunate smelting incident, kidnap by a flange of baboons or because i had gone to ground after the events of this past saturday, but merely my computer is jobbies and refused to comply with my commands this past week. But now all is well and my stream of consciousness can resume. So, what have i been up to during my exodus i hear you ask with baited breath? Fuck all comes the loud reply. I went to glasgow yesterday to look at guitars well out of my price range and i spent my evenings watching the Godfather trilogy, which was rather good i must say, although part 3 is largely testes. Tomorrow im being taken against my will and better judgement to some family shindig which i can tell you right now will be pish. My family are not the best people to gather together in the one room. There will be serious bitching behind backs, false smiles and eyes of daggers. Its total hypocracy and im going to be sitting there witnessing it all, and of course the next day it wont be mentioned, all the back stabbing will be swept under the carpet and people will pretend as usual that its all rosy. What pish. I would be so much happier if everyone in the world who doesnt like someone else, rather than put on some facade or worse, be honest to each other and have a full blown fight thereby embarrassing themselves and me, just to ignore each other. Dont even make eye contact. Of such things my dreams are made. But the reality is that my brothers girlfriend (who is a tad older than him) will be the focus of most of said backstabbing seeing as my mother does not approve of the age difference, or, god forbid, my auntie shows up like she did the other night. It will be war i promise you. In an attempt to make tomorrow night more bearable i started asking around for some friends to go but i gave up when the first 2 i asked had prior engagments, poking bum or otherwise (tashleighs party) and just as i had resigned myself to defeat young nickolai stepped up to the plate and said he would accompany me. Joy, rapture. At least now although i shant be a total nigel, my turning up with a friend rather than a date will attract awkward looks from family members as they jump to conclusions as regards my (in their opinion) already ambiguous sexuality. A fun filled evening indeed. It might not be as bad as i fear, but i'll ready the battalion for the worst nonetheless. By the way im quitting my job. As soon as i find something else im upping sticks. The managers are fannies, they dont care about their staff and dont heed their questions or complaints, so fuck them. Young Downey has also joined the unemployed masses after he told them where to go when they refused him a night off for some shitey reason, they blamed him for a mistake being made that wasnt his fault so he left, and a round of applause was garnered. My main reason for leaving is that even though i've asked twice now for any overtime available to be sent my way they've bypassed my pleas and gave the work to Robert as always, that boy might as well live there he spends so much time in the place, im sure he really lives in a tent in the carpark and just returns home for a shower now and again, its unbelievable. So if they dont care for my work ethic enough to send some extra hours my way they can jump up my arse and die. The job hunt begins in earnest this monday. Well im offski, i'll regail my tale of woe from tomorrow night soon no doubt.
