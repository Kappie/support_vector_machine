Living e hell out of mi, i e only thing tat could describe my feelings now. Guys, if i seems 2 be unhaapy these few days, dun blame mi, cause just too upset. E always happy n laughing Chun Kiat will be gone for a little while, cause lots of things r bothering mi. Everyday still have 2 get my ass back 2 sch, totally asburd, luckily still gt e third week not occupied yet, oso dun know if still got chance 2 celebrate my monthly anniversary wif Jane a not, just too confused. Guys dun be fooled by my happiness or laughter n smile cause deep down inside mi, u wouldn't knoe how exactly i feel, reallie....... think i better let nature take its course ba. Gd friends or ppl out there tat is concerned about mi, dun worry, i will be fine soon.... Everybody take care n treasure ur love ones.
