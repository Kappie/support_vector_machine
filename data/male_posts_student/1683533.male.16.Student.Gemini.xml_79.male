It was one of those movies that has all those twists...god I love those...  Uhm...what else have I been doing.  I am of course never doing homework...not off to the best start...I find myself putting my homework aside until like...11 o clock at night.  Then, I will fall asleep before i ever get started.  So then, I am doing homework during other classes.  But, I usually don't get all of it done.  So, I really need to get off my lazy ass and start workin...  I bought two books:  Downsize This!  by  Micheal Moore  ( I felt the need to pick up one of his books after I saw  Bowling For Columbine ) and  The Bush Dyslection   by...uhm...I forgot who...and it is in my bag which is in my sis's car, and I don't feel like getting it, quite frankly...I am reading   Downsize This!   right now...It is very good so far.  What am I listening to alot?    The Queers, The Real Mckenzies, Squirtgun, Ben Folds, and The Suicide Machines  ...The Suicide Machines have been one of my main cds I play when I go out for my daily walks for several months now....I really got hooked to them.  Yes, I take walks...I get bored...so I just grab a water and my cd player and walk to the gas station or...wherever i feel like.  For my English Class we have to write a person narrative.  I am having alot of fun with that (No sarcasm...and no sarcasm in the "no sarcasm" and no sarcasm in the "no sarcasm in the 'no sarcasm'" and no sarcasm in the- *is shot*).  I really am having fun tho.  From people that have read it so far they think it is funny.  I will post it on here as soon as it is finished, k? OK.  Blah blah blah...still looking for love...blah blah blah school is stupid...blah blah blah sameoldsameold....  "It's all about money!" -The Suicide Machines
