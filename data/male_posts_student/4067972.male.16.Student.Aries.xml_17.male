To us this ment get all of the furniture out of the room that night so we don't have to do it early in the morning.  To robert watson, this was just tentative until he decided on what time he wanted our carpet to be installed.  My mom called him at 9:30am to ask why the carpet ppl weren't here yet.  Robert watson said that he never told us that the installers would be at our house by 8.  He said he had us scheduled for the afternoon install (11-12).  My mom questioned this and then he started on his whole schpeal about my mom not listening to him and her being a liar.  With all the trouble that we have had with him in the past ( which is a lot, by the way), plus this phone call, my mom went nuts on him.  She gave him a piece of her mind with him telling her that he is the one that knows everything, she's just a customer...and so on.  Well, my mom called my aunt who works at lowes in warsaw, and she called the muncie lowes and got everything straightened out.  The installers came around 11 and were finished in about 4hrs.  After we got everything back in place, i told my mom i had to get a bottle of pop for a thing at jessie's house and went to wal-mart.  I didn't get the pop, but i got my mom flowers.  I made her cry again (i didn't do it the first time, just the second time for her today), but i think it was ok this time.
