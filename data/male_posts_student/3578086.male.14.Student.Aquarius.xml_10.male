I was planing to do my exams in febuary and my mum out of kindness had got a tutor for me. One day i was leaving my tutor and i heard my mum and her talking. My tutor was like "I dont think he is going to get into the school" and my mum said "No none of us do". That hit me hard. So i took the exams and failed like they said i would and then my gran died and then i had sats and i didnt do as well as i should have done and i had a nervous break down kind off thing. Well Year 7 was ok and then year 8 (my current year). The Final year t my school which i have been at for 10 years. My mum put me into over revise and the stress levels started. They still didnt think i would get into the school i wanted and even if i did it wont be as good as my oh so perfect brother who got 2 scholarships to the same schools. I revised while being low and sad. I did the exams and i got into both schools. You may think this would make me happy but it just hit how badly i was going to miss my current school.  For my whole life i have known i am gay. Well in the easter break i just came out to my self. Which was so hard and thats when i started badly. i told a few friends and then the "cool guy" at my school found out. Now when he does not like something i can feel it. He ignored me for about 2 weeks and i felt like utter shit (mind my swearing sorry). I told my other friends that i was gay too. They were ok but since then they r distant from me. Well this cool guy told all his mates and then the other cool people found out and well... they have such a big infulence on everyvody else that i just couldnt cope. Then for a while i had like loved the original "cool guy" (if u still follow) and well i told some one that i shouldnt have told and they told him and for the past 2 weeks now i have been so sad i cant lift my head. I lock my self in my room and just cry. Well i have to prentend to be over him just so he doesnt make me feel like shit. And i told my closest most important friend and she was like oh that must be hard but u have to tell ur brother. And i just felt bad. She did not care about me but my brother and now the whole skool knows about me and i didnt want them to and the staff know tho they havnt said nothing there are comments that have been made and everybody is just different to me and my family is falling apart and my brother is in trouble and i am cutting my self.  That is my story. It is pethetic i know but i am not a strong person at all.I cant cope with anything.
