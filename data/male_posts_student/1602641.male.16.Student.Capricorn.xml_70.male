Written by Tina Fey, with plenty of cameos by former and present SNL stars like Tim Meadows, Tina, Amy Pohler, and that other weird woman, I felt pretty at home during the film. My favorite part though, is when a guy presents Cady (Lohan) with a business card that titles him as "Math Enthusiast/Kick Ass MC". I have to make business cards.
