And in 6th, I have Trystin his Dictionary. He thanked me for it, although I would like a different kinda of thanks, but that is another story. Oh, funny story:  I have my TI-83 in my back pocket, because I didn't want to carry it, and I was too lazy to go to my locker, so I went into French before the testing started, and Leland was in there, and he walked up behind me, and he reached out for my calculator, and Mr. Hill said "Donâ€™t grabbed his butt!" and Leland responded with "But I.....I....." and he turned bright red. LOL. And I said "Yea! Don't grab my butt!" Secretly saying in my mind "Please grab my butt!"  Okay, sorry. I love to get side tracked. Now onto today's events. I took my math final, and that was it. I slept most of 6th. It felt good to sleep. And I woke up and Leland was staring at me. Trystin was also playing footsie with me too! Oh yea! I never thought I would get over Quinn, and in a way I never will, but I think I'm coming out of my shell and beginning to move on. I'm flirting again, which is good. I'm so bored. No one is online, and everyone has plans for tonight, except me. Stefani is hanging out with Jerry. Dez is going to California. Nat is going to a party. Jacquie is going to hang out with friends, and then to California. Will is going over to Mike's tomorrow. Ryan is going over to his boyfriend's house tomorrow. So I guess I will just spend it with my mom. I might convince her to go to the AT store, so I can get a new cell phone. My current phone:     can't hold a charge to save its life. So I might get one of these:      Like it? I do. But I don't know if she will go for it, or if the store will have it.  Well, I'm outta things to say, so I'm gonna go. I will post more tonight.   NO SCHOOL TOMORROW! OH YEA!
