We walked around and talked for a bit; but I had fun. I acted like I was cutting myself and shit, so yeah... LOL.  I'm so fucking tired. My stepdad is sleeping, and my mom's watching T.V. {God is in the T.V.}, so I can't listen to music... dammit. I just need to hear something soothing and relaxing, to get me ready for bed. Must... sleep.... gah...  I need to work out. I really, really need to work out... but I'm just too tired. It can wait until my brain has had a proper cooldown, LOL.  I want to go and sleep forever, but I want to wait up and talk to Jamie... I didn't think I could fall for another girl...
