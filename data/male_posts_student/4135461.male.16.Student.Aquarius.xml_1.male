This is the natural next step for our show.  We get our freedom back to do  a funny, clever, entertaining and at times (wink wink) edgy show that our fans have enjoyed for the past 10 years!  We're still figuring out all the details but we'd like to broadcast our first show in over 2 years live from a venue to be named later on October 1st!  It's going to be a huge celebration.  Until then we plan on traveling the country visiting our fans to personally thank them for their support and turning them on to the excitement of XM Satellite Radio!Please join us today at noon at the Hard Rock Cafe on 57th street between 7th avenue and Broadway as we field questions from the media.........UGH!  Beer will flow! Finally, I want to take this time to thank our fans for their continued support over the past 2 years.  Because of you the Opie and Anthony show never officially went away.  The amount of O material that continues to be traded on the internet around the world is astounding!  Thanks to:  urlLink www.foundrymusic.com    urlLink www.wackbag.com   urlLink www.saveopieandanthony.net   urlLink www.oavirus.com   urlLink www.opieandanthony.net  Just to name a few!
