Being back in Texas is almost like I never left-- like life kept moving and I was ushered back in without missing a step.  Everything seems the same, only I feel different.  I can't really put my finger on it, but I just look at things differently.  For example, I was at the grocery store the other day and I was amazed that everything-- I mean everything-- you find is low-fat, fat-free, low-carb, atkins friendly-- it is ridiculous.  America is pretty big on fad-dieting and the latest is the Atkins low carbohydrate diet.  Subway sandwiches even made a new wrap that is "atkins friendly."  Am I the only one who thinks this is crazy?!  I know this is a silly example, but I guess i just have a new perspective on a lot of different things.    I have a bunch of International students in my International trade class, and it reminded me of the classes back in Barcelona; I was half expecting Magnus to comment on something, or Tim and Adam to start making fun of me (aka "taking the piss").  Actually, there are 2 ESADE students in that class on exchange-- so there's a little Spanish flavor (not flavour) in the place!    What have I been doing since I've been back?  A ton of COUNTRY DANCING!!  Imagine Adam dancing at one of the Barcelona clubs and multipy that by 10-- that's me when I go dance at Midnight Rodeo.  No...  not an actual rodeo with bull-riding and cattle-roping, just a club/bar that I go to every thursday.  Let's see, I turned the big 21 a few weeks ago so I can finally drink legally in the United States.  I kicked off the event by going downtown the night before my birthday at midnight to get all sorts of free stuff-- free shot at every bar, free t-shirts, etc.  Well, after a night full of dancing on bars, body shots, hugging lots of random people, and singing/yelling down the streets, my friends carried me back to my room.  The next day I was back-- getting a free, very potent, Mexican martini at a place called Trudy's (kind of a right of passage for University of TX students).  So, all in all, it was a great birthday.    Now, however, it's back to the grindstone.  I have three exams next week and some internship interviews... YIKES.  Amidst the hecticness of my life, I find myself thinking about the carefree days of Barcelona and all of the friends I met there.  Luckily Seema is here so I know everything wasn't a dream or some crazy acid trip.  It's nice to be able to share memories of our friends in Barcelona.  I miss you all, and I hope to hear from you soon.  P.S.  Share some of the snow!!! We're having pretty mild weather, sunny, and blue skies-- it's supposed to be winter... not spring
