After breakfast, we spent much of the morning watching his automan and cartoon vcd's.  Today, yuqi had a final dentist appointment. So, early in the afternoon we headed off to the dental hospital. The hospital itself was much bigger than any dentists i've seen in the uk. A large very square building over several floors. The treatment seemed to take place in 2 large rooms on the second floor. Unlike the uk, there were several dentists separated by partitions like in an office.  After the first phase of treatment was complete, we headed off to a shopping mall to get some new sunglasses for yuqi. We eventually settled on a very unusual and cool pair. Then, we popped into the supermarket to get some food for our journey (and some more for a few lucky people back home!).  Finally, it was back to the dentist for yuqi, before heading back for dinner. After all their hospitality and kindness, today was our turn to buy a meal before we went. We'd asked them to find a special restaurant just for our last meal. It was me, yuqi, her parents and her sister together with her husband and son. The restaurant was very local, and we had our own room on the 3rd floor with a single large circular table. We ate some very fresh fish, pigs ears (suprisingly nice), tofu, spicy lamb, pork with clear noodles, pork and radish balls, sweet fried cakes and soup. It was huge and delicious, a great last meal!  While we were eating, there was a thunderstorm. Luckily, it had come and gone by the time we'd finished. So we walked home in the cool evening air. It was quite late when we got back, so we fell asleep very quickly. Our last night to sleep in shijiazhuang in yuqi's parents apartment.
