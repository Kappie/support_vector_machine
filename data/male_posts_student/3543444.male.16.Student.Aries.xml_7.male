He was very hardworking, easy to get along with, had the build to intimidate anyone, and taught me many things I learned today, He graduated two years ago, and then enlisted into the Marines and was shipped off in November of 2002. I haven't talked to him since but when he calls he always seems to ask about me. I really look up to him and also plan to enlist in the Marines. The last I heard, he was in Japan and tried to call during the day over there, but was like 4:00 in the morning over here! Well thats pretty much it, the bond between me and my cousin.
