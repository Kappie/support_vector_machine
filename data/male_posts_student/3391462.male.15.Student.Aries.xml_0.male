My brother is the biggest person in my life over anyone else that could possible impact me, my brother is well my hero, to say the least he is my inspiration to do the things that I do, participate in the ways that I act and try to act. Sure life is touch but I still know that my brother is there for me and will love me no matter the situation. I mean he is 20 about to be 21 and has been through the same hard path that I am taking so little hints and tips are always accepted. He knows how to be a teenager and then moving up to becoming an adult, more responsibility. My brother can handle almost anything thrown at him, and I look up to him for support about all the issues that I face, being that as it may he is the one person that I know can help me. Better then 100 social workers he is the man with the plan! And will soon teach me how to drive like a man! ADAM I LOVE BEING YOUR BROTHER!  Â
