Aside from starring in Orange Days, a new series presented for download by Japan-TV, she is also the first in my week-long tribute to attractive Japanese women.  I know, it's a rough gig, but someone has to do it.  As far as I can tell, Manami is new to the dorama scene.  Orange Days is the first thing I've seen her in, though  urlLink JDorama  lists her in nine shows.  Gives a whole new reason to expand one's horizons.  She has a very slender face, and her slight features conspire to present almost an elfin beauty.  Manami's eyes are her most persuasive attriubutes, luminous pools of polished onyx which offer, even if only through the magic of photography, an allure that is both mysterious and deceptively accessable.
