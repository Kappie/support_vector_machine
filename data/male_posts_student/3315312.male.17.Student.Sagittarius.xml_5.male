What is certain is that both Nathan and I will continue to dedicate ourselves to politics, discourse, and democracy. (Pardon me for the corny speech, it's late at night.)  I have decided to start a new blog. It is called:  urlLink Invade This!  and will contain personal essays, analysis, articles, and general talking points. (Comments from potential sympathizers and critics as well!) It will of course pertain to politics and current events, but as I said before, few things are certain. Will it stay in the realm of politics and current events? Most likely. Will it remain active for a substantial period of time? Doubtful. Is it even worth perusing? As long as there is a thing called boredom, the answer is absolutely.
