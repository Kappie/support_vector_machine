I don't why i thought of this, but i guess when you're lying in bed at 2 in the morning half asleep after watching a movie that had a horrible plot and even worse acting (Rat Race, actually i shouldn't say all that, personally i loved Rat Race) but still managed to make you laugh, you think of strange things.   Namely the first incident that comes to mind is one where i was younger, i was having a grand old time lighting matches in our back yard, seeing how close i could get the flame to my finger until i had to let go. Well the first time trying that I realised that fire is EXTREMELY hot, I promptly burnt my finger and threw the match to the ground, coincidentally it landed in a large clump of dead dry grass. It lit on fire and I was running around like an idiot tryng to put it out. While stumbling around like a buffoon in my search for any liquid to put out the flame, I came across a large bottle of cooking oil. Needless to say, cooking oil does not, in any way, shape or form, put out fire. The fire became bigger and eventually I put it out with our good friend water and covered the burnt patch with more dead grass(a little ironic??).    Another Incident that comes to mind is one that thankfully does not involve me. Some of my friends were out camping and they got it into their heads that throwing lit matches at each other would be fun, usually it is but not when there's dry grass under your feet. Soon enough there was a rather large grass fire on hand. This fire spread to underneath an old dilapitated truck that had attracted a colony of bees. Not being there I had to laugh, I imagined all of them running around trying to put out the fire while avoiding the very angry and upset bees.    I'm not even going to mention the game called Fire Ball, except that it involves a sock, a pop can, and some lighter fluid, other then that, due to certain....uh....legal reasons, I will say no more.    These are some of my more memorable fire experiences, and the moral of this blog is...don't play with fire...what the hell kind of moral is that???  Not playing with fire should be the most obvious thing ever, really, you should listen to your parents more.  What kind of stupid, low-life, idiotic human being would do such an irresponsable thing?........Oh wait....heh, nevermind. -Matt
