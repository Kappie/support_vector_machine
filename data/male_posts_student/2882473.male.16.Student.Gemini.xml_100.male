I haven't spoken to  urlLink Dickybod  recently though, not since Tuesday evening, so I've no idea where he's up to. His lack of appearences on MSN though can only mean he has been reading a lot though.  So, apart from reading, I haven't really done much at all today at all. I've spent a while on the computer too, so it's been another boring day for me.  Well, it's leavers day tomorrow, which means I have to go to school, carrying all my heavy textbooks which I've borrowed for the past 2 years, and hand them back. What fun that will be. :)  I'll probably have a game of chess later, I need to improve quite a bit, I'm not too good at it at the moment. Oh yes, and I also intend to learn to write with my left hand, which I think may come in useful one day. Or not, but it's a worthwhile skill to have.  That will be all for now, a nice short post again.  Bye bye.   Weather:  Thunder, light rain  Reading:  Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix  Listening to:  'I've Got A Lovely Bunch Of Coconuts' - Monty Python  Watching:  Nowt  Confused about:  Nowt  Annoyed with:  Sunburn, still sore  Mood:  Ok
