Well, the two required ones (the elective starts next Wednesday, but mine only meets on Mondays and Tuesdays, so I guess it doesn't start for almost 2 more weeks.  I don't understand the scheduling quirks here.), Property and Torts.  They seem fine.  I can't figure out how to turn the alarm off my watch (I got it for free, so how much can I complain...) -- I had set it initially during exams as a backup, for 7:30 AM, but then it woke me up one morning after exams, so I changed it to 12:00 figuring I wouldn't care if it went off every day at noon.  And I forgot about it.  Until noon today, when I was sitting in class.  It starts beeping.  I immediately fumble around and press every button as fast as I can, simultaneously shutting off the beeping, starting the stopwatch, and resetting the seconds counter.  Five minutes later it starts beeping again.  I think I jumped.  Pressed the buttons again.  Realized that it's going to keep going off every 5 minutes until I let it beep for the full minute.  I don't know why this is.  So for the rest of class -- 4 more 5-minute cycles -- I was vigilant -- VIGILANT, I tell you -- about staring at my watch and watching the second count down until that 5-minute mark, and trying to intercept the beeping by pushing the buttons immediately.  It went okay I guess, except that I was freaking out in my head.  It's not a particularly loud alarm, and I'm in the back row (results of the random assigned seating lottery -- back row in both of my classes), so I'm guessing the professor didn't hear it anyway.  And if he did, he doesn't know who we are yet anyway.  But I really need to figure out how to shut this thing off, which combination of the 4 buttons needs to be pressed so this watch makes no noise ever again.  Or I need to hit it with a hammer.
