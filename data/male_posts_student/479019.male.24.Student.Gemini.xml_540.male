I did a little bit of paper work, but not as much as I should.   I was thinking... one of my biggest flaws is that I hang on to things and dwell on things longer than I should. I have a personality in which I have pick it apart from every angle. See all the possibilities and re-live the events thinking "what if?" It's completely opposite from what that girl told me she thought of me a few weeks ago. She said I seem like the type who doesn't give a fuck. I guess you could say I'm always bouncing from the different side of my personality. I'm pretty schizophrenic. I mean... with the way I've been running myself into the ground this summer... and not to mention doing and saying stupid shit... yea it seems like I don't give a fuck. Yet I'm very aware of the consequences of what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing is detrimental to my health, wallet, grades, social relationships, etc. I also think about those consequences a lot... way more than I should actually.   I forsee another pizza in my near future. Oh and for you vegetarian friends that read this. I always make veggie pizzas. Aren't ya proud of me?  ***
