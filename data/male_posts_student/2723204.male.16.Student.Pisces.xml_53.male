Nothing with Kerry here. Its just the 10 lies Bush told you, and I saw a book called Bush "a man of faith" outside the church bookshop. Its gone the last time I saw, didn't know if they recalled the stock or it got sold out.  Dumb if religion takes part in politics, look, Jesus did not go meddle around with the military, he was a nice guy preaching about faith hope and love, and helping people live better lives and gain insight on their lives. No, Jesus did not have control of a thousand odd nukes with Abram tanks, talking about waging a "crusade". Jesus, was a very very nice guy, y'noe, i somewhat think Mahatma Gandhi fits the description more than Martin Luther who went and persecuted the Jews.   Nice, if the church was any more open, we would refer to Martin Luther as the founder of the protestant reformation who persecuted the Jews. He's got jew blood on his hands, maybe I'm gonna take a theological look on this, yea, he was a great man, moved in the "holy spirit", BUT HE'S GOT JEW BLOOD ! Ohhh, pop quiz, can he go to heaven? sorry, you can't use 50/50 on that. Now come on, its time to snap out of this utopianist mentality and realize how many mistakes the church had made, think that its "heaven on earth", snap out of it.  We're in this world but not of this world, huh, some think we're enclosed in some protective bubble. But wrong, we're all subject to social construction, to human faults. I mean, Jesus would have been real disspointed, he looks at Gandhi, and says, whoo, someone who is somewhat like me......the suddenly he realize that he's got a altar of Vishnu in his home.   Jesus, to me, was a feminist who believed in equality, read my 2nd post. No where in the 4 gospels did it say the "wives submit to your husbands". Take away the romantic connotations its simply, "women submit to the men". Some scholars believed that Paul did not write that because of writing style. Besides the first feminists were christian. Its sick to see how the followers of Jesus take his name and start messing it up for the world to see.  I love Jesus, hell yea, that's not even cheesy. It used to be a radical, christian, bigoted phrase, the kinda blind leading the blind kinda thing, you know what I mean. But if you look at it through what I just said, it entails an entirely different meaning. It means using plain common sense, to achieve general world peace, harmony between all of God's creation, and to strive for a better sense of well-being of God's creation. That's what I meant when i said "I love Jesus". Not a relentless, power hungry drive to establish christianity as the main and only religion.   I love Jesus has taken on a whole new meaning........
