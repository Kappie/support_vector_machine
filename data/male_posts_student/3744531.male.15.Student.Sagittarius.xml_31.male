Well now I decided to create an account because of 2 things:  1.-IÂ´m tired to go with alex's house (my pal) to write thigs of my own, having a personal computer, what a stupid thing dont you think?  And 2.- Because I'm fighting for an account in Gmail...please ig someone of gmail is reading this i'm desseperated for an account...  Please send me and invitation...
