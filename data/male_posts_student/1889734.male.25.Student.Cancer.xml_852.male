Every American kid dreams of the World Series, but do they think about holding the (insert name of trophy nobody even knows here) over their head and kissing it??    I watched the entire game on Saturday, that game points out what I love/hate about playoff hockey... I wasted three hours of my life to watch Calgary lose, what a deflating moment, I hated it and I loved it.  By the by, he kicked it in anyway, his skate clearly jumped off of line a bit right when he was staring down at the puck...  I wish I were in a bar in Calgary right now...
