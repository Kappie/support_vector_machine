Jarome got 1 goal, 1 assist, and got in 1 fight. Which isn't too bad for a days work.  And on two of the goals the scorers did that funny thing where they basically jump full-on into the boards in celebration. And almost knock themselves out in the process.  Nothing else interesting happened today, apart from me managing to make my shoulder hurt more. Erm, yay?
