And special thanks to that random guy who posted in my last thing...im sorry your life sucks, but you have slightly improved mine by posting a comment when i dont know you!  in other news me and my brothers got the Radio machine ace found in a dumpster to work. turns out it gets color tv signals. we powered it by rigging up an old phones AC adapter to fit in the hole. i was proud of me. some of you saw that machine, and its impressive that it gets fox and nbc in full color relatively clearly...and free, did i mention totaly free?  but yeah. my stomach hurts ow. i think ill go to bed.  oh and on another note, if anyone in the world would pay me to make them a professional website i can do that cause im good at it AND i really need money. so yeah. cool.
