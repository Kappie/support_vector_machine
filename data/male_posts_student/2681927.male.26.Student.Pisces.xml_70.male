The book's main character is Maria Eriksson, a woman who got raped and battered by her former husband and then, after the divorce, haunted by the same man.  The book is based on a true story, Maria exists in real life. According to  urlLink an article  (Swedish only) in one of the largest Swedish newspaper,  urlLink Aftonbladet , written by Liza Marklund, Maria received asylum in the United States last year. Obviously, the Swedish government can't take care of it's own citizens. But I'm not surprised actually, the Social Democrats have made cuts in the funding for the police and the judicial system throughout the years to be able to sustain the flawed welfare programs so what else can one expect.
