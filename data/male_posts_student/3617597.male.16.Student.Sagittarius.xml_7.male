Im well and i aint come up with any more sarcastic comments or and moans to the world......but im sure there will be some to come.I would like to say thanks to Dani for entering my last comment and to moaning at the moan i made last time, Keep it up Dani. Thanks toClare as well, ive made a good home forher4 candels+stand, orange spray paint and Ikea light thingy which one of my weired freinds was jelous of.  Im going to Germany on sunday morning which is 2 days away. Im going with the York Youth Forum with 5 other people and we go for all the TV and Radio equipment so we can be on German TV and Radio. We get to use all the equipment whenever we want and we get to use professional recording studios and such like. The great thing is that its all payed for by the European Commission, God Bless Them, lol. We go for 2 weeks so i might send a blog from there just for the novelty of it all, im sad i know.  So ill write one then, but for now thats all
