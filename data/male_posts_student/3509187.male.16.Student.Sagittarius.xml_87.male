This happens to me every once and a while and I like referring to it as Punchy...  Its is the state I reach after night after night of limited sleep and a goodly amount of stress or anxiousness doesn't hurt... But don't get me wrong and think Punchy is another of my made up words, other people use the term... well my mom uses it, if she counts...  Do you know the feeling I'm talkinga bout?  Well I can't stand to keep typing its too slow...   -Dan V  PS I think I would make a very Violent Drunk so don't try and get me intoxicated...   -Dan V
