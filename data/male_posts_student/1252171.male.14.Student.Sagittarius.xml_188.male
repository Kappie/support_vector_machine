First, when I was waking my parents they fliped out on me for no apperent reason, then in first period (spanish) I forgot some importaint papers and she fliped out on me. Math is next, I couldn't unerstand these 10 problems. They were factoring polynomials. Science, I didn't have enough information. In Tech.ED. my friend was being a hipacrite. Then lunch. Not anything new. ELT, couldn't concentrate. Language, we had a b**ch of a teacher. Almost done, last class, social, I hate that teacher. When I was walking home I ran into an old enemy, I almost killed him, but I didn't. Now I'm here talking to you people. See you later. -Darkblaze-
