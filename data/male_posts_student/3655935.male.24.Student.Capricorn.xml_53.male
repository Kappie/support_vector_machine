This might oversimplify things, but the basic idea behind irresistible grace is that when God reveals his grace to anyone it is so compelling that no one can reject it.  I find this hard to believe for a number of reasons, but in this post, I think I'll just focus on one, the Bible.   I was reading Hebrews 12:14-17 this week, which included the command "See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God."  If God's grace is irresistible, then there is nothing we can do to ensure no one falls short of it.  The obvious implication is that God's grace can be resisted to some degree.  In 2 Corinthians 6:1 it says, "we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain."  Once again, the obvious implication is that some who receive God's grace could renounce it in vain.  To make a long story short, I don't see good reason to deny these verses their plain meaning.  I would rather deny Calvin's doctrine of irresistible grace and hold on to the Bible, than keep irresistible grace and compromise the Bible.  More needs to be said, but I think you get the point.
