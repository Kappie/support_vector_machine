I don't get pissed off with the person.Instead,i get pissed off with myself. It makes me become a victim of self-pity. Ah, self-pity,the most useless emotion in the world, yet at times i indulge in self-pity, thinking it'll make things better and ppl will take notice. Well, i'm a stupid fool everyday of the week, always bringing out this emotion, even now as i type this msg. Even worse is, i don't even know how to define my problem. It makes me feel even more that this is just an all act of self-pity. I can't stand the emotion, but i can't escape it, just can't escape it.....
