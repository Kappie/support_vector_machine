"Outside the dawn is waking, my makeup may be flaking but my smile still stays on," as Freddie Mercury croons.  I'm stressed by a dozen little things at once, but I feel almost obligated to continue laughing and cracking jokes and being the clown of the world, sans stupid wig and custard pie.  But why?  Who gave me this job, this role?  No one but myself, though now I feel as though it's expected of me.  It's like once people accepted me in the role of humorist and fool, they couldn't accept me in any other role.  I got typecast by reality.  Admittedly, it's a role I feel very natural in, and I enjoy making people laugh.  But it also kinda limits me.  Whenever I feel down or upset, it's almost like I can't express that, because it doesn't meet everyone's expectations.  So I force the humor, even when I don't feel like being funny.  I do it for the benefit of others mostly, but I guess it's also for my own benefit.  I've always used humor and laughter as a defense mechanism, and years of being picked on in elementary and junior high school helped me form a wit and sense of humor that's quick and occasionally very barbed.  Admittedly, I didn't express most of my thoughts or comments when I was in those formative years; rather, they remained unspoken.  But in those years, I developed the sense of humor I have now--a little sarcastic, a little wry, a little odd.  When I got into high school and actually started speaking up, it surprised many of my old schoolmates.  Which I enjoyed--taking them on in a battle of wits became enjoyable, because most of them entered the contest unarmed in comparison.  In a way, the humorist part of me is self-created, self-imposed.  I want to be the funny one, the guy everyone thinks is humorous and entertaining and a proverbial hoot to talk to.  I want to have energy and wit and exuberance.  But I don't want to be so two-dimensional, so flat.  There are other aspects of my personality.  And hell, sometimes I just feel depressed and shouldn't have to keep making with the funny, right?  Admittedly, I don't want to be depressed as often as I was (for ridiculous reasons, it seems in hindsight) as an undergraduate.  But I don't think I can maintain some sort of manic energy and always be upbeat and funny.  It just doesn't work that way.  There was a reason for this rant, a very good reason, and now it all seems pointless.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bob Dylan, "Positively 4th Street"
