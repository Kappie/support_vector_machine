Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaw. And got 3,0 on biology and max garde was 3,0. Watever, i do not care that much and i don't wanna be titled "brain", like i am in the english class and some guys from school.  I got a book at the english course's libarary, named "The tragedy of american diplomacy", by William Appleman Williams, he's all i want to be in life.  "   We find genuine tragedy... only in that destruction which does not prematurely vut short development and success, but which, instead, grows out of success itself. Breakdown and failure reveal the true nature of things. In failure, life's really is not lost; on the contrary, here it makes itself wholly and decisively felt. there is no tragedy without transcendence. This trasnformation may go the way of deliverance, where man rises to rupreme reality through conquest of the tragic. Otherwise thi transformation may go the way of decline into irresponsible aestbeticism of the spector: man distracted, drifting, falling off into nothingness."         Karl Jaspers, Tragedy is not enough.
