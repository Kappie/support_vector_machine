If one wanted to accuse the editorial staff of TINAFT of occasionally deviating from its original brief (conveniently located to the lower right) it would not be too difficult.  I am both proud and sad to announce that today's post delves into the realm of the disappointing.  The object of my disappointment is the latest album from the UK group  urlLink Empress ,  The Sounds They Made .  To date, Empress, consisting of current and former members of  urlLink Hood , Boyracer, and Halkyn has made a number of excellent recordings for the Pehr and Geographic labels which are typically compared to albums by Low and Ida.  These comparisons are fair enough in extremely general terms but breaks down on further investigation, as such comparisons invariably do, in this case because Empress are suffused with a sparseness that Low and Ida lack, and because Low and Ida are boring, with one listenable album ( Secret Name ) between them.  The centerpieces of a typical Empress composition are pretty, simple, minor-key melodies; an almost extravagantly ascetic deployment of space; and the impression of extreme quiet even despite periodic shrieks of distorted feedback.  These qualities are in fact all present on  The Sounds They Made , as are ten truly great songs, but great songs do not a great album make.  No, because there is one further quality that Empress's prior output possessed which set it above the rest, which I have sneakily refrained from mentioning until now.  Empress, in common with early Godspeed You Black Emperor!, is one of the rare bands whose sonic effectiveness is improved by adversity.  GYBE! surrounded its first few recordings with static, distortion, and odd voice-overs, giving the effect of a weakly received radio transmission.  Similarly the space between the notes on the  Homeward Sounds  EP is not quiet;  it is blanketed with a thin sheet of noise that likewise creates and aura of age and distance.   The Sounds They Made  lacks this quality, and it is this very lack which makes the album such a disappointment.  The album is naturally not a bad one.  The songs on it are all excellent, it is more the circumstance of their recording rather than their execution which is at fault.  To be sure, this album sees Empress develop elements in their sound which are probably better left uninvestigated.  On the track "All Is New Glow", clicktronic buzzes come unexpectedly and unwelcomely to the fore;  all over the album the tone of the keyboard is somehow rendered cloyingly sweet.  Most noticeably, the icy static hiss which lurked at the corners of previous albums has been tamed to no worthwhile effect.  Perhaps this is the result of newfound fondness for things digital;  perhaps it is because Empress's appetite for noise is being satisfied through other channels (Halkyn?).    Change and growth are of course necessary in music.  On their latest album Empress have moved forward their songwriting and playing, making the album musically quite essential, but simply by making what would certainly seem to be minor technical improvements they have done great damage to the core of their sound.
