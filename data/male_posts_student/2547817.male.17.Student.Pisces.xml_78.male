Have to do the literature essay which is a week overdue by today. Also, 33 pages of the economics t.y.s. After that, in order of priority for homework, is a tamil essay about formal education vs vocational training which is due tomorrow, followed by a human geog essay on migration. And to top it all off, I've got an economics test on theory of demand, supply, elasticity and cross elasticity of demand and supply and goodness knows what else AS WELL AS a human geog test on a lot of stuff that I never understood to begin with!  Haha! Welcome to my world... again. And what am I doing? Writing my blog... that's what.. duphus. Have spoken to the authorities with whom I need to  clear up various issues. Sorry, can't mention names or anything implicative. But of course, I can't stop you from thinking can I? Sometimes I feel contemptuous, like 20 seconds ago, and then now, I reel remorseful for my emotional state 20 seconds ago. Damn... Oh, btw, I'm thinking of going to drama, where I'd be able to utilize and improve my dramatic ability. I've already got the Fairfield choir alumni, so there's where I get my vocal upkeep from. So in the end, I'm improving in tandem rather than an unbalanced crescendo in my aesthetic ability. Will ponder further.  I want to bring Dawn back to church. It's time I woke my ideas up and worked along the lines of the great commission. Chilled with her after cycling till 1120 Friday night. We talked about things and things. She's brave. Not really frightened or spooked by things in general. I sure am. She's just a friend.  Will finish talking to Hitomi and then get to work. Please pray for me, dear reader, that I can handle things and not crack.  Still miss Hazel. It's been 4 months and 29 days. I'm beginning to doubt if I should wait, and if it's worth the wait.  Hold thy desperate hand! Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art, yet thy tears are womanish and thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast.
