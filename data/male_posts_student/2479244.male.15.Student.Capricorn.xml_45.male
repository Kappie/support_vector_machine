It happens when I sit down for a while, and then abruptly stand up.   So what does it feel like? I stand up, and nothing feels wrong. My feet are on the ground and my mind is on something less important. But I feel it in my fingers first. They feel like they are swelling, like blooding is flowing into them and expanding them. I know something is wrong, and I stay still. My eyes open and I feel the area above them swell a bit, pressing down on my eyeballs. Next it comes to the inside of my elbows. The start to tingle and get that same expanding feeling as my digits, and now I can really feel it. My neck starts to get a lifeless, floating feeling, followed by a rush of heavy matter pressing on it. Now I'm swaying back and fourth, trying to stay up. I can't feel my knees. Then my ankles go away. I'm standing on my feet, but I have no legs, and I can't do it for much longer. My vision starts to pulse from a blurry wide area, to a sharp small area, and my head starts to float off my body. My knees buckle and I fall to the ground, but I put my hands out in time to save my face from the ground. When I'm on the ground, I get a feeling of euphoria, the kind you get when you first lie in your bed and you are very tired. I smile. I am feeling better. But that feeling is followed by a pulsating headache.  It's a very strange feeling, I kind of like it.
