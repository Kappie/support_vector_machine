I'm about ready to explode, it's so damn boring!  -  I've been slacking off on my guitarring, as usual.  I need to learn a few new songs.  -  Geez, where did all of this wind come from?  I mean, sheesh!  I start walking from school, and the wind's blowing me all over the place.  -  I skipped fourth period last Friday.  Weighed Spanish and a second lunch, and it really wasn't a hard decision.  Plus, I didn't miss anything important, so, it's cool.  I just need to make up the time with that stupid Language Tutor.  Damn I wish Algebra came after lunch, if you catch what I mean.  -  I've started training again.  I have decided that I am going to run in the Boston Marathon when I'm 18.  I guess the WASL is good for something.
