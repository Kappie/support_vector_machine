I tried to do Top ten of the season, but there are too many damn subplots so we're going with fifteen.  Here's the final list: RERUN: Sports Night "Quo Vadimus" 1. Pilot 2. Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc 3. A Proportional Response 4. Five Votes Down 5. The Crackpots and These Women 6. Mr. Willis of Ohio 7. The Short List 8. In Excelsis Deo 9. He Shall, From Time to Time 10. Celestial Navigation 11. Six Meetings Before Lunch 12. Let Bartlet Be Bartlet 13. Mandatory Minimums 14. Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics 15. What Kind of Day Has It Been  August 27th will hopefully be a CutCon, anything we don't get to at the MovieCons will go there I want to STUFF the MONKEY!
