My coordination is quite good, Alex is here, and so in Jon, Dave went to bed, I beat him at C+C generals. ok, now Alex has left, and Jon has gone to bed, well, he's on msn..   I'll give u a raun down of my last few days. Friday was my last day at school, only a half day, wasn't that bad, afer that I went to Charl's house fora  nice gaterhing, it was cool, Charl, Jen, Charm, Alice, Hannah, Dave and Kathleen were there, we watched Pulp fiction and Se7en, Dave had to leave early though (piano lesson) but it was cool, after that I wnet back to Alice's house and we played Halo, and watched Scooby Doo, it was kinda cool.  Saturday, I had my clarinet lesson as normal, afterwatrds me and Davce met Charl and Alice in Croydon, we saw Scoodby Doo 2: Monsyter's unleased, that was alright, it wa sa happy cheesy happy chessy film, most fun. But that evening I went to Alice's, and we watched Res Evil, and the end of American Beatuy, and we also manged to play Halo, w0o! We're quite far now.  Ok, now no-opne is on msn, and it's 3:12, even though my computer clock is 1 hour slow, due to a computer upgrade, and and btw, Jon is home now, incase u hasn't noticed. Today was good, we played C+C Gernarals I beat Alex and Dave, it was cool, and we just finished playing Mario Party 4 with Drinkikng rules, why ddi I agree to that if I suck at it so much?  I've played alot of Unrealy Tornament 2004, it kicks theass, w0o! I can't think of much else to say, I'll try and keep you all updated with my Easter Holiday as much as possible, I hope I mentioned everything/everyone. Toodles.
