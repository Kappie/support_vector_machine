I thought for a while that we should just turn the whole area over there into one big sheet of glass.  And then I read something put up by Moe here and think that we have a person in charge that is slightly stupid and things are being handled about as badly as they possibly could.  Sometimes, I find myself wondering what kind of miracle it would take to call do-over and somehow change laws and what not and have Clinton work this shit out.  But alas, it is clear that I am somewhat uneducated on the whole situation and anything that has to do with it. So this is just a true perspective of an average American.  Anyway, you should do what will make you happy Moe.  And if spending time on the beach, writing and Leveling makes you happy, then so be it.
