Student: "The way you explained it to me?" Professor:"No, the way that it  is , as opposed to the way I explained it." Finally, a dose of laughter to counteract the monotony that can be our 9:30 a.m. Contracts class. Our professor is proving to have a sense of humor -- a dry one, yes, but at least it exists!
