There once was a girl from Shalott Who fell in love with Lancelot At the end of the day In a barge down she lay And floated out to Camelot  Yay! I am glad last week is over.   Fanfiction recommendation of the week ("You might not care, but I do."): "A Moment in Time" a Star Wars fic on fanfiction.net by Kazzy. It's only 11 chapters long. It's about a not-dead Padme and her twins hiding from the Empire. Very moving and true to the characters, even when they don't do what you want them to. And to boot, it has the Naberries in it! They yell and give hugs! And make food, of course. You know what happened to the only person who ever left that house hungry...   Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!
