A tornado touched down somewhere and it was raining so it got cancelled.  Gannon came back to my house and we did random stuff and talked about Jacob half the night.  The next day (today) we walked up the road to some little old house.  We walked through alot of tall weeds and grasses and stuff to the front porch only to find that the door was locked.  We went around back where the ceiling was caved in and went through that way.  I was caught off guard by a picture of a woman on a wall that someone had drawn on...freaked me out.  We went up stairs and looked through lots of pictures and papers and there was lots of writing on the walls but both the digital camera and camcorder died so...little help there.  Hurricane Charley (haha!) is coming today/tonight....I'M READY FOR HIM!  It'll probably end up as a little breeze but it's been raining on and off all day.  Well...that's about it.  Later.
