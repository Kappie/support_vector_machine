So sorry about that I know you all like reading my boring life for some odd reason... Well anyway I went to Courtney's yesterday and Melissa ended up riding her bike over to her house so we all hung out since her computer needs a new CDROM I couldn't put XP on it. We ended up putting in the Simple Plan DVD and watching part of that until Melissa had to leave... It was so funny, me and Courtney sang like every word of the DVD and when Melissa would know the words she would too. Then when Pierre came out in his undies Melissa is like is it folded up? It was so funny, then Courtney says yeah it has to be or it would be flopping out. Man that would be hot if it did that! Then we watched the music videos on the DVD so of course we started to sing along with them. When "Perfect" came on we all started singing so I recorded it on my cell it was so cool! We sang the whole thing "I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you, but you dont understand." man I LOVE THAT SONG! Then when I got home I ended up mowing the lawn some more, which I have to finish today after laundry gets done. Then I got online and talked to some people... Well the person that I wanted to get online did, you know who you are ;), then we talked and well lets just say things are closer now... :D So now today I am going to the Fair with Melissa and Courtney around four so that will be a good time, I'm going to ride a big scary ride I think, even though I'm a chicken!
