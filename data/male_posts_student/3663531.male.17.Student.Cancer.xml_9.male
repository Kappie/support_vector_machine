Told Dad I would like to go in about 15 minutes and he replied with the usual "no problem" kind of response. So I relax a bit, and suddenly realise I have to get going.  But where is Dad? I look out the window, and wouldnt you know it, the falcon is gone. At this time I am a bit peeved. My brother couldn't take me- the builder's trailer blocked his car.  So I begin to walk, fuming, and as soon as I turn the corner here comes the falcon.  So I get a lift only to be about 5 minutes late (better than when I forgot to go to class entirely) and settled in to watch a painfully boring  Pride and Prejudice . Anyway, get out of class, say a casual ciao to Annaleise and walk with Jason to the entrance. Along the way he asked me some weird questions about where I was. Apparently I "cracked the shits and left". I pointed out that when I  "crack the shits" people   bleed  .  I wish I spoke Spanish.
