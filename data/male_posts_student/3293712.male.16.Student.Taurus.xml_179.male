Albeit, it may be true but they did not know that when they made the statement so it doesn't matter.  Now, what's wrong with Planned Parenthood? It is a nonprofit organization that helps people. It is definately not the same organization that Sanger created. If you want to dig up dirt on groups that have no relevancy today, lets look at the Catholic Church. For example: the crusades. How many people died simply so the Pope could try to get rich? I'm pretty sure that more people died there than Sanger and Planned Parenthood could have ever managed to kill. Now you may say she actually has "killed" a lot more, that is debatable though while the deaths of the Crusades are pretty concrete. By pretty I mean definately.
