I used to be a Bojangles guy, but tonight it's quick blog, a bit on existentialism, and bed.    I get a day off soon.  I think.  I should.  I'm the only person left who hasn't taken one.  I would take tomorrow morning, but I've got to run errands and pick up a seven foot sub sandwich.  I'd rather buy books and sit my happy self at Borders or Barnes  Noble, possibly looking over new Harry Potter, but more likely reading up on the Introducing series from Totem Press.    I taught  urlLink Bowling for Columbine  tonight.  I love Moore's message, don't like his idea of vigilante celebrity, but am glad the left has a leader like him, even though he only incorporates the leftist of the left, but they need a leader, and while I don't like him personally he's a great leader for me.  Odd.  Anyway, really diverse and good comments from the kids, especially Kevin, one of the kids who thinks he's too cool to be here and too cool to learn.  Very smart, and made some great comments on the film.  Noah tried to get Forest to open his perception up and look at the possibility that Michael Moore was making some good points, and it worked to an extent.  The most impressive comment came from Adya, a camper I have yet to really talk to and feel bad that I haven't.    I throw about names here...Noah, Forest, Kevin...and no one knows who they are.  And I'm not about to explain it to you.  They're campers or camp staff or something or other.    It's a constant barrage of memories...so many of them remind me of people I know or knew or had contact with and the contact was memorable.  Daniel is a spitting image of Marshall McCammon, less the elongated beer belly, but just as clumsy and staunchly conservative.  Andy walks like Mike Maury.  Ryan is a short 20-20 visioned Tom Horton.  Student Noah is a louder version of my documentary partner Daniel.  Holly reminds me of my sister.  Victoria is a less obtrusive Laci Adams that I would enjoy hanging out with.  Seth looks like Knox Overstreet and acts like Daryl Burrows.  Cami has Katie's laugh.  Megan has Bonnie's wit.  Kevin is Dave McCormick who hasn't grown the human compassion.  Patrick looks like one of the Fell children but reminds me of Nick Dorothy.  Chris is a cross between Dan Wearsch and Leif Sherry.  Amanda is a pleasant Joy Mettam.  Forrest reminds me of a young Daniel Young.  Kallie looks like Demi Moore, but acts like Beth Carter, minus the religious indignation.  Lauren is Crystal Carter mixed with New Jersey.    All you do is ask them to never grow up, to keep the idealism, to keep having fun, and to save the world.  No pressure.
