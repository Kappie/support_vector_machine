Right now I'm just getting acquainted with things, specifically Interactive Data Language (IDL), and the week-to-week things that my job entails. My predecessor, Jon Ullman, is teaching me how to operate programs written by people who worked at Lockheed years ago to monitor the quality and quantity of data that TRACE gathers. The programs update the links at the bottom of  urlLink this site .  I know I sound like I'm boasting and that this stuff could sound very complex, but in reality my job thusfar has boiled down to running and trying to understand programs people wrote years ago, and writing my own trivial programs, all under the watchful eye of now-graduated seniors. For example, I made a number guessing game and a hangman game yesterday.  Work is kind of boring.
