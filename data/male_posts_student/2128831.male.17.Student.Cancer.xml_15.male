I was completely outed in my culinary class.  Like I was talking to this girl, Marisol and she asked if I was gay, and I was like yep I am.  So then, CJ and this other boi named Alvin ran around and was like Will is gay, so the of course like the whole class asked me if I was gay and I was like well yeppers!  So then all of the class was like how do you have sex, and I was like orally and anally how else would I have sex? And they freaked it was great! I got my grades with 11 days of absences I still got above a 3.0 GPA for this nine weeks, GO ME!!! So now to my new poem again thanks Jared, you are a greaaaaaat inspirer! Much love cutie!  In your...  Graceful is the world that which we spin In your embrace, I am tempted to sin Delightful is the paradise that we hold In your arms, I could never grow old Peaceful is the heaven that you have made In you kiss, I know love will never fade Tranquil is the place that blocks all outside noise In your gaze, I play with you alone no longer toys Wonderful is the rapture that is all for us In your watch, I can fulfill all of my lust Lovely is the site that is only for you and me In your grasp, I know that I truly I am free Restful is the place in which you and I exist In your heart, I know I will always subsist      ~~Will
