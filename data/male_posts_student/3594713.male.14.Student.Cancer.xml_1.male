Its almost the end of the first week of the holidays. They seem to be going so fast, I'm really dreading the start of school again :( But thats over another week away, so I'll try enjoy the rest of the holidays best I can, and try and foget about school, hehe. I know it won't make it go away, but at least for a little while I can think that I never have to go to school again. I'm a genius. Not.  Ok so the holidays so far. Well up until Tuesday, it was a pretty lazy couple of days. Stayed at home, playing the computer (the Sims, Age of Empires II, Grand Theft Auto III  Tuesday it was my 14th birthday!!! It was a pretty boring day actually, cos mum and dad were working, so it didn't really feel like my birthday, but o well.   Wednesday, we actually celebrated my birthday. We went to the movies, and saw Spiderman 2, it rocked. Even though it wasn't as good as the first one (I think sequels are always shit), it was still one of the best movies I've ever seen. Anyway, that night we went out for dinner for my birthday. The food was shit, still half frozen, but I got more presents (money ;)). Sometimes I wish people would have better creativity and motivation to buy me an actual present. Don't get me wrong, money is cool, you can buy what you want, but it isn't as exciting when you just get an envelope, compared to a wrapped present that you have no idea what it is. But nan gave me another cactus (hehe, I'm a cactus collector), some ornaments for my other cactus gardens, and $20. so that was nice.  Thursday was another boring day of lazing around the house, not much there.  And today practically the same ;)  Anyway, will blog soon.
