As I've said, I hope Dubya gets elected now so I've 2 fresh ones to pick in '08 instead of being forced Republican by Kerry's presidency. It might also get some of those old croaker judges out of there. And I think Dubya stands a chance, being as it was about the worst possible political climate in the spring and Kerry couldn't gain any more than he had. Now that gas is going down and the economy is going up, Bush is bound to make gains by November.  Whatever.
