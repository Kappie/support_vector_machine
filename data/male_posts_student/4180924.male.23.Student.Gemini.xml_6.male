Here's the ad:  Let’s get the good news out of the way first: I’m not in terrible debt (just some student loans and a small car loan) and I don’t have an STD (one actually has to have intercourse to get one of those). I take showers on a daily basis and wear deodorant. I work out at least three times a week and am in decent shape, but I still drink beer. I’m not skinny or very fat, but somewhere in the middle.  Now, the bad news (and there’s plenty of it): I’m not particularly attractive. Also, I am far from being a pillar of orthopedic health. Soon I am going in for my second ankle surgery in three years and last year I had part of my shoulder removed. Oh, and did I mention that I’m 23 years old? Many of my friends say that I’m the most accident-prone person that they know, and I cannot disagree with that. Murphy’s Law dictates my life, which brings me to my emotional stability. Or lack thereof. I drink way too much, smoke too many cigarettes, and take too many pills in a vain attempt to drain out the crippling emotional pain. I don’t date. Ever. It's not really my style to ask someone out. It's generally not my style to speak to an unknown female unless it's an absolute necessity. Instead, I like to just let those feelings foster for months upon end until the whole situation culminates in me getting hurt and never speaking to the other person again. This scenario has taken place numerous times throughout my life and the prospects for change aren't that wonderful. I am probably the most socially inept person who has ever lived when it comes to the whole issue of the other sex. To put it bluntly – I am simply terrified. You'd think that 40-year old computer nerds who still live with their mothers and can't wait for DragonCon every year would be worse than me. But I don't think so. I don't see how they can be, really. In all actuality, we're probably on about the same level of loserdom and being-alone-forever-dom. Just replace the Star Trek addiction with Law and Order: SVU or XBox NCAA Football and we're the same damn person. It's sad really.
