Sweetness though....last week was one of the most hectic weeks ever, and today started off so nice and easy. Great start for a week. No work or anything....just watching the day drift by slowly....ahh yes that awesome feeling of "yup I'll just sit back here and watch the day go back." It's as enjoyable as...mmm coffee...mmm tea....  So my day today started with the awakening from my 6 hour slumber at around 730 or so. It was kinda weird last night. For some reason I didn't feel like sleeping, and decided to pull out my WOW Worship 2001 CD from my dusty CD rack...  I have no clue why either...when I bought it in gr. 7....I had never liked it thinking the music sucked. Hmm guess my music appreciation has broadened now though. It led to me listening to it for almost an hour, wondering why the heck I had never listened to this stuff earlier. Apparently Stacie Orrico existed back then...and Rebecca St. James had an awesome dance song "Reborn." Oh yeah that's the other thing...  OMG THERE IS CHRISTIAN DANCE MUSIC! I found a new brand of music to add to my already growing blob of listening music =P.  WHY DID I NEVER STUMBLE ON THIS STUFF EARLIER!? I don't know, but I'm sure as hell gonna be going to Upper Room or Creation soon to grab more =). But yeah...after reviewing a bit of PDL...I quickly fell asleep as I was dead tired...  So now away from that flashback. I quickly headed to the music room to savour what practice time I could for my trombone solo, and then studied the wee bit before the test we had today. Mr. Boldt was the weird person he was...some ways I think he's worse than McCumber. He sounds like a drunk at the front of the room when he talks to us. Well the music test was a joke...I only forgot one or two things but the other things were really easy. PHHT music history.....boring and useless =P. So 75 minutes of pure crap.  Then science. YES signs of year end is approaching with textbook checks and test dropping. UTTER SWEETNESS!!! So I get to drop my first test which I got 73%...yes that was my lowest mark and also we had some assignment to do that was pretty easy. got 95% on ecology test...yeah signs of the year end is approaching everywhere...which whoops ass =). Not much else happened that I can recall...think that was it.  Lunch: practiced solo. Yeah me and Arjun managed to get through the whole song! Dave Rutt then owned my song...sight reading it *since he played it last year.* Gah...to think I have to be that image next year in senior band....er in two years. Blargh.  Bio class: had Kevin Luzak's sister come in and talk to us about organ transplanting. I think I may sign a donor card...why not save someone else's life if I could...I mean I'm dead anyways...not like I'm gonna be using my parts anymore.  English: Cafe thing got scrapped for today since no one brought food. But we played this game where we had to identify ourselves from FGT....and then get in groups to make a skit. Ours was pretty weird...with me, Lilian, Lucy, Rachel, and Kelly *I think that's her name* doing the skit where Ruth gets taken back to Whistle Stop w/ Big George, Julian and Idgie * I was Julian =P.* Yeah pretty weird class...and we had to tape the sheets we had the other day about someone from FGT into a big tapestry...dunno why....many of us thought it was a waste of resources.  Getting home....I slept for the majority of the early evening. But before that....started listening to the same CD I was listening to last night and doing my devos. Hehe today I also realized that God had always made time for me to do devos......I just never saw it. After school everyday....I have nothing better to do normally so I SC. But honestly that game's gettin' a bit old...plus playing it for 3 hours is kinda lame sometimes. So yeah the one hour after school now...I think it's gonna be my devo time. Spent a good one hour studying Mark 12 after reading a section in PDL which led me to read my Bible then. And then sleep I went =)...  *Waking up at 7:30pm or so*  The time from waking up till now has consisted of watching game 4 between Calgary and Tampa *where Calgary is losing at the moment this blog was made grrr...* and also blogging, dinner, and gonna start math review soon hehe.  Anyways I'm out now. Oh yeah and on a side note...    I'M RANKED #107 ON GOOGLE IF YOU SEARCH "Daily Cup O' Joe."   Later.
