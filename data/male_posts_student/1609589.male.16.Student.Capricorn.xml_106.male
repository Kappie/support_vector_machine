Was it worth it, guys? I think so.  Matt, i should have told you this, but i think at 8:00 last night(when the concert started) you should have set fire to the beach for keeping you away. Ha! Stoopid galveston.  Wow... my birfday is in exactly 5 months!  I'm sorry that i'm not pissed off at anything today, i'm just in a good mood. Trust me, i'll be back to my tortured teenage self tomata.
