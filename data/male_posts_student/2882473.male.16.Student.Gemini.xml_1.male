Well, as I always say: 'When you can't blaim anyone, blaim America'. Ok, so it's the first time I've said that.... I shall now proceed to blaim America for all my troubles. 1) Global Warming. America/Bush refuses to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the greenhouse effect, possibly eventually destroying the planet. 2) Fossil Fuels. America continues to use fossil fuels as their largest source of energy. These will run out in a few hundred years, and then we will HAVE to use others. They also pollute. (ok, England also uses a lot of these, but I wont mention that :) ) 3) Energy wastage. 1% of American energy is used up because computers are left on overnight, normally doing nothing, and for no good reason. Apparently. This is also using up those presious fossil fuels. 4) Gun Crime. With the legalisation of guns in America, I wont be surprised if the UK soon does the same. American culture is also to blaim for our rise in gun crime. 5) America is one of the only countries not to sign an agreement to provide minimum standards for children 6) Evil corporations. McDonalds and CocaCola, possibly the 2 most evil corporations have invaded the UK and are poisoning our people. 7) Obesity. Due to McDonalds and fast food from America, about 1 in 3 adults will be obese by 2020, or something like that. 8) World hunger. I heard that the American military budget is enough to feed the entire third world. There is no way they can possibly need all that money on the military. 9) English. First they steal our language. Then they change our words. Then they use a really annoying high-pitch accent. 10) Stupidity. A significant proportion of American High-School children can not name a country in Asia.   With America looking so 'cool', many people from the UK wish to copy their lifestyle. I don't want this to happen, is the summary of my rant. To summarise the summary: England is turning American. To summarise the summary of the summary: America is a problem. That's all folks!
