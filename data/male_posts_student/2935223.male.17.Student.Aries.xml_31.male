I never thought I could hurt sumone so bad....but apparently I can...I didn't really want to...and I STILL don't want to, but for the moment..I really need to figure things out. so.....I still have feelings for Tina, but Keli is a very special person to me also.....unfotunately....I hurt Keli really bad...and I don't think that Tina will ever come back...so....I think I pretty much F***ed myself over..... damn I wish I wasn't such a retard..... Peace-Out!  Spense
