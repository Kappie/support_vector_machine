There is this one shitty metalcore band called the Beverly Beer Belly's :) That made me laugh - they pretty much suck. There was some lo-fi stuff that sounded like death cab for cutie or pinback. I would really like to get into something like. Just some good slow/soft heart felt music about deeper things than girls and love. Maybe a celebration of love instead of the heart-break of life. I've had my heart-breaks... I think there is more to everything than that or this or those. All in moteration, even the thoughts.  I am pretty freaked out about the FOG! Everytime I have been to the Central Valley and the Bay Area the FOG is super intense. I have only delt with fog like that in texas maybe a total of three times. There is a whole season of this morning and evening FOG. I should probably learn how to drive in it. There was a 78 car accident in Bakersfield because of the FOG. That is in the southern part of the central valley close to LA but its all the same FOG.  I almost have every fucking piece of paper faxed and overnighted to the apartment complex we are moving into. I hope we qualify becase I would hate to look for a place with just a few days notice. This shit has taken over a week so far. I know we had trouble at the last apartment we lived in. They always gave us hell about shit and then never fixed a damn thing. I hated that place and for some reason I think that I'm gonna hear about it from these people in California and then have to explain myself to them.  I am getting excited about the upcoming road trip!   current mood: super stoked! current music: edward applebee and jagjaguwar records music
