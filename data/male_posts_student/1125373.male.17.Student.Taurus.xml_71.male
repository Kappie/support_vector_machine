MOL project turned out well....if not that...the cookies were good  Wow...if you asked me a year ago how i think things will go....man things have changed so much that i look at my wall that has pictures on it and realize how long ago they were. I mean i have pictures of Ross and Steve from the Colorado Trip. But then i'm reminded of how people surprise me. I look at this beautiful picture of a yellow/pink rose that Chris Flowers took and i stand in awe...he gave it to me for my birthday...Then i look at movie tickets and how long ago those were.   I miss my boys...I miss Kyle, I miss Ross, I miss Matt, Heck i even miss Ashton. Well at least Kyle and Ross call me and I see Matt sometimes.  I've had so many problems with guys the past few months. It just seems I can't grasp a great guy even for a short while. I sit and wonder if God is testing me or if I'm just one of those girls boys don't want to date. *sigh*
