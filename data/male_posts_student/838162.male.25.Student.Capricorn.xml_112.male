No notice and no further follow up offered...for good? and what about the other? left behind?  Too many questions, not enough answers... now flying in my mind.  I don't want to dwell too much. I can't dwell too much. I can't afford to dwell too much. I won't allow it...I just can't.  It's time and yet I don't hunger. I'm not afraid of the answers, only of not having them at all...
