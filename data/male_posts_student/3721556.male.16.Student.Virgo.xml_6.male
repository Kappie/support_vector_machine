If ya don't know what straight edge is, here's the scoop. Straight edge is a lifestyle where you devote yourself to stopping the spread of drugs. No smoking No drinking No drugs of any kind, and when you do those things, or even worse, SUPPLY those things to others, you loose your rights as a human being, and are shunned.  Anywho's gonna be some real cool bands playing there, Including Sham69, Warhungry,the 4skins, and tons others! all the bands there are oi bands, so it's gonna be alot of fun. I won't be attending though, gotta spend as much time as possible with casey before i leave for evil boot camp :(.
