Well, NASCAR is a lot like Iraq – you begin really fast, go around and around in circles and end up the same place you started.  2. Oil prices are now at their highest levels in 20 years, so today Exxon declared the war in Iraq a complete success.   3. The New York Times reported this week that Michael Jackson is $200 million in debt and his financial advisers have ordered him to cut back on spending. Let me tell you something, if you’re $200 million in debt, the first thing you do is fire the financial advisers!   4. The president’s staff told him nobody would suspect that he’d fly off to Iraq. And Bush said, "Well, sure, since it’s Thanksgiving everybody will think I’m going to Turkey."   5. He gave quite a stirring speech to the troops in Baghdad, saying "We will stay until the job is done." He then hopped on a plane and flew back to Texas.
