We don't need rain, I don't want snow anymore since spring break is just over a week away, and it's still too cold for biking long distance. damn March always sucks.  Well, its about time some sunlight showed itself. Even yet, I spent a good amount of time in the library today checking out a slew of books. Last night I tried, but the library closed at 8:30 instead of 9:00. stupid budget cuts! you can all blame good ol' Pawlenty for that. As for homework: English, English, oh-and English. Yep. Thank you Mrs. Molin.  As fate has it, I will not be going to the JSS this Saturday. I would probably get my ass beat because my deck isn't completed, namely glimmervoids. Wouldn't have worked anyways-I've got a drum lesson that morning.  Haven't talked about music in a while, so here's some new stuff: "The Blues", Eric Clapton "Wander this World", Johnny Lang "Jimmy Eat World", Jimmy Eat World  Granted, it's not new, but its new from my collection. In other words, I ripped off the library...lol.  I resent English greatly...
