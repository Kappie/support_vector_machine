Every night we would tell eachother random stories as we always do until her parents yelled at her to go to bed. I (in no particular order) went to a lot of malls, bought gifts for the whole family, ate a LOT of yummy food (see All My Loving 2 posts down), drank a lot of piña coladas, swam, read, browsed the internet, fixed computers, hugged and kissed the girlfriend, went to a Chivas soccer game, rode in the car, napped, watched every existing episode of Hey Arnold, spoke lots of spanish, found out Martha is really getting a bellybutton ring, bought the ring, stole Mr. Sanchez's feng shui rock, went to a factory, tried a beer, watched traditional mexican dance and El Rey Leon, got bitten by mosquitos, got sick, impaled my foot with a big piece of broken plastic, said "pshhh" a lot and cheerleaded the girlfriend, played barrel of monkeys with earrings, took a horse and carriage tour of historical Guadalajara, saw the new house, got me a shiny new chupón, laughed a lot and cried a little. And probably a hundred other things that I'm forgetting.  I was with her 24/7 for 11 days, we slept in the same "room" every night in the apartment and right next to her at the hotel. Everything on that list above, I did with her. It was a very pleasant 11 days.  On the 10th day I was scheduled to leave Mexico. My "insider" at Delta had assured me that I would have no trouble whatsoever leaving Guadalajara, and that I might have to stay overnight in Atlanta. Big deal. But when I got to the airport, every single possible flight out of Mexico to Atlanta was full, all detours accounted for. My only option was to fly to L.A. at 6:00 PM, then to Atlanta, finally arriving in Charlotte the next day at 12:00 PM. Thanks, but no thanks. So, my mom did what she always does, she freaked out and bought me a real ticket home, putting her out of $530 bucks. Ouch! The next day I did the whole thing over again, but when it was time for me to go.... I wasn't ready. It caught me off gaurd. I turned to Martha. We hugged eachother for the longest time, it made me so happy... but after I turned around I almost started to cry... No matter how weird of a couple we say we are, no matter how much we fight, no matter what anybody else out there says or how far away we live.... life just isn't the same without her. She's got a piece of my heart. Martha will be back for Thanksgiving break though. Sigh...  Well, soccer practice has officially begun. 8:00-11:00 every day, with the Wilmington trip coming up on Monday. I have a scrimmage tomorrow but our team hasn't even touched the ball, we've just been conditioning... we'll see how it goes. Martha, will you wear that autographed jersey for me for good luck?  A special shout out to Mike on his first day as the Country Day punter!  Oh yeah, and everyone wish Martha luck tomorrow. She's getting her wisdom teeth out :P  Adios, JD
