I applaud their decision, in the sense that the detainees will have access to the court system. In my opinion, it didn't make sense that because they were in Cuba, that they did not have access to courts. All U.S. bases and embassies, etc. are considered U.S. soil so how could the administration argue that because the detention "center" was in Cuba they had no right to the courts. You can't have it both ways, either it is considered US soil or it is not. If it is, which is the case, then they may as well be in Delaware as far as their rights under the Constitution are concered. As emotionally charged as this issue is, with the chance that many terrorists are in the camps, these are the times when are rights are tested most. I believe had the administration won this case, then we would all be in danger.
