Ironic isn’t it I have the same feelings that she has for Mark, probably in the same magnitude too. Trying to get some one out of your m1nd isn’t easy; I guess having some one by your side is supposed to help. I don’t know what to feel anymore; at least C doesn’t hurt like Dawn did. I don’t know if she loves me, I mean people usually take everything in the wrong sense just because you are nice to them. I guess I did to with C. I took everything in the wrong sense. How I wish that things would be different. Maybe if I run away it will all become ok. Leave this world of the internet behind; take away their names from my list.  Find something to do, like they say what you cant see cant hurt you, so If I don’t see C anymore I wont think of her, she doesn’t see me I wont be a the curse I am to everyone. I bring bad luck to everyone. Mum and dad haven’t had a happy marriage, was it because I was there ?My sister didn’t have a happy teen, wasn’t I there .She’s happy now, she’s got her life and everything’s good for her. Maybe if I just stop speaking to everyone that would make everyone and everything better.  I’ve been with angel for a year nothing’s improved in her life. Life went bad for C after I met her. And Dave, Life wasn’t going his way when I was with him. Maybe if I don’t see him before September, he’ll make it through the army. The day the letter I wrote, reached Dave was the day he got discharged from the army. My mums never been happy, I’ve been around her always.   Holy god this cant be true, can it?   I was on a lookout for accommodation. You kinda expect all the Indians to help, so I went to these bunch of Indians who have taken up a house some where on De Grey street and ask them if I can stay with them for about a month, and I wouldn’t have any problems paying them the desired rent. The guy I spoke to said that I’ll have to take up the matter with their Real Estate Agency, instead of them (I was like WOOOOT . man can ya’ll accommodate me say in the living room for about 3 weeks , damn I was even willing to pay rent … fair enough I guess I’m gonna go back home broke as a duck now. I asked another guy before that and he was like I live in a very small room, and there’s not enough space for himself … (yeah right like its said no one helps, I mean why would they care if I were on the streets , no one cares . no one but family )    NoFx sung a song called “Drugs Are Good” and years later they wrote another song called “Whoops I Od’d”. Ionic ?
