I had leftover Chinese food at Zak's and watched  Sleep With Me .  On Saturday I went on my "date" (quotations are used because it didn't seem like a date because there were four other girls with us) with Brittany.  It was alright, I suppose.  We went to the Sasser Street Dance which just ended up being a hangout with most of the people at Lee County that I hate.  Other than that, the date went alright and Brittany is a nice girl who I'd like to get to know a little better.  But I doubt that will ever happen because two of her friends, Tara Russell (who the hell is that?) and Kayla Deck (a drunk retard who tried to pump gas while smoking a cigarette) hate me and thinks Brittany could do better.  Oh well, too each his (or her) own.  If she wants to pursue a relationship with me, then the ball is in her court.  I took my AP Language test and U.S. History EOCT test today.  The former was expected to be difficult while the latter was not a test, but a mere stupidity exam.
