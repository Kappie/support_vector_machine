There is one story Tyke could tell but he has decided he isn't going to just cuz it would take a long time and Tyke has been doing a pretty good job of blogging lately, in his mind, so he will take a night off.  Tyke and his 1st period group drew Guernica 4.0 which if you know what he is referring to, then you will laugh but otherwise you will not think it's very funny.  In 4th period today Tyke got there and a girl was "having some problems" so the class was told to take 1st lunch.  So they did and then Tyke's crew, Amed, Dr. Phil, Purdy, Tank, etc. all went to Quizno's for lunch.  Tyke still isn't a big fan of Quizno's.  Subway is by far the best.  Then they came back and ended up getting let out of class like 15 minutes early so they just went out to Tyke's car and played a fun game with a little feather.  After school Tyke went to Mr. Lynn (teacher at IHS) and got his speeding ticket community service hours signed off.  He asked Tyke a few questions that Tyke didn't have the answers to but Tyke just made up answers and he signed them off.  Then he went out to his car and was about to leave when Piggy J came up and they talked for a little and then Tyke invited him to go shopping with him for a little while.  So they went to Mills Music for Piggy and then they went to Blockbuster where Tyke got Hamlet for his mom.  Then they went to Ted Meyer's and Tyke got a really random card and a present for Tina that he wanted to get before.  Then they went back to the school and Tyke went home where he ate a lot of Pringles.  Then he fell asleep while watching the Heat beat the Hornets.  Then he did some soliloquizing for Senyohl.  Speaking of Senyohl, here is something that Amed wrote for...well, he just wrote it for fun apparently.  To ruffle or not to ruffle: that is the question Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of a senile bitch, Or to take chairs against a sea of senility, And by opposing end it?  To wait, to mourn; No more: and by waiting to say we suffer The heart-ache and the thousand naturals shocks that hearing her talk about her horses is Heir to.  'Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd.  To wait, to mourn, to mourn perchance to daydream: aye, there's the rub; For in that daydream of longing for lunch what splendid wetdreams may come When we have shuffled the old bitch off our backs Must give us pause, there's the lack of respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the whips and scorns of that class, The bitch is always wrong, but the proud man's contumely The pangs of despising that bitch, the law's dela,y The insolence of her attempting to teach and the spurns That  patient merit of the unworthy takes, When  she herself might her quietus make With a bare bodkin exposing her stupidity? Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat  Under the fuzzy lights of her retarded class No student returns unaware of her idiocy, it puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills that we have ourselves Than fly into that dumbass class again? Thus our conscience tells us to go kill her and not be cowards, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sickle'd over with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great ruffling and moment With this regard the ruffle turns awry, And loses its effect because people on the other side of the room fuck up - Soft you Now!  The unfair Senyohl! Dyke, in thy orisons Be all your sins remembered, biatch!  Tyke didn't edit it at all so it is all Amed there.  Well, Tyke is hungry.  Actually no he's not.  But he's gonna eat anyway.  And just finish off his Tuesday night for on Wednesday he has two activities he is looking forward to.  Sleep.
