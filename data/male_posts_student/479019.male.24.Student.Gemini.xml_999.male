Although I did see Rick Bassman of UPW in the store today and there were talks of a coup d'etat.  I'm feeling like this summer isn't nearly as fun as it could or should be. Not enough madness is going on. No drama. Not as much wild stuff... hopefully next weekend will make up for it.  Now playing:  Marilyn Manson  - Beautiful People  There's a part of me that wonders if I'm being the person that I want to be. Not as much the part of me doing what I want, but me actually being me. Who exactly is Albert? More than what I do, beyond what I say I believe. I've said that people don't really know me, but then again do I really know myself?  ***
