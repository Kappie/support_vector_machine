Right well, the night was decent. Got very pished, had a few laughs wae cooney and many little asides about the pish my family talks. But.. the real shock came with a couple of texts from both danny and, gasp, claire.  Danny and johann had wemt to ashleighs party but it ended early i imagine so they text ,e and asked to cp,e to my brothers thing, to which i obliged. So they both came and it was all good. But then,, claire text me and asked if her, pauline (!!!!) and carolann cld come as well, to which i jumped at the chance as u wld imagine. So they turned up and my night was complete. I was already slaughterred by the time they got there and i dont even remember what i was saying at all but it was cool, dont think i made too much of an arse of myself. Anyway, after the night was over and they all went home i was completely abandoned by my family and left with some obscure family members tht i dont really know, which was rather uncomfortable. I was meant to be going to Capos with all of them but seeing as i dint know them i decided jst to go home, prob much to the annoyance of the ppl i was with who wanted to continue the night and not be stuck with a wee guy like me. Does any of this make sense? I cant even read this back to myself so ill not even try. Ill wake in the morning and try to decifer this but to no avail. Bye anyway.
