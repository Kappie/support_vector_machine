Predicatable really, since I was at work all day, but it's really nice to sit outside at about eight in the evening with a cup of coffee in hand sunning yourself. Aah. Trouble is, though, I got woken up at six this morning eith the sun streaming through my window as bright as midday. Wouldn't have minded but my day today doesn't even start until eleven.  Funny incident at work yesterday. The Senior Sales, who's eighteen, engaged, but not bad looking was walking through the shopping centre when some strange person crept up behind her and pinched her arse! Being the sort of person she is, she turned straight round and gave him a wallop round the head. As soon as this had happened, she realised that the person she had just belted was none other then her fiance (and she's got a wicked right arm). How much wuld I have given simply to be there.  Was watching the ice hockey on TV last night. As there was no game they showed  The Season , the documentary series about my team following them through the course of the season that's just finished (well it has for us- we were knocked out embarrasingly last week). Even though it's been more than a week since we were knocked out, I still can't get over it. I know that every year you think that this is your year but this year.... ah, well, only six months to wait for the next one (I hope).  Enjoy the sunshine  Jack
