I dare not go into too much detail, I'll just ruin that new pacemaker of mine into extreme anguish, as well as my syntax. Just, well, I don't think the goal shouldn't have been allowed, and I can't wait for Shaun Wright-Phillips to take over the reigns at right midfield when David Beckham retires, he was abysmal, and his 2 penalty misses in the competition would, if have been taken properly, have seen us through.  Anyway, quite a few people are out of the local area at the moment, including Thomas and Jen and Frances and Anna to name a few. So tonight I guess I'll just be at home watching the start of Glastonbury on TV (whilst trying to spot gorgeous Thomas hehe) and mulling over who Chelsea should buy in the remaining close season now that the players are available to talk transfers, as the come hither in drips and drabs. My bet is Rooney and Joaquin, and if not Joaquin like expected, then Shaun Wright-Phillips.  Apart from those couple of things or so, there hasn't really been much going on at my life at the moment, well for this week anyway; I had enough time last to make the blog even more professional with even more links (well this happening after I destroyed the HTML language yet again trying to add extortionist links in my crazy way). Now my plan is just to pester Blogger until they allow free funky "splash introductions" like the one's you get for accomplished rock bands or the Chelsea FC web page (click link in my name). Ooooh I guess I do have another plan to do this weekend, to go and see Ian and get pissed, and think long and hard about coursework for all three subjects (bar philosophy who can't get the finger out and just  GIVE  it to us) and finally to see whether I can broaden the style/vocabulary and general literary verity in the blog writing, and so I envisage quite a few more literature issues coming, one's which will be a just and deserved carry on from the  Swimming In The Haze  series. Well this and in addition too - official Chelsea management game 2003/2004, and convincing the football faithful that (yes this guy's name being mentioned again) Shaun Wright-Phillips is worth buying as a right-midfielder. Sure to be a roller-coaster ride *sobs* . . . xBuBzx
