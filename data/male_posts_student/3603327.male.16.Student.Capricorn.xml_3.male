Well first off i'll tell you all what happened. Me and Spencer went there at 8 and no one was there so we went to A sound to look around. Spencer was playing with a cd deck that i thought was gonna start working on the stereo so i left him to play with it. We went to the video cameras and Spencer thought he would be smart and pointed one of them at the t.v's that were playing Finding Nemo so people who looked at the camera would think it was playing a movie:) haha what a kidder he is. So anywho after we did that he went to the weird vending machine in A sound..... your probably thinking what im thinking *why would A sound have a vending machine* well the answer is... i have no idea. Now we were walking back and...oooooo i forgot to tell you about when we were walking there. We were leaving and i turned the corner and started skipping singing "were off to see the wizard" haha and people in a car started laughing at me. But o yah we were walking back and we had fun because we were walking back hehe. So back to the show. We sat inside and threw a bouncy ball Spencer had to eachother and it kept falling and Spencer kept getting it. Finally i went to throw it at him and he missed... well he didnt know i was throwing it haha;) and so it rolls under a girls foot so he says he'll wait till she moves to get it and than the girl stands up, notices the ball, and than picks it up and stuffs it in her pocket... hahahaha that was so funny. While we were sitting at the table we were thinking of what ska people would be called and i remembered from some website that they were called SKAnks so we know call ourselves SKAnks lol. it was fun. But yah thats pretty much everything that happened tonight and im about to go to bed so good night everyone!!  *-*Matty*-*
