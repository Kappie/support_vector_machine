Walking past Ben’s room I noticed he wasn’t in bed….hmm…that’s interesting, for once he actually got up early or maybe I just got up late…*sigh*…   Rubbing the sleep from my eyes I slouched on the chair and sat for a while listening to my own breathing…it seemed so quite…odd…   Scratching my head in concentration I began to think of possible solutions to as why the house was so quite, I wonder where Ben is, I still need to get him back for the last trick he pulled…urgh!...   My mind raced with images of the other day, I had to admit though Ben was a darn good actor…*sigh*…   I sighed heavily and motioned towards the kitchen to fix something to eat, there was a note on the bench…   ‘Gone out to work. -Ben’   Upon reading it my eyes bulged and my mind raced with thoughts…Ben had a job?! I wonder what he did. Was it a professional job?   Wow…   I stood in silence taking it all in…flabbergasted; I didn’t realize the knock on the door…   ‘Hello?! Ben! Open up!’ I heard a voice call from the other side.   Snapping out of my thoughts I gathered my senses and briskly  walked towards the door…   *knock, knock, knock, Bang, Bang, Bang!*   ‘Bennie? You in there?’ The male voice asked again.   My eyebrow jerked up…Bennie?.. What the hell? Was that Ben’s nickname?..   My mouth curved into a slight grin as I realized who was knocking on the door…must be Ben’s friend…I could gather information and use it against Ben if he ever tried anything stupid…hmm…interesting…   I unfastened the locks followed by a ‘click’ and opened the door for the stranger without hesitation…   I recognized the man instantly from Crystal Bar, he was one of   Ben’s friends I had seen when he got me fired.   His features were quite girlish but cute in a way…his broad shoulders and attire distinctively showed that he was a guy and his skin was like porcelain…*sigh*…he even had better skin than me…   ‘Uhh…hi…who are you?’ The guy asked before chuckling nervously.   I gave out a sigh of relief secretly after realizing he didn’t recognize me…   ‘Umm....I’m…Nicky, Ben’s friend, who are you?’ I answered him reluctantly…   ‘Oh, I’m Jake, Ben’s friend as well’ he stated while laughing light-heartedly.   He seemed like a pretty decent guy…hmm…I wouldn’t mind getting to know him, as long as he wasn’t as pig-headed as Ben…*sigh*…he could turn out handy as well…   ‘Ohh…’ I expressed.   Jake stood at the door like an idiot fidgeting with his hands…I guess the tension was pretty thick…   ‘Ben’s not home right now…did you want to come in?’ I spoke, deciding to break the silence first…   ‘Oh…okay…umm nah I don’t want trouble you’ he answered politely…   ‘Oh…it’s no trouble at all!’ I protested in a sugary sweet tone…   ‘Umm…okay then, sure’ he replied smiling at me…   I lead him into the house and poured each of us a cup of coffee before settling down to talk…   Turned out that Jake was a pretty cool guy…he was funny, easy going and down to earth…nothing like Ben…sheesh…no idea how they became such good friends, they have nothing in common at all…besides the fact that they’re both quite cute…   Hmm…let’s see…   Jake is Intelligent; Ben is slow and dim-witted…  Jake is funny; Ben is naturally stupid and annoying…   Jake is polite; Ben is pig-headed and arrogant…  Jake is easy going and respects women; Ben is un-gentlemen like and disrespectful…  Jake is decent; Ben is just plain cheap!   *sigh*…the list just goes on!   By the time I was finished with talking to Jake I managed to gather some dirt on Ben…   1. Ben used to have a pot-head haircut [I’d like to see that one!]  2. He was dumped by a girl when he was 16 [He’ll never live it down…HauaHaha]  3. He has a little sister called Ice  4. He hates being called Consti-Ben [No idea why…what does the ‘Consti’ part mean? Hmm…]  5. His weakness is money and girls  6. Looks are everything to him  7. He hates the color pink.  8. He keeps a teddy bear in his room but is embarrassed about it because he says it’s not masculine.  9. Gets jealous easy if he sees a hot chick with a good-looking guy.  10. He loves to show off about everything and he is quite big-headed [Jake didn’t tell me that one…I figured it out for myself…]  11. He has an imaginary fan club… [Figured that one out myself too]   I wrote the info down on a piece of paper and stashed it in my room for further use…maybe I could add to it…hmm…I sneer formed on my face as I thought of how I could use everything I had discovered against Ben…I got busy and conjured up some notes to remind myself…My first memo was…   • Use everything against him…    CHAPTER 19   [Ben’s P.O.V.]   *27th August*  [95 Days to Go]   Yesterday I went to work as usual…when I came back Nicky was cooking dinner…My heart skipped a beat when we exchanged glances…   She smiled at me innocently…was she up to something? My mind raced with thoughts and suspicion...I didn’t want to experience her vile ways of getting back at me again…I imagined what it would be this time…hmm…   ‘Sit down Ben’ she had said flatly.   I reluctantly took a seat near the table and waited for the dishes to arrive…when we had finally settled in I stared at her face searching for a little hint of suspicion…nothing…   Slowly I picked my chopsticks up and reached for the beans…I drew my hand away as I neared them remembering last times incident [Didn’t want that happening again]. Changing my mind I went for the fish…hopefully there was no poison in there…*sigh*…   Beads of sweat dripped from my forehead as my hand shakily clamped a piece of fish in the chopsticks…nearing my mouth I took a quick glance at Nicky making sure nothing funny was going to happen…   She remained calm and ate busily in silence not even glancing my way…slowly the fish entered my mouth and I rolled it around with my tongue while my eyes were closed tightly shut in anticipation, waiting for the hurtful blow to come my way, surprisingly enough…it was fine!   My heart beat slowed down and I began to eat without hesitation…  Lying in bed in my baby blue PJ’s, I stared at the ceiling wondering why she hadn’t put rat poisoning in the food…then I glanced at my clock and remembered work…   It was always 9.30am till 4.30pm…all I did was sit in my office and answer a couple phone calls and sign a few papers…   I’ve been working at B Corporations for quite a while now, Rainer introduced me to his adopted father’s company…I’m the Chief Executive’s assistant, but I hardly do anything all day because Rainer’s adopted brother, Derek takes his job so seriously!...   That’s a good thing though, I tend to sleep around and watch TV in my office a lot…did I mention I had a TV in my office? Well if I didn’t, I do, and it’s great! It’s just like being at home except I don’t have to pay for the electricity bills and I get paid too!   Thanks to Derek and Rainer, I have the perfect job….*sigh*….life would be so perfect if Nicky wasn’t around and if the stupid bold patch and bruises on my face would go away…   Oh wells…no point dreaming…or I’ll be late for work again…glancing at my clock it was 8:24am…I jumped out of bed and set   Mr. Patchy [My Teddy Bear] to the side…   ‘Bye Patchy’ I cooed at him.   His animated face stared back at me…*sigh*…it was his way of saying goodbye…I nodded my head at him…we had an unspoken understanding…   As usual I performed my usual routine…after stuffing my face with a quick breakfast and throwing on my suit I headed to the bathroom for my usual one hour facial assessment…   Clean shave? Check.   Neat hair? Check…oh no, hold on…   I picked up a comb lying on the bathroom sink and gently combed my hair fondly and styled it with some gel…   After a few excruciating moments I inspected my fine work…tilting my head from side to side and slanting this way and that  I inspected every angle to make sure not a strand of hair was out of place…   Managing to have covered my bold patch with some hair, my eyes glistened with pride… Ben, you’ve solved another dilemma!   Back to my check list…   Clean shave? Check.   Neat hair? Yup, yup, yup!   Good Facial complexion?   I leaned in closely to see the faint bruises that were caused by Nicky’s vicious, brutal acts…hmm…they were getting less clear, but still visible to the naked eye…   I rummaged through the cupboard behind the mirror to find something to hide the bruises….I didn’t have time yesterday so everybody could see the embarrassing bruises…   Surprisingly, no one mentioned it! Not even Derek who had the biggest and boldest mouth ever along with Jake…but I haven’t seen Jake lately…   Picking up a small tub of lotion I peered at the inscription…   ‘Foundation-For women who know themselves’   What the heck does that mean? I pondered for a while…Foundation?   Since when did I own this…and it was for women too!   For a fact…I would like to state that I, Benjamin Uy am 100% man! And I will NEVER be known as a man who owns a woman’s facial cream!   I puffed out my chest in the mirror with my reflection gazing back at me…now THIS was the Ben I knew! My eyes stared fondly at the dead, sexy male staring at me…who else could it be but ME!  *sigh*…My fans have got excellent taste if they like me so much…no, not like, love…they worship me….   The same, old, familiar saying popped back up into my head…   I, Ben, am literally a chick magnet…   Feeling good about myself I decided that either way women would love me…but I still had to do something about the bruises…  *sigh*…   I stood in thought for a few moments wondering how to cover up the stupid bruises done my Nicky’s vicious felonies [As I liked to call them]   My eyes gazed around the room and fell on the Foundation …hmm…maybe I could….but….no I can’t do that! Its girls stuff! But still…   I debated against my conscious over and over again…saying it was wrong to apply women’s make up on…but it was alright in desperate measures…*sigh*…   The result was very confusing…I glanced at my watch and my eyes bulged out of my sockets… 9:20am…if I didn’t leave right now I’d be late for work….Derek wouldn’t be very happy either…he loves to give me lectures about coming on time and taking my work seriously…*sigh*…   I decided to take a chance and I pampered my face with the stuff…after a few coughs I gave a quick glance at the mirror to make sure nothing drastic had happened…surprisingly enough everything was fine…and better! The bruises weren’t there anymore!   Forming a bright smile on my face I grabbed my suitcase and raced out of my apartment, down the stairs and towards my car…    CHAPTER 20  [Ben’s P.O.V.]   *27th August*   [At the Office]   ‘Morning Mr. Uy’ the secretary, Miss Tolentino smiled brightly at me…   I gave her a wink, my usual greeting…   ‘Morning Sir’ another female colleague spoke as I sauntered past her looking cool and sexy.   I gave out another wink.   *sigh*…I had a feeling that today was going to be a good day…I had managed to cover up the embarrassing bruises and bold patch  I had from Nicky’s felonies…   As I reached my office, Miss Javier another of my colleagues gave me a flirtatious wink…   ‘Hi Mr. Uy…’ she cooed while deliberately moving her hips from side to side in an attempt to seduce me…   I stared at her in wonderment…she really knew how to work a guy…but not me…no, no, no…I don’t date colleagues…if I could I would…but Derek strictly forbid me to go near any of his workers…he said it could lead to complications..*sigh*…   I winked at Miss Javier like I did with the other girls before entering my office and closing the door…   Settling down my briefcase I slumped onto my lazy boy chair and stared out at my window view…I had one of the big offices in the building with a large scenery view of Makati City. Seeing as how Derek and I were good friends, I had some privileges…but not as many as him, since he is the boss’s son…*sigh*…   I still don’t understand why Derek wanted to work as a minor when he first began and then make his way to the top when he could start out as the C.E.O. at the start…   I questioned him once and he answered with the most pointless words…   ‘I don’t want to cheat my way in life…a good boss is one who knows his people and position…not one who knows money and power…’ he had informed me…   I still don’t get what he meant by that…and I don’t think I ever will…scratching my head in confusion I opened my desk drawer and pulled out the remote for the TV.   Aimlessly I flicked the channels with nothing in particular to watch…anxiously, I waited checked my watch constantly while beads of sweat dripped down my forehead…   I loosened my tie awaiting my desired moment…Breathing in and out loudly I closed my eyes and listened to the shuffling of paper work and the repetitive ringing of office phones waiting to be answered…   A grumbling noise was heard every so often…beads of sweat dripped from my forehead as I cringed in anxiety with my eyebrows curved in an arch…   *Beep Beep*   ‘Lunch Break, I repeat, Lunch Break’   *Beep Beep*   I let out a long sigh of relief as I heard the all too familiar words coming out of the office speakers I longed to hear throughout the day...yum! Lunch Break!!! My favorite time of the day when I was working!   The grumbling was becoming unbearable through the grueling hours stuck in a stuffy office and listening to the sounds of workers busily walking around the building while shouting across the room for signatures to be signed and meetings to be held…   Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind working here…it’s great! Derek is here and sometimes Rainer pops by to say hi…that’s why I like working here…the people are friendly and I have friends here too. Not to mention I don’t have to hold a lot of responsibility because Derek likes to do his job properly and without fault…he doesn’t like to laze around, he’s such a robot sometimes…*sigh*…   I guess he really takes the whole business thing serious seeing as how when his dad retires he is expected to carry on working here and maintain the company standard along with Rainer…but Rainer doesn’t really show up a lot…   I hastily walked to the cafeteria and picked up a food tray before lining up to be served…I love food…*sigh*…not to mention it’s free here!   I have to admit I’m a cheapo…but hey? Who WOULD want to part with money? Besides now that Nicky is going to live with me for…100…no…98?...no…96 days…yeah, that’s right…96 days…I need more money to support her…so I have to show up for work more…   I pondered for a while thinking about money and the problems that come with it…   Then I remembered Derek…he was probably inside his office being a workaholic as usual…he rarely comes out to eat…   Deciding to get him something to eat I told the worker behind me to save my spot and I sprinted to the back and got another tray for Derek…   When I got back it was my turn to be served…after giving a bow and saying a polite thank you I piled the two trays with food…   ‘Let me guess…for Derek?’ Mrs. Jang asked me with a jolly smile plastered on her face while her rosy cheeks shone in the cafeteria.   I nodded my head as an answer while smiling at her…   She was one of the many cooks at B corporations and she was great! Her food was so delicious and scrumptious!*sigh*…yummy!   ‘Have Fun Ben’ she called out to me.   I gave her a nod and a smile while I headed out of the cafeteria and towards Derek’s office…   Derek’s office was a door away from mine…Miss Javier was in-between us…   When I finally reached his office door I encountered another dilemma…how am I going to knock on the door? Both my hands are full by carrying both of the trays…   I winced in confusion trying to find another solution…I considered kicking the door open but that wouldn’t be very friendly…especially if Derek was talking to his dad…not to mention the BOSS of B corporations…*sigh*…   I had an urge to scratch my head like I always did when I was in thought…   After a few moments I came up with a few solutions…   1. Kick the door open.  2. Shout out to Derek to open the door.  3. Ram my way in  4. Knock on the door with my head   I pondered for a while wondering which one was best suitable for the situation…my tummy was beginning to grumble again and I was stressing over a little problem..*sigh*…   I settled upon knocking on the door with my head…   Here goes nothing…*sigh*…   *Knock, Knock, Knock*   ‘Who is it?’ Derek asked from the other side.   ‘It’s me…Ben’ I called out.   I heard the shuffle of papers and the sound of footsteps approaching the door…then the door clicked open…   Derek’s eyebrow jerked up at me with a questioning look…   ‘Here’s yours’ I told him while shoving a tray towards his chest…   After a few moments of Derek staring at his tray dumbfounded he took hold of the sides and said thanks before letting me in and walking back to his seat…   We sat in silence and ate out lunch…he seemed to be in deep thought, while I stared in space with nothing in particular in mind…I figured he was probably thinking of the merge of his company with other corporations or something…   Although Derek was older than Rainer and they weren’t related at all, besides the fact that they treated each other as brothers because Derek’s Dad had adopted Rainer…they had a shocking resemblance to each other…   When I first met them I couldn’t tell them apart at all…everything was exactly identical, there blonde streaked hair and facial features, their personalities and even the way they dressed…   But as the years progressed Rainer became more distant after an incident with his girlfriend Eugene…at least I THINK it was his girlfriend…he never gave us much details…just rambled on about the afterlife, reincarnation and stuff like that…   Derek didn’t change…his personality is still laid-back but serious when it comes to decisions about the future…but he still has time to joke around and stuff…   Rainer is always serious nowadays…you hardly see him crack a smile or a joke…   ‘How did you knock on the door if you were holding both of the trays in your hands?’ Derek asked me seemingly interested.   ‘Use my head of course’ I answered him while forming a grin on my face feeling proud of my solution…   So much for acting smart…Derek shot me another questioning look...*sigh*…   ‘Thought so….I knew you wouldn’t of thought of something simpler’ Derek shook his head and sighed loudly in defeat as if he could never figure me out…   I stared at him in confusion…   ‘What do you mean by that?’ I persisted curiously.   ‘Well…you could’ve just set the trays down on the table…instead of banging your head on my door’ Derek contradicted while taking a gulp of his Ramen noodles casually.   I gave him a dirty look and dropped the subject knowing Derek was right…   He laughed it off and shook his head at me…   ‘What’s that on your hair?’ Derek asked me in wonderment.   ‘It’s called G-E-L’ I retorted feeling smart that I had came up with a come back.   ‘I know that you idiot!’ Derek said defensively followed by a push on my forehead.   I groaned loudly while continuing to eat…   Derek gave out little sniffs…   *sniff, sniff* *sniff, sniff*   I glanced up to see what Derek was doing…he kept sniffing his hand…   ‘What are you doing?’ I asked him.   He ignored my question and touched the side of my cheek and ran his index finger across my jaw bone as if he was smudging off some dirt or something…   I gave him a weird look…   ‘What’s with you?’ I said while tilting my head along with  Derek’s movements.   Again, he sniffed his hand and rubbed his fingers together…   ‘Is…that, Foundation?’ Derek asked me, giving me his full attention…   My heart skipped a beat…how did HE know? My cheeks felt hot as my heart beat rapidly increased…how embarrassing…   I gave out a nervous chuckle trying to ease the tension…   ‘Don’t be stupid Derek…only GIRLS were foundation...I mean, COME ON would you ever catch ME…God’s gift to Women wearing Foundation?!’ I asked him while giving out a nervous snort.   Derek stared at me with a weird look…   I could feel my cheeks heating up while I looked around the room trying to avoid his gaze…after what seemed like forever Derek shrugged his shoulders and took another gulp full of noodles…   I let out a secret sigh of relief while I silently ate my noodles…   That was lucky!   I got home that day tired and exhausted even though I hadn’t really done anything all day…but hey? Nicky didn’t know that so she wouldn’t have to annoy me with being lazy now that she knew that I actually had a job.   She couldn’t say much either since she was a former bar-girl a couple days ago…   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TO BE CONTINUED~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
