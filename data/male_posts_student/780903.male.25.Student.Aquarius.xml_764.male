Check it out if you dare.  Tonight at a cappella rehearsal, we had to discuss Harvard's anti-hazing statute.  There's a law, it seems, that requires all student organizations here to sign an anti-hazing pledge.  Because hazing is obviously a big problem for a cappella groups.  And the Jewish Law Students Association (eat that pork!  you must eat that pork!).  And the technology law journal.  And moot court.  From the statute:   269:17. Hazing; organizing or participating; hazing defined  Whoever is a principal organizer or participant in the crime of hazing, as defined herein, shall be punished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars or by imprisonment in a house of correction for not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment.  The term 'hazing' as used in this section and in sections eighteen and nineteen, shall mean any conduct or method of initiation into any student organization, whether on public or private property, which willfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person. Such conduct shall include  whipping, beating, branding, forced calisthenics, exposure to the weather, forced consumption of any food, liquor, beverage, drug, or other substance, or any other brutal treatment or forced physical activity  which is likely to adversely affect the physical health, or safety of any such student or other person, or which subjects such student or other person to extreme mental stress, including extended deprivation of sleep or rest or extended isolation.   "Exposure to the weather" is awfully vague.  There's always some sort of weather.  Making someone enjoy a beautiful day: hazing.  Asking you to eat the "welcome to our church" cookies: hazing.  Making you hold the door for the person behind you ("forced physical activity"): hazing.  Better examples of stupid things that would count as hazing: coming later when I'm more creative.
