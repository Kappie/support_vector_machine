Fate is really starting to piss me off and I think I'm gonna give it the slip and control my own life from now on.  I was gonna respond to what you said Joshua, but I figured I don't need any enemies. I really didn't want you to take what I said the wrong way. Your right, we are different, I just ment that we have a few things in common: yaoi, love problems, and a blog were we express our problems. Sorry that I offended you and I promise I won't ever say another thing about you in my blog.  I got Saiyuki Vol. 3 in the mail today. I guess I should change my fanfic because it really doesn't fit that well with the story. It was a good vol. but it wasn't as good as the others in my opinion. It wasn't as funny as the rest, but I like the storyline better this time. Well, wish me luck tomorrow and just hope that I do the right thing, whatever that might be. TTYl
