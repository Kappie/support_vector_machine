Thank god i don't drive that way.  Reading an excellent new Rand book called "The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution"  About the "new" left of the 60's and 70's.  I love Rand's style and I love the fact that man is this just chock full of anthro answers, pragmatism answers, i knwo for a fact that i'm gonna be running so many objectivism k's next year it won't even be funny.  Trying to get a game to work and postpone sleep, but it's being a little bastard, which does suck, cause i kinda sorta was really waiting for this thing for quite a while.  Oh my god I love clone high, the fact that the best entertainment that MTV has ever put out was canceled because it was too high brow and was replaced by punk'd is also hilarious.  In a makes me want to poke my eyes out kind of way.....wesley  Gotta get up at 10:00 to go eat lunch with mom, dunno how that'll turn out, guess i'll find out shortly considering it's 1:00 in the morning right now.  Damn nocturnal behavior...like i'm some kind of evil wombat...or owl.  Actually, it's getting pretty late, better wrap this up, oh, my dad finally got the reaking forms in to whitman, so i'm definetly going there over the summer, Walla Walla here i come, baby.  Man that sounded nerdy.  -With all geekiness
