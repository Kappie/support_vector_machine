Let me do a good /bad analysis: It's Friday / good, I have a piano recital rehearsal / bad, Neil gave me this cool mod which I talked about before "The Specialists" / good, school ends in like 14 days / really good, got  yearbooks today / good, my social studies teacher, who I will not give away the name of until I'm out of 7th grade, is coming back from Washington D.C. on Monday / really bad (just thinking about that could ruin my weekend, and my fellow classmates and I have thoroughly enjoyed our hiatus from her). Oh, well. I don't want to go to this recital or rehearsal, because for some unknown reason, my recital song deteriorated while I kept practicing (kind of ironic, don't you think?). Fred is performing his play tonight, I think I'll go see it if my parents don't have anything planned. Oh, and before I forget,  urlLink here  is a link to  urlLink homestarrunner.com , because it's awesome.
