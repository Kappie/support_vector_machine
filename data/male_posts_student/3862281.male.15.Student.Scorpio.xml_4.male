For example, take Islam, one of their teachings say that cohabitation (a couple living together without being married) shouldn't happen. It's because of this that most muslim's marriages are arranged marriages (or atleast I think that's the case, I should listen more in RE) and therefore how on Earth do the people get to know eachother before becoming married? Also, in Islam,divorce is frowned upon (I think, I am fairly sure about most of these facts being true in some sense I just might not be 100% accurate) therefore as soon as a couple becomes married they're basically stuck together, or face the embarrasment of getting a divorce. I have heard that the parents  do  usually pick good partners but still, there's always a chance that they might get it wrong and therefore damn their child to live their life with someone they utterly dispise or atleast mildly dislike. How can you manage to get to know somebody enough to marry them purely through dates and without living together for atleast a short period before actual marriage?  I do however try to keep an open mind and therefore if anyone reading this does know if there's actually any sensible reasoning behind this then please tell me because I'd really quite like to know.
