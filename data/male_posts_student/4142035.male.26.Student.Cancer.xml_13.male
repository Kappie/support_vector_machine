Do they think I forgot to order part of a calling plan when I first signed up?  "Yeello."  "Hello, this is Jenny, from Qwest.  I just wanted to keep you posted on all our various exciting offers..."  "Oh, no, that's OK, I'm good."  "But wait!  We have an option here for just $80 a month that you'll want to check out!  Pay a flat fee of just an additional $80 per month and have free long distance, at any time, and from any of your phones!"  "I only have one phone."  "Well, you can use your cell phone, too."  "Cell phones are Satan's spawn and the harbinger of evil and doom to all who sign a calling plan contract."  "Uh..."  "On the other hand, sounds like a good idea.  I'll take it."  I want to know how many people actually buy more services from their phone company when their phone company calls them, even though they've already signed up for the services they want.  It must be a pretty big number, considering all the junk phone calls I get.  Here's a more accurate translation of the above conversation...  "Yeello."  "Hi, this is Annoying, Phony, Wanna-Be Perky Pants Even Though I Hate My Job And I Hate You, from Quest.  I want to sell you more stuff despite the fact that you don't need it.  Also, we have some, quote-unquote, deals we'd like to offer you where we say that you save money by buying a particular service that actually costs more than what you're paying now and pawnning it off as a  urlLink bargain  because it costs less than the other services we advertise purposely at a higher cost in order to manipulate you into buying the one we've presented as being some sort of savings opportunity."  "Fuck off."  "Fuck you, too, sir.  And thank you for using Qwest."  The least people could do is be honest.
