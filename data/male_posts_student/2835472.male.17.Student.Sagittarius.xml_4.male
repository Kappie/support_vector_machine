I never thought I'd do that but hey, what the heck, they're truly good people in the long run and I'm feeling generous with my positive compliments.  In addition, props to crew for keeping me busy. Heh.  Life is pretty good.  Uh oh, slipping into one of those blogs... Yeck, my blog is better, well as of now.  Although I have been sorta busy over the break with crew and all so I haven't had much of a chance to post...  Yet somehow when I have school I always seem to find some time.  Odd.  I'm really appreciating this break.  It's awesome.  All it needs is a huge LAN party of some sort! w00t! I'm still realizing I'm off from school and how awesome that is...  Although I sure have noticed that I'm much more full of energy at 10am instead of darned 7am in the morning.  The sun being fully over the horizon in the morning is a very good thing.  No more cold.  Anyways,  I have to shout at Christina:  Good luck on the quest for erm... you know ;) May!?!? Geez! Well.  I = Never. w00t. :)
