I love you."  These lines depict love in such a vivid manner, anyone who is in love before will read these and stares into space, recalls the feeling one possesses. Love is so beautiful this way. No matter what happens, separated or together, if the love is still felt, it remains beautiful.   I start to wonder, when will I love like that again. Will I be able to ? I dont know. The feeling of love for someone is one that you keep safely inside your heart like a precious treasure. Smile.. smile smile.. love is beautiful. it is to draw a smile instead of frown. :)
