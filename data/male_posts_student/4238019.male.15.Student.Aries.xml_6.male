That was a heart breaking incident for all Manchester United Fans, and for me, I was upset too. In school, during PE, the boys played soccer on the hockey pitch, and I was enjoying myself! :D After that, I drank lots of water to hydrate myself. I went to refill my water bottle and drank the water from the bottle filled with water from the water cooler. After drinking, and a few hours later, I felt very uncomfortable. I felt my stomach weighting a few tonnes that I think I felt sick. Maybe I slept too late last nite, and I have got headache too. So later I am going to see the doctor at around 6.30pm. Pray for me to get well too, if you're hardworking :D~. Dear Lord, pls heal me in the powerful name of Jesus that I will have speedy recovery, Thank You Lord for all this I pray in Jesus name, Amen. :). Today is Xiu Juan's b'dae, aka Xi Gua. I hope the Presence CD gift would touch her heart and make the right decision. :). Ok, I think I'll end off here and I wish everyone the best for their studies. Goodbye!
