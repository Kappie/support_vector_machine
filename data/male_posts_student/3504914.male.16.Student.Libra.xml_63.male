Song of the Moment : Phill Collins- Both Sides of the Story   Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some strangers down sleeping with an empty bottle, he's sad and an empty hearted man all he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can  We always need to hear both sides of the story  A neighbourhood peace is shattered it's the middle of the night young faces hide in the shadows, while they watch their mother and father fight he says she's been unfaithful, she says her love for him has gone and the brother shrugs to his sister, and says "looks like it's just us from now on"  We always need to hear both sides of the story  And the lights are all on, the world is watching now people looking for truth, we must not fail them now be sure, before we close our eyes don't walk away from here 'til you hear both sides  Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the centre of the storm neighbours once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn they've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets while small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat  We always need to hear both sides of the story  And the lights are all on, the world is watching now people looking for truth, we must not fail them now be sure, before we close our eyes don't walk away from here 'til you hear both sides   White man turns the corner, find himself within a different world ghetto kid grabs his shoulder, throws him up against the wall he says "would you respect me if I didn't have this gun 'cos without it, I don't get it, and that's why I carry one"   We always need to hear both sides of the story _______  I love the bolded part, dunno why   Rambles : Well, first day of school. While Mur is complaining about not being in school and everybody thinking she is, i'm complaining that I actually am in school. It's not that it was bad, it was just hard getting used to listening to JENNY rambling on xD Kidding, if you're reading. Otherwise the day went fine, computer class was interesting because I found some really stupid pick-up lines and we (we being the guys, no doubt) got a kick out of it.   Thanks Fudge for the love dice, but as i've told you, I gave those two bringers of sexual pleasure to Christina, for no doubt she will find more practice with them. She almost verbally orgasmed when she got "lick neck" if I remember correctly xD  Hmmm, the new P.E teacher isn't just going to let us lie, damn. He's actually looking forward to P.E class, whereas I guess our old teacher dreaded it, since we were all so lazy xD   I don't really have much to say, apart from the fact that on saturday i'm going to shave my hair off xD I HAVE HAD ENOUGH WITH THE HARRY POTTER CRACKS. I go into Brew and Co, the barista tells me I look like Harry Potter. I go looking for games, the person selling the games tells me I look like Harry Potter. At least if I trim my hair off, and then grow a goatee (which will be a pain), i'll look like Jean Reno, and though he's French, he's better than that twit of a child who plays Potter xD   Anyways, its Potter who looks like me, not the other way around.   Ai, later on
