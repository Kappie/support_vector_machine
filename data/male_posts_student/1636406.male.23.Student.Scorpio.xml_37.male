I've never been much of a drinker (except for perhaps last year), and after the killer hangover I had on cheap vodka this weekend- I don't think I will ever drink again.  I really do appreciate fine drinks, and I just think it's unfortunate that they have to be laced with liquid poison. I guess that is part of the excitement of any drink... When you combine fine ingredients to make a tasty yet deadly drink it makes you feel good inside.  It's why people make shots with tequila and tabasco sauce, it's why people spend $300 for a bottle of wine. Sadly I will take a risk and live without CH3CH2OH floating through my brain.  Again, it may not be the perfect solution, but I believe it is a step in the right direction.  Perhaps if you're a casual drinker you might take a similar stance.
