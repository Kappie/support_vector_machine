Ya, guys!! We had bible study then, when we read the bible for 30 minutes. Mr Kang, later told us some stories! Haha. Those types that start with; long long time ago...*yawn*. Haha, i m joking. When for lunch with Jeremy and we were making quite a lot of noise in Delifrance; making prank calls on people. Fortunately, we were not chased out. HAha... and chris msg me when i was walking back home, and asked me whether I want to go out. Crap! Fish! Stingray!     Wat else??
