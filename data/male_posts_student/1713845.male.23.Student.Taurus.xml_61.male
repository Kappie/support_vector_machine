And just because I've written enormous amounts of letters to you... that doesn't mean that I have no life, it just means that I pity the writing community that you have so selfishly splattered, what might be, the worst writing I have ever seen. Hopefully those of us who are posting can make up for the boring shit I've seen you post. Like updating your fucking weekend... "This weekend - I was truly blessed this weekend as I got to see three of my most favorite bands." ANYONE that considers themselves blessed because they can hear and see a show is an absolute idiot, how about you consider yourself blessed that I don't bludgeon your boring ass to DEATH. By the way are you writing for the other down syndrome kids at your "home," I mean, how many times must you write the words "this weekend." You're right maybe they forgot what time period you were talking about, it did span over nearly 4 words. I did however start laughing, no Sooze! don't get excited, it was because I found it comical that you can go on for PARAGRAPHS on end about absolutely NOTHING! rock-hillbilly... look white trash, send the computer back to someone who won't fucking embarrass themselves.    Plus you're old.   and way too ugly for posting several pictures on websites like friendster... which now should be called terrifyingpictures-sitester... quite frankly you were asking for trouble Mr. Toad.    You are my hero, Gia  P.S. as a fashion note... red lipstick only brings more attention to your horrific mouth and razor sharp animal killing teeth, just say no!
