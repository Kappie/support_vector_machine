I have turned my back on my brothers and have fallen into the  White .    Yes.I have bought a Mac product.    An iPod actually. 20Gigs, 4th generation. All white plastic and shiny chrome.  It's simple to use, does what it's made for well, turn on;plug in; forget it's there.    It's good. Not perfect. But good.    Yet I don't see what all the hype is about. Haven't made a Mac convert out of me. Heck it doesn't change my views on computing towards the Mac mindset either. Frankly I was more "enlighten" when I bought my first Palm PDA.    That being said, have to give credit due to Apple for a nicely made piece of tech.  If this is the device that makes people more aware of the joys of digital music, so be it. We could do alot worse.    Well I did say that I would talk about my issues with Apple if I did end up buying an iPod. Not everyone wants to hear it I know, but at least it will allow me to actually put down on paper my views. I'll try to do it soon.
