I know I have. it is hard to comprehend the complexity of ourselves let alone exsistence. So what are we to do? be lazy, only strole through life just barely making it from day to day. wondering when it's going to end. NO!!. We were ment to live for so much more. sometimes we just lose ourselves. sometimes the hardest thing to do is live. but when you do what you can, the best way you can, when you can there might still be hope for us.!!
