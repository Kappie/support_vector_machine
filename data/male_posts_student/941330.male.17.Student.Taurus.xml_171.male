(haha, it's fun to publicly  urlLink degrade clay aiken  just cuz he doesn't like one species out of a couple zillion! because animals are just like people! o man, stop the laughter!) we've probably got 70% of the delegation in the mock convention repping for liberals, and maybe half of the remainder are pretending to be conservative/moderate for balancing's sake. it's just too bad nobody thinks for themselves anymore.  what else...this man is very  urlLink smart . found him off blogger's blogs of note...if you know what he's talking about, you'll get a kick out of it. that reminds me, the bullcrap about cbs being "cowardly" about not filming the ronald reagan travesty of a biopic...(1) the man suffers from alzheimer's. something like this should not be filmed unless he can defend himself. (2) fabricated stories about artificially-created "heroes" (read: jessica lynch and the  urlLink crap the military spread  about her glorious rescue) are one thing, but doing them about men of reagan's stature is just disgraceful and repugnant. despite what people may think about his policies and actions, he was a great president that united the nation during the scares of the cold war.  it's gonna be on showtime now, whoop-dee-fucking-doo. hey, i'm not watching it.
