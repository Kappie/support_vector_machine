I like having the CD.  It also supports the artists.  I think Incubus is great, so I want them to keep making music.  No better way to support them then buying their album.  So that's just what I did.  I like a lot of songs on the CD.  One of my favorites is "Aqueous Transmission."  It's a slow song, real good though.  Something you can easily fall asleep listening to, if you have the bass down on your headphones/speakers.  I was thinking about getting the tool album, Ænima, but I didn't like the thought of having a 'parental' CD.  I think that I've given up on the idea to make my page and blog the same layout.  I don't really feel like messing with it enough to try to get it to work.  What I really wanted to do was get the archive address so I could put it on my archive page, on my site, but I can't.  It uses a tag for the archive address.  Thatway they can rename the address on the fly, and keep it working.  I don't have to worry because I'm not going to mess with it anymore.  I just don't feel like it.  Not really worth the effort, I think.  I do though, want to continue to update my site.  I plan on adding a research section.  I'll put, obviously research stuff.  Bed time.
