I quickly thought that it was impossible that this kid had thought of this all by himself and while I was buying khakis yesterday (for job interviews!) I was in the gap and saw upturned collars. Talk about having mind control over fucking yuppie kids-The thought process or how I imagine it musthave been something like this:  Kid walks into shop after blairing DMB from Jeep 4x4 in mechanical daze. After seeing polo shirt with up turned collar, "Whoa that's fucking amazing. I bet I can really set a trend by turning up my collar. What a great idea, I need to buy that shirt."  Stupidist thing I've ever seen.  If I see people doing it, I just yell "EEEEEEEEAAAAAGHHH" with double barreled thumbs up cause they don't know who the Fonz is.   PS Can some explain why the movie "Pollock" was so critically heralded? I knew a bit about the man before viewing the movie, but after 2 hours I feel like nothing much happened.
