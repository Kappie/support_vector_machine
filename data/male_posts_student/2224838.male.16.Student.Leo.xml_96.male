The special speaker at the luncheon was Cheryl Brown-Henderson, the daughter of Oliver L. Brown, a plaintiff in  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka . She spoke about the myths of the case, its effects on the country, and the continuation of desegregating our school system. Her address raised a good question: Are schools in this country still segregated today? Not necessarily in a literal sense, but in the way students continue to live within their own racial groups.   After the luncheon, students broke-up into discussion groups and participated in a student symposium. Some questions asked within the groups were:   How is segregation within your school?  How would your education be different without  Brown v. Board ?  Can separate ever be equal?  How are changing demographics in our community affecting your school?  What can you do to help desegregate schools?  I don't think any law can be implemented that can change the way people mix socially. It's all up to the person to decide if he wants to make friends with someone of another race. For some inexplicable reason, people just seem to flock to others of their own race, as if they can identify with them as they could not with someone of another race. It's probably more important to educate people on multicultural education than it is to force diversity in schools through some kind of quota policy (which I discovered that USD 259 uses).   Such diversity policies are even moving into universities through affirmative action. I still don't understand how affirmative action is making anything more equal. Why can't schools simply look at each individual in the same light, and judge them purely on whatever qualifications they would under normal circumstances?  Answer me these questions three, or however many I asked in this post.
