Finally got my schedule flattened out - it's a little more User Friendly(tm) now, but it's still a heavy load.  My history class was *full*. Seriously full. Glad I got there early. Got to stare at the bitches who didn't have syllabi or seats. Suckahs. We did the usual - examine the 'bus, yak about academic offences (personally I'm academically offended that, after four years, they're still going on about this) and then we got to the meat *shudder* and potatoes of today's class.   Firstly - Night Mail. A film made in 1936 by Harry Watt and Basil Wright - overseen by John Grierson. Mr. Grierson, I just learned, was a British ex-pat who lived in Canada for a period of time and founded the Documentary society in our great nation. An interesting film, one of the first documentaries ever made (Grierson also coined the term documenatry). The film, commissioned by the General Post Office, depicts the happy little society of men who get the mail there on time. A series of trains make their way through the night to a hub at Crewe, where their mail is sorted and exchanged, then they head out - all in a day's work. There is a fascinating sequence describing the snap locks and nets by which the mail bags are picked up and deposited. Even for 1936 grainy film stock, there were still a few exhilarating moments as the train raced along slinging it's cargo from it's belly and snapping up mail from swinging hooks. I always wondered if those Road Runner cartoons were accurate. There were some interesting elements about the film. All the men sorting the mail - proletarian little worker bees, seemed incredibly happy - there's a lot to be said for British cheer and tenacity - but these good old sports seemed to be having a gay old time doing what I can only imagine could be one of the most tedious jobs ever. It also seems the more "responsibility" you have, the less you have to do, the less hard you have to work and the less happy you are. It seems interesting that an element of the bourgeious imperial infrastructure would chose to depict the working relationships of their employees in such a manner. Then again, they are British, this might be the way it was. All in all, very history channel/TVO. I enjoyed it. Everyone else did not.  The second film was an offering from Bunuel and Dali - a pair of Spanish exiles in France in 1929. Silent, without commentary, the film used a series of imagery to convey a variety of sentiments - Anti-Catholic blasphemy, sex, death and rebirth. One interesting point - the death's head moth from the silence of the lambs makes an appearance. Now that I've done a bit more research into it, it's starting to make more sense.  The film opens with a women's eye being slit open. That garnered the expected reaction from a good portion of the student body - "eeeuuugh". What follows is 17 minutes of interconnected imagery that is as seperate from rational thought as the film makers could achieve. There is some sense about it though - apprarently there is a french phrase "ants in the palms" which translates into an itching to kill - as an image though - the pierced palm with insects crawling out - it's quite sacreligious. At one point the man chases the woman around, while dragging a piano with a horse or some dead game on it and some live priests are also dragged by the neck (dressed like Spanish Padres). The man shoots himself - or at least his doppelganger. Another man pokes at a dead hand in the street while a crowd gathers like the ants on the other man's palm. He's then hit by a car. From what I've read on IMDB, Dali and Bunuel decided to reject any rational progression while writing the script. I suppose that would be an interesting exercise - find a story that makes sense and film the exact opposite. I'm not sure I enjoyed it - perhaps I'm not thinking on a deep enough level - or it could be that my sense of taste simply doesn run down that alley. Needless to say I don't believe I will be adding the DVD version of Un Chien Andalo to my collection. Also according to IMDB - Dali appears as one of the priests being dragged with the piano. I wonder; what sort of Freudian fallout there is from that? I just read a comment on the message boards that reads "Don't think so hard, it'll only hurt your head" - he's probably right.
