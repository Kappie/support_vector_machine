I no longer have to use my homepage to report news about myself. It's great...saves space...yeah.  It's Sunday, and nothing much happened today, so theres not much to talk about. So, bye for now.  Keep checking in for more posts as the week progresses. Stay cool!  ---Ben Mood: Happy Listening to: R.E.M. - Automatic For The People Thought: "Ummm....clams?"
