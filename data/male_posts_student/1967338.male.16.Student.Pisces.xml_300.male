I need a couple more weeks to get everything in order.  Meanwhile I've invited Paul and Tyler, and the invitation is still open to anyone else.  Especially Thomas.  Thomas, you in? Oh, By the way Thomas, you haven't posted because because time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so, and time has been moving very quickly for you, so what seemed like days to us was only about half an hour to you, which you spent eating lunch. That's my guess, anyway.  As for the Web comic talk, get in the game!  I have 11 that I check regularly.  I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.
