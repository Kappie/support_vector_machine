The guy who calls my mom is here at this moment. It’s all. All right I like him for her. I wish they wouldn’t be so shh shh about it. But what can I do? Anyway the guy doesn’t look me in the eye. He thinks I don’t like him, which I didn’t but he’s All right now. I feel so excited for my mom. Maybe there are just friends but I’m not sure what they are. I still think it’s all exciting. I like the idea of being a group of three. Anyway I ordered lasagna. I’ll be all right for now.
