Then later we worked in the special needs class. The teacher there had a magazine. Inside the magazine were two needles hidden. If you found both of them and sent it in, you could win a prize. The teacher really wanted that prize, so we both helped her look for it. It was quite interesting, considering that Dominique kept on saying she found it.   Miss you sweetie.   Yea, that was pretty much my day. I know, interesting life. Like I said before, you must be bored if you are reading this, because my life isn't really that interesting. Well, thats all for today. This is Colin, signing off.
