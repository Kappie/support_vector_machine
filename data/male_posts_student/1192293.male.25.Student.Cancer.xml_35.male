Firefighters, who emerged as heroes of the rescue effort, also feature in the adverts." "Tom Roger, whose daughter was a flight attendant on American Airlines Flight 11, said: "I would be less offended if he showed a picture of himself in front of the Statue of Liberty. But to show the horror of 9/11 in the background, that's just some advertising agency's attempt to grab people by the throat," he told the New York Daily News."  This is what we get from a man who voluntarily uses the title "Wartime President" for himself.  Needless to say, using images of a tragedy to promote one's own political career is beneath contempt, and we were all pretty sure this was coming, but shit.  I still had hopes that some sort of human decency would prevail.  Now I know better.  This is gonna be one fucking ugly election.   urlLink Full Story
