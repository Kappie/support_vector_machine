I'm on the presidential team.  Let me tell you: It's BULLSHIT.  I want to SEE the players on that team's batting average come even close to my batting average for the season.  I will shoot myself if they even compare.  Because I know they won't.  I'm bored.  I have a team party Saturday, but I'm not going.  I'm spending the night at Mike's house.  In the morning, we're going to pick Hillary up and go to his lake.  Then, I'm going to go wrestle Steven (Mike's brother) and throw him off the raft like last time.  That was tight.  For the past five days, I've had to sleep in a hotel/my basement/the computer room.  I'm looking forward to sleeping in my own bed again tonight.  Korn kicks ass.  At least this song does.  And Dashboard DEFINATELY kicks ass.  I have to go to Matt's baseball game tonight and keep the book.  I really do not want to.  I would if it was at St. Joe but it's all the way up in Auburn so I really don't want to go.  I'll see if I can get out of it...  That's all I got...
