Today, I'm going to post about the 2003 Yearbook Camp, and also the final preparations for the camp that begins tomorrow. That's right. Tomorrow. Meaning, I have to pack stuff. Today. Or else I won't be ready...tomorrow. Which means that I won't have anything to do until Friday. And that's a week away. So, anywho. I told you it was coffee-fueled. Now, onto the fun stuff and things. I think there's like 6 or 7 stories to wrap up the past two years... last year's camp was full of interesting stuff. So, here we go.  2003 Class: Desktop 2 Last year's class was actually remotely interesting, since it involved things that I am aware of. Computers. The teacher(s) weren't annoying. They were actually pretty cool, and they came from the Walsworth Company themselves. We learned a lot of interesting Photoshop tricks, and a couple things in Pagemaker (which is my favorite program, btw). They gave me this huge as crap packet of stuff, which is what I've been using for my Photoshop tricks on Digital Lust. Anywho. It was a much better, much more interesting class than the Yearbook I class that I had taken before, and I liked it. Adam was in there with me, and we sat through on Dickert's laptop listening to his Hanson music and other weird things. Highly interesting. Great class, that one was.  Katie, Colleen, and the sperm covered sheets: Anyone up for a sick story? I've got one. The first night we were there, at 2:00 in the morning, I think it was, Katie, who was our editor last year, and one of her roommates, Colleen, came running out of their bedroom, and demanded that they get new sheets. The reason? They found someone's sperm in it. And that's just sick. Had they come knocking on our door screaming like that, I probably would have grabbed a fire extinguisher or something...because with my sense of reality, jumping under beds when someone knocks on the door, anything could happen. Trust me. But, me and Adam were already long gone asleep before that happened. So, I didn't hear about it until the next morning. Apparently, they had called room service several million times, and they wouldn't do anything about it, so they just flew out, went downstairs, and demanded that they get new sheets. Wow. Sick. But, hilarious.  Knock Knock. HIDE!: This has to be the stupidest moment of my life. But, it was also hilarious. It was around 12:30 in the morning, and Amber and Melissa H. were in our room talking to me, Adam, and Dickert. Someone came knocking on our door, and we all thought it was Mrs. Yearbook Advisor. So, Amber and Melissa went hiding into the closet, and I dove under the bed. Then, they all kind of looked at me for a second, and then Adam went to get the door...it was Courtney. So, after everyone stared at me for a second, I couldn't help but laugh... I hid under the bed in my own room because there were people in it. "No, Mrs. Yearbook Advisor, David didn't invite them in here...he's not even in here!" I felt pretty stupid, but, I guess I should have!  Amber Calls a Theme park attraction a bitch...: This one was already posted, but, hey, what the hell, I'll post it again! We were at Islands of Adventure, for our 5 or 6 hour break, and we were on the Dudley Do Right's Ripsaw Falls ride. Amber, who had just gotten off the Bilge Rat Barges thingy with the rest of us, was soaking wet, and couldn't take anymore water. So, when we were on the ride, we came down one of the smaller ramp thingys, and we got a little wet...and there was what looked like a platform where employees would sit and monitor...but nobody was there. Amber actually got up and started thinking about getting off the ride. Wow. So, between her and Katie screaming, calling the ride a bitch, Adam screaming like a little girl in the car behind us, and me trying to splash water back up at Amber, I think it was pretty interesting. Just wait until someone doesn't want to get wet this year....HAHAHA.  Mrs. Yearbook Advisor Behind the Wheel: Now, you may remember yesterday's story of Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's Mom and her driving abilities, but, things couldn't get any funnier than what happened at camp last year. She was pulling out at the intersection of 490 and 200 on the way to camp, and she pulled out right in front of a car, so she swerved into the left lane, and STOPPED THE CAR, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC. She got out of the car, and said that the suitcases were packed too high. So, me, from Mrs. Adam's Mom's van, am thinking, what the hell is she trying to do... She finally realized there was traffic coming, so she swerved off to the grass. Then, in Orlando, she was coming into Universal the day we went to IOA, and she pulled out in front of a shuttle, just like I thought she would. Then, on I-4 just outside of Universal, she was getting off to get back to the hotel, and she cut off a car. Definite good times...   Courtney and the Dishes: I had already posted this one, too, but, since I'm talking about 2003 camp, I figured I'd bring it back up. They were having an ice cream social on the first night, and I got up to put my dish on the overstacked pile of dishes, and I was thinking "I'm gonna break something, I know it." Well, I had put it down and walked away, and all of a sudden, CRASH! I'm thinking "Oh shit." But, then I see Courtney and Elizabeth standing there, laughing, because they had dropped the dishes. Cameras and photographers from the Photography class everywhere. Courtney blushing. People laughing. People choking on ice cream. Alright, maybe it wasn't that dramatic, but, it was highly hilarious. Which is why I posted it.  Hard Rock Cafe: Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's "50th Birthday" You got your three new stories. So stop complaining! This one came from the last day of camp, before we were heading home. We went to Hard Rock Cafe for lunch, and Dickert played a little joke on Mrs. Yearbook Advisor, and the Hard Rock Cafe itself, too. He told the waiter and waitress that it was Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's 50th birthday, and that they should call her up and do something mean. So, later on, they went over to her and were like "Ma'am, could you please come with us?" So, she went, and we all followed. He was like "Attention Hard Rock! Today is Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's 50th birthday, so lets sing it." So they sang. And I thought Mrs. Yearbook Advisor was going to kill Dickert for that one.   So, that's it then. Two years down, and one more to go. Yearbook camp begins tomorrow, and I'm out of here at 6:45 tomorrow morning. So I'm going to get up, post my Farewell post, and then get out of here, so I can do some work up in the school until its time to leave. Which means, I have to carry all of my luggage with me there. I'll be back later tonight with "Not So Late But Late Enough Because I'm Leaving for Yearbook Camp Early Tomorrow Morning Bloggin" post, and maybe some other stuff, too. So, see ya!
