My friend told me that have a house to house ice-cream selling job that is $10 per hour and thats very good pay, But end up, it's only $3 and if you sell a total of $140 and they will gv u 10% com and thats crap as you need to talk alot and phyco all the auntie to buy the stupid walls ice-cream from, i went there to have a look at other people selling that and whole block he only earn $20 -_-" and I wonder how they going to get the $130 min target? it's really a crappy job.. I think may be tml I will go to Genki sushi to interview for cook and let's just pray that they need cook if not I really have to look for other job = ( So confused today and I don't know what i am confused about! that's a big problem! Guess I miss her too much = ( been along time since I last saw her~! Everytime I see her, I feel lik hugging her and tell her that I want to be by her side not as a friend but as her boyfriend however, everytime when I plan to tell her that, she's not free to go out with me.. But... should I give up on her? this is what I am thinking about everytime! Haiz.. I don't know what to do! Can anyone teach me what to do?! ="(
