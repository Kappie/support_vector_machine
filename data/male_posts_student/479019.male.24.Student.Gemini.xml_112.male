I called them up and apparently they fucked up my social security number and haven't processed my transcripts yet. If I don't get into their school, I'm going to be pissed!  Man... that statistics midterm was almost too easy. I was done with the exam in about 15 minutes. I was sitting around checking to see if anyone turned in their exam yet... I think I was the first one done. I don't like turning in my exam first, because I feel weird... especially since I was done that quick... let's hope it really was easy! When exams are too easy I get nervous... oh yea.. this is my last midterm exam ever! Woohoo!  In rotation right now is  Screeching Weasel 's  My Brain Hurts  (1991).  ***
