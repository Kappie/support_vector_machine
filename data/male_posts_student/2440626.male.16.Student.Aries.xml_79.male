We had yet another  Summerfest  last night at my house.  Everyone was in attendence.  Then, at 9:45, we moved the party down to Jer's house.  Basically,  I only have a few more weeks of boredom cause then the excitement starts.  Youth stuff, SB2W, VBS, school shopping, then finally, Junior year starts.  Wow.
