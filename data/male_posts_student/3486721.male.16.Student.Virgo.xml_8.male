My friends have stopped smoking and they have stayed off the drugs and are starting to become more friendly than they were last year: when i would call them " fuck heads " and they would start swearing back. I mean  what is wrong with being a fuck head?!   (many reasons why, I just can't be arsed to state them all.      All of us + Niklas's dad who just decided to jump in and join us in the jacuzzi to start argueuing about gay rights. Weird Subject. Our final conclusion:  We have nothing against them !  While you are in your own places enjoying the sun, I'll still be in Sweden catching up on old times with mates and teaching them to play football; since none of them can!
