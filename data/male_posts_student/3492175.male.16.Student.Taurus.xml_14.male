TODAY i get to leave westvirginialand and go to pittsburg and see a baseball game. woo, thats a good time, i love it when my dads work gives him free stuff. heh, when i woke up today i couldnt remember what state pittsburg was in. so i determined that it was in denver, and that denver was indeed a state.  well, since ive only been up 5 minutes ill let the dayh happen before i write about it. heh.
