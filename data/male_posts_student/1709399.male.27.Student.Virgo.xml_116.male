I feel as if I have written this article because it exactly conveys my feelings. Having been (  still) a big Curd Rice fan , I identify myself with this article.                                                         In fact my mom tells me a story when I was 10 years old , they had taken me to a party in Taj and I had insisted on having only Curd Rice even there !! Curd Rice still is my favourite dish and will remain so forever .
