I'm not particularly upset anymore, because my issues can be fixed. I can only post a little bit, namely, what you're reading now, for the time being, any of those who even read this blog anymore, because I'm still on the busy side. When I post next, hopefully tomorrow, I'll try and make it nice and interesting for people to start reading again, heheh.
