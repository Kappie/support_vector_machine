I did not celebrate her birthday with John Kerry in Cedar Rapids; I went to a wholesome gathering of friends and blew up some Chinese made fireworks like all other good patriots.  As much as I am tempted, I will not bring politics into this post.  But let it be said that I don't hate America, I love America.  I think we can all agree that fireworks are damn cool.  What isn't cool is when you are dog sitting the most timid dog in the world on Fourth of July weekend.  People are lighting off noisy explosives at 2PM, 2AM, and every time in between.  This dog has not relieved itself in days.  I will set her down in the middle of my yard where she will stand for a moment at high alert.  At the first sound of a firecracker she bolts to the backdoor.  So I try keeping her in the yard via leash.  Still nothing.  I challenge the scientific community to develop doggie ear plugs effective against all booms!  I also challenge the scientific community to make better booms.  Bigger, louder, brighter booms!  Nuclear booms!  Booms that could destroy orbiting satellites!  So back to this dog.  She is small and does not require much exercise.  Regardless of this, I still decided to take her on a walk.  I came to the conclusion that she has not been on many walks before.  She couldn't quite grasp the concept of a sidewalk or straight path, or even follow my lead!  She insisted on turning onto any path to the right.  She turned right (direction) into driveways, steps, and roads, all while I indicated no sign of turning.  Now sure, my pooches are walk veterans, but this really was ridiculous.  A few times she decided to run into oncoming traffic.  Now Otto will chase after cars, but he believes he could win the fight.  I don't think this little, firecracker fearing lap dog thinks she can beat a car in a battle.  Then again, who knows?  Dogs are crazy.  They'll bite your head if you're wearing steak on it.
