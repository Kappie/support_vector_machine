I, personally, believe in the bible's teaching about homosexuality, that it is morally wrong to "lay with a man as you would a woman". And so, I do pray for gays and lesbians everywhere, that they would one day see the true way and that God will guide them in the proper direction.   However, as a "free country", we must allow things such as gay marriage. Many have suffered and died for our religious and personal freedoms. If you look at the majority of third world countries, they have a forced religion, they have very limited freedoms. Yes, it is great to live in a country where we are allowed to practice Christianity, but we must keep it out of our political system, because that is not what this country is. I think it would be fantastic if every single person in the world lived by the words in the Bible and the teachings of Christ, however, while we must remain vocal about our faith, we can not ram it down others throats against their will. You expect satanists and bhuddists and african tribes people to keep their religion out of their dealings with politics, so why is it so much to ask as politician to leave his Christianity at the door?    Christians can be tyrants, too
