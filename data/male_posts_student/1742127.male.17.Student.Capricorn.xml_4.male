We're making a web-page in BCIS... so that's pretty kool. The only class that remains the same is Mrs. Bozeman's Alebra class. I love you Mrs. Bozeman! lol...       We got our clothes in for cheerleading camp today. Mrs. Smith kinda messed up and ordered two of the same shirts with different colors..... uh.. yeah.. lol ANYWAYS......      I don't know what to change my MSN name to?? LoL I want it to have something to do with My Mikey... but I dunnno!?!?!  G2G! Later!  ~ChRiStIn
