Bad idea. Shoulda stayed up late. It feels later than it is, and I'm not really tired. Yesterday I asked Becky out, and she said yes. I'm so happy, but I'm not gonna put on some gayfer show of emotion because I'm happy. I love her, and I'm glad she's my gf. Secondly, for those of you who are wondering "Havoc, yesterday was Bungie day. Where's the cool posts or cool story or cool thing you have to show us?" My answer is, I was just to busy having a life. Sorry. For those who are wondering, yes, I did happen to play Halo once yesterday. Just to get into the holiday spirit. Well, I think I'm gonna update some other stuff, then eat something and go to bed. As soon as I logged on to blogger, my inspiration to write left my mind.
