The most important, fundamental rule that is critical to achieving eventual financial independence is to "Pay Yourself First". While the majority spend most of their paycheck and hope to have some left over, the successful minority save first, then spend. The ideal amount to save before spending is 10%. Depending on one's circumstance, this amount may be higher or lower, as long as any amount is saved before spent.
