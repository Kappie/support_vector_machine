He got up at 11:30 today cuz he really knew he wasn't going to have anything to do during the day without his car.  But he still decided to get up before noon.  He then took a shower, listened to music and watched tv while snacking on some Cheetos Puffs.  Tyke watched Master and Commander later on in the day when he got pretty bored.  It was a pretty good movie but the middle of it was a little boring.  Then as time kept on passing Tyke had pizza that his dad brought home.  After chowing down he went with his dad to pick up his mom's van in the shop as it had been fixed.  So now Tyke has his car back.  And he is glad for that.  Once that was over he decided he would try to set something up.  He finally did and it involved hanging out at his house of course.  Amed and Macaroon came on over before being joined by Maniak.  They played some poke and although Amed was way up for a while Tyke turned his luck around and ended up being up 13 at the end of it.  But Kinker came in and took some of other people's money too so really everyone ended up about equal to what they put in.  Once they finished playing poker the big crowd came over.  Naan, MSwa, Tank, HeadRed, Dudely Doo, and Kalia all came over.  It was really cool to have a change of pace and have new people over.  They made it a great get together.  Tyke of course supplied the goods (pop and pizza) and everyone seemed to have a nice old time.  They watched ESPN, Wild Boyz, Seinfeld, and just talked up a good time.  It really did turn out to be the party house like his away message said.  So he had a great night.  And tomorrow he is gonna get his hair cut and then at night he's gonna try to get a group to go bowling at Hillcrest.  If you want to come just let Tyke know.
