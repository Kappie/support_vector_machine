You see here in Alberta we can get our license right when we turn 16, well me being the procrastinator that i am, i still haven't gotten it. so here i am am almost a year later and i'm just starting to learn how to drive. well i really doubt that any of you don't know this but it's winter out there, and icy roads and driving for the first time don't mix. This is why i have come to the conclusion that driving instructors are the worlds bravest people, they go out everyday day, rain or shine, snow or sleet, with people that have little or no driving skills and in 10 hours try to teach them how to be functioning members of driving society. all that's stands between them and certain doom is one tiny little brake peddle...what would happen on an icy road if that thing jammed up?........... -Matt
