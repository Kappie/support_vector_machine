I waited until about 10 am and belle was online, we were talking and stuff. Then about 11 she left her house with eva and yuri. And then they told me on the phone when they were all on the bus and stuff, i waited until they called me to tell me that they were ready to get picked up, cause me and my mom had to pick them up at the corner of middle neck and northern. So when they called from there, they told us where they were and me and my mom and my brother went and picked them up. It was funny cause they all looked older lol... I only knew belle and eva from junior high from years ago. Belle looked the same but very much thinner and yuri got really older looking and thinner as well. I had never met eva before, she was with her brother also.  After we picked them up, we drove a bit and stopped at the deli to get some drinks. I was really nervous cause i havent seen them in a long time and stuff. So then we hop back into the car and go over to my house. My mom dropped us off cause she had to go food shopping. While she was out, we were sitting around talking and watching tv and just playing around and stuff. The only thing that sucked at this little gettogether was that a couple people didnt come. Boris couldnt come for some personal reasons i wont discuss, and for some reason my friend Chris didnt come, i dont know why. I havent seen chris online since yesterday morning...  So we were playing around and joking. We played that game "shocking roulette" where u stick ur finger in, press start and it goes around in circles till it lands on a random person and gives them an electrical shock. Eva seemed to enjoy it..lol.  We then had the BBQ after my mom came home with the food and stuff. We went out side and i put in the charcoal and lit it. Waited till it got all white and then started cooking some hotdogs and shishkabob. And then out of no where, it starts to rain and i had to bring the grill to the porch which sucked. I had to cook it all in a tiny space with all of them sitting lol. No table either so it was even harder bending down near a hot flame. I think thats what gave me the big headache, inhaling all that smoke.  We played around a lot as well. We for some reason played truth or dare lol... And got all funny and sexual. It was hilarious. I had a real blast. We went upstairs to my room after eva's brother left cause he had to go to his prom and that was funny up there too. Eva put on some music and her and yuri were reggae dancing lol..  It was a fun party. It made me tired as hell but i still enjoyed it.
