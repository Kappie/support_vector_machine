Had a real big propotion of tuition.. a whopping 3 and a half hours totally sucking my energy dry..  Other than that I've really been lonely and moody at home, had to control my hunger for during the tuition... Missed my lunch, haha.  Sigh. Nothing much to say really, just staring at the books and the sky... while it pours heavily down my area...  Just hope I can pull off the paper well tomorrow..  Ja...
