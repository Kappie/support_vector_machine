I'm Oklahomophobic.    kaibo swabber  - Person who cleans portable toilets or who pumps septic tanks.  e.g., The kaibo swabber had failed to leave toilet paper in the porta-potty, which left Alex in an embarrasing situation.    telefellatio  - when you have to schmooze someone important over the telephone  e.g., Hey Bob If Mr. Big Cheese calls make sure you perform telefellatio on him    urlLink  pseudodictionary.com    I've been browsing their website for about a half an hour now, which is basically a dictionary of user-submitted sniglets, searching for a word to describe the situation I'm in. Not so much the situation really, but the feelings. Everyone has felt them at some point or another, maybe not both these feelings at the same time, but you've felt them at some time nevertheless.  A few weeks ago I picked up the book "The Tao of Pooh" by...  Actually, I don't have the book with me to tell you because I lent it to  dg . Anyway, the book has given me a new outlook on life in general, and I reccomend you pick it up. Its a great introduction to Taoism, and the author explains everything in a way that is very easy to understand. He compares aspects of Taoism to scenes from the Winnie the Pooh books, which surprisingly have a good amount of Taoism in them.  As mentioned before, the book has made me look at things differently. One of these things is girls. Alright, I know that I'm thirteen, and have no idea what I'm doing in terms of relationships, I don't know what love is, etc. Still, the only way to learn is to go out into the playing field... or something like that. I don't recall this as being one of the concepts in the book, but I've decided to tell people when I have feelings for them. I know I haven't told  ac , but I'm getting around to it... eventually...  I've been open about this when friends ask for advice involving the complex issues of middleschool love, and always tell them straight in the eye that the best thing they can do is tell the person exactly how they feel, and the worst thing that can happen then is that the person won't feel the same way, and that we will deal with the reaction when it comes. A big concept of Taoism I've been using in daily life is that we need to live in the present. We should be deciding what to do about how we feel about someone NOW, not how the person will react once you tell them LATER. I've had numerous discussions about this with (among other people)  dg  and her twin sister  kg . I've told them both that telling people how you feel is the best way to go.  Sometimes, you know, your advice can backfire on you.  Apparently  kg  has a crush on me. I know, big deal. Just tell her I don't like her, everything will be alright. I don't act different around people who like me, so whats the problem?  I don't know, this just feels different. We were good friends and stuff, and I really don't want to hurt her feelings.    ac   was the one who told me that   kg   liked me (and apparently has liked me for some time now) even though she wasn't supposed to.   kg   wanted to tell me herself, but I asked  ac  to tell me what kg told me she wanted to talk to me about earlier that day (she had mentioned that she wanted to talk to me about something, I had no idea what it was about).  ac  eventually broke down after hours of-- three minutes of interrogation, and here we are.  What to do? I don't know,  kg  will tell me tommorow.  ac  said she ( kg ) didn't want to tell me, because she thought I didn't like her, but  ac  told her to tell me anyway. I guess all I can do is take my own advice and tell  kg  how  I  feel.   On a lighter note, last night I bought the "Weezer: Video Capture Device - Treasures from the Bault 1991-2002," which is jampacked with music videos, behind the scenes footage, and other good stuff. Over three hours of video, great stuff...
