Like there was a million of people was there (just imagine). There was also 3 fairs that held at the same place so that makes the traffic go worsen.  So my friends and I decided to stay only for an hour. We could not get inside every booths. Actually just walk pass and have a peep. If it was interested than we go in if not, than just walk pass.   Any ways I got some opportunities to take pictures of the presenters there. They might not look too good, as I said that day was too crowded and I feel lazy to get them to the actions I want.   Anyways here is the  urlLink Link
