Topics will include life as a lawyer, practicing in Boston, job search and more.  Interested students can sign-up....  Two points: (1) Are topics like "life as a lawyer" and "practicing in Boston" really different for "students of color" than for "students of no color" (or whatever the appropriate opposite term is)  If they are, I think that would make a more interesting discussion than the topics themselves. (2) Is "students of color" a term that people are happy with?  It seems like it's just trying way too hard to be non-offensive, at the cost of being fairly vague and silly-sounding.
