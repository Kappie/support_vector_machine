Yesterday I checked out the campus, paid the sociology department a visit and got an apartment. Which was the highlight of my trip so far. I have a place to live! Woohoo! Today I just took a tour of the campus and now I'm killing time in a computer lab. I have no idea what I'm going to do tonight or all day tomorrow... probably kill time at the mall.  I think life will be more exciting once I know the area and make friends.  ***
