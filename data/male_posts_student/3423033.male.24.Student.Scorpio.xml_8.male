I don't know where I'll be in a few months, so we'll have to wait and see what happens.   Cassie called me again tonight, and left a text saying that she messed up and thinks of me and wants me to call her or something. I don't see where she messed up really bad. I asked her one day if I would ever see her again, back when we were dating, because we really didn't hang out, we just fucked. She would send me these long boring ass emails about shit I don't even know what she was trying to explain about, before I got an answer that it wasn't working. WTF? Get to the damn point. And I think she should get to the point now that she just wants it. No weird emotional BS. I don't have time for it. She fucking drinks way too much anyways. I don't think I can deal with hanging out with a girl with no aspirations, no dreams, and two 40's strapped to her hands. Sex? That's a different story.
