After surviving a family trip to Disneyland and the LA Galaxy game, I'm here talking to you my loyal viewer....(s).  The game was fun, but it was a tie.  But....I got the best 5 dollar horn blowie thing ever!  You blow into it, and it like, makes lots of noise.  So that was the best 5 dollars I ever spent in one night.  Fireworks were insane.  I swear to god I thought I was going to like, die or something.  Friggin' loud ass explosions.  Shockwaves went everywhere.  It was like....BOOM!  Thank god I didn't like go deaf or something.  Yah anyway, its hot as hell, and I have a swimming pool...Ta.
