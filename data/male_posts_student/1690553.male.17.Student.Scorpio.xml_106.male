It's just arrived when I went there on Thursday night. Talk about being lucky. ;-)  I'm a fast reader, so I pretty much 'devoured' the book and finished it at 3 in the morning. Really fast paced and exciting with suprising twist of  urlLink plots  and riddles. Dan Brown is such a good author with immense details, impeccable research and gripping storyline. So gripping that I feel like I'm in Paris myself. :-D How I wish to set foot on Europe someday without studying there.   Meanwhile,  urlLink Azleen  had started teaching Dr. Wahab's son Danish Bahasa Malaysia. A year in UK had made Danish's written BM quite sloppy and he got pretty much confused in reading as he refused to practice. Dr. Wahab asked me to find a post-SPM friend to teach so I reccomended her as Hasnul can't take the job. Oh well, didn't know that Azleen love kids so looks like she would be a good teacher. After all, she is one of the best student in SMART.
