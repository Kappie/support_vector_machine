English was easy. Physics, mm, I don't know. When I started making the test, I didn't knew one answer. At the end I started again from the last question to the first. That went better. Afterwards I went to get some ice cream with Albert. I have no clue what to do with him. Where I stand in his eyes. Does he like me, doesn't he like me? First we were like 3 days of the week together after school. But since he has this girlfriend it's more like one day in 3 weeks. I don't know if I like him anymore for doing this. I try to spend as much time as possible with him, but he can't expect that everything should come from my side. And besides, when I try to get some time with him, he always comes with the remark: 'oh, i'll see if niki (his girlfriend) can come'. At those times I'd rather just walk away from him. About 2 hours ago, the dog needed to walk. So I asked Tjitske to come join me. She came. We had fun, we have this role playing game going on. It sounds childish, it is, but its fun. I really wanted to talk to her seriously, but neither she or me was in the mood for it. We were too busy laughing. Debbie asked me to play this computergame a while ago when I was online. It seems like if I got friends. But this is more a coincidence of friend-like events. At the moment everybody seems to have a girl/boyfriend, except me. Why doesn't anyone love me enough?
