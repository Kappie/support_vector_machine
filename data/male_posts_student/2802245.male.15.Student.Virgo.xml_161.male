Right, I'll be releasing a screen of Episode 2 soon, as soon as i get all the graphics i'll be needing ripped.  *Bit about beckett deleted cause beckett didnt like it* - edited by beckett  Changed storyline of Episode 2, got a much better one. I'll just say that there'll be a 'duelling' battle, called the Plunge, where the two opponents run up to each other and jump up, and attack. There'll be blade arts possibly if I can be bothered to grab them, but you'll understand all. Red hair to all!  Tull,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
