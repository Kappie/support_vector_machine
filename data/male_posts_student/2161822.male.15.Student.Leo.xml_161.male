Like playing with water balloons and a giant slingshot. It works great (We were standing on the side of the basketball court and a balloon managed to clear the other side of the fence and half of the road.), but it would work even better if we had 3 people. This is the cue for all of you people to come to the court and enjoy the giant slingshot with us. Yes it was wishful thinking. But hey, how can't you have fun when the warning on the slingshot reads:    Warning! Balloons can reach or exceed a speed limit of 75 mph. Never shoot at another person
