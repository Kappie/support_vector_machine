At least, I got to watch Spiderman 2 a little on time, and in the big screen. The movie was definitely not disappointing for me. We've been doing a reasonable amount of reviewing too, Joy and I.  'Better take advantage of the "sinisipag akong mag-aral" phases.  We also listened and reminisced and criticized whatever CDs we had over the weekend.. we bought the three Almost Kinda Acoustic albums (1-3) tsktsk.. pirated of course (ssshhhhhh!!!)  Here're some that we rattled about:  *  Babyface  (Greatest Hits)        .. how good Babyface is and how many songs he must have already written.. how does he do it?!  And he's left-handed in playing the guitar.  *  50 First Dates  soundtrack       Some thought it's gonna be the usual CORNY.. SAPPY collection of love songs that'd make one wanna say eck.  But it really is not the usual.. it's sort of island-ish (even the movie, which for me, was good).. i mean, when you play the tracks, you could just close your eyes and see the coconut trees, sarongs, long hair flying, native huts, full moon, and a bunch of those ethnic  butingtings .      Some didn't even wanna see the movie or listen to the CD coz it's gonna be so mushy.. corny.. well I guess they just went ahead and said what they thought without even asking what it was about or how the songs actually sound.. hhh!      But ANYWAY, though most of the songs were just versions of the originals, they were quite good.  AND! Israel "IZ" Kamakawiwo'ole's "Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World" version was just awesome.. really great song to have been played at the end of the movie.. it's kinda unfortunate though that it's not in the soundtrack.  "Forgetful Lucy" was okay anyway, but not half as good.  *  A Walk to Remember  soundtrack     ..how it sounded represented like how it was in the movie..  Don't miss: Dare You to Move, Learning to Breathe, and You .. (yeah right, it WAS so long ago!)   Okay okay, we're leaving, 'have to end this.  Watch Spiderman!
