Was born in Moldova or to be more accurate, Besarabia, Chisinau, the capitol city.   I was born in the 27th of August 1988. Today I live in Israel, Haifa and going up to 11th grade (out of 12).   What else can I say? Tommorow I'll start writing my blog, guess I'll write it as an open diary.  See you soon.
