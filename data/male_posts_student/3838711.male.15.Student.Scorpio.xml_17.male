School isnt as enjoyable as it really seems.. to me, its just a place where i have to slog my guts out for half the day before the cold rounded metal rounded piece of metal rings, and a crowd of happy guys rushing out, all set to head back home, or just hang out, have some fun, before heading to the comfort where they always spend surfing, watching TV... all the things that teenagers can do at home.  Maybe Aaron was right, one tends to be the person he is behind a face. And that face, is the thing i'm looking to right now. the PC. I'm my real self here, having all said the stuff i've been keeping inside my hearts. All this blogging seemed to have freed me a bit from my bottling up of emotions, words, and expressions. Saved me from making things into a bunch of mess, and then just worrying and thinking of someway out. Do i really have that much to say? I mean, i'm quiet and all in school, with friends, and parents. But, in this blog, says a thousand words i would like to have poured out to someone. A listening ear, which i couldnt find.  These days the rain had the coolness going, despite i still havent the mood to pick up from where i left off before the holidays. Managing to scrape 3 passes out of 6 subjects isnt the scene where i would like to be caught in.. and i very much fear what i can pull off this semester, with all this stuff hitting me hard.  So who said i was vulgar. Who said i was nutty, crazy, and cracking jokes, funny or lame. I didnt really mean what the heck i'm talking about, they just came out of this mouth of mine. I'm lost... maybe my life has once again shattered itself into pieces that i'll have to try glue it back.. and the moment it didnt hold it all together, the low tide will once again approach me, and be with me for a period of time it feels contented, and i can get on with life. Move on, no one's gonna wait for you.. Time doesnt. Tide dont. Friends neither. The special someone... i have none.  Having the house all to myself tonight was a really great idea, no parents nagging for 1 night. But it really pulled the innermost tinglings of my hearts out into words i tried to type, but still, they just stayed as if they were parasites. Sad, but true.  She didnt give much of a reply after all, well maybe she wasnt interested at all. Hey, with someone of my quality, i find it common that loneliness will be here to stay. At least it did, for 15 coming to 16 years of my life. Worthless me.  Will anyone tell me what to do.... I'm in darkness trying to find some kind hand to lead me out....
