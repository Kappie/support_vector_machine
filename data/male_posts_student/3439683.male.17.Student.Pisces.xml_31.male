Gonna have that get-together on Saturday, need some more people to come, though. But that's nothing. Big thing that's going on? My mom found this site, read my blog. To make it short, my counselor is sending me to see a psychiatrist. what for? you guess. Thing is though, I don't want pills, a medically induced happiness, that's how I see it. Call me ignorant if you want to. Don't really care. I'd rather my problems be solved the way I want them to be solved. You know what I'm talking about. If I have to wait for it, well, damn, I'll just wait for it. Even if it never comes. But I don't want to take pills. Happiness isn't found in a bottle.
