"your show was so bad, even tivo would reject the repeats." "dr. dre is here tonight. make sure to thank him when he brings your car out for you." "of course he doesn't do drugs. what is he, 6'3", 110 pounds? of course he doesn't." "he's so skinny he could use a kotex wrapper as a sleeping bag."  blah, i've kinda lost the mood i was in when i wanted to write this (damn you dennis leary roast), but i still know what i want to write. i've been sitting here all day ignoring most people online and feeling crappy about myself without knowing why. maybe just one of those valleys i've dipped into after climbing a peak. yea whatever. it's a little deeper...after playing basketball tonight (because i forced myself to go outside), i walked and thought, that wasn't too fun, i want to play with somebody. then i realized...who would i really truly enjoy playing with? sure, i thought of quite a few people, but the point remains...can you get bored of your friends? can you get bored of the same old? can you get bored of being the same restrained, introverted person you always were? yes. i can. look at me the past couple of years. same exact thing. just kinda going out of my way to not doing anything with girls...i just get nervous or aloof or shy or act completely neutral. so i feel stupid, and girls just kinda wash over me.   that's why i started school the way i did last year...erik, jenn, pat, they know what i'm talking about. i was different...i don't even remember. i guess i was louder and more social and stuff. "it's both good and bad," pat said. but i guess i enjoyed it...it was fun. something new for me. i wasn't restricting myself as much? but then of course i said something that in retrospect i would have never done. i never realy understood why i did it, but now looking at it, i believe it was just because i wanted to know how everybody would react, if things would get better. of course they didn't...kinda went downhill. and i got bitter and reverted to my old self. i don't know how, but a secret just isn't a secret today so long as people desperately search for conversation-starters. iï¿½m just expected to be inconspicuous and unmemorable (if that's a word). that's all it is...expectations and reality. and if i act differently..."stop pretending to be somebody else!" and that's where i am again, today.  yes, jen wrote about this way back in the beginning of the school year, but haven't you ever wished to be somewhere that nobody knew you and you had the freedom to be who you really wanted to be?
