Luckily, I can ALways count on Richie for comic relief, perpetuALly saying something in French ever so confidently, yet drenched in errors.  During Speech, my group prepared for a fate vs. free will debate (I'm arguing for fate) by sharing subtopics to discuss. I was the de facto leader, for it seemed that I had actuALly done thorough research, though I just brought in related articles that came to mind and quickly formed opinions and ideas based upon them. It was okay, except for when another in the group said "Oh, so I'm just a sack of cells; I don't have any emotions [etc.]" and I kind of insulted Roman Catholicism (my least favorite religion), to which half of my group belongs. Still, gouda nonetheless.  I think I'm going to do that Prague trip next summer, if ever.  Gym was tolerable for a change; I kind of like soccer.  I had a moldy sandwich today. I ate half of it before I noticed. Oh well, gouda leverage.  In math, my favorite class, I suggested that, for the last day of school, we eat a Fibonacci pizza, in which the slices go out in a spirAL. Ms. Green, my teacher, said yes, if I could make one. I think I will.
