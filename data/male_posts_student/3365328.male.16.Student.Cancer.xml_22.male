It's about a class of school kids in a future Japan, where the adults fear the many children who play truant 800,000 at a time, who under a new government act, get sent to a remote island. There, they are handed random objects (some of which are weapons) and told to kill each other within 3 days down to the last person, or all of them will blow up. And to top it all off, the 'winner' of the last battle royale and a random psycho are thrown in as well. The bloody chaos that ensues involves lots of killings, accidental deaths, deceit and lots of blood!   Needless to say, you should watch this film in all it's eastern glory. Only the japanese could make this, I tell you...  And to top off why you should see it, thanks to their censors working overtime, you won't find it anywhere in the USA! Ho, ho, ho...
