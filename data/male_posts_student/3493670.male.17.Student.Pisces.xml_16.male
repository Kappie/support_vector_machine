We are bio-engineered to produce offspring and ensure the survival of the human species, but when we survey potential DNA donors, we suspect its time to chlorinate the gene pool. I remember something I heard in an otherwise idiotic movie: Guys are like parking spaces. All the good ones are taken, and the available ones are handicapped.      Okay, not all men are dogs. There are a lot of great guys out there; unfortunately they're already taken. Women who take an ethical stand against poaching are at a disadvantage (see what good behavior gets you). Sometimes the most you can hope for is a trainable puppy, one that won't pee all over the house.     Occasionally you meet an apparently perfect specimen. He's smart, funny, attractive, sensitive, articulate, cultured, dresses well. He even cooks. The first question that pops into your head is not, "is he seeing anyone?" The first question is, "is he gay?" And if the answer to both questions is no, What is wrong with him?      The debate in homosexuality still rages. We're not sure whether the person is born gay or becomes gay, but it seems that there are more gay men today than in previous decades. The explanation could simply be that the population is bigger, so the number of gays is proportionately larger. It could be that since homosexuality is no longer classified as a disease, it is considerably less traumatic to come out of the closet, so it would appear that there are more gays in the present era. In any case, humans are an admirably adaptable group, and women are making adjustments. I see a trend in straight women-gay men relationships. It makes perfect sense. After all, empathy and shared interests are essential to relationships. Who would better understand your need to hand a Keanu Reeves poster in your room?      I have three flagrantly gay friends who are currently embroiled in relationships with women. Perhaps they were closet heterosexuals. Maybe these are tidings of the apocalypse. Much to everyone's consternation, they look happy. Don't knock happiness, it doesn't happen very often.      I have two theories on the apparent gay population explosion. One, Nature is addressing the problen of overpopulation on this planet by limiting the number of propagators. As far as I know, gay men cannot give birth, although if the straight women-gay men syndrome persists, this theory goes kaput. Two, the theory of natural selection tells us that individuals which adapt better to their environment tend to survive and perpetuate the species. This leads to genetic changes and eventually, to the origin of new species. Among humans, we look for partners with the qualities that will ensure the continuation of our lineage. With every generation we strive for improvement, and therefore greater survivability. But what happens when the line has fulfilled its potential and produced individuals as charming as their DNA can aspire for? At this point mixing chromosones with other individuals would not lead to further improvement. So the individuals become gay.      Yesterday, I heard another theory from my friend Greaser. It is in equal parts conspiracy theory, urban legend, and paranoid ranting. It involves "nutribuns."     In the 1970s, to promote better nutrition among schoolchildren, the government provided free nutrient enhanced bread called "nutribuns." According to Greaser, these buns did not just contain nutrients. They not only addressed the problem of malnutrition, but also the problem of rapid population growth. How?      "By making children gay," Greaser said, darkly.      "WHAT?"      "It was an experiment. European scientists used the buns to spread drugs that promote homosexuality," he said. "Homosexuality limits population growth. In the past, only upper-class people could come out of the closet. They could afford to flout convention. These days, people of all economic classes can come out of the closet. Many of these people ate nutribuns."      "You're a freak," I told him. "I ate nutribuns and I'm not gay."      "But you have many gay friends," he said. You are beyond fag hag. You are a haggot." He raised an eyebrow. I raised an eyebrow. I had the sudden urge to watch  Spartacus.
