For anyone that's reading this and doesn't know who I am, I'm not entirely sure why you're here, but feel free to keep reading. My name is Jeff Guebert (my last name is where the title of my blog comes from, courtesy of one of my friends about 10 years ago), I'm 17, and I live in Dallas. There, you know me now.  I'll probably get around to writing a more interesting (and longer) post tomorrow. For now, though, it's time to go to sleep...
