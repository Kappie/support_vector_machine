There were more people there than I had ever seen before, and keep in mind I'm including the night when   Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix   was released. Not just could they not fit everyone in the store, they couldn't fit everyone onto the STREET OUTSIDE. The line stretched around the corner of Connecticut and went almost all the way down Ne-bloody-braska Avenue. There I waited for over an hour, in the dark, in the heat, surrounded by my fellow liberals. There was merchandise hocking here, too, this time in the form of charming anti-Bush pins (which I would have gladly bought if not for my lack of cash at the time.) The whole thing involved me standing for long periods of time so now my back hurts. I'm off to lie down now.  Oh, and one more thing - I met Barney Frank! He's one feisty little devil, I'll tell you what.
