There was nothing like buying a scrumptious melon pan and pokari sweat in the morning and embarking on an invigorating journey to Osaka’s Umeda area to browse manga, visit Sega World or just plain hang.  I’m probably about four issues behind on my favorite manga, WEED, at the moment and haven’t been able to ogle a current issue of Famitsu for months.  And every Friday I would catch a rerun of the best Japanese cartoon no one outside of Japan knows about: Doraemon.  I still have plenty of school in front of me, so I’m stuck firmly in the US of A for the moment, but I plan on applying for the JET program as soon as I get my BA.  In the meantime I purchase/watch the occasional anime and try to improve my Japanese to help keep me feeling connected to my home away from home.    That reminds me,  Lost in Translation  comes out on DVD in a few weeks and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in seeing the quirks of modern Japanese culture (that and Bill Murray is funny as hell).  It was the best movie of 2003 in my opinion, but I’m also completely biased, as it was acutely natsukashi (dear; desired; missed).  The movie has received critical acclaim from virtually all major film reviewing entities though, so don’t just take my word on it.
