Anyways, my mom's birthday today. I got her Tower of Power Live CD. Uh, What Is Hip? Today in band I had to play my NYSSMA solo in front of the band, scary as hell, I went too fast also. So for dinner I went out to Butterfields with my family and grandma. It was great, my mom and I laughed at grandma alot and I tried to convince my grandma that communism isn't bad, it's just that Stalin changed it to a totalitarian regime. But it's near impossible to convince someone who lived the Red Scare that communism isn't bad. Uh, I got Kaiser pissed off by trying to convince to him I wouldn't insult him if I was the drummer for his group for acoustic cafe. He's a good guitarist, he just can't do originals and that's why it didn't work before but now it can because we're doing covers which he has the ability to do, but Matt didn't listen, broke out in an emotional breakdown and started raping 3rd graders in his neighborhood. I don't blame him. 3rd graders are when girls are in full bloom. Whatever that means. Hey it's cool how the paragraph makes stairs of spaces going down leftwards down the page...nevermind you guys don't know what I'm talking about. Happy Birthday mom. I haven't drummed on my set since Monday, I'm gonna freak out. A certain tint of olive. I think I'm gonna make a website that's gonna have my book on it. I'm gonna make a book. It'll be updated like every couple of days or week or so and it'll be a continueing story, still thinking about what...AH HA GOT IT!
