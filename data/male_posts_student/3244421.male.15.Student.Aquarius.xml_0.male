MLEH!   lol Its a combination of Meh and something lol It means......   kinda bored with life- ready for school to get out.......don't care about grades at the moment- feel like u need to go somewhere exciting...  Thanks Katie, for helping me decide the title for the mood that I am in.  I have to give Props to my homie..... Tim B.
