Dinner sucked as usual, any time i spend with my family sucks. Came downstairs and fucked around some more listened to music talked to people on aim talked to people on msn yadda yadda it's 12 am now and i spent my whole day talking to people, how socially productive.  Lyric of the moment: "Now I'm lyin' on the table with everything you said it will, all catch eventually, will it caught up, and honestly, the weight of my decisions were impossible to hooold, but they were never(they were never) they were never yours!" -Band: Taking Back Sunday; Song: I Know you Know
