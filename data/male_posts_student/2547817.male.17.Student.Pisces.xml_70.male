Have been listening to blink a lot lately. It used to help, but now it's just another futile attempt at making myself feel better.  Shyama told me today the names of the top 10 who have been selected. End of the line Tim. Worthlessness has more value than what I perceive of myself right now. 24 of us in round two, 10 of them in round 3. I'd thought to myself that if I were to make it to top ten, whether or not I got the scholarship would not be important anymore, because by then, I'd have proven my own worth to the only person I needed to prove it to. Myself.  What really hurts is that the people to whom I am especially close to within the circle of 24 got selected for the top 10. Jolyn, Sharmini, Shyama, Leon and Shawn. DAMMIT!! WHY WASN'T I WORTH IT!?  This entity- Life- is not a kind soul. One mistake and it kicks you in the ass. I wish I could hit rewind. I want to change it. I have to change it. I CANNOT be just another person, who comes, lives and dies. That is not what I'm meant to be. Don't think I'm righteous, blame your own lack of vision.  Worst part is that I might loose some of my closest friends when it's all done. I don't mean to be selfish, but...  Somebody help me. I'm due to crash and burn.
