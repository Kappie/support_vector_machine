"Call you some other day." "Nothing to talk" "Nothing." "Ic." "Ok" and yada yada yada. DAMnIT!!! I'm so fucking pissed off and don't ask why. I hold my tears as I do not want to cry everyday for no fucking reason. I was glad at first you called, but you ended up ruined my night. Or should I say I ruined my own? I don't know and do not want to know what was in your mind. I asked you whther your "IC" and "OK" shows that you are no longer interested in continuing our conversation, and you bloody throw me a "yes". It hurts alot. I hung up as you wished, and you bloody call back just to tell me "bye". Are you trying to piss me more or what? If you have nothing else better to say, don't call. If you have nothing else better to do, call people whom you trust, not me, the one who you no longer trust. Is not like I'm telling you not to call me anymore, but that's just all your wish as because you think I'm not worth to talk with. It's like a "fine" to me, as I don't have to power to use a gun, and point at you, and begged you to call me. I enjoy talking to you, but today seems to turn upside down and don't ask me why. I just don't know. Maybe because you're stressed with your studies, and so on, and I'm stressed with prefectorial board, homeworks, families, friends, and everything. Maybe I did sound very sleepy when you tried to tell me something, but I did change after that. I'm just so sorry and I don't think you want to continue reading my blog. So, bah, that's it. Tatz.   *wrote something yesterday night, right after you call me to tell me "bye". Suddenly felt like something bad is going to happen once again, or should I say I think too much. Anyway, writing out everything is one of my ways   to release howI feel. Bah, I cant post it here, 'cause I'm blur with this system. I uploaded it in the upload site. Go see if you want. Or I *think* I'll send it to you. Bah, whatever. Tata.
