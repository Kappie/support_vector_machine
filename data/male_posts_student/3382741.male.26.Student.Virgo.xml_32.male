The only thing that has happened recently worth posting about is a phone call I got last Fri night (at least I think that's when it was). It was at 4am so I was really asleep when I got it. Seem that my last X (Richard from atlanta) was moving to greenville this past weekend. He called at 4am to tell me this. Again remember that I am almost completely asleep ... so about all I say is "oh yeah" and maybe "cool". It was clear that I was not thrilled by this info. He kinda lingered on the phone ... I think he was waiting for me to be real excited and happy that he was here now ... it wasn't going to happen. Even now, days and days later, I am still not really sure where I stand on that. I almost want to try to be friends with him but then I kinda want to simply ignore him like he did me. Thereare no romantic feelings there anymore at all; I have a great b/f and don't need anyone else. hmmm guess since I haven't called him back in this long I won't. If he makes and effort to be friends with me then I will consider it (it's not a certainty); if not then I won't contact him again prolly. oh well it was his loss way back when ....  David is still in Las Vegas. He is not having a good time at all. Seems he isn't learning anything like he thought he would (I could have guessed that would be the case). The guy he is with is being a jerk. And things are generally not good out there with him. But, he will be home Thursday and we can put the trip and that guy behind us becuase he is not worth the trouble or time.  One other thing of note. I have a job interview at Clemson for a full time potision. I have no idea yet how this would affect my school if I got it, but one thing is clear ... I can't go on with no money forever. Keep your fingers crossed that I get it.
