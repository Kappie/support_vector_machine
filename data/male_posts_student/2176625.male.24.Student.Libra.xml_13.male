I want to start something right now, I don't care if there thousands of miles separating us, but distance matters to her. Nevermind the fact we've known each other for several years. Nevermind the fact we have a connection. There is nothing left for me to do except wait until I move in July. She is bull headed and stubborn, I don't reckon she'll change her mind. Honestly my date with Malia wasn't great, it wasn't what I was expecting.  Malia was just a distraction because she's here, not to mention easy . Not that we had sex; we didn't, she wanted to. Shit, I wanted to. It didn't feel right. Has this 'player' been reformed? You could say that 4 years of a committed monogamous relationship changed me. After having that with Leslie I want it again. I am looking ahead, thinking about permanently settling down.  I want to get married and that time is coming soon. Never thought I'd say that eh? Damn what did everybody expect? I'm not 20 anymore. These 4 years have made a difference. The frat boy everyone knew is grown up paying my rent, bought a new truck, I have a career, granted it's not where I want to be but in a few years I will be "Dr. R. S. Kalabastia", rollin in the Benjamins. Thas right, initials only so I will feel professional. Fuck it, I'm still obnoxious.
