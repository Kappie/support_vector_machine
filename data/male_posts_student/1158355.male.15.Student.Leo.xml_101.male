Today, I went to the mall, bought the Disturbed CD 'Believe', a Tool shirt along with a disturbing Tool poster with I think Maynard coming out of the water staring up into the sky. I didn't figure out what it was until 3 days after I bought it. So obviously this sentence is an update on this day... I'm actually writing this on the 12th but everything else in this blog is on the 6th except for all the Tool/Matrix shit below, that's just that. Before these 3 days I thought the neck was its messed up face or something... weird. Ok, back to the 6th, when I came home from shopping, Heaton came over, he's still over now and Kaiser is comin' soon. James was gonna' come but he was at Dan B's. Ok, they all left... I'm by myself listening to Tool and reading these lyrics which relate completely to the matrix. One song actually ACTUALLY SAYS "THEY'RE MAKING A DREAM FOR YOU AND ME"... this song was covered by Tool originally by Led Zeppelin...so I think the Wachowski Bros. (Makers of The Matrix) listen to all this great music and put it all together to make on giant bubble of thought and belief.  PLEASE TAKE TIME TO READ THESE (I've made italic of the important shit)   ---Tool - Third Eye (Aenima Album Version) -Bill Hicks: See I think, drugs have some done good things for us. I really do. And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us. Do me a favor, go home tonight, take all your albums, all your tapes, and all your CDs, and burn them. 'Cause you know what? The musicians who made all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years? Reeeeeeeal fucking high on drugs. Today young men on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one conciousness experiencing itself subjectively,  there is no such thing as death, life is only dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves . Here's Tom with the weather. It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom is what it is, okay?. Keep that in mind at all times, thank you.   Dreaming  of that face again.  It's bright and blue and shimmering.  Grinning wide and comforting me with it's three warm and wild eyes.  On my back and  tumbling  down that hole  and back again  rising up and wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye.   ---Tool - Sweat -  Seems like I've been here before. Seems so familiar. Seems like I'm slipping into a dream within a dream . It's the way you whisper. It drags me under and takes me home.  (I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE = DEJA VU = THE MATRIX.... DREAM WITHIN A DREAM = THE MATRIX   ---Tool - No Quarter (Cover of Led Zep) - Lock the door, kill the light. No one's coming home tonight. The sun beats down and don't you know? All our lives are growing cold, oh... They bring news that must get through.  To build a dream for me and you , oh.  (REAL WORLD WAR, HIDE FROM ROBOTS, THE SUN IS GONE FROM OPERATION DARK STORM, WE WILL DIE OF FROST, THE ROBOTS WILL MAKE THE MATRIX FOR US) I'm sure Led Zeppelin had a completely different meaning for these words but Tool saw it in the same way I see it... related to The Matrix. (=   ---Tool - Spasm - As you stare into the water, are you scared you'll be forgotten? As you stare into the water.  This one made me think for a while and I finally came up with something, it's the last people in the real world seeking true nature and having fear that nature and them won't be with history any longer, for fate is for AI for the rest of Earth's future.   ---Parabola - see the lyrics yourself, they're so intertwined with The Matrix. Also check the lyrics for all the other "Lateralus" songs but definetly check Ticks and Leeches and Lateralus. Ticks and Leeches supposedly speaks about killing the robots. "YOU CHOKE!!!"All these songs are by Tool.  Then there's one song called 'Faaip De Oiad' where some former employee of Area 51 claims aliens are invading and the government knows about it, yet ceases to do anything and to save the people into secret hiding spots but he says the govt. wants the aliens who are "extradimensional" to destroy the major cities so that the govt. has an easier way of controlling very few areas. I believe this is a real transmission from a very frightened man.
