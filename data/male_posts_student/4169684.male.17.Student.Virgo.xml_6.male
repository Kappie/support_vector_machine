Fuck it I've given up everything for you  My time, my love and my life Yet somehow it wasn't enough Instead you felt that you could lie to me Cheating me out of my happiness While not forgetting of others  I've been used, and now lay with a knife in my back I'd pull it out, but I fear of my emotions spilling on the floor The knife, it now holds me together As the pain helps me realize how much of a fool I was And will never be again  These mixed feelings of pain and wanting Need only see the repercussions of your actions As I see you've stepped on my heart With your new nine inch, spiked heel shoes So with no heart, I wish to leave you with these words  Good luck finding someone who feels for you the way I did Good luck with looking at yourself in the mirror every morning As you realize what it is you actually did And lastly, good luck living your life as a lie  As I might not have been everything you were looking for But I had one thing you could've used As a conscience could have been useful in this matter Where your contradictory ways won't seem to flatter  I hope your happy now, cause I know I'll soon be As one day this knife in my back Will soon be marked "return to sender" And believe me, it will hurt more than you know
