The first three days of the week attempt to make us forget about the previous weekend.  Thursdays are anticipatory.  It's Friday eve, if you will.  It's primary identity is linked with being the day closest to the weekend without actually being the weekend.  It's almost but not quite officially the weekend.  To me, Thursdays usher in the time for celebration, for Friday is coming up and with it the weekend.  This is how I see the kingdom of God.  Jesus is constantly saying that the kingdom is upon us, but he also prays that the kingdom will come.  It's here, and it's coming.  It's in our midst, and it's just beyond our intellectual grasp.  The one thing I know about Thursdays is that I participate more fully in the weekend when I am intentional about my treatment of the day that comes before.  Perhaps the same can be said of the kingdom of God.
