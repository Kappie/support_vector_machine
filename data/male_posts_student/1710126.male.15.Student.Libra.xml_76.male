One of more resolutions was to change the way i am, so lets list down the points i want to get rid of: -control freak I was always a control freak, juz didn't show it to some people, people who worked with me usually know how domineering i can get...so i hope i can change that. -insults i m very prone to lashing out at people when i m stressed or unhappy, so i need to watch my tongue. -Sloth I am juz plain lazy sometimes, so i need to learn to kick myself in the arse hard to get things going...  okae lets start...
