Before this i never tried it before.. and it never seem exciting for me..  Well for your info.. i've to take this as a Physical Education Session in my school Ngee Ann.. each student is to choose a sport of their own.. and go thru some lessons for the 1st year..  Songs... I always have a dilemma in trying to find a song to put at my webbie.. at first i wanna put song A.. but once i hear song B.. i wanna put put song B.. then suddenly i try to hear song C.. and i wanna put song C.. haiz.. so finally i decided to settle down with this track in the background..  --------------  Guys and girls.. if there's no more sparkle in your love relationship.. do you still carry on? or what do u do?...  -------------  Exams, Tests, Projects... aaarrggghhh....
