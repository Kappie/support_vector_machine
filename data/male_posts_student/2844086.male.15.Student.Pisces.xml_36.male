I had already been keeping a practice journal, but since it ties in with her site,  urlLink here , she asked me to put online.  So anyway, I guess I can share a little light on who I am. I'm 15 years old and I go to Wayne County High School. To read more about that click  urlLink here . I've been taking piano lessons for 5 years in August, and I've been taking voice lessons for almost a year.  I'll be recording: my practice, problems I'm having with songs, how songs make me feel, etc. Now there is one rule for me, and i'll share it with y'all.  NO PERSONAL STUFF  in this journal. Of course if the song makes me feel someway about what's going on in my life at the moment, I might let  that  slide. I learn from the Bastien Piano books series. I'll post a list of the books I have if anyone wants them (that's only about 6 or 7!). And I should post practice everyday, except Sundays. Rarely do I practice on Sundays.  So i hope that you find my blog slightly helpful in your musical journey!  :) HAVE A GREAT DAY! AND PRACTICE!  Oh yeah and if you want to drop me a line, my e-mail is Godsdude4life@hotmail.com
