     Well there. After a morning spent wading through CSS and HTML, I have pulled together an acceptable site (I think). I have very little experience with web design, so I don't care if its not perfect, I'm pretty proud of myself. Even made the title image all by myself, cutting letters out of a 1997 issue of Ultra Game Players magazine. My eyes hurt, and I need exercise, so I am going outside to cut the grass.
