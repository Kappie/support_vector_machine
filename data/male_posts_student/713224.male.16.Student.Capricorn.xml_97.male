The movie has a good amount af subtle dark humor, which I love, only this movie didn't make me have too many huffs or grins over its jokes. Part of it might be that I didn't give it much attention, and I watched it with many pauses in between, but I still wouldn't go out of my way to see it again. I give this movie:    ***  **
