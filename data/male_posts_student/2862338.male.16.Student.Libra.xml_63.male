It's memorial day, and after a long and crazy weekened, i'm just way to tired to describe my thoughts about things.  Looking back at my entry, it's alittle assholish i know, but shit, wtf am i suppose to do, ya know? i don't want to, but i have NOO money right now.  Whatever, knowing me,it'll prolly fade away, but i'm gonna drive alot less now.  o, um....shit, nevermind...if i type it, i'll get eveyone's mouths working.  Oh, btw, i haven't been on AIM for awhile cause i have no com.  The convertion from my case to the one i bought off Czank is taking longer than expected, so for now, i'm not gonna use it.  I mean, it's at the point where i could, but i'm not gonna risk anything....anyway, thats it, ta ta
