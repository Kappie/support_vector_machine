She used to sign my guestbook every once in a while back in the awakeatmidnight days. And we've been to a lot of the same shows and know a lot of the same people from the Bently/Rimbey area. But she can't come. I suppose I will have to make some phone calls today.  Inventory last night was hell. Well, not so much last night, but this morning is. I am like, deathly ill. My insides are swimming, and everytime I try to eat something, I just feel sick. Blah. Then I'm going to the show tonight, I'm sure tomorrow morning won't be much better. In fact, I'm almost scared to drive home tonight. Oh boy.  Well, I'm just updating before heading back to work. *crosses fingers for tuesday off*.   Oh. I was thinking of You.
