Well, it's not important.  I have a problem. I have to get up at 6:00 in the morning. This is too early for my system, or at least this is what my system is telling me. You think, 6 isn't that bad. 11:00 to 6:00 is only 7 hours. On a good day. So when I wake up, I go take a shower, and then go back to bed. This is my problem. I need my sleep, but I need to get up. This hasn't been solved yet, and has caused many rushed mornings. I need a solution. A real one. "Go to bed early" does me as much good as "Sleep upside-down".  /personal rant  (putting the /quip at the end of posts is fun. It gives you a sense of completion and a feeling of making up for any lackings in the previous writing. you should try it.)  /friday post  ;0)
