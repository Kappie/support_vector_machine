Now, I won't do that, but I understand that a sentence post isn't enough. I have been looking over my past posts, and the longest ones are the friday five. I want to change that, so here I go.  My life sucks right now. My  car  threw a rode, so I don't have a car. When the Land Rover went, my mom went out and bought a  urlLink VW Beetle . It is a nice car, but it is stick. I don't like stick. But this means that in July, August I get a new used car. lol. New used. I get to pick it, but it can't be THAT expensive. I'm thinking on from Thrifty because they have a 6 year, 60,000 miles warrenty, which is hard to beat with other Used Car dealerships. A good thing though, I am going to England in 10 days. I still haven't packed yet. lol. This trip is gonna be soooooooo exciting. I can't wait. When I'm at my homestay in England, I get to stay in a 17th century country mansion, and I get to swim in the indoor pool, and I also get to learn how to play cricket. The lady I'm staying with son is home from "University" and he will teach me how to play. I'm so excited, I can't wait!
