Will we never see page tinkle the ivories on his baby grand, or Joe C or Greasy Fizeek or Henrietta, or whatever Fish's name is that night, pick up his vacuum and play something, Somewhere Over the Rainbow, or Terrapin. Will we never see another Trey face, another Mike head bob, another I Didn't Know? Remember how they sang to us? will this be the end, will this be the last we will see of Phish. Simple answer, no. because when human beings are kind to one another, when human beings share mutual love for one another, when human congregate at special places for strange reasons, phish's legacy will grow, and flourish. and maybe, when the time is right, they will return to us, from their mother ship, and lead us to another place, although i can't imagine a place better than the place they've led me.  Has music ever made you cry? Has a guitar solo ever made you feel like you were being lifeted up onto your feet and carried above all things? Has the voice of a familiar singer never let you down? Has the pounding bass line ever made you slap your wheel so hard that it hurt your hand? Has the sound of the piano meant more to you on the day your grandfather died than your own father's eulogy? Has Jon Fishman's face ever made your day?  if so, you've experienced the power, the strength, and the stability that is Phish  the rock, the foundation, the core, the essence, the School
