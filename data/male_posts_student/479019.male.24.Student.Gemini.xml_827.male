It's sort of a mess that I've gotten myself into and I'm not quite sure how I want to correct it.  Well I got my Amazon orders yesterday. I need to go to campus and buy some books and shot glasses, and also photocopy stuff. I think maybe I'll go ahead and watch  The Majestic  with my lunch and then go.  ***
