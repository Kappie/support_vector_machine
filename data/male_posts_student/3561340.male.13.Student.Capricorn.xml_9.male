Theres no other way to put it. Although the school sucked and so much shit happened, you guys still made it one of the best. All the trouble we got into was definitely worth the punishments. A school without you guys is definitely going to take some time to get used to. Mike and Connor, you guys better win us a championship. Ben, keep the pimpin goin and try not to get expelled. I know thats going to be tough for you. All you naughty Mexicans better not stop talking to me. Enjoy another year at FRANKLIN. haha that sucks.  Kelsey, Jordan, and Lauren- You are probably the only 7th grade girls at Franklin that went through most of the year without hating me. Im sure Ive done or said some mean shit to you guys and I want to apologize for all of it. Stay in touch!   Cody- My role model. Enough said. haha  Shannon, Alissa, Callie, and Morgan- While you all may have hated each other at one point or another, Ive always loved all of you. Dont forget about me  Ali, Kerri, Chelsea, Lindz, Sarah, Jess, MK, and Callie- Wish I met you all earlier. You are all awesome. Stay in touch  Amanda, Kara, Becca- I realize Ive given u reasons to hate me. And although its a bit late, its better than never. I really am sorry.  All the teachers and administrators at Franklin Township School(with a few exceptions)- Some of you thought I was a screw up. All I have to say is that success will be the greatest revenge. So in about 15 years, this "screw up" will have a salary about 10 times what your making.   I cant name any names but there a bunch of you that I hope I never see again. Im not going to waste any more time talkin about you.  Everyone else- Chances are your cool but Im just too lazy to write anything. See you around  Thats it. Peace. Jonny
