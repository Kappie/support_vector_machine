Well I would like to apologize for the last few updates which have been very sketchy, to say the least. You are probably thinking that I must have suddenly lost my marbles to put stuff like this on the net. But you people have to realise that the last few weeks have been very exciting and have caused a churn in my life. It's really something that has changed the way I look at life and the way I approach it. Life doesn't give everybody a second chance. A second attempt to do what I had not done the last time around. A second chance to correct all the mistakes of the past. I am thankful to the Lord Of The Rings  for giving me this chance. I know that the last time I was not wrong. I was a nice guy then and if anything, I am a better person now. I just dont think I am. I know I am. So I am sure that this time I will fare better than last time.  The last time, I had everything within my grasp. I still don't know why I lost it. I don't really want to know. Maybe it was because God wanted me to do it better this time. I am sure that there has been some serious value addition to my profile since last time. I know that this time I am a much better option than I was last time, and that one who rejected me last time, won't have any reason to do so this time. But yes, I also know that nothing is confirmed. Nothing is taken for granted. I don't know what the future holds for me and so I am surely not a bit complacent. But there is a sort of quite calm. The anxiety and the unsecurity that was within me last time, and which I believe was a major reason for my failure last time, is surely not around this time. Instead there is this quiet calm. A sort of silent confidence that this time there is some power behind me which will ensure my success.  Whenever I talk of God, people start rolling their eybrows and start thinking "Okay... here he goes again...." But really, I am so sure that the Lord is with me this time. I talk to him all the time. When I say that to people, they think that I am just saying it for the effect. BUt if fact, I am not talking through my hat. It's just the interpretation of the word God. What I call God, some call conscience, others call it the inner voice. It exists in all of us in some form or other. Some people like me entrust thir entire lives to it, while other just choose to ignore it. So it is this voice, this God, which inspires in me confidence that I am going to crack CAT this year. I am not going to spoil this second shot at success.
