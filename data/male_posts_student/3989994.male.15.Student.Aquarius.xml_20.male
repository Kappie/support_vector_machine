Ok...enough of that made up nonsense, my life by far pales in comparisons compared to what i would write in a book or essay...      So it was a typical day without a *girlfriend* (i am not gay! just in a school that well...). I got back my math test results, and surprisingly, i did not flung! i barely passed though had a miserable 56% compared to the two perfect scorers seating in my group...arghh!!!      And i am also in the running for student's council presidency! The interviews are coming up this monday! I had better start thinking knowing me...      Interviewer:What would you do if you were president?   Me: Errrr... i would like a chicken whooper and hold the fries please   inter: excuse me? I think you got the place wrong!   Me:Arghh..sorry,i am always doing this, so can i get a plain taco instead?   inter:Get out!    Me: Fine way to treat your customers! You'll not be seeing me anytime soon! (stomps out)   inter:Stupid Boy! since when do you burgers or tacos at delifrance?...      Nah, i am not that daft but trust me i can say things that are equally dumb. Ok i am gonna end this entry i have to catch up on my homework which have been undone for the past week! Ithurts to do 9 subjects! I'd drop my second language if i had to though, my teacher looks like as if he had been thoroughly been slapped!
