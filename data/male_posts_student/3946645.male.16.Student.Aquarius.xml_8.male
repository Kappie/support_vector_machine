OMG, at my CIW course, they teach you to use table's for layout...disgusting!! lol  Also the way they write their code is awful...anyway, it's lateish and I don't want to go into that now.  Hmmm, what can I say, nothing special happened this week.  Doom 3 comes out on 3 days, I will buy my special edition then.  I'm also working on a new layout for the Dark Rose site ( urlLink http://www.darkroseweb.tk ). It's not up yet, as I am still working on it, and I want to make sure it looks half decent and it works right before I put it up.  Someone from The Wastelands ( urlLink http://www.thewastelands.2ya.com ) has suggested that I make a Counter-Strike template, so I will. Probably not tonight, or tommorow. Maybe the day after.  I'm a lil hungry now, so I'll go get some food...or starve to death while I play computer games :P :D
