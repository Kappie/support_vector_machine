No, not yet, but I have yet to experience the final few days. To sum this summer holiday up in a sentence:  I went to Majorca and to London and to a wedding and to Amsterdam and to some fringe shows and I got some satisfactory qualifications. There. Who says grammer and punctuation is essential? You understood that, didn't you?  Last night I went to see Marcus Brigstocke at the fringe. What a legend. You know, the guy from that program 'We Are History'. No? Well his website's here:  urlLink www.marcusbrigstocke.com . Oh, and also, when I came back after the show to unlock my bike, someone had nicked my saddle. Typical. You think your bike's safe, locked up in the middle of Edinburgh, at night, in a crowded street, when the festival is on and......oh. I'm stupid. What annoys me is that they didn't even have the sense to use the quick release - they just snapped the mechanism and swiped the seat. Stupid criminals.  Well, tonight I'm going to see Demitri Martin at the fringe. Very kind senor Tom McNeill gave me a ticket - huzzah! Should be good.  I also have started on my personal statement for UCAS. I'll stop there, because it's already getting boring.   Today, I have mostly been playing:  Final Fantasy 7 The Curse of Monkey Island   I have mostly been listening to:  Voices of Violence by Billy Talent River Below by Rilly Talent Back in Black by AC/DC  Well, until my next post, keep it...um...real, i guess. Not that it's possible to stop being real.
