I weasled out of it by promising to go to one on Saturday...  I'm sorry... but I don't like being asked to go somewhere the moment I wake up... especially if they tell me to be ready within the next 30 minutes...  Rei-chan was ova yesterday! ^-^ Almost beat Sonic the hedgehog together... stupid Metropolis crabs... grr...  Uhhhmmmm.... I'm really posting this because I want to see if my blog will show up as one of the ten most recently updated blogs on blogger.com! If it does I'll upload a screenshot.  Demo... what happened to my comment thing-e? Why it gone? *sigh* Meh...  -ArV
