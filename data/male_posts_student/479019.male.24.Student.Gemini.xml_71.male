That resulted in like significantly less than how much I normally sleep. However, I was more awake today in stats than I was on Tuesday. Funny how the body works sometimes.   I'm kind of pissed that Social Science 3A is now somewhat of a real class... research paper!? 3 paragraph proposal due Monday!? Stupid web assignments due Monday!? Damnit! They just had to turn it into a real class by the time I take it.  I need to get myself a copy of Adobe Illustrator to work on my projects for Arts 65b. That should be an easy class...  Hmm... what else do I need to do... oh yea... a 1 page research proposal fo History 192w...  Week 1 and already all these assignments... lovely stuff eh? Could be worse though.  ***
