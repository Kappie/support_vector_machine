Its awesome to see people make blogs and websites, I just went through lots of my old material that i wrote back in 2002 when i was in 6th grade and owned the site. Its amazing to see how people evolve from that point, its awesome. One of my friends from Davis Junior decided to make a blog, that is so cool (http://monicaquire.blogspot.com/), having a blog is like my "motivation" because if it were just in a journal i would never write in it because nobody would read it.
