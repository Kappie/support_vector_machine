Both were going in hard with tackles trying to get the upper hand in midfield as well as creating goals. Many goal oppurtunities were spurned well by the midfielders yet moz of them were squandered by the bungling strikers from both sides. YJC was always the one who took the early one goal lead but could not hld on to it fer long. SP's determination and spirit showed and they came roaring back each time YJC scored.  At the score of 4-3 with YJC leading, SP was desperate as the lines were reshuffled with two holding midfielders introduced to stem YJC's flow of play. The tactic worked miraculously as 2 goals were scored in quick succession. First,was a backhand shot from Gary who received a nice flank pass from the right. It caught the keeper off-guard and went into the bottom corner. FORZA SP was heard evriwhere as the stands cheered. Next,was Rizal, a solid central defender playing as a holding player,who scored a simple tap in from a slide-rule pass from a seemingly tireless Adzmin. Once again,cheers were heard. Everyone was ecstatic as SP was surprisingly in the lead! Amazingly,YJC counter-attacked well and got the lead again through another seemingly harmless defence error. YJC was a brave and courageous team. Overall,both teams did very well. Three cheers for SP n YJC! HIP HIP HOORAY!!!!!    Warning! The reporter for today is high on "tanni". Due to the win,he may have been celebrating at Sultan road over briyani with Carlsberg. Thousand apologies to all concerned.  Exaggeration is purely coincidental and for  amusement. Thank you.
