That class is boring beyond belief. The only upside to it is Casey is in the class, and I know him so I got someone to talk too. I look forward to driving though... just not the classes. I think number one should be shot in his plastic dummy face... put that shrill voice to rest.  Tommorow is my day of rest this week. I know not exactly what I shall do with it, likely hang out with friends, then end back in that horrible class once more. Thursday I work 10 till 2 then spend the evening in karate. My first spare evening should be Friday or Saturday... I wanna break loose and have some fun then.  Least all this busyness is keeping my mind and body occupied. Downside, this busyness is making my mind and body tired and sore. Well, only my feet at sore, but I'm tired. I think all this grocery lifting has done quite a bit for my upper body. It's like a gym - but I get paid to work out, how awesome is that! Course, it could be due to Karate and the past few weeks of intense conditioning I have been doing at home. No conditioning today though... too tired. Too tired. Of course one thing that perks me up... food! Some of that and I can feel the energy flowing through my body.  I'm gonna forage the cupboards for a snack. Peace out.  D
