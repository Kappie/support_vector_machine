The worrying thing is when I got up this morning I felt extremely motivated and that I would work all day until a sizeable chunk of work had been completed, but as soon as I found out I had an extra month the motivation evaporated like cheap perfume.  So now, I find myself casting around for something to do (you do still have work to do twat boy), something that will occupy this lovely Wednesday afternoon. Blogger is an excellent place for this activity.    Sooooooo..............    If I ruled the world:  there would be no stilton  Post boxes would be blue  Cannabis would be compulsory  Everyone would have a 50Mbps Internet connection (for free)  Microsoft would be open source  I would have a doctor who had the time to spend more than five minutes with me (sob)  Mice would be as big as dogs  Dogs would be as big as mice  People wanting cosmetic surgery would have to see a therapist first  There would be no such thing as elective surgery  George Bush would be a small marmoset  I would swap Stephen Fry for Tony Blair and lock-up anybody who didn't agree  :: respite over ::
