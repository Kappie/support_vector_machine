Here are some gems from Ronaldus Magnus:  "Millions of individuals making their own decisions in the marketplace will always allocate resources better than any centralized government planning process."  "America is too great for small dreams."  "There can be no real peace while one American is dying some place in the world for the rest of us.  We are at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars, and it has been said if we lose that war, and in so doing lose this way of freedom of ours, history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its happening.  . . .  If we lose freedom here [in America], there is no place to escape to.  This is the last stand on Earth."  This one hit me hard:  "Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us that they have a utopian solution of peace without victory.  They call their policy 'accommodation.'  And they say if we only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he will forget his evil ways and learn to love us.  . . .  We cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now in slavery behind the Iron Curtain, 'Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skin, we are willing to make a deal with your slave-masters.'" (October 27, 1964)  Anyhow, an interesting site that I plan to read fully.
