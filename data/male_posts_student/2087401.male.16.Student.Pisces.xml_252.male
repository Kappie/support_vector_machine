Anyways, I'm coming to school tomorrow.  I promise.  You'll just have to listen to me cough all day.  lol I guess the only person I'm really talking to right now is Marten since he's the only one who I see regularly throughout the day.  I suppose I do see Erin in the mornings, though, and Thomas sometimes, too.  So I am talking to them as well.  Okay, sorry, I'm gonna go sleep...cya.  Does my sexiness offend you?
