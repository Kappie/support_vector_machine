I have no idea what turnout was, 40 or so maybe, i think? who knows. 2004 is shaping up to be a great year, starting out with a kiss from my sweetie, great beginning. R. and I were the prettiest girls on the street, though A.'s dress was amazing and her shoes...all i have to say is dangerous(in the best sense of the word) She brought a couple of cats that i knew from Art's High, had not seen them since graduation...seriously this world is just getting smaller. Had brunch at the T-rock than yesterday, great time, ran into a couple of people i know. That F, and M. and Hall helped me clean the post party mess up...thanks you guys, really appreciate it.  sledding tonight at J's and i am fully intending to flask it. decided against resolutions this year...though i do have goals 1. really put an effort in to quitting smoking  by r's birthday, since the two of are are both quitting i am hoping it should be easier. 2. keep up with school 3. budget budget budget I am tempted to add more to the list but that would just set me up for failure Happy New Years Everyone cheers devin
