When career services starts their onslaught in October or November, it's a pain to find the time and energy to do it then, so you may as well do it now.  Leave some room at the top for Law School stuff, but get everything else up to date, less than a page long, lots of white space, no typos... no big deal, but you'll be happy come November that you got a head start.
