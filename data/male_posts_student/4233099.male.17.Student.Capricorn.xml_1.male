The past few weeks, I've been thinking hard, going into professional theatre, wondering if this is really what I want. I've always known that College is a time where you figure out what you want by trying, which should seem like a positive thing right? I guess the reason I was so down about the whole thing, well, I was more concerned about keeping up with my friends in what they're doing. I suppose that's almost a twisted dependency. I just had the feeling that I didn't want to be left behind, but this isn't high school anymore. It's not about the class anymore, it's about the individual student.  The orientation wasn't anything worth dreading. In fact it was kinda fun, but I suppose it adds to the experience when you're hanging out with a friend as we make obnoxious jokes about the Dean and our creepy as hell tour guide! Me and Nachaj did the whole campus tour scene, got our student ID's and such. Good on Nachaj for pulling out his best "Gonna Rape Ya!" smile for his ID photo. Quite the load of people I ran into today also; James Cotnoir in the hallways. Christie at the pool as expected. Ran into Sonie, who introduced me to her boyfriend Vince. More Hudson kids in Vicki Pasaliqui, Paul Solnoky, Mike Doble, Ryan Ramage, Adam Buckman, all there as well. Ooh, The Zgeb was there too. He had a hawk. I miss my hawk:(.  Man, our agenda's such a whore. 270 pages and 170 of those pages are ad space. Oh well, tons of Subway coupons. Hey Myles, if I give you my coupons, can we call it even? Haha, don't worry, you'll get your 6 bucks.  I can't believe I did this, but I actually a club! No issue with clubs, just didn't expect to join one is all. I ended up signing up for Radio, which gets played through the campus or something. Expect my hour and a half to be filled with mucho Green Day. My fans will approve(yeah, both of them).  Kim and I will be splitting a locker this year, and we really lucked out with lockers right by the pool. By the way, all those who want to go through Kim's things, I'm selling our combo for a reasonable price;).  Haha, Absolutely Not.  The video for American Idiot played. I strongly approve. 32 Days.
