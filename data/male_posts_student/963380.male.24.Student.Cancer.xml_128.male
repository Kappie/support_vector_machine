This really will mostly be a jumble of my most irrational emotions framed in some rather dioramic scenes.  I've had a lovely time riding my bikes , both motor and pedal over the past few days. I guess getting in shape can be fun, as well as popping small wheelies (honestly, I didn't know cruisers could pop wheelies, outside of videogames. it was cool). There is an interconnecting set of trails interspersed all through the tri-city area. It's kind of Prince of Tides-ish, that section where his brother goes nuts/urban commando and starts blowing shit up. I'll now wallow in the shame of having read a Pat Conroy novel. At least I haven't watched the film.  Work has been a series of love hate relationships - I saw Mary Stevens today - the lady that was going to offer me a job but never emailed me back. I suffered a brief moment where I wanted to take her walker from her and beat her senseless. It passed. Barely.  I ran the floor today for a little while. By little while I mean "ENTIRE FUCKING DAY". It was painful. I've been yelled at in my time, but this takes the cake. I was even yelled at by a deaf lady who wrote her yelling out on paper. Yeah, terminal papercut to the throat indeed.  I'm having a tough time with Glennis. It's seriously a Love/Hate relationship. I love to hate him, but occassionally he's a human being. He really knows how to demean people, were I made of weaker stuff, I'd probably end up a blubbering mass of tears at his emotional onslaughts. Instead I end up mostly incensed at his utter lack of and his occassional abuse of tact.  I loathe the fact that I'm not nearly the person my parents are. Perhaps it's something that comes with age or experience or with breathing British air. I really don't measure up when you think about it - both my mom and my dad grew up in environments that were hostile to say the least. My mother grew up in an environment that was slightly less friendly than an Iraqi minefield; the stories you see told of the Irish, in books and in films, these stories are not exagerations or fancies of creative minds. My mother grew up in a hell on earth that explains, to a degree her behaviour towards me over my entire life. It saddens me that I'm not more like them.
