Well, something happened out of the blue today - I conducted a 40-person survey for the first time in my life.  STOP! You can keep the medal for yourself, thank you very much. It was no great feat. But the start was incredibly difficult. Imagine people just walking past you, thinking that every step you take towards them your aura will pull them towards the Dark Side...   Of course excuses start flooding with their saliva in their mouths. "Busy..." some mutter from the corner of their lips. Some just smile and say "Thanks" when they should have taken the form and giving me the chance to reply. But most prefer to blend into the crowd, knowing that they have absolutely no chance of lowering their conspicuity whatsoever.  Doing surveys at fast-food restaurants is a great idea (of course, if you are lucky enough not to get chased out for doing the same to their customers). Firstly, those people can't possibly run away since they are either waiting for or enjoying their meal.  Secondly, the air conditioner in the restaurant seem to keep the temperature - and their tempers - cool so they don't spit and shout at the poor survey conductor. Believe me, scenarios like the abovementioned become much more common at food centres where the fans are negligible and cigarette smoke gives people adrenaline rushes.  So, I managed to complete the survey drool-free. Then I proceeded to Ling Yi's house, where Hun Ning and I did some pre-class preparations for Sci-Fi and Fantasy elective.  Yeah, you guessed it. We watched Star Wars Episode V and VI. Han Solo is the man, and C-3PO... should be murdered. Then again, droids are usually irritating.
