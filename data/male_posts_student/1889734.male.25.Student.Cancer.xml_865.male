Stepping gingerly into another social issue, Kerry reiterated that he believes that life begins at conception - and that a woman has the right to choose whether to abort.     So conception means life, but killing it is just fine with Kerry.  And before anyone pops a cork here, I happen to be an Atheist, and I don't really have any strong feelings about abortion.  But I think Kerry should at least be consistent here!  You can't have it both ways.  Wait, he tries to offer a further explanation.   "I don't believe personally that it's the government's job to step in and take my article of faith and transfer it to somebody who doesn't share that article of faith," said Kerry, a Roman Catholic.   I wonder...is 'Thou Shall Not Murder' transferable?  If life begins at conception, John, then what is an abortion?  Or is infanticide just fine with you?    But then we get into viability.     Asked whether he believes abortion is taking a life, Kerry said a fetus is a "form of life."  "The Bible itself - I mean, everything talks about different layers of development. That's what Roe v Wade does. It talks about viability. It's the law of the land." The Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v Wade ruling legalized abortion in America.   So if it is simply a measure of viability, then can you give me a moral argument against euthanasia of the elderly?  Removal of life support against the will of the patient?  Severely handicapped?  How about 'aborting' a two year old by just withholding food?  Where's the line?  And while we are on the subject of killing, where's Kerry on the Death Penalty?   Kerry has long been an opponent of the death penalty, but in recent years has made an exception for terrorism. The former prosecutor said crimes like rape and child murder do not warrant the highest punishment.  "It's certainly terrorizing to the person who's undergoing it. I understand that," Kerry said. "But terrorism is a political act to terrorize a nation, to try to challenge a way of life and a standard.. It's just a different act."   Ah, so killing a child isn't as bad as 'challenging a way of life'.
