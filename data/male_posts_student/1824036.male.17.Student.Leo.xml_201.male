I am at work with Person "A", and Person "B". "B" brings 2 of his friends (we'll call them "C"). One of them just so happened to be "A"'s little brother. "A" knew the 2 friends wanted beer, so he took it inside with me. While we put it away the group of 3 outside lit stuff on fire with the lighters, quite mature.  Then "B" and "C" went to put crap in the truck. Some other people pulled out behind the store. "A" got in his vehicle and I knew he was gonna kick some butt if the people didn't leave, so I went with. After "A" threatened to kick some butt, the people left. "A" called some authoratative people and got "C" (the friends) to leave. Then we finally got to doing some real work... at about 1 A.M. ... oh yeah, did I mention that one of the two "C"s also work at the store.  We hauled crap all over in the store. We have too many  urlLink Cheerios . I dont know why they ordered so much. We also have a lot of old orchard juice crap. I got the privelage of climbing all over on top of the coolers and freezers to stack crap on top of them...that wasn't too bad. Kinda entertaining at about 5 AM.  After we were done with the majority of what we could have gotten done, I took a pallet jack around back (it had lots of boxes on it). As I was walking in the side door (that needs to be propped open or you get locked out) the  urlLink Hy-Vee  truck driver asks to get through. I move my pallet jack out from the door way to the outside. The F'ing arse kicks my door prop off the door and slams it shut. I was pissed. I had to wait for someone to come open the door. Then it took us almost 20 min to crush all the boxes we had...  I have a new respect/hate for  urlLink Hy-Vee ...
