Even in a virtual void such as Egypt people manage to convey them with their words and actions, a testament to empathy and the human spirit if there was ever.  So I will let an exchange I had this afternoon with a child of 3 carry me untill the next, knowing in this world I am not alone.   Sunday!!  My pick-up hockey day and after 12 years (minus a hiatus or two) it never tires to hear them boys bicker.  Raland thinks forward to next week and smiles.  Ok the Lakers are being pushed to brink on this night. (oversight) Go Pistons!!
