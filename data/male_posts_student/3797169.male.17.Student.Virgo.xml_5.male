But you gotta understand. Takin' a rust heap to show stopper status aint playin with ABC blocks you know? It's hard work cuttin apart a car, especially a unibody that's got more rust than the RMS Titanic.      I'll see if I can't get you down to Pick Your Part or Memory Lane...then you'll see. There's lots to be had, but it's hard to get done.      In junkyards, cars are cheaps.   And what you find you keeps?   You pay for, then you keeps.   And if it's gutless, they're real cheaps.   So you likes?   You keeps.
