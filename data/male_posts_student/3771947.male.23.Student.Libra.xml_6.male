I am begining to like some of the guys and have already earned most of their respect. The army is more laid back, the Marine anal attitude was beginning to get to me.   I saw Colin from Mayfair, with a bunch of the other guys who worked there.He has yet to go to boot camp and kind of looks up to me as the only Corporal in the unit. It was funny to see him, he has a lot to learn. We had classes on call for fire, the 50 Cal machine gun, and the M19 automatic grenade launcher; we then proceeded to roll up HUNDREDS of cami nets, and that was drill. Tomorrow is the picnic, HOOAH.   Marko called today, he is leaving for Georgia on Monday. Tomorrow he is going to drive down and we are going to say our goodbyes. He was one of my best friends when we were bothstationed at Camp Lejuene, both young salty Lance Corporals. When I left Echo two months ago he was 1st Platoon 1st Squad leader and I was 3rd Platoon 1st Squad leader.   We had some wild times, Marko and I: Myrtle, Charleston, DC, Harrisburg, ECU, and Chapel Hill. He was the one who introduced me to a lot of the "finer" things in life. I was with Marko on my first trip to DC, when I bought my first pair of diesels, and when I smoked my first cigar. He taught me a lot about life andhas such a interesting outlook on everything. His stories of Europe were my reason for going. I can't wait to see his arrogantself again. We are going to catch up over beers, steaks,and cigars at the Brew Works after the Army picnic.   Well, now my father and I are going to finish the bathroom. It is so nice to have it back!
