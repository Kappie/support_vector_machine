Wish me all the best for Bio? HaHa!  Okay...today I went with Mother to buy my brother's remaining school textbooks. As expected, I was mistaken for an Evgian by the bookshop vendor. You know, I was expecting myself to be 'caught' by the principal for not wearing school u. I prepared a speech you know "With all due respect, I am not from Evergreen. Not everyone who steps into the front gate is an EVGian you know." Too bad I don't have to the chance to use it. Such a pity.  Hmm...I went to eat lunch at Woodlands Central. Sigh! Today was so dissappointing. the stall which makes fabulous laksa moved away, and today the dessert stall didn't open. Sigh!!!!   Oh yes. They brought the PS2 to be 'fixed'. It cannot play PS1 games (which was supposed to). The uncle told us that we need some special procedure, like swtich off and switch on, press reset button twice. Something like that la. And they brought a driving wheel, complete with pedals back. It was for racing purposes la. O.O!! I tried it....it's better in some ways. Ha! I make a lousy driver.   Hmm...ya know. I've been playing Makin Magic for quite some time now. I must say...it's quite fun! I learnt like 3-4 spells? Oh yeah! HaHa! I've been having fun. I need to improve a lot on my Sim's skills to earn MagiCoins ar, to become a superstar ar. Woah! So taxing wor! But so fun! I like it! And the music too! Wooooooo.......  Oh! You wanna know the result of Wendy's choice yesterday? It was a tough call, but due to a bit of luck here and there, Aaron Carter won! What a close shave!  Hmm...I gotta be going to watch Charmed. Sand Francsico's Dreaming tonight! Arlighty then. See ya tomorrow after the Bio exam. Night blog!
