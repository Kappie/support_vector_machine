Jesus christ did that movie look like a vortex of shit or WHAT. Of course that doesn't stop E-Talk Daily from trying to hype it.  Just before it was released the local entertainment news show tried to make people see it by showing clips from an interview spread over a few days. I think they split the interview into parts so that the intended target audience, who wouldn't remember anything past two hours before the show itself, would fail to realize that all the interview consisted of was Halle and one of the absolute worst human beings I have ever seen on TV talking about that goddamn whip and her leather outfit. I think whoever wrote the questions for the interview must have drank a gallon of LSD then scribbled down any question which might be interpreted as something related to cats. Here's the gist of it:    Awful man : DID YOU GET HURT WHILE USING THE   WHIP  ? I BET YOU TOOK A LOT OF CATNAPS ON SET EH! THAT  BLACK LEATHER  SURE WAS  SKIMPY , YOU CERTAINLY ARE A ROLE MODEL FOR ACTRESSES ALL OVER!!   Halle : YEAH FILMING WAS REALLY THE  CAT 'S MEOW!   AM : IF YOU REALLY HAD NINE LIVES, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN YOUR NEXT ONE?   H : EAT LOTS OF  CATNIP  LOL   AM : HEY WHEN YOU WERE USING THE WHIP DID YOU EVER FEEL SEXIER?   H : OH WELL I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT ON TELEVISION!   AM : WHAT'S THE MATTER?  CAT  GOT YOUR TONGUE?!   H : OH YOU CARD! THAT WAS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED!   Me : GIVE ME CANCER NOW   Sorry to use caps but it's really necessary to show how fake the interview sounds. I think what E-Talk Daily did was just replace every word above with something similar in the thesarus, then play it on TV the next day and pass it off as a different interview. The only reason I sit through that shitheap of a show once in a while is to remind myself of why guns were invented.  That, and I really hate how everyone is like OMG HALLE BERRY IS SUCH A LEADER AND SHE'S A GOOD ROLE MODEL and shits their pants when there's nothing really special about her.  PS: whip
