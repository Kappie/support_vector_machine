But it's a common occurance nowadays and I'm sure all of us know somebody who has divorced. So, what's are the most common reasons?  We're not in love anymore. We're too different. The other person won't change.  Okay, response one. Um, you are never in love. That euphoric feeling you have when you first date somebody is called Limerance and usually lasts anywhere from a few months to 2 years. So what happens after that? You CHOOSE to continue loving that person. So that's not an excuse. (See the book  The Five Love Languages  by Gary Chapman)  Response two. Too different? Why didn't you think about that before you got married? I'll tell you why, you were in Limerance and were blind to/ignored your mate's many 'flaws'.  Response three. Other person won't change. Although this is actually can be true *rarely*, in most cases this is an indication that you are the person unwilling to change. If you are honest with yourself, anyway.  Any other reason is most often connected to the above three, unless it has to do with physical abuse, but that is another matter entirely.  The solution? Don't get married while you're 'in Love'. Be a bit more patient to make sure you know enough about yourself and your partner. This is very big decision to make.  Don't believe me? Ask any divorcee and the legal proceedings that are a part of divorce.  That old adage,  Patience is a virtue , is true...
