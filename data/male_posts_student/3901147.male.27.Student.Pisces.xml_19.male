I'll use this site to post up some everyday pics of what goes on in the life of the "Littles."  After mowing the yard in the heat of midmorning I thought I would take a break and prepare to go watch Spidey 2.  Nothing like going to watch a movie by yourself when everyone else is out working.  I'll post a small pic of Betsy and I starting our vacation in St. Louis on July 2nd at the Double Tree hotel.  I must say these damned cookies are positively sinful!  Best cookie I have had in my life hands down!  Hmmmm considering I know nill about html as I find it boring I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out how to add a picture to the post.  This should be a fun afternoon.  Rob
