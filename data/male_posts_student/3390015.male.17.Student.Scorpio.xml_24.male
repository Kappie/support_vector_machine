Anyway, picked up some great books for cheap at this new overstock remainder type bookstore downtown, it's a great place. Here's what I got:  1. Jurassic Park - now I already have this, but there is this special large paperback matte cover edition that I just had to have, because it doesn't wear out after multiple reads or rough handling -- I have one other like it, Sphere.  2. Schindler's List - it looked cool and it was a similar edition to the one above, so why not? It's the novel.  3. Poems by C.S. Lewis - these poems look awesome.  4. LOTR - Fellowship of the Ring - this is an interesting story, I have the hobbit, the two towers, and the return of the king all in this special edition with the same covers and everything, but I never had the first of the trilogy, and now I've completed the collection!!   Now back to typing, I'm halfway done...but I'll have to do extensive revising over the next few days or week. Oh well, it's part of the game...  I'm kind of zoned out right now, I don't know why...
