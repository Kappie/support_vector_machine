I am a little disappointed that Danny chose to post essentially what is a Michael Moore screed from Stupid White Men.  If you look point for point, it bears a striking semblance to  urlLink this .  But Danny did say he was posting 'talking points', so it isn't like he was passing off some other work as his own.  In the future, I'm looking forward to hearing HIS views, especially when we start to dissect them on the cold table of logic.    Just to re-iterate for Danny's benefit - I haven't been too happy with Bush.  I'm more of a conservative than a Republican, and if it wasn't for the War on Terror (WOT in this forum), I'd be sitting out this election.  Bush hasn't earned my vote on the domestic side, even though the tax cuts were a big help.  Bush isn't my horse, and aside from WOT, I wouldn't be all that upset to see him lose.    But the WOT is real, so I'll do what I can to get him re-elected (or elected for the first time if you prefer...sigh).  Let's stipulate for a moment about the criminal charges made here.  Let me grant you in theory that all of this is true and ask you a follow up question.  Why does it matter to Danny?  I'm not saying it is not relevant...I just want to know specifically why it might anger you.  I want to know what you think about it, and why.  You might certainly question the man's judgment for covering up a checkered past, but I find it amusing that you defend Gore for the pot admission, when I very much doubt there was a problem with "I didn't inhale".  Truth be told, that didn't really bother me about Clinton, beyond it being a laughable excuse.  I'd just like to know where you are coming from on this issue.  Then I'll be glad to discuss specifics.  Now for the funding cuts.  I'm reading your list of 'cuts' and I'm getting excited.  Oh how I wish they went even deeper.  But for the sake of argument, let's take one at random and run it through the Google Machine.  "Cut $700 million dollars in funds for public housing repairs."  Well, according to the  urlLink Council of Large Public Housing Authorities , it's even 'worse' then you say.   Eight and a half months after President Bush released his Federal budget blueprint, which proposed cutting the Public Housing Capital Fund by $800 million and eliminating the $310 million Public Housing Drug Elimination Grant program, Congress finally passed a HUD budget that will result in a funding reduction for all public housing of approximately 3% from last years' amounts. On November 6, the VA-HUD Conference Committee agreed to the Conference Report on the FY 2002 VA-HUD Appropriations. The House overwhelmingly passed the bill, 401-18, on Thursday, November 8, 2001. That same day, the Senate passed the measure, 87-7.     Wow, so it was $800 million, and it passed the House and Senate by a nail biting 383 and 80 votes respectfully.  Damn Republicans!  But then we read on...    While the bill is an improvement over the original HUD request for public housing, it still leaves agencies and their residents woefully shortchanged. The Conference Committee rejected the President's proposed dramatic cuts to the Public Housing Capital Fund and appropriated $550 million more than the President requested, however, the result is a $ 150 million reduction over last years' level.    So looks like they got a big chunk of the money back later.  Too bad.  So the real problem isn't that Bush tried to cut the budget...it's that he FAILED to cut the budget.  I'm upset with him over that.  I want REAL cuts in all of these programs.  But I still think it is unfair to criticize Bush for cuts that never happened, or at least do the research to see how the Congress voted on each proposed cut.  As I'm sure you know, Congress spends the money...the President just suggests how to spend it.  Try it out.  Pick a random 'cut' and start looking into it.  It's like a party game.  Take a drink when you find hypocrisy.  Philosophically though, I'd like Danny to explain how any of these programs are legally the mandate of the Federal Government.  Where does the government draw the authority to spend money on advanced pediatric training for doctors?  Or why does the Government feel it has the mandate to fund libraries (some day we will talk about libraries in great detail, and many will rue the day).  This cuts at the heart of political philosophy, and I'd like to hear the new guy's perspective on why the government should fund these things.  And lets talk about glorious Kyoto.  According to this  urlLink CBS News  story...    It will be the first such vote since the Senate voted 95-0 in 1997 to reject many of the principles behind an international climate treaty negotiated in Kyoto, Japan. The treaty was signed later that year by then-Vice President Al Gore but the Senate never ratified it.     So Clinton's failure to get the Senate to ratify a treaty (95-0...damn Republicans), becomes Bush's failure to implement the provisions?  Actually, even if the vote was 50-50 with Dick Cheney casting the tie breaker while rubbing a bust of Machiavelli, I would still be pleased  that this thing was killed.    But shove that aside for a moment and let's talk about the specifics of Kyoto.  Kyoto is not the ultimate solution to CO2 emissions.  There are other ways of doing it, and most of them are market driven.  The major flaw in Kyoto is the exemptions offered to developing countries, which routinely employ less efficient technologies for energy production, resulting in a high per capita emission.  By exemption developing countries for the foreseeable future, Kyoto ignores what will be a massive contribution to the CO2 levels over the coming decades.  The economic costs imposed upon the developed world, such as the US, is not an acceptable solution in light of these exemptions.  If a true environmentalist wants to see a reduction in gas, he should support the development of nuclear power, but somehow I don't think that's going to fly.  In the mean time, signing on to a treaty of dubious value, and accepting the resulting economic impact, isn't a sane thing to do.  There are other ways,   Take a look at this  urlLink DOE study  on carbon emission in the US.  The graph is particularly interesting.    As discussed below, factors such as a drop in carbon intensity in the electric power sector kept emissions growth in 2002 to less than the average annual growth rate since 1990...  Between 1990 and 2002, U.S. economic growth averaged 2.9 percent per year. Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, however, grew by an average of 1.2 percent annually.     We are getting more efficient at power production, and we are doing it without Kyoto.  Imagine that....Go on, read the whole report and let's dissect it.  Finally, I have to go back to a  urlLink Michael Moore  criticism that struck me as amusing.    Pushed for development of "mini-nukes," designed to attack deeply buried targets-a violation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty    Well, if you go look at the  urlLink Treaty  web site and do some poking around, you'll find the following - (And I can't link directly to it because it is some sort of Java thing.  You can find it on your own, it's easy.)     State Information United States of America  Annex 2 State* Yes  Signature Date 24-SEP-1996  Ratification Date Not Ratified      Hmmm....we should honor a treaty that isn't ratified?  Between the Test Ban and Kyoto, it seems Bush's biggest crime is honoring the Congressional power to ratify treaties.  Damn Bush for following the Constitution.  See, the  urlLink Senate  voted down the treaty in 1999, by a 51-49 vote (okay, now you can say Damn Republicans).  So it has no force of law.  Why should we restrict ourselves to something that has no legal standing?  Oh yeah, it's kind of like the 'unilateral' argument with the UN, isn't it?  So, in the words of a great man...Bring it on!
