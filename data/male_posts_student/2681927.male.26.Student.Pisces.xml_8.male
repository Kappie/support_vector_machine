Or as the prime minister Goran Persson said,  "A public sector and high taxes, appropriately used, can be a driving force for economic development. We show that here in Sweden" (my translation). In sum, a normal May Day in Sweden. But as the paper Tyler Cowen at Marginal Evolution  urlLink pointed to  the other day shows, any sort of bragging from Goran Persson's side is misplaced. The swedish welfare system does not work today and if he wan't it work tomorrow he have to make sure that new jobs gets created. And that won't probably happen with the taxes we have today.
