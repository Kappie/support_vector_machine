My back aches and I'm pretty sure I did something bad to my right thumb.  Right by the joint, on the inside of my hand is a bruise.  The pain, I can handle.  The only thing I’m worried about is doing something really bad to it.  I was thinking about taping it, but then again, what is there to tape?  I don’t feel like talking about it anymore.  If I do, I’ll just feel like I’m complaining.  Had a scrimmage today against the freshmen, instead of football practice.  According to all of the coaches we did horrible.  I can’t say I disagree, but I don’t think we did horrible.  We did crappy.  I don’t know what the difference is really, but yeah.  I’m tired.  Good night.
