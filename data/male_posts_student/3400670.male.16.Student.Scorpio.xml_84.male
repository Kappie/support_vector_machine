I think if people think they are responsible to have sex, then they should be responsible enough to use protection. I know condoms aren't always 100% effective and sometimes little sperm-ies get out, but if you are responsible enough to have sex, you have to be responsible enough to deal with the consequences, whatever they might be. I think some people use abortion and the morning after pill as a form of birth control after they have had sex, rather then using birth control before or during. If you aren't ready to have kids, then you aren't ready for sex. I think if people weren't so caught up on acting older then they are, we wouldn’t have to have this talk about whether abortion should be legal or not, because there wouldn’t be a high number of unwanted pregnancies.
