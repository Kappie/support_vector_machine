We also went out this evening, we didn't do much, just sit around chatting on Meadow Road park.   Ryan's Rollercoaster Tycoon game came - but it wasn't what we ordered!  Poor Ryan, they had accidently sent him "Dora the Explorer - Backpack Adventure" LOLOL!  Aparantly we can't get a themed suite at Alton Towers until the 27th August, but Grandma and Grandad are going to keep trying to get us one.  Going Blackpool Pleasure Beach soon!  Dad's taking us... can't wait!
