That's right folks, California is considering Open Source! Although the proposal for Open Source comes primarily out of a desperate need for money, it's a good first step that may someday challenge the Microsoft Hegemony. Of course, I'm not one to mention irony of the Governator trying to destroy the mindless, robotic killers driven by Sky...err Dot Net...  One has to wonder though: What will happen to Microsoft if it someday loses power? With 50 billion dollars in reserve, how can Microsoft even fall? An image of Bill Gates springs into my mind, resting peacefully in his office when suddenly a bright red light starts flashing, sirens blare, and Gates makes the call to Ballmer to press that magical red button that will immediately channel funds to key parts of the company. Will I respect Microsoft less than SCO then? Will they stop producing those phenomenal keyboards and mice? What will happen to Halo (*shiver*...life without halo)? Will Steven Jobs immediately cease to exist, the only goal binding him to existence in the mortal realm gone? No matter what, I think it'd be worth it just to see the face of Bill Gates as he sees his immoral ways, etched forever into the annals of history. March forth Linux! To quote Eric S. Raymond, Open Source Advocate,  "The sinister plan for world domination is right on schedule".  May the source be with you!
