Weird, has tendency to wrestle with me, bro, and mom. Likes to keep fish. Once, his fish died, he cooked it and ate it himself. Used to keep birds. Fed panadol to one of his sick birds before and it died the next day. Thankfully, he doesnt keep birds anymore. I'll usually get shock when i see a dead bird in the dustbin. At least he flushes dead fish in toilet bowls, so no more shocks.    2)MOM:    Race: Chinese, Malay   Loving. Born a chinese but raised as a malay. Cannot speak chinese but can speak malay and a bit of english. Chinese name= Lee Yoke Chun. Likes to wrestle with me, bro and dad too. Used to be a WWE fanatic. Likes to bury her fallen hairs into any plot of soil that can be found, as she believe that it will cause her hair to "grow back". Somewhat retarded.    3)SISTER    Very noisy but cool. Kinda like the typical minah. High-pitched voice and stuff. Used to listen to Metallica, now a bollywood fanatic. Always askin whether she's fat. Gettin married next month (YAY!). Has on obsession in playin THE SIMS. Once, she sneaked into my room while i was sleepin to play the game.    4) BROTHER    Big NERD. Currently studyin for A levels. Every weekend, he'll probably study till 4am. [im sittin for my o levels this year yet i don't give a fuck!] Introduced guitarin to me. Can't play football, can't skate, only can study and play  kompang  [malay traditional musical instrument, usually played durin weddings] Kinda like the "good boy" in the family.    5)LIL SIS    Very noisy also. Kinda bitchy, and rude. Has attitude problem and is rather weak in studies. [she thinks wake up is a word/ eg  "wake up me at 7am" ] Spends most of her time watchin television. Thinks Avril Lavigne is cool. [YUCKS!]      Well, thats bout it. My family. As weird as it may sounds, they're still my family. Bleah, peace out.
