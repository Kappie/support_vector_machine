It was Mamanasta's birthay yesterday, but the b-day bash is not over yet. The v8 is with me, and I'll transfer it to CD, then TJ will edit it with his windows movie maker.  ARGH!!! I'M NOT IN THE MOOD TO BLOG!!!! RICO SAAN MO BA NAKUKUHA YUNG MGA NASA BLOG MO!!!!!  oh, i remember. the debut did not turn out as bad as I thought, and now I knew why jiguli once used the penname 'cereal killer'  ok, that's what's left in my head
