On the way to church I heard this really great song that I felt begins to describe how I feel. If you feel offended, don't be, it's probably not directed towards you. The people that it is directed towards probably won't take the hint anyways.. the song is by Clay Aiken, and it's called "Invisible". The part that sticks out the most from that song goes as follows:  "I wish I was invisible Wait, I already am..."  Sometimes I feel as if I rely too much on my friends too much, and the ones I count on the most usually seem to let me down. Maybe it is all in my head.. I could try to explain this more in depth, but, again, I don't want to offend anyone.  Sorry If I already have.. I don't mean to.   Well, I've been catching up on the music I haven't been listening to in the past while.. another song that partially describes my mood is by Stacie Orrico. The title is "(There's Gotta Be) More to Life" Call me a pop music junkie and you would be correct.. hehe  "I've got it all but I feel so deprived I go up, I come down, and I'm emptier inside Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing And Why can't I let it go??  There's gotta be more to life...  Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me  Cause the more that I'm...  Tripping out thinking there must be more to life  Well it's life, but I'm sure... there's gotta be more  Than wanting more"  You may have noticed I have not been on AOL instant messenger for a while, and when I do, it is in very small amounts. This is because when I AM on only 2 people talk to me. It bothers me when I try to greet people online only to get a "Hey" response and then silence for the next 10, 15 minutes, until they say something really unimportant and stupid. Therefore, I have decided that is is a much more efficient use of my time to go do something else rather than sit here and wait for people to respond. Nobody probably noticed anyways..  On a side note, my trombone jury is tomorrow. I will show Brian up again, as usual, even though he probably deserves first chair a little more than I do. Oh well. That's the way the cookie crumbles.  At first, I was excited to be in Ski Club this year, but now there is no ski club, and finally there is snow.. I think the passion has died out.. somebody help me with this one. I dunno why I feel this way.   My mom is at home for six weeks because she broke her arm the night before Thanksgiving. That is the reason I was in Rochester all of Thanksgiving Break.. time mainly spent in the hospital with my mom.. she had to have surgery on her arm. They put in some metal screws and plates and stuff. I'm sure it'll be fun when she tries to board an airplane... Sigh... I told Alexi I was going to watch Donnie Darko tonight.. but I did not have time.. too much time spent practicing my trombone.. I'll watch it tomorrow and return it to him on Friday I guess. I got paid today.. but I fear it was a moot point because my parents are now making me buy new tires for my car. Damn.  Wow.. I wrote that top portion about five minutes ago. I guess I fell asleep in my chair again.. I'm off to bed. I wonder if anyone reads my blog. If you do, tell me, I am interested to see who reads this thing. I remember when I had a hit counter that I was pretty much the only one making the numbers go up.  I talk too much. Bye.
