It is quite annoying that I can do that before he even explains it.  There was a rally today, so we got out of Math five minutes early. My English teacher tried to get me to go again. I didn't, if I wanted to waste my time, I would just stand around and do nothing.   During English we watched a movie almost the whole time. Boring stuff. It was about the Salem Witch Trials, since we are reading  The Crucible . I was thinking about asking him if I could go to the bathroom and then going to see if the TAs needed any help. I didn't though. I sat there and "slept". Then at the end he kind of talked about it. I pretty much just zoned out.  During lunch I had a leadership meeting for Christian Club. We talked about who was speaking next week and for how long and what the subject was. Anyways, that was pretty much all we did, then we talked about nothing in particular for the remainder.  During my free period I helped out with the TA. She is pretty nice, and she likes GameBoy! Anyways, it was interesting, and I had fun messing around. She just played GameBoy the whole time.  During Biology I must not have been paying complete and utter attention. It went by to fast for that.  I had piano lessons after school, and those went okay. I have another song to play. I am singing a hymn or something. I am also playing "I can only imagine" 'cause I played it for her and she liked it so much.  Well, I will be going, talk to you all later. Remember to look both ways before you cross the street.
