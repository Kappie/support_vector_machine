He claims to be a yellow alien with a green anal probe stick.    For some strange reason, he appears in episode 9 from the 7th season of  urlLink The Simpsons .  At one point, the army is checking every room in some base, and at one point they open one door, and a little yellow alien (with the stereotypical grey-style eyes and looks) with a glowing green probe stick. (...just like jark!)  As the door opens and the soldiers notice the alien, the alien turns to the light coming from the door, with an angry face and holding the green probe stick, and a guy shouts something like "Oh no, he's got the probe!" and they quickly close the door.
