THis is probably going to be my last post for awhile, considering the fact I'm leaving tomorrow after church for West Virginia (mountain mama, take me home, country road...-yeah, I know that song). Anyways, I'll be back on saturday, the 19th. So...asta-levesta for now...or how ever you spell it. Wait, I'm not leaving yet. How about I save the goodbyes for the end?  For now, more stuff on the story...  The girls name is...(drum roll)...wait. I'll figure that out later. Lets see. Alot of this is just vision after vision that you can't exactly trace onto paper. Not now anyway.   I think there will be alot more time travel, and even wrping, than I thought there would be. I hope to have alot done when I get back.  I have to run. So...asta-levesta baby...
