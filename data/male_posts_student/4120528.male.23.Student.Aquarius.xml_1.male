It didnt hurt much at the time.  But today it is as sore as hell.  So that sucks.  I have alot of mixed feeling right now.  Pretty much the only person I can talk to is having a really hard time dealing with a Ex.  While I am having simaliar problems.  Although I do have feelings for this person I cant come out and say it.  Either besauce I am affraid or I think that she doesnt need me adding to her pile of stuff going on.  Which she really doesnt need.  I thinkt that is more why I dont say anything becasue I dont want to add to what is going on.  I just wish I could help more.  She had a really bad day where the ex called and in a long form called her a whore.  Which is the farthest from the truth.  Sometimes I really dont understand how a guy can be such an asshole.  I know being a guy sometimes being an asshole is necisary but this time I really just want to punch this guy out and ask WTF was he thinking?  I dont know I think I need to do something or I am going to think about this too much today.
