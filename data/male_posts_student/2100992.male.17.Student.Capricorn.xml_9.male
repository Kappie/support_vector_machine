I am pissed that Calgary lost, but I am very happy about what Jerome Iginla did. With like a minute left he fought Darien Hatcher! and not only that, as they were going down, he DRILLED him a nice hard shot right to the face. In the words of Don Cherry "hes a good guy." Seriously, this guy defines the word captain. He scores goals, sets up his team mates, plays physical and gives 100% every shift, and he even fights now to set the tone for his team and and the series. Even though I am Maple Leaf blue through and through, this guy is a beast and I think he is the MVP of the year.   The San Jose Sharks also defeated the Colorado Avalanche today to take a 2-0 series lead, and Patrick Marleau is another crazy beast. Some of the plays he makes and the goals he scores are just incredible, especially the one today. So much patience! If this keeps up, definitly say goodbye to the Avalanche in 4.   Now tomorrow is game two of  THE TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS  and Philadelphia "sucky" Flyers. Newy isn't playing due to his bad back, but captain Mats Sundin is expected to return to the line up. Owen Nolan should be making his return soon too .. and believe me, Leafs in 6, I have faith! GO LEAFS GO!   Tomorrow is also Tampa Bay and Montreal in game 2. Although I  AM NOT  a Habs fan by any means, I'd like to see them win so we can have the Original Six showdown in the conference finals.  But thats all for now I guess. GO LEAFS GO and SUCK FLYERS SUCK!  "your vaccuum cleaner ate my pants .. there was nothing I could do"
