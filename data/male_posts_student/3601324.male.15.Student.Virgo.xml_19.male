You know the one where he ducks and then does sort of a slide kick on the floor? Long story short, I can't do that. ;) Wouldn't it be cool if I could though?  Thus far, it's been a pretty uneventful weekend. I'mma try to get a ride to Casablanca Comics later to pick up a few comic books I've been wanting. I'll probably see if Ian wants to do anything tomorrow too.
