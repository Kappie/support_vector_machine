And no, it doesn't look like hair on a mouse; It's Black, kinda' brown, and I use this gel, It's called crew comb, and has a different smell; I wake up, take a shower, and do my hair, What's that underthere.....underwhere? Haha I made you say underwear, cat! Get back or I will attack, and you don't want that! Some people think my hair is spiked, I tell them, yeah so what..get a life; That may sound mean but make sure you know, That hair spiked it NOT AN ACT OF REBELLION - YO! That's one of the things our school kinda zones, Instead of spiked style, we have to wear Bob Jones! Yeah Bob Jones, the true and eloquent style, The only thing that goes with it is a really cheezy smile : ) But anyway, I'm not bitter I swear! It's just another rule that's well...just..there! Seriously y'all, keep it real in da' hood And If you want corn rows get your hair did good....   Thanks yous allz (applause) (the bongos bongo all night long)  That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.
