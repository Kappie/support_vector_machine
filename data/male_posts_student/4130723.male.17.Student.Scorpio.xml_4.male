Well anyways today I went to work at Oakland Nurseries from 8 till 4 it sucked it was all hot and people were being rude. The only good thing that happened today at work was I saw my old friend josh from middle school. When I got home I took a shower and went to my bud Ian Horrocks' house we sat around and shot stuff with our air soft guns. Then I got home from there at 10:30 and ate some food. Then I watched some lame ass show on tv and came up to my room and made this lil thingy. yep so today turned out to be ok.
