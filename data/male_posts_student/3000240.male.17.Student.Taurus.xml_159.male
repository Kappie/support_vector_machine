No place for Mutu tonight, or Tiago. Couldn't tell if it was Tiago or Carvalho running sprints after the game (think it was Tiago) but clearly they need a bit more fitness.  You've by now seen the lineup, with much the same as the second half of the Celtic game. Kez and GudJ had a go at their chemistry; Cole, Parker, Maka, and Geremi in the middle; Terry and Johnson (again) in central defense with Baba and Ferriera out wide. Once again absent was any presence on the left of midfield, especially going forward. Cole was left to roam and gave Roma quite a time, as he popped up here, there and everywhere. He went forward any chance given, and hassled any white shirt stupid enough to hold on to the ball too long. A tenacious bulldog would be a great description. The first goal was due to his persistence as he battled the ball free, dropped it off to Geremi who returned it through for Joe to score a quick low shot ... 1-0 Chelsea. Geremi's involvement was bound to be there as he was excellent throughout; great switch-field passing, two excellent threaded, weighted passes through to Kez, and the one-two with Cole all showed Geremi what appears to be JM's choice for right midfield. He's played both games on the right and tonight was better than against Celtic. Nothing from the left of midfield however and it seems that when Robben or Duff are not in the side, the play is dominated from the other side of the field. Not one cross, as Cole moved in too many other circles in different areas of the pitch. GJ ran into space on the left a couple of times, but wasn't able to cause any trouble for Roma. He went missing for quite a while also and probably didn't have his best game. Parker and Maka were both solid but not spectacular and both appeared to defend more than attack. Parker linked very well but passed forward much more than press up into anything remotely offensive. I found the two in central midfield an odd mix frankly, and were it not for Cole, it may have remained 0-0.   All the back four were solid. JT was outstanding, Ferriera quite comfortable, and Johnson and Baba played very good as well. Good forward movement from both the right and left. Up front, like I said, GJ was not a factor, but Kezman was every bit the 30+ goals the Dutch league got out of him last season. While the calls for offsides were numerous, I think the total in the first half alone was five, what can you expect against the Italian's defense. They absolutely had no attack and marked our movements fairly well. They had the off-side trap down, that much is for sure. But Kez is very scappy, and very persistent. He does appear to be a bit of a loose cannon also - lots of arm waving at the calls, hasseling around the ball, and moving constantly when off it. He is going to be a handful for any team we face, especially the Arse.   Half-time switches saw Gallas for Johnson and Bridge for Baba to make what more than likely looks like our back four. I see no change in our record shut-outs or goals against. Solid and sure. Not to many set pieces to contend with tonight so the clean sheet should be a boost for sure. JT in particular was fearless and everybit the Captain. Every bit!   Cole made room for Robben on the left, Lamps and Smertin took over duties in the center, and Geremi remained on the right. I can see this also as our starting midfield, especially as Duff works into his fitness. Smertin has really impressed and no one should be afraid of him in place of Maka. He is so controlled and his passing is spot on. Maka tends to run a lot, assasin style, winning balls and breaking up moves forward by the opposition - basically what a good DM should do. Smertin does the same, but then in a flash has linked up with the front for a quick move forward. I didn't rate him last season, but he is on so far. Lamps again went missing for spells, threw a few errant passes out, and all and all did not make his presence known like we know he can.   Up front for the second half was what I believe many have been waiting to see - the partnership of Kezman and Drogba and I for one was impressed with what I saw. They played off each other very very well. While both had great movement and were looking to always score from a midfield assist, they also worked off each other well. There movement is what I enjoyed the best and will just give fits to so many teams. Robben's run down the left produced the second goal as he pulled it back at the last possible moment - Kezman was there to crash it home. The third was from Lamp's hard low shot which couldn't be handled by Roma's keeper, bounced out about a step or so only to have Drogba come crashing in to poke home. Very quick onto the ball he was - a true poacher at work!!   But before that we had the sending off of Kezman. To be fair, he was trying to standup for a teammate, which I like. However, he could have let the ref do his thing and Dacourt would have walked and Chelsea could have gone on to score 5 or 6 goals. Also to be fair, I think Kezman was rushing Dacourt to simply get in his face but as he charged him, Dacourt responded defensively with a punch, Kezman got locked up with him, and the rest is history. Both were ejected and probably rightly so. I hope the red card doesn't effect any Premiership games. Robben limped off a few minutes after and Duff came on. Again, many balls down the left, as they were with Robben. Duff also had a number of cheeky little moves and deft touches. He had a sweet one touch-back heel to Lampard and looked everybit ready for the season to start. He only played 20 minutes but it was fun to watch. Again, Robben or Duff is the hardest question to answer for me.   All and all Chelsea were pure class and out played Roma from the start. I think they had maybe two shots on goal, created very little chances throughout, and never threatened. Totti was the only bright light for them, and then only barely. He went off after 60 minutes with nothing to show for an average night's work. There was something like 8 yelllow cards, compared to just 1 against Celtic, with some nasty tackles from both sides, Dacourt's being the absolute worse. The second half 11 could be the one and I for one could live with it. Believe Cudicini is going the full 90 minutes against Milan. I think it's his spot to lose but Cech sure is not making it very easy for him. This could be the season lads!   MoM - Geremi/Cole first half - Drogba for the second. SongoM - Uh, crickets chirping maybe? No atmosphere sadly to say and the whole game could do with some singing.  WhineroM - Totti for sure. If he spent as much time running as he did complaining and putting his hair behind his ears, he might impress. Never a real factor but hey, HE thinks the ponytail looks good!  Wild man from the hills oM - THE KRAZED KEZMAN! I thought he was gonna pull a Cantona flying drop kick on Dacourt for a second there. No kidding.  FansoM - My two mates who joined me for their first ever soccer match!!! I explained a few things along the way but I think CFC has two more converts. My missionary work is done for the day. xBuBzx
