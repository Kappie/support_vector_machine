A couple weeks ago, right before the July 4th weekend, my mom, sister, (doggy) and I all went to New Jersey to visit with family and for my mom to spend time with my grandma who's in this "Convalescent" home aka rehab center but, euphemisms will fool anyone, right? So my mom would spend 12 hour days with her for the week we were there and, it was hard on the whole family. My sister, cousins and I were left home by ourselves all day so we had to fend for ourselves and...do nothing. :) Anyways, the trip was too short and we had to come back...so yeah.  Then...er I did nothing except play baseball, sleep, and work for the past few weeks..  Hm..this morning I woke up around 7:15, wondered why my parents weren't up for church, but...whatever, fine with me. I lay there...trying to sleep, but nothing...So I just lay, lay, lay and then eventually I fell asleep, only to be woken up by my mom at 9:33...yes, 9:33. She hands me the phone, I say hello and well, it's my baseball coach..   "Ian, are you planning on coming to the game?!"  "No, I told you last week I wouldn't be able to."  "When I asked who couldn't make it, I didn't see your hand raised, that's why I said 7 guys could make it."  "Sorry, I said on a few occasions I wouldn't be able to make it, not just last game."  "Well this puts me in a jam, we need guys...what are you doing anyways?"  "I'm going to church."  "Can't you uh..go another time?!"  "No."  "We need you."  "Sorry, I can't come."  "FINE, bye."   So he was a bit ticked I couldn't come, even though I told him at the past 3 games I wouldn't be able to make it. Yeah, sucks for my team, but it's not my fault he can't count. I tried to be as polite as possible, but not let myself be suckered into changing my mind just to please people, and I didn't so that's good...besides, he's probably one of the last guys I would do a favor for...I can't stand him as a coach...  OH WELL. Church was fun...It was  Bring Your Neighbor Day  so there were a bunch of new faces which is nice...afterwards I was skeptical about staying but I was cajoled into doing so with the teasing of...free food. So I stayed, hung out with my ex's little brother and his friend, and then another girl who goes there...I had a good time though, it was worth staying for. Anyways, I left at about 1:00 and then by about 1:23..yes, 1:23 I got home. (I'm pretty precise with time..sorry).. So I got home in 23 minutes and traveled about 3 miles on my skateboard...that's pretty good time. But yeah, now I'm just talking to some people online, playing with my deck of cards and...writing in this stupid thing. :D  But I'm going to go.  SO BYE.
