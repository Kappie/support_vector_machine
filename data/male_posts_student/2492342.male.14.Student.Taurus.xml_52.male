I was so scared to death I would sya soemthing wrong. because, see, this sitn like any random translator job. i translated and if is aid somehting wrong, the person could die from the wrong medicine or from wrong diagnosis of a disease. It was a stretch soemtimes, but it was rather easy most of the time. I learned how to do some vitals, but i didnt perform them on anyone alone, i feared i would do them wrong. the one lady i did do it for, i got it exactly right tho.  IT WAS SO SAD! there was this one girl...see, there was this smallish hall where teenage nurses were doing vitals for everyone who came in, and then there was one doctors office and on the other side a few tables where they gave out meds and glasses and stuff. So i was helping anyone who needed a translator, and at one point the indian girl(sabrina?) called me in to the doctors office to translate. i went in..... and there was this girl half crying and her mom. sabrina told me the mom wanted a translator because she didnt speak english, but her daughter did. the doctor was asking her(rather rudely..he didnt have any compassion for her) what hurt and how mcuh and stuff...she was in 7th grade 11 or 12 they said...and so he didnt know i was a translator so i answered a question he gave a nurse there about which organ was where the girl pointed(he knew, he was testing the nurses) and she didnt know..i offered appendix or kidney, it was kidney, so he liekd me. so..umm...  i got a lesson in bio. but the girl said she hadnt eaten in 4 or 5 days, only drank water, and was in a lot of pain. she was taking some meds from honduras. and the doc told the nurses that the meds were horrible for growing people, they turned theiur teeth permanently black..so at this point i stopped him and said this to the woman in spanish...it was horrible having to say this...and soem other stuff..i asked her questions...all the while, he wasnt telling me anything to say, I had to choose what was important or not...GOD HELP ME....so then he said to the girl that he was gonne give her meds and if she didnt feel better in 12 hours, she had to go to the emergency room immediately....aftyer geting chest x-rays.....tiene que...que...llevarla al cuarto de emergencia si ella no sienta mejor en...en..(someone else offers doce..)..doce horas...it was awful saying this. Also that this was SERIOUS, but not a disaster...i remember i repeated that a few times....OH yeah! she had pneumonia...i ahd offered appendicitis because i had hoped for that. well finally the doc turns to ehr and says that she shouldt have waited this long..and that its really serious....  God.....  finally I ask sabrina if she can bring in a native hispanic person to make sure the lady got ALL of what she needed to know.......she explained it quickly again to the lady, then left....so i translated a little more until the lady left...  The rest was much easier and less stressful. i talked to people about how long they waited, what hurt, etc...some people waited 5 hrs, its sad.    on the drive over(my mom let leila drive!) my sis had sort of goten mad at me because..well....for her to get the job she had had to go thru A LOT of stuff, but that since i knew spanish(something she was also bitter about...she doesnt use it enough to be fluent and she forgets a lot...plus, years of talking pidgin with ceci scarred it...) i got thru without problems or applications...they did give me one afterwards, but im too young to legally work there, so if the authroties find out, the lady who gave me the applic will say she didnt see...they needed spanish speakers....  i met a guy named ashkan....half persian, black...i told him ym religious situation..hes the same, excpet bahai-> mormon(fake)....  I skipped studying for 2 tests, an in class essay, and a quiz..lol  ill write more later i think  much love  peace  ~alex
