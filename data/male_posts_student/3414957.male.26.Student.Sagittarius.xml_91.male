The part when he is about to eat that hamburger and looks at it and says, "does this look like spit to you....awww fuck it". LOL   I think I will just watch some reruns of The Sopranos dvd's. They make me happy. I love the violent humor of the Italian mafia. Of course there are the 1,000 web/computer projects I got going on now. I do those tomorrow at work.   What goes up....must eventually come down and vice versa.
