Maybe because I talk too much, and it kind of makes this blog look like a textbook with a lot of text. Who wants to read that... I get dizzy just looking at it.  Well that's what happens when you use a template created by blogspot. Thing is... I hate designing :) :). I'm not a very good web-designer. I don't know the first thing about harmony of colours, or composition of objects or any of that stuff.
