I can't even explain what happened this week.  I now have an even deeper love for my Savior than ever before. And I really believe that my church has gone deeper in the Spirit. And I believe that we're on the verge of really seeing God's glory! I really wish that all the churches all across this nation could experience what we experienced this week.  I bless the Lord for all that He has done and all that He is going to do.  And I thank everyone for reading this Blog I know you don't have to but yet you do.
