All I need is you, for always and for ever, All you need is me, just listen when I say, All we need is love, for us to be together, 'Cos your my Number 1.  At the end of each day, Or whenever you're away, There's always things I want to say, But wherever you go, You will always know, That I've got so much more to show, You're my number 1 prize, When I look into your eyes, It's only then I realize. You're the one for me, There's no one else I want to see, There's no place I'd rather be.
