So i went to school, knowing jolly well that i would be decapitated from the very first period... firstly i did not bring my school badge, next, i did not do my h/w, and, i did not bring my PE attire... Totally Screwed...crap BUT, i did not arrive to school late, did not get punished for improper attire, or yellow forms for late h/w's... Sadly, i had to serve my sentence for being late, way back in March...two hours of detention (sleeping) To summarize today, i feel good~
