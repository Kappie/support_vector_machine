Now listening to  Bad Religion 's  Tested . A great live album.  So today... I woke up around 9 AM chatted with Melissa and posted stuff on message boards about the greatness of the Chronicles of Narnia in comparison to the Lord of Rings. Then I had lunch and slept for a couple hours.  I need to write 4 more pages, proof read and mail my paper to Benita by 11 AM tomorrow. Argh... I hate being sick. I've been pretty physically inactive for the past few days. I sleep well over 12 hrs a day, and I can feel my muscles atrophy. I'm going to be so out of shape when I go to concerts next month.   *
