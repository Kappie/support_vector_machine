This I assure you so that what comes next doesn't seem like mindless self-deprecation.  I am having a problem. It's called youth.   I'm very concious of the fact that I am a baby still, and I try to keep everything in perspective that way. But lately I've been feeling like maybe all of these actions which I attribute to youth aren't youth at all—maybe I'll be this way forever. I know it's youthful to assume that something will never go away, and I tell myself this. But it isn't that simple, of course.  I hate the feeling I get, that I get more and more, like "Shit, I've said to much again" and I have this nagging fear that this is the reason why no one thinks to strike up a conversation with me in classes or at shows or wherever. I'm just not mysterious enough, just too apparently young. Annoying.  And I tell myself that I'm getting better, that this is just another bout of melancholy, and I always bounce back from that, it just levels me out. But I'm afraid. I'm thinking maybe this behavior isn't just a phase. Maybe this is a personality I'm bound to for life, that will change only nominally as the years go by and experience punishes me. I'm afraid that I'm doomed to be a little too annoying, a little too excitable, a little too obvious, a little too honest forever. I'll never be able to drink with my family or go out with my friends without someone saying "Whoa, settle down." I'll always have to go up to people and interject myself into their conversations because, for one reason or another, they just don't think to approach me.   I'm willing to believe that my personal diagnosis is just as childish as my actions—that there is nothing more childish than saying "always", "forever" and "never."   But I guess that always goes away with age.  First of all, pick a letter, any letter  Got one? You should by now.  OK. For the following questions, all your answers must begin with the letter you just thought of. (Honor system here, my friends!) Have fun with it!   My letter is K  1. Name two types of food that you could care less if you ever ate again. Kumquat and Kamut  2. Name one animal. Kangaroo  3. List three words to describe yourself. Kind, kinky and kooky (Oh boi!  That was a hard one!)  4. Name two things you might find at a zoo. kangaroos, kumquats, kind people (I would hope!)  5. Name three things you might find living in the water. Give me a break! Kelp, ummm... Ken (Barbie's boi)?   Ohhhh!  NEWS FLASH   Oh wait...KEN AND BARBIE BROKE UP! Okay someone seriously hug me, console me, I don’t know what to do! Is there hope for any of us? Ugh...the hurt, the anguish! My life has been dealt a terrible trial!  OMG!  Why do atrocities such as this happen!  Apparently Barbie is jealous of Midge because she gets to be pregnant and Barbie in her forties may be going through menopause…  The horror and Ken will isn’t a sexual kitten anymore…  I am gonna cry now…  Where the hell is my blankie?        THE STAR MANGLED BANNER   There is such outrage when some idiot decides to burn the American flag. It's unpatriotic, in bad taste and no way to treat an innocent fabric. But there are other ways of slagging a country, whether intentional or otherwise. Christina Aguilera and Nelly Furtado pulled off what has to be the first doubleheader of national anthem desecration while singing (?) the anthems of their respective countries at three days ago’s NBA all-star game. Furtado started things off with a nasally-tinged version of O Canada that included an attempt at singing in French. Conan O'Brien is sure to be relieved after Furtado botched the Quebecois portion of the anthem. French Canada now has someone else to bitch about, as if O'Brien and Don Cherry weren't enough. Aguilera is another story altogether. Would these dumbass divas who are invited to sing The Star Spangled Banner just please sing the song the way it's supposed to be sung? Aguilera's bastardized version included an extreme amount of oversinging that would have made a Celine Dion rendition sound like a whisper.  For the record, it is "the land of the free, and the home of the brave." NOT "the land of the free - er - eee - ooohhhh - yeaaaahh - yesyesyesyesetcetcetcburp (pause) and the home (another pause) of the-ee-eee (pause yet again) braaaaaaaavvvvvvvveeeeee (hold last note for an eternity)." Who's to blame for bringing anthem mangling into the mainstream? It must have started somewhere. A classic anthem singer like Kate Smith must be rolling in her grave, if only to generate enough sound to block out the horrors of today's generation of singers. Maybe it's all Matt Groening's fault. I used to think the Simpsons episode where Bleeding Gums Murphy sings a twenty minute anthem was funny.  Now it's just prophetic.  More lists!  Read Each One Carefully and Think About It a Second or Two    1. No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry.  2. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have. (TIM) 3. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart.  4. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them. (To you know whom not Edwin) 5. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile. 6. To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.    7. Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't willing to waste their time on you.  8. Maybe you need to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful.  9. Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened.  10. There's always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around.  11. Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you.  12. Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to.   SO I AM GOING TO BE STUCK IN HIGH SCHOOL UNTIL JUNE OF 2005, BUT I WILL GET  CNA LICENSE AND 5 AP COURSES AND MORE PRACTICAL LEARNING. SO NYC I WILL SEE YOU SOON BUT LIVE THERE A LITTLE LATER.
