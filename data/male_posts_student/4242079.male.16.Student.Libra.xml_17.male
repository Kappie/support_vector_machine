Jason Wade keeps singing his Lifehouse songs:   Could you let down your hair Be transparent for awhile? Just a little while To see if you're human after all Honesty is a hard attribute to find When we all want to seem like We've got it all figured out Well let me be the first to say that I don't have a clue I don't have all the answers Ain't gonna to pretend like I do  Just trying To find my way Trying To find my way The best I know how  Well I haven't memorized all of the cute things to say But I'm working on it Maybe I'll master this art form someday If i quote all the lines off the top of my head Would you believe I fully understand all these things I've read  I'm just trying To find my way Trying To find my way Trying To find my way the best that I know how  Well I haven't got it all figured out quite yet but Even if it takes my whole life to get to where I need to be and if I should fall to the bottom of the end I'll be one step back to you  Tryin to find my way    There is a cat on the road. An ordinary housecat, reduced to roadkill. It makes me sad to know, that in a blink of an eye, you can loose everything. And we will all die. But I'm not ready for that yet, and so I ignore the cat, that reminder of frailty and mortality. I pull into your driveway. You hug me. For a long time. It is nice. You know I'm sorry for what I put you through. But what about what you put me through? Love is a funny thing.  Reminded of the cat, I take an alternate route home.  urlLink  postCount('nov252002');
