There's nothing nicer than a big block v8 under the hood; all you ricers can go fuck yourselves.  Now don't get me wrong, rice rockets have their appeal...what else can you spend 30 grand on and only make 15s in the 1/8th mile? I mean...that's fuckin fantastic!  Yeah right.  If you've ever been to a real race (circle track, road course, or drag strip) you know that nothing's gonna beat the pounding of 8 cylinders. Not even a wimpy little 4 cylinder with twin turbos and NOS.  I like big cars, old cars, fast cars. I like old school...  What the fuck are you gonna do about it?
