Someone who has their future planned, someone who turns in their homework on time. I wonder. Is there less presure, I as far as I know nobody who is my freind knows(with the exception of Alison), not Parker, not Garrett. I freaking hate who I am. Its the thought of having a miserable life that drives me onward, the irony is sickening. Here I am having a miserable life and my motive to continue is so I won't grow up to live in a dumpster 2 miles away from someone like Garretts house. My life freaking falls apart so fast...Parker is leaving next summer, I hate to say this Garrett but I like him as a freind more than you. I got into Geometry, it was fun I actually liked it, I got kicked out. Damn it sucks. I'm having a good day and I come home and do something wrong. I fall to sleep everynite thinking about why me. I'm a freaking self absorbed egotist but I don't give a crap...The very least I can do is just type and type somemore. This is where I belong. I belong here in cyberspace, I live here this is my life. My life in a box of circuts and silicon. This is who I am. I don't belong out in the real world. I belong here... I hate the fecking Academy I should leave. I should leave and use the tuition to buy 6 AlienWare comps and network them and get a T1 line and use the left overmoney to buy a 1 gig memory stick and a new car. Damn the only reason I like it here is because we freaking computers. If I was in public school I could just take a heck load of AP classes, dammit you can finish the entire geometry class in 7th grade. This is gay. 12.4k to go to a school that says its good...My dad has a freind who's son who is among the top 50 math kids in the nation and he didn't send him here. Wanna know why?! Its because you can't advance as fast here. Another one of my dads freinds never went to private school in his life and he is one of the smartest people I know. My cousin he's among the top 10 math people in the nation he went to public school. I'm beggining to hate it here. I think deep down inside I want to leave. The only thing blocking me is that public schools have no comps for use during free periods and I have no freinds there.  I doubt anyone read the whole thing anyway so I'll just stop here.
