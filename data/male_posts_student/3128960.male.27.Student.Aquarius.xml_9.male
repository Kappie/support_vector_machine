You know the game: cardboard permutations of numbered grids; plastic chips for the young or unprofessional; ink-based blotters for the old or professional; interminably flickering fluorescent lighting; the sickly sweet stench of kool-aid or ensure; a complete lack of distinction between diastole and systole; frenetic scanning; ocular exhaustion; growing distrust for your "friends"; seething hatred for Grandma Jenkins, who just raked in bingo bank...  Basically your shit is amped and your attitude is hard. You are taking numbers and kicking ass; eliminating them left, right, up, down, and even droppin' them on the diagonal.  Just give me B-13. B-13. Bee Thirteen and that shit is mine...  Rev. Smith twirls the Bingo globe and the next chip falls into his hand. B-13. It's fucking yours.   At this point, you need to lay claim to your prize money. In the vast majority of cases, this will transpire something like this:  "Bingo!" "I have Bingo"  Say that out loud and see how lame it sounds. The phrase belies the hard-ass bingo attitude you worked so long to cultivate. Now, when the Reverend calls out B-13, what if you could lay claim as such:  "BLINGO, bitches...what? say sumthin. Jieah"  I dunno. That's it. That's the epiphany. In my view, this name change will concretize the true nature of the game--the shit is gangsta--a nature that is sadly masked in its current incarnation  And Denise Bracken said Ice-T's "Colors" was a wack track. The only thing wack is your lack of respect, new jack.
