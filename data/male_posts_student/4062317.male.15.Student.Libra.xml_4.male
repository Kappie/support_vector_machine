How every student hate the fact they are going to go back but also embrace it because they get to hang out with thier friend again. Well thats where I'm at. I don't want to head back to school but the lazing around is starting to get to me, I do the same things every day. I sleep in then wake up to cook breakfast for my brother and sister. Sometimes I hep my Dad with work others I watch tv and then I sometimes swim in the pool. When my parents get home we have diner and then we usually go for a swim around 9 O'clock. Then I stay up until 12:30+. So where is this all going and what am I getting to..... well I don't know. Maybe it was the fact that I was glad my routine is going to be broken tommorrow as one of my best friends is coming over tommorrow maybe I just had nothing to write about. So here is a message to you Yuiichi bring mgs:tts, your laptop, Unreal 2k4, and .... I dont know anything else you want. You probably already pissed that I keep reminding you but I'm just used to King Mericon forgetting everything.  Lates,  Smog
