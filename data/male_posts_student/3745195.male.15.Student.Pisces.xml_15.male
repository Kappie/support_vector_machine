I mean he could have any girl he wanted and as many as he wanted. Personally not my idol, I believe there should only be one other at a time, not multiple partners at once. Maybe for some that's acceptable. Okay enough of me trying to understand up to date things like pimps. So, How is everyone doing out there? Good? Good, that's good to hear. Today I doubled up on my runs, and at conditioning it was Bo, Alex, Skuyler and I. We dropped skuyler after 6 minutes and then with like 1/2-3/4 of a mile left I started pulling away from Bo and Alex. It was kool, but then I decided I should slow down cause it was supposed to be an easy run. Well enough of that boring run stuff, now onto... actually onto nothing cause I have to go do my dishes. Talk to you all soon (i hope)  Love you all  bye  "Just thinking of you makes my life even better,  and just knowing you care makes me feel whole.
