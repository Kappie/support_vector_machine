Josh's cousin, Patrick, is supposedly taking his friend, Josh, his older sister Amanda, her friend heather, and I to water country... if we can all fit into his Ford Explorer. Then, I had to beg my mom to pick us up and she's going to around 5:00... but she wasn't too happy about it because she goes to the Riverside Wellness and Fitness center AKA "the gym" religiously... I think, Monday, Wendnesday, Friday, Saturday morning, and Sunday.... and if she goes to the gym on those days, she will not miss one class. I had to quit working and taking guitar lessons because she couldn't drive me on monday evenings because it was a pain for her and a pain for me because as soon as I got home from school at 3:00, I had just enough time to make a veggie burger, eat, check my e-mail, and go and be back with about 2 minutes left for her to change her clothes at the gym and get set up after dropping me off at home. My dad bought this bathroom cleaner chlorine bleach spray stuff because I had mold in my bathroom, and while I was doing something earlier, he came in and sprayed the corners of the wall where it was growing in the shower and he didn't wash it out and never told me he didn't. So after a few hours, I am coughing and choking and he came in asking me if allergies were bothering me and I said "It's the bleach" and I ask if he ever rinsed it and he said he didn't. So I wash the tub and all around it and it's still making me cough, sneeze, and choke. Don't get me wrong, I love the smell of an indoor swimming pool, But i'm not fond of choking on bleach or chlorine fumes. Anywho... it's 12:50... and I have a few to spare. The average person falls asleep in 7 minutes. Hmm... I was about to post and thought "average person"... that was worded wrong. Most people fall asleep in an average of 7 minutes is what I meant. Anywho, posting my moods. I'm out. Much love.   Mood - Agitated, sleepy, bored, anxious Music/Sound - The clickity click of my keyboard, my feet squeaking as I scratch my toe on the hardwood floor, the whirr of the wall unit air conditioner, the fan on my computer hard drive.
