If there were these two spies, and they put this tracking device on this guy, and they're tracking him via their spiffy computer equipment, and he's not moving, and one spy says to the other, "Where'd you put the device?" and the other replies, "On his shirt, why?" "Did you ever think, while you were doing it, that maybe he would eventually change his shirt and the device would come off with it?" Then they'd probably just laugh and get over it, but who knows?
