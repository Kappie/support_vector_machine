The Matrix Reloaded . Let's get the obvious questions out of the way.  I liked it.  I know there are alot of divided views on it and about how it doesn't live up to the hype and that the story is too messy with too many holes and gaps in the plot.  But I liked it nevertheless. Why?   Because I know that  Reloaded  is only a part of a full story which includes at least two episodes from the  Animatrix , the video game  Enter the Matrix  and of course the to be shown  Revolutions . Of particular note is the game  Enter the Matrix , written and directed by the same two brothers, which leads into and takes place the same time as  Reloaded . Alot of plot holes and questions are answered in the video scenes in the game and they help to develop and explain the other characters and events that appear in  Reloaded , but are not focused on. However, all this branching out makes the movie seem empty and the story fragmentated.  I knew that we would be getting more of what we have seen in the first movie. I didn't expect the same degree of awe and wonder as the first one, but instead a continuation of a story already in progress. I'm glad that they answered questions from the first movie such as how Zion looks like, the other ships and their captains and crew and what Neo can do.  I especially like a story that already has an established beginning and end, unlike most movie sequels and many TV shows which only tact on stories when needed. This allows for compelling storytelling such as foreshadowing, build-up, red herrings and plot twists. I believe that writing so far ahead requires and allows research that enriches the overall experience and story world. I enjoy discussing stories and discovering whatever meanings and little points that may be. I believe in respecting the effort that the author has taken in crafting the tale, especially in this age of instant entertainment, were it is experienced and discarded just as fast.  Lastly, I just love the concept of  urlLink The Matrix . It has alot of elements that I find intriguing and cool such as martial arts, oppressive machines, computers and it's programs, the human struggle against an overwhelming foe, mirror shades, the philosophy of realism, Plato, religious concepts and guns, lots of guns.  Yes it may be not as innovative as the first one but I'm enjoying every minute of it as it reveals the story to the climax in the upcoming movie, just have to hang on for the ride. For now, let me get back to work.
