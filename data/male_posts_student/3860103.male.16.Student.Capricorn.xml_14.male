Upon learning that one of my father's friends shot himself in the leg while hunting, the first part of my personality said, "Oh, that's horrible."  It also warned its counterpart not to say what it was thinking lest it prove itself to be an asshole.  Ignoring the order, it said, "Haha, karma rocks!"
