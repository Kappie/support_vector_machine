Right now ish..19:19 ..25th may. i tell myself le..that today die die must write! b/c intiatially i wanted to write like 2 days back..when there's like ltosa things to put into fine print mans!! but delay delay procrastinate procrastinate..then ended up..with today? lolz..so i think today no matter wot..die or not die also must write..or else i scared later forget wot to type mahs.. all these things i wanna write it down..so i can look back uponz it.. =) actually i think really got lotsa sa sa sa stuffies to write manz...kKz..so let mua now reverse back time..and try to rmb wot i wanna write..lolz..        mMmMmMmmMmmMmMz..oOh yAh! i rmb-ed ler...lemme rewind time back to when it was saturday..okie okie?!? saturday..the whole day was quite plain..except that i went siwmming and slack and slack..lolz.tt particular siwmming lesson..mua coach..jErmeY made me swim about 20 laps in all lahz.. then he asked me to swim 2 laps Sets..then almost everything got butterfly in it..then to his surprise i didn't stop hehez..cos i normally swim butterfly..i surely will stop once..in the middle of the pool lolz..but this time i didn't thoh it's so much more lapz.i think i know why... and it's partially b/c of..miNg cHuan..hehez..she's like my motivation..as in don't give up! Then the funny funny malu part is that..when jermy asked me to swim on my back with freestyle kick..in breadths..then me so malu b/c siwmming on back ish more diff. to see whether ya going the correct direction mahs..then i so suay suay swam outta line!! then almost banged into this guy..heng manz..that i did not..=P then it was so malu-ing!! but thank goodness..as the yrs passed..i grew with more layers of skin ..lolz..so now much more thick-skinned!! hahaz.. so afterall not tt malu lahz. ;) hehez. that'z all for saturday i guess!        nOoow, let's tok bout sunday!lolz..sunday the earlier part of it..i went to churchie..but b4 going to church..my hse was like..quite a spectacle lolz..due to a perfromance put up by my sis..hahaz. she was like damn furious by my mom's consistent naggin for her to get ready..because my mommie doesn't wanna be late again.then my sis so angry went to scream at my mom..then threw my discman on the floor lolz..wot a temper for a bright sunday morning..hahaz.then well as for me..i jsut like bochup bochup lolz..then i went to church..and blahz..the fun part was going out! =XxX. i went out with arthur and loy..we went to watch shRek 2!! it was real funny manz! didn't know it would be tt fantastic..thoht it would sitnk big time..but afterall it turned out to be real good too! and dan loy went to buy this billabong shirt..and he like keep on kinda ask me "how's this..how's that...lolz.." but the crucial part of sunday was...in the movie theatre..not tt some funnie funnie thing happened in the theatre or wot arhz. ok lah..lemme tell the story now.. cos we were watching shRek right..then..there's this part of the movvie which shows the PuSS iN bOOtS [Shrek's character] being breathless..and this image immediately brought me to the thot of audrey..who got a bad asthma attack few wks back..so i turned next to arthur..and said "hey hey...audrey audrey...lolz.." then his reaction was like...lolz..pissed. cos he said "hey ..f**k u lah f**k u lah..f**k u ok..." then when i heard it i was like.. =X pEngS.. then at tt moment i realised the folly i made.cos i thot tt arthur might take it as a joke..but didn't knew he took it so seriously..at tt point of time lah.. b/c after a while he was back to his normal self..luffin and luffin again..lolz. but the pt. isssh that. i guess i shldn't have said that at all. b/c i don truly understand..wot death is..and wot it can do to the ppl..around u..so afterall..it's quitee..a sensitive thing..so i guess LESSON LEARNT : ziiiiiiiiip! shuddup. don't talk bout wot die die again.. lolz..! but really lah..i hope i could take this lesson well..anyway..let's talk bout more cheerful things..such as...during the movvieee..i was sitting beside a chio cute bu?!?! heheehz.. shiok rightz.. :) this gur can sense tt she's differnent.. b/c she doesn't mind bringin along 2 kids with her.. who r kinda young like pri 1 liddat into the cinema to watch with her..? this shows that she's really caring..hehez..and this kinda of gurs..are really.. a WOOOOHOOOOOO!! a 100% must GRAB! lolz.. =X. then after the movvvvieee..we went other places...such as PS..to makan..and stuff. then when we makan...dinner i sms-ed mC again..and asked "where she is workin.." cos..i hope to like u know u know lolz..to perhaps send her home after her work tt day..but in the end she replied..so late..until it's like im already at home..all bathed..hahaz. and u know..msg her got a bit stwess one.. cos u must type in a way that shows that u care and yet not to the super caring stage till like.. very protective that type..u know u know..mS. diary what mua toking?!? so when msg her like face a bit stwess too.. haiya! then and some more things add here and there..like rOjak..which made me feel like wan give up give up liddat manz.. but in the end..the followin day which is monday..i told myself ..that i will not give up!! hehez..! and btw..audrey also said something like..canot give up so easy and it's like only 1 mth + of me chasing her. 1 mth plus is nufifn..b/c her ex took 2 mths to chase her! so i guess..i shldn't give up..and keep on going and goin and goin! just like the bIg fiSh's main character..so determined to get anything he wants manz! so i guess no matter how long..wheter it's 2 mths..3mths..4mths..or even 6 mths..i cant give up! =D yeah!i! i must strive on..!          okok diaarrry! lemme tok bout..monday now! wOof! monday's a real big day manz.. as in got lotsa craBz..for me to write bout.lolz. the most big thing bout monday ish..X-country! our skool had our annual skool X-country at maritchie..reservoir..and since this is my last yr..i decided to run..as in jog jog.. and not give up...cos it's my last yr. b/c for the past 2 yrs i have been slackin..never run at all..just simply walked thru-out the dman thing. so this yr mustt cheoooooooooooong manz!! then at the starting of the run... moses..came up to me and tell me " those bballers..they say if joe steps down as chairman and they will saboh u make u chariman.." . Joe is my class chairman lahz.. and the bballers.. dislike me.. not all but.. at least 3 of them. Zijie, Derek, Xin yan. Zijie..it's b/c of a real super long conflict which i dont think i wanna wrtie bout. since it's so long. and derek and xinyan are influenced by zijie. so yeahz..when i first heard wot moses said i was like.."mmmmzz... " i was a little weeeny bit agitated.. very slightly.. then i told few persons.. like kum long ..and moses that i wanna win zijie in this X-country... if tt's i can..and so the run started..and i jogged and jogged.. at first daniel tan and moses were beside me..but later on they started to stop..and i didn't wanan stop b/c i know once u stop to rest for a few mins only..ur bod will like drop to resting state..and if u wanna jog again..it will be sooo much really so much more difficult..so i told myself i cant stop... and so yeah.. i got stop lah..but the longest i stop was like only 30 seconds? i run stop run stop...so yeahs..it's like that.then when i ran till like just come out of the jungle... i saw ZIJIE and ryan.. they were walking..the rest of the bballers were way ahead of them.then i walked behind them quietly ..lols..then when we reached the road..i started to run and overtook zijie and ryan..bet zijie was shocked. then i jsut kept run stop run stop. it was quite difficult..b/c i was really quite out of stamina...and my legs are a bit tired..and i really wanted to give up a lot..but i tell myself i cant!! i tried anything to get me going.. i even slappped my own face lols..with the beads of perspiration of spluttering over..lolz..then.. later on in the run..i really damn tired already manz.. so i decided to think of mc..think of everything i can..think of things like me asking for her hand.. about me... holding her hand..about me kissin her..lolz..practically anything i can think of! and it kinda worked..cos it like kinda took my mind off my physical state..then bloody hell! at one pt. of time..zijie actually caught up! but in the end he lagged behind.. then i managed to be in frnt of him..till the end! i also almost caught up with xin yan manz! but he ran away in the end..but im kinda proud of myself..b/c i did not give upp...for the first time in my life manz.. yst was like..the first time in my life i put in so much mental work and determination...to overcome..the odds. yeah so... i was just glad tt i didnt give up..and tt i won both of my enemies..muaahahahahahahaa!! LIM ZIJIE AND SUJITH KUMAR!! wooohooo!! then when i reached the end pt.. i was like damn happy i won them ..hahaz..and i told kum long..jun hong..moses..them ..but they like don feel happy for me..haha.=X and wot pissed me off most..ish wot moses and daniel loy said when i told them i won zijie. daniel loy said wot " why u all so childish and stufff... " dan was like a bit buay song also..i donno b/c of wot..then his buay song-ness added on to what he said really pissed me off. and then moses come tellin me " it's zijie don wan run lorhs.. if he run sure can beat u one lorhs.." at that point of time im so pissed with wht he said till i wanna scold him " u mutah****ing chee byee.. " now lemme tell u why im so pissed. b/c they all made it seem like... i can never win zijie..and that he's just see whether he wanan run or not. no matter wot... moses like always thinks i cant win him. but i m quite sure i won zijie based on my sheeerr determination. b/c zijie really hates me. and since if u hate someone so much..u wouldnt want to lose out to him right? it will be so malu right? and moses and loy thinks im so childish to like wanan win zijie. all i can say ish that..right from the start of the starting pt. till the end of the starting pt. i only have one thing in mind. and that ish NOT TO GIVE UP. it doesnt really matter if zijie wins or loses to me..the pt ish whether i myself give up on myself notx. but obviously if i had win him it would feel more good rights? One very good example i think it would be the rugby match bet. my skool and ACS(I) in the finals. it doesnt matter to the ruggers whether they win or not. it matters whether they put in the effort and whether did they train hard enuff and wehtehr did they let themselves down. whether they win or not..it ain't matter that much. but obviously if they win acsi they would be more happy right? any idiot knows that.. so yeah my pt. ish that i never really wanna win zijie. but my supposedly best friend moses..actually said thosee.. words. it's like none of them has faith in me. im just damn mad at moses. todya in skool i was reeal pissed with moses and zijie. i was so pissed till i told moses... tat " FUCK ZIJIE's mom and dad or wotsoever." i never really scold ppl's parents b4..b/c i don think they shld be at all. it's only when someone makes me so boiling mad...then i will say tt. so i guess u can imagine how pissed off i was. actually i have got so much more to tok bout this manz.. but i guess i don wanna elaborate too much on it.. cos sometimes... some things u just gotta let go a bit..or else u will feel more miserable only..makes u generate more hatred..so wot's the cue manz? all i can say is that.. im quite disappointed in moses. but nevertheless..i expected it. so yeah.         wOof! i think lemme tok bout other stuff alreadi...right?! now it's back to tok bout miNg cHuan againz.. yst she told me..she got some illness..and the mom donno say wot it's very serious if don go operation or wot will die suddenly. mC thinks her mom ish too exaggerating..and lolz..in fact i also think she's too exaggerating..but neverhtelss..i don wan it to be some serious illness or wot..so i told her..some mushy stuff lolz..but not too mushy lahz..but really wan her go see a doc immediately..and diagnose wotever the thing is.. and god bless her. really. cos mC's like..last time also got some funny funny illness happen to her when she's pri. 5... so i hope things wun repeat or wot.. yeahs..and recently ..she felt pain at her stomach.. haiya donno lah!! just hope nuffin will happen to her... that's all i guess.. mC take gr8 care okay ? *^_*^        yeah so i guess that's all for today's entry! woooof! finally!! after writing for like..2 hrs +? hmmmzz... yeah long long time manz.. just cant wait for 3rd of june to come..cos..got band concert..and harry potter!! i waited for 1 and a half yrs for hairy potter already kKz?!?! hahaa... okok lahs..i think i better sign off now.. cyaaaaaaaaaaa my cutie little diary...!! muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuackS! hahaz..
