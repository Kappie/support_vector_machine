I WANT CHOCOLATE!   #2 - remember , a bad hair day is a good hat day  #3 - life is short , buy the shoes  #4 - staying in shape is tough . . . unlless the shape is round, round is easy!   #5 - life has it's ups , life has it's dips. . . at least we have potato chips!   #6 - reach for the stars .. .. .. it will keep you're chest from sagging
