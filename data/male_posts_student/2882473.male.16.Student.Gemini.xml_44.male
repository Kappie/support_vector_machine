But revision is soooo boring. I'll do a bit of business, biology, and maybe a bit of maths. Probably a little of all the other subjects at some later date.  I would like to do a rant, as I haven't done one for ages, but what about? What about indeed...?  Well, maybe another time, because I'm about to watch an old episode of 'Friends', and then lots more tv all evening :)   Reading:  Interesting Times  Listening to:  'I'm Reviewing the Situation'  Watching:  Friday night good tv  Confused about:  The end of my school life. Can't quite believe compulsory schooling is all over...  Annoyed with:  No one or thing at the moment  Mood:  Fine
