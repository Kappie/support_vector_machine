After holding it down to let the glue setup, however, I noticed that I got two little spots of glue that ran down from the chrome frame that the windshield sets in; I can't keep anything nice!  In case you were wondering, in this photo the model is setting on the trunk of my fathers '57 (see photo in the last post.)  The color is called Tropical Turquoise.
