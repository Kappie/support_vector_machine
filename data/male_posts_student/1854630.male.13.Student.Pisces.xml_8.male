It made me remember why I loved blogging so much. Not that I blogged much in the first place, I think on my former blog I wrote all of about seven posts.  I bring this up because I'll be taking a leaf out of her book. Instead of writing the real name of someone who was involved in something I deem worth writing something about, I'll put their initials, in order to protect the identities of the innocent and such. Anyway, to the writing thing...    ac.  God, she's beautiful. I've got one period with her, and I'm just... I don't really know what I feel. We're great friends, and went out earlier in the year, but I was a jerk when we did. I dumped her in a note (what an asshole) that was about two sentences long (bigger asshole), and spelled her name wrong (biggest asshole ever.) Somehow, we're still friends. Good friends, too.   I dumped   ac   because she was going to dump me (yeah, I was an insensitive jerk.) She was being great, but I was sort of nervous about the whole thing.  I had (and have) only made out once, and I knew she was going to want to, so I was nervous about all of it. Wait a second, why would I be nervous about that? Aren't I the guy who-- yeah, I don't know why I was nervous. But the making out wasn't the whole issue, I was just ignoring her and acting incredibly different around her. She obviously noticed and got her friends to talk to me about it (if a girl gets her friends to talk to you about something, its definately a bad sign. Especially if you feel more comfortable talking to her friends about it than the girl herself.) I knew she was going to dump me, so I took the low road and dumped her first. In the note, I explained that my nervousness and lack of attention to her was due to the fact that I didn't like her in the first place.  After we broke up, everything went back to normal after a week or so. We were only going out for a few weeks anyway, and hadn't really done anything, so we weren't really going out in the first place. We're better friends than we were before then (we went out in January or so,) and do flirt alot. I like her, and I know I should tell her how I feel, but its so late in the year.  Alright, I'm reading this over, and I'm really the biggest loser in the world. I need to straighten myself out. I think I should apologize to her, or tell her how I feel anyway.      Confused...
