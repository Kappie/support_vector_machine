I went to bed listining to my Yellowcard CD and since that always reminds me of her when I listen to it I got really sad....I didn't cry....well maybe a little bit....ok a lot. All I have been doing the past few days is playing my guitar and listening to music...all that stuff calms me down. Plus I love music anyway so whether I am sad or not thats basically all I do lol. Well I must be off to school now but I will try to post later...*sigh*
