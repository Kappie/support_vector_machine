First I thought, "Well good for him!" Then I saw his 19 May entry. Unfortunately it appears that he's only well-informed in the computing area. He's a moron politically. Sorry, buddy: You are a political retard. If you'd rather have someone who has the charm of a plantar wart, the face of a clapped-out nag, the wisdom of Anna Nicole, the leadership ethics of Pol Pot, and the truthfulness of O.J. Simpson, then you are nothing more than a silly little liberal idiot.
