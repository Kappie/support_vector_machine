Well this all I can put together: _I was at some kind of lecture or a class with Columbia students. _We were sitting in some sorts of groups _I was with my history class and in all of my other dreams(and in real life) Amanda was sitting next to me _strange enough the seats were changed around a bit  _I was still sitting next to Amanda but now on my right was Emily(long story) _Somebody was playing Footsy with me and I thought it was Em  _I looked over at Emily and then looked back _I wasn't Em anymore it was Pedro Martinez! _That's right Boston Red Sox Pitcher Pedro Martinez _Now next thing I know I'm beatin the crap out of him _Mer is trying to pull me off him but she can't cause she's hurt herself _And the dream breaks apart   I haven't figured it all out but hopefully it will all come together around the people of my dream.
