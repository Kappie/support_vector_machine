Not attention seeking- depressed, like some people, more like I'm miserable. Looka this- if anyone remembers Ste's thesecondlife.tk then, well the similarities are a tad scary. Im just bored. And today we went to see a certain great-nanna who I haven't seen for ages. She was 86 the other day. Blah blahdy blah... old age is gonna get everyone in my family :-(   Meh, I've also 'fell out' with a lot of people lately, so it would seem. Bollocks :-( I want anti-depressants like Patten had. Hmf.. aven't seen him for about a month, either :-(  I stayed up till 4:30AM this morning with Luke on MSN. That is only 1 of the maybe 2 or 3  meaningful and decent conversation I've had with anyone on this infernal piece of techno-shit, this year :-(  Ffs, I'm just depressed.
