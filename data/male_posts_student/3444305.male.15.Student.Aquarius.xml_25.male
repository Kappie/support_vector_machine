I really did nothing else. Haley called and asked if I could give her and Ele a ride to band, so I left to go pick them up and went to band. We had Karth again. He gets out the stupid gock block. That man is nuts. But that's how it goes. But then they bribe us to go by giving us candy, which I guess all works out. Ele's mom gave me a ride home, and then I got online. My parents then told me I was going to Dairy Queen. So sorry I couldn't be outside when you went by Amanda. I wanted to though! I saw you driving there though! :-) Which made my night, so I'm in a happy mood right now. But I just found out someone found out my password. So if someone IMs  you on "A Lost Solution" (an old screen name i used to have) it's NOT me. So do not listen to them, and block them. People are out to ruin me, and I don't know why. It's getting really old though. Especially when I have done thing wrong to any of them. Well you can't let those people get to you. They are just sad, and I know how they got the SN now to. Which was very uncalled for by the kid. Who used to be against all this, but now some how is part of it. But yeah! My old password was jtbk13. I made it when I was 10 years old and the JT stands for a girl (Julia Thomspon) I met at a camp I went to (cute huh?), oviously the bk is me and I needed two numbers, so I picked 13. Just incase you didn't hear already. Well I really need to study, have a great night! Later!
