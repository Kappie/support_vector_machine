Well, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get up to Virginia this weekend, so i guess i'll have to make alternate plans. They're gettin snow, which means i'll not be allowed to make the drive.  SORRY MARIA, I REALLY TRULY AM SORRY. :(  In other news, our cult has a new member(well, i dunno if you could really use the term member, ;) )... her name is Vagina, Gina V for short. So our list of members is up to Me (The Eggman), The Walrus, Poop, Big Sexy, Epsilon, Booger, Gina V, and Tinklebell. Pretty soon we will obtain world domination.  So yea, i have a lot to say right now, but im too tired to think of the right words. i'll give it a shot tomorrow. Anyway, good night, sleep well, sweet dreams, and ---    realization  . i've had a lot of new friends over the past few years, but i still haven't learned how to act around people. I still have this complex where i'm kidna shy and can't just act normally around someone i like, and then they never get to know me, and in turn won't ever be able to feel the same way about me that i do about them.   *sigh*  i gotta get some help with that.  aight peace...
