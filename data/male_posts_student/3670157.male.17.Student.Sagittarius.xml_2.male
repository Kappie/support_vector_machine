However, I wrote this to portray the earlier days of my life that I lived in darkness and pain. I tried to pour as much emotion into as I possibly could. It ends on a fairly positive note. But the poem is basically my life's story.   Prideful Hate   By Jeff Bell  I looked this world in the eye  And tried not to cry  The only thing I could see  That bitter force glaring at me  It stared ever hard and long  Ignoring right and wrong  This world’s hate  Doomed me to a bitter fate   I couldn’t escape its call  So I let my mind fall  Into the endless night  Hating the right  And living the wrong  In one hate filled angry song   I hated this world it hated me  And I defied its evil tyranny  For years I held my ground  Loosing every round  I fought hate with hate  Refusing to see my mistake   I was a mindless pawn  Living Darkness escaping dawn  Joy fought through the black of night  Blinding me with it’s triumphant light  Brave friends then came  To put out this angered flame   Will this World ever learn  Peace and Love build not burn  Would life be this painful to live  If we had what love has to give  All this prideful hate  Will destroy what love creates
