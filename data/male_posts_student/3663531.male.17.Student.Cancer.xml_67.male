I revamped Swashagunga's Realm (Now Apotheosis of Something) and added some new material. Now all I need is someone to visit it...  My sister is moving to Melbourne, which opens up another bunch of options for my tertiary schooling plan. Still don't know what I want to do though... I got to thinking, I know people with willpower and motivation and pure desire to achieve powerful enough to just rattle my sense of myself. I have talents, not bragging, but I don't try very hard. I could accomplish more, but I started getting all funky "Why me?". It's like in Spiderman 2, where Otto Octavius tells Peter something like "you can't be a lazy turd just coz your smart". Maybe a little more eloquent, but who cares? You got the gist.  Anyhoo, expect slightly more regular posts (despite all the stuff I have left to do... anyone know anything about the Human Genome Project?) I don't know why, maybe my small sense of motivation kicked in. And I realised I can type way faster than I ever could.  Down with pens!
