Anyone who's been in contact with me since the last 5 months, knows that I'm currently in "A Perfectly Circular" state of mind. Back to Rage Against The Machine though. You must be wondering where Limp Bizkit fits into all of this... they're right dead centre of it all. RATM broke up because of Limp Bizkit, and that's a fuckin' fact.  *It's time for Flashback Sequence music and wavey moving pictures*  The date is September the 7th, in the year 2000. It's the MTV VMAs on... the stars are out, the lights are bright, the carpet is red. RATM and Limp Bizkit were nominated in the same category that night... what a disgrace to Rage... they even played with the Bizkit on the same day back in Woodstock '97. As legend would have it, Limp Bizkit won for whatever piece of shit song they got nominated for. At the same time, Tim C. of RATM decides to make like a monkey and climb a stage prop. That other simian in a baseball cap, Fred Durst, instead of trying to talk this motherfucker down, says something along the lines of "this guy's our biggest fan."  What a fuckin' asshole huh? If not for that drunk dumbass Tim C. and the rest of Rage Against The Machine, your cheesy band wouldn't even be around making music, let alone accepting awards. I'm no big fan of music award shows. I mean, who the hell are a bunch of people to hand out awards for best song, or best album? What is all this based on, besides manipulated stuff like radio airplay and charts and sales? The bottom line however is, if RATM had won in that category that night, they would have probably still been around today...
