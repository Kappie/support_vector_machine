Anewayz...aside from the advice from ur local extreme optimist, todae was a gd dae.  Day started off with house meeting and declaration of half dae tomorrow but head master...what a gd start rite? I enjoy half days more then weekends...hse meeting was fun...lotsa farni cheers and stuff...then later discussed my chi with ms ong think i'll not drop...but she seemed spprehensive about me not dropping...am i paranoid or does she really think i can't do it...  Then my inspiring light hearted speech at the atrium...yux onli got 16...so bad...nvm i enjoyed myself...lol Next kena mrs ng's sharp tongue...said my maths test was rubbish...argh i oredy knew tt...haiz gotta work harder in diffn...said i hav to go for remedial...ew...no time oredy lehz..  Then after sch did the psgm finale thingy...sincere gratitude towards louis for peiing2 me for the dunno how many timeth oredy to help do this sorta yucky stuff...thx alot really appreciated tt, muz make up ter u sometime. So i finally got the psgm huge board thingy going...it looks more presentable n stronger now...finally...now art filming...tomolo lahz probably. Btw uhu glue is really kinky...lol. And black duct tape...  Then went home walked towards mrt station, was damn farni. We were listening to Stacey's mom, and we were walking in sync along with the beat, then rite outside mrt station dropped some coins, so we had to split the ear phones, looked quite stoopid hoped no one noticed...lol.  Gambette everyone...do ur bez for the sch, and ur frenz this yr!!!
