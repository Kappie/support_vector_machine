But, since Jesus died on the cross,  one man , many can enter the Kingdom of Heaven through Him. Amazing!  I could be off on my interpretation of that verse...but it makes sense to me.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. ~ Psalms 23:4  ^another fantastic example of Scripture folks...
