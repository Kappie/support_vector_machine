Time is definately more important than money, but you see most people squander it as if they have an endless supply.  Why is it that some people are more effective and get more done in their life than others?   Simple, they take responsibility for their life and don't accept the excuses most people do.   If the first thing you do when someone asks you why you didn't do something you said you would, or were supposed to do, is give an excuse or reason why -- you are not taking responsibility for your life.  Big problem...  If you blame other things, situations, circumstances or people for what goes on in your life - you are giving up control of your life, saying that you had no choice but to do what you did. That makes you a slave, and I'm pretty sure you are not a slave.  Jonathan
