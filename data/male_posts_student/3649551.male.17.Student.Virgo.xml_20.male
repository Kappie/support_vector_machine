The further I get from that date, the better things seem to get. I'm not going to write a bunch about it, by the way. No point in depressing myself or anybody else. This may sound odd, but I'm thankful that it happened. I wouldn't be who I am today if my dad hadn't left. My parents' divorce opened my eyes to a lot of things and I'm grateful for it. I don't know if I'll go so far as to say I've attained some semblance of maturity, but I'm sure that will come at some point. I really don't feel like writing about this. I've talked about this stuff so much that I don't feel the need to write about it. I've dealt with it and there's really no need to continue whining about it. Something that is never hard to keep in mind: I've had an easy life compared to most people. It sounds cliched, and maybe it is, but a lot of people have a lot shittier lives than I do.
