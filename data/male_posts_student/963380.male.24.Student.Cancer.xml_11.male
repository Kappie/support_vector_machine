Here we go; it is going to be a Pontiac Vibe (shocker!) in either Neptune (blue), Abyss (black) or Shadow (dark grey). It will have the unpainted cladding around the bottom, like the Aztek (one of the bits about the Aztek that I've always liked). It will feature the sport package (6 speakers, 16" Aluminum Wheels, and a powered moonroof), the power package (windows, doorlocks, mirrors and so on), a cargo mat (so things don't slip around in the cargo area, but removable, so when I have filthy stuff, I don't have to worry about cleaning carpet), a bumper strip (prevents scratches, and you can stand on it - nigh essential for my needs), a snowboard carrier (my needs, as mentioned earlier), rubber floor mats (I live in Canada, hello), and  tinted windows (there's a lot of open space in the vehicle, and sometimes I don't want it looked in.  My eagle is a ripe 92 horsepower with 93 foot-pounds of torque. I don't know how I ever got around on this thing. The Vibe is 130hp with 128 footpounds of torque. It's going to be a real pleasure to drive this car. I'm shooting to get my payments around 300$ a month for the next four years. My parents are helping me out with that, which is exciting.  There's an opportunity that I might win the car for free. That would be cool, but I doubt it'll happen. I think what I need to do is find some way to consolidate as much money as possible over the next little while. If I can get that monthly payment even lower, I'll be in great shape. Well, that's enough for tonight.
