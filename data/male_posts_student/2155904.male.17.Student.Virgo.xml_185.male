Tyke has to believe that a part of her reasoning has been because of his class.  They have been somewhat brutal to her.  But it's all fun so that's all that matters.  But this means that there is definitely going to be at least one Retirement Party for her.  In 4th period today Tyke had to only have one lunch but it was still cool.  They didn't talk about anything productive in there other than Ashland stuff.  Here is a little advertisement that Tyke should really start having more of in his blog.  It has come to Tyke's attention that Piggy J is unaware of who he is going to take to prom.  Now ladies, if you don't know who Tyke is talking about then you are definitely out of the loop.  This is the man who can do a spot-on imitation of Mr. Dineen.  And folks, Mr. Dineen is one sexy son of a bitch.  Piggy J has great taste in music and is also the owner of a hott automobile that will in the near future be replaced by a car of his choosing.  So if that isn't enough to get your blood boiling (in a good way) then you are a little bit lesbian.  Just a little bit though.  But if you do think that Piggy J is one of the hot bachelors out there (not quite in Tyke's league but who is??) then just let Tyke know.  Tyke can try to hint to Piggy J that he should ask you to prom.  And if it isn't enough to go with Piggy J, you just might get to go in the same prom group as Tyke as well.  So there is another incentive.  Tyke's single too by the way.  *wink.  He's aware of his situation though.  Well, to continue with Tyke's day let's go to after school.  Tyke came home and ate some good food before leaving for his haircut.  He then went to Tina's house to pick her up for their dinner date.  It wasn't a date but how can you blame Tyke for wanting to say that?  Don't worry though, Tyke is past it.  A late addition to Tyke and Tina's dinner was Dotti.  So they went over to her house and picked her up.  She had FINALLY come back from Nashville and she told them about some stories there.  Then they got to La Costa where it was apparently silent taco night for the sign language students but they didn't eat together.  This was a really great dinner.  It was totally fun to sit and talk with two of Tyke's best lady friends.  They talked about lots of things.  Like prom, Tyke and Kram, Mexico, and just fun stuff.  Since Tyke doesn't get to spend much time with Tina it was awesome and then since Dotti has been gone for a week they haven't gotten to talk either so it was a stupendous dinner.  After they finally decided to leave and Tina gave Tyke his present (a beautiful framed picture of Tyke and Tina on Homecoming night) they went to Tyke's car so he could give Tina her present and card and Dotti her card.  Oh, but since Tyke just went to look at the picture of him and Tina he has to mention something.  Maybe Tyke is way wrong but he has seen two pictures of him in the last few weeks that make it look like he has a lazy eye or something.  First was his passport picture.  And now the picture at homecoming.  It's weird but Tyke doesn't look like he sees himself.  Sure he sees himself backwards from everybody else but he doesn't think he would get a messed up eye level thing going on.  But it is still a lovely picture and he doesn't care that much about his appearance so it's fine with him.  That's why Tyke shaved his head again (well, cut really short).  Now Tyke doesn't have to do anything to his hair before he goes out since it's so short.  Ok, back to Tyke's presents.  He got Tina one of those Neopets he got Purdy for her birthday.  But this one has a dirty voice.  It is just so naughty.  It is quite hilarious though.  And Tina seemed to like it which is all that matters.  The card he got her was this really weird card that is apparently for someone who is leaving a person under bad circumstances so the card is kind of angry.  But who ever gets a card for that situation???  It was so random that Tyke had to get it for her.  And the card for Dotti was a card that had this little reflective strip on it that is supposed to show the person who is reading the card but it shows a distorted version of the person so it sucks.  But it's funny.  Like Tyke (rhyme).  Well Tyke drove the two ladies home and said their goodbyes and Tyke came home to blog.  But this was a great night.  It was so fulfilling.  Nothing negative about it.  Other than it ending.  Now the OC finale is on though.  Which is way more important than West Wing.  West Wing...more like...wow, hard to change that into something funny.  Ok, OC.
