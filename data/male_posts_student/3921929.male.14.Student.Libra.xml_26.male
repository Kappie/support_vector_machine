Anyways, Scott went with Matt up to Wayne High, and I went to the skatepark with Kevin. This time Kevin only made up  one lie ! I should congratulate him for that! Well, I'm getting a lot better at my 180s. Yep, I'm getting better and better at everything every time I go there. I did a fakie noseslide on accident lol. I was trying to fakie boardslide but messed up. Oh well I'm gonna play Counter-Strike y'all.
