I don't really think because i've grown older..its more because that strong family aspect, which is the essence of most peoples' xmas, isn't there. Regardless though..i'm in a pretty damn good mood this christmas eve. Over the last few years i have been miserable. Anyway, there's lots of things going on around me but I stepped back from it all..and put myself at a standstill.  I decided to do this because I needed to catch up with life, as I have posted before. I have done basically nothing for the past week, nothing but watch some stuff on TV, play video games, sleep, and occasionally talk online.  Things have been so simple and relaxed..it's a nice life. I know, however, that this is temporary, things are about to get crazy again and I cant keep myself out of the loop forever.  School will be starting again in a few weeks, and that means alot will be going on in my life other than studying and class.  Everyone who goes to a decent school knows that college is more about what goes on outside of the classroom: the girls, the beer, the drama..ya thats what college is REALLY about. I really didnt give class my all this semester because I had to deal with breaking up with and going out with the same girl about 4 times(dont say a word..i know what youre thinking..i just dont care), dealing with other girls, sororities and their drama, breaking up with ZBT(reminded me of ending a relationship, scary huh?), that internet job, partying, being depressed and sleeping..you get the idea..not much time for class..BUT..i got a 3.0. If I had the motivation I could tackle harvard :)  So what's in store for me this semester? Well..firstly in class..Databases with Williams. She's the teacher from hell. She has no idea that some comp sci majors actually DO have lives. My first round with Williams was Nonlinear Data Structures. If you're not sure what that means, its OK..don't think too hard. I ended up working on programs for hours upon hours..days upon days..many sleepless nights. Now the sleepless nights I would rather be having include a hot girl in my bed..NOT with a FUCKING COMPUTER. If she overworks me this semester, I'm going to have to kick her fuckin ass. As far as the whole..being fratless thing after I cut my losses with the ZBs...Common sense..once you've been in a frat..you don't want to be fratless until youre done with college and in suits working 9-5 in a big city by day and drinking Chardonnay in a windowed restaurant overlooking the city skyline with a beautiful woman.  oops..back to current reality..Yeah..i want to be a frat boy..a crazy one..and I'll find a home..don't you all worry your little yarmulke's(ya..i think i spelled that right) off.  I'll be greek..i'll be something..you cant expect me to disappear..So whether you loathe me or love me..i'm here to stay for now..till i'm ready to go. So if ya see me..say hi and smile.   Oh and if i ignore you or am quiet..its because i'm trying to get back to my room to SLEEEEEEEEEP :) It's going to be one of those semesters...one of those crazy semesters that you see in college-themed movies, but you don't believe exists.  I can feel it.  Right now looking forward I have everything to gain this semester and nothing at all to lose...I have no responsibilities other than my classes, no real commitments, and a bunch of crazy ass mother fuckers that are sure to keep things interesting..no doubt no doubt.  Well thats enough commentary about whatever..its CHRISTMAS..so..its time to play santa clause and give gifts...So..if youre name is here next to a gift..youre lucky..if it's not here..tough shit, asshole. If youre not below..then its just because I couldnt spontaneously think of something entertaining to write here for you.

For you( yeah you..the person reading this)- Close your eyes real hard and think of what ya want..and for that one second you have it..maybe its only in your mind..but for a second..it was yours. NOW..think of how nice the thought of having it was....Guess what? Thats your motivation to take hold of life...get that one thing ya want..make your life what you want it..play this game, play it well and win. Remember, the world is yours..shape it how you want it. Do what you want..when you want..its your life..Don't you forget it.
