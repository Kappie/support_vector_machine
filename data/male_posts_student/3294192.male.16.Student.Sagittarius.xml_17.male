I woke up really really late, I'm talking like 4:30 in the afternoon, even though I went to bed as soon as I got home last night, at like 11:00 or 12:00. This has thrown off my inner clock considerably, and will probably not be good for getting to sleep at an appropriate time tonight. I vaguely remember waking up to my alarm clock at 7:00 or so, walking across the room, unplugging it, and throwing it out the door into some laundry. Luckily, it was not wounded.  After dragging myself out of bed, I wandered around my empty house for a bit, stopping to set up the wonderfully full-featured  urlLink Thunderbird  on my laptop, and to download some more old school SNES games, like Super Metroid and Mario All Stars. I prefer to use the SNES emulator  urlLink ZSNES , as it has a very simple interface and a nice save-state feuture.  I then considered for a split second the possibility of studying for finals: DENIED.  Jon stopped by around 6:00, and we hung out briefly, talking about Fugazi, The Simpsons, and how everything is nicer in Japan, even their rip-offs.
