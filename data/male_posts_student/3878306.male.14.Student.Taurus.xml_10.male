Today nothing was plannedwhich was good. We ended up goingfor a ride around the car. We went to a lawers office to thank her for getting myuncle papers and got mcdonalds. This Mikki D was new andthe bathrooms were clean. I ate a ten piece chicken mc nugget meal with some lemonade. (Minute Maid of cource). Getting there was a blur since i was sleepy and needed to pee. Anyway when er got back I got on the computer and registerd myself to Ashlee Simpsonswebsite. (She's hot) Mycousins Ihave no clue what they were doing but i was lookingsome sex info on the net. I like this site they give reliable facts and answer guestions. It was  urlLink  www.teenwire.com     . I went downstairs I became a kid again. I played with my cousinsfor a while then my cousin's neighbortold me his computer wasgoing slow. I went there and twicked it alittle to try to fix it. It's a great computerit's just really slow.
