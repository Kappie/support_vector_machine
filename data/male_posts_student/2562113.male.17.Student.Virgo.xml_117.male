That's Albany in a nutshell -- and I miss all of it. Well, maybe not ALL of it -- I sure don't miss shitting every 5 minutes from eating the campus food.  After a two week flirt with freedom, the high schoolers have to go back to their jail cells (NRHS) tomorrow. :::evil laugh::: Don't worry, only 6 more months fellas. Bob and I are coming in Tuesday for Alumni Day, so keep your eyes open for us! That is, if I can wake up before noon...  Until next time,  -BIGsmut.
