My brother and his friend were sitting down at the edge of the platform and my mother was further down, looking at things. I was walking around the platform and I as what looked to be some sort of dam. It was just a built up concrete wall where the water was overflowing. Looking up from this "dam" I saw another platform across the swamp. I was shaped like a Y with two parts jutting out into the swamp. I became fixed on these platforms and trying to get on these platforms. I got everyone to get up and follow me. We started heading back to the entrance. When we headed back, straight up ahead us there was an exit to a busy road. Then the dream jumped to when we were in a parking lot with my dad in the car. I sat in the trunk while everyone else sat in the seats. I could see the entrance to that Y platform from the car, but the car drove off before I could say anything. Then the dream ended.
