       
      Only 28 minutes until Im out of school for the day, and good riddins. I needed a break, its been way to long since I've gotten real rest and today Im going to take full advantage. Actually I probably wont, Ill go home and practice and 5:30 will come way soon and then Ill have to leave again...The story of my life but hey, for whatever reason I get by with less stress then most and with better grades, even with all of my extra-curricular activities, so in turn I'm pretty happy with the way they are...Im content. Until Later CYA
