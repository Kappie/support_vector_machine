It's a very hillarious book, and I've laughed aloud a number of times at the events that have unfolded, and stayed up late at night to finish one more chapter. But as I was reading last night, I found myself striking a comparison between me and the book's main character, Ignatius J. Reilly.  As this summer draws to a close, I find myself looking back at what I've done. I attempted to get a job, but through mishaps and a few of my own blunders, nothing came of it. I had avoided school work at all possible costs, more focused on what I thought to be things that were "intellectually stimulating." I've written a few heavily worded editorials and reflections, drawn for hours on pads of paper that litter my desk and on my computer, and dreamed up theories of grand purpose in the universe; none of these things to ever be seen by anyone but myself. Yet I continue to put off all that is practical and necissary to further my own creative needs.  Ignatius fancies himself an intellectual. A renaissance man born out of his time, and an observer to society. I can't say that I blame him. I often feel that I know far more about what I should be doing and how things are supposed to work than anyone else does, that I've tapped into some fountain of celestial knowledge, enlightening me with the true knowledge of the mysteries of our world. But what do I know? I'm a 17 year old boy with a big vocabulary and lot of time on his hands. Surely, I remain on the same level as others of my age, despite what pompus ideas I have just because "I'm a unique individual."  Still, this feeling of anachronism and self-importance that I have keeps me from doing what needs to be done, and what I now struggle to do, as time runs short for me. I feel as if I am exempt from these rules and regulations, assignments and duties; that my true purpose is to create, and to study, and to be at ease. I must admit, this is only an excuse I have made for myself, that the only obstacle between me and getting my tasks done is myself, and that coming up with these grand, abstract feelings and emotions only hinder my progress of getting my work done.  But at least I'm not fat.  ------------  (edit: I'm using part of this for an essay I'm doing on the book. So if a teacher scans the internet and finds this and tries to give me a 0 for plagerism...it's me, Mendoza. I really wrote this. Please don't fail me. ;_; )
