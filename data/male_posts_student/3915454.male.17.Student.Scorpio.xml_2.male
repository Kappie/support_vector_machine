I am seeing in me now.The things you swore you saw yourself.So tired of the corners of your lips.Part them and feel my finger tips.Trace the moment for forever.Defense is paper thin.Just one touch and I'd be in.Too deep now to ever swim.Against the current.So let me slip away.So let me slip away.So let me slip away.So let me slip against the current.So let me slip away.So let me slip away.So let me slip away.So let me slip away.Vindicated.I am selfish.I am wrong.I am right.I swear I'm right.Swear I knew it all along.And I am flawed.But I am cleaning up so well.I am seeing in me now.The things you swore you saw yourself.My hope dangles on a string.Like slow spinning redemption
