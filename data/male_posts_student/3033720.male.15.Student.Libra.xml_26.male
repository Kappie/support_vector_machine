Anna sent me this little quote of his and I found it so incredibly stupid I had to put it on my blog.   DingoLiberation [7:57 PM]:  so, let me get this straight...you went from an immature kid in your freshmen year, to a wise 16 year old junior, then back to an immature superficial guy that asked for make out sessions that were recorded, then back to what? a wise 16 year old junior whos going to be a senior next year?  ClintonwasSKA [7:58 PM]:  I try not to apply stereotypes, because they are judgments ClintonwasSKA [8:01 PM]:  I just don't try to sum up my thoughts and actions into words ClintonwasSKA [8:01 PM]:  it's unnecessary for me :)   Ok Archie, we can all see you are trying to play the tortured soul. And let me tell you something, I've been there, done that, and you are overdoing it. Not a fun road to go down either. Man, why the hell has everyone I know liked him at some point? It must be his sexy hair......
