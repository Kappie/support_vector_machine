Went into town aprés l'école with my new-found fortune of £7 and purchased... a glasses case, a bottle of pepsi, a chocolate muffin, The Phantom of The Opera by Gaston Leroux and a book called "100 Favourite Poems" or something. Uber-joy.  Day  before tomorrow. What's tomorrow, you ask? My 16th birthday. Tomorrow I can legally go and screw someone. I can also legally get pissed. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeee!  I get the feeling Sally Grant is going to be to me as Clarriwas... don't ask.  Anyway, apparently Miller is obsessed with me. Albeit my blog. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.  Quote de la jour; "I love to see the summer beaming forth And white wool sack clouds sailing to the north"  From John Clare's   Sonnet  In tribute to what may well be this year's last day of sun.  Love, Jon Roskilly
