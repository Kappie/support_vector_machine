Equally frustrating is that there is absolutely nothing cool for small, lightweight guys to do in a show choir show, and they won't let the girls lift me.       In other news, Heather Haywood and I are writing a scene together in Theatre arts about a feminist, an environmentalist, and a communist.  I think you can guess who I'm playing.      Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!
