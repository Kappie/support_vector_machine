The details are pretty sketchy, but I rememmber two parts vividly, whch involved me having sex, in both the inner dream and the outer dream, with someone whom I would never, ever, have thought of like that, in the way that makes you go ewwwww...... Then think, actually... Anyway, I'm not gonna name her cause theirs a good chance she reads my other blog.  In the interior dream I was working with her, Amy *Solenburg, and Cristian on some sort of secret project and she and I got trapped in this garage thing.  We started fighting, and then suddenly we went at each other.  She was just about to take off her bra, when I "woke up" into the next dream.  I was lying curled up in a fetal position and there were other sleeping forms all around me, but I couldn't identify them.  It turns out we were at school, so after everyone else woke up, me, Jenny, The girl, and Sasha *Wee outside a room, and Jenny was like, "I heard you calling out for ___ last night.  Then she was like, "You had a sex dream about me?  That's so awesome!  I had a sex dream about you,"  Then Sasha ran away and hit me for dream-cheating on her.  Then we went into the empty classroom behind us and did the deed for real.  We had our next class together, so we were walking down the halway when I suddenly fell on the ground, but she kept walking.  I crawled to an area full of workmen where the lights were down, it seemed like my backpack weighed more as we got closer.  Then I found out why as it was pulled off of me toward the giant magnet.  That's about when I woke up.
