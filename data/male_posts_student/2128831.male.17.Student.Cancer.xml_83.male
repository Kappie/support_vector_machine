It's not always nice to start your day with destructive thoughts, feelings of conceit, vainess and bitterness. And of thoughts of weakness. I feel weak.  But, I've got an essay to pass in, chapters to read, and work to go to tonight. I like to hide behind these, although they are a priority, my sanctuary.  Fucking hell, I need to get over myself. I like my coffee bitter, bitter, bitter coffee. Anyways, just having a rough day. Ever wonder whether or not you should feel guilty about something? Doesn't it rip you apart? Doesn't the easy route seem to be to accept your bitchy, ill-disposed, malignant traits rather than try to justify the right and the good? Accepting your faults is a warm blanket. It makes things feel okay sometimes. But is it right or is it wrong? Again--anyways. Drink your fucking coffee, bitch. It's time to move on. Just like aspiring to win the endless war. I'm sitting here, drinking my bitter bitter coffee, being a bitter bitter person. Time to move on, you crazy bitch. I have a theory. My theory, though some of you may think I'm stating the obvious, is that a human governing system is only as good as the people in it. What I mean by this is that creating an ideal government, or an ideal self-governing system will not guarantee that no tyranny or injustice will take place. It seems to me that you can create a government that encourages injustice in a society, or one that encourages justice. And perhaps that's really the most you can do.  Let me put it this way, if you were to penalize just actions in a society and reward injustice, you could very well guarantee (and I would site human history to support this assertion) that some people would act immorally. For example let's say your government outlawed dissent in your society, and rewarded those who turned in dissenters. Some people would turn in their friends and neighbors to the government for prosecution, precisely because they would be rewarded for doing so or potentially because it would keep the government at least temporarily from coming after them. Thus by persecuting those who act justly or morally, and rewarding those who do not you would remove from society all those capable of redeeming it. The converse I believe would not necessarily work the same way.  It is possible to create a system of government/self-government that rewards just actions and discourages and/or punishes injustice. I do not believe this would guarantee nor do I believe that you could guarantee that some people would act morally. While it may be likely that some would there would be no way of guaranteeing this outcome. My point is this, you can create an immoral society through government, but you can't create a moral one. Thus creating a self-governing system that should work, will not guarantee that it will work. Why? Because to some degree how well our justice system works is contingent on the rationality of those involved. More precisely since the survival and prosperity of an economy and thus the societies that make it up is contingent on rational action, the success of any justice system that was regulated by the marketplace would be contingent on the rationality of the society that patrons it.  To clear a few things up a bit, since my thoughts seem a little disparate even to me. I am considering all unjust actions to be immoral, and all just actions to be moral. However the terms justice and morality are not interchangeable. On a personal level morality goes far beyond the scope of justice. It has to do with your personal values, and can change from person to person. Justice requires at least two people to exist, and in fact makes it possible for those individuals to coexist in the same society. It pertains explicitly to those rights that must be necessarily protected for a society to exist. For example I can't coexist in a society with those who would choose to murder me. I may for a while if I were ignorant of those who wanted to destroy me, but my destruction would ultimately put a crimp in my plan for continued existence. Finally I am functioning on the presumption that moral action requires rational thought. Thus a million irrational tyrants placed into a market-regulated justice system that was designed to preserve justice, and punish injustice, presuming no others were placed into the same system, would necessarily fail. After all some of those irrational tyrants still have to serve as judge and jury, and though they may be rewarded for acting justly those who insured that the system continued to function as it was designed to would also be irrational tyrants. There's no getting around it. Our systems of justice and governance are dependent on us.   The point of creating a self-governing justice system can never be to create a more moral society, but to keep the government from destroying and/or damaging the morality of the society it governs. I point this out because I think it is important to remember that while we should work to create a better governing system, it will never be a cure for all of our social ills. And that a system that should work, could still fail in spite of our best intentions and efforts.  I am a little down today, so poems are necessary for if you notice I write them when I am really happy or really crappy, lol that rhymes.  So here is some poetry!  Cries that no one hears Tears that pierce the skin Thoughts so cold, warmth is no where Wishes of nonexistence Fears, hopes, and dreams No one knows of Screams on the inside Cries on the outside A wish that could be so easily fulfilled But fear consumes these wishes Drowned with sympathy Such terrible empathy is never felt Screams indulged in silver Released in such hatred and despise Everything's fixed the same way No matter how hard he tries  He needs this to survive He pretends everything’s okay But he's such a horrible actor he deserves no Oscar For he’s failed once again And maybe this time he'll fade away Fade away into nothing  A person compiled of glass A person who shatters ever so freely Composed of beautiful notes But a song no one would ever hear Silent screams Endless nights Fits of rage That end in cries A soul made of liquid A person made of glass Such a horrific combination Yet no one attempts to fix it A partnership so fatal But no one realizes it  Until it’s too late
