The place is truly brilliant, it's SO where I'm going to do my X'mas shopping and also where I'm going to spend my Birthday money if I get enough to cover 50% of my X'mas bill from it... I really do make a fuss about my finances, but that's probably because I don't have any :P. The bullring was kind of cool, I got the impression from the Radio adverts that it was like a street marker, but I couldn't have been more mistaken, I really have got to check out the TopMan branch up top. I also really have to stop being so gay. lol I've fallen in love with this one shop,  urlLink Muji , and after finishing this post I will be checking out there website!! I also have fallen for the "proper" Oasis Shop, the one with all the Gothic clothes and the mass collection of posters - not ONE with Johhny Depp in by the way lover, I was APPALED!.  However, the best thing about today was the fact that I managed to survive of Â£5!!  Anyway, I have to be going because I can't think ofa nything else exciting to write about... Have fun!
