That also means three more months to the end of secondary school.      I for one went to receive a certificate of thanks from the school for my contribution to the Boys Brigade just the day before. But I feel that each and every single one should receive thanks, as eveyone has contributed to the school in one form or another.      Most of you will deny it, but deep in your hearts you are grateful to the school for nurturing you to adulthood.    And with adulthood comes realization. Innocent hopes of a primary school kid have been extinguished with grim reality.      Hatred has been born, some lasting four years.     However, a part of our lives is going to end soon and a new beginning await each and everyone of us next year.    That is why I urge those that have a hatred, dislike or rivalry for someone else to make up and resolve your differences... Even if you think that person doesn't deserve it.    A new beginning will ensue and old hatred's should be forgiven...if not forgotten...
