With all my heart  with all my heart with all my mind with all my strength i am gonna serve you everyday, in all my ways i gonna praise, praise you forever  even when troubles come into my life i will not fear cos i noe u are close by there's not a mountain that i cannot climb with you, with you  standing here now  with my mind and emotion  i make a vow to give all my devotion all my desires i place u above u are my God, u are my very 1st love...   used to tink that online blogs are stupid... but i guess i am wrong again... i guess thats all for now... feel better after telling someone... oops something... haha watever it is feel better after i let it all out...
