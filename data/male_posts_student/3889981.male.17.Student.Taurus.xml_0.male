Flakes of brown parchment flitted in the soft breeze that circulated the room, as creases, some a darker shade of yellow, others dark brown, appeared where they had not been before. The hand opened, veins showing clearly in skin wrapped so thinly over bone that sometimes there was more white than pale that could be seen, and the paper whisked upwards and around the room haphazardly, most guided by the wind, but leaving behind the core of what is dancing above the palm of the hand. It was no longer just one piece of paper as the message had come to him, nor merely just the random bits of paper that broke off with age, but the shape and size of each separate bit of paper that floated above his palm had a specific way that it blew in the wind, all in all presenting a very different message than that had been written.   Janadas.   The name had not been spoken, not least for the last century since the old man had lived in the room. Neither had he been disturbed, for the age-old enchantment on an elliptical, reflective rune sitting on its obsidian pedestal in the middle of its study prevented anybody from intruding upon his privacy. He frowned, unhappy with the casual way he had been addressed, inferring the disrespect that came with the name. The frown did not do much than add its own creases to the already wrinkled with age skin, as the wizard’s eyes gleamed with the yellow light characteristic of all powerful wizards who have approached their Prime, the time period where the ability manifested itself to its maximum, still with as much intensity as they were decades ago. Even the slightest apprentice failed to lose his power with age, except the physical sense of spell casting, but for the old man the eyes were the only features he had managed to retain from his youth.  The papers danced their message above his palm, continuing its magical relaying as he made out the words in the dim light. The grotesque stump of beeswax candle burned faintly, its meager flame flickered and guttered, leaving acrobats of shadow where its light did not reach. The faint glow left much to be desired in the way of light for a commoner, yet he had long grown accustomed to the dim settings. The weak glow illuminated the archmage’s study, his arcane sanctuary. Tomes of unspoken power, bound with all sorts of hide, even human, adorned the rows upon rows of shelves that lined the circular room. The shelves were a wonder by themselves, their exquisite workmanship evident in the failing light, where magical designs prevented the wrong hands from getting to the shelves without permission. All that, and much more, had been acquired during the great mage’s adventuring days. Now he lived sequestered deep in his tower where young aspiring magi came for tutelage. Powerful magics had been drawn in the construction of the tower, for the blocks of black granite that had been hewn from the mountain face of the Daishain Mountains a thousand miles away had been carried with an unerring precision that outdid any mortal’s work, as arcane glyphs and sigils engraved upon the impregnable stone walls interweaved and twined together, forming intricate designs that defied the eye, making even the finest lace seem drab. Even a century after its construction, the tower still prickled with fey energies from the residue of its making.  The man focused his eyes, the yellow gleam still undiminished with age, upon the bits of parchment that still danced their message. His initial irritation was soon smoothed over as the message unfurled its contents. The frown dissipated, leaving only the wrinkles of age, as his facial muscles twitched in a smile. Excitement added its own gleam to the magical yellowness in his eyes, an emotion so seldom associated with the man even in his younger days, but he could have been a different man then, as he nodded his head in what seemed like agreement.  As the final word played itself out, the man threw his head back and roared in maniacal laughter, the sound traveling through the entrance to his study, past the enchanted arch that served as the trans-dimensional walkway, bouncing off the walls yet never reducing its magnitude, where startled servants dropped pots and apprentices glanced out their quarters cautiously, wondering what monster had been the source of that laugh. Other acclaimed wizards looked in the direction of the laughter with puzzled expressions, wondering if he had finally gone mad, although that could not have been technically true as he was already half mad at best.
