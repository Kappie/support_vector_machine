I'm not saying this is a bad thing, nor am I saying I haven't worried about it, I just dont worry about it as much as others do. While others are trying to score some beer or some weed, I'm trying to score some political insight. While others are trying to get some sex, I'm trying to get my views across in anyway possible. I'm different, there's no doubt about it. The state of American youth these days is sad, almost sickening. I am one of the few, one of the different, one of the proud, I actually know who's running this country, and I also know how to think for myself. In this speech I will touch on the Liberal bias in the media and high schools, and the effect it has on the American Youth, as well as other subjects. I have bitten my tongue until its bled, I have held back my views, and now I'm done, so prepare to be slapped in the face with the 2x4 that IS reality. 	Most people that know me know me as an energetic and spontanious teenager, always up to try something new and always willing to listen. There are few, though, that know the political and insightful side of me. I save this for when it is needed, there is a time and a place for that, and personally I don't think school is one of them. School should be a place for students to go to learn about the basic fundementals of life, and how they will need them later in life, not a place of political indoctorine. Go to any college in America and find a conservative student, chances are that they will tell you that there is a huge, almost sickening, liberal bias in American colleges, mainly in English, Journalism, and Literature departments.Now I could go on and on and on with accusations and other things of that sort, but thats not going to do anything except make me look like a, well, a liberal. So here's some fun little facts brought to you by 20 year old UCLA Senior, and nationally syndicated writer Ben Shepario:  Seventy-nine percent of college professors feel that George W. Bush is too conservative. Forty percent of college professors are in favor of slavery reparations. Sixty-five percent are against tax cuts. Nope...no bias here. 	 This goes for High Schools too, and small High Schools such as Douglas High School are not exempt. Early in the first Semester, I was sitting in English one day, when our teacher said "Ok Kids lets get our books out and read!" Now, I am a very sarcastic person as many of you know, so I leaned over to my friend and said "I can't read, the Commies have invaded my mind." I didn't even think she could hear, but apparently she did. This is were it gets interesting. Next thing I know our teacher is flying off the handle, so to speak. After a few sputtered sentence fragments and and other various noises she says to me "Cathan, I want you to do a report on Communist Olympic gold medalists, Scientists and Nobel Peace Prize Winners!" Now most students would have been a little angry at this, but like I said, I'm different. I was all but jumping up and down with joy. Now, I would absolutly LOVE to share every little piece of information I found for that report, but I'm on a time limit here, so I'll just give you a few tid bits. Anyway, I'll just skip down to Nobel Peace Prize winners...mainly because this is where the best line in the entire report was. After extensive research about nobel peace prize winners, I only found ONE that was communist. I'll just read to you what I wrote at the end of that. It read, and I quote "So, as you can see, there was one Soviet scientist who won the nobel peace prize, count them again, ONE!"  	American teens...probably one of the saddest age groups this day and age. Most are too busy trying to get laid, and scoring weed and beer to care about what's going on in there country. Few have morals, and the ones that do are called wimps, prudes, and squares. This, if you ask me, is happening because of the even sadder state of American television. I am in no way for censorship of any kind, but some people should have some decency. Movies and TV shows are nothing but violence, sex, violence, sex,I've seen very few shows that have any kind of positive message in them, but there are some. It's horrible that teens don't think for themselves, going off of what they hear and see on TV and radio, both Liberally charged. I have a message for my peers: Listen to Rush Limbaugh!!! The man is a GENIUS, he is the Silent Majorities (Conservatives) voice in the media, his is reason, he is logic, he knows all! Think for yourselves is what I say to America's youth, but always agree with Rush Limbaugh.  	For those of you who say there is no Bias in the media...you need to come out of whatever drug-induced coma you've been in. There was a Pro-America, Pro-Democracy rally in Iraq where hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions, of Iraqies came showed support for us, but did you hear about THAT on CNN? How bout MSNBC? Guess where I heard it? No, not Fox News..even THEY didn't show it. I read it on the INTERNET at a conservative news site Newsmax.com. Now think about all the Anti-American protests we've seen on the air...there have been ton's, but the ONE Pro-American rally there is, the media is silent. But hey, there's no Liberal bias in American Media, right? HAH! For every protest against America there is, I'm willing to bet theres 3-4 Pro-American ones, but what could I know. 	Now I just mentioned the Liberal Bias in the media, and mostly talked about the news, in this part of my speech I'm going to talk to you about Americas music industry, Punk music in peticular. I chose punk mainly because that is what I listen to, and I have noticed with bands such as NOFX and Anti-Flag, all they are doing is pushing a one track thought system in the punk scene, something that the scene has been fighting since the beginning. They think that anyone who is proud to be American is automatically a Fascist, take this line on how the band Anti-Flag go their name; it has been edited so it is appropriate for the young children in the audience: "The name was originally inspired as a result of the late 80's Pittsburgh scene being infiltrated by a bunch of ass holes who toted the slogan, "Freedom not fascism". Well, that would've been great if these jerks practiced what they preached, but unfortunately, their idea of punk rock was VERY fascist! They took to sporting the American flag on their jackets, and saying the pledge of allegiance to the flag." So, according to these Liberals...Wearing an American flag and saying the pledge makes you a Fascist. Well folks, in that case I guess I'd better change my name to Benito Mussolini because I certainly qualify for their type of Fascism. There's a place where these bottom-feeders go to talk about how its all the a Vast Right Wing Conspiracy...this place is called Punk Voter. To these people, every single solitary problem in the world is at the fault of America. Gas prices America's fault, Mumia Abu Jamal killing a cop in cold blood...conspiracy of the CIA. 	There are exceptions to the Liberal Rule in punk. Bands like Down By Law, The Dickies, and, my personal favorite, The Dropkick Murphys are all conservatives. If you don't believe me here are some Dropkick lyrics from the chorus of Front Seat: We'll take the front seat mister, and we're never gonna take the back, we'll take the front seat, mister, liberal scum to the back. If you ask me any band that mentions the words "Liberal scum" is alright by me! And here, a line or two from their biography: You can preach till you're blue in the face but if you're lying in the gutter no one's gonna listen. If you pick yourself up by the bootstraps and live your life to the best of your ability you may set an example that others will follow. Key words in that right there...Self-Improvement. Liberals don't believe in SELF-improvement, they believe that the government should improve you because to them your to stupid to do it yourself. You don't know whats good for you, because your just an idiotic subhuman, so let US make your life decisions for you, thats Liberal thinking for you.  	Now, through out this speech I have made it clear where I stand politically and I certainly hope I have helped you find out where you personally stand. One of the main goals I had in reading this speech is to educate, I want you, the audience, to know that there is a huge difference between what is happening in the world and what we as Americans are being told. We are told that the entire world hates us, that we are despised internationally. All I can say to the people who say this is, who cares? We're America, we are easily one of the most prosperous, and freest nations in the world, and thats how it is whether you want to admit it or not. They say France is right, my friend, again who cares what France says. All I can say about that arguement is that I'd much rather live poverty stricken in America, then be the president of France. I would like to leave you with a quote by a great man, Winston Churchill. "If a man is not a Liberal in his youth, he has no heart, if not a conservative in his adulthood, he has no brain." Some of you maybe asking "Whitey, does that mean you have no heart?" And the answer to that is no, it doesnt mean i have no heart, it just means that I developed a brain a lot faster then some. Thank you, and good evening.
