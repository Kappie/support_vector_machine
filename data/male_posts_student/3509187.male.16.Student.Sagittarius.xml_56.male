This got us wondering if she will have the ScanTron programed to accept the right answer or her answer will be on the Final... Erg...  So today it was Chad, Angela D, Stosh, Michael C, Becky, and I at Panera.  Chad's  car  only fits 5 and despite Stosh's willingness to ride in the trunk, we decided it would be best for soemone to walk... Angela volunteered and I, being the nice guy I am, said I'd walk with her so she wasn't alone... Chad had to stop for gas, so we all got to Panera at about the same time. We started off well, going over one of the tests, but then some of us got some food and nothing much happened while we ate, and after that we didn't do a whole lot of work, but it was ok cause we were really just rechecking ourselves and we have tomorrow inclass to work on it.   We decided to bash Wade a bit cause it just fit so well... and we found that she had answered differently for the same question for the two class represented at todays study session. It was like 5:30 when we finally finished and I finally got home around 6ish... I'd have to say it was a fun day.  I'm hoping more fun stuff will being happening this summer and such.  Well lets see, I guess it time for the sad news... if you don't like sad news skip this part I will tell you when its safe to read again...  Today my Grandfather passed away... odd way to say it.. Its sad because I will miss him and everything, but I don't believe it is a horrible thing because he was 92, lived a full life, did what he wanted to do, and as far as I could tell had fun to the end.  He was definately an awesome grandfather... and as much as it seemed to be approaching, it was a surpise... Pray for him if you do that. thanks  OK SAVE TO READ THE SAD NEWS IT OVER...  Well I guess that it for now... I may be doing another one of those "profiles of a friend" (like the one of Robin and Angela)  -Dan V  P.S. Sorry about not having any Pictures for today's session...
