Rachel came running into my room to tell me to pick up the phone that was ringing. By the time I rolled over and got to the top of the stairs the phone stopped so I trudged my way back to bed only to lay there for a couple of minutes. I didn't hear much of Riley for the first half hour or so. Rachel had her up in mom's bedroom and they were watching TV. I stayed downstairs.  Reid had drums at like 10:30 so mom was coming home to pick him up. Here's where we had our major problem of the day. I'm going to describe it exactly as it happened. I decided to play a video game. No one was around because Rach was upstairs with Riley and Reid was eating breakfast. It seemed a perfect time to play the gamecube and I saw nothing wrong with it. So, I'm sitting there minding my own business, having fun when Reid goes over to the front door and opens it. "Reid why do you need the front door open?" "Mom will be home soon so I'm just gonna leave it open so I'll be ready to walk out." I said okay and continued with what I was doing. I didn't really care. The door open didn't bother me too much. But it DID bother Rachel. She came down at that EXACT moment and this was where things got ugly. You have to understand. Rachel and Reid are like the cat and dog in the house. They don't get along whatsoever. WHATSOVER! So, naturally, she had an objection to Reid opening the door.  "Someone could just walk right into the house Reid! Mom wants the door closed!" Reid fired back, "Rachel! It's only 10 minutes mom will be open soon." I sat minding my own business, twidling my thumbs, which was my one big error. There was something I should have done but didn't. It may sound silly, it may sound adultish, but I should have sent them to their rooms. It works every time yet why didn't I think of this them?? To sum it up, the door opened and closed about 6 or 7 times. Reid opened it. Rachel closed it. Reid opened it. Rachel closed it. On and on and on it went and meanwhile I'm going back and forth between sides trying to get one of them to give in. Of course that's impossible though. They don't give in. It came down to Reid losing his temper and pining Rachel against the wall. He yelled in her face and went all "animal" like on her. Man, I can so see this kid getting into trouble. He loses his temper and it's not pretty. Rachel started crying and came over to me telling me to do something. Riley sat and took it all in. I sat and played my game. WRONG MOVE! Ironically, mom called at that moment and they both yelled what happend over the phone. That's when I knew it was GAME OVER for me. Sure enough, I got it from mom. Yes. I bow my head in shame but I think I learned my lesson. When in doubt, send them to their room.  So, that was the "meat" of the day. We ran to the credit union and went over to Nana's. Mom and Dad were going to this Titanic Exabition thingy so we stayed at Nana's. We was my favorite dinner, spaghetti and meatballs. I reserved my copy of Pendragon #5 at Barnes and Noble so I'm gonna go get it tomorrow. I watched Big Brother at 9 even though I had to miss the first 20 minutes of it on the way home from nana's. I got gymnastics tomorrow too.  Well, I'm done now for the night. I'll be writing again tomorrow. I'm starting to like this blog. It's funny because I'm slowly growing accustomed to it. I didn't think I would continue it at first.  But now, I think it's safe to say that you will be seeing a lot more blog from me from now on. Life canonly gets more interesting from here.
