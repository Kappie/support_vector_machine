Today is my first day off on summer break (wee!). It isnt really that great because i've miserably failed the grade, due to me missing somewhere around 50 days during the year. Personally, i'm just pretty glad to be wasting more time on the computer. Mindlessly staring at the glow of the monitor during ungodly hours of the night. Ahh, my sweet addiction.  Oddly, I didnt sleep in today. I woke up at fucking 6 and couldnt go back to sleep. I'm pretty tired now but theres better stuff to do than sleep at the moment. The first thing I did was start up the computer (naturally) and check out my favorite forums at  urlLink Animeleague.net .Nothing that new or exciting was going on there, so I hopped over to GameFAQs and voted on the poll. Since there wasn't shit to do anywhere and Kazaa was being a bitch like always, I decided to play some Ragnarok. After a few monotonous hours of killing creatures as a cute little swordsman sprite, I cut off the game and called up Rea (my close friend) as I promised her I would. We talked for 30 minutes then she went to go get some lunch. After screwing around back on the internet, I got the inspiration to start up my blog... and here I am.
