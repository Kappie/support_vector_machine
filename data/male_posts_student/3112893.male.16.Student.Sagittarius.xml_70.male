The intersection nearest my house also happens to be one of the intersections at which the bus stops, which is nice because it means that I only have to walk about 300 feet from my door to catch the bus. However, the pedestrian crossing button thing is set up at that intersection, like most of the boston stop lights, pedestrian-centrically. It works such that if any one person hits the buttom to cross from any "corner"(sometimes there are more than two streets running through the intersection and sometimes it's not perfectly perpendicular and you end up with 5 places to stand, and just stuff like that.) of the intersection, it turns ALL the lights for the cars red and ALL of the lights for pedestrians to walk. This wouldn't be so bad though if the intersection near where I lived didn't have such high traffic. Whenever I need to cross the street, I end up stopping all the traffic and creating a long line of cars and everyone looks at ME so it feels really awkward. Anyway, I feel this urge to smile I guess because I feel kinda bad for stopping everyone and I'm embarrassed by my own arrogance... Even though it's not really  my  arrogance, it just feels that way. Anyway, I have nothing more to say and I feel now like I've wasted people's time... Yet again :-\.  That is all. -- Feanor
