I have been really busy with work, and friends, and college searches, and what not. I am back though! I am working on a new poll and a new site design among other things. I am working on getting my car fixed up, but adding a new sound system from Meghan's friend Samik (I think that is how you spell his name) for like $200. I just hope I don't fuck it up or something. LOL. I didn't know owning a car would be so expensive. I have spent $230.75 on gas for my car alone since June 13. That is a lot of money, but my car does get 23.43 mpg, or atleast that is the latest one. I use VegasGasPrices.com to keep track of how much I spend and stuff like that. It is pretty cool when you think about it.    Anton and I went to First Flight yesterday to look at stuff we are going to need to by for flight lessons next year, and we met a really cool guy (and hot at that) named Shawn. He went to Rancho and graduated in 2002. He took us out to their new Diamond Star. It has an all glass cockpit. It only has 38 hours on it, TOTAL! It smells like a brand new car. It was so cool. I am going to go there and have Shawn be my instructor or my IR (Instrument Rating) training.  Speaking of which, I need to go get my physical, and take my FAA written test. That should be an adventure. Well I am going to go. I will post more often, I promise, even if it is a Voice Post here and there.
