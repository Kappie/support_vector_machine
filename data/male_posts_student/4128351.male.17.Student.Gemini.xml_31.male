To read my prior ruminations, go here:   urlLink  www.livejournal.com/~elliottjones       Alright, back to recording the accounts of my life as I biasely see them.   I woke up at noon and made a pizza-sandwich (another sandwich I've pioneered).  Then, I got dressed and went to work; man, what a mistake.  I did slave labor for 5 hours and made the same amount of money my little brother makes mowing a lawn in a half-hour.  Bullshit.        Right now I'm currently "grounded" for not coming home on time from Jami's last night.  I don't care, other than not getting to see her.  She could drive out here, but I don't think she wants to do that.  Plus, I don't want her to wreck or something.  I love her.      I'm going to go get Jamin and my guitar and then Dustin and Tory will come out here.  We'll all pretend like we're best friends when, in reality, we're not.  It's funny.        I'm going to go get a shower or something and scrounge to find a bite to eat.        What a way to start off this blog, with nothing exciting.  I'm sorry, I've been in a state of nirvana these last two weeks.  I feel like I've experienced more love in the last two weeks than I have in the previous seventeen years.  It's amazing, she's amazing.  I love her more than life.        I'm heading out, thanks for reading.        Also, today's Song to Illegally Steal off Kazaa: "The Stone" by Dave Matthews Band.      "I was just wandering if you'd come along.  Tell... me... you... will..."        Keep cool my babies.
