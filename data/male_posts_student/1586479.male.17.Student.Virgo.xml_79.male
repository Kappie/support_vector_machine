I want to correct that misconception. Girls can be geeks, most definitely. It just so happens that the general idea of a geek is a mid-puberal fat boy with coke bottle glasses, acne, and a sweater vest. Geeks can be 'cool'. And girls. Hah.  I just realized this is utterly useless and not worth my time or yours.
