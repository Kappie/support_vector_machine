Have one hell of a sore arm today though cos the wing chun pole is basically a small tree without the branches and its really heavy.    There's a programme on in a bit about child prodigies: i am going to scoff at them for not having the full rich life that i have.  Yeah they may be able to speak 16 languages but they havent got.... .a.. . . .. fishing licence have they? the poor fools.   I got tricked into buying loads of food yesterday.  I went into a subway sandwich shop (i'm not proud of it, but i was hungry) didnt know what i was doing and so when the woman asked "would you like a larger sandwich" i thought she meant a bit bigger, like they do in other fast food places, but what she actually meant to say was "you know this sandwich you are already ordering, which to be fair is already quite oversized, would you like to double the size of it to the point where it is in fact shocking".  I would have declined that, but instead i had to gorge on a huge amount of bread and salad.   so go and spread the word.  Subway is a large boat full of goat testicles.
