She then ceased all communication with me for a week...it turned out she had fallen sick for that period of time, and was waitin for my sms, which never arrived due to the fault of Singtel.   This time, we've fallen into another drought. I havent spoken to or messaged her for weeks. Of course, now i feel nonchalent about it. My heart has fully geared towards my studies, perhaps due to surrounding incidents and my own incitement. Nothing provides a safer rate of returns. I reap what i sow. Strange that i've been reminiscing abt my ex-deputy headmaster's famous sayings. I've gained back a longlost part of my heart, and emerged stronger, seasoned from the chase. It has been a refreshing experience. She must feel the same.    Now...i've deleted her hp no., plus peifen's home no. as well. There. No more silly distractions from my studies. Serve me right.    King Pellinore's after the Questing Beast  that gallops like the wind, in fog and mist.  The brachet follows after, yelping  with its tongue out, panting  and its furry tail, wagging  and the fewmets lie hiddento hint a tryst.   Sir Sebas's after the elusive distinctions  offered by thy Cambridge examinations.  Loud radio andcaffeine come along  to helpkeep vigil all night long  yet remnant thoughtsafflictforlorn  on yonder heart,...oh how it stings and burns!   D'ye ken meburdened with heavy heart,  D'ye ask ruefully,'howthou art?'  Oh, Ay'm obliged to say,  'Naw, my sprits are gay.'  yet in my mind Ay lay  ina lonely dream, in Joyous Garde.
