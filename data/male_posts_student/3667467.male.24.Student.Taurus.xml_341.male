I couldn't even order a sandwich right ("The Number Four", sadly). During the ride we tried speaking in French, mostly mocking the Quebecois, but when we arrived we were des stupides. Je regrete, les Quebecois, mon mal. Then we stopped at the Burger King Motel, which is a real Burger King with a real Motel. We wondered if it had room service, which would have been awesome. Instead of mints, they could have left little ketchup packets on our pillows! Or as the Canadians would say, catsup packets.
