If I wanted sympathy then I would be more forward with my emotions and tell everyone  exactly  how I feel. Ofcourse she doesn't know any of this and so I shouldn't really blame her but I hate it when people assume things so quickly. Worst of about her I think I've find myself being attracted to her, ofcourse I could never like her like I did Alyssa, I'd never allow myself but nevertheless I'm still human and I can't help but look at her no matter how much I know I betray my heart by doing so.
