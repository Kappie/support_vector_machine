I live in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, a small island in the middle of the Carribean, home of Sammy Sosa (famous Baseball Player) and other international sports player. I'll be 15 on August 4th while on school vacation (Babeque Secundaria, a private school since good education is not free) one of the best down here. Life in Santo Domingo is pretty cool, we get to hang out at many places most kids our age in other places of the world can't :D, such as bars,pubs, discos (or discotecas as we call them here). Night Life is very active here, you can go out ever since you become a teenager up until you're like really old. We just keep partying all night long :P...   We'll I gotta go because it's 10:30 and since there's no electicity they're gonna turn the  urlLink "planta"  off.
