Last time I wrote this,I put my dictionary on my right hand. But today,I don't have it. SO,I can't use difficult words.hello? how are you?  KON NICHI WA? OGENKI DESU KA?  Recently I sometimes watch soccor games. I watchedJapan vs Thailand yesterday,and Japan vs Australia today. First one was held in China. That is Asia charmpionshi games. There were something that I couldn't beleive about that game. I (and perhaps many Japanese who watched that game) thought that Chinese must be stupid.  They might hate us Japanese. Because we had a war about 60 years ago. Chinese goverment use it. It wants people to hate Japanese in order to avoid complaining to it. I don't say "I can't understand it".But...  I've heard about Hooligan. They are cheering their national team or something. They may behave violently,when there favorite team lose. But,they won't go to the studium to make some booing.  Why do they do that? Is it fun? I never think so. NO WAY? SHIKATA NAI? Even if you say that,I think "they must be stupid!" CHINA HA BAKA NI CHIGAI NAI!
