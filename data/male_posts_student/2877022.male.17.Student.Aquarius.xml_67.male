AIYA i think i may not pon too now. heard that there will be   FIREWORKS  ! so quite a nice sight right? oh yeah can't wait for this weeks CIP then can see the fireworks. so  PRETTY ! okay yes i know cheap thrill. nvm =      anyway no one ever updates anymore man. as i have mentioned without fail in my previous entries. however, i just realised that quite alot of class people read this but they never ever write anything. one good example is HERMAWAN. oh and WEE SIANG. hahha i am not stupid. contary to popular belief. because i have  bionic ears  la. hahha i am like insulting myself.. i am so going crazy.      shall leave before i spout more crap.
