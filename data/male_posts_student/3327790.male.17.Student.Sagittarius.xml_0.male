But *shrugs* that's not such a big deal. I guess I'm just falling into a stage where I'm feeling lonely again.and in a way, spiritually dry. I need my own little revival. I guess I'll get it when I on that Ormond Trip. When I get like this, I'm just crying on the inside and I want nothing more than for Jesus to come back right then and take me to Heaven, because I'm growing tired of the world and all its false pretenses, its false teachings and most of all its apparent intolerance of Christianity. I say that because now it seems I'm getting attacked left and right because of my faith. No, I didn't expect it not to happen, but even though I try not to let it bother me, it can be depressing.  I missed church again... I don't remember the last time I went... and I'm getting sick of not going. I guess in a way its my own fault, I shouldn't rely on my parents to get everyone up and go, its about time I did some things for myself anyways.  *sighs* Well I'm going to go, thanks for reading. As always, God bless and keep you all. Byebye.
