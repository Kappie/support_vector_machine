In today's political climate it seems like uttering those four words is social suicide.  People are aghast and look at you like you just told them that you have and continue to support the Nazi Party.  Call me crazy, but we live in America.  One of the greatest things about this country (for better or worse) is that we are a melting pot of ideas.  My insane notion that the President is doing a good job doesn't seem to fit.  The worst part of it is that people in a miscalculated way to write the President off, call him stupid.  "Oh that man...he is too dumb to be president".  This is the kind of haughtiness that I expect from liberals, but now it is coming from people who would not be otherwise classified as a liberal.  Calling the President stupid has been going on for decades, but what the President does is more a political strategy if anything else.  He talks plainly, something that the liberal establishment hates.  They wanted a nuancer like Kerry--someone with five answers to every problem.  In a recent Time mag article, a column described Kerry has too smart to beat Bush.  Huh?  My question is who is smarter?  The smart guy or the smart guy who plays dumb to win?  The bottom line is something I said before.  People just don't like Bush.  Not for any policy reasons.  They just don't like him and that is not a proven way to unseat an incumbent.  Hate is not a motivating political factor.  Just ask Howard Dean...
