Actually, the break's done very little for my health but seemingly wonders for my mental state... the Tobin and Libby pairing have both been really nice, Scott phoned to see how I was... people are nice. I'm still confused and everything... but by tomorrow... I think the question is how I'm going to be feeling tomorrow. I'm fine now, but will that last? Hell no, but it's nice to be not unhappy once every couple of weeks.  I hate not eating chocolate! Seriously. I have Â£1.50, which would buy a 100g bar of Galaxy and a Galaxy Ripple. There's a pack of Mini Eggs downstairs. Ohoh, but I have found what seem to be a decent replacement - Mont Blancs. They're vanilla-type biscuits, and they're tasty. Slightly bland, but that's as a result of them being Italian (for some reason the Italians seem to not like strong flavours, possibly why they invented most types of pasta). But yes, a possible solution to the problem.  My trombone practice didn't, in all actuality, go brilliantly, but it's not too bad... I don't know. I'm going to get a distinction, honest... I won't be satisfied with anything else. I WILL get a distinction.  Haven't talked to Laura or Fi tonight, or Nikky (though talking to Nikky 2 nights in a row is an immense rarity, it seems). I'm sleepy, ill... and yes, I'm feeling alone, but the world's not too bad.
