It feels good to have a mental road  map for once, sort of like being prepared with food for an long storm. The agenda is as follows.   1 day from now:  Singing someone else's song on Floods Hill.  1 month from now:  I'll be sitting in my film class with Boris G.  2 months from now:  I'll be up in Maine building a house, or just relaxing. The awesome type of relaxation that I can achieve nowhere else.  3 months from now:  Start up my junior year at CHS, and hopefully get into all the classes I wanted, allowing me to enjoy my education.  4 months from now:  Applying to college, like I'm some big tough educated citizen.  6 months and 6 days from now:  Passing my road test and receiving my restricted license.  [records lost....]   12 months from now:  Claiming I have it all figured out.  So yeah, hopefully nothing in that plan goes  too wrong , and hopefully I survive through the murky second six months.  I went to see  urlLink khantra  with Goldy and Jon today, and it was a really good show I think. Some of the bands weren't that note worthy, but I got to hear  urlLink Gotlieb  and really enjoyed them. Time was running short quick, but the boys of Khantra were still able to pull off an amazing set as per usual. I so wish that I could see them play more often. Luckily, I get to see the once in a lifetime live performance of  urlLink Insouciant  tomorrow, and am ready to be blown so far away. We're also planning a cool little lunch for their band and ours at Jon's. So much fun will be had, which is why I'm going to go to bed now, and rest up. If you want to see us play, we'll be on sometime between 1:00 and 4:00 PM, followed immediately by the incredible Insouciant, so be sure to stop by.
