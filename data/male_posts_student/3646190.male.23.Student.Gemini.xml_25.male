She was telling me how isolated he feels from Indian folks right now and how he feels he is wasting his time in everything he is doing. We talked for a long time and I just listened. I was kind of surprised but more worried then anything else. I have been where he is at and it is not a particularly fun place. I need to talk to him and understand exactly what is happening.   It is strange... everything that is happening as if the Indian community is drawing me in, but this time by the call for struggle...   -------------------   Lots of anxiety today.. thinking about my brother, about my mom, and...   I was reading a piece from "Our Feet Walk the Sky," and it made me sad because it was about a wedding and it was clear the importance of a mother in such an event. I wish Mom could come back even for a day or two take part in my wedding or my brothers, but she will never do that. I miss her so much. She really kept the family together and she was really strong. I could wish so many things right now that I did when she was alive, but it is too late. It makes me sad knowing that I will have to spend the rest of my life without her.   I have been clouded with alot of emotions lately, but have forced them down because I have my pamphlet due at the end of August and there is tons of works that still needs to be done. I can't spend time away from political work like I did in June. It is hard. Sometimes it feels like someone is rubbing sandpaper on my heart and soul and I just have to grind my teeth and bear and go through with the work that needs to be done.   I dont know what kind of person will result from that kind of self-torture. I imagine it is not a healthy or good process, but I really do not see a way out.   Everything inside my head is a jumbledmess. I cant even write my thoughts down very clearly...The only time I can focus is on political work and it takes an iron will to do that.............. ...   Working on this pamphlet with a focus on patriarchy has been very difficult. So many painful memories that are close to the heart are surfacing, but I feel my best political writing is coming out of that pain and I owe it to so many young Desis and Muslims whom it might help... There is a part of me that cannot wait for it to be done. I do not know if I have the strength... to do this pamphlet... I can only pray to God that he/she grants it to me...
