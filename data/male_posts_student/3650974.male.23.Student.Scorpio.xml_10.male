I just got done with a six hour session with James, Sarah, and Kyros, follow-up to a ten hour session last weekend. And I still want to play more.  The game works like this: each of the four players controls a different Link. You travel through a series of very Zelda-like dungeons, eight worlds of three areas each. The gimmick is that you have to use GameBoy Advances to control the game. Most of the time, you're all on screen, but when you go into a house or cave, the display switches down to the GameBoy screen, so each player is potentially seeing something different. The four of you have to cooperate to solve various puzzles and defeat enemies. But, the designers also added "force", tiny gems that determine points at round's end, in order to encourage a bit of competitiveness as well.  If you're a fan of the Zelda series like I am, then there's an orgy of things to enjoy here. The story is from Oracle of Seasons/Ages, the world map is from Ocarina of Time, the dungeons resemble Link to the Past, and many of the bosses are taken from Wind Waker. It's like they threw everything great about Zelda into a pot, stirred, and got back something even better.  So yeah, it's a amazingly fun game, even if James is a  urlLink dirty, gem-guzzling whore . These are the sorts of things you just have to put up with in life.
