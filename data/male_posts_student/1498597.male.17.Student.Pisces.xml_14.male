I mean like...hmm...I guess there isn't really any exact way to descirbe it, but lately our city of  Riverside  has been hit by a sudden heat wave.  Which reminds me...and this is proof of how forgetful I am.  When I get home from school, I usually warm up leftovers or somethin' to eat.  Well, I kinda got occupied with somethin' while heatin' some steak up and I think I mighta nearly burned the house down if I didn't smell anythin'!  It took me a little while to catch on because I thought it was the chicken I threw in the microwave oven or somethin'.  But it wasn't, and luckily I turned of the stove and the steak was savageable and not burned beyond recognition.  Anyway, I'll tell you more about my (our) day sometime later.  But for now...see ya!
