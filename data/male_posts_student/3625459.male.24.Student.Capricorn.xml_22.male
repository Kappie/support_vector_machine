Maybe it is asking too much ... or arent they just real friends?dave still hasnt bothered giving me his new number .. i mean why must he care, after all i guess im not worthy enough of being given a new number  C i guess shes too busy getting better and being with real people, ppl who really matter, i dont matter.  Spoke to sal yesterday, her mums back,i hope aunty calls.   Some where along the line ive become this "thing" that craves for a little recognition an acknlowdgement,from people i know, to tell me that i am being thought of and i'm not forgotten . Alas, its just doesnt work that way i guess. No one really cares, not unless you are real. Am i real?
