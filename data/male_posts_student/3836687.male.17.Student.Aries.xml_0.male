The train was delayed, it was ususally on time. It was raining, it was autumn and autumnal with it. The rain was dense, not  forceful, dense, the light was brown with the trees, the wind agitating them, they twitched. Now that the train was running late The ticks,of the station clock were louder, there were no tocks, the people were quieter, close to the platform edge, looking along the line, desperate to be the first to see it. The first to pick up their bag, their suitcase, put out their cigarette, to prompt the same from the others.   The train wasn’t for him, he didn’t need to go anywhere. he needn’t step forward, needn’t cross the dangerously yellow line. Anyway he wasn’t the kind of man who suffered anxiety. The automated woman on the loudspeaker dolefully told the platform that the train would arrive in three minutes, that she was terribly sorry for any inconvenience that she had caused. Of course she was.  But when it did trundle in, warming the air with all its thick rumble, when he recognised her standing behind the door, when the door was slid out of her way, when she held her hat onto her head in the wind, struggling to get her suitcase out, caught on something, all that he had tried to conjure softened a little, butter left out of the fridge. She smiled grimly at him, they wouldn’t need to change this scene, they wouldn’t need to make it more dramatic, more cinematic more... more.   “Hello, Jack” “Hello Elisabeth” and the smiles, still grim grew and relaxed, this was important, and real. He was neccesary, and he still tried to be brave. He gave her his cigarette, she smiled him her gratit ude, she meant it. “How’s things?” he spluttered a half coughed snigger, the question was not one that needed answering.   There was no car, he had walked. He took her suitcase, it was a little way back, they both enjoyed the rain, it was exciting. They spoke, about other people, gossip really, it was not the time for talk of themselves. They wondered together about houses they passed about curtains closed and curtains open, about the pristeen and the derelict. This was very easy talk. Her visit, their being together again, for though they were so instantly comfortable again, though they so easily slipped back into old routines, they had not seen one another  for a time now, no, of course there were real reasons for all this, best not talked about yet though, they both knew.  The bush alongside the path had been neglected, the water hanging under all the leaves was bothered coldly off onto their clothes. He fumbled for the keys, found them and opened the door. He turned the light on, set her suitcase down. took of his hat, and coat, stood, he watched her, take of hers, his arm out to take it from her, she was really very thin, beautifully but sadly so.
