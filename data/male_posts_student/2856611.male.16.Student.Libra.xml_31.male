Things have been awsome, Nick comes back Monday night which was cool so then on Tuesday morning im online and he comes online and tells me of this girl he met called Jen, and then he came over mine and we made toasties and talked about Kenya and then Xav came over, then we went to town where I bought a new CD player that has this really cool attachment thats a tape with a wire that plugs into your CD played and you can play CD's in cassette cars. I also bought John Frusciante's album - Shadows Collide With People which is absoloutly awsome, I love it and I got some comics too. Then we went back to Xavs for a little while and listened to Nicks new Chili's albums and then Xav went for an interview so me and Nick went back to his where his mum gave us a roast dinner and lemon and lime jelly. Then we realised that we were meant to be back at mine for when Xav turns up. So I run up stairs to get my stuff and my MUM calls, I pick up;  Mum:  Rhys, do you know Xavs here?  Me:  Um... yeah about that, hes staying  Mum:  Oh right, where are you then?  Me:  At Nicks... he's staying too  Mum:  Okay...  Me:  I'll be home soon! So long! Done and done I tell thee so back at mine we ass around, try and play monopoly then blah blah blah. Okay next day me and Nick go to his house then go to Xavs then go see spiderman 2 and then um *thinks* oh then I go to Nicks and sleep over his where I play Holdstock at online Connect 4... he won. Me and nick drew some pictures and then I went home the next morning after our who can Make/Butter/Eat your toast and clean your plate first race. It was a draw.
