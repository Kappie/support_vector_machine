I've been excited about my first mutual fund since I bought one. I read a lot of articles and finance for dummies, did some research and enjoy it!! I can't wait to see my first lump-sum to double its values.  It is 5:57am and I am still awake because I am talking to Edith. She told me that she is a changed person and she will go to Toronto to see me. We will see
