You just don't expect an elderly man like him to be so happy, friendly, and talkative. My original stereotype of the "old man" is a grumpy lump of wrinkles living between shots of Valium. He killed that mold. Mr. Givenneti is the greatest conversationalist I known, and it is a great pleasure to listen to what he says. Mostly all I do is nod, drink root beer, and interject an occasional statement, but that is just fine for me. I'm a listener, not a talker. He talked about many things: using newspaper as insulation, meeting Babe Ruth, listening to the Pope preach in 7 languages, a Pennslyvanian who owned a mine, a friend he knew who threatened to break down the door if he wasn't let in at a hospital in WWII, a man nicknamed Maps who always was with his maps, a guy nicknamed Colonel because he looked like the Colonel, the real colonel walking up and down the ranks talking to random men, old women knitting as they walked their cows home in France and Italy, a friend from the Humane Society who wouldn't give dogs to certain people because they would use the dogs in animal fights, and this is all in one day. Today, my Mom and I did something special and got them some roast beef sandwiches from Arby's. They hadn't had burgers in a long time.   We showed them a project I did for my Debate class that I got a 60/60 on. I was quite proud of my work there. It really came straight from the heart and was a pleasure to write. Mr. G and his friend Cindy were very pleased by it and demanded that I start writing more, and bring some of it in sometime.  Also, on the trip to Arby's, I bought a nonbleeding highlighter for my Bible. Fun stuff. A fulfilling day.
