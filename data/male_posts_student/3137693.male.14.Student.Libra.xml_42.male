So, of course kids now wear them. I want to buy them, too, just (and only) so I can piss off Biddy Nation. The rebellion through Jelly Bracelets has begun!  P.S. Im starting the "line of the day", personally thought up by myself.  Line Of The Day:  I hope in the future Americans are thought of as vicious, warlike people. That way, high schools could use ‘The American’ as their mascot
