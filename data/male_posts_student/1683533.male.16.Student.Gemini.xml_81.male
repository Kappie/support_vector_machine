And got a shiiiiiiiiiiitload done.  Then on saturday, I went to Great Lakes Crossing with Mike, and we met his ex-girlfriend (Aly) and her friend (Kristen) there to see a movie.  But it took forever to find them LOL....while we was waitin I bought a gnarly pair of slip-on Vans. >_ _  sorry...i have been doing no rants...I have been blogging less and less...i dunno...i will try to post more often...but yea...i'm doing pretty good...HALF DAYS ARE COMING UP...I can't wait...I love having less of school...but then again..who doesn't?
