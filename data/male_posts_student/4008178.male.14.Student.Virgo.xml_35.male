The high class would be the only ones getting any services, therefore they would be the only ones aware of what is going on in the country.  what for? so that the gap between rich and poor can widen? so that the people with money can puppeteer what goes on inside the country?  did you know that after the treaty is signed, any copyrights made in the country will belong to the united states' government after ten years? what does this mean? that if i write something, the author will be the united states. that the united states can change whatever they want to change, whenever they want to.  did you know what happened to mexico after the agreement was signed? they had an economical deficit. sure, the u.s. says "oh mexico's economy rose like hell after the treaty was signed" bullshit. we all know what really happened to mexico. after walmart came into mexico to exploit the comercial areas in the country, the country lost mos of its money, and then the economy "rose" when they had to sell the national bank... to the U.S.  for what do we need any american countries? doesd america really need to steal more money out of poor people? do they need to come in here to destroy the country? why do i have to say yes to anything that a pissy gringo tells me to do? since when do i follow orders from someone who enjoys killing people? if theres someone who needs the be the US's yes-man, let him be, but im gonna stand against him with everything ive got. so that the americans can laugh at me and spit on my soil? no thank you.
