The stress,pressures and factors that are applied on an individual that inhibit the amount of success/failure that he can acheive. Some call it chance, others opportunities and some others fate.No matter how hard an individual tries he never acheived the results that he sets out to acheive. nothing ever dne goes right he first time , on successive reattemts lead to further rejections. How many rejections can an individual take? Even simple tasks have to be redone atleast twice to make them work right.    Nothing i have ever done has worked right the 1st time. none of the tasks undertaken have gone smoothly. I have aways thought that thats the way life is , more fun when things dont go right. I guess im gettng to the end my patience tolerence factor. whos the blame God or me ?
