Anyway, her theory went like this: She was attracted to both guys and girls, and I was the best of both worlds. I liked to work out, and I could take charge -- yet I was also a choir boy with a love of fine music and nature, and in touch with my feminine side.  This was exemplified tonight when, even after predicting *exactly* what would happen, I still teared up when Rachel left Ross at the airport, and then the tears started  streaming  when she walked into Ross's apartment as he was listening to her answering machine message.  I chalk this up to three things: 1) I started watching the show when it came out hace 10 anos. Though I haven't watched it regularly in years, I did watch it all the time in high school... So it kind of reminds me of my childhood. 2) I am tired and stressed out with finals and school, so I am in a weakened emotional state. 3) Rachel and Monica never actually mud-wrestled together. I was waiting for that for the past DECADE, and I heard a rumor it was going to happen this year, and it DIDN'T happen, and now it will  never  happen.  So I cry. I am not ashamed at my inner woman. Indeed, I think she should help me out more often. Maybe then my house would be clean, and I'd actually have some homecooked meals to dine upon.
