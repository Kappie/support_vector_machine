We had a different block schedule. instead of having Science on one day and Social Studies on the next, we had Science in one Semester and Social Studies on the next. The first semester i had Social Studies and in 7th grade we learned about Geogrophy from Dr. Coburn. Then, in the second semester I learned Science from Mrs. Bozeman. But way ane still had electives on A dd B day. only we had two electives per semester instead of four every nine weeks. the first semester I had Art and PE, the second semester I had Technology (I'll get into that later) and Drama (talk about it later).     Okay...now that you know my schedule...here is....7th Grade...    Well during 6th and 5th grade I got picked on alot by the kids because of my weight and weirdness. but torwards the begining of 7th grade, I struck back with an iron fist!   That year...I actually got a social life...scary aint it?                            TABLE 13/15   Well it started out as all things do....in the lunch room.  In the beggining of 7th grade we had assigned seating during lunch. Which meant we had to sit with our AA classes instead of wherever we wanted too. SO! My lovely AA table never accepted me so I lied and told the Cafeteria announcer (Dean Greenaway or Mr.s Utly) that my AA table was too crowded to let me sit with them, so she let me sit at a single table with the number 13 dangling above it. I sat there, alone and bored, eating my lunch...feeling exciled from the rest of eighth grade. I was extremely depressed. Until Ryan Hewitt (who has recently appologized for running out on me, but he still denies my version of the story) Sat by me. For weeks it was just me and Ryan, sitting there, talking. Then, somewhere around Christmas. A certain someone showed up. Someone who would forever change that school, and that lunch room...A Mr. Paul Lefluer moved from Jupiter to our little lovely city. And he, being the genius he was, had no clue where his AA table was...so he, being the genius he was, decided to sit at the "EXCILES: TABLE 13" table. Which then became the "EXCILES AND CLUELESS NEW KID: TABLE 13"   Well after Paul showed up, another new student appeared...Ryan Weiss, a skater punk kid. So then the table was dubbed "exciles...AND CLUELESS NEW STUDENTS: TABLE 13" Paul and Ryan Weiss were best freinds. After that, another kid joined the growing table. Nels. Then Dong Dong Ho (real name, we call him David)Then Matt Baker. From then on...all political hell broke loose. If you put 5 democrats with one republican...World WarIII is unleashed. So then, our table was dubbed: "THE POLITICAL DEBATING EXCILES AND CLUELESS NEW STUDENTS: TABLE 13". Which made us a little happier. And then there was the pointless conversations. Once, during an entire lunch period, we had a conversation on donuts. Thats all we talked about all through the entire lunch.     And Paul always was yelling about something everyday, and always smart talking the Dean. So he was an unfavorite among the Cafeteria Announcers. One time I made Matt Baker laugh so hard that he had milk come out of his nose plus spill his milk all over the table!   Paul was just sitting down on the other side of the table when it happened so of course he got blamed for it! He was so pissed off. It was so funny. Another time, Dean Greenaway was announcing lunch. Me, Paul, Nels and Ryan sang the song Stacies Mom. Then, out of no where, the table next to us started singing it, then the next table, suddenly about 6 tables were singing that stupid annoying song and we felt so proud. Dean Greenaway, of course, classified it as a distraction to people eating (WTF?!?!?) and yelled at us all. We felt shattered.    7th Grade was the year the JP incident happened. JP Latour, thinks he's the coolest kid in the world just because he did a magic act in the sixth grade talent show. He thinks he is so cool! He drives us all crazy! He thinks he's the most popular guy in school just because he knows a few hot girls. He laughs at his own jokes, to make that worse...he steals peoples jokes, and then laughs at them as if they were his own. And then he whines all the time. He threatenend to sue people all the time. He lied. He said his uncle worked at the Playstaion company and he got a free PS3! WOW! And then he said that he was the richest guy in school. You'll never geuss where he chose to sit during lunch. That month was absolute insanity. He was absolutely the most annoying, irritating, bragging, selfish, arogant person on earth and HE CHOSE TO SIT WITH US!!!!! WTF WAS HIS PROBLEM?!?!? Well, I was absent one day, and then, when I returned the next day. Ryan and Nels were in detention and had to clean the lunch room for 4 weeks. It turns out that JP really really pissed off Ryan and Nells and they kicked the hell out his backpack. He whined to the dean and they had to serve detention and clean the lunch every thursday for 4 weeks...plus! They had to also write an appology letter to the little twerp. From then on, JP has not been on our freindly list and he better pray that he doesn't meet Ryan in a dark alley. Ryan wrote a little song about Jp...     "ohhh...you can tell JP by his gut! You can tell JP by his gut! It's 30 inches round,three feet off the ground! You can tell JP by his GUT!!"      By the way...Me, Paul, Ryan, Nels and JP are all fat! So the Table was now being called by the preppy kids: "THE FATASS POLITICAL DEBATING KIDS AND A COUPLE OF SKINNY NEW CLUELESS STUDENTS: TABLE 13"  We felt sad after that.    I met someone very special in my heart that year...someone who could love me like a man....I met Micheal Fl...uh...nevermind...sorry...                             DARRIN BRACEWELL                             THE WORST THING ON EARTH                That year, during the middle of the 1st semester. Darrin Bracewell entered that school and plagued my life for eternity. When I die, my soul will never be at peace, because Darrin Bracewell will always haunt my memories. DARRIN FRIGGIN BRACEWELL CAN EAT FUDGE AND DIE! He had down syndrome...he was more advanced and intelligent than most kids with DS but he still had that irritating voice. HE WAS STILL STUPID!!! He would always annoy me and my freind Eric Skinner in class. He would talk and talk and talk. Finaly, it went from just talking, to friggin following me and harrassing me about my weight when he weighed like 90 fudging pounds and was like a freaking stick. He followed and followed and harrassed and harrassed. I didn't want to be mean because he was kinda mental but finaly, one day i snapped. " LEAVE ME ALONE YOU LOSER!!!!" At first I regreted what I said because I thought he was gonna cry. and then, he did the unthinkable! He grabbed my lunch box, poured all the food unto the ground and put the lunchbox on his head and ran around in circles. I thought he lost his mind. Then he threw the lunchbox at me and made his annoying laugh (a very high pitched " HEHHHH HEHHH HEHHH" mentally unfit type of laugh.) and rann off down the hallway, laughing and dancing. I stared at the empty hall for five minutes...so confused...then I actually blinked and I said "What...just...happened?"   Then I picked up my food and walked to class...I was late and got an After School Detention. Darrin was not on my freindly list.  the day after that...it was worse...He went to the place that me and the guys hang out in the morning and waited for me to show up. then he laughed his annoyingstupid laughed and said "Vwell, it theems, the big boy hasth returned from his mommysth car."   " What...THE..HELL...ARE...YOU...TALKING...ABOUT?"   " OH, I think you knowsth, you knowths very wellsth."   "GO AWAY!!"  " I think I'll thstay here"  " Boy! If you don't back yo slow booty out of here I'm gonna knock yo brain right!"   My freind Labrentae said as he stared at Darrin.  " Get of awayth from me, black boy!"   " HELL NO! OH NO YOU DIDN"T!!! YOU LITTLE WHITE SLOW, RETARDED PEICE OF TRASH!!  " Labrentae, It's okay, let me handle him."   I walked up and faced Darrin face to face. We were so close I could feel his smelly nasty breath. " Get away from me..."   "Fine, I'll leaf you alone..."  Then he once again grabbed my lunch box and did his little dance.  After retreiving my lunch and calming the steaming Labrentae down. I finaly sighed a huge sigh of releif. For that minute...everything was peacefull. Then Paul walked up and asked me, " Did that kid just put your lunchbox on his head and dance around in circles?"   "...thank you for noticing Paul"  "oh...anytime"    The next day:  Well the next day everything started out fine. No Darrin, no problems. Then during Lunch I had a surprise visit to our table from my best female freind at the time: Hannah Nute. "Hey Hannah! Whaddaya need?" I said cheerfully.   "Hannah squeezed into the table of teenage boys. " I nee-WATCH IT BUDDY!! KEEP YOU HANDS IN YOUR POCKET!"   " David! No touchy on the butty!" I yelled to David  " Oh, sorry ma'am"  " Whatever. Karl, I need you to tell Darrin to leave me alone."  "Is he messing with you?"   " He won't stop! He follows me and he won't shut up!"  "Okay. You leave it to me."    The Hallway, the next day:   I walked up behind Darrin and grabbed the handle to his backpack and slammed his back against the wall. He laughed his annoying laugh and went " Wattsth wrong Karl? You'th got a problem?"  " when I say don't mess with me...that means don't mess with my life. When you mess with my freinds, you mess with me. Do you understand?"  He giggled and went "Yesth sthir"  "Good, now I hate being mean like this Darrin but your driving me crazy here."  " Your stho fat and ugly! I'm sthorry, it'sth hard for me"   His lisp was driving me insane. I shook my head and walked away. Then I realized my lunchbag was missing. I turned around just to see Darrin running off laughing. Well, even though i was fat, I ran and ran and ran untill I cornered him in the bathroom. He had one arm extendted over a used urinal, his hand had the lunchbag clenched tightly. " Darrin, give...me...the lunch...bag...now."   His hand opened and the lunch bag fell and his other hand pulled the lever and my lunch was now heavily stained in urine. I had no food and Ryan wuldn't share his pizza. It was officially war...  One day I was late when darrin was waiting for me in the morning. By the time I got there I saw Ryan pulling Darrins backpacks sleeves off. And then dumping all of Darrins stuff all over the ground. I shook my head and walked up towards the ugly scene. " Ryan, give him a break." I said as I kicked the ruined backpack and folders towards Darrin. "Get out of here" I said. "What if I thdont want too?" " Ryan?"  "Ya?" " do you enjoy ripping Darrins backpack to bits?"  "Very much...why?"  "Because if Darrin doesn't leave in 10 seconds, I'm going to let you do it more."  Darrin gathered all his stuff and shot off. The next day darrin came to school with a big orange plastic crayon box with the word CRAYOLA engraved on the side. " Oh my god Paul...does he have a Crayon box as a backback?"   "Ya...but wait...if it's a crayon box.....uh...it's not a backpack..."  " Very good Paul."  "Thank you"  "anytime"  "okay"  "ya"  "How are you?"  "I'm good, how you doin?"  " can't complain..."  "thats good"  "ya"    That day I decided to go to the guidance counselor about Darrin. I told her about how he was harrassing me and Hannah. She solved the entire problem and he stopped bugging me for a while.   Well besides the whole Darrin situations, 7th grade was an extremely exciting year, I made many new friends and I explored the horizons…ok. It was very interesting! I kind of made my peace with Mr. Gardiner that year. It still wasn’t a perfect relationship but he calmed down on the ASDs. I got put back into his class in the second semester. And I was very aggravated about it when I got the notice. He was so unfair and he was such a jerk in sixth grade that I was about to march right up to one of the administrator’s offices and ask to be put into another class. Well, the only reason I really ever hated the guy was because I thought he hated me. He barely ever said “good morning” back to me in the \hallways whenever I saw him. And the day I told him about me getting put into his class, he told me he was going to recommend me to be removed from it. Stating that I was too immature to be placed into his class. Well I was an extremely immature student, the worst! But everybody deserves a chance. And I got it. In Sixth Grade Technology we just did one project and three homework assignments. The big project was building a bridge out of wooden sticks…Very thin, wooden sticks. It was much, much harder than it sounded. We had to sketch our bridge design on graph paper, read a huge book on engineering. And then very carefully build the bridge slowly out of the sticks using precise measurements and equations. We were only eleven-year-old sixth graders…Do I need to say what my grade in the class was? I already told you didn’t I? Well, must I say what my grade on that project was? Figure it out…   Luckily, in seventh grade, we got to choose through a number of different technological modules to work in. We got one partner to work with for an entire semester. I was lucky to pick Tyler Maddox…I can’t say that Tyler was lucky though. Tyler and me became best friends in that class. The first module him and me chose was Pneumatics. Man, I was good at pneumatics! I was an expert at plugging those tubes in and turning the pump on. That module had some complicating assignments and experiments. We had to read five pages on a pneumatic device of some kind, and then at the end of the article it gave us an assignment or experiment with the pneumatic equipment.   We had to work at pneumatics for a long time. When we were done with pneumatics we still clung to the subject but chose a different module…The Pneumatic Robot! It was an electric arm powered by…guess…and we were able to pick up blocks and swing them from one location to another. It was really cool. And the best part was, we controlled it using a computer. It was still complicated though; we had to control the speed of the arm by adjusting the air pressure. And that was so confusing. And then, you had to operate the arm using Binary code. So in order to move the arm to the left you had to type in 0110 and press enter. In order to close the clamp and grab onto to something you pressed 1001 and pressed enter. Okay, anyways, one time Jonathan Senterfitt and me came up with the crazy idea to check out how strong the clamp and swinging power of the arm was. So…I gently placed my nose in between the clamp and Tyler typed in the command to close it. It hurt…then, without any warning, Tyler attempted to command the arm to swing to the left, towards him and Jonathan. Well, Tyler...ooh…Tyler “accidentally” typed in the wrong code and the arm swung to the right, um…I didn’t know it but Jonathan put the pressure on maximum so it swung to the right very hard and very fast. ALSO! There was a wall was to the right of the arm. So… I went unconscious for a couple of seconds, and my nose nearly broke, and Tyler and I almost got expelled from school…besides that…IT WAS SO AWESOME!!!!     Another incident with the robot was an actual accident. None of the outcome was intentional.  Tyler was picking up some blocks with the arm and swinging them to the other side of the platform and dropping them. I was watching the arm from a distance and making sure there were no tubes that were loose or anything. Anyway, the assignment was to put the PSI pressure on like 80 or something really high (I forget all about PSI and stuff…it WAS three years ago.), pick up a block, swing it and release it on the other side of the platform perfectly with out any problems. The point was to show us how difficult it was to maneuver something when the air pressure is really high. Well we screwed up like fifty times, Tyler kept releasing too late and the block kept falling off the platform. So, he tried to release a little earlier. The stupid boy released the block when the arm was in mid-swing. I was standing on the other side of the module and guess who the block hits square in the forehead….ME. With all the different kids in the room. The block flies at me at like 15 miles per hour. Man…Tyler really hated me…  Another time, we were at the Pneumatic module and the PSI was on really high on one of the instruments. Me, being the smart person I am, decided to see what it was like if I pulled one of the tubes out from the device. I was holding one end of the tube, the other end was connected to the air pump thing. It was a very thin tube, but it was very strong and very powerful. That tube was flying around like a snake on Anti-Depressants. The air from the tube was blowing all over the place. It slapped me in the face like 20 times and it, you know, it hurt. I was flailing my arms around trying to keep control of the thing but there was a lot of air pressure in that machine. I couldn’t keep it still for more than a second. Even when I got one half of the tube still, the loose end would snap back and forth violently and slap me in the face real hard. My hands and fingers were getting the worst beating. I was lucky that Tyler was there because he turned the demon machine off and the tube just flopped down, like a string. I stood there, my hair all wild and fluffed up…long, thin, red marks all over my face, my fingers all bruised and sore...AND HE LAUGHED!!!   The evil little twerp. Mr. gardiner walked by our module and stared at me, shook his head and walked away.  Tyler Maddox was really cool though. He dressed like a rich prep, but he NEVER acted like one. He had a funny personality, yet he always kept school on the mind. He was a good friend to have. And he was smart...                                The Stunts  Well...in 7th grade...I did some pretty crazy stunts...
