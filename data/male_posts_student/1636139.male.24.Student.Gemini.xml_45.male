Then today I went to a pumpkin patch for the 1st time ever. On a different note, I figured out how to work around the problem with the latch on my powerbook, thanks to a tip from my brother. And, after finishing  The Prisoner of Azkaban , I now understand why everybody simply  had  to start reading the next book.
