I fell asleep while I was doing Economics and I had a dream I was stabbed to death while I was sleeping.  What a comfort...Well now I am really tired and I can't go to sleep because I am here by myself and I just predicted own death.  Abraham Lincoln had a dream about dying and look what happened to him.  Also being stabbed to death is in my opinion one of the worst ways to die.  I would much rather have the blood sucked out of my neck(Hi Hannah).  Apparently "some people" find vampirism abnormal but  "unnamed others" find it wicked hott but now is not the time or place to discuss such things.  I need a rotweiler or a gun or both.  I need a big  guard with "MOM" tatooed on his shoulder.  HYMNS!!!  That will help my nerves!!!  HYMNS GRAPEJUICE AND A GOOD BOOK!!!  unfortunately  i am too afraid of the man in the hooded robe who stabs me repeatedly in the back of the head to actually go get my book or juice so I will just sing "Come Thou Fount".  my house is way too dark and creepy...I wish Jesus would bodily come forth or an angel...pretty much anybody.  You know what would be nice... if Mr.President were to knock on my door and offer Secret Service protection(from myself).  Actually if someone were to knock on that door I would have a heart attack and die and save my murderer the trouble...What a coward...i can wait till i am old enough to own a gun cuz in moments like this i need it.  i think getting married will help because then i will have another human to talk to and also the protection instinct will kick in...sorta like when a mom lifts a car off her kid.  how does the kid get under a parked car anyways?  where is the driver to this vehicle?  something to think about...
