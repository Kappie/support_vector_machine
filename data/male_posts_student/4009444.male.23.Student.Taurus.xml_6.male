The bouncers were yelling at these Mexicans when we were on the way in, saying "I don't need to see your ID, I need to see a green card!"  Horrible, yet funny.  Love: Fake fights Games involving bean bags Eric yakking Calling people on other peoples phones and leaving wretched voicemails  Hate: Losing contacts Forgetting to get your credit card back from your bartab Having to return to the bar the next day with a large tip added to your tab
