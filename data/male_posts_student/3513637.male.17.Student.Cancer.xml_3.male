This will come in separate parts, and this first part will be an introduction to the formula that the value theorem will be based around. (note: this formula is not proven, it is merely an observational release).   Introduction:  How many times have you come across a situation where you have been newly introduced (or re-introduced as the situation may be) to something and then you begin to notice this everywhere, but before this instant you never noticed? As an observer this "thing..." i would relate to my theorem of value.  Basics: The basic idea of the value theorem is that the value of something varies directly to amount noticed. In other words, the value placed on something will increase as the amount of notice of that item increases. For example if you suddenly begin to notice something more often than usual then it is implied that the value of that item has increased by a certain amount.     I shall finish this later  Notice:  Now the part of this theorem that is errr harder to agree with... is notice. Now the idea of notice isn't a unit of measurement like CM or M, most obviously, but our "notice" is just what it sounds a measure of notice. The amount u notice something will be measured in times. Notice is a discrete number and should be dealt with accordingly as a discrete variable.
