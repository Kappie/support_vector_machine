I got my one dollar bills together (nearly 100) and than begged parents some who for the exchange of B-day gifts pitched in 250 than I took your great donations that you readers graciously gave me and added it (now I have about 275 for those of you who are math challenged.) finally I got out some of my twentys and made the rest up. this is a great day. For those of you who donated thank you. I might let them touch it. :-P
