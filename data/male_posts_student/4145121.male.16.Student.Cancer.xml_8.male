It ain't my National Day anyway, so I'll make do with the long holiday and the great TV programmes, hopefully. Anyway, me and my study buddy sorta set a personal record today. Ya huh, you guessed it, she's D. U can think of D as devil if you'd like and my other friend A as angel...yepp. So me and her were chatting merrily till...3am. And did I mention A was supposed to turn up? Oh yea. She totally stood us up. Heh. Woohoo. That IS hardcore I tell you. We were talkin about things like having siblings. Yes, she has a point, that being the only child has its good points. But rawr. I SO wanna have a sibling. I gotta thank her for her offer to gimme her sister...but sorry that I havta reject :p Oh yes, and she was hurling insults at me. And lucky her, because it's her National Day, I decided to let her off. She called me FAT. ME?! FAT?! She is so dead. And she so insulted my house and afterwards me. Rawr. Oh well, and she's grounded. So I still can't think of how to pass her her ND present. I'm not gonna mention it here...it's a surprise. Heh. Oh well...I think I'll mug a bit and catch the teens award at noon. Oh yea...3am is a record.
