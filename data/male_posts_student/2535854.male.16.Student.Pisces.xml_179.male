Damn I just heard some car fishing slam on the brakes..must be a drunk driver..  Well dont think im going to Najat`s party..wouldnt mind going buts its more evenin oriented and on that particular day,a free evening to go out and have fun is not exactly and option and stuff..relatives coming over la...and grandma`s comming to stay so I don`t think I could get out anyway...May be going to grab a Paella with Cheryl but I dunno..  Okay from im hearing it sounds like that illegal racing stuff in Bangsar..dont know much about it..saw some article headline but didn`t bother to read it.Why should I?It aint concern me!  And Sarah is bugging me to get her,her coffee and a coffee maker.She yells it at and whacks me and then starts smiling sweetly and talks like and angel and what not.How cute ;).  Also a big congrats to Raimie who broke up with girl a few weeks ago!haha I forgot to write about it..that idiot..Fishing playa!  well making another post...later
