The parents took the babies to the car wash, and LEFT the babies in the CAR with the windows OPEN while the car was in the wash! They almost freakin drowned! And that little spoiled bitch Angelica only made it worse, by opening the sunroof so the babies are showered in shampoo that could seriously do damage if they swallowed it.  Next one, the grandpa takes the babies to a park while it's like 105 degrees outside, and LEAVES them there. That's right, he goes to the other side of the park to talk to some people. he even wrecks the water supply by breaking a pipe, so the water fountain the babies were using gets cut off. Tommy almost dies of fucking sunburn. If it wasn't for that arabian baby who's parents seem to be also non-existant, they probably would have died.  Is  The Rugrats  a "don't let this happen to your children" video? Seriously, if my parents were that fucking stupid, I'd eat them. Or send them to a big factory where stoopid people are eaten. But they're not, so they're lucky.
