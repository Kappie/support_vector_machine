Surprisingly i did get a hundred, we were supposed to integrate sentence structure thingies into it, but i wasn't planning on doing it. But now that i got it back it seems i have alot of the structure thingies in it. I had to write on a song, mainly a song that spoke to me...here are the lyrics to this song i choose, which was graduation by vitamin c.    Vitamin C  Graduation     And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives Where we're gonna be when we turn 25 I keep thinking times will never change Keep on thinking things will always be the same But when we leave this year we won't be coming back No more hanging out cause we're on a different track And if you got something that you need to say You better say it right now cause you don't have another day Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down These memories are playing like a film without sound And I keep thinking of that night in June  I didn't know much of love But it came too soon And there was me and you And then we got real cool Stay at home talking on the telephone with me We'd get so excited, we'd get so scared Laughing at our selves thinking life's not fair And this is how it feels  As we go on We remember All the times we Had together And as our lives change Come whatever We will still be Friends forever  So if we get the big jobs And we make the big money When we look back now Will our jokes still be funny? Will we still remember everything we learned in school? Still be trying to break every single rule Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man? Can Heather find a job that won't interfere with her tan? I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye Keep on thinking it's a time to fly And this is how it feels  As we go on We remember All the times we Had together And as our lives change Come whatever We will still be Friends forever  La, la, la, la Yeah, yeah, yeah La, la, la, la We will still be friends forever  Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now? Can we survive it out there? Can we make it somehow? I guess I thought that this would never end And suddenly it's like we're women and men Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round? Will these memories fade when I leave this town I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye Keep on thinking it's a time to fly  As we go on We remember All the times we Had together And as our lives change Come whatever We will still be Friends forever  As we go on We remember All the times we Had together And as our lives change Come whatever We will still be Friends forever  As we go on We remember All the times we Had together And as our lives change Come whatever We will still be Friends forever   Yah the song isn’t what most listen to. But there is meaning to why i choose the song. Here is my OP paper...  This song, Graduation, was playing while I was driving off from my home, Edmonton. Looking back and seeing my friends and life behind me in the fierce dust cloud the tires spun up. This song has come up many times before I left Edmonton, it played at my graduation, at my party and while I was driven off.  	Everything I had was left behind. The only things of value that I carried with me were my Play station 2, my alarm clock, and my camera. My life was left behind and everything about me was left behind. You can say that this here is a shell of my former self. My graduation is about when everything collided. But this song seems to remind me of everything, whenever I hear it. It makes me remember my old girl friend, Meghen, and all the good times and the bad that we had. People seem to come to thought, such as Michelle. She is the classic other half of my example of to have loved and lost. Dating a girl and loving another one at the same time isn’t a good thing, I can safely say that from experience. And then another friend that I had to leave was my best friend Tommy. I’ve known him for 14 years up to this day. If there is anyone I regret leaving the most it’s him. Just picking up and leaving like that never seemed fair to me. I had so much in Edmonton, I thought I had it all worked out and everything perfect… that is until graduation when my dad said we’re moving to Texas. It was the worst news I had ever heard. I though everything was good up until that dark moment. All I could do was try to have fun while it lasted. But I couldn’t even do that. Just the fact of knowing that will be your last party together. I wasn’t the same for the whole night, and I kept hearing this song. This song tells exactly what was going thought my mind at that time. So I had my fun that night, or at least the closest thing to it, and continued on. 	Now I am but a living memory, just waiting to return to my body. Of course, as memories do, I drift along, still remembering on how my life used to be. For that is all I have now; the old memory of what I did have and what I was. This, here in front of you is only a lost piece, a lost piece with a will to get home. Through constant torments and the tests of life I trudge. But will there ever be a way out? I have found some people here that I really would miss, but this time I’m not going to flow with the crowd. This is song is what I don’t want to hear because it reflects my weakness. You can’t judge a book by its cover, just like you can’t judge a book by finding one of its lost pages.  	Graduation was the mark of my worries and pain, that why this song will always carry with me, for it is my memory, sealed in a disk.   that is my blog... sanku
