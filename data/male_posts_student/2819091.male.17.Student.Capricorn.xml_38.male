Gives and takes, That's what it usually makes. If only time went backwards during the time  she  had to depart... If only time forbade us to have part. Then again, we never really knew each other that well, Yet why do I feel that it was her that caused me to have fell? I don't know, Am I in love with her? Do I really love her? Is this just lust or passion? Or is it something else? I don't know... That's time for everyone,  Neither generous nor selfish... Time doesn't take wishes, Time just gives... Then it suddenly takes. How I wish that time never took this from me.
