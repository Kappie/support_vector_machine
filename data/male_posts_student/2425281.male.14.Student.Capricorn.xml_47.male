Andy got gum stuck to his shoe and said "This is not funny" as he tried to remove it by scraping it on the ground.  As you can see nothing much has happened (coz u kno andy counts for nothing) and i'm just doing this because i'm supposed to be finding out about the Greens and i can't be bothered to do so.   Also just to piss off Rajiv who is sitting next to me at the moment: Rajiv is a stupid, good-for-nothing, ugly, layabout who sucks at everything he does. If you have something to add to this or agree with this please post a comment.
