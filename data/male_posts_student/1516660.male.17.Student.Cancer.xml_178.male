The Part 2 must include interviews. I wrote about Takeshi Kanashiro lost a 1-billion-yen in the earthquake. HaHaHa!! Lame KY... Then, Mrs Thong told us lots of stories the students wrote. One particularly funny one is that one student wrote himself as a horse (under the title "disappointment"). He fell in love with a female horse and "can't wait for the mating season!" Then, when the mating season came, he went into the female stable and saw his horsey-friend doing "it" to her! He felt dissappointed that he cna't mate with the female horse. OH MY GOD!! Such a story also can!! No wonder Mrs Thong failed him. Meow meow!!   After English, I had SS and History. Meow meow! I did okay for both papers, totalling a total of 76 points! Me-ow meow! My essay for SS was printed you know!! So proud of myself! Mrs Jaili said I explained and evaluated the factors very well! O.O!! Meow meow!   I didn't study anything you know! I came back today too tired. I did some exercises on excretion, but that's not really studying, because I studied the chapter already. Felt so suilty you know. And tomorrow I am having my final day of relaxation with Ben, XC they all. See la. No studying. Meow!!!  Hmm...I promised you I would continue my yesterday's blog hor? WQ came over to my house today. Took a hell of a time for him to get here. Meow!! We then studied lor. I studied 5 chapters of Physics. Woo-hoo! WQ later told CQ that he thought about food all the time while in my house. He saw that my kitchen was well-stocked with food (instant noodles, ice-cream, snacks). Like we are preparing for some war. No la where got! Parents always buy in bulk one ma. And you don't know the horrible consumption of my family towards instant noodles. We finish them fast. HaHa! And hor, he told me he ate le. Around 4 something, he then come and tell me he wants to eat, because he hasn't eaten anything yet. I don't want to cook for him because it;s too late le. Father's gonna be back soon and later have ot go out to eat dinner. See la. Lie some more. :P Next time ar, don't lie to me about things like that hor. Crazy cat! I think he's just scared of my mother la. Crazy cat!!! Meow meow! He left at 5.30 la.   While eating at 768, I met 510 ex-owners. Lararine and her family. Meow meow!! Long time no see le!   Woah! I tell you ar! I felt so happy when I read 8 Days. Ying TianCheng is gonna die!! YaY!!!!!! He drowned while trying to look at naked women swimming! Retribution! YaY!! Meow meow! So happy man!  I am logging off le. See ya tomorrow! Night blog!
