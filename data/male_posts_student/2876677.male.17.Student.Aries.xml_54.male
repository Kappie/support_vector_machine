It was amazering.  It gave links to both President Bush and Senator Kerry's websites so a voter could be informed by the candidates themselves.  It did not try to drag down either candidate or build either candidate up.  It just emphasized the importance of voting and being politically active.  I was astounded.  Usually every journalist tries to influence his readers nowadays, instead of just presenting the news without his beliefs.  That periodical was  The Collegian  which is put out by BJU.  I was amazed.  Props to BJU for teaching their journalism students to report the issues fair and balanced.  BTW  I am not a journalist and I have an opinion.  Vote for Alan Keyes 2004.  Holla!  *leaves*
