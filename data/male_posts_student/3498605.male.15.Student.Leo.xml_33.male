I just don't want things to get weird, and I know she already has a boyfriend. Meh. Anyways, I probably won't like anyone for the whole summer, but I'm sure when school sets in next year, I'm bound to find someone. Anyways, I have to get back to studying, but first, the Tale of the Antichrist Browser, as promised. So, I was messing around with my browser, trying to set up a proxy server so I could get around the internet blocking thing at school. So, I'm talking to randomperson1 online, and she posted a comment on this blog that I really wanted to see. So, I go to check it out, but noooooo my web browser didn't work. So, I tried to fix at, and nothing worked. Then, my computer screen started randomly flashing. It was almost like my browser was the antichrist and was taunting me saying, "MWAHAAHAHAHAHA, you can't get on the browser to check the comment. Mwehehehehehe, I will eat you soul!" So, I got really pissed, and started hitting my computer. Luckily, all the random hitting of my computer made my internet work! HOORAY! I have defeated the antichrist browser! Anyways, that was the tale of the antichrist browser. Now back to studying, :(.  later, bradleyJ
