We're back from Burton Music Camp. It was pretty cool. I got into AM Band (yes!) and I also got to preform in Full Orchestra (YES!!!). I'm practacing again, this time for my clarinet audition in Youth Symphony. Oh, yeah, back to Burton. A lot of people I knew from school were there, such as:        Fred     Josh     Max     Xavier     Emma     Elana     Jen      Laura            ask Fred about her ;)         Hallie       Cailyn       Ava        and                 Andy.         We had a pretty fun time at camp. Our counselors were cool (note: Xavier, Max, and Andy were in a different cabin than Josh Fred and I, though their counselors were pretty cool, too). One, Keith, had Perfect pitch, was the Choir piano accompanist, and was from Philidelphia (he's going to Temple University). Keith also really liked Douglas Adams's "Hitchhikers Series", so now I'm hooked (I'm 1/4 pf the way through the third installment "Life, The Universe, and Everything". REALLY funny stuff. So were the storires he told us of High School misfortunes. Oh, and Keith walked all around camp with his iPod, which is cool. He also taught us that "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" song. Oh, yeah. Our other counselor, Derek, was on Fred, Josh, and I's side of the cabin. Cool guy. Nice guy. Yeah. Made new friends and camp (Monica). Saw some     interesting       people (2 Goth friends: One's 'name' was Ghost, the other one's was Shade. Turns out Ghost's original name is like Alysia. Who woulda know? During carribean night [Friday] they both had Steel Band workshops so we got to see them preform. After finding out the first one, Ghost's, name after she had done a solo [in minor, oddly enough], we tried to guess what the other's name might be. Darkness? Crow? No. Shade. Huh.). Ran into previous and familiar counselors. All in all, it was a pretty fun week (July 11 - 18). Much better than last year (last year was my 2nd year). I also played in a wind quintet with 8 people ( I was clarinet, Jen and Elana were flute, Max was French Horn, Monica was French Horn, Ava was Oboe, and I can't remember the other 2 poeple. Um... Well, that was camp. Neil came back from Europe and suprised us at the concert. Yeah. Moving on... I've taken a new intrest in C++ again. And Flash is going well. Oh, I had to get a Plantronics around-the-head headset because somehow the left speaker on my really nice Plantronics broke while I was away at camp. Oh well. My ears'll stop screaming at me eventually (not the most comftorable thing invented)   . Well, that's it. See ya.
