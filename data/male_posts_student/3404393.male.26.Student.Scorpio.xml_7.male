It seems to me that if you are looking for a posterchild of the Cronic Blameplacer I can think of no better man. For those of you who saw Bowling for Columbine, I'm sure you know what I mean.  Take for example, a scene near the end, where for some unknown reason Mr. Moore mysteriously connects Charleton Heston to the death of a little girl who was shot, simply because he is was doing a rally for the NRA in the same city shortly after she died.  Is it tragic the girl died? Certainly. Is it Charleton Heston's fault? I can think of nothing farther than the truth, but that is what Michael Moore led the viewers of his film to believe.   How about the time when Mr. Moore dragged a paralyzed teenager to the Kmart corporate headquarters, somehow claiming that because Kmart sold bullets they were somehow responsible for this paralyzed young man. Does that boggle anyone else's mind besides mine? Since when did Kmart, or any other business for that matter, become responsible for the actions of its customer's personal lives?  Better yet, how about the time Mr. Moore walked into a complete stranger's house in Canada simply because the door was unlocked, trying to prove some obscure point. Umm, in America that's called Breaking and Entering and its not only illegal, its a Felony.  I think it is safe to say that these are the same kind of crass, tasteless, twisted and completely unfounded allegations that are present in all Michael Moore's work.  If this is the kind of man that most Americans see as a hero, then this country, as marvelous as it is, is going to the dogs.  Jonathan
