Day 1  Well first off Nick picked me up at around 9:45 and we went to moorpark to pick up mark and sean and to meet up wit dan. It was a long 5 hour drive and at a gas station, which was an hour away from Stockton, dan told us that we had to get ready to play cuz chads mom said that the 1st day of camp was actually today and not tomorrow cuz we thought today we were jus suppose to check in. So when we got there, we jus went to the dorms for a bit then we started playin at the 3rd(last) session of the day. It was coo, only like about 50 players were there total and we basically did a few warm up drills, then passin drills and what not. There was a camp helper there named Al Johnson, we jus call him Al, he was a coo guy from the start, he told me he liked the way i played the game cuz i show a lot of passion when i play...so it was coo. We started scrimmaging the last our of the session, then at 9 it ended...me, mark, nick, sean, and other ppl ended up stayin til 10 cuz we jus hit and stuff...then it was lights out at 11.   Day 2  The 2nd day i woke up and my thighs were a bit sore cuz they have been sore for like a week now. The 1st session started at 8:30 and the plan of today was jus splittin up into different positions...i went wit the outsides cuz thats what i wanted to b, duh. Dan, another dan(hez tall as heck, 6'8)...we told us how to hit cross court and then angle and then blocking from the left side. Then towards the end, dan sent me, mark, and 2 other outsides to play in the upper gym, there r 2 courts in the pac gym and there is one at the top floor but in a different building, and we were put into teams...i did alright passing and what not, my hitting wasn't as good though. Then the session ended at 11:30 and we headed to lunch. At 2:30 we headed back to the gym and started the 2nd session. The guyz from the top gym, including me and mark, had to go play at the gym wit the sports court for the 2nd session. All we did were some wash drills...i got to know some of the players, brett the kick ass setter from cal central, nick this lil dude thats a hot head but can bang, patrick an opposite from diablo valley, hunter a middle from bay to bay, then ppl from chicago...yes i said it...chicago...Well during the wash drills, i did a pretty good job digging balls and hitting aswell. I hit a lot of cut shots, which i like never do, so i was a bit proud. Then our 2nd session ended and headed to dinner. We got back at the gym at 6:30 for our last session of the day...We basically jus got into teams again and jus scrimmaged the whole time...it was fun...on one note, before sessions Al makes us do these crazy drills, like passing the ball to each person wit our legs and doin other stupid stuff, i call them "Al's pointless drills that actually warm me up".   Day 3  Today i woke up sore as all-mighty hell. Sore basically today during the beginning of each session i was jus groachy and jus didnt want to play...but i manage after every session to find the strength and stay for a while to hit. We basically did the same thing what we did yesterday but some drills we did were a bit different. Players that play for Pacific U. help wit the camp and sometimes play wit us and stuff. When we scrimmaged though, the team i was alwayz wit was stacked cuz it consisted of all the best players from the and most of my team was over 6'1, except for lil nick.   Day 4  Well today was the last day of camp, it was sad cuz i'm gonna miss the guyz that i've been playin wit for these 4 dayz. 1st off we went to the weight room for a bit and stuff, then we went back to the gym where john, head coach of Pacific vball, talked about how to get to play here and other colleges, what u needed and what it takes...then at the last session we had to tournament...our team was Russia, cuz all the teams were named after international teams, so our cheer would b "AH MUTHA LAND!!!"...haha, end of the world. During the tourny we did a good job, i actually hit the ball over the block and it would jus b straight down.  Pat did a good job hitting, that fool can freakin bang, then everyone did a good job wit their part...especially brett, that homeboy can set...at the end, my team won the tourney and we got shirts and dan, my coach, told us to do Al's stair thing...cuz each section of seats at the gym were lettered, and we had to spell our name...we basically we had to run up the stairs, touch the letter, then run back, and spell ur name out. So i had to spell out my full name, Charles Randall Keeranan, and it took a hella long time...In the end, Al told me that i was a wonderful player and he wants to c what college i go to in the future, A lot of the players always appreciated me cuz i was such a good player and all that, so it was very nice. On the drive home, we basically listened to Dashboard Confessional, which dan now is in love with...haha, and other ppl...we talked about the history of shoten and about colleges and what not, i told dan that i wouln't mind if i was a recruited walk-on for hawaii and stuff and dan said that alfred is probly gonna convince his coach and stuff and i have a good chance of getting into hawaii, and if i work hard til the fall season, then i would probly b a contender for a scholarship. When we got to ojai, it was jus scary as hell, cuz it was at night and in the freakin wood areas near a haunted school...scary shit...and now im home...   Overall  Well, during this whole trip i had a really really good time. I learned a lot of stuff and i got back to the form that i wanted to b in...i can actually hit over the block and cut the ball and make things happen for my team. The guys at the camp were great and so was the coaching staff...especially Al, that guy is my homey...and it was a very fun trip.   Quotes to remember  "ACTIONS SPEAKS LOUDERS THAN WORDS!"...me copyin dan...haha "Is this switchfoot?" "Seans talkin shit again"...."SEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAANNNNN!!!!" "SHUT YOUR FACE N****! SHUT YOUR FACE!" "This Song is the story of my life" *Dan's facial expressions* ....and others  now back to hard work...late
