Velvet Revolver shows real rock, and  Live  is better than I expected of a, well, live CD. Went to Chinatown today, there was this festival and traffic was a bitch. But the show was pretty cool, with the dancing dragons and some stands selling pirated and fake stuff. Got my computer too. It's a pretty good one from Dell. hehe now i get this one for myself. Whooo. Hope my dad doesnt install a netnanny thingy on it. I dont wanna get caught again... Modded my entire system. Now everything looks like hitman. Hitman windowblinds, hitman clock, hitman logon, hitman bootscreen, hitman screensaver. Super cool. But its all is black. So it hurts to look after a while.  Thats all...
