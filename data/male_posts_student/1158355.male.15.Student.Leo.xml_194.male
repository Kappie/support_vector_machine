So I'm just gonna randomly update this when something exciting happens. Chris is coming over. That's exciting. One more week till mother fucking Easter break so I can get mah Rush in Rio DVD. I always get a little something for Easter. It's funny, because I'm an athiest bastard yet I get a present for Easter. Yea I also realized that there's always high school and college parties in movies, but my life is far from a movie. I'll be lucky to go to 1 party in my entire sex life...which ends after your married. Then your life is boring. Is today National Pecemist Day?
