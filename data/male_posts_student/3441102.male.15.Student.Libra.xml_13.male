So anyway Its some nice shit and theres lyrics and I'm having an almost orgasmic experience jamming this shit out when suddenly the amp goes: krrrrrputputpuzzzzzbrrrrrrrr. Exactly like that. So I'm thinking "Shit is the amp fucked". So plug in my electric guitar and perfecto. So now I'm thinking "Sheet". Unscrew scratchpad and yep one of the wires is fucked and so is one of the pickups. Goddamn son of a bitch I hate that shit. Now I'm begging for this sweet electric blue smooth ass piece of shit maverick from my dad but he probably won't give me the money as it does cost 500 FUCKING quid. Dammit I hate this shit.
