I’m not going to just review new albums/songs either (hell, I’m a poor uni student for fuck’s sake!!), I’m also going to go back and pick some ‘classic’ ones and give you all my two-cents worth.  So in that vein, I give to you, my hapless victims, my first review:  Album: “Load” Artist: Metallica Released: 1996 Genre: Hard Rock Producer/s: Bob ‘pansy pants’ Rock with James Hetfield  Lars Ulrich Tracks: 14 Track Listing: 1.	Ain’t My Bitch 2.	2X4 3.	The House Jack Built 4.	Until It Sleeps 5.	King Nothing 6.	Hero Of The Day 7.	Bleeding Me 8.	Cure 9.	Poor Twisted Me 10.	Wasting My Hate 11.	Mama Said 12.	Thorn Within 13.	Ronnie 14.	The Outlaw Torn   Almost this entire album was a departure of everything everyone assumed Metallica was about. To start with, they changed the style of the way ‘Metallica’ had always been written with the distinctive knife-like points. It was like, from the outset, this album (and the follow-up, ‘ReLoad’) would be their “mid-life crisis” album. They’d released the phenomenally selling ‘Black’ album so where to from there? Release a ‘Black’ clone? Try not to live up to the massive expectations? Or try something new? I think it was mainly a combination of the second and third responses…  The artwork, by Andres Serrano (he of ‘Piss Christ’ fame several years ago), is both a pun on the title but also a piece of art that Kirk Hammett loved and talked the rest of the guys into using (they didn’t all agree on Kirk’s taste). Personally, I like it. Yes, it’s blood and semen squeezed between two sheets of glass. Maybe it’s the art student coming out in me (no pun intended) but I think it’s an awesome change of style for a ‘tallica album cover. All the rest had made not-at-all subtle statements from “Kill ‘em All”’s blood covered hammer through to The Lady Justice on “…And Justice for All”. The “Black” album was a touch more subtle but still rather literal with the ‘Don’t Tread On Me’ snake in the bottom corner. The cover art for “Load” had no direct message, and a hell of a lot of people didn’t even realise what the art was made from until they did some research. Some people hated it, others thought it was all right, and others loved it. The reaction to the artwork itself summed up the reaction to the actual music contained inside…  Anyone who was expecting a carbon copy of the “Black” album was going to be disappointed. Anyone who was expecting ‘tallica to go back to their “true” metal ways were going to be very sorely disappointed. This DID take a lot from the “Black” album (song structure, sound, etc etc etc…) but the rest of it was something a little darker but also a little more… grungy? Alternative? Experimental? Deep? Not as heavy? More mature? Maybe all of those and maybe none. Here was Metallica delving into something other than straight out, ‘in your face’, lyrics and music. They experimented with different tones, layering, vocals, and other bits and pieces to see what they could come up with. And they came up with a lot.  The lyrics took on a more personal twist as Hetfield, rather than just singing about physical and literal subject matter, delved into the psyche more. ‘The House Jack Built’, ‘Until it Sleeps’, ‘Thorn Within’ all deal with a psychological issue of some description.   ‘THJB’ is a look into the collapsing world within (perhaps a pre-marker to Hetfield’s stint in rehab in ‘02/’03?) and is asking us to “step inside”, have a look around and see the corruption that resides. ‘UIS’ is about loss and the aggression and angst that accompany this sense of loss (particularly after a loved one walks away). “So tear me open, but beware, there’s things inside without a care…” is a line I think everyone has wanted to say to a dodgy ‘other half’ who’s just fucked them over. And ‘TW’ is about the guilt and how, no matter how much people look at you with disdain, it will always be the shame the individual feels inside themselves that will be the worst part of it all. People can scorn all they like but it’s what the person feels inside that feels the worst. The conscience is a hard master.  The slower songs also took on a deeper meaning as well. These were an extension, I feel, from ‘Nothing Else Matters’ on the “Black” album. It was their first “real” ballad song and they took what they learnt in that experience and extended it into this album. ‘Hero of the Day’ and ‘Mama Said’ said a lot about the band in the sense that they didn’t HAVE to be a heavy unit all the time. They could take a softer approach and get across a different set of meanings. They didn’t have to be in your face all the time and they learnt more about the idea of building the song to a powerful conclusion. ‘HOTD’ starts out almost country like with its twanging, almost clean, tone, Hetfield’s ungrowled vocals, and then builds to a powerful finish.  Then you have the songs like ‘Bleeding Me’, ‘Cure’, ‘Poor Twisted Me’, and the slightly absurd sounding ‘Ronnie’. These are the “unsung” goodies of the album. ‘BM’ has layers of sound that takes you deeper and deeper as you listen. Layer upon layers: simple guitar riffs, bass, drums, synthesiser, vocals - then the chorus kicks in and kicks you in the guts. It takes you from one extreme to the other and drags you along on its merry little ride. ‘Cure’ has a simple rock beat but don’t mistake this for a simple song. Have a listen and see what I mean. Structure-wise this would be one of the more simple songs on the album but that doesn’t stop it from being a fairly good song.  ‘Wasting My Hate’ was the song that was probably the closest to “old-school” Metallica. Fast, aggressive, take-no-shit attitude. But even this was tempered with the new mentality that had infused the entire album. Different tones, sounds, structures, vocals – it all made it sound old yet decidedly new and it was this “newness” that people didn’t, or couldn’t, understand. Rather than just two guitars, bass, drums, and vocals, like the old days, there was multiple layering of guitar tracks, the vocals were played with sound-wise, the lyrics aren’t about hating this or that (as the name may suggest) but about NOT hating something because it just isn’t worth it in the end. It was almost a song about positive, soulful, affirmation. Hold it guys, getting into *shudder* Savage Garden territory there! But it was still “balls hanging out” rock and whatever anyone else thought be damned!  The most excellent song on the album though would have to be ‘The Outlaw Torn’. This is Metallica going back to their old epic ways, touching it up a bit with their new ways, and letting loose on a 9 minute track about pain, love, regrets, shame, pride and revenge. From the slow build up at the beginning to the instrumental-like ending this song just won’t end until you’re left drained from going with the guys on their musical odyssey.  ‘The Outlaw Torn’ pretty much sums up the entire album. It’s an album about love in all it’s guise be they painful, hateful, sorrowful, and any other something-ful you can think of to throw in there.  Overall, the album was better than their other albums in some ways (more mature-minded, deeper psychological subject matter) but left something to be desired in others. As I said, it was Metallica in mid-life crisis mode and this is the end result. An album that, left to its own merits, succeeds very well, but when compared to the expectations left by the “Black” album falls just short of the mark. It would take another 12 years after the release of the “Black” album for them to bring out another album that would once again redefine the hard rock/metal genre and prove to the world that they weren’t a bunch of middle-age Rolling Stone wannabes. They were (and are) a musical force to be reckoned with.  So, in finishing, I hope I haven’t bored you to death with this. If you have any comments, please feel free to leave them on the comments section, and if you own “Load” get it off the shelf, whack it into the CD player and give it a burl. And if you don’t own it, go out and get it.  Rating: 7.5/10
