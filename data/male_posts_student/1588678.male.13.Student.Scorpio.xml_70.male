I'll hopefully get a band together, too (if I'm lucky). I already play guitar, write my own songs with words and music, and make demo tapes in my bedroom. I have at least 10 different demos ready for people to play or even PEOPLE TO BUY!!! Okay, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but still, hopefully I'll get a band together.  I also hope to listen to some good tunes. I'm looking forward to Cake's new album due-out in August. And other good albums like Dead Kennedys "Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death" and Nirvana "In Utero" I will probably listen to over and over again! I'll just wait and see.  MOVIES - Many good movies coming out this summer. I'll make up a list later. But, I'll be at the movies non-stop.   PLACES TO GO - Maybe we'll make a trip up to Tahoe for a week. If so, that'll be a good way to spend a part of my summer.  Okay, this list may seem dinky, but I'll come up with more. For now, I'll continue planning.   Later.
