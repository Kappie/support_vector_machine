Is going extremely well, like I've only been playing since *thinks* probably like... end of January... properly you know. And I know a bunch of songs (easy stuff, some just rythem) but its perfect for me cause I only want to be a rythem guitarist so Im happy with how Im doing at the moment. I even have my first gig-type thing, Im working with my friends band (he asked me to do rythem) for the school's rock show type thing, I'm going to be playing Buck Rogers by Feeder and possibly All My Life by the Foo Fighters. Xav on drums (which is wierd cause he's an amazing guitarist), Nick on lead guitar, Lee on bass and me on rythem. So yeah I'm pretty proud of how far I have come in the past months with my guitar, Nick said he's even thinking about asking me to become a full member. Things in my life are doing alright, kind of full lately, plans-wise, me and Charli are doing okay, had a few problems as of late, its not full sorted-out but I guess we need to take it a step at a time. Had like the biggest mis-haps the other day, I was texting that girl because she was upset I hadnt text her in ages and I put "you know I loves you really" and in one of them movie-type moments - I sent it to Charli. It was okay in the end, Charli did'nt take it the wrong way - thank god. Okay anyhow yeah so were doing okay, not bad I guess. Music: Lately I have been once again on my nonstop-Nirvana phase, Im absoloutly amazed at Bleach. I've had it for a while like - a long time but latelty I'm listening to it every chance I get. I had some emo kid walk up to me in the middle of town the other day, you the typical kind - long (unwashed looking) blonde-Cobain-esque hair, a t-shirt with "Kurt D. Cobain - 1962 to 1994" on it, huge baggy jeans with rips all over, pale skin and a generally - "I'm so depressed, its fucking rediculous, my parents hate me, I have no friends, I wish I could die but in reality I dont im just doing this for attention yet Im extremely out-spoken so its pretty obvious Im not depressed" looking face. Had ago at me for wearing a GLC t-shirt, started claiming it wasn't "music", I asked him what was and he named Blink, Nirvana and the such. He started claiming how GLC were a disgrace to music, one thing I pointed out to the mook was that GLC IS music, its just a different form that doesnt go on about heartache so he can cry his fucking eyes out to it. Two he wouldnt have a clue what music was even if it hit him in the face, there are alot more forms of music that pop-punk and grunge and such. GLC - becoming quite popular, I remember the first time I heard about them - my brother told me about them after he went to their first gig and I went on their site and downloaded some music of theirs and I found it absoloutly hilarious, a townie talked to me about them the other day asking me if I had heard Half-Man Half-Machine and when I said "yeah like... half a year ago" he would'nt believe me - odd fellow, Half-Man Half-Machine  isn't their best either I personally LOVE I Want My GLC. Anyhow today I have a VERY busy day I got to do my tutor session soon, so that should be cool which just reminded me I got to go and do a past paper. I got to go out with Charli then and then back to my house for half-six to go out with Phil - my god... what-a-day! So long my Children... oh wait, Van Helsing its pretty good, very cool and has some great story in and Egor is the bloody man! Bye kids!
