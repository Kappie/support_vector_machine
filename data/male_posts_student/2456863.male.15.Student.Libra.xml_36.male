"Du, Du hasst, Du hasst mich" doesnt exactly work well for a dance... of course most people don't know it means you hate me.  I swear i heard gehst somewhere in there though...  I've decided, after looking through my journal, i'm not gonna post those poems (Actually i'm kinda a litttle embarrased by some parts...) I suppose a select few may one day read them, but not in this blog.  I am gonna put some other old ones in though.  If you havent figured it out yet, shorts are my word for short phrases, usually advice, that sometimes mean things more than what they say.  When I'm dead maybe they'll show up as quotes in daily planners.... lol  Today I have a few new ones (all entirely mine).  Experience is the best communicator.  The one with penitence makes the best of companions.   Some of the original shorts:  Love All, Serve All, Trust All, Forgive All. (Of course) The first part is from Hard Rock's slogan, as you probably know.  If you're going through Hell, keep moving. A sign outside a church in Hayward, this one caught my eye too.  You Booze, You Cruise, You Loose. This one was on a billboard on the way to Hayward (I've mentioned that before) And I liked it, so it became a short.   This one isn't a short, because to me shorts are things i've said or think, or things i've seen, but not quotes.  So this is considered a quote, but it means quite a bit when you read over the words (it's kinda like reading between the lines, its a mellonism):  Not all those who wander are lost. This one goes to Tolkien, I love Gandalf and Aragorn's rhetoric! I usually leave out the those, it sounds better when it's by itself.  It comes this, in the Fellowship:  All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king.
