Earlier i had pw meeting that was rather unproductive as one of the pple who was supposed to come didnt come and he had the pw file. So i just sat there and stoned, while the girls chatted away (One of lingzhi's friends came) In the end managed to do 2 group evaluations.  Last sat, went for scouts stepping up ceremony to see the juniors (sec 3's) take over the sec 4's role. Hm i remember exactly one year ago when i stepped down and left the scout unit, hai how fast 1 year flies by.... now theres about 2 months to promos and i still in a slacky mood. i had to leave sji at 5 and rushed off to town to meet the other lawnbowlers, we then took a bus and rode for a long rige.(45) min to our coach house for our seniors j2 farewell. Haha i ate lots of food, had fun playing tai ti, watched hellboy, saw the girls play mahjong( i have no idea how to play that) got home at about 2330.  Sunday cant really remember much, generally stayed at home to study for tests.  Monday was napha test day. Due to photo taking , our class got delayed, in the end had to continue after school.. which ended at 510 !! hm i think i did alrite this year, better than last year, hm situps 45, standing broad jump 226cm , pullups 6, shuttle run 10.1 secs, sit and reach 34 cm, 2.4 Km run 12.16 mins///overall silver i hope..  most impressive for pullups goes to..................Byron and Samuel the musclemen, they did close to 40 pullups combined. FOr shuttlerun, junjie is undisputed champ with his sliding technique and time of 9.2 seconds, 2.4 Km run champion is byron/joel all around 9.30 min  Tuesday erm cant really rememeber much, wednesday was erm careers day for j2s. J1 timetable was for all of us to take a gp test in the morning which i think i did badly and after that was another pw block period where we were more interested in getting ready for the maths retest. Had lunch and then proceeded to the lt for a 3 hour maths paper, what the heck my butt was pain after everything was over, 3 hours of torture.  Thursday came home and slept for like 3 hours in the afternoon. Managed to update cs 1,6 which took AGES and i mean AGES like a few hours, could barely do my work as a result of that.  Friday was a day of fun, starting out after school where the class went to seoul garden at bugis for lunch. The place was packed man, and the food rox.. Ate until super full, we did some crazy stuff like bbqing the orange, jelly which melted into a pile of goo, brendan my classmate actually ate one of the bbqed oranges -_-"'. Joel our htc did some ridicolous things like putting fruits like watermelon together with the raw meat. OVerall very enjoyable. After that went home for nap before heading to sji for ap. Hm this year got some very glaring faults but overall was still ok. Watching it brought back memories of me in the field marching last year. After that headed to town with two of my good buddies to play...pool not something i am good at. Hm after 8 months in jc, i have only played pool 3 times... that sort of tells u how good/lousy i am. But the place at cineleisure was a rip off at 8.80 an hour, we stayed there for 2 hours and left the place at 2245. Reached home at 2320.
