The check, my inheiritance from some distant aunt or great aunt of mine who I never met before she died, will pay for the car that I am currently driving. That will happen soon, when the lease runs out and I buy off the car. Plus I will have a little (about 500) left from interest and leftover that I can use towards a large purchase. So even though I never met this lady, she has impacted my life in a very big and positive way. I can only hope to do things along the same lines.
