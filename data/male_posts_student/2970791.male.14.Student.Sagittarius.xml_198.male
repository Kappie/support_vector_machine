You will save yourself much explaining and stuttering and awkwardness this way 2. TRY to remember where you left your bag - they have a tendency to move around 3. learn how to open your locker rather than having someone else do it all year long 4. Never volunteer if you don't know what you will be doing 5. Be creative with your excuses 6. continuation of #5: become emotional 7. DON'T GIVE PEOPLE YOUR PENS (YOU WILL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN) 8. Visible bra straps are a no-no 9. The same goes for clear dresses 10. Don't be downwright mean to anyone without proper contemplation - you might need them to do something for you later 11. When in doubt, employ the phrase "I didn't do it!" 12. be inconspicuous when chewing illegal gum 13. Always get out of running laps - again, be creative and remember, it's all in the timing... 14. Make friends with the lunch people 15. Wear the specified socks  16. EVERYTHING has a loophole - it's your job to find them 17. listen to everyones advice and then promptly disregard it (haha ms. V and the box projects) 18. remember that you will be seeing these people almost every day for the next year - be nice to them 19. inside jokes will not seem funny when you tell them to others - hence the name inside jokes. And...last but not least... 20. Stand out  I hope you all feel very knowledgable now. --feel free to post your own knowledge you acquired this year
