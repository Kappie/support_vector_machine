As I opened the door to our hydroroom, I wasgreeted by the most foul and horrificodourever...and about 20 flies! Disgusting! I would havekilled all 20 flies myself, if it weren't for the horridsmell. So I call environmental services to take care of the situation, just to find out that these small brownish black flies arean endangered species. They are the infamous delhi sand flies of Colton, California. And there is a $10, 000 fine if one is caught killing them.Ludicrous! By this time, several bewilderedpatients are waiting to be treated in the hydroroom. Administration decides to shut down the hydroroom until a county environmentalist is available to assess the situation.   I find this absurdly humorous. I could understand if it were a spotted owl, but come on now. One word... RAID ! Whatever happened to hospitalhygiene? Afterall, I do work in an hospital and one of our main goals is infection control.   So the next time you spot a brownish black fly with a banded yellow abdomen and green bulgy eyes, I would think twice about swatting them.
