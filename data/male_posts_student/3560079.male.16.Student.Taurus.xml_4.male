And I have found some really weird inventions on this site,  urlLink Bad-Inventions .  I have to show you two of the best I have found:    Ig you have lost all your butter knives.   For those who ReallY don't wanna get wet.  Some other cool inventions:  urlLink  Unuseless Inventions  - Look at the t-shirt ;)  Some things look really cool, I wish I was such a good inventor =)
