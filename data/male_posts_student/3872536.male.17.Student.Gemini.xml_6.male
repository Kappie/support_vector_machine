Went to my Temasek Sec to collect my 'O' levels cert early in the morning lor. Stepped out of my house with my huge bag containing the stuff for my camp etc. Went to the void deck and my bag was torn lol, so haf to repack my stuff. Initially, I'm suppose to meet Jia Yin to go collect cert together de but ended up she has to go first lol. After which went back TJ for maths mass tutorial. So sian lor coz our maths tutor has already gone through most of the questions liao but it's ok coz i copied many things wrongly during her lesson lol... Then the camp begins... The beginning of the camp was like quite messy lah coz it's hard to gather pple lor. Then station masters are supposed to reach the destinated place liao, but i still haf to stay in TJ to help clear the hall tat's packed wif chairs and tables lor. Then I went thr alone to clear the chairs as i haf nuthing to do in the canteen wat. Rather do something then slack there lol. Then Esmond, lai wei and leonard came and i left for my station. SO satisfied wif myself lor coz i actually managed to reach clarke quake alone lor. As u all noe i'm rather poor when it comes to direction and mrt system lol. Then reach clarke quake liao and found out tat the station masters thr were having lunch at liang court, where i duno how to go and haf to ask the other grp tat reached to bring my thr lol... I wonder who's playing the urban hunt lol... Nevertheless, I enjoyed it :P At clarke quake thr, we actually made the grps sing the school song at the bungee area lol and it was somehow quite sian coz thr's not many pple thr lor, except the pple at the ticket booth. And i rmb one of the pple in charge of the bungee was actually saying their singing can't make it lol... Rather fun thr lol coz we made them do couple dance and sing and do handsigns 4 the leo theme song: Shimmering with love... Rather tired after that.After which we went back to TJ to haf our dinner and if i'm not mistaken it's chicken rice. Pple thr were like not realli tat considerate coz some beings ate more than 1 pack lor then ended up most committee members didn't get to haf it and still there are pple complaining the chicken rice ish not enuff lor... Hiaz sian... If only they noe our plight man... Then the night games begins... Kai Tze(if i spelt correctly) and i were in the same grp lor and we r in charge of the games whereby pple haf to gather in their grps blindfolded and recognising their grp mates using a hand sign lor. Then I think we realli enjoyed playing coz we tried to learn their handsigns and try to be in their grp, after which we lead them round the whole area lol.... Then I oso pulled their ears and tapped their head while their playing lol... So fun... Haha... Despite some confusion wif the grping thing, i think the game was quite successful lol... We had supper after all the games lor, and some of the committee were preparing MILO lor.. Haha wif miss wong's help, the milo was rather nice... Then here comes the real nightmare!!! John one of the member was complaining bout one of the game, obituaries, whereby the committee mistakenly put the photo of a living ex-president under one of the obitaries lor. He oso complained about the station at BUgis where pple haf to make themselves wet. He complained about getting himself wet lor and say the chlorine in the water will harm his ears and nose etc... Despite the whole committee apologising to him, he still continue scolding us lor. Realli duno wat's wrong wif him lor sian... Ok lah enuff of him liao. Dun let him spoil my mood again... The whole committee didn't get any sleep tat day lor except 4 a few lor. Most were playing games while i'm doing a flash animation of the photos taken for the concert the day after. Finish the stuff at bout 6 something bout but haiz... can't present it coz it lag too much liao... Sian... All my hard work out to waste man...   12/6--- Day 2 of the camp..  Again... Preparing breakfast for pple lor... Then tat lw wanted mi to conduct pt wif him lor, but i rejected coz i was helping out wif the breakfast and was like so damn tired coz stare at the com the whole night lor. I noe lw was tired oso lah... Anyway sorry lor... Then the day games begin... I was in charge of the blackjack thing lah whereby the winning team gets to pour (either water, soya sauce, flour or chilli, at least 2) on the lossing team lor. Then the grps damn cute lor. Some allied, some pour on the sleeves or legs and many say oppss... and pour the ding into the drain lor... After tat go help jia yin tat station, whereby i get to enjoy myself thr lor coz we were like pouring soya sauce into the water and pouring it to the committee while waiting 4 the grps lor... Hmm.. Still rmb my head has the soya sauce smell after tat... Haha... Jia Yin and kai Tze were oso wet lor... Then junming and jia yin went to see other station lor... Leaving mi alone thr to clear up the stuff thr lor moving tables, washing tables and clearing the mess thr lor... After which went back to canteen to rest a while when lw ask mi to help carry tables from the sports complex lor. He must mi thinking i'm like slacking thr the whole while lor... Anyway sorri again... Then go help carry the tables back to the classrm lor. Then prepare dinner or rather serving dinner liao... Ms wong actually gave out too much rice initially then the rice nor enuff and some pple and the whole committee didn't get to eat the rice lor. Luckily thr're some chicken and eggs etc left behind. Then here somes the concert. The concert was somehow quite successful lah except tat our committee performance wunt that perfect lor... I'm so glad the pple and most importantly the seniors were saying that the door gifts we prepared were nice lor... Wat to do i was the project ic lol...  3 cheers and 3 cheers for the committee... Though it was not a perfect camp we've prepared, but i truely think we've realli gone all out to our max liao lor. So good job man... Though thr might be some misunderstandins among the committee, but pple it's all over and we've reached our destination.... Though some may not be pleased wif us, wif the camp, but it's already the best we can do... Nv look down on yrself Kai Tze... U've always been a good food IC man... Dun let some hurting words obstruct u from moving to greater heights.... Once again... Great job man.... And most importantly i get to noe more pple (esp. gals lol)   13/6--- Resting day..  Hmm.. sorri 4 not writing blog coz i slept early and woke up late. Then went to support kim heng for the vege fiesta ding lor... As a friend who's known him for many yrs, I went to support him lor. And he realli did a great job coz he was the overall ic for the games section... Now i noe how bad my skills were, coz i get quite low pts lol... Nevertheless, i enjoyed tat... Thanks for inviting mi... After tat went new house do deal wif some stuff till bout 7 ba... After which, come back home to deal wif the curtain ding and slept... A rather short yet meaningful day 4 mi man...   14/6--- Slacking..  Initially I planned to mug today de but my motivation's not thr lor.. Then ended up slacking, watching tv and sleeping lol...
