I don't have a fever...the thermometer must be wrong.  I just didn't get enough sleep last night.  Then I go into a coughing fit for the next ten minutes.  I feel better today but I still have a fever.  I haven't eaten anything in the last three days except a slice of toast.  I wasn't hungry but my dad shoved the bread down my throat.  The worst part of being sick is missing school.  I really don't like to miss school because I hate making everything up.  I already got my homework for Thursday and Friday and most of it is done.  It is just the idea of missing school that I dont' like.  The other thing that really bothers me about being sick is the germs.  I feel like my house has been infested and I can't get away from the stupid germs that are eating at my flesh.  I am obsessive when it comes to cleanliness when I am in perfect health.  Well, if you can believe it, it gets worse when I am sick.  I don't want anyone else to get sick or for there to be any lingering germs to re-infect me.  Therefore I take precautions.  I wash my hands at least once every hour, usually two or three times.  Of course, I only use paper towels to dry my hands and then I immediately throw them away.  I also carry around a can of Lysol disinfecting spray.  I drench anything I touch: doorknobs, lightswitches, the remote, my calculator, pens, the little twisty thing on the lamp, my keyboard and mouse, the buttons on the trash compactor, the recievers to all of the telephones that I used,  and anything else that dares to look at me.  I was going to spray the pitcher that my orange juice is in but my mom didn't think it would be a good idea to risk drinking Lysol.  I am a little bit bored but for the most part I am just sick of being sick.
