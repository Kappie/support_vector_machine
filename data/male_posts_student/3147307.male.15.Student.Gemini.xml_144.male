Here are the standings - if you want a detailed explanation of the rating for a specific blog just ask in the comments. Remember that frequency is only 35% so like Allen's blog didn't just get a 0. If I do this on a week by week basis he would've. Here goes: 16.  urlLink Ellen Edwards  10/100  15.  urlLink Ryan Cerbus  33/100  14.  urlLink Allen Blackwood  38/100  13.  urlLink Grace Hanson  39/100  12.  urlLink Christy Helweg  44/100  11.  urlLink Abby Elder  47/100  The Top 10!  10.  urlLink Mia Straw  49/100  9.  urlLink Eleni Elder  51/100  8.  urlLink Mary Ray  52/100  7.  urlLink Hannah Ray  58/100  6.  urlLink Rebekah Ray  62/100  5.  urlLink Charity Blackwood  62/100  4.  urlLink Patrick Blue  63/100  3.  urlLink Joe Ray  68/100  2.  urlLink Ashley Rusk  70/100  And the #1 blog from the Southside is...  1.  urlLink Katie Bussell  82/100  Remember just ask about different blogs and I'll tell you. and remember 62/100 (an F grade?) or whatever doesn't mean you have a bad blog my scale was harsh. I'd say anything above 60 is good.
