It actually downloads music it doesn't have. We were laughing our asses off when it played our selection of  Bad Religion 's "I Love My Computer." We also had some Social D and the Police going. I think that machine could be very dangerous if we were really drunk.  We also went to BJs and and some pizza and more beer... BJ's pizza rules. It kicks my homemade pizza to the curb, but then again my pizza is cheaply made.  Tonight I'm going clubbing with the girls, to have some fun before Flo goes off to Texas.  Yes... me going clubbing...  ***
