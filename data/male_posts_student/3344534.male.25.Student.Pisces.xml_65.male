Red , Treble Charger  Saw you looking for a light Face painted cigarette white You asked the cleanest boy you found You couldn't see me turned around His fingers stretched across your empty gaze That I just can't escape  As the red fades from your wrinkled dress A picture of the people you've impressed Hangs on a wall around here Vision starts to crawl when I'm near And the evening waits  While you get caught up to your own mistakes Made up different lines I wouldn't wanna keep in my mind  I wondered why you'd come around Remembering your little girl frown Your answers kept the crowd at bay With compliments unwilling to pay I had some things I'd like to say to you But they just can't be true
