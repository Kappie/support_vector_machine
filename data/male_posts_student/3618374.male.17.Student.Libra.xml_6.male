How can I practice if I can't raise a pencil to write stuff? Goddamnit, even typing hurts. No fun at all.  Interesting week, this past one! I've really gone to lots of things lately. Stampede, rock concerts, movies, stuff that costs a lot of money. I have one month until I'm coming into a lot of the green stuff. A wireless company that my father and I invest in (nameless for insider trading purposes) is coming public soon! Going to sell shares. I don't know how much I'm going to come into exactly, but it's probably around the area of 35 000 for the investment! So barring any unforeseen consequences, I'm going to walk out of this summer, not working, with a whole fucking ton of money. That's really, really good news. I love the Calgary Stampede. It's my favourite time of year. I don't even really like to do anything there, I just like the atmosphere. Usually, people are happy! That's more than I can say most times of the year, because people are jerks most of the time. If you weigh more than 180 pounds, don't fucking crowdsurf at concerts. At Tea Party the other night (which was just terrific, by the way), this 300 pound native guy was crowdsurfing. I immediately hauled him down and (I think) broke his nose. Concert justice, baby. I don't even like crowdsurfers at all .It ruins the concert when you've got shit coming overhead. Moshing fine! At least you don't have to watch out behind you for silly motherfuckers coming over the top. Tea Party was great. They're definetly one of my favourite bands. You know a band is great when they can play an hour and a half without ONE crappy song. When I went to Default on Sunday, half the songs were complete shit. Hell, only a couple were good! You could go to a high school battle of the bands and seriously see better bands than Default. I hate all this Creed, Nickleback, Default, Theory of a Deadman shit. Pearl Jam has already done the same style of music, only about ten million times better. Because Pearl Jam is awesome. And Nickleback blows nuts.  There needs to be more GOOD music in the mainstream. I love all styles, don't get me wrong. I'll take good hip-hop, good rock and roll, clever classicalor the swingingest jazz on the planet. Just make it good.  Jazz on the radio sucks too. Half, right away, is that Kenny G shit. Charlie Parker started doing heroin in the 1940's because he foresaw the ruining of jazz by Kenny G. I don't mind some of the poppier stuff, I think David Sanborn is awesome, but man, Kenny G licks nuts. Miles Davis is turning over and over in his goddamn grave.  And Hip Hop? It's a joke! The only people that are worthwhile out there are Me'shelle and Ice Cube. Where did the NWA, Public Enemy, even fucking Fresh Prince go? That is quality music. Classical isn't that great nowadays either. Now that everything has been done, all the writing in the last twenty years has been Mozart and Shostakovich rehashed (even though those two have nothing to do with each other). I'm tired of contrived, frustrated music. I want something I can listen to on more a visceral level (such as rock or rap) and something maybe more intellectually stimulating (jazz or classical) but it's all going to shit. Time to go buy some cds, fellas.
