Photo's coming soon!  I have recently discovered that I am addicted to cheeseburgers. Yes I know, the ones from fast food outlets with meat patties made of anything BUT meat, and uber-fake pieces of cheese flavoured plastic. Yes I am ashamed to say, I am addicted to them. I know it's bad for me, now I know what a heroin junkie feels like. Next thing I know, I'll be in a hoodie, fumbling twenty dollars over the counter of Mc Donalds. After my downward spiral into cheeseburger addiction I'll become an obese nymphomaniac. Then will come my triumphant return from a Mc Donalds Rehabilitation Centre.   Maybe the life of a cheeseburger junkie aint that bad afterall. You like to chacha? I sure do.  Logging off for now.  Colin
