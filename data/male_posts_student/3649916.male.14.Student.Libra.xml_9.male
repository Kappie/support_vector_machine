I went to the river one day but then i just found out that i cannot swim in river water because i just hyperventelate so i cannot breathe because of my asthma which really really sucks. Then my friend went on vacation so i have jack shit to do. The population on the shard i play on UO is slowly decreasing and everyone is moving into some shitty protected places, which sucks. My sister is gone for the week so i am happy though, i can still collect bods in my game so i still will be very happy lol, i collect 6 every bod run lol. and you can only get 1 for each char every 6 hours hehe. there was an earthquake here yesterday, well i am too tired to speak anymore right now so i will talk to you later  Chris  listening to : its been awhile by staind
