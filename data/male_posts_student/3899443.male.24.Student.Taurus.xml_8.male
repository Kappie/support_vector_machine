I wonder if the loser misses out on the rapture and is forced to spend eternity on a post-apocalyptic earth (insert your own joke about New Jersey).  How do you market a game like that? Imagine being in the marketing meeting trying to come up with slogans for the game.   “You’re not just playing to win, you’re playing for your life.”  “Buy the board game or Kirk Cameron will make a sequel. Go ahead; test us.”  “The most important board game – ever.”  “The board game that will save your friends from hell.”   I wonder if they have  Left Behind  lunchboxes?
