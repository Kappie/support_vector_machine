I think that about the best that can be said is that the inelligence community failed miserably (which is an incredibly valid criticism and one that hasn't been addressed adequately at this point), but Bush certainly didn't lie.    UPDATE:  Here is another opinion with some good links that basically say  urlLink this isn't the whole story  and there is much more behind the scenes.
