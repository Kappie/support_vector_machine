I guess, then, it's far easier to view my life as always being good then.  I waited all day to check the cast list for FNL, and I didn't get in.  I was almost sure I did, oh well.  It didn't irk me to much, because Liza got in.  She danced, didn't make any jokes.  The judges overall let in who they wanted in, and I knew that.  My only hope would be they wanted me more.  Oh well, only one black guy in FNL then.    Of course my gain was much more personal, suffice to say I was talking to a friend and it ends up, things may be falling in my favor if worked right.  Hopefully they will be.  I don't want to say much more on that strand though.
