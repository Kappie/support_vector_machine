But I really like watching them change people's rooms into either a disaster or something pretty cool. A lot of them really turn out bad, though... here's an example:          Oh Dangit! It's all white!... I didn't see this episode, so I don't know if they liked it, but that thing is hideous! Anyway, just wanted to share that with you guys... I'm off to youth group...  L8r!
