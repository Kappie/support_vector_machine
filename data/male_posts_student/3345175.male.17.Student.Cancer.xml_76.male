Of course there is a lot of room for spontaneity...heehee...the GOOD kind! ;)   This weekend is Alice's big (but by-invitation-only) P.A.R. TAY! So me and Arlene are going Cathouse-ing before it, and then catching a train back to Blantyre. Fun-ness! (Daniels bloody influence)  I have the Summer sorted. SYT. Lotsa fun.  And of course, for my 17th birthday i will be dragging a good twenty or so people to the Cathouse from SYT, school, and Daniel...lol. Itll be the best night ever if it manages to top last year's similar outing for my 16th.   And ill be getting lots of presents [devious smirk] Mwaha, Mwahaha, MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!!   Next year ill be taking up dance lessons again, whilst holding down a job, going to the gym, doing weekend SYT acting classes and still managing my two highers and two advanced highers.   Why did i post this? Its the biggest amount of shit EVER!
