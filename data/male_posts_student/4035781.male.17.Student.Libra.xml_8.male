Read for a while, had a good sleep in, walked for a few hours and had some photo's developed.  A lot turned out well, if I can be bothered to scan some I might post them here. Good times there. I resolve to take more pictures from now on, now that we have a digital camera. There's like none of me from the past five years.  My legs seem to  be on the path to recovery, I must attempt to keep myself from overstretching them at karate tonight.  Wouldn't kill people to me more friendly, these past few days it seems the majority of people have got something stuck up their arse and it's grating on my nerves. I should like to see Danielle sometime soon, Karen been talking about it and I haven't seen her and Josh since school. Looking forward to hanging out tommorow, dreading another eight hour shift on saturday. Oh well, that's life. All I can do is face it headon.
