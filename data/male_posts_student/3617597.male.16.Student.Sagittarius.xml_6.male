At the moment im single and wish not to be, long brown hair, brown eyes and a bit of a individual (ie liking things my own way and being non-conformist and non-ordinary) My previous life has consisted of farrrr to many female friends.....but they are the best friends i cud ever ask for. So i wud like to say thanks to such friends as Kate and Ellie.I have good long term relationships with friends and prefer not to fall out with anyone so i am neutral in that respect.  Im doing my GCSE exams which im finding hard as im sure many other people out there are. So this is my first entry and i want to keep this up.  DAVE XXX
