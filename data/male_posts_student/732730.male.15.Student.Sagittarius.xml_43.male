That last sentance was really redundant...    Adam the checkout operator   I was abused by customers today. Fuckin tossers. SHE WAS A 85 YEAR OLD TOO! How demeaning...    Adam the student   Pfft, schools fine. Except for German, where I'm  really  not putting the hours     Adam the boyfriend   Ha! I wish...    Adam the web designer   I finished by Big Brother 5 web layout prototype. It looks swanky. Over the next few days I'll be recoding  urlLink Mogenic  with CSS and XHTML. Right now it's a steaming pile of shit.    Adam the gamer   Some time soon I should be getting Counter-Strike: Source over  urlLink Steam . Yay!
