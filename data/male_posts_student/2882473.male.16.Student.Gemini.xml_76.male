All that writing... and so little time to write it in... and the 15 mark questions... and the boiling weather outside... and when I have the last one  urlLink megatrobe  will already be on summer break. And I WILL BE IN BUSINESS! :( :( :( I think that deserves at least three unhappy faces.  Anywho, closer to the moment, I have a biology extension exam tomorrow, at 0830. That will be tough. I have kind of revised it, there are three chapters (that number has cropped up three times (four now) in my post already... strange... a conspiracy maybe?) that are in the revision guide that need learning, and I have spent most of the morning going over them, trying desperately to remember the difference between phyagcytes and lymphocytes. Fortunately, I now remember what they both are. Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf and digest antigens, and lymphocytes are white blood cells that produce anti-bodies to deal with the antigens. And then of course there are two types of lymphocytes, B and T types, each of which do different jobs. (At this point,  urlLink Dickybod  and  urlLink Deutsches  should be VERY grateful they don't need to know this stuff. But then I am doing tripple science, and will of course get that extra grade at the end of it all... *smirks*)  Business! ARGHHHHH!  urlLink Deutsches   and  urlLink Nonnesuch   and  urlLink Wendy  will all feel my pain though, as they too had to sit through three hours per week of the horror that was business studies (there's that number again). Still, only three (and again) and a half hours of the subject left... ever. Well, for me and Nonnesuch. I'm not sure about the other two. So far, I've spent about 10 minutes revising business, which I'm sure is no-where near enough... but it's the most boring of boring subjects there are. Example. How could Mr  urlLink Boring   improve his profitabilty so that he could make his firm even more boring than it is? (10 marks) *glance at clock - 2 minutes to do it in* And there will be three (again...) exmas of that. The horror, the horror...   I have probably put the most links in this post than I have in any other. Meh, felt it was worth mentioning.  Well, best be off, no need moaning about it, that won't do anything. But then, I am a moaner after all. :)   Weather Some cloud, fairly hot. Glad I wasn't in that maths exam earlier...  Reading:  Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban  Listening to:  Playlist 'Good Stuff'  Watching:  Nowt  Confused about:  Bio stuff  Annoyed with:  BUSINESS! ARGHHHH!  Mood:  Panicky, I need to revise business more... but the horror...
