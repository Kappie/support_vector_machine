We weren't even close to the peak of our games, and we unleashed a torrent of video karate so devastating they resorted to juvenile tricks and name-calling. It was rad, to say the least. It's a funny thing, because I was over at my mom's house earlier and the whole family was talking trash about how good they were. And they pretty much sucked. My teammates played like heroes and I am intensely proud of them for helping me show the Goat who the better person (people) is (are).  Afterwards me and Chris and Bryce laid back in my car, and had a good conversation about true friendship. Me and Chris are intensely pissed off at Erik for ditching fighting the Goat, his mortal enemy, for some girls that are going back to Chicago tomorrow.   What makes a good friend? Do they always tell you what is right, what you want to hear, or a combination of both? Are they there for you? Will they go and get messed up over some girl and ditch you? I don't know, man, but we ranted about Erik for probably an hour before T. Plumb started yelling at us.   Turns out my stalkers are back. Now they know my address, but I doubt they'll actually come here.  Iced tea tastes disgusting but for some reason I drink it anyway.  It seems to be a day (well, night now) of digressions, as I can't seem to concentrate on anything. I've had a headache for a while, and it is starting to make me irritable.  I need some new music. Whenever my life feels stale, new music always livens it up. When I get paid on Thursday I'm going to buy some CDs.  Got pulled over by the law tonight.  I feel like tonight was a victory. Not just because we popped the Goat's ego balloon, but because now I can move on with summer. I hate how summer is just a series of points you look forward to, and when one passes you just move on to the next and forget about the days in between. I haven't had a truly pointless day yet this summer, and I doubt I will. Whenever I am doing something, whatever it is, chances are there is a reason I am doing it. A deep, mysterious, mystical reason.   Nah. Just a normal reason.  Boy, do I get irritable if no one pays attention to me. I just realized that.   The new Bad Religion CD hits the streets on Tuesday, which is about important to me as getting laid by the Chicago girls is to Erik.  You know who sucks? UPS. I ordered my stuff on Wednesday, and it still hasn't came.  Back to the stalkers: Hannah and Kali really bother me. I hate how Hannah calls me bitter, how Kali talks to me like a little kid, how conservative Hannah is, how Kali has to always ask me what I'm doing tonight, how Hannah secretly tapes me and makes projects out of it, how Kali never leaves me alone, how they seem to ambush me whenever they see me, etc. I could go on all night, probably. Oh yeah, and they're music snobs. Kali lives next to Houley, and I had to drop a map off at Houley's today. Anyway, she had her Graduation party today, and I had to do this sneaky Mission:Impossible shit to get around her house without being seen, lest I be sucked into that menagerie of indie music and uncomfortable, personal, probing questions. God, I hope they don't come to my house.  I need to find someone to hang out with tomorrow. If you want to hang out with me, post or call or something. My phone will be on quiet until I wake up, around one or two.  This blog always seems strangely impersonal to me. I'm glad people are starting to come around that your thoughts can be posted here safely. It's like some wacky "safety zone" or something. What happens here, stays here. Unless it is someone else, in which case I will spread it everywhere I go.  I can rant like no other. I've been ranting about Erik and John for probably the past week, but I am getting sick of that and will move on to something else. I usually interrupt my conversations with some comments about what I'm pissed off at at that moment.  Seriously though, I'm pissed at Erik.  After my blog I either read or watch Adult Swim. I'm reading a really rad collection of short stories right now, but I'll probably watch Adult Swim allowing that it is Sunday night and Mission Hill is on at 2:30 (Yes!).  I'm a really bad night owl. I usually don't fall asleep until three or four in the morning. The reason is because I spend a lot of time in bed thinking. During the school year I usually repress my thoughts after a good hour of thinking but during the summer I let my train of thought run for as long as it pleases. Just laying there thinking is very relaxing, and it is easier to sort my thoughts out and plan for the next day. A lot of things I think about in bed are posted here later on.  I'd like to bring more people into the blogger fold but I can't think of anyone who'd want to. Maybe Bryce. I like talking to Bryce because he has a lot of interesting insights, and when you've heard the same old story from your other friends he'll say what everyone is thinking.     It has only been summer for a while but I already feel relaxed. Good for me.  Maybe I'll post in the day tomorrow. I always say I will, but I'd rather do something in the daytime.  Until tomorrow.
