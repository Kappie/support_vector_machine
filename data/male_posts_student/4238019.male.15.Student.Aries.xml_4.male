I love school, although I hate some boring lessons. But without school, will there be life? The answer is No. If there is no school, there will be no frens.(am i teaching a lesson or writing my diary of the day??) hahaa... ok. I'll start today's diary then. the first three periods of the day is Chinese. 2 hrs long man. Today is the Chinese "ying yong wen" test. For those who havent take the test and taking it tommorrow, it is lucky that u read frm my webby. hehehe. There are two questions, choose one(obviously -.-). First question, write a letter to the principal to inform him about staying school in the evening to study. Second question, write a letter to your friend to explain that there are many misunderstandings between your friend and you, and write to apologise to him. Ok. All the best to the Chinese students taking the "ying yong wen" test tommorrow. At the same time, I got back the Chinese test paper today. I got 29/100 overall for Chinese ( cool huh? pro rite? ) haha.. Today Ms Mel nvr come, so got 4 periods of free time. In addition, I got back my A & E Maths test paper too(Pentitium 1 lag, my classmates got theirs yesterday and I just got mine today). I got 8/10 for A Maths( heard that I was the highest, hey hey :X) and 9/10 for E Maths. During recess, I reminded myself not to eat chicken or anything spicy, as instructed by the doctor. In the end, I ate fishball noodles and a few packets of seaweed. The venue of classrooms had changed last Thursday that Pure Geography classroom and Social Studies classroom have been moved into the two aircon rooms on the 3rd level, beside the boys toilet. Yeah! Nothing much taught in school today, had fun. But quite alot of homework to do. *Sigh* Tommorrow is also English Comprehension Test for CA2. Make sure 3e3 do their best so that they'll pass and do well for English. Ok, today's sEaN's bloggie will end here. Be sure to come here tommorrow to read more of my bloggie.. Thank you. :P
