Its what I do best so I got right to it. Although perhaps sleeping until 2pm today was a little excessive maybe?  Anyway don't ask me why I felt like creating a place on the net for all my thoughts and rantings, but I have to put them somewhere, save moaning about them to everyone else, which I'm sure they don't appreciate as much as they say they do. So here seemed like a good place. I realise a lot of people like to keep a secret diary, but that is very, well, secretive and how can I be expected to rant and rave and reminisce about things to people in a private diary? So here is where I shall empty my many thoughts.   I suppose I should apologize now to the Blogger people for filling their servers with a load of anarchistic nonsense but perhaps, in parts, a few gold nuggets of truth and wisdom may escape into my typing fingers.  Good Afternoon.
