For a long time I didn't entertain the idea of putting up a blog...I mean what does one write? And who has time to write everyday and who's gonna read all this? I mean seriously, people have better things to do other than open up someone's blog and scrape off some of the trash that someone else just threw up, right?  Apparently not.  I don't know what this blog is gonna look like. Honestly, I might even use this blog to just  urlLink learn to talk non-stop without having anything intelligent to say . One of the weirdest things is the fact that my lab mate  urlLink Elijah  does blog research, writing papers like this  urlLink FOAF  thingy (What? FOAF doesn't seem related to blogs? Well I am not getting paid to write all this either : ) And I can only hope that this blog isn't one of the things that he uses in his research cuz doing Stemming, Stop Word Removal on this one will result in  null .  Ok, now that I've eliminated any chance of my blog being widely read by such a lame intro, (and actually managed to write so much without making sense, achieving one of my goals already), I think I'll just move on and find something more useful to do in life, like read Salman Rushdie.
