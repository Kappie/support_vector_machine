This past weekend was seriously one of the best experiences of my life ( the  best except for maybe JSA @ Stanford, and maybe even better).  Honestly, there's not one single thing I would change about it.  You know what the funny part is?  I didn't even win.  It was a strangely relieving feeling not to hear my division number and name called out at the truly incredible awards banquet/closing ceremony.  Sure, I was disappointed, but for some reason that didn't overpower the great sense of personal accomplishment I was feeling after having spent the weekend with five (well, more like four) inspiring individuals.  I ended up as one of the five other "runner-ups", and after a brief conversation with one of the board members, it appears I was #2.  That was somewhat comforting.  So it went down like this: I was the last to arrive in Beautiful Downtown Reno, Nevada (the self-proclaimed "Biggest Little City in the World" and in my opinion, the crappiest).  It's great when the first things you see upon stepping off the plane and into the airport is a sleu of slot machines and and an advertisement for a gentleman's club.  Gotta luv Nevada.  Then, we find my commanding officer, find a shuttle, and begin making our way towards my weekend hellhole, er...hotel...wait, no...motel.  Crackhouse?  Hmmm...rat house would probably be the best term.  Anyways, I ended up being late for our first function (thanks, Staff Sergeant P for giving the best dang directions on this side of the Miss-uh-sippi).  Coupled with learning that our oral board was not to be on Saturday as I thought but rather Friday evening, it was a rather stressful afternoon.  However, the landscape surrounding Reno was enough to quell my strong distaste for the Unfortunate Series of Events that was plaguing my afternoon.  There are beautiful snow-capped mountains on all sides of the city.  The view flying in was simply breathtaking, and it really made me consider moving Out West some day...and then I slapped myself and all was well.  The people with whom I competed were incredible.  One was from Cali. (SoCal, for those who are interested), another from Pennsylvania, another from North Carolina, yet another from somewhere up North and East (he had the strongest New England accent I've heard in a while), and another from Ohio.  It was great being from Texas.  As my fellow competitors so graciously pointed out, only two things come from Texas: steers and...well, you get the point.  To make a long story even longer, I had the opportunity to speak with a multitude of impressive people.  I walked in stride with generals, conversed over marketing with business leaders, and spoke before a board of six people who seemed to be quite impressed with my ability to open my mouth and issue forth words that came out in complete sentences...just not enough to give me first place.  Dang it, I'm supposed to be working on the bitter aspect.  I'm really not.  I even listened to a speaker talk about the difference between cows and rhinos; heck, I even became a certified rhino!  Keep charging!  No more "moos" from me, no siree!  The guy who won was the guy I predicted to win the contest a year ago before I even knew I would be competing.  He's sharp, smart (although he kept groveling over my 1370, which got kind of annoying), and reminded me of a certain newspaper staff member, which really helped ease some of the tension.  The experience was great, and I now have contacts from coast to coast.  For three days, I got to live out a dream: a true, bonafied, in-color dream that I will keep with me for the rest of my life.  Tomorrow I must wake up from said dream to take the dreaded AP English Language and Composition Exam.  Yeah, uhhmmm...methinks tomorrow should be fun.
