I wanted originally to go see  Fahrenheit 9/11 but was shot down when no one wanted to go with me. Danielle  said she couldn't and didn't give reason, all the guys where having a poker  tournament, and Michael was hanging out with friends, and Frank Mistretta wasn't  around. So I was stuck.       Later in the day, I watched  "Larry King Live" and Bill Clinton was on the show. I'm very impressed with Bill  and I'm really starting to like him. I still think he didn't know how to go to  war or even aid in international conflicts, kind of like in Somalia, where he  pussied out and brought the troops back. He even defended President George Bush  on a few affairs (no pun intended) such as the ongoing war and 9/11. I also very  much like the fact that he's very supportive on the war against AIDS. Finally,  we see a different side of Clinton.      Because of the dullness of the  day, I have nothing left to write, so adios.
