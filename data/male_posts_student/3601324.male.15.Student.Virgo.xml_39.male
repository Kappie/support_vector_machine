The kind you have to swallow WHOLE (I know that's most pills. Shut up.). It's like PURE EVIL poured into a tiny pill capsule. 'Cause, y'know, swallowing anything that big that  isn't  food pretty much sucks. When I took one, it kinda reminded me of that "How To Feed a Pill to a Cat" thing that Incu sent me a while ago. Hey, I'mma go try and find that. :D
