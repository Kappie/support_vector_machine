It was very enlightening, especially the speeches made by Redemtrist Brother Nelville who's going to be ordained next year and also by a guy named Christian. I don't know about the rest but I do know that I managed to learn quite an amount during this retreat. Sigh, wish it was longer. Anyway, I got to go now. See you all soon!
