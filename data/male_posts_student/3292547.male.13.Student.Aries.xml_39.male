I almost thought I wouldn't get a chance to post today, but I was proven wrong. We thought we might go to the movies, but it turn out to late after we had finished everything  and  gone to Lowe's.  Today we went to see  Beauty  the Beast  The Playhouse is the first theater in the world licensed by Disney to produce Beauty and the Beast independently. It is one of the most lavish productions in Playhouse history, and advance ticket sales are ahead of last year's hit Cats.   You can check out thier website at  urlLink www.ccplayhouse.com . We just got back like I said.  I finished reading  The Fires of Heaven  on the way back home. I haven't gotten a chance to start in on the 6th book ( Lord of Chaos ), but I intend to finish it after I finish this and write an e-mail to Cassie. Anyway, I won't take up and more of your time, if you won't take up anymore of mine. Talk to you later. Bye.
