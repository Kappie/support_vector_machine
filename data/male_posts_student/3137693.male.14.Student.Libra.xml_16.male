Today looks like another boring day, but i've somewhat talked my parents into letting me take an early vacation because of school and how much i "dislike" it right now. Farmington sweet farmington eh? Well on the last day of school im going to try and go over across the street from farmington and sign yearbooks since im not allowed on the school's premesis.  Things dont look like their really getting any better in my life, so taking an early vacation to get my mind off everything can't be too bad for the body. I'll update the blog while im in blanding as much as i possibly can, i wont be leaving for about a week so until then.   Shutt out.
