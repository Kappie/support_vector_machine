"...I've been here so long, I think that it's time to move, The winter's so cold, summers over too soon. So let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow.  I've got some friends, some that I hardly know, But we've had some times I wouldn't trade for the world....  ...If love is a labour, I'll slave 'till the end. I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand..."    indeed
