I get back and have a couple weeks at home, then leave again on the 14th and will be gone until the 26th. That's the short version, because it's unimportant and nobody cares. It'll definitely be interesting at Shasta. I mean, the youth group is already teeming with hormones: it's only going to get worse in a bathing suit environment with basically no schedule. And you know what that means. I get to study people in interesting situations again. I will certainly have paper and pen on hand at all times. I want to work more on my short story, which is in major need of help in the dialogue area. I'll be paying close attention to the way people talk while on this trip. Because odds are nobody will ever shut up. I also have much reading to do. I haven't picked up  War and Peace  for a while, although I like it a lot. I'm simply too caught up in  1984  and  The Count of Monte Cristo . I should easily be able to finish both of them if I can catch a few moments' peace while down there. Anyway, I'll cut this short before I get any more trivial or unimportant.
