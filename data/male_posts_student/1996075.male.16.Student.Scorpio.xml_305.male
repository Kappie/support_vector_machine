"i love ryan he is hott" ~mOoLaU~ every little step i take, you will be there, every little step i make, we'll be together, every little step i take, you will be there, every little step i make, we'll be together...i cant sleep at night, i toss and turn listenin' for the telephone, when I get your call im all choked up, cant believe you called my home, and as a matter of fact it blows my mind you would even talk to me, cause a boy like you is a dream come true
