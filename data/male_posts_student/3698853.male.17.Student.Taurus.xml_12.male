The furthest back I can remember, (don't laugh, now, but) there were two girls who looked remarkably like Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus (>_ they  knew what they were talking about). Then, for no apparent reason, the crimson thingies and the other martians took on human forms it was really weird, and they had families walking around and stuff and weren't all nasty and scary. Then, I think my alarm went off, so I woke up half-way and the dream got interrupted. _Then it's like a flashforward, or maybe just a complete shift in setting. So we're (I am now included in my dream) in some western setting around sunset/sunrise? There's a girl and some man (the antagonist) with me.  There's a sole tree in the middle of a field, and to the side is a wheat field. We mess around with some really poisonous spiders cuz' we're fighting the bad guy. Another blank spot. Then he grabs a spider, and I steal his gun. he chases me around with the spider, and the girl, I guess, is just sitting there by the tree. The spider shoots off his hand and starts biting at me, which was really weird. Naturally (sarcastic), I dove into the wheat fields to hide myself, but I had the gun (it was a big clunking pistol too). SO there was like a chase or something. Then villagers from a nearby (>_>)... village, approach, and start attacking anyone. I shot a couple of them (just injured), and just when they discovered me, the ground started rumbling. Apparently, there was a tidal wave coming from the side, and so we all had to work together to knock down the bridges in order to dam up the valley. Then I woke up. I wish I'd remembered more from my dream, cuz' that didn't make any sense I suppose from the outside. Lately, I've been trying different sleeping methods so that I could remember my dreams. Sounds weird, but before, during the schoolyear when I got hardly any sleep or was just too tired for words, I was unable to remember ANY of my dreams. My friend could recall all of her weird dreams, and I was jealous so I've been doing my best to remember them (XD). That's all.
