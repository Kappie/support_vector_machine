Maybe now he won't be so tired at school and he might just remember to finish his science fair project. Oh yeah and yesterday when the English teacher asked me what my oral was gonna be about, i panicked and blurted out ninjas, not realizing there is absolutely NO real information about ninja's available on the face of this planet. Excellent. I suppose I'll just construct my own guide to ninjas and codes and stuff and pray for a passing grade. Some friends have urged me to ninja roll into the class with a shirt over my head, as seen at midnight in my mom’s room a few months ago, but i think i have a bit more dignity than that, maybe. Hmm what else, I wonder wtf snake is doing. Oh yeah i forgot he's sleeping. Probably with his fucking Blues Clues Teddy or something. Oh yeah and today when i tried to search Dust Bunnies on google because my friend wanted a pic of them , I stumbled upon countless sites about how Lunette the clown is fat, and parents complaining about their kids shoved the toys under the couch cushions after watching the show in attempt to pose the 10 second tidy . I even read something about someone’s brother "abusing himself to the site of Lunette the clown" ... It's a sick world. There was also a complaint about the Dust Bunnies posted because they made the daughter upset and have trouble sleeping at night. HaHa. Uh yeah that's about it.  Hanson; 1 Snake; -3 Ninjas; 1 i guess Lunette the clown; 0
