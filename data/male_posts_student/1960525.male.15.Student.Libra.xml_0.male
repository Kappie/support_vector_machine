Michelle vs. Lindsey Michelle: pros. local, nice, pretty, might like me, fun, similar intrests; cons. dont know if she likes me, lives in a different town(closer than Lindsey, still to far to easily commute), pretty shy, known for a long time. Lindsey: pros. nice, hot, know she likes me, similar intrests, open, responds to emails; cons. has a boyfriend, lives in houston, really dont get to see her much... i think thats it  ok, so i need help, all of you, i need to know what to do, should i try somthing with Michelle(again/still) and risk our friendship, or should i hold out and try to be with Lindsey.  she wont even kiss me if i have a girlfriend, cause its bad enough to her boyfriend, and it would be so much worse if we both had someone else.  i am at a huge loss for ideas here and i dont know why this came to mind, but i want your advice.  post a comment on Bloggers new posting system, this will probably be up for a while so a lot of you can read it.  im sleeping now so i can do my exams tomorrow, ok then, night, bed bugs, stuff, bye
