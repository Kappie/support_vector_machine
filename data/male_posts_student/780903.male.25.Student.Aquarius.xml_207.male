It's pretty cool to eat with professors and get to talk to them outside of the classroom.  He talked a bunch about his year spent clerking for Justice Marshall on the Supreme Court and how he got to go to a barbecue at the Justice's house, where the Justice himself was flipping burgers on the grill.  He said the clerkship was really hard work and long hours.  But still, if you're gonna work long hours, are there that many jobs cooler than clerking for the Supreme Court?
