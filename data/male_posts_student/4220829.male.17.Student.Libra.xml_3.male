It started at 3:30am, so I woke up at 3:00. Ellie and Mum were already awake, and were bickering with each other. I muttered "goodmorning", got a half full corn chip packet from the cupboard and went into the lounge room, where the TV was already on.  Channel  7 had a replay of the Sydney opening ceremony on, I arrived just as the torch lit the cauldren. Mum and Ellie came in, and we settled down and watched the opening ceremony. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!! It was modern, respected Greeces fantastic hstory, and was really well done. The American team didn't get a good clap, nor did Israil, but Iraq, Cyprus, Palestine and Greece got heaps of applause. The DJ that was playing was really good too.   The ceremony finished at 6 in the morning, and so instead of going back to sleep, I had a shower and did some more designes for my super *******. Ellie and Mum left for the chiropractor and then for Annas house to stay there for the night-Ellies best friend from Gelong is selling her family house in Preston, and so she is there for 'support'. Mum left me $30 for dinner for me and possibly you guys. So, since 8:30 this morning, I have been home alone, I am not coping well :( .  At around 9:00, I went on MSN for the first time in like three years, this Thai guy from Wesley was on, as were you Natasha! I chatted to both you and the Thai guy, and found the Thai guy was at the beginning more responsive than you. That was because he thought I was a female English teacher from his student dorm on bell street, where PANCH used to be. When he found out that wasn't me, he lost intrest. I did ask him about the presidential election in Thailand, then closed his box thing. As for my conversation with you, well it didn't last long. Basically most things I put on the table got a yeah or haha, eventually I got to the crux of the matter, whether you would be working on Sunday morning. You said you didnít know, but thought it would be likely.   After this I washed my dogs, both of whom have been itching their backs heaps, Lattes back actually started bleedng. We had hoped it would stop if we washed them, but they sit next to me now on the couch itching themselves madly.  Anyway, at about 12:00, You (Natasha) rang me and told me that you wern't working on Sunday morning. FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT IS FINALLY GOING TO HAPPEN!!!!!!!!!!!  You said you had rang Emily, but she was at her grandmothers house, and would be getting back at 5:00.   So I spent the afternoon waiting for you to ring back. I was going to go to Altona to do some shopping, but thought I might miss your call, so I waited, and waited, and waited.  I watched a fantastic game from Athens of vollyball between Germany and Cuba, it was so close, in the end Germany won by a point. That match went for two and a half hours, it finished at 6:00. You (Natasha) had told me that you would ring me at 5:00, so I waited until 7:00 before ringing you. I didn't get through, but then you rang me straight back. You told me that you had gotten through to Emily, she had organised to go to Pablo's place until 9:30, and had wanted your mum to pick her up and drive you both to my place. Your Mum had said she didn't want to be driving around at that time of night, so again it was all called off.  I am here, stuck in the middle and on the point of tears (I am totally serious), i've waisted a whole fucking day waiting for you two, and you have both called the whole thing off, what the fuck am I supposed to do now? Fuck i'm pissed of right now.  John
