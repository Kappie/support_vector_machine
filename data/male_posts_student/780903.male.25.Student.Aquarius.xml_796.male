Can you remove a stone wall on your land that just happens to be keeping the mountainside from collapsing and your neighbor's house from falling into the ocean?

Leases, covenants, and an arcane rule about not being able to leave property to people who may not come into existence until more than 21 years after you die (there's no way I'm getting that right) are just some of the fascinating things you'll cover in Property!
