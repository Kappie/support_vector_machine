Due to the fact i have nothing better to do, i guess i'll just carry on typing stuff up. u see there is not point at all and i repeat NO POINT at all in reading any of this. i guess some time in the next couple of years i'll read this stuff and realise what a loser i used to be. I suppose in a way i'll be able to keep a sort of mind log of what occurs throughout my triesome days of work and school and attempt to try and recall all the nights that i spend drinking JD until either i suddenly find the bottle empty or realise that the bottles been snatched away from me because all my friends think i could die any second. sounds absurd doesn't it? i for one do think so.   Just bought a ticket for the velvet Revolver gig in september. i kinda freaked out as my computer crashed just asi was about to press the BUY button. its absolutely outrageous how misleading the prices for these damn tickets r. its like: velvet revolver, hammersmith apollo, 17.50. So u think to yourself: hey, thats pretty reasonable and u click on the link and tap in your details. they show u a subtotal, and thats where u realise that they;re gonna charge u a shitload more. in the end, if u include the service charge and the handling fee or something else or other, it came to 25.50. its not very expensive, but it is 8 pounds off the original value of the ticket. s'ppose those of you who r bored enough to be even looking at this page don;t live in london where everything is outrageously priced.  There goes the TV on the other side with my little bro watching the simpsons at full volume. mum's calling. must be dinner time. chances r i'll come back later. sad eh?
