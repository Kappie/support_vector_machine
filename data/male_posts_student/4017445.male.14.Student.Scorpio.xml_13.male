If I ever download a ppc linux distribution, I might be able to salvage the applications on the disks, so all is not lost.  In other news, today I started working on the new interface for my new domain.  I'm not going to make any promises about when it will be uploaded.  You can't rush these things, but when it's up, It'll be GREAT!!!
