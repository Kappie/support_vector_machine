As you both know, I plan to go overseas at the end of the year, and thought this would be a good way to keep up with you, at least from where I am.  Anyway, today was a fairly busy day! I have a sprained wrist (which is healing really fast!), and have had a few days off school, so I was worried about what work I had missed out on while I was away. I caught the train to Melbourne Central station this morning, then walked to Swanston Street and caught the Moreland tram. I walk to the doors and in the window of the tram I see Tim! I greet him, and we start talking. I tell him about my bike accident, and he tells me that Mr Collins-my biology teacher- has broken his leg, and was hobbling around school yesterday. We chatter some more, and arrive at Melbourne Uni. A man gets on the back doors of the tram. He is wearing a large black trenchcoat and has really long black mangly hair. Tim and I continue to talk, and he sits behind where Tim is sitting. We arrive at the stop near the cemetary, and the man turns around and says "Sorry guys, I couldn't help overhearing you, it looks really bad mate '[gesturing at my arm in a sling] (Tim and I were talking about something totally differant). I nod and shake his hand. He asks us where we are from, and I say we are from Melbourne, and are going to school. "Oh yeah, I'm from Perth. It is lovely here in Melbourne, but it sure as fuck is cold. I have caught so many colds and viruses over here, they have been like, yeah, shit [snorts his nose], fuck they are bad". Tim and I nod, and I discreetly wipe my hand as best I can. We see our stop rapidly approching and so we stand, shake his hand one last time then get off the tram.   We continue to talk, then arrive at school. Tim, who has his lockers with the year 10's, departs on the second level and I walk to the third level. Then I see you Natasha, and we talk briefly. I get my books and walk down the corridor with you and discuss Saturday night with you, you say you can't come because you are working, and I am really pissed off, and i mean really. I go to the biology room and you go to lit. I meet up with Rose and vanessa at the end of the corridor, and I banter with Rose about bio, then she tells me " I had the strangest dream last night, all the people from the central Australia trip were on a new trip organised by Mr Bull, we were going to Spain, but got lost, so we had to sleep on a coal train". She gigles and I nod my head. I tell her that Peter won't probably come because I have a mediation session with him. "Yeah, you know he really hates you, he says stuff like.............god I hate that fucker and his mediation". Ha, well !@#$$%$#@#$%%@ !#. I don't tell her that, but it has been going through my mind ever since. Anyway, who should turn the corner but the man himself, Peter, who yells to all of us, "he isnt here guys", and then motions erotically to his crotch, as if guiding a plane to land. Tim and I decide to go for a walk with Leo............................Hold up a sec, this is getting boring, lets change the pace a bit.  I don't really know what I am going to use this for, I suppose just to note down how I feel at the moment. Well, i'm in the dumps. Firstly, I had my last mediation session today with Peter, it really wasn't pleasant. basically Peter came out the victor, he has no punishment for his actions, and I am told that I have to stop insulting him. Thanks a bunch.   Anyway, Ellie is being a pain in the arse at the moment, she is going through puberty at the moment and is really cranky with me heaps. Mum is as always really stressed and tired, I really worry for her, but what can I do about it? Tell her to stop work?  Anyway guys, i'm really stressed today. I wish we had met up on Saturday, I really needed to catch up with you both...........  John
