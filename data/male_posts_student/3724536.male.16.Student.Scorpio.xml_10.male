Well i suppose i better make a few things clear. firstly, i do not intend to make this blog a daily affair and have never thought of it that way. This blog was made to highlight only the meaningful/wonderful/sad/surprising/agonizing/once-in-a-lifetime things that happen in my life. of course such things do not happen everyday so therefore please do not expect updates that often. I most certainly do not intend to make this blog a daily diary where i crap about what ive been doing everyday. if u really want me to do that, then tell me and i might make another blog just for that. =P  Last Sunday i went with my parents to see a musical entitled  Do You Hear The People Sing?  it wasnt actually really a musical, more like a medley featuring songs from a variety of broadway musicals. I went there for a particular song from the broadway musical  Joseph and His Technicolour Dreamcoat  which i used to love when i was a kid. Even though i knew what to expect when i went there, it really surprised me that i had forgotten so many of the songs i used to watch and listen to back in London. watching this show certainly brought back long forgotten memories which thx God were not totally erased from my mind. It really pains me to realize that i have not remembered much about the first seven years of my life spent living in England, whether it be about school, my old house or watching musicals like these. Of course i still remember little bits and pieces of what life was like over there but not to the extent that some people expect me to. After watching the show, i not only refreshed my memory about joseph and his dreamcoat but also other forgotten musicals like  Phantom Of The Opera, Grease  and others. When i got back home i went straight to kazaa and started searching for all the songs, not to mention the lyrics as well. ahh what wonderful memories it all brings back now....  Of course watching the show wasnt the only memorable thing that happened that night. Before the show me and my dad went to the burger king near the masjid jamek lrt station to have a bite since we didnt have enough time to eat dinner. When we were walking back, we saw this Kembara stopped by the side of the road with 2 parents frantically running around trying to clean up something. later we realized their baby had done a poo-poo in the back of the car and they were really looking like they had a big job on their hands. It was quite amusing watching the dad holding a box of tissues while the mum was wiping some sort of substance off the baby(and maybe the car seat...) As if that wasnt enough, just a few meters down the road we were passing by this taxi which had stopped behind a row of cars waiting for the traffic light to turn green. Suddenly the backdoor flew open and the passenger inside started vomiting right onto the road. I hate to imagine what it would have been like if the taxi had been moving and the guy at the back couldnt hold it in any longer... EwWwWww...  The taxi driver sitting in front certainly wasnt looking happy though. i suppose no one would be happy if your passenger suddenly has to unload all his food from his stomach just when hes riding in your cab. but still the driver should be happy he didnt throw up all over his car seat. THAT would have been a major problem. i really hope the driver didnt kick him out of the cab. knowing malay drivers, thats probably what they would do to an indian behaving like that(no offense). So in the space of 20 meters i saw shit come out from both ends of a human being - front and back. Boy tht must have been my lucky day. =D  To end this post, im gonna post the lyrics  from the musical Joseph and His Technicolour Dreamcoat.   Any Dream Will Do - Jason Donovan  I closed my eyes Drew back the curtain To see for certain What I thought I knew Far far away Someone was weeping But the world was sleeping Any dream will do  I wore my coat With golden lining Bright colours shining Wonderful and new And in the east The dawn was breaking The world was waking Any dream will do  A crash of drums, a flash of light My golden cloak flew out of sight The colours faded into darkness I was left alone  May I return To the beginning The light is dimming And the dream is too The world and I We are still waiting Still hesitating Any dream will do......
