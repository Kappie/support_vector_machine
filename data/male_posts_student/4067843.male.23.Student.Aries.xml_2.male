It was maybe the most annoying travel day I had ever experienced on Friday, what should had been a relatively simple trip from Washington, DC to Huntsville turned into a fiasco in the long term parking lot at BWI Airport.....If you have never been, the long term parking is located quite a bit away from the terminal so you have buses come and pick you up and transport you to the terminal......they advertise the shuttle bus comes every ten minutes, but what they don't tell you is that is stops at like 35 stops along the way, so we stood in the sun for waiting for an old, half broken down bus to pick us up....everything was fine and great until we get to the next stop and the doors won't open.....completely jammed.....something is wrong with this picture that a bus doors have no safety mechanism in place to make sure this doesn't occur...what if the bus would had been on fire....we would have all died....but gratefully we didn’t....we did get the opportunity to jump out of the emergency exit windows with all of our luggage....a bus full of people with giant suitcases jumping six feet out of a bus window.....gratefully we made it to our gate on time and made our flight......   We first flew to Cincinnati and then caught our connecting flight to Huntsville, where I had the opportunity to sit next to a truly unique man......at first sight he looked like a normal, rather fat man catching a flight home to be with his wife, in which you would assumed he loved very much.....this assumption was even more evident by his calls before our flight to call his wife and express his love and then his repeated text messages to her before we took off....wow finally someone who appreciates and respects the sanctity of marriage.....(unlike most repubs...)....well finally we take off and not five minutes into our flight this asshole is hitting on our flight attendant....and the best part she is buying it....now this fuckhead is up at the front of the plane with our flight attendant.....is this fucker really going to try to pick up a flight attendant not more than 10 minutes after his multitude of expressions of love for his wife....so he's back in his seat and is writing the flight attendant a note....oh wait a note on the back of his business card....he really grappled with this action...evident by his repeated attempts to wuss out and not cheat on his wife....but in the end he finds himself getting up to the flight attendant his expression of lust....so we are cleared for landing and we touch down in Huntsville and the first thing this fucker does is gets out his phone to call his wife....and once again express his undying love for her.....moral of the story.....this fat fuck cheating on his wife in the 30 minutes in between phone calls expressing his undying love for her.....and secondly,.....and most importantly he was a Bush supporter and Republican....haha.....well I don't know that but its the best we can assume.....                                                                                                   While I sit in AL, single, some fat fuck can't be happy that he found love with his wife; he gets greedy and wants to fuck the flight attendant.....
