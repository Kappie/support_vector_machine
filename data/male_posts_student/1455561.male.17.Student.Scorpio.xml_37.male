Ahahahaha.  when i looked at this american sports web page that seemed to link to me,  it turned out there is some american sports player called mmcevoy and they thought that he had clearly had a monumental breakdown and was now convinced he was a 17 year old living in hobbit country.  If you are reading this thinking that i am in fact a sports star, then of course, i AM him.  I remember winning all those really important things in the sport i play/played.  All this crap about maths, crocodiles and windowsills is just a clever ruse to persuade rival sportsmen not to read it.  well done on recognising that i really am him.  Therefore you are all invited to my house, wherever that may be.  Why dont you look on the internet to find where i play, chances are i will live nearby and then ask the locals for directions: just tell them that you are mr mcevoys very close internet friend and you would like to touch his beard.  If you get to MY house, dont be stopped just because i dont answer the door, check round the back, or climb through a window to meet me: its not breaking and entering if i invited you and i am inviting you.  When the police ask you what you were doing just tell them that a particularly charming goblin told you to.  Always blame those dirty goblins.  If you came here looking for alan titchmarshes spring gardening tips you are also in the wrong place.  Fi you want to know mr titchmarsh's top tips, i suggest you also take the above action.  Of course you may just be here for fun, but thats just ridiculous cos only 2 people have done that in the past 3 weeks you lazy weasle eating cranberries.
