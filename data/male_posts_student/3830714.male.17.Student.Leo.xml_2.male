Overall, the event was still okay la, except it's quite tiring, tiring to see so many people!    urlLink    My post master team....    urlLink    CCA branch sports hall... Students of primary 4 and sec 2 from different schools..    urlLink    Playing game: Yummy paradise   AFter the event, i went out with yuk. We went to Little Indian, bugis, and suntec. Here are some of the pics:    urlLink    Me and yuk at suntec...    urlLink    Me... Yes me...   After one whole day of fun, i sent yuk home. But guess what? When i reach Yio Chu Kang, it's already 11 30!!! I missed the last bus! Want to know what's the worst? I dun have money for cab, neither do yuk. So i ended going to her house. Her mum, to my surprise, offered to allow me to stay over. Hey! DOn't anyhow thing hor! We slept at diff room la!    This morning, i was supposed to have PW meeting at 10. I end up reaching there at 12! I kanna screwed by them, tomorrow still have to treat them lunch.    urlLink    Clockwise: Me, kelly, liang wei, ko zaw..
