When things are good everything is bomb but you know when something is not right everything in your life falls right down i line with it. you know i think that part of my sucky life is my fault because im making a big deal over nothin. you know. the problem. i call my girlfriend. she is doing schoolwork she tells me to call her back no one anwsers or shes doin her hair. her dad says she will call me. guess what nothin. she is workin on a painting she says call me in 30 minutes. guess what i try to call but the line is busy and isaiah wasnt online. another time its 1100 here im sick wait up to call her when she gets home from church. hey kita u busy? no. thats kool but im tired, me: ok you want me to let you go? No thats ok i have to go in a while anyways. 2 minutes lateryo know i have to be off the phone at 100. its 955 now. 1 minute later you know i have to go my mom told me to get off of the phone. her i love you. me: thinking) yeah right whatever you just try so hard to get off of the phone then you actually have the audacity to say i love you? whatever but yeah still i say i love you too because in every way i think i try to express my love for her. i guess its not good enough for her. so yeah thats my crappy life.
