I still love that small building! I had a few more lessons this time thabn yesterday, and it really hit me. This is back at school time, i might actually have 2 try this year... anyways, back to th more interesting stuff. It looks like we ARE going camping on the weekend, seeing as me and joe went into town to get supplies. Which ment that we were going in for the disposable BBQ's and firelighters. We also bought lighter fluid, matches and i bought a lighter (which is cool, and im playing with it now! :D) Lol me and Joe are in charge of the fire making (and puting out eventually) and its gonna be too fun!!!! we ended the night with a small drinking session at mine. sitting in the garde, reminising about good times had, when i havent even known Joe for a year yet... s'weird, feels like ive known him all my life.  Anyways, aside from nostalgia, ive had a weird thing happen. Emma has started speaking to me again, who knows what this means but i dunno. Could be goood but in my experience, talking to exe's only leads to awkward conversations and arguments. I dont need her anymore. Ive moved on. and aparantly so has she, im not sure if she was trying to make me jelous, but she was going on about how she dot drunk and laid every night on holiday.   I just turned it around an implied that she was some sort of slag....   aint i a stinker?  lol thats enough for now. see ya kext time keep it safe Veg
