He was making like 5 of them so I asked if he would let me have some of his weiner. All of a sudden the entire class was bursting out in laughter. Of course I was the only one who wasn't because I was confused. I didn't even know why they were laughing until someone explained it to me. It's supposed to mean that I want to give him head or something. I tell you, it's a pretty sad day when a man can't go up to another man eating a hot dog and ask for some of his weiner. When did this happen? When did all of these teenagers go completely sick-minded? I don't know. I do know that it has to stop. We shouldn't have to have to watch what we say al the time. Unless of course it's like a racial comment or someone will get their feelings hurt. Also, a few days ago I was watching one of my favorite movies........CRUEL INTENTIONS!!! People were calling me a sicko because there is a lot of sexual content. Yet, the reason I love it is because in the long run, It's a gripping movie that shows how cruel kids can be. So what the hell? If we didn't have sick-minded people i we would be able to watch these movies without being judged.
