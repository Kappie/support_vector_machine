I probably won't be calling home as I have very little free time; hell, I probably don't even have time to write this. If there's something of dire importance email me: I'm usually on MSN so I can communicate with my other house members and check my mail everytime I log on.    I miss everybody back home lots. Friday seems so far away and so close all at once.    Cheers from si'ty fi'ty fi',  - Cary
