Although our matriculation programme is quite pact with all those university required course such as English, Arabic, FKM (Fundamental Knowledge for Muslims) and Computer we do have many interesting activities going on. Much to the envy of our friends in KPM Matriculation Centre.   By the way, we also had Forum Bicara ad-Deen last Wednesday at al-Malik Faisal Hall, Matriculation Centre in collabration with IKIM.fm - the topic is "Generasi Muda Islam Menggalas Harapan". The panelist are Ustaz Wan Sohor, our very own Arabic lecturer and Ustaz Mohd Zamri, an IIUM graduate. We also had performance by De'Hearty.  Well, that's it for today. Will blog again later.
