Unsuspecting people are always being used by these people.   Some people will do about anything to get what they want and not even concider what they're doing to the people around them. They take advantage of other people's kindness and generocity, and if I say something about it, they just come back, "They wanted to do it! I'm getting it for free, I'm not spending money so it doesn't matter. You'd do it too!" The thing is if you really know me, I wouldn't. It's so selfish. I'm not saying that I'm the perfect person, I'm far from that, but at least I take other people's well being into concideration.  Another thing is most of the time, I don't think these people even know what they're doing when they do it. They're too stuck into themselves to even think about other people.  Just my little rant of the moment.   Brought to you by "Empathy," don't you wish everyone had it?
