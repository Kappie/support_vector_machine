I even called one of my friends to let her hear my favorite song, and she isnt even a fan of APC. The concert was at a fairly small stadium ( the San Jose State University Basketball Stadium) so that means there was less people to annoy me. A problem I had was that there were people in the pit acting like assholes, I was in the pit myself and had to constantly listen to people bitch at Maynard because he wasn't showing his face. Come on people, you know that he never shows his face, what makes you think he'll do it this time? Another thing is that while moshing, I jacked up my shoulder really good, but thanks to modern medication I dont really feel it that much. I bought a t-shirt, and it cost me 35 dollars. How uncool. I mean the price, not the shirt. Sorry, I'm still kinda hopped up on pain meds.  Umm been doing nothing but sleeping, swimming, and hanging with my friends. Oh yeah, and doing some O skeet skeeing(dont ask)
