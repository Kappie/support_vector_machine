Okay so I go visit my dad today....he looks so much better and is alot more active....he is a little more emotional but to me that is a good sign because it tells me he is getting his wits about him....  In other news I checked out Monster's Ball....  Interesting flick....I'll do it actor by actor  Halle-Well I have already discussed my issues about her apparent lack of self-esteem/regard but she turned in a decent performance....her southern accent (as always) was a tough sell on a Gawhgah boy like me but I mean I have "lowered expectations from her and well....she exceeded them....  Billy Bob-Well I am not a big fan of his work so I have very little besides Primary Colors to use as a gauge....it was a solid performance....but allow me to digress and state that, by way of the fact that he is married to Angelina Jolie (one of the truly beautiful women in Hollywood (regardless of what box she checks for race) and that he was for all intents and purposes going "The Full Monty" with Halle, he is the MAN OF THE YEAR!  Sean Puffy Combs-Understand that I have a very love-hate relationship with this man's body of work....hellafied R producer.....horrible rapper....nice dancer....horrible rapper....nice clothing line (I'm wearing a t-shirt and jeans of his as I type this)....did I mention he is a GAH-BAGE rapper....and there is also the annoying fact that 25% of people I know say we look alike....but he put in the best performance....  I'm not here to spoil the movie.....so check it out yourself.....but I will say that out of all the phlegm that is out there you will feel somewhat satisfied with this movie....
