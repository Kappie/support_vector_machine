Which was alright.  I didn't see anyone but Alex B, which was awesome, because we talked about strategy and conspiracys and crazy time cycles and fighting galactic wars, and memes.  And Atlantis.  It all comes back to Atlantis.  You know, people that don't like him  probably don't because they aren't smart enough to grasp the concepts (or understand, or fit into their own mnds) he speaks of.  When you get him and I together, we can relate our ideas on so many things, its very intellectual.  Well, I'm gona play a little D2 and then go to work.
