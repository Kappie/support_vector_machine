There are 2 Versions, the Famous Beatles Version, and the Johnny Cash one, both are very powerful in, and lol, i can't belive this, i'm about to cry...The song is "In My life"    There are places I'll remember All my life though some have changed Some forever not for better Some have gone and some remain All these places have their moments With lovers and friends I still can recall Some are dead and some are living In my life I've loved them all  But of all these friends and lovers There is no one compares with you And these memories lose their meaning When I think of love as something new Though I know I'll never lose affection For people and things that went before I know I'll often stop and think about them In my life I love you more  Though I know I'll never lose affection For people and things that went before I know I'll often stop and think about them In my life I love you more In my life I love you more   Some other songs to remind you of Freinds:  Eve 6 - here's to the Night, Vitamin C - Graduation (freinds Forever), Greenday - Good Riddance, The Cure - Pictures Of you,   Alphaville - Forever Young (
