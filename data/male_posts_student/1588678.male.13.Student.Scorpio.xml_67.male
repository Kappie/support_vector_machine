You could literally see the sweat dripping down Jimmy Page's face as he blows away the crowd with thundering-solos! Anyways, when they play the song "Whole Lotta Love" they had a 4 minute shot of Plant’s crotch! This was annoying; while I’m trying to enjoy Zeppelin I’m forced to see a lot of Plant-crotch.   Zeppelin lives on!
