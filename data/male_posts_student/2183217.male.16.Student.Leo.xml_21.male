This makes them toasty warm for just about the length of time it takes me to get to the metro near my house. It uses electricity but I can't help myself. The thing is, while everyone is walking around freezing, I have my own little atmosphere inside my sweater making me perfectly comfortable and warm. Everyone is stupid but me.
