This year is going so quick; soon we'll be able to say that all of [SMUT] is liberated from the dungeons of NRHS!  Alright. So what's new...  Last night, the doors in my car became permanently locked for some reason, so now I have to climb through the window to get in and out of my car. Fuckin' power locks -- good for nothing! Now if the windows stop working while I'm in the car, I'll be stuck in there. So if you don't hear from me for a week or two, you know what happened.  Friday night: ICE STORM!!! The best part of the night was seeing drunk people busting their asses on the quad, which was ultimately transformed into an ice skating rink. Fortunately, I didn't get drunk enough to fall on the ice and shake the earth.  I'll be seeing you guys soon. Until then, take care!  -BIGsmut.  P.S.  Don't get me started on toilet cloggings.
