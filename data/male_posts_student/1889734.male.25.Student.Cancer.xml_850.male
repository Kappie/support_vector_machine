Reagan is the greatest President of the 20th century because he showed us the truth of what we could be. He was our messiah in a time of great danger. A Moses who parted the Red Sea of Communism and lead the world to the prmised land. Do not scoff or roll your eyes. If you were in front of me I would slap you.   Communism was Reagan's great focus. I agree with him that collectivism is the greatest threat to humanity that has ever existed. Reagan led the world in the fight against it. People decry the spending and tax cuts that Reagan forced througha begrudging Democrat Congress. They say victory against Communism was a forgone conclusion. They say Reagan ruined the economy. They reduce Reagan to a clever actor in over his head. They are liars.   The President is the most important man in the world. He sets the tone for all of humanity. Nixon, Ford, Carter: these were weak men with small and timid ideas. Reagan had big ideas and the will to make them happen. Cutting taxes on the wealthy led to the greatest prosperity the world has ever seen. Building up our armed forces to undefeatable heights forced the Soviets to implode. Reagan's love of America, of freedom, and of the human spirit changed the face of the earth. Imagine the world if Reagan lost to Carter? You can't, and thats a good thing.  Reagan gave us hope in a time of hopelessness. He solved our problems by reducing them to insignifigance. Our spirits were lifted above them. We destroyed Communism in Europe and continue to do so In China because we refuse to stop being who we should be. We are now no longer afraid of petty tyrants and despots. There is no sense of hopelessness and defeatism in America today. At least not in the "real" America of the  urlLink Red  states.  My first recollection of Reagan was after the Challenger disaster. I remember being heartbroken, even at the tender age of 8. I don't remember what he said, but I do remember seeing Reagan on TV comforting the nation. I remember a few other of his speeches and conferences. Of course I was too young to appreciate it but I use Reagan as my reference for Presidents. I can tell you no man since has been his equal. George W. Bush is the inheritor of Reagan's spirit, but he cannot equal his progenitor.  I love Reagan and I believe the rest of America loves him because he was the best of us. What other President can be seen as so American? Honest, compassionate, dilligent, eloquent, steadfast, brave, and proud. He saw us as the beacon of freedom, the greatest hope of humanity. his legacy will carry on with us for the rest of our lives. How many other men can lay claim to such greatness? I consider myself fortunate to be able to look back and appreciate what those who came before have left for me. We should all seek to leave the world better than when we found it, as Ronald Reagan did.
