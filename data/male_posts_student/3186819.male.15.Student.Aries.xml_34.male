Well, that once again (and for the last time) has happened. Of course, at the time of publishing I only know one side of the story, and do not know if this is the actual case (because I don't believe a single bloody word Michael says), so please bare with me.  If you have (and I am not going to publish the dirty integral story here and now until I have heard all parts and considered their validity), than remember one thing. People can be idiots. I have some tips for you that I have learned from being in these situations and being "used" and "tested".  Tips: 1. Always listen to your family. They usually know best. When they say someone is not good for you, understand they truly mean that.  2. Trust your instincts. When you hear that little voice saying "You shouldn't", listen. The voice knows.  3. If someone has hurt you once, they are, in all likelyhood, going to again!  4. Be wary of who you trust. Unless someone has proved themselves trustworthy, they aren't.  5. Unless your family has done something to prove your trust wrong, give them the benefit of the doubt.  6. If someone has hurt you, you don't need them. You can find better friends.  7. Hear all sides to a story before passing judgement.  8. If you are ever fed a line such as "We were testing you", you do not need them. However you can use this "test" to learn something.  9. Don't be bitter at the world. Some people can just be jerks!   10. The world is not picking on you.  Okay, so there are the lessons I have learned. One of the most important is to not let it get to you. It may hurt, but don't bother with it. It is irrelevent! Find the good part of the situation and let that shine. Remember, you are valid, you are a good person, and you are not hated.  And in my defense for this situation (as from what I know) I was manipulated into saying some things. A friend whom I trusted much much more than the other manipulated me into feeding lines to the other. Now this part is party to change, as I have not heard the other side of the story yet. I trusted T much more than M. T got me to say things to M. I don't trust M...You fill in the blanks.
