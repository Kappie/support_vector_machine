Those 50 year-old guys rock out way better than of the young lames these days. Blink 182? SHIT compared to this performance which was the empitomy of perfection. Neil Peart had a crazy ass drum solo complete with cow bells and a spinning circular drum set. That man is severely talented. Can anyone YOU know keep the beat to xanadu chuck your drumstick 20 ft in the air, still keep the beat with both your feet on pedals and one free hand, catch the drumstick and keep going. NO. Alex and Geddy were crazy. Lifeson was just railing on his guitar during the encore performance: Limelight. It was crazy. Of course, geddy was rocking throughout the concert hopping from bass to keyboards/synthesizers while keeping the vocals going. O yea, nothings better than seeing white-boy 50 yr old man Geddy walk over to neil and jump with his 3 foot vertical on the big notes. hahaha. Anyway, in conclusion, the concert fucking kicked ass. Mike, John, Kaj and I are all going to the Frampton/Styx concert soo all yall better be going if its gonna be anywhere as good as the Rush concert. I guarantee if it is, it will be a life-altering experience.
