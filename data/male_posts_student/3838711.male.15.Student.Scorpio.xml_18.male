Everything was kinda normal in class, nothing went too bad, until Sherman told me Joei said i was "very cute", after that day when we went to see Spiderman 2. i was like har ? (-.o") got ger fancy me ? or my looks ? wow... wad a surprise.  Before that the medicine i took had its drowsy effects on me.. i kinda laid my head in class the whole day... but hearing that, i kinda had a sudden burst of energy and vitality, dunno why.. haha.  Anyway, had a conference for 1 and a half hrs in the afternoon around 4.30pm with Karie and Sherman... i was, haha, the listener most of the time... was kinda fun tho.. hee..  Messaged Joei at around 9.30pm, she didnt reply.... ahhh~~ i was expecting her to ! den just now sent another one... still no reply, so i tot i'll just leave it up to her ba, to reply or not.. but i sure hope she does ! lol.. feel kinda funny now.. excited, yet disappointed. well, i guess its up to Friday whether i'll see her or not... den can talk more to her i suppose.. if she doesnt dao me, that is..
