It's a great name, with many cool nicknames - Star, Starry, Fish, Fishy, Starfy, Arfish.  She will probably not sport a cornfrohawk, but you just never know. Which brings me to other news: I am getting a haircut today.  I am going to pay some person money to cut off my hair.  Barbering is one of the few industries where we pay people to take things away.  Also banking, but the difference is that there is an understanding that the bank will give you your money back someday, whereas the barbershop would never in a million years return your hair. Another such business is daycare, but this is also temporary, and usually much shorter term than the bank.  So, in conclusion - You pay daycare to take your kids for a day, The bank to take your money for some years, and the barbershop to take your hair FOREVER.  Luckily hair grows back, and is an infinitely renewable resource, unless you are Homer Simpson or Captian Picard. Has everybody heard of the Wikipedia?  The ultimate experiment in anarchy - anyone can update a page with new info.  You could. I could.  Gary Coleman could.  Gary Coleman is, by the way, in a new musical called Avenue Q which just won a lot of Tonys.  It's about homosexuality and rascism and muppets, and Gary Coleman is played by a woman.   Anyway, if I ever had a topic to get off it I lost it a long time ago.    Is that a rocket you've got hidden there?  No, it's my cookie.
