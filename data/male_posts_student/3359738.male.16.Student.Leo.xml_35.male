Who needs a zillion bots when you have 200Mbps DSL? That's what the future seems like. Anyway, for us good (non-packet-kiddie) people, it will be very nice to have such speedy connections.    And coming soon, intercontinental travel at the speed of light! So fast you'll have to lose your baggage beforehand.
