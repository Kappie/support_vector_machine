But now, here  I sit at quarter to 4 (THATS AM, FOLKS, 4:45AM) still awake with this baby. I got a particularily easy one from what I have obersved. The last time it cried was at 2:08AM....So it'll start soon. This truly is a matter of Baby. THINK IT OVER. I think legally any teenager wishing to have a child and is in the next short while going to attempt to conceive, are in the process of concieving, or thinking, "Awe, a baby will be nice" should have to take this baby home for a week. There is no sleep involved, you have to worry about every little thing (is its head supported? is it on its back? what does it need now?!). This is truly a case of thinking over the decision of having a baby. Not just thinking it over, living the reality! The greatest feeling I will of had this year (well, it is at par with the realization of never having to take gym again) will be when Mrs. Warren cuts this key off my wrist!!!!! Although (note 3:52AM, baby cried [thats like right now, it cried whilst writing my blog]) a fun and educational exercise, its tough. I gave up on trying to sleep! So my words of advise before getting pregnant? BABY. THINK IT OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!1
