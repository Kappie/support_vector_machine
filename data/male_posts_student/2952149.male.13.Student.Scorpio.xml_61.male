Well you know how both Reagan and Ray Charles died  recently? Well there has been all of this stuff about Reagan on T.V. and everything but nobody cares about Ray and you know why? It's because he is black lol....but I am serious. The only T.V. stations that probably care about him are BET and VH1....VH1 cause last night they mentioned it but all it was was a lil thing goin across the bottom of the screen for two seconds....but maybe im wrong, maybe we do live in a racially equal society....no....nevermind.
