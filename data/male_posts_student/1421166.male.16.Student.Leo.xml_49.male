Oh well, but I'm still thankful for the break. I hadn't had my diarhoea rounds today, so I hope that this time, it's really recovering. And band practice was ok. I'm glad cause we weren't scolded by the conductor, and it was a bit more enjoyable. And yeah!!! I'll be playing Eflat Clarinet all the way for Speech Day! So cool. Just hope the teacher-in-charge doesn't criticise the band again. Tomorrow's the first Outdoor BS I'll be attending. So exciting. Anyway, for me, spiritual life is picking up, emotional life is up, physical life is better(I just recovered from illness), and school life, for the mean time is still easy to cope. Really thank God. I kinda realised how people(or at least me) always only feel as though they are learning from God, or feel that God is graceful and can safe them when in trouble. However, when life is peaceful, I sometimes feel that life is boring, God is not so active anymore, we start to put away God's goodness after a while, and take everything for granted, then, we get into trouble and start the whole cycle again. It shows how each of us choose to acknowledge God and His goodness at different times. But actually, we should always give thanks to God whatever the circumstances. And to remember that He is good, and He is there. I'm working on it. Anyway, my entire life is basically about God's goodness, it's just whether I notice it. God is so good, always good.
