Yesterday me and shane hung out, we didnt have anything to do so we went to exclusive company and found these awesome stickers that say "god doesnt care" thats it, theres nothing else on them, there red stickers with white letters and that simple phrase. there cool. So after we left exclusive we went to sinners and saints (the tattoo place) and we were there for 2 hours. we just hung out with the guys that work there, there all really really awesome people. it would be cool to work there. So i got really bored while i was there so i began drawing, i drew a skull with wings coming out the side and its flying over a headstone and grave. Well shane thought it was cool and so did they guy that draws the tattoos so he said he would "polish" it up and shane put a down payment on it. so that means shane is getting my drawing tattooed on the back of his arm. thats awesome.  man, im in a really bland mood today, im not mad or happy or sad or tired, just bored. so i dont really have anything to write about.  I got the new AP, taking back sunday is on the cover and there is a really good article about them inside. so i suggest if you like TBS then you should go read it.  I signed up for the Alkaline Trio Blood Pact yesterday. its a fan club. and when you send away to join you get a t-shirt, a poster, a bag, a membership card, a button, pin, sticker, patch. it cost $34.20 to join.  AHHHHH MY HEAD IS EMPTY AND I HAVE NOTHING TO BLOG ABOUT!
