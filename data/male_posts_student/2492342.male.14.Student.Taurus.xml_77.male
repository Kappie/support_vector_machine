An hour and a half she talked and I half listened while thinking of how I wanted to do it. Upon all the cues that called for input I would throw short sentences at her, or questions that I knew would require a detailed answer on her part so that I would not have to speak again soon. From about 1 pm until 4 pm I spent my time at school planning.     I am going to wear my black dress. The one everyone tells me I look like a doll in. The black dress that once made me look awfully thin and graceful. The one with the pink at the bottom is the one I will wear.  I will put hot water in the bathtub. I will sit down in the tub. I will press the razor blade deep into my flesh, deeper than I have ever cut. I will draw that blade up my arm. Then, I will do the same to my other wrist. I will lay down in the hot water of my bathtub, in my gorgeous black, designer dress and wait until I am gone.     That was to take place after school. My mother would be watching TV in the living room and typing away at her computer. My father would be working. My brother would be studying or getting drunk. I would be dying in the bathtub all dressed up  I got to my front door. My mind was numb along with my fingertips. I got inside. My mom was there and she asked, Ready to go to therapy? I had completely forgotten about that! Oh, I did not want to go at all. I would have to drag myself through therapy. I got online. I guess I was in search of a goodbye. It felt as though I was just doing things, not thinking. I was not even able to find motivations for my actions. A bit after 4:35 pm we left to see Dana.      The last thing I need is to talk about my problems and get all emotional in front of people. I do not want to have to say fine when she asks me how I am. I do not want to have to lie. I do not want to have to tell Dana why I am NOT fine when I answer depressed. I do not want questioning. I do not want to the telling that I am irrational or in a state of depression that will soon pass if it is worked on. I just want to escape and sleep. Leave me alone.     The car ride was a mess of tear triggers and soft, broken singing. My mom tried to talk to me but I wanted to listen to the music and think. I noticed my legs being tense. I tried to relax. Minutes later, I found them in the previous condition again: tight and tense. I began crying for no reason. I was on edge. I needed to go back home. I needed to do what I had planned. I wiped away my silent, unforgiving tears and got out of the car when we arrived. We went inside and Dana popped out from her office, Im running late. Im sorry 10 minutes? Just want I need, to be stuck here forever. I was bitter and angry but inside I was deeply in sorrow. Dana called my mom in 10 minutes later and asked me to wait for a bit. I cant come? I asked anxiously. She told me she would like to check in with my mom for a little just to see my moms opinion on my therapy. I sat alone. I began to cry again. Twenty minutes later, my mom came back and I wandered reluctantly into Danas office.     Kissing Death (#2)  2/4/2004      She said, How are you?  Fine, thanks. You?  Good. Your mom said you seemed upset on the way over.  Oh?  Yes. Was it over the test you took today?  Maybe. I think I failed.  Why would you think that? Did you study? Thats just it. I studied my ass off. I worked so bloody hard and I still didnt succeed. It isnt supposed to work like that.  Sometimes things do. Im very sorry it happened that way, but why do you think you failed?     We continued to talk. Eventually we started to talk about something that actually interested me. I got very passionate about what we were discussing. She even challenged me with new ideas. I began to think: Dana is a smart person. She has made me think about many things I never considered. I started to forget about my sadness, depression, and anger. As we finished talking, she laughed and said, I like you. You have a lot of strongly represented arguments and thoughts. You are so logical and informed. It is nice to see a young person who seeks information under stress and confusion rather than drugs. A conversation with you is like having a ride on a shooting star. You made me learn a lot today, Whitney. I was so flattered. Someone appreciated me. Someone took the time to listen to me. I was strangely satisfied. I had an urge to go off and meet tons of new people I wanted to seek out new opinions and find a new fascination.      On the car ride home I thought to myself, Im okay.  I could not make sense of what caused the sudden feeling of content that came with the love I felt like I had received. How did a conversation about something I took deep interest in make me want to continue? Utter confusion. Yet, it worked. I had a need to fulfill before I could give up and rest.     I do not know if it is temporary satisfaction. I do not know when my suicidal depression will return, but I think that for now at least, I am going to be able to enjoy life a bit more. I write this entry as a reminder of the past. As a reminder of the little things that people can do to give someone a little hope. As a reminder of the idea that things can get better. As an entry of desperation overcome.      Thus, I sign this entry with a kiss.  *kiss*
