And my mom, sis, b-in-law and niece called me to go to Pedra da cebola ( onion's rock ), to check out the "Green Fair", it's an anual fair about piece, nature and bla bla bla.. that was nice and "we" - my niece - had some fun feeding ducks, geese and fishes, then we ate breakfast, well expensive. And then we went to a restaurant - sorry the spelling but i'm not with patience to check if i wrote it right - but the first one didn't acept credic cards, so we had to another one, and i ate tons of cheese and frenchs, YUMMY! But when we were leaving, my sis realized that she had forgotten her credic card - how dumb! -, mom had to drive to another neighborhood and we stayed waiting there for centuries, and my sister and her bf stayed doing those stupid things that couples do. My mom came up and paid the bill... Thank God we went home.  I have 2 tests each day of the next week and i'm not studing as much as i was supposed to. Watever. I will, i promise.
