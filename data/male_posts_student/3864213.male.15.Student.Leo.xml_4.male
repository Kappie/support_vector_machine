'one life avant la fin'  ... im doing my best to not make you worry but everytime im close i fall back down fast... my mind is killing me slowly, my body has become weaker day by day... don wanna lose those i hold dear... hold me tight so i can rest in your arms  find peace with myself...happiness in youisda only way my worries are calm... '  love you always my dear'
