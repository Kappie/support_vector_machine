I will put things off, even though the feeling of "unfinished" drives me insane, I leave things until I can't take it anymore. I'm the type of person who will cut my hair way to short and let it grow out way to long, all in the interest of saving the time it takes to go to the barber. And so. Here's the beginnings of the bio:  I grew up, and still live in, a small town in central Alberta. That's in Canada, for those of you who don't know. The town is called Sylvan Lake, although there is really nothing sylvan about it. The permanent population is roughly 8,000 people, but in the summer, we see roughly a million pass through. The beach is where I spent most of my summers as I was growing up. From the time I was about twelve to when I was sixteen, I spent almost every day of summer at the beach, picking up girls, hanging with friends. Good times, yo! Now, I hardly ever go to the beach. I don't know what it is really, maybe I'm always at work, maybe something about it just got old. Who knows.  I was born in Red Deer, Alberta, on November 7th, 1984. I spent the first few years of life in Red Deer, before moving to Sylvan Lake, about 20 minutes west of Red Deer, where I've lived for the majority of my life.  Musically, I have a pretty broad taste. I like everything from country to metal. Favorites of the moment are Boysetsfire, Pretty Girls Make Graves, Inventing The Wheel, and The Reason.
