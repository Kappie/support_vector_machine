It was a disaster, a cruel lesson to all the ego-pumped bravado-loaded arses like me. No one learned. No one cared, except me. Unhappy times.

I...I have...been asked out on a date. I was taken off the street while doing my route to %#!#$'s house. Her friends asked me if I would ask her out. I was deeply confused. These things don't happen to Dan. I'm normally considered the scary antisocialite, commonly found nibbling on some inhuman morsel and hissing when exposed to natural light. Not exactly loverboy material. But they said #$!@# thought I was kind and a good guy. I told them I don't see %!#$# in school often, so they actually brought her out to talk to me! She seemed as surprised and embarrassed at my visit as I was. We agreed on the weekend and possibly going to Fazoli's for a date, but no time was set. In hindsight, this weekend may be a bad idea. I'm going to the Alma Youth Mix that weekend and will be away for the majority of the weekend. I have to discuss this more with #*@#. I've been walking in a daze ever since. Wow...God hath a sense of humor. I never saw this coming.
