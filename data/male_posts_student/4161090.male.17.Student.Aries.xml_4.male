Normally, i don't share such sorry thoughts, but hey, thats what blogs are for. maytbe i'll just resolve and improve or stay lazy. the key to happiness is to be happy. its as simple as that. if only society wasn't everready to stab you in the back. ah well. cheers. alcohol cures. but i have none now, and i have also stopped drinking. i drank only thrice. now i've totally given it up. i don't like it. i am NOT addicted. that was over a year ago. now im normal. but i shouldn't stray ah well.   have a heart thats it.
