My arms will still be comfort; My shoulder still soggy with tears; My eyes still open, watching; My mind caring about your fears. I want to be forever, I want to live to be, I want to be there with you, I want you to be there with me.  We need to fix the problem, Before it becomes a problem, It’ll just keep to bubble, And only lead to trouble. I care in everyway possible, And that’s why I do this for you, So it lasts many years, And not just a few.  I’ve been told, So many times, And in so many ways, To fight this feeling, And not let it rule my days.  The elders have spoken, And the advice given is good. I think we need to listen, For both of our good.
