Well, the links on the internet don't stick anymore, which makes browsing the web that more more pleasurable, and makes you realise how much you take things for granted. At least a month it was like that, but seems better now. And why? I hear you asking. Ok, obviously I don't actually hear you, but I immagine you would be asking. All it took was a little something called 'disk defragment'. I've no idea what it actually does, other than make the computer work better (post in comments if you know, I would like to know), but it seemed to do the trick. It didn't work when I tried it before, and kept saying 'run scan-disk to check for drive errors'. Doing that, I was told I had too many applications open for scan dick to run, and I should try closing some. Even though they were all closed. Then today I found out I should try ctrl+alt+del and close some from there. Doing that, I left about 5 open, and ran scan disk and defragmentor, which combined took pretty much since 14:00 to now, about 19:00. About 5 hours. Wow, my computer  is  slow. But that bad news about it now working is that the chances of my mum buying a new computer become pretty much zero. I can immagine conversation:  'You want a new computer? You said you fixed the one we have now...'  'Yes, but ours is nearing 5 years old' 'Does it still work?' 'Well, yes, but...' 'If it still works, what's wrong with it?' 'It's very slow' 'So? I won't but a new computer if the one we have now works ok.' *Then comes the real reason I want a computer*  'But our one won't run the newest games' 'So you want me to spend about Â£500 so that you can play games? It's unhealthy to sit there all day playing on that computer...'  I would never win, unless the computer actually blows up, and you can see the pieces of it scattered about the room. So, looks like I'll be stuck with this old thing for a while. I'll get a new one if/when I go to university.  As the defragmenting thing was running, I filled the time by watching the second half of Matrix Revolutions, and Star Wars VI, both excellent films. I also listend to some of my favourite music, whilst juggling. It reallt aches your arms after a while...  Ta ta for now.   Weather:  Overcast, very light drizzle  Reading:  Harry Potter 4  Listening to:  'Good Stuff' playlist - Oliver Twist, Be Back Soon  Watching:  Return of the Jedi, Matrix Revolutions  Confused about:  Chemistry Extension. Esters and Carboxylic acids?!?!?! *Gulp*  Annoyed with:  Nowt really  Mood:  Nearing happy
