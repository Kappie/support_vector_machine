As you know, I'm a WWII junkie, and those that fought in that war were like gods on earth.    Take a close look at the stars on the wall.  Read the caption underneath to put the Iraqi conflict into perspective.  We've truly lost our way...  Oh, the History Channel is about to air Band of Brothers over the next few weeks.  If you haven't seen this, you must!  But I don't recommend watching it on History.  Go rent it, watch it without distractions and interruptions.  It's 10 hours in total, and worth every minute.
