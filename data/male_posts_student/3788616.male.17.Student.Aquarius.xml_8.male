Indeed, as the name suggests, i am finally bucking up... or at least i think i am, really need to work hard, and today marks the 1st day of my Math tuition, i know it sounds dumb to have tuition, but hey... i really need it ok?! so... don't criticise me! i am like crap lah, only with tuition than will i be motivated to work harder! Anyway, i think i am pretty pleased with myself over today's session, cause, i guess, i was able to understand concepts that i didn't initially! haha...  Anyway, there was a GP 'EXAM' today, and well, it was quite alright lah, but the damn compre questions were harder than usual lah! Wah lau, everything also USE YOU OWN WORDS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE! crap lah... Heex... oh well... but, haha... i think the funniest thing was that after the paper, Hiro just kept bitching about Shane! haha... he was like complaining and whining about Shane shaking his legs, clicking his pen, disturbing Hir's focus and concentration, lamenting about how it would affect his work! haha... oh well... Hiro, i've been there and done that, just try to forget about it lah, it's his bad habit, he can't help it! i've come to understand that, hope you would too!  Oh! man... i realised something too, i was a little bit hard on my friend's ex lah, i am sorry about it. But i guess, i was really concerned about my friend, and i really didn't want to see her so hurt, so yeah... Sorry girl if i made him sound like a monster, but, i guess, in my eyes, he is for hurting a friend like you so badly and treating you so badly... yups...  Anyway, thanks to all my friends who have given me encouragement, i really needed it! heex... felt so down and you guys provided what i needed, moral support! Thanks again, people like Seok, Tham, Benjamin, Chris... yup... heex... haha... Jill, you too! haha... ooh! Nice pic by the way! haha... okok, i better stop jacking her before she comes to kill me when she next sees me, or even worse! Don't accompany me back! :p  Hmm... to that person whom i like so much, i don't know what to say lah... just that, i really miss you lots, even though it has been only 1 day since i last saw you. haha... i know it's crazy, but... it's true... ok... i am not going to say more, except that i hope you enjoy yourself and take good care of yourself! Remember ah! Don't injure yourself! This week got MEGA CONCERT! TAKE CARE! Please don't fall sick too yeah?  Ok, i am done for now... will blog somemore soon yeah.
