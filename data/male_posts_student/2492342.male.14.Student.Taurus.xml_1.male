On the way back i wrote 6 pages in a notebook in spanish about it. It's in spanish cause it was easier for me to write it like that when i started in Ensenada. It still is, but y'all wouldn't understand it. I'm trying to translate it all right, but bear with me if some words are jubbed up.  Omyra isn't coming. Nor Juan! I'm going to kill him! Jeez, I can even see his house now. And hers too(Omyra)! II don't even have a photo...I can't find my camera either. Monica is crazy. She's cute(not really the right word, but dont know how else to translate it) cause she wants to die. She doesn't like life and she wants to live three metres under the ground when she gets older. She has a really pretty house though.  I hope that I'll be able to go in March. I wanna see Omyra again and Juan. Heh, he's second. I can't move. The two blondes are making so much noise. Something about hand puppets.  I dont want to go. I wanna stay til the 4th, the day before school starts.  CRAP. School's gonna start in a few days. I HAVE TO MOVE NOW!! and I have two hours to the border. God help me. And still they(the blondes) don't know what I'm writing. It's ugly. (I think i meant the writing cause in the car its scribbled)  Unlike Omyra! Hehe... how many emails do I have already? 50? hehe  I hope(rough translation) that Omyra will call me. But what am I gonna say to her? (i gave my # to Josue and joked with him to give it to Omyra. then we decided he was going to, but not say it was my request lol) Ai  --Two hearts with a name in each, with or in the middle and question marks on the sides--  Ai, I don't know. I can't have more than like for her cause she has boyfriend. Well Juan said that she didn't. (Plus, she said somos novios) But that's what he said before too!!!! Ai....  Hah. Jake just said that there are pretty houses out the window. "Donde estamos?" What a fool. Americans dont know anything about mexico except that they can buy fireworks here. I WANT TO STAY HERE, without these stupid yanquis. Where can i throw away my diet Coke? My nose is being attacked by these people. No one except my dad showered.  Oi, I remember the lady in San DIego in the beginning. (Im gonna write the whole story out. we went to this gas station minimarket after we got mexican insurance and she asks my dad in an accent if theyre together(the sodas) and he falters before saying 'yes, juntos.' so she says in spanish, which is the rest of the convo too, 'didnt know u spoke spanish sorry. is it your son?' dad-  'yeah' oh, you married an american?" lol!!!! i mean, i thought it was hilarous. YOU MARRIED OUTSIDE LA RAZA PURA??!!! God forbid. now think if she knew he was iranian. lol)  I'm so thankful I could go. It's so beautiful here,(we're driving on the coast) the beach and the mountains. I want to return already. I DONT WANT TO GO. I want to stay! I want to wait for Omyra, and Juan, and everyone. I want to be here when it starts to rain.  Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams, Let it wash away, my fanstasies, Cause i wanna see  I don't remember all of it (its a song). I wanna sleep for 12 hours! hehe, more than Monica (she said she slept for no hours last night and likes waking up early). They're talking about massages(the blondes). God help me, I'm gonna die!!! (im really sqooshed)  I had a dream about Omyra yesterday. (im gonna write it again, cause its unclear how i wrote it. I was wlakign down this street, a dirt raod like the ones where i was in Ensenada, and I saw this american flag, except the flag was upside down. There was soemthing about this that happened later, but i dont remember anymore. ANyways, there was this dance where the couples dressed up together and i was going with omyra, but i had nothing to wear. SO i went shopping and got this shirt that said Merry Chrstmas on it. it was red and gray, and i liekd it. Then i saw her face.) SO HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Oi!!!!!!  I hope my cards got to Zelenia and Aisha.  We're in Tijuana already. Im already tired....How will I go to LA? Oh. It wasnt Tijuana. It was Roasarito, a big city by there.  Jeez!!! Already 4 pages!  Im gonna go shower tho right now. Then ill finish this.
