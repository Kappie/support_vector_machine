Cuz today he called in the afternoon to chat cuz he doesnt feel like going to gym. So we talk and talk and then dont know for what shit, I began to be childish again and we bicker lorhz... As though Im his bf like that... Me always want him to give in to me de... Then like that lorhz... I slammed the phone on him... Then around 10 plus I smsed him Sorry and all and told him to call... I think seeing the time now, he wouldnt be calling le... Either VERY angry or tired... Dont care bahz... Me and him no chance le...  Before we argue, he told me he like another guy... I mean, how can he told me such stuff? He know I still have feeling for him and he told me that? I mean, ya, we are friends now but then where can tell me such things de... I dont really feel good but just play along lorhz... Anyway, I wish to forget about him and then move on with my life... I was quite succeed... Until I saw MTVs of gay couple and then I mess it up liaoz... Thinking of my ex le... Still thinking of him now... Sometimes I wishes that he is beside me now and I can hug him like before... But that isnt going to happen...   Anyway... He duped me de... Why should I care so much... Maybe I really didnt treasure him before when we are together... I dont know...   Christina called at 10 plus and tasked me to go out them tomorrow to eat sushi!!! My fav food worz!!! Yum yum yum!!! Agree without any hesitation though Im gonna bankrupt very soon... But never mind de... I'm gonna see my wifes tomorrow le... Wenfong and Wanxin... Missed them so much... Especially Wanxin... She have some problems recently but I hope she is coping well... She's such a nice girl... Told her alot about me and my ex... She knows how I feel and all...   Ya... That's that... Im gonna go find layout for my blog le... Solitude, where are you? :P  Signing off - Ronald
