I need to get them done between now and Friday night if I want a completely stress-free weekend. I won't be able to work on my homework at all on Saturday because I'll be going to see  urlLink Guster  and  urlLink Ben Folds  in Kansas City that day. I'm pumped.  I am very interested in what is happening in the music side of the entertainment industry and in what is going on politically here in the United States. This kind of irritates my wife, because she does really care about that stuff. For me, it's equally irritating when I have to try and justify why I'm interested in the things I'm interested in. I'm pretty passionate when it comes to music and certain things about politics. I don't know why. I just am.
