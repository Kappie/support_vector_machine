The americans. I went to the libarry and got a new book; British: short stories of today. seems to be funny and nice      5-and then i went to the main room, to put my name on the italian class, but it was too late, there no vacancy, and i had to choose another course ( between: french, spanish and germany),    and i chose germany. A teacher had said that soon Germany will be the second country with most influence on the world! Whatever!          Now i'm real fucked! it's just so dificult.. but i'll study and with german on my curriculum..i'll be more than good!
