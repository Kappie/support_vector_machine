As most people know, and the U.S. President would rather you didn't, it is a film by Michael Moore about how corrupt, wrong and generally messed up the George 'Dubya' Bush administration is.  It starts off showing how old Dubya shouldn't have won the election at all, and how his family were involved with not only running the state in which it was all down to, but also the whole vote-counting process. It then goes on to the actual Trade Centre attack, and how he carried on his publicity stunt regardless. Then it goes on to talk about Bush's reign of fear-inducing, and finally the war itself. At the risk of spoiling it (can you 'spoil' a non-fiction?) I'll leave it to you to witness some of the more humourous ways Moore illustrates his points, and the quotes from various officials that range from the disturbing to the downright comical, but if you are A) american, B) not entirely convinced George Bush is a bad president, or C) willing to pay money to see a fat american guy make congressmen run away screaming, then you have to go see this film!  Now watch me take this drive... ;)
