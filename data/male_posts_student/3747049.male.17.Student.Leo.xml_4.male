I think ill just go and take Snow Patrol same sorta stuff as Coldplay roughly.      F1 is back! yay the only entertainment I can rely on for a weekend :p It seems everyones talking about how Jenson Button has made a shock move to return to WialliamsF1 and ditching BAR. I think this has tarnished his appearence and I dont support him as fully as I did before this. Some say hes a traitor but only when BAR and WilliamsF1 go to court will we ever get to hear the full story and if I find that Button moved for money then that would be even worse.  I got a model of his car for this year, its very detailed and limited to 3000, its 1:43 in scale but you can even read the name of the driver, really amazing I cant see this being done by hand..      This summer has been nothing but sleeping and soon ill have to go pick up my A level results which will be a mixed bag of goodies. Full of joy and pain. Atleast ill be able to share it with the very little friends I have left. Must remember to try and make more friends somehow someway within the next 3 years.....if I dont who will i rely on and who will I talk to? Ill end up talking to myself and drinking alone. Uh oh its a bit premature for that I wasnt expecting to do that till im 50. lol.      And for thos intrested the quote is from Travis. And well it rained on my birthday :p      And this is the end my friends. I have nothing left to say.   So goodbye!
