I thought it wasn't too good at the time, and when I got it back in class today, there were no positive comments on it, and not really any negative comments either.   Suggestions of cutting it down in scope and introducing the first person narrator sooner.  Solid possibilities I just feel so frustrated.  When I write a story, I've conceptualized it for over two weeks off and on, and I think that things are set.  To go back and rework is a pain because it goes against what I've already built up.  Perhaps I'll post parts of it as is.  But most likely not.  I keep saying and thinking I've got a great story inside, but it never comes out and I guess that means I talk a lot of shit, without knowing it.
