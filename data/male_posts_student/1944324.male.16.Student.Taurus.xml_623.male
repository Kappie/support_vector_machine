A total fabrication just escaped my lips.  It couldn't in any concievable way have helped me, but it could hurt me in many ways.  Immediately afterwards, I regretted it, but then there was nothing I could do, and nw I feel all guilty.  But what do I do now?  Just say, 'sorry, that wasn't really true?'  I mean I can't apologize if I didn't have any reason.  And why did I do it?  Was it something subconscious?  Whatever it was, it's freaking me out majorly.  Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.
