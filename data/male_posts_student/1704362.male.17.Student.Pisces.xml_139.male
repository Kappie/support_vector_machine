Therefore, I propose that the US Government fund a project to build a Really Gigantic, Expensive Rocket Engine pointing straight up somewhere on the equator. This rocket will be the size of a city, with the pushing force of over 11 trillion horsepower (with optional leather interior, to boot). The R-GERE will fire at midnight every night as it points straight away from the sun. Several years of this will push the Earth closer to the sun, decreasing the length of our year from 365.265 days to 365 days. Or, if we're feeling really ambitious, we can keep it going longer and get it down to 360 days, so we don't have to remember that stupid damn "Thirty Days Have November..." rhyme or however the hell it goes. It doesn't even rhyme right.  Anyway, once we're done screwing with Earth's orbit, the R-GERE's immense and unimaginable power could be used to further other noble causes, such as:   Crashing the Moon into the Earth, for kicks   Souping up a Honda Civic   3-D Planetary Pool    "Since the beginning of time, man has yearned to destroy the sun."    Blowing shit up   Ferrying people to and from "Jimbo's Cosmic Anarchy Zone," where anyone can indulge in sex, drugs, gambling, or manufacturing nuclear weapons, free from the watchful eyes of those Earth governments   Using it to travel back in time to stop ourselves from building such a horrible machine, killing our grandfathers while we're there   Selling it to Bill Gates for heating his Olypmic-sized jacuzzi         info.link:  urlLink http://news.stamen.com/   [Listening to: Got To Get You Into My Life -  urlLink The Beatles  -  (02:31)]
