Anyways this week i have beenso busy that i just had no time to post. I have been at a hockey school all week long. For those who are thinking why are you in a HOCKEY SCHOOL IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER !  Well I'm dont know why us canadians do such crazy things but we do. Plus the hockey season starts in two weeks with the start of training camp. Back on the crazy Canadian thing well Canadians are just friggin crazy when it come to hier kids and our national sport of hockey.  The hockey camp was in Toronto and i was in Oakville. (for those who dont live in this area some days it took an hour and forty minutes to get to the rink.  Then during the week I had to help my dad with some technical issues at work the key one being a presentaion to Universal Studios. I had to make the presentation that one of the employees really goofed up on.  Anyways if you wanted to know why i havent posted this is why  Lates,  Smog
