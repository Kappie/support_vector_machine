I got there today (after borrowing one of their $45,000 Rendezvous' - not a particularly nice vehicle, no matter what Tiger Woods says) and the service manager Felicio (felatio? service manager? the guy really did suck) tried to tell me that it wasn't covered. So I quickly beckoned to Gail "80's Hair" and she reinforced the situation regarding my mirror. I understand that Felatio was just doing his job, but seriously guy, don't fuck with me. I've been on both sides of the customer service equation and I'll assure you, I never fucking lose.  Quiz Night is just a blast. I enjoy it immensly. The topic this evening was rather engaging.
