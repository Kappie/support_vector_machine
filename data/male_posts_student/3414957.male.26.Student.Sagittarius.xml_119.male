I finished my English paper today. The rough draft anyways. Man, I wish I could just win the lottery so I can do what I really want with my life. Money....maybe I should rob a bank. LOL. That would be stupid and futile. Now, computer hacking into a bank....lol, that may work. I could never do that, at least not from my current setup and location.   I tried to setup my router/network briefly. It was pissing me off and I need to clean my room. This next week, I will this guy at work to see if he can't help me out. I know nerworking, enough to get by and troubleshoot at work, but for the first time setup, I would like someone with more experience to walk me through it. I know I can figure it out but I do not want to spend needless hours if I do not have to.   The fountain was dry again today. I saw it on the way to Quiznos.
