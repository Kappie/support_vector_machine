Just immagine... so much time, so little to do...  Back to the real world, I had chemistry and english today. Chemistry was fairly good, with not too many hard questions, lasting an hour and a half. A nice long break, with another walk in the woods followed. And then a sit in the hall, whilst we pretended to do english revision, but actually talked about... well, whatever we normally talk about.  urlLink Nationstates  for one thing. Did a few drawings in the anthology too.   English was easier than I expected. First was comparing 'Half-Caste' to 'Unrelated Incidents', amazingly dull, but not too difficult. Then, ' describe  a shopping centre at night and  describe  a shopping centre during the day. A nice and easy question to finish off all english exams. Just think, I will  NEVER  have to do an english exam ever again.  EVER ....nice...  Oh, and then a rather unexpected happening happened about half way through the exam.... a mobile phone rang.    Horror of horrors! Well, I heard after that the... person whose the portable communication device belonged to was one 'Robert Turner'. Apparently he could be disqualified from every exam. Well, to him I can say only one thing. And that is: Waaaaaaaaa! You must be pretty stupid to take a phone into an exam, even when we are warned every before each exam by some ugly woman with a voice crossed between a crow and a dying cat. 'NO MOBILE PHONES ARE ALLOWED IN THIS ROOM. EVEN IF THEY ARE SWITCHED OFF! AGAIN, NOT MY RULING, THE BOARD'S RULING' What a fool that Robert Turner must be. Hehehe      Weather Clear, warm. Hot and sunny earlier  Reading:  Harry Poter and the Prizoner of Azkaban  Listening to:  The Cheese Shop - Monty Python. Tis excellent  Watching:  Jurassic Park III earlier today. Fairly good.  Confused about:  Robert Turner  Annoyed with:  Half-Caste. I DON'T CARE EVEN IF HE  IS  HALF A MAN WITH 1 LEG, ARM AND EYE. HE NEED NOT WRITE ABOUT IT!  Mood:  Getting tired, generally ok.
