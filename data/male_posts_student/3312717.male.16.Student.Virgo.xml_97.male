I didn't come because I had to get up early tomorrow, I wanted to try to avoid driving after dark, and I had promised Pammy yesterday that I would do something with her if she was able to.  In other blogs, gives us his two cents about our discussions. I'm too lazy to say anything else. Also, Jason, please do what Mattson commands and think of something intelligent to discuss.
