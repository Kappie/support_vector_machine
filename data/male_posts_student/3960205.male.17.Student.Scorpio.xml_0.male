That you beseech each night before you close your eyes to embrace the lovely world of dreams…  It stays with you every moment that you breath…  Every brisk step that you take makes you feel you are drawing closer. The next moment it dances around you like a beautiful fragrance on the wings of wind and flows past your fingers compelling you to follow it wherever it goes…   Am I your need or am I your leisure?  The only one whose touch can bring the world to life and descend upon you as the brightness of the sunrise and freshness of the morning dew…  The only one whose warm company brushes off comatose humor and disperses the weighing melancholy from the evening breeze…  The one that you seek when you feel worn out of the ways of the world and nothing seems right…  The one whom you can turn to and expose all your wounds and be cared for and pampered…  Am I the one? Tell me am I your need?   Am I your strength?  Who fills your heart with new vigor each time you feel weak…  Who revitalizes the fervor and gives you a new lease of life…  Who is the driving ardor that assures you will find your destiny despite all the perils…  The constant zeal that enables you to survive the ever so undulating surge of time…  The reassurance that everything would be fine…  Am I the core of such incessant and pure vigor?  Tell me am I the reason that you live for?   Or am I your love, your ultimate destiny?  The one whose thoughts fill you with a strange delight…  The warmth of whose presence you feel even if you are miles apart…  Whose sweet laughter tinkles in your ears and brings an innocent smile on your face each time you are lost…  The one whose tears you cannot endure for anything in the world…  The one whom you wish to accompany in the walk of life…  Tell me am I that treasured possession?  Am I the destiny that you seek?   Tell me what am I to you?
