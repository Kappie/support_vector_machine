SHe's being stubborn, as always. its about me and jess too. ack.  ï»­ï¯¾ïº´ï®‘ï»  ïº? ~  ill write more later, but now i have not much to say. im going to get pizza. mm.  oh, and aisha says jess still thought me and aisha were..umm....yes. a thing. lol, i said the singing doesnt help.    "u can sing to me if u want to. it's our bussiness, besides,... u have other things"  lol, that's good, that's good.  hm, julia is a weird, annoying, twit. she said she call my mom cause i called her a bitch. dear God. oh, there was some other stuff too, but yes. nothing much else to do. except demand more of what jess said.   ~~A few hours later~~  This night was different. Two people blew me off. lol thats good, i feel loved. Brighton went to sleep at 7 ig uess? And i look like a stalker, cause i imed her a few times while her message was on..oh well. I'll just go back to my first love(s), shannon and company.good idea alex old boy.  ïºŽïº·ïº?ïº? is still confusing me. AHH i still cant get over it that farsi works on this. (that was aisha) oh, and I found out she had another secret back-door, midnight lover besides rene. Some OTHER boy!!! she sure gets around.   Let's talk about rene (ï»²ï»§ï¯¾ïº®). in september, aisha decided to go kiss, makeout with, and then GET TO THIRD BASE WITH a boy named rene. Good stuff, man, good stuff. And listen to this- She wasnt even riding the white pony! I mean, woah, not like her. She said she doesn't even liek him. Now what would she do with someone she did like.....*cough* Jess. wait. holy crap. She liked me. Hm....oh yeah. Hah, I can't write that stuff. *runs away giggling*  The virgin eyes looking at this(brighton! look away!) should not see these kinds of things. Thus, I will refuse to write them, and uphold my standards. Hah. Yeah. I ahve those. Riiight. I mean, I went out with Aisha!........just kidding!!! lol  Now I'm arguing with aisha over her looking like a slut.   [10:52 PM]:  course ur not like... Mr. twinkle toes either   Let's see what that means....Holy hell! what in hell does thta mean?!   [10:54 PM]:  yea, excuse my while i brush crumbs off ur breasts   OHHHHH. WOW. 7 minutes later, I get that. It's a reference to something that happened in october. Well, I had to beg her to tell me what the hell she was saying, and finally i figured out it was about the time i touched/molested rina. and that was the butt. so how was i supposed to get it?! Hm, oh well.  right, back to asking about rene. The one question remaining, that'll make aisha sad. i bet if i keep making references to her being a slut, she wont be sad. lol hmm... i didnt need to. that was incredibly simple.   [11:06 PM]:  If you were having sex with someone you'd tell me? right? or if you were using tampons(practically the same thing, except ur letting paper violate you instead of a guy)?  crap her answer isnt at all reassuring.   [11:06 PM]:  y do u ask?  OH MY GOODNESS U SLUT lol  [11:07 PM]:  omg, no! *laughs* seriously tho?   [11:07 PM]:  because i dont want you to like go do something and me not know anything about it....cause then i feel left out..lol..*cries and turns on sesame street* [11:08 PM]:  i'd nvr leave duckie behind! but... i dind't think...yea   aw ok im happy. im good. im down. forget that two people blew me off. AISHA didnt!!! which makes me cool. tho im guessing the reason is because things are too awkward between her and jess(the rapist/lover of her) that since he didnt come on, i was second best. lol  [11:09 PM]:  that you'd want me to tell u that much   [11:10 PM]:  lol [11:10 PM]:  well u dont ahve to tell me the tampons thing..if you dont WANT to [11:11 PM]: wanna talk about my underwear now?  the rest of the conversation cannot be showed here. sorry brighton, i know you wanted to know what im wearing. ;)  on phone: "what are you wearing..ehhe...I bet you can see right through that..' chris who are you talking to?? 'grandma...' oh ok.  ~el alexio feo  PS im going to tijuana on friday for one night trip after finals. yay. 'tijuana- do ya wanna?'
