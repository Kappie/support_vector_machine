Why does life have to be THIS hard? Think about it. Last year sucked. My dad lost his job in 2002, and was unemployed for about 6 months. Quinn killed himself, and the friends I thought I had left me when they found out I was gay. WTF? Sometimes I just hate life. Ever know what I mean?  I now find out Dez has a bf. Good job Dez! I'm happy for you! I hope you love Nathan as much as you love me! But what about Tony?  As for my day: Today was slow. Nothing exciting happened, except Mr. Kelly wasn't here, so we had Mr. Hale teach us. We were supposed to review Chapters 1-3, but he talked ALL PERIOD! Non stop! I was like, "Was this class THAT boring freshman year?!?!?!" Nothing grand to talk about I guess. Nothing interesting happened today. But oh well.  I guess I will go. I'm chatting with Stefani and Ken, so I guess I don't want to keep them waiting long. I might write more later.
