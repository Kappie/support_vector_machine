Okay so many of you might think that the attack was as much the result of  American foreign policy as it was the megalomania of a deranged terrorist, but really there can be no justification for the hideous crime against humanity. Besides have you ever pondered a moment about why it was America that was chosen for this attack? Why not, say, India or China... which are arguably large enough economies and military powers, an attack on whom would have had more disastrous effects.  I think the reason for the choice was that the USA has stood up against these terrorists. It is the only country which has refused to negotiate with them or for that matter even tolerate them. I think it’s a much better policy than to accept terrorism as a part of our lives and learn to live with it….. as the people of India have been forced to do by a lack luster government. The resilience demonstrated by Mumbaikars on getting back on their feet after the recent terror attack is commendable. Almost as commendable as the lack of any coherent response by the government was deplorable. Just punishing the pawns in this deadly game is not enough. What we did is just reassure our people that the next time the terrorists strike, we will pick up the pieces much faster and probably sentence a few people before waiting for the next one. That I am afraid is not what the people elected these leaders for.
