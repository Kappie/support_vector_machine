After that I went to history, and yet another test....feel purdy good about it too. After that lunch came, and Kaya came over. I was really embarrased that my room smelled so bad, so mad incentive to clean it. After that I went with her to my dad's studio...to help him a bit... I was teaching her to skate, and it was really really fun. So we were at the beach, just sittin there after a nice little lesson, and all of a sudden:  BAM!  Joe pops up out of nowhere. So we go with him to Perry's..where the bad music is blasting, and find out that Dan, Paris, David, and Sheila are all at the beach too! So we went and hung out with them. It was fun, and dan went on another mad speech of his. After  that , we wanted to go eat, so we decided to go to bay cities. I told dan paris and david to walk there, while I go to my house with kaya and joe, to drive to joe's to get moolah...but then we got a call saying....."bay cities is closed!!!" So we had to re-think. I picked them all up...and am by this point...really irritable...b/c I don't want to get my licence taken, and I still want to hang out with my friends. So bleh...I drove them anyway. We decided to go to the Co-Op and got a little bit of food there.  Kaya forgot her money, so I bought us a little something to eat. (So happy....so so happy) So we went to Dan's...and we ate and watched "Detroit Rock City" which was purdy funny. After that...I drove Kaya home...and we talked in my car, and I'm totally happy love style!  Much love goes out to everyone...for putting up with the insanity of me. and kaya...I didn't forget about today...I just didn't want to broadcast it...ya know? ~Elan P.s comments???
