I believe abby won it(I didn't stay long enough) . No boys foil showed but Quincy fenced and took fifth, I believe he got his E. John Karatheodoris was there. Surprising the crap out of me. He fenced very well. There were 10 H.S. Boys sabre fencers, only 8 would qualify for DE's so they split us up into 2 pools. I had the hard pool. well all the known fencers. Igor got all the fencers that nobody had ever seen before. I was with Hammond, salzman,Camilleri and John. I beat everyone except Hammond. This was my toughest bout but w/e. Sweet Revenge. Luigi Camilleri, I have a trophy from my sophmore year when I went to Frosh/Soph tourn...5th place I should have gone to the top 4 but Someone stood in my way, Luigi Camilleri, at the time hewas a better fencer than I was and I trained andsaid the next time we fenced I would take it to him. I won against him and then I stomped on Salzman and then came John. That was the longest bout cause we knew eachother's moves so it lasted kind long. I was happy for john cause he beat luigi and salzman. I then had to face john again in DE I won and had to move on to Jared. This is where I shut down. I was being beaten 8-1 at the break and rob made me realize that I was a better fencer I just had to finish my attack and lose my own. I made a comeback and made it 7-11. The final score was10-15, I lost but I was satisfied considering I know I could have won and we'll meet again. I can't wait to fence Kopylov again. I definitely figured out how to fence him. I have this newmotivation now that I know I can compete with the toughest in the state.
