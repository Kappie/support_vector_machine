I wouldn't call her a friend, since I'd only known her since perhaps October, but I have to be fair and say that we had gotten quite close given the short amount of time, at least close enough that when things started to go sour, I started to get very upset. I don't want to bother to recount the entire incident; suffice there was a supposed reconciliation, only for her to revert back to the habits that I had originally found aggravating, at which point I decided that it was best for me not to speak to her at all. This email that I recently received was an apology, however I can't help but be skeptical of her intentions. Her past apologies were always accompained by a caveat: "I'm sorry, but...", which to me, completely invalidates the apology.       There's another reason for me not to speak to her, that she is associated now with a former friend of mine, a person who was once one of my closest of friends, or so I thought. They had met through me, online, after he left comments on her weblog after having tracked her through comments she left on my weblog. After he had left a few comments, she asked me if it was alright to start up a dialogue with him, to which I replied "what do you need my permission for?" I assumed that my friendship with him would go unaltered regardless of whatever connection he had with her. However, during what would turn out to be the last time I would see my old friends from high school, this friend of mine spoke about a conversation he had with his new online friend, and how she had spoke disparagingly about me, since at this point, I had cut ties with her. He revealed that in the face of the allegations, he had said nothing in my defense. Although I said "you didn't have to say anything", I was actually crushed. He had known her for perhaps two or three months at that point, if that, while he and I had been friends for more than a decade. That I didn't rate even a "aww, he's not that bad" was devastating to me.       I can't help but recall the instances when I would defend my former friend againt insult, regardless of whether he was there to witness it.      It bothers me deeply that I was so easily betrayed, and I can't help but wonder if he might have acted differently had She been a He instead.
