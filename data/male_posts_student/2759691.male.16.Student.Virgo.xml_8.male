The new sign was supposed to show that the speed limit in the residential area is "15 MPH," but actually read "1.5 MPH" after someone put a bolt in the middle of it. Local residents claimed that they noticed several drivers "slam the brakes" as they turned onto the road.  "You couldn't really notice a difference in the older drivers," said one resident, "but when I saw some others I noticed that the sign read the wrong number." Other reidents say that they are shocked that drivers are acutally obeyed the speed limit sigs. Local authorities say that they will replace the sign soon.
