So Jared Dillion's parents had a 4th of July picinic, and my parents let me drive myself so that I could leave before them... It is pretty great to drive alone... Its a lot different then with a permit...  And then I came home and started watching Donnie Darko again cause it was just that good and I know it's one of those movies you have to watch a lot to really get it all... I'm watching it as we speek in a start stop kind of way.  Yeah so... If you want to make me a rabbit suite like the one in Donnie Darko, I will give you rides and love you forever...  Until later...  -Dan V
