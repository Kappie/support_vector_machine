Traffic really pissed me off badly though. It was slow from the skyway all the way to the stadium. We arived 15 minutes into the game, but nothing had happened so it was all good. Bayern Munich who is my favorite team played all their stars unlike Manchester United who played abuncha young kids and like 2 recognizible people. I was mad about that. Plus Tim Howard didn't play which means I now I have a list of things to do before I die, and number 1 is to see him play now that he skipped out on us. Anyways the game itself was actually bad for soccer. Had I been watching it on the tele I would have been very mad. I wasnt dissappointed however just because it was so cool to be where I was and everything. I saw Oliver Kahn and that was one of the big things. Anyway the game ended 0-0 and the crowd booed the shit out of both teams. Twas very very loud. And then they announced there was gonna be a shootout to decide a winner because that was the format of this series/tour. And Alan Smith who was making his debut for ManU and is a well known player shot and Kahn saved it. It was awesome I jumped out of my seat and was like the only one near me because a lot of the fans there were there to see ManU. And Kahn ended up saving another PK and Bayern won the shootout 4-2. I was stoked. It was oh so cool. You cannot imagine.  Monday was the first soccer practice. I played like total shit. It was temendously wet and I kept dropping balls. It was really embarassing.  Today was picture day for soccer and we got goalie jerseys with the resto f the field player unis. They were sort of ugly but I actually sorta liked them. I always tilt my head in pictures and I tried not to today and the guy had to make me readjust my head and I didnt think I was doing it but I guess I was.   I played better at practice following pictures but I still gave up 2 goals I wish I hadnt have. And that leaves me here... sort of. After some ammusing drama, so later.
