A walk to the Snappy Mart at 1:30 to buy a coke to go with the french bread pizza I stole from Tripper was refreshing, in the way that a three block walk can be...memories of high school summers in San Diego, stuck without transportation or supervision, when I'd head out of my dad's condo (now my condo, as far as I know), scale the unscalable wall compound, and hiking across the busy road to one of San Diego County's thousands of strip malls to buy breadsticks or frogen yozurt (as Heidi's brand sold itself).    Or maybe May walks from the loft in Chicago to the community strip, where I could buy Icees or reuben sandwiches at the vegetarian deli (under new ownership).  Lazy afternoons that aren't meant to be lazy when you stay inside and long for something, but as you go outside, you just get lost in the wandering and realize that plans would only serve to get in the way of adventure.    The Natalie Portman look-alike barista at JP's is wearing a ringer T with a stain on the bottom of the front, but more importantly, a  BELLA VISTA VILLAGE inscription on the left breast.  Something like that always deserves recognition, but in my newfound spirit to embrace the newness I somehow left asunder after Big City entered my blood, I referenced it.     Did you get that shirt at a store or have you been to Bella Vista?  She didn't realize that wandering out from the dishes would require conversation.   I just got it at a store.    A pause.  She punched the frequent buyer ticket.  One more punch to a free drink.   He knew Bella Vista.  Well.  Golfing excursions, underage drinking, summers come and gone, forgotten virginities.    It's a retirement village.   He thought that sounded better than referencing his Arkansas past, an homage to a time when he would use California as his home state.  That time still exists.   Her disinterest hadn't changed since her emergence.   Well, what can you do?   Indeed.
