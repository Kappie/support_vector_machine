We had one today first period and I crushed the opposition (namely Nathan).  I'm curious, Marten.  Who else reads the blog but doesn't write? (besides Ryan).   In terms of the Thomas situation, anytime you see that he's online, IM him with  Post on the Blog!  every five seconds.  If we all do this, he'll have no choice but to comply.  Do not, however, use the same strategy with me and Corndog. In other news, I'm ditching MMtto??? as a section, and I'm going to add something new.  Right now I'm going with random capitalized comment of the entry.  This one is: ARGLE BLARGLE IS NOT MY CHICKEN'S NAME, SO STOP PUTTING WORDS IN MY SPLEEN! With any luck, they'll get progressively more random. Michael, explain this shoutout to me please. Sophia, good luck with that I guess, and I hope you feel better, too. Marten, nice endy thingy Finally, Why in the Hellenistic era doesn't the blog link to  Tales , yet!?!?  Good Lord, there's a modem in my shoe!
