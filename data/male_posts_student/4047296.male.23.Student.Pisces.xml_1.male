I have this habit of staying up really late and being productive, but then i am tired the next day and sleep in sometimes and the whole pattern starts over again. I wrote this one of those nights. It turned out pretty well. I really enjoy poetry. It's a good venting mechanism, especially when i am in my Engineering classes. I sometimes write my best while learning about fluid mechanics and statics and especially dynamics. Sometimes i laugh at myself from its irony. And then people ask me: "Why do you stay up so late?     Dark Hour by Jared Nelson   When the hour is late and the sound  Doesn't make its way through glass panes  Or through the trees of shady lanes  Or upon the shifting grains of sand  Look to the next day for your answer  Seek tomorrow to sooth your sorrow  For the night and its curses  Take hold like black hearses in flight to graves  Quiet and dead, silent and fed  By darkening demons demanding doom   Rooms can offer no light  To fight the plight you're in for  Against the sunless lands you're trapped in  Men hardly understand the battle  Of good and evil  When the boundless beams of beauty  Give up their duty for the day  And the devil makes his way  Upon this playground built for him   So pack up your books and bags  Take hold of the grace to be had  Of the soothing savior shunned   Bundle up in your beds and rest  God bless your soul that He tests  And save your might to fight in the morning  When mourning and sadness can be won  By the forgotten One and His words of wisdom sung   Go to sleep and sink deep  Into that land of disbelief  Dreams are the gauntlet you meet and pass through  Feet must rest and faces must falter  Before the dooming darkness alters its halter  On the horse of your life  You ride so swiftly toward the light  Some day you will shine so bright  And He will bind the night  To offereverlastinglife   And ever grasping light   So sleep peacefully each night  And let your meek soul thrive  While the coffins gobble weaklings  And the restless neighbor sins  And the endless ocean bends on end  And the tranquil trees fight the wind  While your lover's lips deeply breathe in  Awaiting a kiss  In the morning that's full of bliss
