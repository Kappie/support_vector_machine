At lunch I worked out at the gym and after work Cindy and I went to my grandma's after I burned a CD with a slideshow of the pictures from our vacation.   The food was okay, there was Earthquake cake for dessert (which had coconut, yuck). The conversation kinda turned political with people complaining about people who criticize Bush. I just kept my mouth shut, a lot of them don't realize how uninformed they are, but I correct people too much, so I'm trying to make a habit of stopping.   Then Cindy and I arrived back, we watched Newlyweds, then went to Tops for conditioner, I dropped her and the rats off at her dorm and went to bed.   Thursday was fun. Laura stopped by around 3:30 after work and we made plans to go to Dashen Ethiopian food and watch a movie at Movies 10. We did. Our waitress was kinda non-English speaking, which was fine, except I wanted BREAD and she only heard WATER. I needed water too. :)   We wanted to see Man on Fire, but we ended up seeing Day After Tomorrow since we were 15 minutes late to Man on Fire. But DAT ended up being a decent movie. Lots of scenes were good, the graphics were good and we laughed since the President and Vice President reminded us of Bush and Cheyney.   Laura dropped me off and I came back to find Cindy on my couch, a nice surprise. We watched TV for a while, then went to Tops (our new favorite place) to buy some supplies. I needed to make cupcakes for the coworkers Friday and I had a coupon for the boxed mix. I asked Cindy if I had any eggs in the fridge and see promptly said she saw a carton of a dozen.   I dropped her off and came back to find no eggs in the fridge. Dang! So instead of buying them then, I got up early in the morning, drove the Tops, bought some eggs, came back, baked 29 cupcakes and furiously rode to work to deliver them.   They are good! Everyone enjoyed them.
