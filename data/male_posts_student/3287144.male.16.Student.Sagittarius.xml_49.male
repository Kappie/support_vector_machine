I mean I got to the bottom of my problem with my computer running slowly - Norton Anti Virus apparently but it has also been so tiresome on me; after a number of things going wrong after my interference I sought consolidation in a friend, I use the term loosely as I have my suspicions to whether she likes me, and in keeping with my suspicions she was as cold as ever toward me.  So what good has come of today? I did minimal work and so now feel naturally unsatisfied with myself and I have a cold and everyoneâ€™s being mean to me and... and... *Cries*. Seriously for a moment though, I always feel so much younger in the sense of being 'immature' when I feel low like this, I don't know why but I do - perhaps it is because when we are children we have more moments when we do feel so insecure and so our experience of being insecure comes mostly from a time when we were immature hence we go back to that immature nature when we are insecure. Maybe.
