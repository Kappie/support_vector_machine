I went to pick up my sister from the mall (and saw people I knew, like Marissa Johnson and a few others), and that's all I've done since I finsihed bagel.tech today.  I don't want to lose interest in this blog!!!  I need stuff to talk about.  So tomorrow, I'll be going on location to somewhere else, and probably doing an audio post from that place.  I don't know yet, but, I want to get bagel.tech done early, just so that I can go.    So, this I Could be Asleep thing.  It's the name of my old blog, back in my days of Xanga.  I had plans to start porting posts from that old blog to here, but, a lot of them were mysteriously gone... good thing I like Blogger better.  It just might be the best blogging software on the whole entire interweb.  And speaking of Blogger, I kicked off this week's Blogger week at bagel.tech with a tip on how to create a search bar so people can search your posts, like you can see on both of my blogs.  It's a really cool tip, go check it out, because its the first step in making your blog better.    And, about a third blog.  I'm working on how I want to do it, and the temporary title of it is going to be "Bagel 3."  It's going to be the last blog in the series of the Bagel's Blog network, and I have no idea what its going to be.  But, I'm going to go ahead and start constructing it, but, you won't see anything until August.  I want to have enough time to create a purpose for the blog.  It's not going to be a videogame blog, or even a movies blog, like I've been thinking about, but, it's going to be something very different.  Look for more details in the coming future.  I could be asleep right now, but, I have to stay up to do tonight's Late Night Bloggin', which is taking the world by storm.  As far as I'm concerned, there are several different people looking at this blog for the shear purpose of my Late Night Bloggin', mainly because their blog has been featured (either that, or my advertising is working, and I've been advertising a lot lately).    That's it for this edition of Blog of Bagel.  I'll be back later tonight with Late Night Bloggin', so, check it out.
