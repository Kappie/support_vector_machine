Both got hugs, handshakes, asides just for them, and a cool $20 in my palm from Gran V.    For the past week, I did nothing of consequence.  I woke up late.  I went for coffee.  I flailed at crossword puzzles.  I watched a lot of baseball.  I went to the gym.  I spent two hours each day at the gym.  I watched old movies.  I chatted with people at least 20 years older than myself, most at least 40 years older.  I flailed at my writing.  I went to the theatre.  I went shopping.  I went walking.  I went driving.  I drove swank cars.  I drove a pimped Infiniti and three pimped Mercedes.  I sat at the pool.  I played golf.  I played golf in nothing but my board shorts, hitting 120 yard wedge shots to 10 feet.  I played golf and then got in the pool.  I got in the pool and then played golf.  I watched more movies.  I ate ice cream.  I walked Palm Canyon Drive with one grandparent on either side, providing a buffer between the two as they asked each other questions that the other couldn't hear.   Frank?  Frank?  Fra-ank?  Virginia?  Virginia?  what?  Virginia?   I relax better in Palm Springs than in any other city.  It's always been that way.  Palm Springs was the vacation spot when I lived in California...rich grandparents, a pool, and sometimes we'd bring the Nintendo.  Frank would go in the yard and we'd play whiffle ball or hit whiffle golf balls.  We'd go to the water park.  We'd eat quality hamburgers at quality restaurants.  My sister and I could go the whole week just wearing sandals, if that.  Little has changed.  The whiffle balls are now real golf balls, as I break the rules and walk onto the course they live on to hit my practice strokes.  The grandparents have more money and less years to spend it in, the pool is just as beautiful.  The nintendo is replaced with my laptop, providing ample entertainment when the old folks get ready for bed (which is usually midnight, those caddy devils).  And the water park is where the gym is.    For the first time since I played high school soccer, I established a gym routine.  Repetition for the week.  Thirty minutes of cardio.  Forty minutes of weights.  Fifty minutes of relaxing in the outdoor pool, swirling in the healing waters and looking up to see beautiful bikini babies bob by.  They were always on the other side of the fence, though.  I was on the geriatric side.  No problem.  The workout was all the energy and release and catharsis and inspiration I needed.  You work hard, then you relax for a bit.  Religion for the physical self.  Definition exists on the right bicep, the first definition since I weighed 135 (five years, 30 pounds, and one femur shatter ago).  I feel better.  I breathe easier.  I am a lot darker (though I still have the whitest ass that human retinae can visualize).    My problem with the gym isn't in working out.  It's not even finding the time to work out.  It's finding the time to relax after you work out.  You go to the gym, get on the machines, go for a while, finally stop looking at the clock when you're on the cardio, start with the weights, and soon you're there 90 minutes and pushing your next appointment/place to be/book to study.  The hour of denoument that I came to know and love this week isn't there, and even if you can find 10 minutes to get in the hot tub, your view is of dry wall or musky windows, not the San Jacinto Mountain and the Coachella Valley, not to mention the tan bikini crew.    I'll try to establish the workout routine when I get back from California...maybe a bit in Arkansas, and maybe a bit in North Carolina.  But the relaxation exercises are imperative.  Can a long shower take the place of celestial waters?  Only if you're sharing the shower with a soft-skinned beauty.
