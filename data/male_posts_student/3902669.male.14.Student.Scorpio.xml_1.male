No. I definitely shouldn't feel like that because I was invited. It's just that I am sick. See how confusing I am! Well I succeeded in spreading the germs to my mom, who in turn said 'thank you'. Haha..I'm sure she appreciates it. Hopefully my dad won't get sick. At this time in my life, I'm feeling very incomplete. I am grateful that I quit karate, but at the same time I feel like I didn't finish my time there (which I didn't.) I do nothing all day, I barely work out anymore, and I feel like I'm just wasting away. At least when I went to karate I had something to do. Hell I even had a job!! Do I regret leaving karate? No. I had to leave at one point or another. Doing the same thing every single day, and having drill sergeants shout and push you at the same time is not fun. I'm still waiting for Aubrey to dye my hair green! I think it's going to look so kick ass, even though I know my parents will hate it. Hey, thats what teenagehood is about isn't it ;-)
