I never meant to hurt you, but you? Yeah, I hope you bleed a lot. Running away doesn't seem to stop it, and the heart inside beats twice for one. Stress is climbing ever higher, passion's out of reach forever. Stained. Used. Not washable anymore.   Do you know how I truly feel? I'm not allowed to say it...that would be wrong. But what is right? Right is fake and false and passed, shattered by reality. And now I'm turned aside and unwanted, and now I'm wrong for being me. What's wrong with caring? What the fuck is wrong with caring too much? What's wrong with loving, what's wrong with wanting, what's wrong with me? I could be perfect, if only you'd open your eyes.  You're so hurt and jaded and bitter. You're so helpless and insecure and just plain mean. I don't want to be too. How do I stop it? Because truthfully, nothing makes sense anymore. It's all nonsense, as if it was ever meant to make sense. Try so hard to be good and pure, make a few mistakes, and you're ruined, plagued, cursed.   You're gone now, and I'm beyond proving anything. Your legacy is unwanted, and now I'm blank, and scared, and misguided. Trying so hard for something not mine, never wanted, always hated. Now I'm left behind.   I hate you, but I hate you more. Am I allowed to hate? Because if I'm not, I guess I'm making another mistake. I've killed you a thousand times. Sometimes I imagine your pain and Iwant tosmile. Then I imagine mine, and I blink, and it's too real. And it's in that mirror, and it's in my mind, and it's in those jeans, and it's so real and thick I can smell it, and it clings to me like skin. I want to purge it all. Where's my saved game? Why can't I go back?  I'm not him anymore...no and never will be again. I don't want help, and I don't want to feel better yet. I'm not done dealing, I'm not done hating, and I'm not done frowning. Fuck you. You bring me up, you strike me down. You leave a kiss, you draw a wound.   Can't escape it. Must acknowledge it. Cannot change it. Death. Disease. Betrayal. Failure. Disregard. Fear. Life. Hello?
