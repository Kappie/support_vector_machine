Bump-mapped EVERYTHING.  2. My english teacher. Holy shit, she just needs to admit that she's a total bitch so we won't hate her as much. She spent all last period calling Binh a moron, and then trying to say "I don't really mean that!" when all she was doing was covering up. I was like "How the fuck do you get off, you stupid bitch?!?!"  She didn't hear that, but i said it. Really!  3. Comedy Improv thingy. Yes, I went to a comedy improv show, like Whose line is it anyway, except there are 8 people and the points ACTUALLY MATTERED. Really? Yes.  The first 2 or so sketches were gag inducing shit-your-pants funny, but by the end it was merely hillarious. :-O  I was gonna type more, but then I went downstairs and forgot what I was saying. Oh well.
