Guy is even posting weekly  urlLink diaries  of their studio recordings in California.  Mark's got a new Pensa guitar of late, and after taking a look at his fret playing in detail, he seems to experiment with a variety of electric guitars over the years, even though the strat is probably the dearest to straits monomaniacs like me. Stratocasters (the early Dire Straits "strat" sound), the les paul gibsons (the "calling elvis" sound a.k.a. Jimmy Page, Slash, Gilmour etc.), the national 'o' style (on the cover of  Brothers in Arms ), the pensa suhr (MK's personal favorite), telecasters, et al. The sultan of swing seems to have played virtually every electric guitar.  I wait with eager anticipation. It's exciting to hear about MK working on another album, and working, hopefully, on material that is atleast as good as  Sailing to Philadelphia , and pray, not on the lines of  The Ragpickers Dream . Ragpickers was just too country, too celtic and too oldies style, moreover, without any of his signature fingerpicking. Well, we didn't notice it anyways!  Will Straits regroup? "They might!", is what everybody I talk to, says. Not sure whether there's a touch of diplomacy or sheer optimism with that remark. Even if they do, I hope they reunite with their original classic lineup of MK, David, Illsley and Withers. With due respect to Alan Clark, Fletcher and the others who joined Straits in the 80s and 90s, (and I guess, who are still a part of his solo recordings), we desperately need the  best  lineup back on the circuit. Imagine MK playing his pinched harmonics on that fender red strat and David on his own, supplying the "white" rhythm in the background. Nice and laidback. But chances of Straits cutting an album with that lineup are less, given the fact that MK is a self-confessed country music fan, and the other threesome, not ready to don the roles of puppets once again. Personally, a reunion in the form of a live gig is asking and expecting enough, especially to satiate my desire to see MK strumming in front of me, with my jaw dropping.  For now, though, let's just wait and see if the new solo cut is a fresh lease of life for MK fans or just a baloney again!?
