It became kind of frightening, and frankly, with people's secrets, comes responsiblity I would rather them give to me and not take upon myself. Maybe I'm maturing, or maybe I'm just bipolar and half insane. You make the call. Blog more later! Talent show coming up tomorrow, need my sleep. Blog tomorrow or Sunday to let you know how it went! Laterness!  In Christ, Mike >
