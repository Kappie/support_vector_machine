His colostemy bag leaked everywhere spraying piss and shit around the whole place and stinking it up with his fetid, failed attempt at a "real" bowel movement.  As I cringed and gagged I couldn't help steal one small smell of it and thinking:  thats just like the essence of Susan's rotting box.  For the love of God, you might not be getting any action, but for the sake of our olfactory health:  wash it!    Vomitously Yours, The Diva
