The Mojave Airport has been officially certified by the FAA as a spaceport.  Watch for the first civilian flight by Scale Composites on Monday, the 21st!  Looks like the FAA has been involved in proper controls as we transition to a  urlLink civilian space program  over the next few decades.  Good to see.
