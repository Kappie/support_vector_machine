There is this one 8th grade saxophone girl who's marching skills rival penis-heads playing skills. God she was stupid. I had to do a whole lot of yelling. Afterwards, one of the more depressing things thats happened to me in a long while came to be, but I'm not going to get into that......(I get the strangest feeling other people are reading this other than me)......Doc asked my brother, Dylan, if he would carry the banner in tomorrows parade. Stupidest thing docs done in a long long time. I don't really have much homework, so I think I'm just going to sit here and reflect on today's depressing event.....or jack off, whichever I get the urge for.  No quote today, but if you ever hear anything incredibly stupid, send it to me at HamHamInTheHouse@aol.com
