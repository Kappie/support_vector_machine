" He has done what needed to be done because if Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden had their waym none of us would be around in 10 years."  On Clinton.... Clinton had a lot of tea parties with celebrities, but right after his term, somebody flew two planes into the Twin Towers. What do you want- somebody who keeps your children safe or somebody who throws nice tea parties?"  That's throwing some mighty fine heat Mrs. Hunter.  At least all supermodels aren't stupid...
