The Seasons     Summer turns cold into autumn... The trees lost its leaves... Animals moving to warmer land...  Autumn turns colder into winter... The trees covered with snow... Weak animals freeze to death while strong animals fight through  winter turns warm into spring... The trees grow new leaves and flower bloom... Animals come back from the foreign land...   Spring turns hot into summer... Plants starts to dry up... Animals hide in the shelter or cool themselves with water...
