Tyler and I jammed to the beach after school and did some body boarding. the waves were small, but just big enough to have some fun. mike then joined us a little later and it was a blast. so we leave at 5:00 cuz i have work at 5:30. welp it took us an hour to get back to salinas.... huge traffic. got home at like 6:10, threw off my wetsuit (which is actually mike's) and did a "dip" in the tub to get some sand / saltwater smell off. got my uniform on, and my mom pumped out 3 overeasy eggs, some english muffins, and oragne juice... WOW that was the best meal i ever had.... its not WHAT i had, its just how much i needed a warm meal. so me and tyler engulfed our food and went to work. yes, we both went...  tyler and i worked together tonight. it was better than normal obviously. we got out late and my bro stopped in to help close, so it wasnt all that bad. yea no now im here.  these next couple weeks are going to be a lot of work, but once summer hits BAM good stuff will happen. yep.  airsoft monday, yea, im pretty pumped about that. good good.  tyler and i had a huge debate, which mike also joined to a certain extent, nothing was ever settled, nobodies opinions changed except mike turned against me. oh well. i love debating.... it is fun to me in a weird sort of way. debating makes me think, and i like thinking (at least about thyings worth thinking about). but its over now and we all hate each other. no, we dont, i was just kidding.  glens blog is hip, i like it. hes going to hume for the summer, we are all swimming in our tears. no, were actually not, that would be impossible and really gross to swim in your tears. we are all very happy for him. glen wins. yes. hip hip!  these times are good times, i hope they stay this way. and i hope i survive the last part of school. i also hope a cot of lions doesnt break loose and knaw off any of my limbs tomorrow.  so everyone is staying up all night. everyone being tyler and mike. i am thinking about it but i dont know, we'll see what happens. i do have some things i could do. nevertheless i am going to stay up very late. i wish it was tomorrow. i would have even more things to do. but yea, it should be interesting tomorrow to see our numbed reactions from sleep deprivation.  i may make another post tonight depending on how late im up, well see. peace.  glen smallman - glen is the assistant youth pastor. hes a rockin guy. he comes up with a plethera of good ideas. he has good taste in a lot of things like music and such. which makes him maximum cool. i like glen, hes great to the max. i hope he doesn't die soon, that would make me sad.  current ear-filling: friggin salt current sleep state: tired but still strong
