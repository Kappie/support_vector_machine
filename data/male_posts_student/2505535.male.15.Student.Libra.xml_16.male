I think my dad's taking me and Dave to see some band he likes tonight, apparently they're really talented, not what I really listen to, but it should be interesting at least, and he seems to be really eager, but doesn't really want to go alone.  And now I have alot of time to burn, gunna use most of it up on Shemnue and Shemue 2, then maybe some other Dreamcast games. I think I'm gunna by Fantomas's new album (Delirium Cordia? or something along those lines) and also the latest Tomahawk Album - Mit Gas, and if I still have money left.. Sonic Heroes =D and I've got to get Conner a birthday present, have no idea what to get him, I'll prob end up getting him money as requested.
