Well I for one just hate when that happens. here goes : I met my friend bob (aka robert ) at the beginning of the year . I found out a few months ago that him and my friends (bestest :- D) ave and kaitlyn clash horribly when put together in any situation. So since today was an early dismissal day , during P.E we had a free game day . I checked out a basketball and Bob came to play . We just shot around for a while unlit ave and kitty (kaitlyn) came along and wanted to play as well . So vve were all playing around  for a few minutes when Bob asked to see the ball to try to make a shot. I knew that he could easily get the rebound so I declined. Then kitty ( being a little shorter than my little sister ) wanted the ball. I knew that it would take a while for her to get the rebound so I gave her the ball. All of a sudden Bob got really pissed so he left. I didn't really understand why, but he came back since he still wanted to play w/ david. So then , while ave was taking out the ball (I HAD MADE THE SHOT) Bob was trying to block her . In an attempt to distract her, he brought up the fact that she was still in a fight w/ her ex-best friend . She got pretty pissed so she stopped playing. He kept playing while kitty was comforting her. Afterward , during passing period, I said hi to him and the jackass flipped me off for no reason! Can any of you see a reason for that ........ cus i cant
