It is incredibly hot in the 'info-bar' here I am, in the gorgeous Copenhagen Business School - business schools being generally nice for obvious reasons. First thing to say: do not stay in  urlLink Sleep-In Heaven  if you actually want to sleep. The IKEA sleeping barn is located right next to the IKEA bar and common area, in somewhat un-IKEA backpacker noise is generated until 2 in the morning. Lying in bed I nearly fell asleep until some Australians got in from the bar and woke me up, mostly by making me panic that they were stealing my stuff. Then I found it really hard to get to sleep. Evidently I was not the only one - every five minutes new sleepers would enter the dorm and make noise and there'd be a chorus of ten people simultanously shushing them. I thought that that was really gay, but I guess at least it was an international way of telling someone to be quiet. Then at 8 everyone got up, including me. I was in a massive hurry to get to the Business School for my conference breakfast, but when I got there it was just a croissant - a far cry from the fried filth buffet they had laid on at Lancaster. They're feeding us pretty well though - the lunch buffet had some really awesome roast beef. That said, I fucking paid enough for it. Anyway, those Australians, apparently Sydneysiders, made me realise how joyously dislocated I am - their accents sounded so weird to me, but I also haven't reaclimatised to the whole English thing - all English people sound like Northerners to me (except a few Essex people) with their clipped vowels. I'm sweating too much in here now, so I'm going to fuck off.
