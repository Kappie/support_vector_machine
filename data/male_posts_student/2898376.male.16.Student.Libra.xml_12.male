'When I was a boy, my uncle called me up to his deathbed, and said; 'Son, there are a hundred things every man's gotta know in life. And here are 39 of them. 1. A virgin don't never drive a Z-28. 2. Never bet the ranch on your prostate. 3. If it's got an adam's apple it's probably a man. 4. Never trust a gay gypsy with the palm of your hand. 5. She didn't accidentally get good in bed. 6. You can't join the church if you're already dead. 7. A work uniform ain't totally nude. 8. Brim  bass ain't seafood. 9. When there's guns in the house one better be yours. 10. Don't be nekkid next to any fishing lures. 11. If there's girl scout cookies she's a little too young. 12. If you say "I do" be the ugly one. 13. Don't ever let a bald man borrow your comb. 14. Never play strip poker in a nursing home. 15. Don't blame your pallbearers cause they don't show if you're buried in the middle of the Super Bowl. 16. Let people borrow money and they'll leave you alone. 17. Never fry bacon without a shirt on. 18. Never spray water on a hornet's nest. 19. A woman rarely aces the drivers' test. 20. The sign probably don't really mean massage. 21. Never threaten anybody in camoflage. 22. Say you love her til she lays down the butcher knife. 23. Never put the move on the boss's wife. 24. She's messin' round on you if your briefs don't fit. 25. Never trust a hitchhiker to baby sit. 26. Cosmo's never in a happy home. 27. You can't cut a deal with a kidney stone. 28. A politician ain't got an HMO. 29. Washing her hair means she don't wanna go. 30. Don't ridicule a biker about his tatoo. 31. You been married nine times? Hell, maybe it's you. 32. "Doom" ain't the same as "Donkey Kong." 33. If he's wearing high heels you might have raised him wrong. 34. The clinic ain't the best place to pick up dates. 35. Don't rent a room from a man named Bates. 36. A tank top's never on a billionaire. 37. Stevie Ray Vaughn missed a note here and there. 38. How many get to heaven? No one knows. 39. But hell will be asses and elbows. And then he died. Just rolled right over and died. I never did find out what those other 61 things were. So if you think you know, why not contact me?'
