I guess he makes up for it kinda he is nice to like evry one. But he has a serious problem unless he hurst some one he really cares about he wont give a shit. He has conned a lot of ppl out of money he is good at it he doesnt mind. But he hates it when ppl dislike for no reason he tries to make everyione happy see he is the con-man that wants to be everyone's best friend.  One thing he needs to work on is evaluating risk and having the balls to fallow through with the capable some situations are easily avoidable if you can think through the possibilities. Normally Rem is good at it but lately he has been lacking in this skill  "hey, Love does funny things to yah" says rem.  I dont even know why im writing this one Rem just wanted to sill his guts on some things so here I am writing for him.
