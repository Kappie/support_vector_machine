Official cross country practice started on Monday *yay!!* (not...). We started 2 a day practices today. I am going to be dead by the end of the week. NOT looking forward to it. It just seems so much harder to run this week, I don't know why. Probably the heat, MAN it can be hot out. Damn Nebraska weather...This morning it was cool, but like 125% humidity. There was fog up the ass, you could like only see 20 feet in front of you, it sucked. I'm already very tired, and I have to leave in 10 minutes to go and run some more! How fun.... Who knows how much longer I'll be able to do this. I am gonna start trying to get to bed by like 9 or so, no more of this midnight crap. *Yawn* Today I had a second interview at Amigos (like 2 months later). After the interview the guy said that I would have a job. It won't be for a few weeks though. He said that he would call in a week or 2 to set up another meeting for filling out paper work. I just wonder how I'm gonna fit this in with cross country. We'll find out later....So, if you like mexican food COME PAY ME A VISIT EVENTUALLY!!! Sure it's not the best job, but hey, at least it IS a job...hehe.....Well CC awaits!!! ADIOS....AMIGOS AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!
