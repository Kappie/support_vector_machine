Everytime i finished with the first step it asked me to sign in and i tried signing in with the screenname i had just made and it didnt work. so i kept trying new names over and over and over. Soon enough i had found out that an hour had gone by. Since i knew my friend had already made one i asked to make one for me. SO I asked her if she would make one for me and she said yes. Five minutes Later she imed me back and she told me it was done. So she tells me to try signing on with the screenname she made for me and a password she made up. SO i tried and tried and it wouldnt log in. SO i quit. GOt off the computer and went to hang out with my friends. we were sitting at my friends livingroom and i was watching them trying to fix their Playstation2. Then i came back and tried signing on and i finally was able to get on and this is how i got to typing this. Thank you for helping me even though this is a gay screenname.(i know u could of come up with something better
