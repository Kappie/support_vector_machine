I decided to go to Beckenham Junction to get the ticket, as there’s never a man in the ticket booth at Clock House, and I don’t like buying tickets from machines (They always steal your money, or are broken). I walked to Clock House from there. I was supposed to meet Steve here, but we foolishly managed to miss each other, so ended up getting different trains to the same place. Apparently he waited for me, whilst I got on the first train :) I met Megatrobe on the train, and together we took a trip up to Charring Cross, where we waited for the others. We were all there within half an hour. Not very good timing then…  First we decided to go to the British Museum, which is supposedly very interesting, but being teenagers, we had no appreciation for fine artefacts from ancient times. So we left after about 20 minutes. At least it was free to get in though. Next we walked for a little and decided to go for a walk along the South Bank of the Thames, to see if we could get further than we did last Thursday. So, crossing Tower Bridge, we walked along the riverside, whilst fantasising about us owning a similar ship to the HMS Belfast that we saw along the way. We only got to London Bridge when we all got hungry, and decided to find some place where we could find some products for consuming. We found a pleasant area with a glass roof over with cafes nearby, and ate our food which we purchased in the London Bridge Station shop. Only £2.99 for a sandwich (I had a baguette/roll thing), a packet of crisps (McCoy’s), a chocolate bar (Twix) and a drink (Lilt). Pretty good value methinks.   We then continued walking along the south bank until we got to the Tate Modern art gallery, where we looked at a wide variety of… ‘art’. Rubbish, weird mirrors, plain coloured pictures, strange films and random models of cars and balls in glass tanks. The best was a giant spider though :) Spent about an hour in there, but we soon got aching legs, and took a walk over the millennium bridge, (which used to wobble) and straight to St Paul’s Cathedral. We didn’t stop there, but walked on ‘til we found a station, Blackfriers. Here nonnesuch left us, and the rest of us took a tube to Embankment and the walked to Charring Cross, where we got a train back to Hayes. (Me and Steve got off at Clock House). We then walked the rest of the way home.  Overall, I spent 7 hours 50 minutes out of the house (yes, I timed it :)  ), and was a very good day, if not tiring. Didn’t do much when I got home.  Bye for now.
