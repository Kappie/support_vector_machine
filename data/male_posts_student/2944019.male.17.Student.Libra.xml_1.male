I actually got 3 correct items out of twenty! Second is I also got a low grade in my another quiz which is 16 correct items out of 42. I'm not that um disappointed. I even laughed hard! I don't know why did it happened to me. So ironic...  Uh oh... Filipino, Sociology and CoArc... I wonder if the professors are gonna get mad at us because of that damn strike that happened last Monday, my classmates decided not to go to those classes! Imagine, all of my classmates decided to cut class (I'm also included)... Eh karamihan naman dun mga matatalino! Grabe, ang galing talaga na mag-impluwensya ng mga classmates ko nung first sem! Hay naku, bahala na...  Langya naman tong friendster, walang mga picture na lumalabas... $#!+
