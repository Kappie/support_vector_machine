Food that was actually killed by one of my relatives.  Drunken revelry and hours spent hiding from the camera.  All in All it was an interesting weekend.  More and more I realize where I come from when I go to these things.  I think everyone needs to have some kind of large family gathering where there is booze to keep them grounded.  You get an oppertunity to see how crazy you will be in 30 years, and that is good for everyone to keep in mind.  Alright well I'm going to end with me taking a cue from aaron and telling you folks what I'm listening to and watching or basically whatever has captured my interest inthe last five minutes.
