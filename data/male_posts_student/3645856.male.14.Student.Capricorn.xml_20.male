I was wondering why he hadn't called... so I got a call from him one day and we've been going to Busch Gardens in Williamsburg... I spent the night at his house one night and I repainted his bedroom because of the half-assed job he did... so I had to touch everything up with a tiny artists brush meticulously because he didn't have the common knowledge to tape the walls around the trim. He didn't have the judgment to not go during heavy downpours of rain and he wanted my dad to drive us there, but he had to go to work, so I went home as it was kind of pissing me off. His dad took us today is it was only misting on and off. I also got to meet Josh's friend Hillary who was really nice. Josh seemed to be nice to her... at times... but there were also other times where he was an ass and was throwing water on us and it was freezing as hell (that makes no sense unless hell has frozen over... which means Shelly is now a stereotypical hippie... roflmao... anyway,Josh was being a bit of an ass at times, throwing water on both of us and we were freezing. My shirt is still drying... he also calls her a "bitch" behind her back andtries to take advantage of her and her mom to give him rides... and this is a direct quote "When is that bitch and her mom going to get here"... and not only that, but when I confronted him, he goes "Oh no, I don't talk like that to her if she's there"... the stuck up asshole. He is a *touch* ::rolls eyes:: spoiled... as well.   Hmm... what else was I going to say... I don't know. If I remember, I'll be back.  Mood - happy, tired...
