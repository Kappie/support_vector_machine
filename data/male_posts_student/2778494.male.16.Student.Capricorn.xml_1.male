It was around 8:30 or somethin like that. Then we left my house to see my brother in SC. I read my book on the way down there and finished it on the way back. That sorta passed the time by. That night was probably the boringestist night ever! My brother took me to this dirt track race where his boss was racing. Im not saying Sean is a redneck because he's not, but dudes that think they are rednecks need to check this place i went to out. There were women that had facial hair sittin on top of pickups drinkin' beer, and there was a whole race of white men wearing dixie outfitter shirts. I felt so out of place.   //My brother and I sat in the pit along with some friends of his, and we got to experience the race in.... well, a louder way. There was like ten different classes in which the cars raced in, and his boss raced last. I think we walked in the house around 2:45 on Sunday morning. I was awakened by stepdad who stayed at home and babysat the previous night. It was like 8 somethin. We didnt leave for another 5 hours.   //I had read about 150 pages these past two days. Before this summer, it was a rarity that i picked up a book and sat for more than 20 minutes with it.  The Five People You Meet in Heaven  is a great little book that i will probably read again and again. I would recommend this book to anyone who feels they need to know that their life is for a purpose. I liked it a lot and would give it five out of five stars. I picked up the Potter 5 book tonight and started reading it again.  //Need some rest. I am signing off for the night. ------
