So I'm posting not.  I met one of my geekhood idols today. Steve Wozniak. The Woz. He gave the intro at today's geek camp plenary speaker, Kevin Mitnick. Mitnick, considered the most wanted hacker of all time, talked to us on internet security and "social engineering." He's paid his dues and his fugitive life is behind him, so he tells us never to do what he did. To summarize, he said, "Don't do what I did, and this is how I did it." And he explains how he did it. So go figure. The whole social engineering thing is amazing, instead of a hacker cracking a network, it is much easier and less trackable to call an emplyee of the target company and trick them into giving you their password. Genius how hacker's apply this.  But back to Woz. I heard him speak, but didn't see him after that. Only the "alumni" were allowed to go up and see the speakers after the plenary. So Tall Paul and I went to lunch with some others. Afterwards we walked back to the hotel. We were in the valet area, and looking at all the cars. Now keep in mind that this hotel is NICE, so all the cars are like convertibles, Ferrari's, BMW's and such. So then we saw this Toyota Prius. We thought, 'that seems kinda out of place' (keep in mind, a Prius is an awesome car, but it wasn't the norm BMW). We walked by it and did a double take: it was the Woz sitting in the driver's seat. It was breathtaking. We talked to Woz, got to take pictures, and then even Mitnick showed up. They were driving to Las Vegas together for Defcon. Very cool.  I'll post pictures later, but for now it's time for dinner.
