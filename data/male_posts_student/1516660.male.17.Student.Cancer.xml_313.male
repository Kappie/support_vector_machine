Today is the first day of the mass lecture. The 1st hour is Assembly with Mr Tham. O.O What a weird Thamy Tham Tham cat. Yes! After that is a long long peiod of break. We orignally planned to play games, but in the end, did not. I spent the time studying Mole Concept. Hmmm. Quite easy la, but I need time to understand.   After that were 2 lectures. Chem, followed by Maths. Hmmm. I learnt something new in Maths. AP, that chapter. Hmm. Quite easy, actually. Chem lecture was just intro to the subject and all.  After the two lectures, we decided to go to Bukit Panjang Plaza to eat. Me, Janet, WQ, Gloria, CQ, Josephine and her two friends. Hmm. I was damn hungry man. I wanted to eat at the food court, settle it there and then. That WQ don't want, and we ended up eating at KFC. Sigh. Hmm. When we are going back to attend make-up Maths lecture, it rained. Rainy rainy rain. I have to shelter WQ. Yes.  Hmm. Make-up lecture for Maths (Partial Fractions) is quite easy. Yep. So is Chem, because I read up on CQ's notes before. Hmm. I think I've got the basics spot on. Yep. That's good.  Hmmm. After that was campfire. We have to wait for awhile. I mean, a long while. It was raining outside, so in the end, they decided to carry out the cmapfire in the hall. Hmmm. They mostly did song-singing and some games. O.O! Even the songs are nice. Yes! Me and CQ had fun.HaHa. We danced the PJ song at the end. CQ refused to let me be the 'girl'! Hmp! :P   After that, me, CQ, WQ, Gloria, Janet and TZ went to Lot 1 to eat lor. I didn't have money, so I have to borrow some for Gloria. I brought Ice Kacang to eat. So damn hungry. After that, we took the MRT home. This time, me, Gloria and Janet took the bus home instead of walking.   Hmm. I reached back at 10+. Survivor Recap is showing. EE. I don't really like recap, so after bathing, I went online lor. Wah...I just came back from watching First Cut: The New Home. A ghost movie lor. So scary! I don't dare to go to sleep now...or even go out later. Never mind, don't go out lor. :P  Ahh well. I gotta go now. It's actually 1.10am when I am finished. Due to continuity issues, I am changing the time. Yes! Ahh yes. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
