I came over to wake her up but ended up falling asleep too... at 7PM.  I didn't wake up till 7AM this morning.  That's weird when you usually only sleep 8 hours or less.  I had my usual this morning, and egg with soft yolk and toast.  Mmmmm....  Brooke came to work with me till 1PM and we've been working up a storm.  First we worked on a website we created for my aunt.  She is selling her house.  It's called  urlLink  .  We added all the details and Brooke added the title and background.  Then we had to extract some audio off of a video we taped from the church.  I had to download like 3 programs and a decoder to get it to work but now I have an Audio CD of the service.  I have a list of about 20 other things I have to do so I'd better get to work.  Tonight we are setting up lights for the pastor's daughter's wedding like we did ours.  Oh, and tomorrow I have a meeting at DMACC with an advisor about starting school this fall!!!
