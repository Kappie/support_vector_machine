     
      The question has been asked many times before, and answered differently just as many times. A true friend is defined differently by different people based on their beliefs and values.  To me, a true friend is someone who will stand by you through anything, even if they disagree with what you're doing there in the first place. A friend is someone who will try to protect you when you refuse to protect yourself. A friend will take your abuse time and time again and forgive you every single time. A friend will let you go when you say you need to go explore the world alone, and will reply with a simple: "I love you and will be waiting here for your return". A true friend would take a bullet for you on a seconds notice.  That is what a friend is to me. And I would die for almost every one i know. Don't doubt it for a second.
