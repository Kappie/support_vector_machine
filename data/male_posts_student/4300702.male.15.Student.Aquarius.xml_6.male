Ever have that feeling that you just believe it's a dream? Like you sort of think your in some sort of shock?? I felt like that for a couple hours when I got to work. I don't know what caused it, maybe it was the constant calling between my father, mother, and brother on  how the hell I would get to work in 10 minutes . Well, my brother was supposed to drive me at  3:30 , and wasn't even home at  3:45 , so I called my dad to come drive me, and then my brother showed up 10 minutes before I had to work. I was only a little panicked, lol. Amazingly it only took 9 minutes to get there, with all the  weaving  and  high speeds  we were hitting :D       The Bad    Okay, later on in the shift, it was only about 130 people ( it was a world tournament for John Deer ) and I just felt like  crap . I think I was just grumpy, cause I felt so bad for some reason, it wore off after my break, which I spent NOT eating with  3 other adults , oh the conversation was  greeeeaaaaat .       So between the bad and the drunk, the  HUGE  storm tonight brought in a  black out  for a couple seconds. I was in the back eating half of a desert I nabbed from a co-worker, then boom, everything was  PITCH BLACK . Then the lights went back on, and we all smelled  GAS ! We thought something was leaking, but it was the ovens expelling the last gas from the flames. Oh well, everything was good after Chef Carl yelled  "SOMEONE TOUCHED ME!"  just a second after the lights came on.       Now.. The Drunk    This was surely the   highlight   of my night. Well most the tables have left now, except two, and it was around 9-9:30. So the end table had a couple of guys in it, which who have had a " couple " drinks. Considering the mess of beer bottles, and the 1 1/2 bottles of wine they finished off by  themselves . There was one  REALLY  wasted guy, and someone brought a kid in. They were giving away a miniature version of their lawn mowers as toys for the people's children, and there was one on display that wasn't given away. So a man took it down for his son to jump on, so the drunk guy got on it (to test it apparently), and started driving it around. Yeah, by the way this guy drove a  KIDS TOY , he really didn't need to drive home. Anyway, he was driving it around, with me and Will staring at him, since we were the only ones of the floor (damnit). So he runs over a kids toe, then, runs  INTO  a table, and  KEEPS GOING , the leg collapses, and we have to  lift the table  off this guy. Then he falls off the car thinger, and takes like 2 minutes to get back on his feet. Then he did the peace  Nixon style  and persisted to congratulate himself on his accomplishment.        Part 2:     He then got another beer, and started talking to us, saying how good we were on the  PGA TOUR , me Mike ( my manager ), and Romi, just stared weirdly, and ignored him. He then shouted, " I WONDER IF THEY CAN DRINK ON THE PGA??!? ". Then he stumbled into the main hallway, talking to mike. He then called Mike K, a  fucker , and handed Mike P a  golf ball , and  winked  at him, and said " He'd be waiting ". Then, I found out after I was done my shift, that  he stole my co-workers umbrella .       .....What a crazy day.
