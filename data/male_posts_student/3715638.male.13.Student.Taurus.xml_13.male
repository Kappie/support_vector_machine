I have swim team is a little while and I still haven't had diner yet. I'm hoping that its Hometowne Hotdogs, that place is awsume. I have nothing to do and nothing really to say today, its just really boring.    My life is rated PG-13.  What is your life rated?   I'm taking quizes again, I guess. Theres really nothing else to do right now. No one is on, of course. I barely see anyone that doesn't go to camp or anything like that. Of course, I'm taking them on Quizilla, except for that one, I don't know where that one comes from.
