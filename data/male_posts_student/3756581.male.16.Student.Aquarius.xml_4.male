We had to try and pursuade our audiance into agreeing with us, so I chose a topic that I felt VERY strong about...Saying the Pledge of ALlegiance in School. Another reason I chose this topic is because my english teacher is a raving, ranting, foam at the mouth, dye in the wool, Liberal/borderline Socialist and she believes ANYTHING that might make you proud to be an American is automatically EVIL because that is exactly what America is to her...evil. So anyway, I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it.  The Pledge of Allegiance  The Pledge of Allegiance, it certainly has been in the news alot lately, but not for the reasons I'd like it to be. As of late, a certain group from the Left has been trying to take the Pledge out of every aspect of life: The work place, resturaunts, but most importantly, schools. I can think of no better time to start having DHS students say the Pledge of Allegiance during school. It isn't about just saying it anymore. You have to feel it. It's about pride for your country, its about pride for all the freedoms we have and its about support for the people who protect those freedoms with their lives.  I was sitting at home one day, flipping through the channals, as I'm sure many of you have done before, when I came to FoxNews. I paused for a moment to watch one of the greatest men in news; Bill O'Rielly. He was talking about an Athiest father who was offended by the Pledge because of 2 little words...Under God. He said he didn't want his daughter to be teased because of her Athiest beliefs. After this story hit the news...all HELL broke loose. You had the Liberals sayiing that we should be "compassionate about the girls beliefs, and do away with the Pledge in all schools everywhere. Alright, I can go along with this whole "compassion" thing. If we must show compassion to an athiest, shouldn't we also have to show compassion to a christian? Are you kidding...Liberals HATE everything America was built on! So therefore, they hate Christianity. Ever hear of the ACLU...that doesnt stand for American Civil Liberties Union, it stands for  ANTI-CHRISTIAN Liberties Union.  Other than being a source of pride for Americans, the Pledge has many more purposes. It is also a source of remembrance of what this country stands for and what it was built on: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. There is another way to say this quote, and it goes a little something like this: Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Liberals who threaten them! Good one huh? I thought so. Anyway, I would like to see the young adults of Douglas Wyoming have that sence of Pride, that sence of "compassion" for other people. There are people who are trying to take those away, and we must stop them.  Now I will tell you how I plan to enact this in to our school. Some of the students today will tell you that their plans will cost "X" amount of dollars, well, folks, saying the pledge once a day, once a week, or even once a month is free, you can't put a price tag on Pride. My plan is very simple, all we need is the cooperation of the students in our school. There will be some who don't want to stand and say the Pledge, and by all means that is there right. I'm not going to force them to say it. If they believe that America is the Evil, Imperialistic country the Leftist Media tells them it is then don't pledge to it I guess. Its a minute and a half everyday, every week, or every month, I think they'll live. All we have to do, is have somebody, a principal, a vice principal, somebody in authority, get on the intercom and say "Please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. It isn't rocket science people.  In conclusion, all I'm asking is that we say the Pledge of Allegiance once or twice a month. This isnt difficult, and it doesnt have to be mandatory. All I want is for America's youth to be proud of being just that...America's youth. I want them to know that they live in the best country in the world, better then France, better then Germany, better then Great Britain. Some people will say "If thats true why does the whole world hate us???!!!" The answer to that question is very simple, they hate us because they want to BE us. What I want you to do right now is ask yourself once thing, do you want your children to grow up to hate the country that allows them to hate it in the first place?Is saying the pledge everday going to sway them from doing so? Possibly. Is it going to cause them to love everything this country stands for and believes in? Perhaps. In the end the pledge is one of the greatest pieces of literature ever written and also one of the most moving. It's simple and to the point, it doesn't beat around the bush, the author just went right to the point of things, and I think America should do the same.
