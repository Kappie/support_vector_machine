I don’t know what made me get so blinking angry that morning during assembly. It goes something like this:  Somehow that morning, I was very peeved because I had to walk all the way to the scout den, which is at one end of the school, when my duty area was at the front gate, which was at another end of the school. A senior had sent me to get the watchman to get the gate open, and I was given the honour to wake the guy up. Anyways, that’s beside the point.  The point is, when I got back, then only does that senior tell me I was on flag duty, and that I’d better look for the Head Prefect because he’ll probably be pissed at me for not doing it. Off I go looking for the HP. Soon as I find him, as expected, he screws me upside down for not doing flag duty. OK. That’s the end of the problem.  The thing is, for some reason or the other, I didn’t think that was the end of anything. I got extremely hot. And he’s still screwing me sometime later when it’s time to raise the school flag. I get even more pissed.  After HQ, I see that a few cadets are missing from the Guard of Honour line. Temper reaches boiling point. And what do I do? Ohh, nothing much. As the HP and several cadets were standing right in front of me, I slid my bag off my shoulder, threw it as hard as I could to the ground, took my bottle flung it away and starting swearing while putting on a savage face. Whether the HP saw me or heard me or not, I wasn’t really bothered that time. Hell, I wouldn’t have given a rat’s piss even if it was Sultan Azlan Shah himself standing right there.  I was in a bad mood for the entire morning, shrugging off friends who tried to approach me. Went up all the way to recess. Barely uttered a word for almost three hours. Must’ve set a new record for frowning.  Is it any surprise I didn’t pass first batch? Well, actually, if truth be told (and I don’t mean any disrespect to the guys who got first batch – coz I respect the pants out of those guys), the ones who got it were the timid ones. The yes-men. If that’s what those guys are looking for, then I’m probably the wrong guy for it, because I’m all for speaking up. Something like Shahrir Samad in UMNO, butmind you, I hate that guy.  Maybe I’ve just become the person I’ve been avoiding to become ever since I joined the debate team. I remember telling myself every single debater I knew was arrogant. I remember I could never get along with any debaters last time, because I hated them and they felt they were too good for everything else. Maybe I’ve become that. But if I have, then I’m glad at least I realize that fact. It’s time for self-discovery. (ß hahaha).  It’s time for me to feel my inner me. (ß What the hell am I talking about here?)  Well, time to sign off now.   The Hulk
