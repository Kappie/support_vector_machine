They had been downtown since like 2 and so they weren't up for more wandering so we just sat.  It was pretty good.  Miss Pangborn, who meghan said they had seen twice already that day, walked by and stopped to say hey and ask how summer has been so far.  That was cool cause she was one of my favorite teachers, and the one I'd most like the pass on the street.  Then the 4 of us started toward the Movies to see Stepford Wives.  On the way we stopped into Gift Adventure and sadly Meghan unknowingly lost her sunglasses while... having some fun... with a big stuffed Polar Bear.  We then left for the Theator.  We got there kind of early so bought our tickets and went into an empty room.  It took like 10 minutes to choose seats cause no one really cared where we sat.  Just as we sat Steph and Hazi came in, saw us, and sat in the row infront of us.  It was a pretty good movie.  Funny and I liked it.  After we decided to eat at Brothers Pizza, but found out it was closed so went to Chili's.  Pretty great food.  And so then we waited for parents.  I'd have to say it was a pretty fun night.  There are lot of movie coming out this summer, so we'll have to go see some.  If you want to see a movie let me know I'll be home most the summer until the end of July and parts of August.  You'd better like movies cause I'll be in touch and we are going to see tons of great movie.  Well I had fun...  -Dan V
