I could have eggs every day for months before i got bored with them. Especially on sundays.  give me a good diner with a cute old waitress who always has a fresh pot of coffee, and the sunday globe, and i'm a happy camper.  so I was very excited to find  urlLink Mr. Breakfast .  they've got recipes, and reviews of restaurants and breakfast lore.  they even rate restaurants not only based on food and price, but on how frequently they refill your coffee.
