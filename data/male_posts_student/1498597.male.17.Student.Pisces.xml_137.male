Actually, I shouldn't really be on bloggin' and I certainly don't have the time...but who am I to deny the public the truth!?  Anyway, today was (and still is) a very busy day.  I have tons of shit on my agenda that I just gotta get done!  Lets see...a lot of interestin' things happened today.  First, school.  Here's how the day went for me...It starts with our usual meetin' at the usual place and our usual mornin' talk before we all skip happily to our classes.  Then its first period in  Briski's  class,  World Cultures Honors , which happens to be one of my favorite subjects.  We watched a movie on  blitzkrieg  and other things that happened in  World War II .  Second period was  Algebra II   Mrs. Pizzifred .  She really isn't so bad, but she, like many people, can be A HUGE BITCH!  Anyway, I haven't been payin' attention to lessons this week and have done assignments partially or not at all.  On to break, which was the usual talk about lessons learned, lessons that might be learned...basically a re-cap/prediction of the day's events.  Next is third, with  Mrs. Bartholomew's   Pre-AP English  class.  She isn't such a bad teacher either, but has her moments where I loathe her.  Today we had a  district prompt  that I actually enjoyed!  I even managed to complain about the prompt itself and to discuss about society, authority, and stereotyping.  It was great!  Next was  Krick's Chemsitry  class, which I have with  Eddie, Elizabeth, and Naoki   (Josh H.)  and which I find to be a very interestin' class.  I mean, fuck, chemistry!  Its just fuckin' kick ass and amazin'!  We had a borin' lecture though, but  Naoki and I  had fun sketchin' up  VG parody pictures .  Next was lunch, with the usual talk and a casual game of  Monkey Bowling .  I won both games today, so here's what I've gotta say...HA HA HA HA, I kicked yer fuckin' asses bitches!  Anyway, after that was over, I went off to  Mrs. Schiessel's Spanish 2  class, where I had a semi-difficult test!  Sixth period had to be the fuckin' worst and I havta say that that was not the way I really would have preferred to end my day.  Sixth is  track  with  Coach Jacobsmyer  or  Coach J , the name we so affectionately dubbed him.  Actually, he is nice, but he is still (and these are my exact words) a STUPID, FAT ASS, SLAVE DRIVIN' BITCH!  Even though his post was taken by  Krick  today, we still had to run a track workout...and thats bad enough.  But no, we had to run in the fuckin' hot, scorchin' weather!  Well, I'm gonna try and forget how much of a  Nazi   Coach J  is.  The rest of the day I hung with  Eddie .  We went to  Islands , which I strongly recommend if you like seriously good food at a reasonable and affordable price!  Then we went to the  Corona Public Library  for a  book discussion .  We joined  Nick, Elyse, and Elizabeth  along with  Milano Cookie Lady  ( Kathrin , a library worker with a quite witty and amusin' voice) and discussed a book called  Monster .  After droppin'  Eddie  off,  my sisters  and I went to run a couple of errands.  Which then leads to now, or well now "now" is "then" and well...I havta go and work on my  Author Project Poster  about  George Orwell ...More to come!
