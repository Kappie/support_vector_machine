I have to finish a lit book by Monday, write a G.P. essay on the analysis of sex versus sexuality education, do an economics essay on the factors which affect demand, about 15 pages of the economics T.Y.S., plan for a Tamil essay exam, study for an economics and G.P. test and read up for my geogeraphy.  I pray thou be my strength oh Lord.  You wanna hear another ridiculous ACJC tale? I went to school today- A SATURDAY, for a 2hr geog lecture in the morning. This was followed by a 2.5hr bass sectional practice and a 6hr choir practice from 12 to 6. Great if you've got no life outside school. I mean, music is a very big part of my being and all, but commandeering my Saturdays? That's low man..  Have been speaking to this girl in school. Her name's Dawn. She's pretty and smart. Good to talk to. Her writing's in a book with Des. She holds Zhiying in high regard. She's nice. It's good to finally meet intellectuals who I can have a real conversation with. Thank goodness for Leon. I have to go do my reading now. I've waited for Des to come online, but she's not. No matter.  Have a happy day.
