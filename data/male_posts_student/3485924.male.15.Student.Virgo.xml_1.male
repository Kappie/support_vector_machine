Contrary to popular belief, I actually don't live here.  Yes, I live in good ol Ashburn, VA.  After a not too tasty 6 hour drive, we finally arrived here (we being me and my family).  For the first time ever I'm not dying of boredom after 10 minutes here.  They have wireless internet, and we were able to set up my sis's computer here ^_^.  This means that I'll actually get to enjoy being in New Jersey for the first time in years.  I got to talk to my friends a little earlier when I was on.  That was fun.  It turns out that they betrayed poor old me and went running without me ;_;.  I'm not too sad, because as long as I get to listen about what happened, I'm happy ^^.  Turns out that Sahil didn't do too well on his first run (too bad I wasn't there, I would have made him look better ^^;).  Let's just hope that both me and him get better at this "running" thing so we can do cross country and track next year.  Yeah, so like I was saying... wait... what was I saying?  Oh well, I bet it wasn't important or it was probably nonexistant.  Okay, I guess I'll see you all later.  I'm gonna publish this thing and go edit my profile or something.    (>^_^)^ /goodbye
