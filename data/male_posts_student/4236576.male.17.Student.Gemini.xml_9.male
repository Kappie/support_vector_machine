After a few months of WONDERFUL relationship, I made the biggest mistake of my life.. I cheated on her. For 7 months after that day, life has been HELL for Us. After my lies, and her insecurity, we fell apart. Here we are 10 months, 2 days and 20 hours. Stuck in a position we wish we weren't. See in the last 6 days, we have gone on 6 wonderful dates, done things we should of done, and fixed things that were messed up my mistakes. Now, things are looking up, except my daily reminders of what I did wrong in the past. See, I put nothing above this girl, but to her, she feels that it's an act. I stick up for her, try to help her with her problems, not once ever ask for anything from her, give her me, day and night. My daily reminders of the past, the constant nagging from every1 about me being a cheater, nobody trusts me, and nomatter how hard I try, nobody will listen to me. I feel like a left out soul, an apple gone bad, a waste of peoples time, I see people and now wonder what bad things they think of me. People who do things soo horrible get more respect than me. Drug dealers, alcohics, chronic cheaters, chronic liars, BAD PEOPLE. Ever feel like your labeled wrong? ever feel that you did something by mistake? even though my mistakes were indeed mine, is that really who I am? or did I just have a bad spot in my life? Is that even possible? Can you go on living a wonderful life and have a few ugly months of your life where you go bad? where you do some wrong? Why don't people believe in change? I truely have changed back to myself, the caring loving guy that she fell in love with, but nobody will listen to my story, well thats what people think it is, they think its a story to cover up what I did, and to save my dignity. NO it's not, I just have this anger for all the people who have done that, and that doesnt make me any different, people dont believe in exceptions. This girl has stayed with me through thick and thin, been there all the time, but her patience grew thin, and now I feel that there is nothing left of her but the evil stains I left on her. I love this girl. She isn't a girl to me, she is everything to me, at times, I didn't believe so, but I believe what matters most is that I do now and that won't change. I don't want people to trust me, I want to have to earn that, but All I ask for a litlle hope in me. They say that if you have hope and faith in people, they can change and if your hope and faith is shown, it helps that person. Well all I get is put down, ridiculed, picked on, rubbed in my face that I once was a cheater. Yes, they say once a cheater, alwayz a cheater, but then again, is that alwayz true? There is a chance that one out of a million people could be purple, theres a chance that wars would end, and yes there is a chance that the impossible is possible. I don't know who I am anymore, but I know I am not who people say I am, I am proud of what I am. And I will not be known as a cheater, liar or anything that I'm not. To some I was known as the sweetest guy, a sensitive guy, and a perfect guy. I'm not here to complain, im here to tell you about my dilema, my problem that the world will not believe in that miracle, that one in a million, and I know that things cant be proven in 7 days, but if im not given the chance to show myself, then my life can be seriously turned in the wrong direction. I have done wrong, on several occasions, I can say that, but I can say that I have done things that none of you boyfriends have ever done, I'm not saying a date evens out cheating on her, but things I have done for love are original, true and so mesmerizing, that I have given advice to some about this. I just want a chance, a chance to be known, a chance to be seen, and chance to be myself, for people to sit back and say, damn, I knew he wasnt a bad kid, I can truely say, with my bad actions and my bad reputation, I have not made one friend, in fact, I've lost most of my friends because of it,  because im not trusted around people. I'm pleading for a chance, a chance to prove myself, I know that the past wont disappear but, if people keep thinking of the past over the present, how can they move on? Where are all the optimistic people in the world? Am  I just blessed with a bad rep and a surrounding of Pesimistic people or am I truely cursed with a bad rep for ever? Is it possible to change your life without moving or changing the people your around? I'm in love with a girl that doesnt know me, a girl who just knows that I can be a good guy but is constently reminded that I'm a cheater. If people dont stop rubbing it in, how can I change? Can true love have a flaw?  everything  has flaws. right? Nobody is perfect, but some people like this girl, come pretty damn close. Im asking for a chance, this is my plee
