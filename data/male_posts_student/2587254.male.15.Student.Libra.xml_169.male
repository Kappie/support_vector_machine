Biology if you haven't caught on. So yeah down with that...and now I'm studying for math =P.  For the rest of the day after exams, I pretty much did my volunteer hours of cleaning instruments. Fun times haha. Kelsey and Niki were there also, and they did trumpets while I cleaned trombones for the majority of the time. Went out to Subway for lunch, came back and cleaned some more and then headed home.  Yup...that was pretty much exam day one. Tomorrow: Math exam. And then I gotta practice my audition piece like hell for Wednesday and Thursday.  Anyways yeah I'm out for now. Probably studyin' for math for majority of day. Later.
