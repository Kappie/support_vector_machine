His new description was this: "This is for Michael: Continuing to be an ass isn't going to help you any. My patience runs thin and I'm running on hypocracy. Therefore, I can be an ass, and you cannot. Do not push me."   Marten, I'm not speaking to you anymore. Just because you think you are "Marten the Great" or the "Pirate King" doesn't mean that you are. Also the fact is you left. You're no longer the "leader". You can't claim that title  because you left . I'm dropping it as of now, so if BlogWar II: Electric Boogaloo drags on any longer, ladies and gentlemen of the blog, I believe that you will know who is responsible.
