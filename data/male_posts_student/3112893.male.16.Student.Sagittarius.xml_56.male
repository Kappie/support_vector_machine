February 2nd, 2004  Just Another Day  It's just another (It's just another day) It's just another (It's just another day) It's just another day--When people wake from dreams  With voices in their ears--That will not go away 	-- Oingo Boingo  "Yeah, it's kinda like that"  So ends another day in the same old fashion. Mom's looking for a job, I'm listening to music, writing my 'blog, surfing the net, talking to people i.e. Being unproductive. The whole of the day wasn't much different. Instead of playing SC, I played civ2 today. It wasn't bad and was, in fact, kinda fun. But it still stopped me from doing something better with my time all the same.  Anyway, mom wanted us to all go for a walk today and I didn't really want to go but in the end decided to go with her and my sister. My mom tried to convince me to buy a Jamba Juice, but knowing our financial situation, I decided against it so she tried to convince me "to feel ok buying one" by calling my dad and having him tell me that we had the funds, or that even if we didn't that I should feel fine getting it anyway. MY dad didn't say that and as usual my mom's plans backfired and ended up making me look reasonable (Which I was). But he did say that if I wanted it, I should get it.  So once we got that done with, Javaneh decides that she's gonna throw an insult my way and maybe be funny or something but I didn't think it was funny and replied with something sharp and quick-witted, which my mom didn't appreciate because it kinda hit her too. So my mom walked back home and shouted "I'm leaving! I'm leaving! I'm going home! I can't take this!" so Javaneh and I tried to get her to come back but she wouldn't come back. We did, however, get her to stop at the corner of Beverly and Charleville and talk about possible places to go and hang out if she didn't like being at home. But we came to the conclusion that not only did our finances allow us to do something like that, but there wasn't anywhere that we really wanted to go anyway.  Once we were home I started playing games after doing a few small things like eating and sitting on my bed and the like. I've been playing for most of the time since then :-( I hate it when that happens. In any event, not much happened. Mom still looked for jobs and I didn't talk to anyone or anything. Javaneh watched TV and we found out that our apartment has a plumbing problem. Whatever goes in the garbage disposal shoots out of the shower drain. That sucks... a lot. And so ends the majority of meowMix's day. It's the same ol' same ol' thing if you know what I mean. 	>>meowMix  February 2nd, 2004  Ya know what I mean?  This is regarding Shannon and me, how I wish we connected better and understood each other's different life-styles better.  It seems to me that Shannon doesn't know exactly what I mean... Every time I see her she's mad at me when I leave even after I've told her how hard it is to get any time with her. I think I get what she means when she says that I should just disregard my family and do what 'I' want, but maybe that's just an illusion and I don't really understand her frame of mind.  I talked to Peggy about this and she said that she understood the situation but didn't know what to do about it. She said that Shannon's never had a family so she doesn't understand what it means to have family or the pressures that come with it. I told Peggy about how the only time I tell Shannon about my family is when I'm mad at them and that her perception of them is probably off and perhaps is leading to her lack of respect for them. As you can tell, I had told her about how Shannon never really says thanks to people who give her some kinda service.  Anyway, I just feel bad now because I love Shannon and I'm near-certain she still loves me but I don't know how to show her anymore because it just always feels like I'm never doing enough. I want her to feel loved but I need to feel loved in return to a certain extent. I miss what we had before Jordan. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to place blame but it just feels different now. Maybe we've just grown up and the shallow things that we would use to express our care for one another don't mean anything anymore because we're passed it. Maybe we've just grown out of it and we're a stronger bond, but maybe I'm just dreaming. I wish there was something I could do to make her feel the same way for me as she used to. And I wish I could do the same for me.  I miss the tingle, the little nuances, and the excited, non-paranoid, doubtful Shannon. I think I'm just reminiscing on old times. I don't know but I know that I love her and I want her to know that. 	>>meowMix  That concludes this installment of and the series 'Blast From The Past'. I hope you enjoyed it. Actually, I could give a rat's ass is if most of you enjoyed it. I only hope a few certain people did and I hope that no one reasonable was offended by what was said.  That is all. -- Feanor
