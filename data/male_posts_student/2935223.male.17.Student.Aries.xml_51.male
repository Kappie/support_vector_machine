Except I'm not a dork, I'm sumthing else...I'm the crazy hybrid dork thing!!!    This is hilarious:    you know what's ALWAYS bothered me? cold cereal mascots    I mean that is just some FUCKED UP SHIT    the Trix rabbit, for example    I dunno man... if I were him I'd be fucking KILLING some kids    I remember a commercial where the fuckin rabbit WENT INTO A FUCKIN STORE AND BOUGHT A BOX OF TRIX WITH HIS OWN FUCKIN MONEY.    fuckin kids came outta NOWHERE and basically fuckin mug the poor stupid bitch rabbit    "silly rabbit Trix are for kids"    Fuckin rabbit just sits there and looks depressed.    FUCK NO that wouldn't fly with me    I'd have pimp-slapped EVERY ONE OF those fuckin bitches    and made them go get me the REST of a "complete breakfast" and eat Trix right in front of them bitches and THEN beat the shit out of them some more.     and wtf is with the disguises? All the dumb rabbit does is hide his ears and all of a sudden he's a fuckin kid?    I dunno about you, but if I SAW a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap, I wouldn't immediately think    "Hey, there's a cool lookin human kid, let me go over and share some of my cereal with him"    NO.    I'd be thinking    "that's a 6 foot fuckin RABBIT with his ears tucked under a baseball cap... what the FUCK was I just smoking?"    another thing... wtf is up with cereal being "A part of this complete breakfast"    last time -I- checked, cereal WAS breakfast    they show a big ass bowl of frosted flakes next to a waffle, a pancake, toast, a banana, a fuckin grapefruit... who the FUCK eats a breakfast that big    not me    I don't even EAT breakfast nomore    I mean, I eat when I get up    but the whole thought "BREAKFAST IS ONLY SERVED UNTIL SUCH AND SUCH TIME"    bitch, you make my fucking sausage and egg sandwich when I pay you the fucking money    don't give me that shit.    Back to stupid cereal mascots...    Lucky Charms.    FUCKING LUCKY CHARMS    Lucky can turn the fucking MOON into a marshmallow, and he can't escape a bunch of fucking 6 year olds?!?!?    C'mon now, Lucky.    I KNOW your bitch ass has got to have a "Blow the fucking kids up" spell SOMEWHERE    or make "kid marshamllows" and EAT those bitches.    "They're after me Lucky Charms!"    ....    KILL THEM, BITCH!    I dunno why I went off on this rant here    it's just always bothered me." Tell me that's not the greates rant ever?!?!?!  Carly reintroduced me to vgcats and bash.org...  I need a personal night tonight, for the last month or so, I've never really had a night to just sit home and do nothing*nothing including video games and T.V. watchin'*  Dave is a stud....just thought I would say that...I mean, seriously, sum of you might not even know how awesome he is, if you don't know Dave, get to know him, and ladies, he's single...I think, it's hard to tell these days 'cause he's such a FRICKIN' STUD!!!  Ya, I might be a good person, but I think I am an embarassment to men all over the world.  So, after school, Dave, Whitney, Keli, Brittany, Rachel, Ervin, and Myself, all were in the Lounge....then eventually everyone left until it was just me and Keli. So, I'm in a darkened room with the most beautiful girl in the world*not to mention the fact that she's my girlfriend* and what do I do??  I sit in the corner!  I'm such a loser...I didn't even try to get close to her.   THEN, the other night, I showed up at her house at like 9 and didn't leave until like 10, and all I did was sit and talk with her, which is just fine with me...but...GAH!!!  As soon as I get back in the car, Steve asks "So, get any??" Now STEVE is a true man, he is the prime example of a man, that boy has his mind in his pants at all times. Of course I answered no, which I was pleased with.  But man, hugging Keli is the best feeling in the world....there is seriosuly nothing better.    I've been learning sum pretty messed up stuff in Psychology lately...like about this guy named Freud...who had sum pretty messed up but awesome outlooks on the Id, Ego, and Superego and dreaming and stuff.....enough about that, I'll tell you later if you ask.  One of the weirder things I learned in that class is that we spend just about 25% of our nights *cough*....aroused.  Not just guys either, both sexes are this way.  PLUS the fact that it doesn't have to be seuxally related either, just whenever we enter REM sleep our bodies become.....aroused.   I don't know why this is so weird to me...or why it is so funny to say the word....aroused. gehehehehehe.  I'm a loser.  I'm just gonna go....now.....before I say any more stuff that could make me hate me more....... Peace Out YO!!!  Spense
