I steered with my knees and wrote childish scribble, against the linear system suggested by Mead, forging sentences and paragraphs in a fashion similar to Texas legislature redistricting.  I don't know if it's healthy to write letters to someone I haven't dated in over two years; this often happens once a semester, towards the end, where I take stock of my situation and decide to let her know, write a letter that describes more of our break-up (for those who don't know, I broke up with her without giving her a reason, one of my shittiest displays to this day), produce honest-thought rhetoric that is taken the wrong way, and we get into an email war, rectify the situation, and then she wants to be friends and keep talking like we used to, and I shut off conversation again until the next semester ends.    The nugget that got the ball started was a fine epistle to obviousness -  I wouldn't be where I am today if we were still together.   And I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for her.    I think I got bored, and I hate to say it, because she was great fun.  Maybe it became too easy; we spent the summer of 2000 with nary a sour word or sour face exchanged.  Maybe her exile to Denton for the fall while I was in Shreveport was too much; it hadn't been before though, which means I was just tired.  Whatever happened, I lost interest quickly and completely, something I still don't understand, and something I still haven't forgiven myself for.  How do you forgive yourself for breaking the heart of the one person you've cared more for than anyone else?    Driving through Houston tonight, I was bored.  Matt Bowden took me through the Montrose district, past Rice, and through the Galleria.  When I was 15, I went to Kansas City on a school trip and was fascinated by its glamorous, cosmopolitan downtown area.  I remember when we shopped the square downtown (it's got some funny regal name), and I ran up and down the stairs in this outdoor arcade, filling my lungs with the air of consumption, blown away by the possibilities of city life.  Houston is bigger, the architecture is more impressive, and the amount of shopping is massive.  Yet I sat in the car, chin tucked into the palm of my hand, almost begging to be inspired.  Nothing happened.  It might be because I'm older, and once you see your first Pottery Barn, you're just disappointed the next time.  It might be because I have no one to share it with...there was someone I wanted to share Kansas City with (imagine how excited that girl would be to know we were going to Kansas City!  Everything's up to date in Kansas City!), and I could imagine her there.  Or maybe I understand my economic situation, see my staggering debt, and realize that the Ray Lynch CD I bought today is probably the last splurge until July.    I'm not comparing Katie to Houston...I've never really enjoyed Houston, save a few coffee shops near Rice University.  Maybe I am comparing Katie and Houston, even though I truly enjoyed Katie, save a few petty instances.  I do know that, save the Astros game on Saturday and the hours of Grand Theft Auto, I didn't really enjoy Houston all too much.  And I don't know whose fault that is.
