All I can remember about that is that I was dreaming that I was in another place entirely and that I wasn't supposed to be, so I snuck back to my room. Weird though, I can't remember the other place anyways.   My fingers are all soft and stuff and they keep on slipping on the keyes making it quite hard to type without making a typo. Stupid typo bunnies! *Smashes them* sdfghasdf h...I missed; darn.  Anyways, I am bored. So for sure now, Dominique is coming with us to my Nana's and Papa's on Friday. It's gonna be fun. My mom, Chris, Dominique and I are all going up on Friday afternoon and Derek (maybe Amy; his girlfriend) and my dad are coming Saturday. Saturday is their actual anniversary. *Is so excited* I get to see my cousins! Wahoo!  And I'm done. I will be talking to all of you later. Have a great day and a fun time at school. Bleh, I'm bored. Get on AIM if you want to talk. I'll be on for another 45 minutes.  "Bridgekeeper: Stop. Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.

Sir Lancelot: To seek the Holy Grail.  Bridgekeeper: What... is your favourite colour?  Sir Lancelot: Blue.  Bridgekeeper: Go on. Off you go.  Sir Lancelot: Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Sir Robin: That's easy.  Bridgekeeper: Stop. Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.  Sir Robin: Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper. I'm not afraid.  Bridgekeeper: What... is your name?  Sir Robin: Sir Robin of Camelot.  Bridgekeeper: What... is your quest?  Sir Robin: To seek the Holy Grail.  Bridgekeeper: What... is the capital of Assyria?  [pause]  Sir Robin: I don't know that.  [he is thrown over the edge into the volcano]  Sir Robin: Auuuuuuuugh.  Bridgekeeper: Stop. What... is your name?  Galahad: Sir Galahad of Camelot.  Bridgekeeper: What... is your quest?  Galahad: I seek the Grail.  Bridgekeeper: What... is your favourite colour?  Galahad: Blue. No, yel...

Bridgekeeper: What... is your quest?  King Arthur: To seek the Holy Grail.  Bridgekeeper: What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?  King Arthur: What do you mean? An African or European swallow?  Bridgekeeper: Huh? I... I don't know that.  [he is thrown over]  Bridgekeeper: Auuuuuuuugh.  Sir Bedevere: How do know so much about swallows?  King Arthur: Well, you have to know these things when you're a king, you know." --Monty Python and the Holy Grail
