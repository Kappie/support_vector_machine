    
       So, in Christchurch today. All my plans for the city have fallen through due to bad weather and lack of tourists. For example, Kayaking/Rafting trips are all off today due to lack of interest. I'll just have to limit myself to shopping (I never buy anything besides books) and walking.

Techie guy here in the cafe just broke my memory stick (the memory for my digital camera) so I'll have to convince him to let me onto the administration computer. Be back in a bit.
