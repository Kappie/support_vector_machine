Two civil rights groups filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority from randomly inspecting passengers' bags, saying it's an unconstitutional violation of personal privacy.    It would seem that the search is defined as a term of service, just as you are required to wear a shirt or shoes in a store.  You are free not to wear said articles, but then the store is not required to srvice you.  If the MTBA hasn't already done so, they need to get this condition printed upon the tickets or posted in a way to be clear to the consumer.  Just like airlines require a search as a term of the flight, the transit people can and should do the same.  I just don't see a problem here.  No one's rights are being violated if the terms of the contract are established up front.
