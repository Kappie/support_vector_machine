Your perfect smile, your matchless face!   But then I saw, You looking back at me!    Can you see? with your eyes so keen?   Or your heart, so full and free?    Arise! Arise!   And look into my eyes!   See my life, see my love!   And see my heart, reaching out!    Can you see? with your eyes so keen?   Or your heart, so full and free?    Now take my hand, and with me stand!   In your eyes, I've found new life   In your heart, I've found new love!    Arise! Arise!   And look into my eyes!   See my life, see my love!   And see my heart, reaching out!    To you
