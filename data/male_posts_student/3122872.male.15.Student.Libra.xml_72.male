Or in Jamie's case "**** off" but of course stick it on e-mail and its the best thing since sliced bread...  Yeah, I know, I need a life...  Anyway, I got Hell Week in 10 days  Thursday - Maths Challenge Friday - Rest Saturday - Chess Tournament  Sunday - Concert Monday - Music lesson at 6:30 Tuesday - Music exam Wednesday - Easter concert rehearsal Thursday - Easter Concert  :/ *sigh*
