February marked many things. It marked the beginning of the Quidditch season. And it marked... well, it marked the beginning of a lot of things.           Cheryl had gradually gotten used to seeing Kiw multiple times a day. She had grown to be more rule-abiding, pulling her socks up (in both the literal and metaphorical sense), paying attention during classes, keeping her fringe short. Her friends, however, were slightly more unfortunate.           “But sir, it’s so hot to tuck in our shirts  completely !” Rachel said innocently, staring at the Man with the Mole. Sunny was finding it rather difficult to keep her feelings inside though, and tried to put on a forced smile while stuffing her shirt in angrily.           “It tarnishes the school’s image. Do you understand that?” he said waspishly.           “As if we care,” Sunny muttered under her breath.           Unfortunately for her, Kiw heard.           “Oh yes you do,” he said, dangerously close to her. She could see the beads of oil on his greasy nose. “Or at least, you will when I’m done with you,” he continued. “Ten points from Griffindoor, and a detention. Ten o’ clock tonight. Be punctual.” With that, he stalked off.           Sunny stared sourly at his retreating figure. Rachel patted her on the shoulder. No words, no vulgarities could ever properly describe the lump of poo that was Kiw.           “What lesson do we have now, anyway?” Rachel asked, trying to change the subject.           Sunny thought for a moment, before clapping a hand on her mouth. “Crap! It’s Defense Against the Dark Arts!”           They grabbed their bags, and ran.  ----------           Five minutes later, Sunny and Rachel stood, panting, outside their classroom. They had run like the wind (actually, no, more like a slow breeze) but had still turned up late. Hesitating at the door, they peeped inside the classroom and saw Kiw already droning on to their classmates. Yihui, the nearest to the door, breathed a sigh of relief when she saw them at the doorway. Glancing at Kiw to see if he had seen her not listening, she whispered, “He’s not in a good mood today. Stupid idiot. Anyway, I thought you two had died or something!”           “Actually, my dear,” Kiw called out from the centre of the classroom, “I had told them to go and make themselves presentable. I have never seen two people who have been such incorrigible rule-breakers. Both of you, sit down. And I seem to remember saying that I do not condone talking in my lessons unless I ask you to.  Silencio .”           Yihui opened her mouth to retaliate, but the spell had already done its work – she had an invisible gag over her mouth. Resigned to fate, she slumped back into her chair and crossed her arms, making a face at Kiw. But he didn’t notice. He was busy sending the class back into a stupor.  ----------  The fifth-years were practising Banishing Charms in the bright sunlight that filled their Charms classroom. Mr. Teo, who was in a rather good mood today, went around humming an old melody, helping those who had trouble with the spell.           “Remember,  concentrate  on Banishing the cushions! And also that nice wrist movement we’ve been practising!”           “Er... the swish and flick?” Muthu said absent-mindedly, as he performed the movement. His cushion, instead of flying away from him, flew up into the air where it hovered for a few seconds, before coming down to fall on his head. The result looked quite like a girl with a pink hat on.           Mr. Teo hurried over and corrected him.           “You know, I think Professor Huda’s really on maternity leave,” Matt suddenly piped up, as he Banished another cushion into the box they were supposed to be aiming at.           Hu Ping stared up at him. “That’s stupid. Maybe she’s just sick or something.”           “But the conversation I overheard! It’s too...  fishy ,” Matt finished lamely. Mr. Teo, who was at Cheryl’s table, turned to look at him for a moment, before he turned back to the girls again.           “What’re you guys talking about?” Yi Fan cut in from the other corner. As he turned he also unconsciously performed the wrist movement they had just learnt, and sent a cushion flying right into Hu Ping’s face.           “Oh... about Professor Huda,” Matt answered, trying not to laugh at the sight of Hu Ping, who had now thrown the pillow off and was sending a few colourful curses at Yi Fan.           “Ah,” Yi Fan said, faking a look of mock awe on his face. “Eh anyway, care to help me with this spell? I just can’t do it,” he said wryly.           “Really?” Hu Ping asked.           “Just look and see,” Yi Fan replied. Turning to his pile of cushions (they all looked in bad condition due to various dirt stains from the floor and walls), he tried to Banish a cushion, but only succeeded in getting it off the table and falling to the floor.           “ Accio cushion !” Matt said, and the cushion flew back up again. He swept the dust off it and placed it back on the pile in front of Yi Fan. “You’re not concentrating properly. Just think of Banishing the cushion. Don’t think of anything else.”           Yi Fan looked doubtful.           “Go on, try it,” Hu Ping cajoled.           Yi Fan scrunched up his face in concentration. “Okay, here we go!” With one fluid motion, he pointed his wand at the five cushions in front of him.           Matt gasped.           “What?” Yi Fan asked, opening his eyes.           For answer Matt pointed to the box on the opposite side of the room. In the box, Yi Fan’s five cushions were stacked neatly, one on top of the other.  ----------  “You’re so good!” Cheryl enthused as the class spilt out of their Charms classroom. Mr. Teo had been so pleased with Yi Fan at the end that he had given him a large block of chocolate. Of course, the chocolate was now making its rounds among the fifth-years.           “Yeah... but I didn’t think I could do it...” Yi Fan said, still quite surprised at himself.           “You just didn’t know you had it in you,” Matt added in.           There was a pause.           “So now you’re gonna beat me at Charms!” Barnabas wailed.           They rolled their eyes, and walked on. And for the first time this year, Yi Fan could see a shred of hope for his studies right in front of him.           ----------  As Cheryl entered the Great Hall for dinner, she saw from afar the figure of Ang Yee Tien – that girl who had been bothering her and her friends day after day. After Yee Tien had been appointed as one of Molekiw’s (Wo)men, she had become even more obnoxious, taking every opportunity to deduct points from Griffindoor for small trifles such as having a speck of dirt on their uniform. Still, Cheryl thought Matt was getting it the worst. Yee Tien was deducting points from Griffindoor simply because she disliked him.           “She’s coming,” Eunice said to the rest.           In a matter of a few seconds Yee Tien had strode up the length of the Hall and now stood in front of Cheryl and her friends.           “What do you want?” Matt said rudely.           “How about deducting more points?” she replied, sneering.           “Because we don’t like you,” said Liqin, who was at Yee Tien’s side.           “Oh, you actually can talk? You look so bimbotic, I thought you couldn’t,” Matt replied.           Liqin paused. “What’s ‘bimbotic’?”           Cheryl had to pretend to cough into a tissue to disguise her snort.           “Oh, it means you’re very pretty,” Eunice said, making her voice as saccharine-sweet as possible.                          Liqin paused again. It seemed she had to take a few seconds to digest anything said to her that was more than a few words long.           “Anyway,  you  don’t talk to her like that, okay,” Yee Tien smirked. “Five points from Griffindoor. I’m  so  sorry. And  you  better watch out,” she aimed her stare directly at Matt, who deliberately started walking towards her, before elaborately stepping past her and going to the Griffindoor table, where he turned and stared coldly back at her.           “Stare you out,” he said coolly.           “I’m not gonna waste my time on a little boy like you,” Yee Tien answered snidely, before whipping round and walking off.           “She’s got an attitude, that one,” Matt said later as his friends sat down. He was helping himself to a large serving of baked potatoes.           “As do you,” Eunice said playfully.           Matt’s temper seemed to have gone down a bit, and he managed a grin.           “Sorry for interrupting,” a voice behind them said. “But would any of you like to try out for the Quidditch team?”           They all turned round to see Desmond Yap, the present Griffindoor team captain and their senior in sixth-year. Sunny and Eunice, both Chasers in the team, waved cheerfully to him. His grey eyes flickered to them for a moment as he smiled. He then looked at the others up and down, his gaze resting on Rachel for a moment.           “Nah, I can’t, I’m commentating this year,” Matt piped up from his corner. He was now on his second serving of Shepherd's pie.           Hu Ping’s mouth fell open. “Really?”           Matt stopped shovelling the potato pie into his mouth for a moment and looked up. “Well, yeah,” he shrugged. “I got through the auditions.”           While the rest clapped and laughed, Hu Ping said again, “Really? But I thought your commentating sucked!”           A round of poking and cursing ensued once again. Desmond raised his eyebrows. “Erm... so... anyone?”           “Me!” Muthu called out.           “And me... ouch!” yelled Hu Ping, who was still being punished for his insolence by Matt.          “Yeah, I’ll go for it,” Cheryl said.           The girls all turned to look at her. “I didn’t know you liked Quidditch so much,” Minyu said. “Actually I’d join... but then the robes aren’t orange!”           Desmond looked oddly at Minyu. “Well, we’re thinking of re-designing the robes this year,” he said.           Minyu pondered over it for a moment. “Nah, I’m not good,” she said finally.           “Well, anyway, the three of you,” Desmond said, his eyes trained on the three who had just signed up (Matt had stopped poking Hu Ping and had gone back to his Shepherd’s pie), “tryouts are tomorrow, 6 o’ clock at the pitch. Got it?”           They all nodded, and he took his leave, moving on to a group of chattering third-years next to them.           “How about you, Rachel?” Sunny asked playfully. “You had this...  lovelorn  look in your eyes...” she turned and took a hard look at her captain’s lean frame, his shock of carefully-spiked hair, and smiled. “Find him handsome, maybe?” she pressed on.           Rachel stared at her friend angrily. “Go eat your dinner!” she said in a commanding tone.           “Anyway, if she joined the team all she’d do is stand at the goalposts and fumble with the ball when it’s thrown to her,” Matt said, sticking his tongue out. “Anyway, Cheryl, why’d you join?”           “Well... I just thought I’d try it out, that’s all...” she said vaguely.           Actually, Cheryl’s mind was buzzing. She had just signed up for Quidditch tryouts. It’d been a long time since she’d done something so offhand, so on-the-spur-of-the-moment. She felt giddily happy. She was trying out for the sport which her idol took part in. She could almost see Harry Potter, flying like a hawk...           And she saw herself, soaring on a broomstick...           Suddenly she stopped. A thought had just occurred to her.           She didn’t have a broomstick.
