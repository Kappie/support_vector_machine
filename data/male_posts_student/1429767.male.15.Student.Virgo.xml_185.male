He asked me why I wasn't there today so I told him that I couldn't find a way to Kentucky he's like that sucks! Then I heard just a little while ago that Krissy told him about the fight with her ex and he hugged her and gave her a kiss on the cheek so I'm a little jealous but I'm more interested in details about the fight and such. So Krissy I'll give you a hug *hugs*! I hope you are feeling better right now I really want to hear about it if you want to talk about it so yeah... Email me since I'm at Josh's right now... Jackie left a really good comment about the "Old Friends" post. It made me think a lot about the old days again... She's right you didn't have to worry about what people thought because everyone thought you were cool back then, you could be yourself and not have to worry about any cliques that wouldn't like you or what have you. You can still do that today if you try hard enough, I think. You can be yourself and not care what other people thing or what cliques think about you. If you do that though you wont have any friends unless you can find a group that likes you for who you are and become friends with them. So I guess thats all you can do is just be yourself and not worry about being popular and just go with whoever likes you for who you are. I guess that really didn't make much sense but I tried... I hate it when I think of a good thing to write about then loose my complete thoughts on it and end up with a mess of words that don't make sense... Meh, I guess I just like to blabber... I found some good quotes from firehot tonight, so I'll post them down at the bottom. Im kind of down tonight for some reason it's just another low is all I'll be back up soon I hope because you all know it sucks to be down and not know why you are... I keep thinking about things that I know I shouldn't and I'm guessing the lack of sleep isn't helping out too much. Man I hope I can sleep tonight!
