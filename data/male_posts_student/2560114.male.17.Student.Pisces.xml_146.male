Mr. Garcia should make tests easier so all of the kidz in his class dont fail...hopefully he grades ours very kindly. Vball practice was aiiiight i guess, i had to run like 56 lines which was suppper gay but scrimmagin was fun, cuz it gives us a chance to work on a few things in our rotations. Yeah well i need to make a family crest for english and then i need to study for spanish and algebra...later dayz.
