Im gonna miss those times a lot now. cus a part of the group is gone. . . . . . . a part of US is gone. and its not the school that we miss, we can always visit it again, it's the people that made that school so much better. i think u all know who i mean in particular. or at least most of you do. lets c wat i got for graduation : a cd player ( thank you mommy and daddy!) and $50 from ma aunt and uncle. thank you guys too. you think id b happy but im not. not to sound unappreciative,  but id rather just have a time  machine if its alright with you
