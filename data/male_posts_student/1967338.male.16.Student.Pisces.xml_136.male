Plus, then I found the perfect actually attainable girl and asked her out.  We have absolutely everything in common.  She's even a Babylon 5 fan!  What more could I want?  It actually makes the break seem like a bad thing, just cause it's a time during which we wont see each other when we normally would.     Her friends are always trying to get her a boyfriend, and now that she's found a guy who likes her without their help they won't leave us alone, so we're keeping it a secret at LN, just to spite them.  There's my love life update, hope it doesn't bore you to much. Michael: Why were you calling Erin non-jewish?  It seems like sort of a bizarre insult. Jonah: If this is a web-comic, I know Erin's the insane beauty(Oasis, Margaret, sort of Gwynn, Sal), Lara's the wishy-washy younger sister who only shows up occasionally (Min, Lilly, I know there are more), and Marten's the brilliant, but mysterious blonde (Riff, Fooker, Roger).  So who's the hapless Nerd who gets caught up in everything?  And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.
