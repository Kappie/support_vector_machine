So here is my lightbulb:  -----  Setting: Primitive, but not medeival. This is a fantasy story, but there's none of that magic or dragon riding stuff. The known world is mainly encircled by a vast unexplored region that flows from rivers to mountains to lush forests. In the world exists scattered villages and only a few large cities... but outside and around civilization exists hordes of vicious and violent beasts- every area must first be cleansed of these creatures before anyone can settles down safely. This is why the first colonized city is also the largest; people didn't like to leave it. Travelling is dangerous, since the only places safe from a beast's bite are those which have been populated. Roads aren't exactly teeming with creatures looking for blood, but all the lesser-used paths are danger zones. Anywhere that hasn't been mapped has probably never been lived in long.  Bageanti- The largest city, founded by Turg Basanti six hundred years ago as the first true colony within the wilderness. It is bustling with science and technology; life is good and the people seem happy. There is a lack of space because of buildings steadily moving in towards the heart of the city. This is due to a rising rate of encounter with foul beasts on the city's edge. So within, it is crowded but busy. Stores abound and life remains mostly unchanged. On the outer limits, however, the sky is hazy and the homeless litter the gutters and ditches along the roads and sides of buildings. The air reeks of urine and cheap alcohol (but mostly urine). Not a very nice place to be.  The poorer folk who live homeless aren't exactly looked down upon by the more fortunate. They are just ignored, left alone to rot. The leaders of Bageanti want the city to appear immaculate. They don't want its dirty side to be shown. There's nothing really to hide besides that. The people are working towards the general betterment of mankind. Most realize the hypocrisy of their ways, but know that if they start to change things word would get out that the situation exists. There is a weekly "cleansing" of the inner city, where the restless bums who had snuck into the inner limits are forcibly taken back to their assigned area. Some of the wealthy actually help the less fortunate, but laws are laws.  Most of the homeless are viciously torn apart by the beasts on the outer limits. They have no protection or shelter, so it is easy for those animals to get at them.  The renowned Dr. Makaveli Craus lives here.  Arlaoa- The second largest city within this world. It's people accept technology and often trade with the neighboring towns and villages. It is fairly big, but not nearly as gigantic or as vertical as Bageanti. Still, it is a city compared to the smaller villages. Beasts don't usually show up around its area, but encounters do occur every so often. This is probably the place least touched by the effects of wilderness.  Every once in a while messengers will come from Bageanti to Arlaoa with a new technology, whether it be a new form of entertainment, medicine, or transportation. It is very rare for a traveller from Arlaoa to head in the direction of Bageanti, and even rarer for them to return.  Arlaoa has recently been receiving strange transmissions that spooked all who heard it. Garbled signals on radio that pierced the listeners' ears and drilled strange religious and symbolic ideas into their minds. The memory of those messages is almost impossible to shake. It first occurred within the town square, caught by the largest communication tower, thus being experienced by the general public. In a panic, the leader of the city cut off power to that section of the city and had the radio station changed. He keeps a receiver within his office walls that records the transmissions as they come in. Experts have been trying to decrypt them since he realized how grave their epistles were.  The signal was rumored to have caused hallucinations.  The main industries of Arlaoa are manufacturing and trade.  Ilios- A town on a peninsula, surrounded by many islands. It seems tropical in this world, but by Earth's standards it is not. Warm, but not exactly mediterranean, this is a vacation hotspot for those that can afford the expensive equipment and supplies needed for a journey through the wilderness.  The beaches here are separated into three groups: safe, risky, and forbidden. Safe, obviously, is the most popular tourist choice. Risky is subjective to the day and the tides. Sometimes it is calm and beautiful, sometimes it is extremely dangerous because of strong waves and currents. These are open to the public when resort owners know it is safe, but sudden changes in water level have been known to occur. Thus most people prefer the safe beaches. Forbidden areas are the places in which beast encounters have been known to occur- and marine creatures are among the worst. The general public are not allowed near these coasts.  The islands and the mainland have little contact with each other, mainly due to the risky water travelling. Only a handful of boats have a guarantee of not being destroyed by marine animals.  This is a small town which seems much larger because of the resorts and hotels. Still, most people do not have the money for vacation in this world.  Dreaum, Joyeuse, and Hadriin- The three smallest villages within this world. Each is led by a village chief.  Dreaum is self-contained. Its people don't often go out to meet others, and as a result, its knowledge of the outside world is limited. It's a dirty place with an even dirtier history. A hideout for bandits and other outlaws. The people here don't exactly take kindly to newcomers or strangers.  Joyeuse is a relatively neutral place. Its people are content, its crops healthy. A nice place to live.  In the past there was a scare in Joyeuse where young children were wandering away from home and disappearing. It started three years ago and didn't end for seven months. The children were never recovered, and the chief declared it an incident caused by beasts. Everyone knew he was wrong.  Hadriin is where the story starts. Rune, the main character, lives here. He has lived in this village for twelve years, brought here by a woman who was most likely his mother. She left him in the care of the village chief, but he ended up being raised mostly by a midwife and an old man named Rudrin. Mmm, enough about him. I have to save something for the character section.  This place is peaceful, but it knows past woes. Forty nine years ago a raid on the village left most of it burned down. Many died, souls of friends were lost. Some of the remains of that event are still visible. The culprits were never caught, so the search was eventually given up.  A place where everyone knows everyone else and life is as good as it gets without technology. Many books that hold years of information litter the hallways of every home. Family trees are dated way back to the Hadriin trail- when those who had chosen a simpler life migrated from Bageanti and Arlaoa to the three lesser villages in hopes of a freedom from science and the constant stressful search for technology and new uses for it. The people have not forgotten technology, but they choose to limit their use of it- thereby allowing themselves to be free of its constant use and temptation.  ----  Characters:  Rune- The main character. He is a young man whose exact age is unknown. Currently living in the village of Hadriin, he was brought here twelve years ago by a woman who was supposedly his mother. Not quite an amnesiac, he remembers he once lived in a very big city when he was younger. Possessing a bad memory and prone to spasms of zoning out, everyone around him can tell there is something wrong in his head. Skilled with a bow and arrow, he often joins hunts to bring the village food. He has good aim but an unsteady hand, leading to many last-second misses on smaller animals.  Raised by an elderly midwife, Margarite, and an aging man named Rudrin.  Mysterious woman- Rune's alleged mother. She came carrying the boy into the village twelve years ago, handing him to the village chief in hopes of a better life. Her eyes were filled with tears; dark circles showed she had not slept for many nights.  She stayed in Hadriin for only a week with her child before leaving without a word.  Rudrin- A wizened old man who arrived in Hadriin not long before Rune. No one has ever really inquired much about his past, as he is a kind and gentle man, providing humor when others are down. He took a liking to the young boy even as his mother still held him.  Possesses many books from all different eras. Trinkets and toys litter his home.  Spent more time raising Rune than anyone else. He is talented in that he is able to teach the boy things that stay with him for a long time; it was because of Rudrin that Rune is able to hunt at all with his shakey hands. Still, they are more friends than family.  Margarite- A kind midwife with a longing for children of her own, she was the foster mother of Rune for much of his life. She loves the boy as her own child, and he loves her back. Rune considers Margarite his mother, even though he remembers the voice of the woman who brought him to Hadriin.  Druminov- A drifter. He travels from town to town, constantly searching for something he does not know. Years of roaming the backroads and untamed paths have given him the experience and skill necessary to kill anything that crosses him- man and beast alike.  Yet for those who have met him, he seems an innocent fellow. He is usually resting in Dreaum when not out on the open road, leading to rumors that shadow him of deeds he may have done, crimes that he's committed. No truth has been confirmed in these tales... but none has been denied.  Dr. Makaveli Craus- A brilliant and renowned scientist who lives in the mega city of Bageanti. He is known the world over for such inventions and discoveries as the Skycruiser and Crop Harvester. A true friend to the people and planet.  Dr. Seibzhen- An infamous scientist who is known for his research and work on history and human evolution. Often brandished as a villain because of his mutilating human enhancement projects and experiments with cloning. A blight to the reputation of Bageanti and all of science itself. He was sent into exile in the untamed wilderness, stripped of all status and power. Staying near the outskirts of Bageanti, he was known as a madman to any and all who saw him; unkempt and constantly paranoid, he often wandered into the city as a shadow of his former self.  Disappeared when Dr. Craus rose to his current rank.  Kamalai (?)- A shadowy and strange figure who once appeared in Joyeuse. He claimed to be a hero working to find the lost children from three years ago, but has not been seen or heard from since.  Has recently been sighted near Hadriin.  -----  And so begins the story.
