I am at the point where things that I usually find horribly boring are now engaging and entertaining: for instance, I watched an entire soccer game on tv, as well as one of those espn documentarys about the 1968 steelers team or whatever. I have also read every profile on my "buddy list". And seen most of the democratc national convention.      Good news: the US Open series is on espn, and it gives me a couple good hours of tennis. Also, the daily show and late night tv (letterman then conan) are fantastic. I love walker texas ranger (but only when the clips are short and taken out of context.).
