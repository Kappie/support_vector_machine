I'm looking for practical advices  tips for starting up and maintaining small business. Some people might wonder why a teenager like me so interested in business - no, I don't study economics nor my father is a businessman either (although he do manage NGOs like a business).   I'm pretty much a very, very small (in term of capital) businessman doing web designs. Somebody always reminds me, start small, but think big. But how do I grow bigger when I don't have a single clue how to maintain this small business? So, have to ask  learn from an experienced sifoo.       PERLU DI INGAT  Apa yang penting di ingat: 1.	penyusunan dan pengurusan fail yang baik, update fail selalu memudahkan segala pengurusan kita dengan pelangan.      Even  urlLink Pak Wattan's  first rule I didn't comply. :P My client's info and project log are practically strewn all over the place - real bad... Good thing must be done at once so I quickly gather all the info and project log from those stick notes, diary and PDA. Then, just make a form in Microsoft Words and enter all the info and project log.  Haa... Only now I can clearly see what's going on with my project and how fast (or how slow) I've been going so far. Now I also could easily hand over the project to other people as all the project info and log is there. Real practical advice, thanks a lot  urlLink Pak Wattan !
