I went to the river for the rest of the time, but then on last sunday i got piss drunk and i mean piss drunk.  I got so drunk that i could not move, they had to get 3 19 year olds to lift me into a buggy and wheel me home.  When i got home they dumped me on my lawn and had to drag me inside...my mom had to help with this lol.  When I woke up i was on the couch in my garage...wow what an amazing night, i thought to myself i got home all alone no help i mustve had fun.  I go upstairs and my mom tells me the entire story HA HA.  Well this weekend i went to the beach, got to look at all the babes....oh wait what am i talking about it is still weekday, oh well i went to the beach anyways.  Tomorrow i have to get some hair cut off...shitty.  Then i get to go back to the beach and check out the chicks again....I love vancouver haha.  When i get home I will beat the game i have been playing for awhile..Farcry.  I still play ultima online quite often almost 24/7 but i still like to have my fun with 1st person shooters.  in UO i have been playing on my thief and my warrior lately, been having a little fun killing shit in dungeions, its still really awesome even though i am super rich lol.  Oh yeah happy canada day lol, i celebrated that too just completely slipped my mind right now.  I cannot wait to be ungrounded and to get home so i can do something productive with my life lol, like going down to the pirate lagoon (hangout at river).  Its awesome there i mean a fire, some water, could practically do anything...except if we got caught by the fire department it would be so dumb.  Well talk to you later  Chris  Talking to Robert Listening to: Growing on me by the darkness
