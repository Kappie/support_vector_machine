     
      Trying to get a list together and hopefully get at least some mild timeframes for Matt's last party as a free man (excepting of course the night before his fune..err, wedding).  Last conversations put the approximate date of the gathering near March 12th or March 19th. The two major venues I heard mention are Las Vegas and New Orleans. I'm mostly inclined to go with a majority view, but please be aware that not everyone who 'gets a voice' has access to this forum.  My personal vote - for both financial and lazy reasons - is New Orleans. With a good crowd, it's hard to beat the French Quarter and Uptown for drinks and tomfoolery.  Assuming we could get people to land in New Orleans at close to the same times (or a couple of times), I'm not opposed to providing transportation for the weekend.   I know golf courses and paintball facilities within 45 minutes of New Orleans.  Live music is everywhere.  I'm sure I can speak with a few friends to find the right gentleman's establishments for poor little engaged Matt.  Anyway, Vegas is also an option, I just have to do more research for it.   Thoughts, suggestions, gibberish...
