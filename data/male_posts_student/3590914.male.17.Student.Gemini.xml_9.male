It will probably include some cool stuff from  urlLink deviantart  (great art site, go waste a few hours there), megatokyo, and other random stuff. my sites all look like crap, but who cares?  yeah, so now onto all this make up work i have due in the last 2 days of school because of a goddamn sinus infection that won't go away. [insert scream here].
