On the front, it said something like, "In God's special timing, He brings you that one perfect soul to complete you." So now thanks to our popular culture's Jerry Maguire-esque myths, God has become a cosmic match-maker whose goal is to complete you with a soulmate. Poppycock. I think the purpose of male-female romantic relationships and the notion of love have been sorely distorted. Instead of joining another person in matrimony to sacrifice for and truly love them, we apparently are supposed to "find ourselves" and achieve "self-actualization" from our spouse.  The next morning I awoke early and decided to pass the time by reading another chapter of C.S. Lewis'  The Great Divorce . A section I read spoke directly on this issue. In one scene, a dwarf ghost is momentarily reunited in heaven with his former earthly wife. She has received the gift of eternal life, but the ghost is trapped in his current dwarfish state due to his inability to let go of the Tragedian, a phantom he leads on a leash who symbolizes the dwarf ghost's inability to love and experience joy. The dwarf is upset that his former wife seems unwilling to reciprocate his desperation for her to "complete" him. Well, she no longer needs to play those games because she has been completed by Christ. Here's part of the exchange, in which the Tragedian is attempting to keep the dwarf ghost in his miserable state (it helps to realize that the dwarf ghost and Tragedian are one-and-the-same):   "Love!" said the Tragedian striking his forehead with his hand: then, a few notes deeper, "Love! Do you know the meaning of the word?"   "How should I not?" said the Lady. "I am in love.  In  love, do you understand? Yes, now I love truly."   "You mean," said the Tragedian, "you mean -- you did  not  love me truly in the old days?"   "Only in a poor sort of way," she answered. "I have asked you to forgive me. There was a little real love in it. But what we called love down there [on earth] was mostly the craving to be loved. In the main I loved you for my own sake: because I needed you."   "And now!" said the Tragedian with a hackneyed gesture of despair. "Now, you need me no more?"   "But of course not!" said the Lady; and her smile made me wonder how both the phantoms could refrain from crying out with joy. "What needs could I have," she said, "now that I have all? I am full now, not empty. I am in Love Himself, not lonely. Strong, not weak. You shall be the same. Come and see. We shall have no  need  for one another now: we can begin to love truly."     That last line blows me away. To think, that in spite of today's "hooking-up"-obsessed-culture what we really need is for God to complete us, and only then "we can begin to love truly". Lewis, you were brilliant.
