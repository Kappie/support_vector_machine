What the hell is the point. Apart from disturbing people who wanted to spend the night in the dry watching a ppv movie.   wankers wankers wankers   KillerHurricanes: Do you mean an organised display of a bunch of 15 year olds letting them off in the street?   KillerHurricanes: Neither oddly enough. Its a neighbour a street away. They seem to have a firework display for the opening of a bag of crisps.   They've just let off about 40 (I kid you not) identical shells one after another. Oh, as I type the second barrage is going off.   They seem to do it every couple of months all year round. KillerHurricanes: It's like Baghdad around here at present.   the heavy rain is obviously not putting them off. (must be the lack of cable tv!)   Sounds like WW3 here. Why don't they sod off?
