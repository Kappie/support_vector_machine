On Mick's newest CD he still had his voice, but I would guess they cost $150+ to see in concert, which is ridiculous.  Anyway, Britt called me tonight from Myrtle Beach.  He's coming home monday and we will probably do something every day next week.  He was on the way home from the House of Blues.  They had a teen night which he said was incredibly lame so he left.  However, he wants me and some other people to go to Wild Bill's on a sunday night, and if you know me, you know I am not a club-type person.  But knowing how I am, I'll probably end up getting dragged into it.  The main reason I don't wanna go is because I don't wanna hear 2+ hours of shitty music.  It's like Blair said the other night..."Why do people listen to shitty music?"  I guess because they like it, and if they like it, then they're usually not worth talking to.  Anyway, I talked to Britt for about an hour and we're gonna play golf this week maybe, so if we do, it should be fun and I should kick his ass again. :-) I just wanna shoot a 2-digit number and I'll be fine!  Hopefully this time we won't get paired up with 2 meanass old men.  Thank God those dickheads left 4 holes into our round last time.  It sucks when you start talking to somebody again and then they have to leave for like a week.  Uggh, I miss you. Hahaha, yeah.  So this weekend I have zero plans for July 4th other than to hang out here at home because everybody is gone until next week.  Alright, I'm gonna shut up now.
