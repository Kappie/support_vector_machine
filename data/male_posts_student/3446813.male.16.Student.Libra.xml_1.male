Though the constant interaction with little kids keeps me awake, i guess its the principle of the thing...or something. though this is unrelated, i've noticed im flat broke and i need more money to survive. heh, though my little excursions with friends to tapioca express and what not dont help the situation at all.  well i'd keep chatting but i have a math test to study for and a lab to do and yes, they are all important, cuz they are both for classes i wish to get a higher grade in, so everything counts.   peace out, a-town  ps did you notice that i didnt give a crap about capitalizing and punctuation and junk, like i did in the first entry? i told you it would happen  well, peace out, thunderclap   HEY!
