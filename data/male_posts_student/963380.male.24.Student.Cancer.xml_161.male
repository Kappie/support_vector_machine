With luck I'll never have to wear glasses again (they say I'll have to wear them for reading when I'm forty. To them I say BRING ON THE NANITES!!!).  I'm a little apprehensive, but it's starting to settle. Everyone I've talked to has said it is the greatest thing that has ever happened to them. I hope I can say the same in a week.
