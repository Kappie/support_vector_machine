The site was about a week old, and was very interesting. I read it, and was thoroughly convinced that an Oil Crash would occur in the next couple of years.  For whatever reason, I forgot about it. I don't know why I did, it just didn't seem so important. When I saw this movie, I remembered  urlLink lifeaftertheoilcrash.net , and revisited it, to find that it had grown incredibly. The author of the site now had a book out, which I will be purchasing as soon as possible. Go to the site. Now. Read it with an open mind.   I know that I'm only thirteen, but hear me out. This is important. Read it. If anyone is reading this, go to the site, and please take a few minutes to see what the author has to say.  Please.
