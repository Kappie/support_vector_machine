This study has been out there for more than a year now, but you probably haven't heard it about it through the major outlets.  What's wrong with the media policing themselves?  Or at least having an honest discussion about their own bias?    "Our results show a very significant liberal bias. All of the news outlets except FOX score to the left of the average member of congress."  All but three news media outlets (Drudge, ABC World News Tonight, and Special Report) were closer to the average Democrat in Congress than to the median member in the House of Representatives.  The average Journalist is less than half as likely to have voted for Bush as the average voter in and around Berkeley, California.  The average journalist is less than a third as likely to have voted for Bush as the average voter in and around Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Journalists' voting habits in 1992 are more than twice as unrepresentative of the public at large as the voting habits of the residents of the most conservative state in the union, Mississippi.  The news outlet with the scores closest to the median member of congress--hence the most CENTRIST news outlet, was the Drudge Report. CBS Evening News was furthest from the center.  The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, USA Today, and CBS Evening News each score closer to the score of the average Democrat in congress than they do to the median.  The New York Times score is twice as far from the congressional center as Fox News.  CBS Evening News scored closer to Senator Ted Kennedy than it did to Joe Biden.     Right now, someone is pushing a documentary striving to illustrate Fox News as a Right wing outfit.  The movie is being used heavily at Democratic fundraisers.  It's interesting that Fox has done several pieces reporting on this film, and asking the question 'does it have any truth to it'.  I've seen them do analysis on their own coverage while dissecting parts of the documentary.  Why doesn't the NYT or CBS do the same thing?  What's wrong with a little introspection?
