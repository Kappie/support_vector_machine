It would be inappropriate for me to try to write something witty and funny about some B-Movie, and I'm too close to the grief of my friend's condition to articulate my feelings in any coherent fashion. So I just thought I'd share something from my favorite birthday present,  urlLink Celtic Daily Prayer: Prayers and Readings From the Northumbria Community :  "All that I love into Your keeping All that I care for into Your care. Be with us by day, be with us by night; and as dark closes the eyelids with sleep, may I waken to the peace of a new day."
