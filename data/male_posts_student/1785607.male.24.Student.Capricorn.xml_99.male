Maybe. But that beautiful feeling; those chilly mornings; the excruciating anticipation a week prior to the 24th; snuggly sweaters; soft and silky drinks; being buried in a pile of blankets and quilts in a cold, cloudless night; family; love; memories...  The best time of Year. This will be one of the greatest years for Xmas. I'm expecting a lot of memories, a lot of moments, a lot of love and family.  I remember as a child those Friday nights in winter, in bed; my brother; a cup of hot cocoa with rainbow marshmallows; a hot plate of Campbell's chicken and rice, and a sandwich; watching The dukes of Hazzard and at the end the classical "Friday night, movie presentation", of which I never saw the end 'cause I usually fell asleep. Those were the days!  Now thanks to DVD, I'll get my "The Dukes of Hazzard: the complete first season" and remember those days... Xmas, what a feeling!    urlLink    ... urlLink
