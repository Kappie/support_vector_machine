Mother came back with chee cheong fun and I meowed at them. After that, I went to watch HZGG (taped from Sunday). Even Xiang Fei came back from the dead! How reviving! Meow moo meow!   After watching the touching HZGG, I went online, ate my lunch and went to play FFX. Can you believe that WQ was still sleeping until 12+? Meow.  Oh. I defeated that idiotic Seymour!! YAY!! I finally won him! That idiot double-casting freaky mage! Luckily Nuled every magic just in time! Even ducks can win him. I also defeated the Wendigo. How meowful. That was today early morning, when I played till 2am. HaHa. Today I just walked here and there to the Home of Al Bhed. I saved. Heh Heh. Even ducks used Fira on plants.  Okie. After playing FFX, I came online and meowed at XC and WQ. Meow moo meow! Okay. At 6, I went off to bath, then eat dinner. I came back online at 7.30. Ducks may meow and cats mat quack, but you can't stop penguins suciding.   Okie. I gotta go le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
