Started off with big plans of scaling Longs Peak, but unfortunately for the second consecutive summer, my "Colorado Summer" wishlist remains unchanged.  I will most likely play my first CSU Cricket match this weekend. Had a rather glorified nets session yesterday, but all-in-all, felt good to bowl with the red cherry after a long time, at full-tilt. Nothing like fast bowling, with the wind behind your back and the ball swinging sideways. Hopefully, I can unleash one of those swinging  "bewdies"  and knock some guys over later on in the big game. Yepp, high hopes, alrite! In the next net session, I plan to hone my batting skills and smell the leather myself (perfume balls?!).  Now, let me recommend a couple of good reads. The first is  "India Unbound"  by Gurucharan Das. Good book, if you want to be enlightened on India's  "Social and Economic Revolution from Independence to the Global Information Age" . Great read if you want to know the basic facts about the whole socio-economic situation of India of the past generations, as it touches on stuff like caste systems, democracy, capitalism, economic reforms and a whole slew of other things. It gets boring in the later stages at times, where I felt the author was getting a bit repetitive in putting forth some ideas. But, I believe it's a must read for Indians born in the present generation. Not only that, I  sincerely believe  they should introduce some of the text from the book -- if not the entire book -- in high school history books, and clear an otherwise distorted picture of some aspects of modern Indian history. The book is not only unbiased, but also seems to be based on extremely thoughtful and comprehensively-researched material, as expected from a Harvard educated person. The second book is  "One Two Three...Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science"  by George Gamow. I remember reading this book sometime during my 8th grade, I think, when my father tried to instill some Math and Science passion in me, after knowing about my horrifying grades in Math and Physics. It is good to get back to those days now. This book is undoubtedly a science classic. Those fun and learn sort of books, written at a time when physics with a dash of math was not considered to be as esoteric as it is today, what with philosophy coupled with metaphysics being the buzzwords. So, if you want to recreate and recollect those wonderous science moments in high school, here's your chance.  Before I wrap things up, as usual, an update on my  "progressive"  music front.  After all, a post that does not have anything to do with music, almost implausible, eh?. These days I am listening to bands like Rush and Yes, who epitomize progressive rock. There is an amazing complexity to prog rock, (like say science or math), that is really difficult to comprehend at first. Makes us realize that musically we are  so  immature. Prog rock was a style that combined rock, jazz, classical, psychedelic and literary elements and emerged in the late 60s and 70s with art/space rock bands like Pink Floyd, King Crimson, and Genesis. In a sense, progressive rock is something like hindustani classical music. The music typically features lengthy material, continuously evolving musical themes/concepts and liberal use of shifting time signatures as well as some wonderfully creative rhythm sections. I recently came across a quote that said:  "Complexity is best judged by musicians..." , and I don't think anybody can doubt that. Even as a novice bathroom guitarist, I now know too well why I am quickly falling in love with forms of music that go way beyond the three chord structure of pop and even classic rock to an extent. On the flip side, the most beautiful things in life are simple, so I won't be surprised if classic rock remains the staple diet in the future.
