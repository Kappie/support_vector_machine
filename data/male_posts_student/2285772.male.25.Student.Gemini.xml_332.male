       
      for my  intro to integrated studies  class, i'm writing a 10 page paper on mormon environmental ethics. i'm supposed to have all of my research finished for a presentation in my class tomorrow, but i can't get my stupid  urlLink gospelink  program to work. luckily, most of my paper is philosophical and the research is mostly a basis for the philosophy. hopefully, my professor will be understanding and will let me hold off 'til wednesday
