But that's just how i feel. All the family lives there, dad's family and mom's too, But there are the exceptions ( sorry the spelling) like: uncle in Italy, us, my aunts who lives in a neighbor city... and there they go. I have an uncle and aunt who are my uncle-parents,, it's kinda funny. My mom is sister of this aunt and dad is brother of this uncle, see?!!!! They like,, hummm...hung out together all 4 of them.  Who am i tring to cheat on? That was the boriest, you couldn't do anything that your brother or sister was there looking!!!!!!
