The only reason I'm not doing it is because I have some sort of mental disarray in which I always see the lazy side of things, I always say even "if I dont do blank blank blank, blank blank will happen, it wont be that bad." And so I have done today, although I REALLY don't think it will have THAT big of an effect on my life, I just told GPaul I'd be there and I didn't tell him I wasn't going. I hope GOD doesnt decide to give me yet another wake-up call by not trying out. But why would he, honestly, I didn't tryout as back up plan A although it would have been really the same because they were actually better than us at the time. But I stayed with our team and look where we end up. Beating the A team from said club, that I would have been on the B team of. So even if I don't make UNITED I can still play for LSA or Oldham County, assuming I make it. I would rather play UNITED than Ballard any day and if I make Ballard and not UNITED I will prolly quit altogether and I seriously will consider it even though soccer rules my world as it is known through my eyes.  It's really weird though, the story of not making Ballard. To be truthful without boasting or anything, I was nowhere near the worst player. A kid who had been on my MS team who I was indeed better than, made it but he did not play very much. I was VERY VERY pissed when I saw his name on the list. I thought HOW THE FUCK. Like if he had not made it I wouldn't have minded at all about getting cut...period. And I still didn't/don't really care. Another thing, is that all my friends from MS who were all a year behind me, playing Varsity MS soccer, although some probably could have, made their High School team, albeit freshman even though Alex was supposed to be on JV. And yea well we didn't have a Frosh team so theres your story. I HAVE SOMETHING I COULD SAY HERE BUT PEOPLE READ THIS SO I WONT SAY IT. Aaaaaaaaannnnnnnd I don't care if I make the team this year because I'm gonna have an ASSLOAD of schoolwork, with 2 count em 2 Eschool classes on top of my already NOT EASY class list. I dunno how I am to survive 10th grade playing soccer every freaking day. And Sam actually wants to make the team, so if he made it and I didn't I wouldnt give a fuck either because I just told you why.   So there's my soccer story/rant.
