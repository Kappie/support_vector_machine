When my only memories of you Are reveries of pain and sorrow,  I know now that you are gone and lonely days will follow. When I look at your picture on the wall With Confusion and uncertainty, I know that something went wrong With all that was meant for you and me. When all I can think about is how you left without a reason,  And how you don't remember me now Is nothing like the season Of love we had and how I cant deal with what I have to Live with forever... Is this The End?
