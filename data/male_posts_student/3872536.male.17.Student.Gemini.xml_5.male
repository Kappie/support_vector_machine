I ended up sleeping 4 almost the whole afternoon.  Then haf a chat on the phone wif kian beng, whereby we share the difficulties each faces. He's realli changed to be more matured in a way and has realli learned to treasure friendship. Haiz... Pple have realli changed man. Remember how crazy and childish we once were in sec school. That was realli the time I enjoy myself man. But everything must change as time flies. Perhaps I should realli be more matured and crap less ba. Dun realli noe wat others want mi to be at times. It's easy telling others to be wat they truely are but when it comes to myself, I'm rather confused at times.  Hmm.. More of self-reflections today. Duno wat to do wif my JCT. Dun think can finish studying.  Ok, that's all for today. Think there'll wun be anything interesting awaiting mi this holiday coz all attention will be put on the JCT.  Jia you to everyone out thr struggling...
