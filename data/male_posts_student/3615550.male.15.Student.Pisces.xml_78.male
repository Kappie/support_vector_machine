The transfer of power came two days early, in order to thwart the terrorists who would undoubtedly try to coordinate some attacks and "make a statement."    The situation in Iraq is still not perfect in my opinion.  However, I want to hear from you guys on this one.    Was it a good idea to transfer power two days early?  Was it a good idea to transfer power at all before Iraq can be reconstructed?  Can Iraq succeed, or will it flounder in radical Islam?  What do you think?
