Ya know, if you swallow pop rocks with Coke or any other soda, that it will make your stomach explode? Well, one of my friends was talking about it and I felt brave so I did it... I bought a pack of Pop Rocks (mmm... Strawberry) and a 1 litre of Dr. Pepper (Dr. Pepper is my form of crack.... Tasty, and legal) I put the whole pack in my mouth and took a big swig of the Dr. Pepper. The pop rocks popped all the way down my throat! It feels funny, but I'm not dead :) In all this I got 2 things.... A new favorite snack and 5 dollars! ;)
