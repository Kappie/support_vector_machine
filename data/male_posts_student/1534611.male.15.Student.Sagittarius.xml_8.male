I've been deep in thought about religion and after life the past few days. I think I've hit moments of mad depression thinking about these things a few days ago, but hopefully I'll be able to sort out all my thoughts, feelings and beliefs on the topic.  I'm not sure what triggered it, but whenever I goto bed I start to think about what happens after I die, do I just rot in the ground and have no capability to remember anything? I strongly believe in ghosts and spirits due to personal experiences with ghosts and what I believe to be my guardian angel, but still, I can't stop thinking "what if it's all just a crazy coincidence?" There have been times where someone with me at the time, experienced the same thing, but what if we just misunderstood what was going on or what was really there. Seems as if someone actually researched exactly what happened then theres always an explanation as to why we were lead to believe there was "something" there. Clearly if there are ghosts and spirits there is an after-life, and recently I've been questioning these memories of these "ghosts", I mean things happen all the time, but the second something odd happens, which could involve a ghost I automatically assume it's a spirit haunting me!  I was watching this show on CTV and I'm not sure what it was called, but it was about a woman (her name was beloma or something) that woke up from a coma after 16 years. She said there was an island where people in comas could talk to eachother. Beloma saw a picture of a lady and automatically noticed her as a friend from the island. Beloma spoke her name and talked about her, and the doctors were confused as to how she knew her, and a few of the doctors started questioning if such an island could exist. Beloma said this lady in the picture played tic-tac-toe with her in the sand and she drank beer alot, also learned details like how she had the state of texas tattoed on her ass. The doctors did some research on the woman in the picture and it turned out she had a daughter named Beloma a few years after the coma. OBVIOUSLY at this point everyone is starting believe that they actually did meet on this island. They met up with the lady in the picture and the lady said she didn't remember such an island, but there were a few odd things. She didn't know as to why she named her child Beloma, it just "stuck in her head" and she was from dallas, texas... and she had the state of texas tattoed on her buttocks, clearly Beloma had met her before, and this lady wanted to meet Beloma. When the woman met Beloma, Beloma recognized her immediatly, but the texas chick did not. After talking for a bit the texas chick remembered her, she remembered when Beloma was young she was lost on a beach and the texas chick went upto her and waited for Belomas older brother. The texas girl played tic tac toe in the sand with Beloma and talked to her about everything. Suddenly the possibility of this island existing faded away.  The entire purpose of me writing out what happened is because, even though there were so many obvious signs of there actually being an island where spirits went too when their bodies were in a coma. It was SO OBVIOUS that it existed, but there was an explanation for everything and this spirit world belief was destroyed. All that happened is Beloma's mind got mixed up and got the memories all wrong. I strongly believe I've had these "ghostly experiences" but what if my mind is just playing with me? My friends say they get de ja vu alot, but all it is, is when the brain is tired it processes things twice, so right after it happens you think about it again and it's blurry just like a dream, therefore you just assume it has happened before. It's all because of the brain mixing stuff up. If a person has brain damage, will the spirit also have brain damage? The only reason we exist and believe is because of our minds that allow us to think and function, without a brain how can we exist? how can we think? We can't.  I really hope there is some sort of after-life, but with alot of religions, the basis is that we have a soul that lives forever. But how can a soul think without a brain? If a soul is contained in a human body, what's the point of a brain if it can think of its own? This spirit thing seems way to perfect, unlike the human body. We can get hurt physically and our lives can be changed with a mallet to the head, but if we have a spirit why aren't we able to think as if we did before. It just doesn't make sense.  Religion in my mind is nothing but a nice story to make people less afraid of death. As I was thinking about this, I came to believe that thousands of years ago there were a few very smart people that made up religion to comfort other people. They must have known we all are afraid of death, so they made up stories about heaven and such things. As the years went by the story got more complex, to make people behave they created hell and then created God as the one who decides wether you're good or bad. Then one day some monk thought up a leader of hell, an angel that went evil and now tries to make people evil so they goto hell. And taa-daa! you have the basis of christianity. As the years went by it just got more complex, and then Jesus was born. As it happened long ago I cannot explain what happened to Jesus, maybe there might have been a group of people that tried to make God come alive, so since Jesus was a child they made him believe he was the mesiah. They got a few "actors" like the "blind man" to say he was blind, Jesus went to him and thought he cured him but in reality it was all staged. I also watched a documentary on the "ressurection" of Jesus that said there was a very popular drug/herb that made a person seem dead and that they would wake up several hours later. So they might have given Jesus the herb before he was crucified, and then Joseph quickly took him down from the cross before he woke up and put him in his "tomb". After Jesus' ressurection and death, too make things more easy these people which helped stage all of this created The Holy Bible which basicly writes down everything about god, heaven, hell, and the reason for all of this, Eternal-Life.  I'm not saying I believe this is exactly what happened to Jesus, infact I don't know what I believe. But the story which I said is an example of what could have happened. I truly want to be able to have a 100% belief of God, Jesus, Heaven, an after-life, but I simply can't, I've thought about it way too much and for me personally It just doesn't make sense. Religion is such a great escape from reality, Religion is NOT a bad thing. It makes people less afraid of death and the basis of alot of religions is basicly to Behave good and you'll be rewarded in the after-life. Essentially this seems perfect, if everyone in the world (I know I'm picking on christianity, I'm sorry) was christian, and followed all the commandments then the world would be perfect. The idea and morals of christianity are generally great, making the people which made christianity truly brilliant. If we all followed these rules, we would be in heaven as promised, a "heaven on earth".  Alot of people have their strong beliefs and sometimes I wonder to myself "How can they believe such a thing so strongly? There has to be a reason" and they sometimes rub off on me, sometimes I am certain there is a god, but there is never any proof. All I want is some proof of an after-life, some proof that one religion is true so I can follow the rules of whichever religion it is. I wanna be able to go face to face with a ghost and talked to him/her about it, maybe even get god himself to directly speak to me. I don't wanna pray and think he spoke to me, I know at that point it might be all mental. I wanna speak to a spirit and get a picture, some solid proof, a sign or anything. Maybe even just a drawing on my desk that ends up by my bed side. I strongly want to believe in an after-life, however I need proof, I want proof, otherwise I will never be able to swear I believe in something, I will always question things... It's a curse.  People have told me to pray for a sign, people tell me god talks to them and helps them in certain situations. The reason I don't believe in this is because, if we can believe in something so strongly, our minds will think of a "god-like answer" which we will follow. God in theory is perfect, therefore if we think of something god would say, we think of the best answer we can think of, the "perfect thing" to do. Our minds are a beautiful thing, they control everything in our body. People in Africa with AIDS were given Placebo's (sugar pills) and told it was medicine that will help with AIDS, Oddly enough, many of these people which took these sugar pills said they felt alot better after taking the pills, and they believed it helped. Clearly since the brain thought it will help, the brain helped the body battle the disease as if the drug would, so obviously this is proof that if we believe in something enough it can come true for them.  I really hope there is a heaven, It seems so perfect. But sometimes things that sound too perfect, are.  Heres a lyric from a song by Modest Mouse that stuck out when I listened to it, It sums up alot of my thoughts.
