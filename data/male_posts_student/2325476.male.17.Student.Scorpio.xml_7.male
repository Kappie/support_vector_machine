And this isn't a slight to the people i dont mention here, if i talk to you any consquential amount, i think you're awesome, but there's only three people i know that can make you feel really good about yourself by just talking to you. I really dont know why, i guess it has something to do with the fact that they always make eye contact, they never have a negative thing to tell you, they're supportive of you no matter what your opinions and ideas are, and are just agreeable people. Maria and Kim in Virginia are two of the people, I just always feel good about myself after talking to them, they're so supportive of me. And here in Charlotte there's Mary Kate. I'll admit i barely even know her, but she's cool and i already consider her a good friend. I dont think it's possible to leave a conversation with her feeling anything but good.  Anyway, yea, i thought i should mention these three of my friends.  You guys rock!! :)
