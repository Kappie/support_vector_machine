I was going to fill out another one because of the first's popularity, so I got a separate one from Melody's livejournal; I was about 75% done with it when it got deleted.  Bah.  3. I finished the two essays (English and Heidi) that had been worrying me.  I think they turned out alright.  Ahhh, no more cramming.  4. No more school and no more work for a while.  Need I say more?  5. Yes, I so need.  According to Kaplan, my ski thing got a mixed response.  You probably don't know what I'm talking about, but lemme tellya, hmmmmm.  Maybe it's down to one.  We'll see.  6. Pretty much the only good thing I can do over the vacation other than skiing and partying with Richie and them is the Heidi year-long project.  Groan.  7. Mock Trials tonight lifted my humbug spirits.  I was tired out from all the schoolwork I've had recently, and vacation was looking not so good.  But then it was Mock Trials, and I was actively working on it, and it was fun.  Yay.  8. I inadvertently acted jerkily toward Jessica Li the other day.  It was in the morning, A-Block, the day of a math test, in math, and I was asking her some question about our English class or something.  She said she was taking the test, but that didn't really register, so I was like, "Whatever, just answer my question!"  Well, I don't think she minded that much.  And this is someone who thinks Guacamole is a country.  9. Matt Woolf wrote a seventeen-page essay on Cecil Rhodes for Heidi.  Mine is six pages, but it's all important.  His is probably a lot of crap and filler, but Heidi is just going to look at how many pages it is and get him an A-plus-plus-double-check-star (Loren).  Another Matt Woolf thing: I was thinking about the movie "21 Grams," and I was like, "Matt Woolf, you know everyone loses exactly twenty-one grams at the exact moment of his death?" and Matt was like, "Yes, they call it the weight of the soul..."  And that would have been enough but then he had to insert his Woolfiness: "...Even though it's mass."  And we had a good laugh.  10. Anyway, a gay-but-heterosexual christmukkah to all and to all a fair evening.
