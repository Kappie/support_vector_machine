GO 04S08!   although i want to add that i do not belong to the band of As and Bs. =[ oh well. ANYWAY we did super well for chem too! more than 50% of us got A! and well nana, elane and jasmine did us proud to by scoring 80+++ marks la. 0_o from now on, we shall ALL approach nana for chemistry tuition ok! or better still during chem promos, we just sit next to her. x) okay anyway the real reason why i updated was to highlight the funniest thing that happened during PE today. heh mr mennon wasn't around, so we had captains ball again. yes again. it should be made our class game man. so yes, elsa was on the opposite team with wei jian and wee siang while nana, sj and i were on the other team with a few others obviously. so well halfway through the game, wei jian intercepts one of our teams passes and so yes the ball is in his hand. then suddenly elsa starts shouting  'WEE SIANG WEE SIANG HERE!' . and then she repeats herself again. now isn't that funny? here is elsa screaming wee siangs name while the ball is in  wei jians  hand! at first no one seemed to notice the mistake and suddenly it all hit us and we got all confused and couldn't stop laughing. while well of course elsa felt very embarrassed. heh. okay that's all. and one last note. WE HAVE A NEW SOFTBALLER IN THE HOUSE.    NURIA!    let's welcome here with a round of applause! x)
