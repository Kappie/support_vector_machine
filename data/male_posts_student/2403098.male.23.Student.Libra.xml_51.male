They don't infringe on my life too much, but I'm just about tired of hearing the careless, good-time ditty by this 1-hit-wonder sensation of a band.  This group of individuals has been riding around on the edge of success for 20 some years now, and I think it's time to say goodbye.  I was in the shower today listening to my shower radio, as I always do when I shower, and "Celebrate Good Times" came on.  It sent me into a fit of RAGE for some reason.  I know you're picturing me freaking out now, throwing Panteen Pro-V shampoo bottles around and ripping the white tiles off the wall, but it really wasn't that bad.  In fact, I wasn't even standing up.  Being that I have been sick, I was laying down (as I often do when I am sick or hungover) on the shower floor, and letting the water fall on me.  It's more relaxing that way, and besides I had no energy.  I think that is what made me so mad.  I was a prisoner to the song "Celebrate Good Times..C'MON!"  I had to sit there, weak from this cold, laying on the bottom of my shower floor and endure the 3 minutes of that song because I wasn't able to reach the shower radio to change the station.  Back when the song first hit the charts, I'm sure it was a feel-good, fun time for all to be had every time it would come on the air.  I don't blame you people who were alive @ the time.  I don't think I was alive, but I could be wrong.  (Keep in mind, i wasn't listening to anything but songs by, oh, say.. the muppets from 1980 through around 1985... okay through 1997, whatever, get off my back).  Back to my point.  The song sucks guys.  I was laying there in the shower picturing just how clever it was when it was played at the first basketball game.  Then it was on at the first New Years Eve party.. and that was so fun and everyone was all drunk and dancing and celebrating good times c'mon.  Then I'm sure it was cool at the first inauguration Ball when all the candidates broke loose with the big election victory under their belts, and danced around like they weren't 65.  And then the basketball game again.. it was fun that year too.  OKAY, jump to 20 years later.  ITS OVER.  I dont' want to hear the song anymore than I want to hear another novelty song such as Achey Breaky Heart.  Please stop.  I get sick to my stomach when I see Cool and his gang on some talk show as a guest band.  What, WHAT, are they going to play some new hit?  NO, they're going to play "Celebrate Good Times" over and over again until we just can't stop celebrating such good times, c'mon.  I say we need to start BOYCOTTING this shit.  I am almost irritated knowing that there are still royalties being paid to Cool and his whole gang (how many people are in this gang, I do not know) for this song each time it is played.  God, I wonder why this got under my skin so much.  Actually it didn't, but it was something fun to post about.  No one reads this shit anyway.  Next time someone has a Barmitsfa (spelling?? sorry i'm not Jewish), or a wedding, or a DJ at a Jr. High dance, PLEASE don't give in and let anyone play "Celebrate Good Times" I beg of you.  This will just keep the song alive, and folks lets let the thing die already.  Pull the plug on the old bastard and bury it.  "I heard my mamma cry, I heard her pray the night Chicago died."  I wonder what this song is about.  Sorry, brain lapse, I'm listening to "1-hit-wonders" station on AOL Radio.  I know, i'm ASKING for it, because out of NO where they're sure to play "Celebrate Good Times" sooner or later.  I better change the station in a hurry!
