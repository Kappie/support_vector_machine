Ok I'm pretty pissed off about it.  Anyways who needs to watch it when you can play! Thats right folks, you can catch some of the folks that visit this board in the flesh for a bit of soccer action! I'm sure you are all dying to hear the details so here they are:   Kempt Field 2pm   You could possibly even catch me there! And beat me into submission for writing all these sucky posts and subjecting you to the written diarrohea.  Should be a great day! (maybe for me).   How many exclamation marks did I put down........
