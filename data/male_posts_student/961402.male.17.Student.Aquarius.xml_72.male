I'm basically a lackey in the IT department...I need to eat breakfast. This post to be finished in a bit...  That was funesque. For the third and finalish time, IT lackey==good. Pay is said to be excellent and I keep finishing work faster than they can find it. I've been building computers since Thursday and have about , um, 15 so far. This is awesome. I'm getting paid to hang around computers and fix other people's tech problems. It's like being at home, only better. And they have cooler LCD screens and always-available bad coffee. And the occasional pie.  My bosses are Jay Victor (to avoid confusion, everyone now calls me "Jie" except for Jay, because he doesn't speak in the third person to himself), a twenty-something hockey player, IT guy, maker of bad jokes, and neat freak, and John Lee, who might or might not be a  urlLink supertaster . Old guy, lame jokes, fun. There's also this guy named 'Kevin' but I haven't really seen much of him and he's never really given me anything to do. Anyway, it's a good job and it gives me stuff to do (and when it doesn't I'm supposed to goof around online, Jay's orders).    Oh, got to date yesterday. Well, not really, but I got to pull weeds with the Felleys for a few hours. Eh, CAS hours are CAS hours. And I got a really good dinner and brownies afterwards. And Monty Python watching.  TMBG should be coming soon. Lemme check on that...Holy Close Relation of Excrement!(tm) it's on Saturday! I gotta get back to  urlLink John  on that...  That's all I can think of right now. I gotta finish that Costa Rica posting...
