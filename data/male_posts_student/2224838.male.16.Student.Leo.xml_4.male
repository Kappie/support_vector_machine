I have invested much of my time in high school to journalism and photography, but I need to decide if those are the things that I want to do for the rest of my life. I know that if I have enough desire to do something, there should be nothing to stop me. Right now the only thing stopping me is myself.  Man.. they really need to add the comment feature to Blogger.
