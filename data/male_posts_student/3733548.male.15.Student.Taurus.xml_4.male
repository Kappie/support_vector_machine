I went to Charlies house last night, it was AWESOME!! we had about, 5 guitars goin at the same time, it was great, all there, praisin God, yea, but I forgot my guitar, so halfway thru I went and talked to Amanda, and then that was about the basis of my night. Went to the mall today, got some "Love Spell" put on me and saw some girl pick her wedige, that was repulsive, what  HAS  the world come to, when girls have the fortitude to pull up their skirts and pick wedgies? I dont know. Well, I'll post more later, mom needs the computer.
