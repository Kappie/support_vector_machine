Now I dont mean that I'm gonna start doin drugs or some shit like that. I'm going to start doing things on a whim, and do things that may not be fucking up, but things i never would've had the gall to do before.  I am a teenager. That means that I get a lot of things. Angst, insecurity, lots of hair, and most importantly, the chance to fuck up. This is it, these are the years of my life where I can screw things up, and recover perfectly. These are the years that I'm supposed to be misguided, idiotic, brash, and inept, and learn from it, and damnit, thats what I intend to do.  And that, my friends, is why i'm looking forward to going back to school in 7-8 hours.
