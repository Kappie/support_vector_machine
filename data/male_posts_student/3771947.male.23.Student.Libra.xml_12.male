We pre-gamed atMcGrady's with $3 pitchers. I have no idea what happened at the end of the night, I left and went home and I assumed Dave  Brian were going home with chicks. Somehow I "abandoned them." Dave calls me at 2:45 and drunkenly starts telling me about how they are walking home and people are "laughing at them." I must have done an Indy 500 around that club 3 times before I left, and then I waited 10 minutes in my car. I offered to pick them up, instead, they told me to leave my door open and they never show up. (what PROBABLY happened: Dave  Brian THOUGHT they were going to get ass, so they talked to some random girls until about 2:35 when they realized they weren't) I guess they expect me to be thedriver and just wait around, right.    Friday: I was getting bored painting my bathroom and Seth and Chris called me up. They were at McGrady's so I met up with them. So I guess crack head Jarett has been telling people I think I am "THE SEXIEST MAN IN THE LEHIGH VALLEY"(i have no idea where that came from)and I won't hang out with certain people. What the fuck? I get into McGradys and Seth and Chris are yelling that at me. I learn the story, and it was funny until they started telling random girls that I was actually voted the title, then it was just embarrassing. I was not drunk enough for that. So Steph (the ex ex) shows up, obviously checking on me with her fat samoan friend Ruth, who I HATE. Guy's buy them shots and then they run out when Kristin (Penn State cheerleader who I used to talk to), who was at Main Gate yesterday, comes up and says hi to me. Steph calls me drunk crying later that night, telling me I am a cheat and always will be? What the fuck?    Well after McGrady's we stop at the HO, beat. I saw the loser Notre Dame High School (my alma matter)crowd, still going NOWHERE with their lives. I have never seen it so empty, then I remember about some getto flyer that some idiot left on my car Thursday night. It was like drawn with a marker and touted some band called 730 playing at Banana Joes. We end up there at midnight and Chris is the only one who pays, he comes out, we lick our hands and rub the little red star on both of our hands - extra beer money. banana Joes had a decent crowd. Seth saw Jess, one of the waitresses at McGrady's, who he is MADLY in love with. I tell him to go talk to her and all he manages to say is "where are you going" as she starts walking. She replies with "the bathroom." That kids got game! Steph shows up here too, so I danced with her for a little and her fucking friend Ruth gave me the finger. Next time I see that fat bitch I am definitely dumping a beer on her. Why the fuck can't she mind her own business?Seth gets his ass grabbed by some faggot, he finds him in the parking lot and bitch slaps the guy right across the face. The two girls the gay guy is with start defending him and step in front of him. They start yelling, Seth starts yelling, and the gay guy starts yelling "I'm Gay! So what."What a scene! We leave and as we are walking away one of the girls yells to Seth, "you look gay anyway." Well, drama, it follows me wherever I go. It was pretty funny watching that though. Cris and Seth are going to West Chester tonight and invited me to tag along. I'm not sure what I am going to do today. Got to finish the house and hopefully get in touch with my roomamate at Georgetown, they are paring me up with a senior, thank god.    Some random individual loves Bethlehem locals. I'm not sure if this person is trying to be funny or a tough guy. I say what I want and always will. If it gets me into trouble, I am a Marine Sniper, and if I can handle Iraqi insurgents with Ak 47's I'm PRETTY confident NO ONE in the Lehigh Valley is much of a threat.
