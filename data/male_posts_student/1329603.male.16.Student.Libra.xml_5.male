I still prefer O_o though. It looks like Pete.  Anyway... Patrick has raised a fairly good point today, being that Sam was only gone for 3 days. Soooooooooo... is she back? I doubt it, but still... why hasn't she blogged? I believe she must have misjudged and she was actually gone for a week, but said she was gone for 3 days. I think. Well, it's logical because it's something I'd do. Yeah...  I've started on a Rei Ayanami fanlisting ^_^ I'm getting totally obsessed with Rei, actually, it's unnerving. I'm even dreaming about her now. Believe me, there's nothing scarier than seeing yourself as an anime character. Unless you're Zoe and then you're not far off anyway. (Sorry!)  Lennon is being incredibly unnerving. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, it's working. Linden, the computer man, came round yesterday and said I'd have to demolish it and reinstall Windows. And suddenly.... workage! I don't understand it. Norton found a coupla viruses but I don't think that should sort out the whole computer... never mind...  Once the Rei listing is up, everyone who reads this has to go and watch Evangelion so that they can join!  Love, Jon Roskilly
