That’s nothing cool, what is cool is the amount of people I ran into who I know, and the amount of times I listened to Furious Angels (the album). I ran into Crazy legs, a part of mully’s crew, in my very own IT lecture, he does I @ QUT and I didn’t know this, nor have we seen each other before, strange. We were both under the impression that the other went to UQ. Very WT   To make matters worse, I also ran into Zoe  Miller, Zo  miller, they’re almost inseperable, ZOEMILLER! I even saw Scotty; A high school random. I saw Beeva Huoey’s buddy and even Katie. Which was weird because she definitely had the day off. (Every time I see Kate I’m reminded of those china dolls; You know, the white porcelain ones where if you poke it, it falls over and shatters everywhere. But the difference is when I poked Katie; I got slapped.)  That’s Crazy-Legs, Zomiller, Scotty, Beeva  Katie. That’s 6 people. In the space of 3 hours. Too coincidental for me, I slept with a machete under my bed. Just in case.
