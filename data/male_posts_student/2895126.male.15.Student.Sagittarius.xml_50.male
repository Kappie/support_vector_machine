I thought I did well, although my stage fright is so bad I couldn't feel my fingers. The rest of me felt great. (Haha.)  2) During this retreat, which was supposed to be a spiritual reflection day, Paul Youchak got up and gave this little speech about a metaphor he had thought up. He claimed that when someone rips a single star off the flag and burns it, it's no big deal, but when they burn it, it's this horrible thing. Then he related that to how unimportant a single prayer is to the entire Church. Now, I don't remember how he tied this in, but he also said that we should only go after bad people and ignore good people; they don't need praise because they already know that they're good.  So I waited a while, and got up and argued. I said that burning one star is as bad as burning all the stars. One star, representative of one state, being burnt would make us no longer the United States. Then I related that to the Church: one prayer can make a lot of difference and is an important part of the Church, not to be underestimated.  So then he comes up and we start to argue on stage, and so Sara Mineo and Mike Hauser do too. Good times.  3) I went to Eat 'N Park with Emily, Kate, and Corey. My mom practically pushed me out of the car because we were blocking someone's way. So I'm just standing here without any money. She had just driven away. And given me her cell phone. I called dad, but I suppose before he had left or gotten too far, mom remembered and came back. It was an interesting experience.  4) Then we went to Northway Mall and saw Shrek 2. Before we actually went to see the movie, we hung around and got ice cream. Much fun.  5) Corey, unfortunately, got sick and had to go home before we saw the movie. But it was pretty good. We had opted for a later showing so that we could go around the mall a bit, and eventually that rather backfired. It was 11:30 and the mall was closed, so we had to go out through the back exit into the cold, whereupon I had the pleasant prospect of waiting for my mother for 20 minutes. Fortunately, Mrs. Wilfong let me and Emily stay in her car while we waited outside the (closed) Borders. When Emily's mom got there, we sort of traded off and Mrs. Wilfong left. It was only about 3 minutes before my mom got there. An "adventure."
