Im trying to separate whats real  Im running in a wheel   From green to red our days pass by  you Wait for a sign to tell us why Are we dancing all alone?  Collect some stars to shine for you  And start today cause there are only a few  The sign of times my friend  Avoid infinity?  Are you for real?  Just scratch the surface, and you will find  Something to blame for a long lost time   From green to red our days pass by  you Wait for a sign to tell us why Are we dancing all alone?
