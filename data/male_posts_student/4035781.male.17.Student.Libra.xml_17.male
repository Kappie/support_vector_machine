The first one... well don't you wish you know what went through my head... heh heh.. In the second one I was an karate black belt teaching my own class in my own dojo. Was pretty cool, my kicks were superb... and I got to play with weapons.  Have you ever felt you were living in a dream? Everything is rather surreal, you feel unconstrained by normal limitations. You act without hesitation, live in the moment. Personal saftey drifts out of thought and you act on impluses. I don't feel this way often, but when I do it is quite the experience. Though, I have to admit I've heard of this way of expression before, so the idea is by no means orginal. Normally when one would wake from the dream of their lives, they would die. For me however that is merely the end of the feeling of involunerability and reality comes crashing back down. Just for reference here, no I do not do drugs, and 99.89% of the time I'm completely sober. It would be sweet to be in this state of mind for a karate class... I assure you, some ass would be kicked.  Let's see now for my actual day... For the most part it was a bit of a let down. I did get to hang out with Josh, Adam and Karen. Just got pushed back due to conflicting schedules and Adam getting hopelessly lost and delayed by stopping trains. So, was cut short.. didn't learn the kick up technique; however, I got pretty good at foosball and listened to some cool music. Driving class was boring... as per my expectations I doodled for 3.75 hrs on a hard plastic chair till I couldn't feel my behind. Yea, and got plans for a get together with michelle - shot down. Though I understand and respect the reasoning. Still, don't leave Me out in the cold too long.  D
