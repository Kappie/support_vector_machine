Well, upon thinking about this i realized, they would form the ultimate war machine; both are completly souless and evil. I have decided that i shall start to biogentically culture a DNA strand of a nazgul using the vast amounts of information the LOTR club has about them, along with finding the remains of Adolf Hitler and his nazi hordes. I shall create this freaks of nature over the next 10 years and by the time they are created, humans will have decayed so much physically due to a lack of movement in general, created by the vast use of machines, and i will finally be able to take over France.  SO if you know any LOTR geeks, please contact me for their information, also if you are or know any nazis, please tell me where you live and any information you may have on the location of Hitler's corpse.
