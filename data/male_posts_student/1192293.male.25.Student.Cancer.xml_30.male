Let's see, since my last post I've... Been To Japan  Back Got Divorced (or estranged, whatever.) Moved Halfway Across The Country Got Myself Back In College Opened A Recording Studio With My Pal Drew Produced A Kick-Ass Record Got My (sorta)Ex-Wife Pregnant Earned Straight A's  B's In My First Semester In School In Five Years And, Finally, Reunited With My Wife. So, I've been a wee bit busy.  Anyway, expect more frequent posts from here on out.  I've got promises to keep, and asses to kick before I sleep.  Hail to the king, baby.
