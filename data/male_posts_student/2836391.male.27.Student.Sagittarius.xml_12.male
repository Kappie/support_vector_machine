When my friend asked me to be a Godparent I felt honoured, and at the same time a little scared. What did I know about children, about how to help raise them? Because of the circumstances my friend is in, I spend a lot of time with her and Natalia, just being there, being an adult male in her life.   Now that I am studying teaching, and learning more about how children learn, and the things that affect them, I realise that everything I say or do around Natalia may have a profound impact on her life. It shows me that more than ever before that I have an important role in her life, and makes me very conscious of my actions.  Some day I want to have children of my own. Right now though, I don't think I would be ready for the huge responsibility that being a parent is, and I have to take my hat off to my friend who is doing this on her own.
