She thinks that, instead of trying to find diplomatic solutions, we should bomb everyone that hates us into submission and make everyone else fear us.  Right.  I don't even know where to start, that's just... dumbfoundingly stupid and dangerous.  The thing about terrorism is, you can't kill every last one of them, and the more you bomb countries in the Middle East, the more Middle Easterners hate us and start supporting terrorism.  Many such countries, as Iran, which has hated us intensely since the Carter Administration, have nuclear weapons, so preemptive military action might not be the best first option.  I really hope she isn't representative of her party, or the United States -- and the world -- are in serious trouble.  Melody got me  The Question of God: C. S. Lewis and Sigmund Freud Debate God, Love, Sex, and the Meaning of Life  by Dr. Armand M. Nicholi, Jr.  It's pretty good so far.  That was very thoughtful of her.  It's good that she brought that over, too, because I just finished  Give Me a Break  by John Stossel.  It reminded me of similar books I've read including  The O'Reilly Factor  by Bill O'Reilly, and  In Our Humble Opinion  by Tom and Ray Magliozzi.  Mr. Stossel, the co-anchor of ABC's "20/20," has some very provocative themes, such as the case for limited government since the free market always effects ultimate progress and superiority over bureaucratic programmes.  He also details the problem of media exposure to relatively insignificant threats, argues against the exaggeration of the benefits of organic food and the threats of global warming by environmentalists, and realizes the folly of illicit drug criminalization.  It's a very provocative read.     Yesterday, I went to "I, Robot" with Jonny.  It was a pretty good movie, and it was fun.  I've gotten into Nerds Ropes even though they're trayf because of gelatin.  W/e.  Not much else is going on; I'm too busy procrastinating from doing IDs/Spanish.  Talk to you later.
