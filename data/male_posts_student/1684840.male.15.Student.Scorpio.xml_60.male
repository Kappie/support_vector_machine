After another like, three hours rest, I woke up and had breakfast etc. and then tidied my room up.  I have somehow now regained my fascination in Pokemon Cards again, and Sea Monkeys too.  I think when we like something, we still like it but we don't realise it then later in life we re-discover it and like it again lol.  At least now I have two more things I can spend money on :)  I'm beginning to wonder whether knowing that I won't be doing my GCSEs will effect how well I do my coursework.  I'm still going to have to try hard though and do the work well :)
