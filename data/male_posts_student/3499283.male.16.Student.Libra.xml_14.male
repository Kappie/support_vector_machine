Something malfunctioned with my alarm clock and I was woken up by Becky's phonecall making sure I was on my way to pick her up for school.   I "lunged" out of bed, "dashed" to the shower, "sped" through my daily cleansing, and "sprinted" to my car. Yeah things went by pretty fast.   Well it all turned out fine; I got to Becky's house only 5 or 6 minutes after I said I would be there and it was no trouble finding a place to park.  We'll see what magic happens tomorrow morning.    In all of my classes except for English we are done, well except for one last Bio quiz.  Mrs. Motter has the genius idea of having us write an essay in class for the next two days instead of reviewing.  S-S-S-STUPID!  Bio was once again entertaining today.  The boring movie, rather Cliff's unusual satisfaction with his PB sandwich prompted more creative artwork.  Yeah Cliff we know how you like that peanut butter. OH YEAH!   After school I went to Foxdale to apply for the job opening but everywhere I went they redirected me to where I might be able to pick up a form.  I swear its a game they like to play and I was just their pawn today.  Those mischevious retirees, you just wait until I'm serving your food, then we'll see who's the pawn!!! MWAHAHAHAHA.  Ahem, anyhoo no need to worry, old people rock.   I have no idea why I'm writing tonight I am so tired.  I really shouldn't be because I just got up from an accidental 3 hour nap after school.  Highway Pizza for jazz band must have really worn me out or something.  The Warped Tour 2004 compilation comes out tomorrow, w00t.  Peace  Chad
