It's especially captivating if you watch someone engaged in a conversation.  You can almost see the thoughts bouncing around the inside of their mind.  I like to watch people's eyes--but only when they're not looking at mine.  When you watch someone's eyes, it's like you're on some rooftop, watching the person go about their day.  Or it's like following someone, and being so close you can feel their heartbeat, and keeping so quiet that they don't notice.  It only lasts until they look up at you and your eyes lock witht theirs for a moment lasting longer than words can express--because it's a different kind of time, one that can't be measured by number or word, only by thought.  Then you look down, embarassed."  Straight out my black book, comment.
