Early attempts were thwarted by a German website and an inability to download the program.  Then, as if the heavens opened, at 3:30am last night, an English version of the page appeared and an hour later I had Tweedy's new opus.  I've listened to the album about 6 times through today and am currently enjoying it via burned CD.  People on various boards have called it a logical progression from YHF but I would argue that it reminds me more of "Loose Fur" (and then some hipster would say that was an off shoot of YHF...and at that point I would punch his latte drinking mug).  Ambient noise and fuzzy guitar leads dominate "Ghost" and while it proves an interesting listen, Wilco is at its best when putting aside the atmospheric gimmics and gets down to the core of the songs.  "Late Greats" and "Hummingbirds" stand out as two shining examples of a band playing together with tasteful overdubs.  The 9 min. of noise on "Less Than You Think" follows in the vein of "Reservations" from YHF with less musicality.  "Wishful Thinking" stands as a great synthasis of what the band can do with atmospherics, a regular band mix and moving down to sparse parts.     At times the mix is agitating (though most likely on purpose) as in "At Least That's What You Said" as the beginning is barely audible until turning up the volume, and then being blasted by drums.  These sorts of experiments with mix detract from the song(s) as a whole, though would probably sound fantastic live.      For all the minor detractors listed, this is a phenominal album on first (or sixth) listen and stands perched as an album that grows on a listener with time.  Jeff Tweedy's voice cuts through the songs in a clarity not yet heard on any Wilco album and Stirrat's basslines demand attention as an intigral part of all songs.  As for the drums, Kotche's presence is not as up front in YHF, but still solid and dependable as ever.  An attempt to follow up an album the likes of YHF would be nearly impossible for any other band, but Wilco, a band always known for taking chances and changing on every album, is equal to the task and will not disapoint hardcore fans and novices alike.
