Sure there was some wicked weather and that may be a tad important considering how dangerous it was, but really Saturday's sports transcended all of that for me.    First I woke up at 9:00 to watch the Live Commentary of the FA Cup final match between Manchester United and Millwall.  If you don't follow what the English call "football" Manchester United is one of the best teams in the English Premiership or all of Europe for that matter.  Millwall is a midtable team in England's first division (one division lower and the Premiership) who was lucky to make it past the fourth round let alone all the way to the finals.  Anyway, Man U had an easy time winning 3-0.  American goalkeeper Tim Howard became the first American to play in a FA Cup final since John Harkes did for Sheffield Wednesday in 1993 and first American to win the FA Cup ever.  Congrats to Timmy Howard.  He won the FA Cup, won Premiership Goalkeeper of the year honours, had a 0.97 Goals Against Average, got a bunch of clean sheets, plays for one of the best clubs around the world... but only managed to beat my Chicago Fire once out of 10 games when he played for the Metrostars!! Take that!  Then the girls soccer playoff game.  They played the hardest I have ever seen them play.  I'll be honest ladies, not necessarily the best, but certainly the hardest.  The game was 0-0 for most of the match, but in the final 15 minutes Andrew managed to out score us 2-1.  It was a great season.  I enjoyed going to your home games (and some away games too) no matter if you won or lost.  Next was the Cubs 7-1 win over the Cardinals.  I didn't watch the game because I was at the girls soccer game.  Hey, I thought "watch the Cubs or watch the girls soccer game.  What should I do?"  I chose the latter and I made the right choice.  When I got home from the game, I watched the New England Revolution v. Metrostars match.  It was a well played match as New England really dominated the second half.  Pat Noonan scored for the Revolution and Cornell Glen scored for the Metrostars.  I gave my legs a wicked workout as I used this exercise machine in my house.  You sit on a seat and push it back with your legs while two elastic bands resist the seat.  I was on it for over 30 minutes and did over 1200 reps and I can still feel it.  Next was the NASCAR All-Star Race.  When the Nextel Open got the green flag, there was a pile up before the first turn of the first lap.  Hey guys, drive much?  In the main event, there was another wreck when Kurt Busch ran into Greg Biffle and after that all hell broke loose.  My favourite driver Tony Stewart won the first segment, but finished 3rd.  Matt Kenseth won.  Finally, I watched the San Jose Earthquakes v. Los Angeles Galaxy match online.  To put it lightly, these two teams HATE each other.  Last year in the playoffs, Los Angeles had a 4-0 aggregate lead with about a half hour left in the second leg and San Jose came back to score five times and advance. (It was the greatest MLS game ever) Today, San Jose got out to a 3-0 lead and when they thought it was safe, Los Angeles pulled two back to make it 3-2 courtesy of Andreas Herzog and Joseph Ngwenya. (Herzog has got to be one of the best passers I have ever seen) But a monumental comeback was not to be as Dwayne DeRosario put the game away for good with a strike of his own to seal the win for the 'Quakes 4-2.  Oh yeah, the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Philadelphia Flyers 2-1 in Game 7 of the NHL Eastern Conference playoffs.  Tomorrow I will be glued to the tube again as my Chicago Fire play the Columbus Crew at Soldier Field on ESPN 2 at 15:00.  That's 3 pm if you don't speak European.  'Till then, see ya and go Fire.  Oh yeah, check out my good friend Stephen's blog  urlLink Bubbadoo's Place
