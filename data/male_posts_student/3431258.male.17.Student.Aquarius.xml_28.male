I also noticed that i contract no spywares instead of 40 per weeks! No new update for  gmail  as they did not give me any invites yet.   I don't know if i mentioned it earlier, but  Paulo  lended me  Dungeon Siege . What a blast. It's like  Baldur's Gate , except it's not boring! Still nothing for  Pandoras Tomorrow , except the fact that  Helder  wants to try it at all cost, altought he perfectly know it will not run on his pc.   Mmm, yeah, did a lot of cleaning in my room for the appartment. Almost everything is in boxes and only require transport to the building. My mother is sick since about 3 days, some breathing problems. She is at the hospital right now, let's hope it's not cancer.   2 days until the exams start , and next week, thursday, it's vacation.   Also we found who stole my cards.  Regards,  Zephyr
