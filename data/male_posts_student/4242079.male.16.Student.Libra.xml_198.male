In another, it makes absolutely no sense. Earlier today, I was ready to explode with one emotion. Now, tonight, I'm ready to explode with another. How can I do this? How come it has to be this way? BECAUSE YOU LIED TO ME! YOU DID THIS TO YOURSELF! You exposed me for what I am. Shallow, heartless, and self-serving. And if what you say is true, then you are a genius. The intricatly woven character and the way you can create a day to day ordinary life. But like most geniuses, you got ahead of yourself, and it collapsed. Didn't it? DIDN'T IT? ANSWER ME!!!! Nevermind. Don't answer me. I don't know what...I don't know...I. AHHHHHHHHH. Fuck. FUCK. DOUBLE FUCK. This is how it has to be....because you've proven something to me about myself. And I hate you for it. And I hate myself for it.  I think I will be taking a break from internet life. Maybe a long one, maybe a short one. I may still blog, I may not. I may be back. I may not. Probably, eventually.  But for now.  it's odd how feelings linger. Well fuck you too
