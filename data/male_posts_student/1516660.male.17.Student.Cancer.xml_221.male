Both of them have something in common: extremely easy for the first 2/3 of the paper, but the last 1/3 is very very tough. Woah!!   E-Maths was okay...I don't know the only about 3 questions ba. Kinda easy the paper. I never saw one question before, the other question got me muddled (similar triangles! They aren't similar at all! How to find, you tell me?). Meow meow!!  Physics was very easy compared to Prelims. Miss Tan sets papers 2-3 grades higher than O Level standard. That's a good thing, if you ask me. When we see the O Level paper, we won't get scared easily, because we been through a lot of Miss Tan's papers. Yeah. As again, the Section A's questions were extremely straight-forward. Mostly calculations, with few (and simple) theory questions. Section B was a killer. Not really, but the difficulty level can be compared to Miss Tan's. However, all are theory questions. Just apply what you learn can liao. Meow!! I felt happier you know. It gave me optimism to do the Chem Paper! Must maintain high Chem marks, and get more Physics marks. Then 'A' will be mine!! Meow meow!!  Hmm...today leh, I got a bit scared you know. Mrs Thong lor! Tell us so many consequences. What if I fail English? Actually, I don't think I'll fail. The least is a C6. The best mark I can get is B3, if I am lucky, A2. I certainly don't want a 6! Must at least get a B you know. I must be extra carfeul with tenses and the answering of questions. Must be stringent in my checking!!   SS ma, I have confidence I can do well. Hmm...it really have to depend on the questions that are coming out. I think I can at least secure a distinction lor. I just want an A1 for Combined Humane! Must you know! M-U-S-T!!   Hmm...tomorrow's gonna be a killing day on my finger, espeically the fourth finger on my right hand. That's where the pen lies, and it will hurt badly. I have to write 3 freaking papers tomorrow, each invloving at least an essay (summary for compre...and 2 drafts too!). I pity my finger. I am borrowing a finger band from Wendy. Meow!  Ayiah. I think I stop writing liao la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
