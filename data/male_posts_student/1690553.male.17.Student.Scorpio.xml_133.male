Pak Lang and Mak Teh is already there when we arrived but Uncle Azwan, the one that will be engaged had not arrived yet. Wonder where he is back then? It's impossible for him not to be here for such an important ocassion.  He finally showed up at 5:30 pm, only to complain his body aching all over due to representing the Ordnance Corps in rugby and already feeling feverish. Uncle Azman and Pak Long arrived shortly after while my grandma is busy at the kitchen with my aunties cooking rendang for tomorrow.  After Maghrib prayer we started being busy with the  hantaran  (gifts), a neighbour made the  sirih junjung  while the rest is taken care of by Auntie Hamisah and Auntie Siti. As agreed with the women's family, we will send 7 tray of  hantaran . Meanwhile, Uncle Azwan is busy arranging a portion of the  wang hantaran  in the album.     Uncle Azwan busy arranging the money   Then after Isya', the meeting starts to discuss the itineary for tomorrow. Pak Long as the eldest son volunteered to be the spokeperson for tomorrow. Also discussed some other details such as how to get to there and such.   The Engagement Day   At 7am we are already busy cooking for the  kenduri doa selamat , scheduled at 9am. The  kenduri doa selamat  went as planned and it took about 45 minutes. After that is some last minute preparation and finishing. Uncle Azwan took the trouble going to the town to buy the metal polish and polish the case which will hold the engagement ring.     Last minute polishing      My Grandparents and Cousins   At 11am, our five-car convoy started our journey to Felda Sg. Retang at Jerantut. Uncle Azwan didn't came along - hold the fort, that's the order. ;-) We arrived at noon and the engagement ceremony start soon after. After some discussion and doa selamat, Miss Halijah Ibrahim is declared officially engaged to my uncle, Captain Ahmad Azwan bin Osman. Insya'Allah their wedding wil take place after Eid-ul Fitr end of this year.     Auntie Siti and Auntie Hamisah      My grandma and her would be daughter-in-law   By the way, next Sunday is another uncle's wedding at Mentakab. ^_^ And oh yes, what do you all think of this new MacOS-themed template? I made it myself. :-)
