Friday at 1:40 we will be partaking in some fine cinema, as we watch a two and a half-hour Shinto acid trip(Spirited Away). Which is a wonderful movie, and you're all encouraged to come, unless I don't like you. If you aren't sure if I like you, here are some signs.  1. You have a webpage and I don't have it listed(could be attributed to laziness, so search for the following more) 2. I have tried to kill you many times. 3. I have said, "X, I do not like you" 4. I ignore you in social situations 5. I have declined an offer to have sex with you 6. You are ugly 7. You want in my pants(You know who you are, and more importantly I know who you are)  In other news I'm supposed to have a lap dancer for Gabe's birthday party by....tomorrow. At this point I'm turning to you, faithful readers. Any volunteers are welcome. I mean, even if you weren't invited, if you tell him you're there to dance on his lap while naked, I don't think he'll mind. Hmm...maybe Jessica should do this?  I rant on this subject way more than once a day, but I don't care.  How come there are so many people I want to sleep with, and so many people that want to sleep with me, and none of them are on both lists!   Thank you, please tune in next time for more of me.....naked.   I do believe this may be the first mention of Shiranne on the site. I could be wrong. Also, we never got a lap dancer.
