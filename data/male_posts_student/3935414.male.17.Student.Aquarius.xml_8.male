I was left alone at home as both my parents had gone out to attend a wedding dinner.      For me, itwould besuch a great time to be reading a thriller by the fireplace in this kind of atmosphere. I prepared a cup of hot chocolate and placed it on the coffee table so that I could enjoy while reading the thriller. It was indeed a cozy paradise for me.        Thoughts raced through my brains as I read the thriller "WHEN I AM ALONE AT HOME". Questions like "will there be ghosts in the house?" "Will there be any unusual phenomenon happening?"         I tried to push all these thoughts to the back of my mind as I continued reading the thriller. A charm caught my eye halfway through the story. It was a charm that could summon a friend to this world. The Charm goes    "  Alone at home,   Afraid you must,   Summon a friend,   Whom will bring you a smile."         Upon reading finished the charm, the lights in the living room suddenly flickered and went out. The only light that was left was from the burning fireplace. Long shadows of statues and objects cast themselves all over in the house. A sudden loud crash of sound was heard from the basement, it made my whole body jumped. I grabbed a torchlight and slowly made my way down the stairs to the basement. Mumbling of sounds were heard from inside the basement.  "cursed...dumb...why...idiotic"       I    slowly opened the basement door; it creaked like those of a haunted house. My father must had have it not oiled for years. I shone my torchlight across the basement and saw two bear liked ears and I asked,  Who are you? Please come out, I will not hurt you  That creature came out, starting I couldn't see clearly because it was hidden by the shadows cast upon it. To my amazement, it was the rainbow bear from the carebears. After telling me how he landed up here, I apologised to him and told him that it was the charm that I had read that actually caused him to be landed in the basement of my house.        We had really a great time together. Chit chatting, playing board games, telling cold jokes to each others and lots more. When my parents' car drove in, he disappeared suddenly. I found myself in the living room instead of my own bedroom with the rainbow bear, I was lying on the sofa by the fireplace. An unfinished cup of hot chocolate was still left in the same position that I had left it there moments ago.  Is it a dream? Or is it real at all? I found my answer when I saw the rainbow badge that was pinned on my pyjamas.
