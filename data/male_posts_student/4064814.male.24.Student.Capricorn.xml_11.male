It began shipping on Saterday, after two business days I should have recieved the package on Tuesday.  Well it turns out Fedex shipping was too efficient. One of the nice things about Fedex is they provided  urlLink online tracking , so I watched my laptop travel from California, to Memphis (the fedex hub) and today (Monday) it arrived in Toronto. The online tracking was then updated to say that the package was taken off the truck in Cambridge because the package was "not due for delivery".  I was all excited when I saw it land in Toronto. I mean how long could it take to get to Waterloo? Apparently, not long enough. Now I really wanted to have the laptop tonight and I was playing with the idea simply jumping on the bus to Cambridge and picking it up in person, so I called up Fedex.  A nice Fedex representitive explained to me that their two day guarentee did not guarentee a package to be delivered in  at most  two days, but  EXACTLY  two days. My package had arrived too quickly and so had to wait an extra day. When I asked about going directly to the Fedex depot in Cambridge to pick the package up myself, the representitive explained that this was not possible,  but  if I wanted to upgrade to one day service for  x  dollars, I could have it delivered tonight.  Now this sucks, but it doesn't suck as much this other  urlLink person  whose package was delayed for 5 days at a depot not 15 minutes from his house.  Okay, now as a customer I don't mind getting a package in two days when you say it will be there in at most 2 days. But when you make your tracking transparent enough that I can see a package being intentionally delayed that is  not  cool.  Why not surprise and delight your customers by occasionally delivering your packages a little early?? It's not like you will lose customers paying for the premium services because there is no guarantee that it will arrive early!
