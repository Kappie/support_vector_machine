Everybody is so actively participating in it... in fact, we're participating so actively that if we do not participate it would be awkward!  Everybody in our group is cool... well... at least i hope i didnt spoil it! loLZ!!    Timothy, Sonia, Jason, Sarah..... and mE!! I love YOuuu You LovE MeEE wE aRe 1 BiG FaMIleeee... haha...    Campus crusade for christ... I'll soon be actively participating in it soon...  Heard that their schedules are pretty busy.... I'm still caught between joining campus crusade or youth for christ... Like it or not, this two teams are subtly and constant loggerheads with each other... stress!  The people in both teams are so friendly, and I have friends on both sides as well....  Some more... nobody, when in YFC or CCC is in the other... It is kinda like an unwritten rule...    Dear God.. Lead me.. I'm so confused..I pray that you will guide my path and let me walk in Your light....    Today I played the synth in the main Sanctuary as well as led worship in the Agape Youth... So stress.. haha.. but I enjoyed it... I always enjoy serving God....  I found out that i could coordinate with Alvin as my 2nd synth then Karen.... Dunno why.. but guess it is because I have been playing with Alvin in the Sunday school to the Youth for 6 years already... lolz.... We forged out friendship out of the passion for music and God...    I've finally changed   completely  ... for those who know what I mean, I'm sure you're happy for me too... It's the path for God from now on....  My past.... at least for the past 1 and half year has been a year ridden with misery and sorrow, sadness and fear... That life I know is not what God wanted me to live, and for that matter, anybody to live.... And thats why I know, through God's grace have I suceeded in changing...    I hope those people who read this and found out about my past will not look down upon me... But know that I took great strength to change... For it is almost impossible to change...  but with God,  all  things are possible....      ~-=TrAnSForMaTioN!!!!=-~     Mood: Happy, Happy, Happy.........
