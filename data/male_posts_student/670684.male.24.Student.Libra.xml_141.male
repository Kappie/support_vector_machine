Kudos to Michael Moore for winning Best Documentary with  urlLink Bowling for Columbine , which if it were eligable for IMDB's  urlLink Top 250 Films , would be #2.  And anyone upset with Moore for using the stage as a bully pulpit, you haven't seen any of his work or read any of his books.  Good work on having large testicles, Michael Moore.    Speaking of war, interesting to see that MSN.com has a risque piece listed, regarding the  urlLink incredibly strong anti-American sentiment  in Iraq at the moment.  On Saturday someone tried to convince me that the Iraqi people were all for this regime change; while some might be, the numbers probably resemble those in America who would be estatic if George Bush was usurped from power.    My favorite article from today, though, regards Iraq's  urlLink serious deception  on the battlefield, and the breaking of War laws by fighting in civilian clothes and surrendering in order to bring the troops closer.  It reminds me a lot of how we fought the Revolutionary War, back in the days when armies would march to an area, look at their opponents, and then charge from there, not firing a shot until both sides were ready.  If I remember correctly, we hid behind trees and houses and structures in order to pick off soldiers as they were following the rules of war and marching peacefully through the streets.  "But they were marching through our streets," you may say.  Well, aren't we marching through Iraq's?
