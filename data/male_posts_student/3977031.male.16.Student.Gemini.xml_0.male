The Blog personally thinks that it is an insult to the memory of our brave men and women who have bravely and willingly died in service to constantly protest the war after it has started and blood has been shed. The time for protest is before the war before and the decision is made, but once it has been made we as Americans need to band together to support our troops.     The Blog also thinks it would be an insult to their memory to cease our occupation of Iraq before we are sure that conditions have been improved there because then they truly would have died in vain. The Blog fully realizes that we did not find any WMDs or terrorist links, but just because the invasion of Iraq did not directly benefit you today does not mean that it was a total waste.   It may not be important to you personally, but one more brutal dictator was removed from power. However, The Blog does not think that we need to start playing stop the dictator the way we played stop the communists (which most Americans were behind at the time) during the Cold War, but The Blog believes that deposing of Saddam was a great thing for Iraq no matter what he was or was not plotting.     Saddam was a man who committed genocide, ordered torture and unfair imprisonment for his own people, and owned multiple lavish palaces while most of his country lived in poverty. Saddam was an evil man with whom justice finally caught up. We have inadvertently given the Iraqi people the opportunity, should they take it, to become a free people.     So, The Blog urges you to remember all of this the next time that you say the lives lost were a waste; remember our brave soldiers who died heroically fighting for what they believed in, freedom.
