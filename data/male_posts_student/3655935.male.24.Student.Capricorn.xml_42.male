This has had some good and bad consequences.  Augustine stressed the sovereignty of God and fallenness of human beings, which are important points in Christian theology.  I would much rather see Augustine's general view of these things followed than Pelagius's.  The downside is that when Augustine got something wrong, it has taken thousands of years for the church to recover from his error.  For example, Augustine based his theology of original sin on the Vulgate's incorrect translation of Romans 5:12, which suggested that all humans sinned in Adam.  The Greek text, however, bespeaks a different truth, namely that because of death all sin.  In practice, one big difference in these two views is that Augustine's view requires infant baptism to wash away this original sin of which all people are born guilty.  On these specific doctrines where Augustine's analysis is questionable, Christian theology has struggled to free itself from these mistakes.
