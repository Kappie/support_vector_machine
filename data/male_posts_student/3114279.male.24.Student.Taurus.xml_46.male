      Tomorrow is my only day off.  Next weekend I will have three days off in a row.  I don't know what I will do with myself.  Right now I have no life, so work is becoming my life.  If I were completely trained, I'd even volunteer to work tomorrow.  After next week I'll be pretty much considered trained, or trained enough.  There is a week of training that new employees have to have, but it won't happen until the middle of next month.  Next week I work the evening shift, so I'll get a shift differential.  After next week I can work some overtime, which pays time and a half, which I plan to take advantage of.  I need all the money I can get.  I'm still doing some apartment hunting, and I have a few prospects.  It all depends on what I've got to have up front.  I've got to get my own place.  If I have to, I'll wait another month to get some money saved.  But I'd prefer to be out by the beginning of next month.  Tomorrow is my only day off, so I'm going to call some places.  I know all of this is really boring.  Work today was pretty nice.  I got to take the kids who earned at least 80% of their goal points during the week to a rec room where we watched a movie.  So I got to sit through Spy Kids, which I had never seen, and will be perfectly happy if I never see it again.  I probably could have dozed off, if not for my boss sitting next to me on the couch snoring loudly.  We played some kickball as well.  That's always fun, especially when the kids get competitive.  It's still a little surprising to me (and admittedly somewhat amusing) to hear children yell "Fuck you" at each other; I suppose I'll get desensitized to it eventually.  Tonight I put on Mallrats, which I had never seen, and I fell asleep about midway through.  What I did see was not great.  That's all I've got for today.
