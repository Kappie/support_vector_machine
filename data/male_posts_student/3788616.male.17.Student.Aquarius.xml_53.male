Hee hee, such as? oh... well, such as things like GOD, studies and yup... my love or personal life too...  Heex... ok, let's start with GOD, throughout the whole week, i've been down and out with many problems, except that of meeting Cherie and stuff lah, but basically, was so bothered and pre-occupied by so many things that i realised that i've been neglecting the one person that would really care for me... GOD... yup, He was always there when i needed Him, i told Him everything, He knows everything, confided in Him, yet these days, i just simply ignored His importance and presence in my life except for the times when i needed Him most... However, with church and everything today, i have been made clearer to all everything that is going on around me... Towards friends, people whom i care for dearly and certainly people whom i have feelings for... GOD made all of them, and each of them plays a part in my life, some bigger than the rest but ultimately, everyone is important in my life... especially, people like... nevermind, i shall not continue that sentence... however, to friends out there, i know that many of you are having problems... So, i'll just say that i will be here for you...  To people like Wan Yi, take it easy girl! If things were meant to be, it would be... i will try to help, like Cherie but, that's all i can do, the rest, is up to GOD, in the end, it may not work out, but hey, at least we all tried right? So cheer up and don't let it affect you so much!  To Benjamin, dear pal, we've known each other for quite some time, and naturally, i am quite worried about you... Don't always keep things to yourself, let loose you problems and confide them in your friends, i certainly for one would always be there for you to tell and for advice... Cheer up yeah, don't let it get you down...  To Chris, i guess, of all people, you are the one i misunderstood the most, well... i just want to say sorry 1st, for misunderstanding you with regards to a certain person in my life... but, anyway, i know that you have confusions and am facing a dilemia, however, i wish that you could treat the rest of us more like friends... do share whatever problems with us, we will help, i think it what most of us at church would like to say... ie, Wan Yi, Benjamin and certainly me... but do cheer up and know that your friends are always there for you...  To Shawn, hey man! Cheer up old buddy! Don't let people like her get you down, if she doesn't appreciate you for being such a great person to her, than forget it, there are many of us out there who cares for you, so take solace in that... just remember what everyone has told you before, if she is not worth it, than leave it... do cheer up, and move on with life...  To Gabriel, dude, cheer up! i know how you feel, i've been there and done that, but still, life still carries on... just concentrate on the task at hand ('A's) and everything will fall into place eventually...  To Kelly, thanks for being a great and special person in my life, certainly, i am still confused as to what i am to you... but, i won't let it affect me anymore, i guess, all i am saying is that, though i may still like you, i will leave it to your choice... no, not really giving up on waiting, but rather, just leaving you to be happy... i guess, my consistent whining and stuff, may have put you off, but i just simply hope that you mean that much to me... yup, just wish now that you are happy and would be safe... do take care of yourself yeah, can't bear to see you hurt nor can i bear to see you down and out, irregardless of what reason... study hard! your dreams are still within your grasp! don't overstrain yourself yeah... hmm... yup, can't think of anything else, though i can say that, i will be here for you 24/7,if you ever need anything... i think you know the drill... just take good care of yourself, there's so much to say, yet it's so hard to say and tell you... simply cause, i've no idea, what is going on anymore...  Last but certainly not the least... Cherie... heya! thanks for being such a lovely person in my life... i don't know what else can i say to you, but just simply, keep whatever i said to you a secret between both of us yeah... shared with you some things that i've not told others, so yeah... heex... other than that, will tell you over the cause of time... right now, just want to thank you for being perhaps the nicest and sweetest friend i've had in a long time... yup... heex... erm... don't know what to say lah... but oh yeah! Don't you dare try to get yourself killed while i am still alive! there's so much to live for, i am sure you know that by now... so do take care of yourself and know that i am always there for you! Smile! :p  Oh well... that's that for now, but i can assure to all those friends out there, if they or you ever need help, just simply count on me yeah... i will help you all as best as i can... do take this period of holidays as a time for rejuvination as we gear up towards the promos! Jia you and work hard everyone! :p keep smiles up high in the air and bring out your joy! ('o,')
