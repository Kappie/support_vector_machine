I came across Mozilla Firefox yesterday and it's better than both. It's one of these open source free community browsers from  urlLink Mozilla  and although it's a little buggy, the features it has are just superb. Instead of opening new browser windows for every page, it uses tabs, so you have lots of pages within the same browser window. There's also an excellent search bar and some nifty shortcuts. Ingenious.
