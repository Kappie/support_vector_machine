The more I’ve talked to him, the more I’m convinced my new position is the only position that is consistent with that which I believe.  I’ve been quite a pirate.  I have around 60 GB of music, dozens of DVD movie copies, and around 70 GB of software.  I’ve used Macromedia to make money.  I don’t know how many other programs I’ve cracked for my own use.  So why the change?  Because I realized that not only is piracy wrong, it destroys the pirate.  I wish to live consistent to my own beliefs.  Those beliefs demand that no one has the right to place an unwanted claim against my time or labor.  I own myself, and I answer only to myself and those that I choose to allow claim to me (family and in a more limited sense, friends.).  Just as I demand to own myself, I may make no claim against another man.  I will not own other people, in whole or in part.  Until I find the respect for others, I am false to my own beliefs.  I am less of the man I want to be.  And that clashes with the idea of piracy.  What right do I have to make Bill Gates my slave?  Or Dave Matthews?  What claim do I have upon their work without just compensation?  How can I justify this?  Some say that their piracy is small.  Just one person stealing XP isn’t a big deal.  In the grand scheme of things, it isn’t.  But it harms you for doing it.  By submitting to the desire to own someone else, you are submitting to the idea that people CAN be owned; that it is permissible to seize someone else’s labor for no better reason that ‘I can’.    Some claim that the products cost too much, and somehow this gives you the justification to take from others.  Should you steal a Mercedes because you cannot afford one?  Should you expect to buy groceries according to what you can afford, getting a loaf of bread cheaper than the next man because you make less?  Or do you have the right to just take it, because you can?  The price is the price.  It is fair.  Should the price be too high, then you should not purchase or partake.  Find an alternative, and be consistent with the idea that you own yourself, and you own no one else.  Some just don’t care.  They want all they can get, for their own amusement.  I was like this.  I amassed things I would never use, just because I could.  But there is no justification behind this thievery.  Nothing you can say will justify enslaving other men for your amusement.  You are poisoning yourself by debasing the ideas of freedom.  Maybe you can sleep with that on your head, but you cannot claim to seek freedom so long as you continue to enslave others.  This is going to be hard.  I’ve been taking inventory at home and trying to figure out what I must buy to maintain the computer experience I am accustomed to, and it is going to be very difficult.  But part of being true to your belief means doing the hard thing, even if you don’t have to.  I will be looking at Linux and other alternatives over the next few weeks.  I downloaded iTunes and began to examine what it would take to legitimize the music I wish to have.  It isn’t going to be cheap, and I don’t really have the money to blow on this.  So I will make choices, deleting what I can do without, and even what I wish to keep.  But until I do this, I can’t consider myself complete.  I hope this doesn’t sound ‘high and mighty’ or sanctimonious.  I’m not urging anyone to abandon piracy for my sake.  I’m hoping you examine your own values and decide if piracy is consistent with what you want to be as free men.  Make your own choices.  My purpose here is to explain to myself what I’m doing, and to give you all someone to laugh at in my struggle.
