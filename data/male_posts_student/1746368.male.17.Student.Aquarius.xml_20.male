I plan on using it for bigger purposes than a notebook, but maybe someone will tell you about that later. Most likely it won't be me. Most likely it won't happen at all.  Now that I'm done messing with your heads. I got some root beer while I was there, and then I headed home. I decided that I should probably at least start heading that way.  I don't understand people. Why is anybody mean to anybody in this world? It seems that people generally have enough virtue not to go out and kill someone, but why is that something that could be a problem. If people got along a little bit more than they would have no need. Everyone needs to turn over a new leaf (or maybe two leafs) and just be good. I am probably asking to much.  Well, I'm done pretty much. Now all I have to think of is some witty remark to leave you guys with. Who knows what I will think of next. Eh, guess that's good enough.
