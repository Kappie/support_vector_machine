You might be familiar with it, it's only the longest goddamn series ever to grace the gaming world. That's right, it's the latest Final Fantasy, number 11 in Squaresoft's "Neverending (and totally unrelated) Story." Did you ever watch that movie as a kid? Eh... probably not.   Anyways, this game is dangerous. It needs a friggin warning label. To borrow a phrase from MacHall (a sexcellent comic if there ever was one), "Make sure to plan ahead and make sure you don't have anything you need to get done for a while... like sleep."   The graphics are really good, the commerce system is flawless, and the team play is awesome. However, (and  urlLink Mike  will no doubt disagree with me on this) the menus are a bit cumbersome, the game is slow and at times, extremely diffucult. It also includes the original online RPG dillemma: Go solo and reap the exp benefits with possibility of getting ass kicked, or kick much ass and devide up the exp.  The progress either way is just slow enough to keep your gratification level at a bare minimum, and therefore you'll find yourself thumping monsters on the head as often as is humanly possible to get your daily dose. Of course, all of this could change when I reach a higher level. I can't really speak from an expert's point of view cuz I'm still only level 6 (even after putting about 8 or 9 hours in... see what I mean?). Here's my character:  Race: Tarutaru Level: 6 Job: White Mage Weapon: Ash staff Current spells: Cure, Dia, Banish, Protectra  Sounds lame, eh? Don't worry, Thanksgiving holiday will fix that right up ;)
