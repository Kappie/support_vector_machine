The whole trust thing. She totally got it (of course she would have) and began changing. I am truley amazed at how much she cares...(I really really hope she's truthful about that.) See? Thats what I mean.  If she can't trust me...how can I trust what she says, or does? It just has felt too much like a lie. But I know her love is sincere.  I will wait as long as it takes (or as long as she wants) for her to really trust me. I made it clear to her that regardless of our situation, I would be there for her, because thats just the kind of person I am. I love her too mucho to let something like this bother me though. I've changed. I'm not lingering anymore, and I'm not scared anymore. I understand why she is still slightly atttached to her ex....which I guess is okay. I just thought about it...and regardless of how much you trusted him with yourself, why would you still be attached to him...after all the bad things he's done? I won't bother it though. He's a senior...it will be over soon.  Gotta head out, school time :-/
