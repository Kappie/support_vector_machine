Seemed to be well revieved by City Council members, and was almost a unanimous sweep in passing it as recommednded by our Police Commission. Good for the CPS and great for the employees who will now, (hopefully) get somewhat of a boost in support for projects and initiatives that were put into abeyance for G8, WPC and Y2K. Good for me, because my position, which was never really a sanctioned full time position (until now) will be able to be filled by a civilian with the proper multimedia skillsets necessary to hit the ground running when I leave the CPS in April. Plus there will be some development capital in the kitty for e-learning development for the service. Most excellent.
