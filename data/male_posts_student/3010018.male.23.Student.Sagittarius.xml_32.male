This is by far one of the worst trades in NBA history.....The Lakers are so scared of playing Shaq that they would rather send Shaq to the East rather than get any good players for him....Hey Dr. Buss, have fun with Kobe cause ya'll are gonna be picking #8 in the draft next season....in any case, this all sucks for the Dallas Mavericks who successfully made no decent moves this off season....they sent Antawn Jamison to Washington for crap, Stackhouse, Laettner, and whatever else.....and then they managed not to get Shaq....great job there Cuban....oh and we lost our starting point guard and got nothing for him....Now Steve Nash has alot of mileage on him but we still needed him....and Derek Fisher was available and we managed to not get him too....and rumor has it that Dampier is headed to the Knicks...soooo the Mavs have done NOTHING to help themselves while the Spurs and Rockets got better...So the Mavs are gonna be nowhere near an NBA championship....  NFL - Eddie George is asking to be released from the Titans.....Cowboys need a running back, Jones  Parcells please go after Eddie, you could split his carries with Julius Jones and have a great locker room presence......  MLB - Rangers are doing well, which is wonderful especially since we managed to get rid of the $250 million man and the team is on top of the baseball world, well next to the Yankees.....and did anyone see the eruption of Carlos Zombrano at the Cardinals-Cubs game the other night ? He hit Edmonds twice in one game, the hell was his problem....and speaking of eruptions David Ortiz of the cursed BoSox threw 2 baseball bats at umpires.....ya, suspension ? like 10 games at least....  Ok those are my sports thoughts for the day........
