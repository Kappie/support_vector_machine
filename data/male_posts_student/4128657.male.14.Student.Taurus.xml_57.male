It is very creamy and light.The consistency seems to be like cool whip. It seems almost like cotton candy. It is very difficult to make an ice cream cone with, because it is so sticky. We like the flavor and it is not sticky to eat. We have finished one carton of vanilla and we are now trying neopolitan.
