So I've just returned from the Doctor's office wherein I was informed that I do indeed have strep throat again and this time, them tonsils, they gots to go. Great. More surgery.  As of right now I sit here with the following  A headache A mouthful of spit, cause it hurts to swallow A sore throat (duh) A pair of swollen glands on my throat The feeling of some ghostly amorphous hand reaching through my person and squeezing each joint as if it would yeild the blessed fluid of life and a bottle of antibiotics which should apparently make me better.  I now need to go and manufacture some sort of lunch through the consumption of which I shall find both sustinence and the time to take the aforementioned pills.  Then I'm going to hit myself in the head with a rock until consciousness flees from me like any poor sap who finds himself wandering alone in the first few minutes of any episode of Law  Order: Criminal Intent.
