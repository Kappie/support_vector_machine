The semi-final featured the Portugal team scoring 2-1 including their own goal, anyone try to say that Holland are rubbish will have to take it out with me cause it might not have been their best match but they played well for me. My star player of all time Stam was my "Man of the match" as his defencive help was solid and didn't let anyone down as usual. He was backing up players, clearing the ball, everything that a great defender like him should do. He's been great throughout. Holland shouldn't worry though, they always make it to the semi's so that's great. They fought through hard times to get here but somehow the Portugal team won. I respect how the Ducth beat Latvia coming 2nd, great outcome.  I was hoping the Dutch did well, they did well, made me proud and never let me down. You guys did excellent, now it's the World Cup ! You will do it !
