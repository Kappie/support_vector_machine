I looked into it and it turns out that it works. There is this website called  urlLink http://windowsmobiletraining.com . When you go there you register, take courses, and get points. If you get 1500 points you can exchangei t for a copy of Windows XP Pro... with FREE SHIPPING no less! I was stoked. It said it will take about 8 weeks, probably becasue of such high demand. Now... my ownly worry is... will it come at all. I'll keep you guys updated when I find out.
