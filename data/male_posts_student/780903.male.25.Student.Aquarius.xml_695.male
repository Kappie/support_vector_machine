Since we know it isn't possible for Republicans to believe in good will toward men or charitable activities, the reason must be that Republicans are blood sucking vampires."  Re-reading my post, I admit it wasn't clear what exactly I was implying -- but really the observation I wanted to make was why *any* political-minded organization -- right, left, or whatever direction anyone else is -- would be sponsoring the Blood Drive.  Like if the Environmental Law Society sponsored a conference on diversity.  It's not a *bad* thing of course; it just doesn't seem to have a heck of a lot to do with what they do.  But I suppose it could have been read in a bad way, so I've got no problem with the comment -- just thought I'd clarify.
