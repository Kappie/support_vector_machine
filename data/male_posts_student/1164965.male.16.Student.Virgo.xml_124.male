Mrs VA introduced the book by telling us that the Bundren family was simply unintelligent ("really stupid," i think she said) but i've come to a different understanding of them. (No offense to Mrs VA - I was just using you as a handy introduction-type idea). Anse is the only person in the book who strikes me as truley stupid, but i think his stupidity comes from his country stubborness and pride. The rest of them are pretty much just pure crazy as opposed to dumb. Cash pulls through in the end as the sanest of the bunch - too bad his leg is rotted off. I think that Darl's developement is very interesting; his narrations retain some of his characteristic vocabulary, but he is badly cracked by the end. And i see what you're saying (Rob) about Vardaman's run on excitement, but i think it runs right on through to insanity. (conclusion)  -Beck-
