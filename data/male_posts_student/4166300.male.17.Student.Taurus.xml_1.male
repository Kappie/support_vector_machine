I've been keeping myself content eating boxes of triscuits and doing this blog crap.  It's beginning to become very therapeutic, I've always wanted a place to complain about things.  I lost my USMA candidate number and password, so I'm pretty much shafted unless I want to go crawling to my MALO begging for him to bail me out.  I intent on floating lethargically through Sunday in a symbiotic relationship with my rack.  No church Monty?  Oh well, I'm going to hell anyway. Me, Hitler, Charlie Manson and Beelzebub can get a poker game together every other Friday.  I think I'll go to CenterStall and watch BJ Hall bring the pain over and over until breakfast time.
