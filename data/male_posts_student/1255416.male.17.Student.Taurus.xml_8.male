The last couple weeks have been mighty stressful...damn Ap ests and classes coming to their culmination.  I've actually gotta get up early tomorrow (a wednesday) and go to a review for AP chem, I've got two pages of notes for next year's CX topic that need fact checking and finding-cards-for (also known as randomly looking for quotes by famous-sounding people that say things i want them to say...but that should be done mostly at camp.  I jsut need background info).  The big news i referred to in my last post was asking lisa lewis to prom, sadly she said no.  Oh well.  Such is life.  Been having a good time fo it though, went up to the mountains with matt last ngiht, which was really freaking fun.  Had a nice long conversation with him, which was really nice, I really miss the whole rediculously long converastion thing that you coudl have with people while hiking.  Ahh, Cheley...  Again, what are you gonna do.  I'm getting an application from Steve Oskjay to get a job at this media research place soon, hwich should get me some pocket change, hopefully.  I've also been looking at school's...I really need good board scores is what it comes down to...damn not having good enough grades for the cream of the crop, fucking you miss bratun.  Sorry for the haphazard writing style of this entry, I'm listening to Ben folds and typing a lot faster than i normally do and it's causing me to not really think aobut wha ti'm writing.  Yay spew!  I have one real goal for this summer: find a girl who's interesting, intelligent, (hopefully) attractive, and who's attracted to me...that needs to be done...soon.  Damn life.  OKeydoke, that came out a little weird, whatever, talk to you all later.  Sorry for the spelling and grammar, whatever
