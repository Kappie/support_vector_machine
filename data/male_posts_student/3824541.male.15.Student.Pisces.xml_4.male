You might wonder how come I'm shrugging this off, and why I'm about to talk about to cry about Florida again when two lives were lost today. First of all, I can only remember meeting the lady once. The memory is of me standing by her, and I'm eating fruity pebbles. The other reason is that she hated my mom, and wanted nothing to do with my family. The final reason? Her and my uncle got a divorce like six years ago. So, I mean, not that it's no big deal, but it didn't really hit me.   So, my mom found out about me using the computer all the time. I'm not suppossed to be on it unless she turns it on for me; I've been grounded from it since February. She said she's disappointed. Sorry ma :(, but I need to type my blog. How else would people keep up with this drama and excitement? *Writes down he has to make another 'blah my life sucks 'cause I'm not in Florida post'*   I wish I were with my friends in FL :(   Blah. Today I realized that I must be the second silliest person ever. I'm just so silly. Silly :D! I got mad at Bobby and Brittney, but I wasn't really that mad so I fake a big fight. At the end I went "I'm obnoxious" and laughed at them. Take that conformity.   So, here I am.  -Dan    .Music   Yellowcard - Only One  Sugarcult - Killing Me  Story of the year - Sidewalks   Sugarcult - Daddy's little defect   Did you find this one? If you did than I'll tell you two more things. I changed what it says when someone leaves a comment; find that on your own. Second of all, the red means that the post title came from a lyric in that song.
