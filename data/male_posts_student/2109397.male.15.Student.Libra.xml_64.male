And I asked her at like 5 when I was supposed to meet everyone at 530 and the only reason she was takin me was cuz I was supposed to get a free pass from one of our season pass holders but they fucked up and forgot that they only work on certain days. So i asked if I could go anyways and she was like "Well how much is it!?!?" So since I had to pay now she decided she needs to look through her big huge folder of coupons to see if there is one for KY Kingdom. And of course she sits there and stuies every coupon so in turn it ends up being her sorting al of her coupons to see which ones she will need. So I start bitching at her and shes like shut up im not at your beckon call. You fucking told me you would take me bitch. So then she wants to figure out if htey have a night admission price and she was like call them up! And I say hell naw bitch and so that ended that. Until bout half an hour later she decided she'll call. Then I say it's too fucking late anyways. And shes like ok then we wont go. Stupid ass bitch does not know how to make a fucking decision to save her life.  My dad keeps lecturing me on the same shit and I'm thinkin hey I've heard this before like 7 times DIDNT WORK THEN WONT WORK NOW DIPSHIT. He says I need to go to summer school to have the teacher be there so it can help me, when eskool would help me do my homework because that is wht the fucking shit is.   So yea there you go for another shit day.
