He was the democrat who inspired people to vote democrat for their entire lives.  You can still find older people who cling to the party of FDR for no other reason than FDR himself.  I've come to believe that FDR was one of the most damaging, destructive presidents we've ever endured.  His explosion of the federal government echoes to this day through social security and the New Deal created the era of entitlement.  He did more to trample the tenth ammendment than any other president.  Not to mention the court packing scheme!  I'm not up to a complete dissection of FDR this morning, but I wanted to at least point out the Sowell column.  Another case where popular perspective is really little more than a myth that cannot withstand close scrutiny.
