The atmosphere was really good most of the time. I saw so many of my favourite bands... about 15 or something. In total I saw Arch Enemy, Breed 77, Cradle of Filth, DamagePlan, Dillinger Escape Plan, Ill Nino, Linkin Park, Machine Head, Metallica, Monster Magnet, Opeth, Slayer, Slipknot, Soulfly, Sum 41 and The Distillers. How many good bands is that?! Arch Enemy were incredible, it was pretty damn violent though. Some guy jumped about 20 foot into the crowd, but nobody caught him! Shame. Breed 77 were good as always. Cradle of Filth's stage presence was amazing. They had these women on stage doing some weird tricks/dancing on a rope! Quite amazing. DamagePlan... oh my GOD. Incredible. Quite possibly my favourite performance. They played 'Walk' by Pantera at the end of the set. I was secretly hoping they would play a Pantera song all along. Dillinger weren't bad... very good opener. Ill Nino... nothing new. Seen them guys twice before and the show at Download was just the same except the sound equiptment was really bad. Linkin Park were actually really good too. Chester looks pretty evil in real life. They played very well and really interacted with the crowd... I enjoyed it. I didn't see much of Machine Head... I saw them play 'Imperium' and I left. I have seen them before so I didn't really miss anything new. Metallica were excellent. They played their whole set with Joey Jordison of Slipknot and Dave Lombardo of Slayer because something happened to Lars. I am actually glad. How many people can say they watched Metallica play a set with members of Slipknot and Slayer?! It made it so much more memorable! Sadly, they didn't play 'Master of Puppets', 'One' or 'Welcome Home' (some of my favourite tracks) because their set got cut short because they had to decide on a drummer from Machine Head, Slayer, Life of Agony, Hatebreed and Slipknot. They took their time choosing! Monster Magnet were... weird. Completely not my thing in the slightest. Opeth were pretty good. Not heard much about them but a lot of people say they're good. They have good contrast of heavy and mellow with a blend of folk. Slayer were really good, they sliced through their set flawlessly! Kerry King is a demon, I swear to GOD! They had to play in a tent though, 'cause they turned up about 3 hours late. Slipknot were amazing... my favourite performance. They played a mixture of songs from 'Slipknot', 'Iowa' and the new album, 'Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses'. They are so insane... constantly running around the stage and headbanging. Incredible. Soulfly were really good too but I was really tired and in pain due to over-the-top sunburn. They played 'Roots... Bloody Roots' which was incredible! So energetic. Sum 41 were actually very good too. I'm one of the only people who think their riffs are really good. They played Metallica's 'Master of Puppets' and a R.A.T.M. song. I watched The Distillers from really far back and watched them purely out of boredom - nothing else. The whole weekend was just a constant flow of alcohol and live performances. Amazing. I actually forgot a duvet and a pillow so I had to sleep on a crappy little mat thing clothed! Mandy got a duvet the next day but it was so crap. It was really thin and really fluffy. I woke up covered in fluff. But every night Chris and I went on 'treasure hunts' and found so much alcohol! On Friday night I found about 5 cans of lager! On Saturday night I found only 2 and found none on the Sunday night but made up for it on the Monday morning. I woke up at about 8.00am and went for a walk and found 12 cans of Carlsberg, and next to that, an UNOPENED 24-can crate of lager! So I kind of took it home. How amazing is that? I come home with more beer than I went with! And I drank all of the cans I took! That's pretty damn impressive. We also found some fold up chairs, a throw-away BBQ, some Mini Cheddars and some other random crap. I got home at about 11.30pm that day. I had to spend 7 hours at a bus station and I was so knackered. I actually fell asleep on a bench! Anyway, I am done babbling about Download now. I had an amazing weekend! Roll on next year!
