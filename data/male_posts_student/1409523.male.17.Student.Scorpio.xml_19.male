(at least lately it has been like this) which is simple, no work, effortless....that is what school should be... not some bullshit about stuffing your schedule with activities so colleges think you are well rounded... taking ap. courses cause they are harder and you look more motivated... and then balancing these two things... which usually means many hellish 3:30 nights ... then trying to survive the day after .. and pay attention in class.. and be social... thats not what high school is supposed to be about.... thats what my life was reduced to for a few months back there ... finally i can sort of relax and enjoy the good points of high school.....actually... i shouldn't be talking.. i have a shit load of projects on the way... and well ... its ok though.. my middle name is Procrastinate... whatever... back to vegging out .... i will write later...!
