I thought it was one of my sister's friends just goofin off but I noticed that a couple times I recognized the numbers. It's not like Lauren Monroe to send prank calls. The next came in and it was her so I picked up really quickly to listen to Lauren in tears. I wasn't sure of what to say but she explained that her boyfriend Kenyon had yelled at her for goin to the movies with jay on Friday. He called her a couple names which I dare not say. But It really didn't get started until she called jay. jay who just as close to her as I am flipped out and went looking for the SOB. My thought was that Jay shouldn't have gotten that angry and that's why Lauren called. She didn't want jay to go after him. I called the guys together so we could find jay and stop him before he did something stupid. Me,Mike and Nick went looking for jay we tried to call his cell, used the GPS thing his dad but on the Bentley hoping to find him. We went all over West Orange and couldn't find him. I was running through Essex Green Square when Lauren called mike and told him that Kenyon was back at her house tryin to apologize. We had never driven so fast before, as we were turning onto her street a silver Mercedes cut us off and we knew almost immediately it was jay. Jay jumped out his car and ran into the house. We pulled up and we could hear Lauren screaming STOP at the top of her lungs. I was the first in the house and the first thing I did was take jay by the arms and hold him back. That put everything on hold and it seemed like the problem was about to end but I was wrong. Kenyon reached over and hit jay in the face while I was holdin him. Lauren was mad about this and slapped Kenyon across the  face saying get out. This is where it got bad. Kenyon pushed Lauren to the ground and my temper took over. It's like a blur when I think of it now but I jumped forward and Kenyon ended up against the wall and I literally watched his face swell up as I kept stinging his head with my fists. Eventually the guys pulled me off and Kenyon ran out and drove home. Everyone came to my house and Lauren thanked me by helping me ice my hands. That's an experience I might never forget and one I might come to regret.
