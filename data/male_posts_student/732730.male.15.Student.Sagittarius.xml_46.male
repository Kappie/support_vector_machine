I did N-O-T-H-I-N-G) he started whinging about me. "You don't talk enough", "we have nothing in common", rah rah rah. He keeps making it sound like he's too good for me. Which, in some ways, is true. He's really good looking, and popular (sometimes!) and outgoing (sometimes!). But, if he put any other mere mortal male or female through the shit he's out me through (trying to top himself, "apart time", sooky Sue mode, whinging and whining) he'd be gone!  I don't know why I even answered the phone when he called me... I've been happy ever since I stopped talking to him. I think I'm gonna stop!  Ya know, he said he loved me, and that made me feel all warm on the inside. But now, he can be a cock (well, he has for a while, and I noticed, and now I feel liberated) and I'm sick of it.  GO me!
