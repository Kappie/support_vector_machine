It's not something that can just be picked up and toyed with, and then put down again; it's one of those things that actually sends out these strange creepers into the soil of your mind. Those black and white stones, the strange formations they make that are so familiar once you've played for a while. One finds oneself constructing them when walking to and fro.  It is a game that I am constantly rediscovering and allowing to fall into disuse, but have picked up again, this time with the intention of making it a serious hobby. There are books that can be bought (and need to be!) to enable improvement.  Should anyone need me, I can be found in KGS under the name Harlequin:   urlLink Kiseido
