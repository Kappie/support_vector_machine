All day my lazy ass has been sitting here, and I've been doing nothing but playin video games, filling up on soda, and surfin the net for pointless shit. This is what I call a good day. A real milestone.  Although it might not seem like I'm in a good mood when you talk to me, I'm actually really happy. School's drawing to a close, and I get to just be a lazy bastard today.   Right now? No reason to be openly pissed.  A friend of mine was telling me about this crush, and he's a crazy bastard too. He likes her, not the other way around, cause he's like that eerie kid you don't talk to, cause you think he's gonna mug you or something. It's great, he like unintentionally freaks everyone out that he comes in contact with. I wanna like ask him if he has a mental issue.   Anyways, I'm gonna go wander around on the internet again, Later.
