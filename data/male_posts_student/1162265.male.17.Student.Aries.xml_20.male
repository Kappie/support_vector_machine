I really don't know why.  My father has just left for Texas for the week, to take some class on something.  I'm not sure what it actually is, but it'll be a relief not to have to deal with his insane amount of nagging, and nagging and nagging.  Oh, and also in the world of reality Swim season is only four more days for me!  That's only two more practices!  Then I'll be free to procastinate even more, and lose my wonderfully sexy, well toned, body that I've worked so hard to get.  Even though, I still don't have giant pecks (My chest is like a damn piece of paper) , or how ever that's spelled.   Ummm.....  Ga.
