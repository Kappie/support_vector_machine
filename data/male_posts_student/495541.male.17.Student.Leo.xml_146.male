We are on our way, my Dad and I, to Kirkwood to the practice gym.  I've never been to Kirkwood, so yeah that was ok.  Practice was alright, nothing to fancy.  Yelled at and stuff like normal.  I was kind of mad a bit during practice.  I don't know, I normally am.  I think I was  just a bit pissed about the game.  And about the technical -- Will gets suspended.  I think he might have said something, but I don't know.  When coach Green asked Tyler and I about it before we started practice I said I didn't know and didn't notice anything.  I'm not sure if anyone else said anything to him about it.  I just have no idea why he decided to pick Will to blame it on.  Anyways, after practice we went back to Kennedy and lifted weights.  Got done with that, and went home.  Took a shower and went off to the DOT office to get my license.  Woo ya!  I didn't have to take a test.  Boo ya.  Alright.  So yeah I'm cool with my Mazda 626.  After that I hung out at home and slept a bit.  Then Whit and I went over to the mall and we got Super Mario 3.  Woooooo!   It's meeeee Mario!  Aahahhah.  That is hilarious.  We played some Tetris, some Jeopardy, which I sucked at.  The only ones I knew the answer for, I spelt out the answer wrong.  Arrggggh.  We played the Mario.  I sucked at that too, but it was fun.  Then we played some Techmo Super Bowl.  That game is tight.  I kicked ass in that.  I even beat Scott   who is really good at it?  Well I guess not, cos I beat him.  Whooopty doo!  Yeah then Maria arived and we hung out then we picked up Brian and headed over to Pizza Ranch where Peglow works and had some nice pizza there.  It was pretty good.  Most pizza I eat eventually gives me an upset stomach, but this did not.  So that was good.  There were also a few weird people eating there also.  One guy who we thought was about to steal some chairs, but did not.  Then oh, he gets a phone call and Maria acts like she's answering it when she doesn't even have a phone in her hand.  Nice move, then the guy looks at us funny and looks like he's about to murder us all (not really! Ha ha!).  Anyways then we all went over to my house to play Xbox.  That's pretty much when I took over because I cannot be stopped in NBA  Live.  Don't believe Whit when she leaves a comment and says she really beat me because she didn't.  So yeah that was about it.  I had fun!  That is about it.  Good night.
