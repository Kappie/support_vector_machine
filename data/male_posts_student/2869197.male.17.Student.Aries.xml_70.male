I feel I didn't do enough, didn't serve well enough, didn't say enough last time. In short, I failed as a missionary. I still can't speak or even preach, but at least I can work. We will be building an addition to the church down there, and menial physical work is my forte. Pray for me, friends (if you exist, that is).  I like the cut of Calvin's jib. You hear how he has a low view of human nature, but they forget to mention that he has a proportionally high view of God's gifts to us so that we shine as a reflection of that God. I shall be bringing the first book with me to Mexico as a "light read" hehe.  I'm beginning to tire of all this good literature. By this I mean, Calvin's Institutes and Dosteovsky's Brothers are incredibly good and passionate but also incredibly hard to read. My mind swims in their greatness, unable to comprehend it all. I need some good, low thought science fiction to clean my mind. Maybe some Isaac Asimov or RA Salvatore.
