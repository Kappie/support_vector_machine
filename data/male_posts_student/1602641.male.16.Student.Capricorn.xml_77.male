Like seriously, I for one, was under the impression the Ronald Reagan was already dead, he hasn't contributed much to society since he was officially classified as an old fart, unlike Jimmy Carter with the house-building and shit...The fact of the matter is: It's just too hard to keep up the reputations--Either we all have to die or we have to account for the tremendous backlog in recognition to the reformers of the present.
