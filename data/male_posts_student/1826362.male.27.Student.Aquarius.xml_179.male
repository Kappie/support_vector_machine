Sinai oysters", after rocky mountain oysters), and the charoset.  I even liked the gefilte fish, which is strange because I don't really like fish in general.  Everyone was really nice; heather's family rocks.  After dinner all the men went outside and smoked cigars.  From this limited experience, I think I rate passover right up there with thanksgiving as my favorite holidays.
