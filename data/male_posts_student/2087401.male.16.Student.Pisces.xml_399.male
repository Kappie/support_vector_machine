JONAH: NO ITALICIZING THE TEMPLATE, IT COULD MALFUNCTION AND ITALICIZE EVERY SINGLE POST ON THE BLOG, DUE TO AN ERROR IN HTML CODE.  NO ITALICIZATION UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.  We now return you to your regular case broadcasting.  Jonah: Also, I didn't get an e-mail. Don't you like me? Also Also*, James Band?   Also the Statute of Limitations** starts today, the new template (courtesy of Thomas) can be entered 21 March 2004. Also new additional good sense Template Rule: The person who entered the template identifies themselves in a post, so that no one can hog the template for two weeks in a row. Thomas has it this week, we'll randomly choose next week.   * Yes I meant to double the Alsos. ** Sports Night Reference! It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!
