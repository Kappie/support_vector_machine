Being inTERRORgated just kind of ruins your day. The stupid fucks left their evidence case at my house too. Have been kind of paranoid as to if there is a bug in it recording ever incriminating thing we say  ...Drawing of an ameoba on really cool paper Silvanie gave to me. The pic doesn't do the paper justice. In person, it hurts your eyes to look at.
