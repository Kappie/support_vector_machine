Just look at how the Toyota and Honda corporations do better than our Ford and Chevy in America... we can't compete. Our cars break down every two weeks and you get about $4000 as compared to about $10000 for a Japanese car. Look at Playstation... why us? Well now, we are getting "OWNED" in the EATING DEPARTMENT! We had a 400 pound guy lose to this Japanese midget... how? Read on about this "PWN493"...      Kobayashi Sets Record for Hot Dog Eating  1 hour, 7 minutes ago  By LUKAS I. ALPERT, Associated Press Writer  NEW YORK - When it comes to eating hot dogs, "The Tsunami" still blows everybody away. For the fourth straight year, rail-thin Takeru Kobayashi chewed up the competition at the Nathan's Famous hot dog eating competition Sunday, breaking his own previous world record.  Kobayashi, 26, of Nagano, Japan, gulped down 53 1/2 wieners in 12 minutes and shattered his own world record by three dogs. In 2002, he had wolfed down 50 1/2.  The closest competitor Sunday was newcomer Nobuyuki Shirota, 25, of Tokyo, who made an impressive showing but couldn't cut the mustard with 38 downed dogs.  Once again, then, the contest's coveted Mustard Yellow Belt returns to Japan. Since 1996, the Japanese have       ted the competition and only one American — New Jersey's Steve Keiner in 1999 — has captured the belt at the signature July 4 extravaganza.  The 5-foot-7, 132-pound Kobayashi, of Nagano, Japan, employed his trademark method of snapping the dogs in half before swallowing them to destroy the 19 other contestants.  Meanwhile, 105-pound Sonya "The Black Widow" Thomas, 36, of Alexandria, Va., could relish two new records: She ate more hot dogs — 32 — than any other woman and any other American in the contest's history.  Eric "Badlands" Booker, a 6-foot-4, 400-pound subway conductor from Long Island who came in fifth with 27 dogs, said he and the other competitive eaters were determined to unseat the Japanese.  "We aren't going to stop until we bring the belt back," he told ESPN.   Kobayashi seemed unworried.  "I will come back next year and try and break the record once again," he said.      Wow... how are we going to stop getting "PWN3D" by these guys? They're too good... that's more than 10,000 calories! I'd die... but why are we fighting with low people like Iraqis? The Japs are the real threat... just kidding... but I'm tired of the "PWN493"! Let's get workin' America!
