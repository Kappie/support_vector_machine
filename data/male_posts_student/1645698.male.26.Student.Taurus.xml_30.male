Anyway, if we're back to songs..well, I have a bunch to choose from, like this one (I got Dollface to like it recently):    Nirvana - Son of a Gun  Up up up and down Turn turn turnaround Round round roundabout And over again Gun gun son of a gun You are the only one Makes any difference what I say  (x2) The sun shines in the bedroom When we play The raining always starts When you go away  Up up up and down Turn turn turnaround Round round roundabout And over again Gun gun son of a gun You are the only one Makes any difference what I say  (x2) The sun shines in the bedroom When we play The raining always starts When you go away  Up up up and down Turn turn turnaround Round round roundabout And over again Gun gun son of a gun You are the only one Makes any difference what I say  (x4) The sun shines in the bedroom When we play The raining always starts When you go away  (Originally by the Vaselines)     Apart from that, I realized, I've lost my mind. I've recently been trying to learn about astrophysics, (specifically regarding orbital bodies eccentricities and other weird crap like that), other stuff about astronomy...and Maltese...I will never make it, and I doubt I'll learn what I remember. I  gotta go back to other stuff I started but never finished learning, like all those languages I though I could learn at the same time. Boy was I wrong, I'll probably try again when I'm not so lazy. P.S.,  Aus Gamers? sounds German. (Out Gamers)  I'm Deadinse...and that'll never happen!  "Me dijo un señor, una vez, un señor de parecido de sabio, pero con vida de portero, que aquellos quienes buscan por un sentido muy profundo en lo que piensan, se torturan, y se atormentan sobre lo que no merece tanto análisis. Cuando le pregunté, 'Señor, ¿cómo es que un anciano, tal como su merced, sepa tanto, de semejante cosa?' Me respondió con, 'Hijo...como crees vos, ¿que terminé yo así?'"
