He's practically a European, he loves fine food, he's a wine expert, he has EXTREMELY expensive taste in things like cars, houses and furniture, and he has this great social laugh/chuckle thing. Oh, and my cousin Alan (the one you're all going to meet) thinks so too. So there!         Muahahaha, I love my family....... *gag*
