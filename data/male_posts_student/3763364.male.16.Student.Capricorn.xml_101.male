I had this thought in my head, at 2 am last night, I thought for a second, I thought that I could make all the pain go away, and achieve what I had always wanted. Of course, I had hope, I had this OPTIMISM that everyone keeps on raving about. And, of course, my hope was shattered.  I still, in some small, miniscule way, think that there is a chance that we can be together. 1:1000000 odds is still a chance, is it not?  I saw The Villiage today. An interesting thing caught my attention.  William Hurt's character said this:   "The world stops for love. The world falls to it's knees in it's prescence."     The world hath not stopped for me. Nobody had.   Still, I am perplexed. After what I did, do I even DESERVE her? Even as a friend? How could I possibly believe that we could be together. After all this time, after all this rejection, after all this hardship, what made me think that there was a feasable chance?  Desperation.  I got braces today. I have a face full of steel, and now all I can taste is blood.  I don't even have beauty anymore.   I have to have her love. I can't let even a miniscule chance go to waste. If even for one second, I lose that chance, and opportunity arises, I will never forgive myself. I can never look at another woman. I can never be with another woman.  I remember the last time I tried to fall out of love with her. The last time I tried to fall out of love with her I nearly blew my head off.
