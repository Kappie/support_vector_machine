Besides nothing spectacular has been happening recently anyway. Ill just give a small update of my last post.   After the dust settled on the football field, the final match between 5a and p2 ended with a 2-0 score. Quite surprising really since p2 had practically dominated their first 2 games.   I took 2 days off school after pulling my leg muscles so i ended up having a 4 day weekend from thursday to sunday. =D   Someone found Dom's wallet so he got it back although all the money and cards inside were missing except for his IC.    School has been a real drag of late and im not sure why... Maybe its because ive been having overseas relatives staying with me so my whole routine has been disrupted.I had 2 cousins and an aunt staying with me from saturday to sunday and after that another 3 relatives took over from monday towednesday.. So for about 3 nights i was sleeping on the floor in my parents room... It was certainly not comfortable andhaving to get up for school the next morning didnt help matters while in school i just dozed during and in between lessons. Robyn slumping down on the table beside me every now and then also did not help me stay awake either. My whole class has been rushing to finish their seni folio and robyn has been no exception. Thank goodness i dropped seni !! ^^v Even without seni i still havnt been able to escape doing any projects though... moral project has been a real pain in the arse for me. i know everyone tells me that its so easy to write about but i just cant seem to think of anythin to write down. Its even more annoying having to take pictures doing some stupid thing like cleaning the windows or mopping the floor. As of now im still looking for someone to help me print out my pictures. Im supposed to pass up the project tomorrow. Doesnt look like ill be able to do that now....  Everyone got back their report cards today. As expected not everyone is happy with their results this time. With less then a 100 days to go before spm, the feeling to just curl up and hide grows biggerand bigger. Thinking about what im going to be doing after november is very nice, but then i snap back to reality and realize theres still that great divide to cross which is spm... sigh why cant exams just be a breeze for me..? why cant i be like some who can have all the fun they want and still bring back good results...? Sighh i guess i should be contented with what i have and am given, as the verse in the bible goes :- "Godliness with contentment is great gain".  For those who have not watched King Arthur yet, Pls!! Go watch it!! To me its worth it just to see Keira as Guinevere shooting some Saxons dead with her bow.. but thats just my opinion. =P Seriously though the movie is really worth watching although of course the battles arent as big and wild as LOTR. But what would u expect to see when u have only about6 knights and a bunch of woodmen defending a whole fortress...? Not exactly going to get to see something similar to the seige of Gondor are we..? I also think that they could have shown more on Lancelot while he was growing up and training with Arthur and the rest. But at the end i give King Arthur 4 and a half stars out of 5.one star solely becoz Keira is in it... =P
