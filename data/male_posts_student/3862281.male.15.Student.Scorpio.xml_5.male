I know he remembers the times when I actively showed how much I hated him and displayed it constantly. I see him smile whenever I am hurt or when he attempts to inflict pain on me himself, unfortunately he doesn't (and never will) govern any power over me, making his efforts futile and worthless but nonetheless I see his attempts at hurting people, I listen as he insults his own 'friends' behind their backs, I see how he hasn't yet forgotten all the smallest things that have been done onto him. And for no reason too, he leads a full and relatively happy life as far as I've seen, it's always easy to see if anyone is truly hurt just by their eyes, the eyes always betray the mind, there's nothing behind his eyes but unreasonable malice and greed. He hides behind others to give him power, his mother (a formidable figure I assure you) has dealt out pain in his service many times before. He deserves to be told exactly what it is to suffer, he's deserving of death.
