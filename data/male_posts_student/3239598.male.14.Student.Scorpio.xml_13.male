JEEZ! *walks and sits down at computer looking very annoyed and disheveled, while laura glares angrily at him from across the room*  It's been *checks calendar* 1 month and 2 days since i have written in my nice blog *pats* and i am only writing in here because SOME PEOPLE *glares in the direction of Wyndemere and Laura's house* are nagging me to do so.  I don't really have anything to do/say.  It's the summer! WHEE! My baseball teams SUCKS! What else is new... we're 3-13.  BUT! I am good, the best if I may say so, so it'll be all better next year when I'm on a (hopefully) better team.  I'm all alone, DemiB is at her cheerleading camp *gags*, and DemoB and friend along with mother dearest are at that pool thing.  Have I recently mentioned that I HATE CHEERLEADING???  Whoo!! I just blew a bunch of shit up on that video game! And, my hot pocket's done! *goes to retrieve* OK.. well I'm gonna go mug some people on MobWar.com... bye, y'all!
