I haven't seen him in like 5 years, but he was really sad and didn't feel like talking because his dad died of brain cancer. :-( Lee (the dad) was really cool and we all hung out and im sorry that he passed away. he was a good man. well thats all with that.   Today in science we watched a Earth Day movie. It tested us on how much we know about earth day and i scored really high! YA!!! lol. well during 5th hour we watched the senate candidate speeches to see who we are gonna vote for for next year. im not voting though because we have to register to vote. we have to go see a teacher and give her our ID card, to be able to vote. i lost mine. lol. no one really cares and only a handfull of students registered lol.   in english we're almost done watching a movie called the heat of the night and in math we are doing postulates! its really gay. thats about all for today. see you later!
