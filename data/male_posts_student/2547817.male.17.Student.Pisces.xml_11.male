I had only 2hrs and 6mins of sleep last night. Then, I rushed to church with a running nose. Sang at service for the Lord. I tried my best. He's happy, I think.  After the game of survivor, some of us stayed at Leon's place. It's nice, his place with white exterior, well kept, and with pretty purple orchids in moss-covered charcoal. I might be dangerous, all that dampness. I love my U.W.C. friends. Well, almost all of them. The girls are almost perfect and the boys are quite alright too. Don't worry, I'm asking myself the same question as you are right now, "What the hell am I doing there?" right?  However, often enough, I find "STIMULATING, interlectual jargon" unappealing and monotonous. Some of it interests me occasionally, and getting it weekly or fortnightly or monthly is fine. It's nice t be able to talk to people who can talk back. We had fun.  I'm confused, tired and depressed. I require maintenance.
