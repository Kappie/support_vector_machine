Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Everytime -Britney Spears Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #15 As with any Britney Spears single, “Everytime” has some lurking, indescribable quality that makes it easy to be drawn into; the song sounds like it's constantly on fade effect, delicately losing breathe until an end both dead and newborn. Neither the production nor the vocals are on a platform, unlike a  Christina  ballad (check the sickly wails throughout “A Voice Within”) or previous Britney singles (check the stop-and-start, volume shifting “Sometimes”). Audibly defining loneliness, the piano, harp and bongo arrangement meshes with Britney’s whispered soliloquy (an instrument of its own) and is thinned with awakening strings and quivering echoes. Regardless of the mediocrity of  In the Zone  or any paparazzi blitz on the nouveau beau, Britney’s ’04 singles have become surprisingly addictive, mainly due to their mood-shifting abilities. Take “Toxic,” for example, which could persuade even the most conservative into prostitution, and now “Everytime,” which could depress the clown’s jester. That convincing power is simultaneously breathtaking and dangerous; hell, if you shuffle a Brit playlist and end up mouthing “Toxic” and “Everytime” back to back, you may end up keeping both  Viagra  and  Prozac  in business.  T he Verdict:  8.4/10 - The Fork   (4.2/5)     2004 Bubble Singles Club Entry
