I saw pictures on the news of what looks like Seal teams on the New York underground.  The question for me is this: where, if anywhere, will they strike. It could only really be Britain or America, but which?  Britain is the only country of the coalition which has not yet been hit by Al-Qaeda. Are we to be punished for our comparitive apathy? Certainly a terror attack on London would be easy to organise and quite catastrophic and, to be frank, it is our turn.  But on the other hand, Al-Qaeda could mock America's paranoia and hit her again. America is also more hated than Britain, since she is the main protagonist in the coalition, and Camp Delta still exists. Futhermore, the American GE in November could provide a specific motive for anyone wishing to worsen Bush's chances of a second term. That could work the other way as well though, and large numbers of Americans could unite behind him in a statement of patriotism and defiance of the terrorists. That would truly be the last thing the world needs.  On an entirely different note, I think the Americans are hugely overdoing the security. The fact is, if Al-Qaeda wants to attack, it will attack and no amount of special forces can stop a truck-bomb. It has simply served to turn the 'Land of the Free' into nothing of the sort. Of course, even under Democracy we can never have a free country. If we do not wish to pay our taxes, we go to jail. If we attack someone, we go to jail. If we disagree with our leaders, there is nothing we can do, and voting is hardly unanimous. The leader may only get in by a 48% majority, or even a 48% minority in the case of George W Bush. But let's not go there. The fact is a totally free nation would not be a good thing at all. In a state of anarchy, the world would simply not progress. But still, random stop-and-searches and overt special forces operations are going too far. America is answering to the call of Al-Qaeda.  I find myself thinking that fighting terrorism at all is futile. For all our armies, we cannot fight an enemy which we cannot see or contain. Perhaps the 'civilised' Western world could act civilised and try to seek peace. Forget all the cliches that it would be what the terrorists wanted - of course it is! I'm sure they would all prefer a world where they weren't attacking America, as long as America wasn't attacking them either. Ok, there are some inhuman monsters out there - on both sides - but a lot of the suicide bombers are simply those who have lost family to America's attacks, and are probably not entirely unreasonable. As it stands, America is quite rightly hated throughout the Muslim world, but if it did something to amend its reputation even the most extreme of extremists would be powerless without the support of the people. As long as the said fanatic is not in government, his power is from his followers and those willing to lay down their lives in honourable suicide for him. Few people would be willing to do such a thing without just cause. But for as long as Camp Delta stands, and America continues her Islam witch hunt, terrorism will exist. It will not go away on its own, nor can we overpower it.  Perhaps this is just a dream that will never be realised. Both sides may well have become far too proud to make concessions. But one thing to me is certain: if no concessions are made then this war will rage for at least the duration of my lifetime.
