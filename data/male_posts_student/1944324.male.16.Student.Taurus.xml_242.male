Gods in heaven, it’s easy to do The things you wanted, we sacrificed them to you Immortal Lady, you know who I am, You know you can’t let me lose to Priam  All our forces, couldn’t get into Troy All our forces, couldn’t get into Troy  You’ve watched us suffer, fighting in vain, Helen is still there, inside their domain No sweeping exits from enemy lines Could make us feel bitter and leave her behind  Men and horses, could get lost in the fray All our forces, still would not go away  I know I’ve dreamed of getting inside And Meneleaus, would get back his bride Walls would be broken, Tears would be cried All of the Trojans, soon will have died  Large, Wheeled horses could get us into Troy Large, Wheeled horses could get us into Troy  Large, Wheeled horse, could get us into Troy Trojan forces, we soon would destroy  To be perfectly honest, Jonah came up with the idea and part of one of the verses.  It's still sort of a work in progress, so any suggestions would be appreciated.  And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.
