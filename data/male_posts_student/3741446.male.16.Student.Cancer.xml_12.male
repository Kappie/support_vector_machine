Even as record sales continue to rise, artistic expression and even involvement decrease with every Britney and N Sync clone forced into collective CD collection. Of course, music is about fun, and everyone has a right to listen to whatever they desire, but as these cookie cutter starlets achieve the bulk of our interest and music dollar an ever growing number of musicians making music from the heart are stymied and left in the shadows. Children force fed MTV's definition of music will never know the joy of listening to a real masterpiece that transcends mere trend to become a anthem for any generation. I plead with you, take an interest in music and pursue it. Listen to Jazz, Blues, Classical, and anything you like, but make sure you decide what YOU listen to. Don't let the record companies looking to make maximum profit from minimal effort decide for you.
