I sent out 50 copies of the PW survey and will only be allowed to send out the next 50 via Email by the hotmail staff in about 15 hrs time. Betcha didn't know that you could only send 50 Emails a day. Oh, you did?... Fine! Have been thoroughly entertained by the replies that have come in so for the homosexuality survey. One can clearly differentiate arts from science respondents. Shall blog entertainingly about it when I have the time.  Just got off the phone with Jolyn. It's 2.31am. I don't want to get too close to her. I'm afraid I'd screw things up again. None the less, she's lovely. Snarf. Meep. ho... Jo makes noises and Sharmini talks trash about being lonely. Ho... Girls and love are like fire, nice to be around coz they keep you warm, but get too close and you get burned. I learnt that. I'm still recovering but dreams add salt to my wounds nightly.  FMSS choir concert is on a Tuesday preceding my econs exam, smack in the centre of exam week. My baby is more important. I put my life into that choir. I've family there. I go for concert.  Leon Oei had a gig at church today. He said that they lost the competition but he had a great time anyway and then said something about going deaf.. I envy him. Looks, personality, physique, acts well, drums well, swims well, pretty girlfriend... guitar, bass, 11 pts, band. If I actually did a list, I'd finish tomorrow. I guess I'll always be in his shadow. Dorcas is nice too. OH MY GOSH! It just hit me that they've been on since before dec sev! Shit! WHAT CAN HE NOT DO! WHY CAN'T I!   I'm an envious person. Optimists call it ambitions. I'm pessimistic. Bite me.
