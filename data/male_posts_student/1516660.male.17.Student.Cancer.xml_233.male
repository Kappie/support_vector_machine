That's for later. Let me narrate what happened in the afternoon first.  Okie...in the afternoon (morning? No need to narrate la...so boring and typical. Oh yes. I completed a page of my web. Wee!), I went out to shop for christmas prezzies. I only had enough moolah to spend for the music students and Wendy. Hmm... I shan't reveal what I brought, cause some of them do read my blog. In total, I brought about $27 worth of prezzies. Oh, WQ came along also. He even lied about the time, making it one hour later. Qi shu lin! I was so darn angry... I thought his legs were tired and just wanna go home early. How irresponsible! Later, he said he saw the time wrongly. Hmm..... How can see the number "2" for "4"? And on 1something, he said it was 3something. I smell something fishy!!!!  Hm..I went home surfed the net, ate some noodles. Then, I set my way towards Causeway Point, meeting my friends at 6pm. It looks like Ke Yun came along also. Coolies! Another non-Christian cat!  We met there and went down to the Interchange to wait for the bus. HaHa! After waiting for so so long, it was announced that the bus was upstairs instead. Thereofre, we trudged up and towards the bus.   In the bus, YH sat with KY, XX sat with moi. XiaoXi introed me to this guy, Zi Wei ar. ZW supposedly knew me from primary school, but I don't recongize him at all leh! I can't place him....probably from 4/1 ba. I must ask Esther who he is. On the bus, I just read my book (Oh! Today, I brought Truths and Consequences, yet another Charmed book).   We finally arrived there. We first had to go up to 3rd floor (Hann pressed the 'down' button and was scolded by an idiot. He didn't know okay!!). Then, we had to queue up and get sorted here and there. HaHa. We finally got seats. Only me, Hann and KY though. The rests have to seat on the aisle. Felt kinda guilty.   I didn't realize how close we are to the speakers until they started singing worship songs. Woah!! So loud sia. Of course we didn't sing la. We just clapped along to the rhythm (must at least respect them...). After songs, they talked a little about their programs and introed HYS.   Her songs were okay la. We three bopped along to her songs HaHa. She sang about 6 songs, sghe told us her story. As a teenager experiencing depression and how she accepted Christ into her life. It was quite touching lor. I conveniently left out the part about asking us to try to accept Christ. HaHa. After that le, it was another priase song. This time hor, i can only see me, KY and Hann waving our lightsticks. The rest were just hlding their hands up in the air and prasing him. The cameraman focused on us. We are really too obvious. HaHa. Somemore, during prayer, we did not close our eyes. That Pastor Kong lied. He said "If you are sinners, backsliders, please raise your hand to accept Christ". We did no such thing, of course. However, when hands were raised, he said "I see hundreds! thousands! lots!". However, we three say very litttle hands raised. Not even amounting to half a hundred. Ha.  After service ended, we milled around and went out to wait for the chartered bus. Me, KY and Hann discussed what we experienced la. KY told us some ghosts stories, some Buddhist stories (we have to keep our voices low...we don't want to offend the whole busload of Christians). We took the chartered bus towards Woodlands Interchange, where I went off first.   Overall, the concert thingy was fun. I enjoyed myself. HeHe. Hann smsed me and thanked me for accompanying him. :)  Okay....Sat now. Hmm...Just now nothing happened lor. Just ate and watched TV. WQ wrote a very touching testimony for my Friendster. O.o!! Go check it out. Tonight, we are drinking sparkling champagne. HaHa. Mother brought 4 bottles. HaHaHa.  I think that's today's blog la. Quite short for today, I know. Almost nothing to say ma. So see ya tomorrow! Bye blog!
