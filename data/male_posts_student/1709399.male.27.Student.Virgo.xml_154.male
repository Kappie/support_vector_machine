It boasts of State of Art Infrastructure (Trains, Stations,Parking ) and gives you a feeling of almost being abroad. Delhi Metro looks very similar to the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) in San Francisco , which I used to commute a few years earlier. The Doors are automatic and the announcements are very well made and if the entire project is completed , it would be a great Boon for the city of Delhi and its suburbs.
