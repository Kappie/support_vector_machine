I decided to quit LiveJournal because it was bothering me, haha.Hopefully this'll be a lot more productive than my LiveJournal experience, lol.    Anyway, I've had this account at blogger for a while, and I just realized I posted a really stupid entry before I got my LiveJournal. I think it's hilarious, but in hindsight, it was a mistake, haha. I'd take it down, but I want to leave it for posterity. Everyone can gather 'round and absorb my pre-LiveJournal ignorance, haha.        It's 12:53 AM, and I've gotta get some sleep...
