This might not really interest you guys but oh well, usually I write my best posts when Im in a sarcastic mood. So I'll start writing and then see if it actually makes sense. Where should I start?...   Iraqi beheadings . I have recently noticed that beheading people is becoming increasingly popular, especially with our Iraqi friends of course, who killed a Korean hostage lately. The reason I felt sorry for (not because normally I wouldn't) the Korean hostage, was that he knew the same thing was going to happen to him, as with the other hostages (Nick Berg etc.). I mean, being a hostage and not knowing about what a terrible death you will have is alright, compared to being a hostage, and wating for the moment when they'll drag you infront of a camera, say a few words like "Get out Americans" and slowly cut through your throat. I simply can't stop thinking about this, I'm not shocked by the video, its just the thought of what he was going through; just imagine being there, in the same orange pyjamas Nick Berg was in, infront of the same people who killed Nick Berg, and in the same situation. Oh well, I guess I'll just leave it by saying "life is unfair".     I just wanna add a morbid comment, that I got from my friend when I was talking about the same thing with him. He described this phenomenon as probably being "peer pressure" (hahaha), and that the method of persuasion probably worked something like this "come on Ahmed, every one is doing it! Just give it a chance and try it!" As an outsider, I really could think of this whole thing as a new 'trend', afterall it is quite affective, isn't it?   Lesson learned:  Iraq is not a tourist destination
