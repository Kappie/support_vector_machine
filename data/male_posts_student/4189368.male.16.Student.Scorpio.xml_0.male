I'm still really tired and maybe that's why I was being a dick to some leecher in a WinMX channel. I've been a member of anime channel x for a very long time, and I've had administrative powers for as long as I can remember. Recently the password to get to my level (175 out of 230) was leaked by accident and had to be changed. Unfortunately, I was out of town at the time so I didn't get the new login. I didn't bother with it untill today when some asshole came in sharing 0 files. The rules say 0 files = the boot so I told him why he was wrong, asked him to leave, and, when he refused, logged in as a member (150 out of 230)  and kicked him out, but I didn't have the authority to ban him so he came right back in. After a few kicks he finally shared some files, so I let him stay, but he had lied to us saying stuff like "I am new to WinMX" and "I have no files to share" so I was an asshole to him. When he left at least, he returned with over 500 files, but the moron hadn't actually left WinMX, he had just changed his name so the last 5 digits of his name (which are static and unique)  were still the same. I let him talk to people for a few minutes before pointing out who he was. He provoked me so I retaliated (just some minor arguments) and eventually, it just died off. He left once again when he had no success looking for a stand up comedian in an anime room (gee... wonder why) and life moved on. When he came back he made some more comments and I eventually kicked him again for calling the room a bunch of fuckers. He came back once more and said "Join AU (a rival channel) acx fucking sucks" I tried to kick him out again, but I was beat to it by Soviet (who runs the channel). A few minutes later, after politely asking Soviet for the missing login and getting no response, Someone with a name consisting entirely of numbers entered and I recognized the last 5 digits as those of the leecher who had been bothering me all day. He only had 3 files shared so, before I kicked him, I wanted to make sure it was him. I said something not exactly nice, but it wasn't really mean and when I was in the process of typing something accusing him of being the same guy I was kicked. No big deal... I get kicked out all the time because I'm prone to acting like a jackass when I get bored, but this was different, I was doing what I was supposed to do.  I tried to get back in (thinking maybe I had just lagged out or something) and I found I couldn't. I refreshed my chat room list and still couldn't get in... I had been banned. I tried to ask soviet why he had banned me through a personal message, but I found that he was ignoring me. I waited out the alloted time of my banning and returned to the channel (with my usual acx tag off MIA) and asked politely why I was banned. When Soviet un-ignored me, he told me it was for being mean to people, but I found out from a friend who was in there that Soviet had kicked a number of people. I have a lot of shit to deal with at home, my mom, my brother, school starting in a few days, my desperate search for a girlfriend and my constant failures in pretty much every area of life. I deal with my therapist who I don't like going to anymore and I deal with my friends who are constantly becoming jackasses one by one... I don't need more shit to deal with online from a WinMX channel that I've done more for over the summer than I've done for my mother... I've recruited people, helped many members, given up my bandwidth and postponed my online gaming because I wanted to let someone in acx finish their downloads from me and when I try to do my assigned duty as an admin, I get banned and ignored... I'll be better off without having to deal with all of that and maybe I'll have a little more time to do something fun... instead of wasting my time in a chennel that shows no appreciation.
