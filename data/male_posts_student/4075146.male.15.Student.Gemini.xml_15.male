Some want space to be shared by all: 'Outer space is a province of all mankind. There is not, and should not be, any privatization of outer space. It is a common thing that should belong to all.' Some people have claimed parts of the moon or Mars. In response, a  lawyer has claimed the sun , 'to show how ridiculous a property-rights system in outer space would be if it were based solely on claims unsubstantiated by any actual possession.' The  Space Settlement Initiative  wants official recognition of land claims made by those who establish human settlements on the moon or Mars."    An interesting topic, one that I've never thought of, actually...if there is to be some sort of space colonization, beginning with the moon, privatization and land ownership  has  to be involved, otherwise you get a huge mess. But you can't go claiming whatever place you want, otherwise I'm grabbing Europa in an instant (Jupiter's moon with liquid water and chances of life underneath it's icy surface). Hell, I'll take the whole galaxy. But it just doesn't work that way. As I see it, this article goes to two extremes, when the right answer is (as usual) somewhere in the middle. How about this for a rule? If you can get there, and you want to claim it, you can. Should there be limits on how much you can claim, so that the first astronauts to walk on Mars (hey, maybe I'll even be among them!) don't decide to snatch up the whole planet for themselves? Probably, but that should be decided at a MUCH later point...For now, you can't just have lawyers laying claims on the sun. If he wants the sun, he can go over there and stake his claim on it himself--you have to put your flag on it, though, first!. Matter of fact, if any lawyer wants to head over to the sun to claim it, I wouldn't mind at all...
