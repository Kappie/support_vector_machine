But anyway, the theme for today is.......you got it.........BORING ! lol...........so anyway, now kids, its your favourite crappy and sucky poem coposing time with me again............  The Computer Monitor   I glare at him, and he glares back at me, My eyes barely opening i struggled to see him Just wondering when from this spell will I break free. He's the computer monitor, he owns your soul,  Wishing that your boredom be multiplied a thousand-fold.  Seeing her face i sob and pine,  of unrequited love divine. He sits in front of me and sniggers,  Oh how i want to show him the finger. With silence over me, I frown, As the pain consumes my being ever faster I wonder when will I come around To experience again, she and I together in laughter.  For fire i do not fear. Only your coldness would cause a grown man to tear For your indifferent gaze inflicts a searing pain, As i wonder am i doing all of this in vain. For this poem i compose, braving his snigger i conclude. I shut him up, i turn him off, I lay down my head, beneath my sobs To Cry over a love forlorn,  I close my eyes, there she is, With Open arms and a wide, warm smile, From a harsh reality i escape.  Into her sweet embrace, that's where i'll stay. For i know soon, this will end, into the painful reality will I be sent. Braving his smirks yet again, I know you will wait for me here all the same........ .  ..............................>>>>>>>>>>>>>
