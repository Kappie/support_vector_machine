Sure this movie would be entertaining to see...if you are a 12 year old girl, unfortunately I'm not, so I didn't like it too much.  The story was typically dumb like it is in all these types of movies, and the acting wasn't anything special either. That being said, this is a great movie for your little sister or to take younger kids (mainly girls) to, so if that's what you want this is a good flick to go see.  Basically, the story is about twin sisters (guess who plays that role!) with opposite personalities. One is super nerdy the other wants to be a rock star. They both go to New York (hence the title), one to get her band heard at the Simple Plan concert by music scouts, the other to give a speech and try to get a scholarship to Oxford University. It's getting to their destinations that proves difficult (go figure!)  Personally, I wouldn't watch this movie, or recommend it unless you have kids, but still I have to give it points for some funny parts with Eugene Levee, and an appealing film for kids.    Rating:  2.5/5      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
