Me: Becca, do you know what a paper shredder is? Becca: Yeah, one of those things that shreds paper. Me: And, Becca, can I fit into a paper shredder? Becca: Well, you have to specify. Me: Oh, yes, let me just fall into the people-shredder placed conveniently next to my desk.  Becca, Becca, Becca. Anyways, life is still rocking. Mike got home today, and we played some more Megaman X. We ended up losing all of the passwords so we had to start over :(. Tis OK, we got back to the last level, but the problem is we're missing a Sub tank.  I finally caught the third episode of The Assistant in other news.  I'm continuing my flogging molly lyrics...   Flogging Molly -   Drunken Lullabies  Must it take a life for hatful eyes To glisten once again Five hundred years like Gelignite Have blown us all to hell What savior rests while on his cross we die Has the Shepard led his lambs astray to the bigot and the gun  Must it take a life for hateful eyes To glisten once again Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess Singin' drunken lullabies  I watch and stare as Rosin`s eyes Turn a darker shade of red And the bullet with this sniper lie In their bloody gutless cell Must we starve on crumbs from long ago Through these bars of men made steel Is it a great or little thing we fought Knelt the conscience blessed to kill  Must it take a life for hateful eyes To glisten once again Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess Singin' drunken lullabies  Ah, but maybe it`s the way you were taught Or maybe it`s the way we fought But a smile never grins without tears to begin For each kiss is a cry we all lost Though there is nothing left to gain But for the banshee that stole the grave Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess Singin' drunken lullabies  I sit in and dwell on faces past Like memories seem to fade No colour left but black and white And soon will all turn grey But may these shadows rise to walk again With lessons truly learnt When the blossom flowers in each our hearts Shall beat a new found flame  Must it take a life for hateful eyes To glisten once again Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess Singin' drunken lullabies
