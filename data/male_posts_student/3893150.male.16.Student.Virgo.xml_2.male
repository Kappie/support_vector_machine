I spent the wonderful day with Claire last wednesday so we know that. but yeh...I had some movies rented, so I watched them. one a day for five days. good-ness. watched Dazed And Confused, Up In Smoke, Half-Baked, Game Of Death and Boondock Saints. and some others on TV and what not. now, prepare for a little spiel here. it's taken me quite some time to see Boondock Saints. came out in 1999. I've heard about the movie for a while, from random friends from forums and reading threads about it on IMDb. I'm kicking myself now fornot seeing it sooner...one of the most stylish movies I've seen since I first seen Kill Bill. so well shot..everything about it I loved. Willem DaFoe owned, as usual. he's one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. so versatile. also seen Spiderman 2 tonight, with claire and some of her friends. I'd say it lived up to the hype and everything. not extremely polar-opposite from other superhero movies, but it was developed well..with the Peter/MJ love struggle thing and what not. good times. the third movie is gonna be cool, although I think every Spidey fan in the world is waiting for the movie with Venom and Carnage and all those cool cats. yeh...maybe that's it for now? claire is leaving tomorrow. thats sad...but she should be back soon. hopefully. tata, internet stalkers.
