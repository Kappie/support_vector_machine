So last night I watched  Gone in 60 Seconds  while waiting for my ride to the GSO Party... man that party was sterile. It was like in an office or something. Free beer though... that's always good. Then I had some of the Koreans over at my place for some vodka.  Today I lounged around most of the day... watched  Roman Holiday ... slept... did a little bit of writing... chatted... that's pretty much it. Nothing super productive...  ***
