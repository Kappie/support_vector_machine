When we got to the beach we found it was much windier and was putting a chill in the air.  But the water was warm (ish) and so we stayed.  We threw an aerobie around for awhile but I was up wind of Geoff so it kept being lifted up and thrown in random directions.  I got my own back on him eventually.  Going to a BBQ tonight so hopefully the rather overcast day we are having will clear up.....
