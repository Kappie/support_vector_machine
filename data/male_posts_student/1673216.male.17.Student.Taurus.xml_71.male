At the door was a fat woman that insisted I come downstairs with her. The hotel was big, so I asked if I could get dressed first. She agreed and waited outside the door while I dressed. My window had been left open, and when I looked out I could just see the markets starting to open for the day. 	Downstairs the woman suggested I sit down with her at a table. The lobby was also very big. I looked around and noted the hotel’s features. She looked up and smiled. “I have a message to deliver to you.” “From who?” I said. “A Mr. Robert Cohn.” “What does he want?” “To meet you at the Rue Soufflot today at noon. He came by last night and didn’t want to disturb you, so I took a message.” 	I took the S bus like always down the streets to get to the restaurant. I knew Cohn would already be there and probably already drunk. From the window of the bus I saw some billboards advertising for some wine. Crossing the street I opened the door to the Rue Soufflot and immediately saw Cohn’s at a table. He looked at me with some sort of Jewish pride look, to show that he had arrived first. It was a fine day and I felt bad going indoors. “Nice to see you, Jake.” Cohn said. “Don’t call me Jake.” “Glad to see me?” “Sure.” I lied. I was still angry after all this time. I barely remember why. I couldn’t remember a lot of things from that time, or any time. We ordered some drinks and started drinking, but not saying much. When the food arrived there was more silence. Not until after all the food was gone and cleared off the table did he say much. “Curious why I am in Paris?” He smirked. “Actually, I am. Why are you here? To bother me?” “Of course not Jake, why would I?” “Why do you do anything? Why do I do anything? It’s always the same reason.” “What’s that?” “Because there is no reason, Cohn. Not for you, or me, or anyone.” 	We were both quiet after I said this, sitting at the table, and sometimes taking drinks from our wine glasses. The waiter came at one point and asked if we would like anything. This broke the silence for a moment, and I said no. Outside the streets were dampening in the weather. I looked back at Cohn and smiled. “I would have thought you would have figured that out by now.” “Jake, you make no sense sometimes. So do you want to go on vacation with me or not?” “What?” “Oh, that’s the reason I came here. Brett and I are going on a business trip to Africa. We are both in the same business, training to be journalists.” “No thanks, I am busy.” I was still smiling. I asked Cohn if he was finished. He left the bar quite confused and angry, unlike me. I didn’t expect to ever see him again, but what did that matter?
