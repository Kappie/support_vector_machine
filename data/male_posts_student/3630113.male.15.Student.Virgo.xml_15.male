For some unknown reason i'm in a really really bad mood. Perhaps it's because of "it"...but i've been trying to get over it...no doubt i've been unable to do so thus far. Injured my tailbone...Specs disformed by some idiot with a fetish of stripping males..wth man..like i did anything to offend him...at least the conscience that remains within my memory capacity is clear...whoever you are you better not let me know who you are..feel worse than crap now...still got 2 tests to handle tmr...hais.
