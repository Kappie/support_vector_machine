This is a great song off the Spiderman 2 Soundtrack. Dashboard has done it again, with its amazing vocals and beautiful instrumentals, this song is the epitome of Dashboard Confessional. I give this song a 9.2 of 10  #4. Memory- Sugarcult. This song is awesome because it applied to me at one time. Hes saying he likes someone but he knows it would never work. Yep it happens to the best of us. 9.4  #3.Last chance to lose your car keys- Brand New. If you haven't heard Brand New by now, you dont know what your missing out on. This is one emo band that knows how to represent. Ever been tricked by a girl? this is the song for you. 9.5  #2. Understanding in a car crash- Thursday. An awesome band, an awesome song. They play with such powerful emotion. I love 'em. enough said. 9.8  And here it is folks:  #1. Sic transit gloria... glory fades- Brand New. They've done it again, this song is flawless in my opinion. The lyrics are powerful, yet the melodic nature of the song is what keeps me coming back for more. 10 of 10. perfection.  Well thats all for this week, check back next time for the Top Fizzle CDs in my posetion.  Post a comment to let me know what you think we should count down in the future.
