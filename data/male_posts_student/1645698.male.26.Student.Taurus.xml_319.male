News about Kerry's former/still-on-going affairs haven't risen yet. Somewhat disturbing... Well I finally managed to figure out why Dean didn't win. His entire campaign was directed towards the younger generation... and as we all know the younger generation do crap. Since not many of his teenage supporters voted... well you know the rest. I was rooting for Dean all the way... now I have to hang my head in shame and root for Sharpton... is he still in the race? I haven't heard news of him in a while... By the way, Nice to see you back Todd.
