Yeah, I know, its been like a week since my last post, but lets put the past behind us eh?  There's so much shit to talk about, I dunno where to start...I guess we can start with last  Friday , because that fuckin' deserves some merit!  OK, so  Friday ...well it all started out with school.  Like slaves we did toil through the tedious hours of school.  And not just on  Friday  either.  The whole week served up a shitload of...well shit.  So pretty much, like all kids, we anticipated the weekend...a brief two-and-a-half days(cuz  Friday  we have school for a little bit, but after school we are free to do what we please with the remainin' hours of the day) escape from the burdens of reality.  Anyway, basically school was suckin', shit was happenin', and we were all draggin' ourselves through the week.  So when  Friday  came, it was met with open arms, and legs if yer a whore like I am...haha.  Anyway, a last-minute plan was drafted by  Eddie  and  me  to go to  Castle Park  and tackle the arsenal of  arcade games  that the Castle has to offer.  So after  my mom  dropped us off in the creepily deserted parking lot (I think the Castle is goin' through repairs or somethin') and we marched our way through the cheesy "drawbridge" style doors...  ...and we found that the arcade as almost as empty as the parking lot!  I swear!  It even rivals the emptiness of  Nick's  crotch!  Anyway, with the Park's play things at our perusal, we wasted no time runnin' over to the token machine.  I watched as the machine ate up a week's worth of  lunch money , but starvin' myself was worth it...oh my precious tokens!  Anyway, we started off with a little game of  Air Hockey .  I scored some points...too bad they went to  Eddie  since I happened to knock the fuckin' puck into my own goal so many damn times!  So yeah, I got prison-raped at that game...anyway, we moved on over down to the  old school  section of the arcade where we played  The Simpsons  and kicked major ass at it!  Seriously, we beat the game!  The game wasn't the only thing I wanted to beat...these annoyin' ass  Ninos del Inferno  ( "Children from Hell"  [they were  Mexican , hence the  Spanish ]) kept tryin' to talk to us and I was ready to put  my joystick  (yeah, that one) in one of their mouths and gag them to death.  Anyway, the we played  skeeball  and shot some hoops (yeah we did!)...then we moved onto  The House of the Dead , where  Eddie  and  me  we're two brave agents fightin' an army of undead monsters and such.  We were livin' out our life long childhood dreams!  That game pretty much ate up all of our tokens, and after havin' the words "Reload!" shouted at me, I was ready to go.  We beat that game too by the way (Freaks!).  Anyway, with my last token, I played  Galaga , which has always been a favorite of mine.  After that, we took our game tickets to the conunter and I got  a whistle  and  Eddie  got some  fake lips  (contrary to the ones he has between his legs).  With no where to go, we did what every other high school kid does when they don't have shit to do...we headed off to the mall!  It was pretty funny, cuz we knew  Liz  and  Elyse  would be there, so it was an earnest ambition to ambush them at the mall.  It was pretty sad though, cuz our own stupidity foiled our devious plot.  Even though we knew our plan was ruined, we still tried to fool them anyway.  On the way to the mall, bored and extremely dangerous, we searched the streets, lookin' for fun.  Our eyes (all three of them) fell upon an unlikely diversion... a shopping cart !  Like a bad little punk rock kid, I wanted to push  Eddie  in it, but I don't think he wanted to get in...so then I thought we could at least ride it.  So I hoped on the back,  Eddie  took the front, and we charged down the sidewalk in our makeshift  G-ride .  Yellin' and swearin', we made our way down the street constantly stoppin' to avoid veerin' off into the grass and some palm trees.  It was really fun, and I've got the scars to prove it!  After our episode with the cart, we headed to the mall.  We walked around and we went into the  No Fear Store  and I showed  Eddie  where I got my shirt, which is so fuckin' koolaid!  Anyway, it happened to be near the  Sharper Image  store, where  Liz  and  Elyse  were.  We tried to hide from them, but they spotted us, and we ran up the escalator to escape the clutches of evil!  There was no use tryin' to ditch them, as they were trailin' us like a bunch of angry prostitutes who we hadn't paid for the bad blowjobs they gave us!  We shot into the  Gamekeeper  and sought sanctuary there.  Only the fat ass cashier, armed with his bucket gun that shot gusts of air at you (a la "queaf" style) ratted us out and they found us.  So then we went to the  Sharped Image  store, our party now four.  I had an OK time havin' the metal penises encased within comfy leather armchairs fuck my back for me.  It was really quite nice, and they also had gargantuan dildos appropriate named  "back massagers" .  Just face it, they're just big dildos.  No use tryin' to hide that fact from the little ones.  And come on...one of 'em was called  "The Thumper."   'Nuff said!   Eddie  tried to put one in my mouth and made me bite my lip...ouch!  Anyway, we left cuz the propreitors were givin' us dirty looks.  I was pretty hungry and we went to  Pacific Grill .  I offered to buy the girls so  Freedom Fries  from  McD's , but they refused.  Oh well, its yer ass that'll be hungry and not mine.  After that, we went  Spencer's  and had fun listenin' to keychains have orgasms, testin' out lube (that smelt horrily like latex), whips and French ticklers, tryin' on masks, and lookin' at fat chick porno b-day cards!  It was really koolaid and kick ass, and I had so much fuckin' fun!  After that,  Eddie  and  I  had a cravin' for  Pop Rocks  and went to the  Sweet Factory  in search of them.  I was lost in Pop Rock-goodness...*drooling*  Anyway, I had to use the bathroom after that, and so we went, and thats when  Liz  and  Elyse  parted ways with us...or so we thought.  Seein' how as after they left, we had nothin' else to do, we headed out to where they were waitin' for their ride and waited with them.  There was a little squabble over where each of us should sit...blah blah.  Anyway, after they left,  Eddie  and  I  checked out  EB Games , then walked our asses over to  Sportsmart , strictly for the nostalgic value and because they have a water fountain and Pop Rocks make you thirsty.  Then we headed to  Petco  and after 15 or 20 mins. of "oozin' ahhs" we waited outside for our ride and played with my cell phone.    All in all, great night out with my fuckin' best buds in the world!  We gotta do it again sometime.  It was so kick ass and so fuckin'....."koolaid!"  The mere memory of that day makes me long for the weekend once more!  More to come...!
