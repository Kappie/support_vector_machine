The Sox did win by the slimest of margines and so far, this past month and a half of baseball between Cubs and Red Soxs (not together mind you...aww screw explaining it) has proven that my heart does in fact beat, and I respond to stimuli.  Damn the Yankees.   I wish I knew how to do this, but you all will just have to be resourceful...Go find sound clips of Stewie from the Family Guy.  They are out there, and are priceless.   Or rent the DVD's.  Best stuff ever I tell you.  Also, I wish that when you read my lines, you hear Stewie's voice, because, well I rather like his tone.  BLAST!!!!!
