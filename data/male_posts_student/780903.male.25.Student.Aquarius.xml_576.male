"Blackin' Out" (to the tune of Billy Joel's "Movin' Out")  Anthony works in the grocery store Throwing his meat in the garbage But Mama Leone's serving sushi next door And there's a line twenty-deep for her bathroom They say a man in Cleveland coughed and we go black-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack Or that is the theory now  First we just blame the Canadians You know all they do is cause trouble And it seems such a waste of food That leftover crap I saved Ice cream's heating up cause we're blackin’ out.  We're blackin' out, oh oh...  Sergeant O’Leary is walkin’ the beat Arresting the looters at Denny's They're stealing ninety-nine cent burgers As the bank goes untouched They're putting twenties aside to chase pennies They say it's not another terrorist attack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack That's scheduled late this fall  And the subways stopped and the gas won't pump At least we can still drink the water And at Ohio's Cedar Point They're stuck in a coaster loop Hanging a hundred feet up 'cause we're blackin’ out.  We're blackin' out, oh oh...  No one's ever gonna visit Cleveland-land-land-land-land-land Like they ever did before But at least in a day we got power back Before we were killed in a riot And it seems such a waste of meat It seems such a waste of cheese Landfills will be filling up cause we're blackin’ out.  We're blackin' out, oh oh...
