I found a few properties of chocolate.  It stimulates hormones that would usually be triggered by rubbishy hormones like Love  romance, and the twisted female intereptation of sex.  It also has magnsium and some other ions that ladies love, and require a shitload of (thanks to our friend Menstruation)  It also contains more drugs than bennett's bloodstream, most noteably; Anandamide. A toned down version of Weed. The protein in question binds to the same THC-Receptors. In other words. Chocolate is a very week version of pot.  its also got N-oleoylethanolamine and N-linoleoylethanolamine (triggers production of more Anandamine) caffeine, theobromine (related to caffeine) tyramine (An anti-depressant)  phenylethylamine (I think thats a rip-off of adrenline)  Not that i have anything against Chocolate. But i do have something against dependancy on anything other than yourself. Just cause it's legal doens't mean its right. and visa versa
