Speakin of my bz schedule..reminded me of my awallah dondang performance in singapore polytechnic convention centre.. Everything went well..A good crowd turnout..brilliant performance by all.. anw lucky dat my voice can be clearly heard during the performance..coz during previous rehearsals..havin prob wif voice projection dat i end up shouting here n there.. but tinkin back again i shud not have encountered that prob..coz have been used to acting.. even the AD performance is now my third in big event performances since i entered poly.. seems like i'm permanent figure in the malay cultural inter tertiary events here..1st was pentas pujangga in NUS ...den nostalgia 04 in NP n now AD.. AD's over n now time to turn up my focus on IAW startin this wed..hehe juz now was the last meetin i chaired with the comm.. very glad n nice to work wif them for abt one mth..happy wif the progress made esp the comm was very new n the time given is too short.. hope that IAW will be successful one..
