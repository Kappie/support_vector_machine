I've had a lot of shit running through my head and there just aren't nearly enough hours in a day to get everything I want to do put into play. I think the problem is that I have too many passions (ie. Making music, listening to music, photography, cooking, writing, reading, and "debunkifying" to name a few) and if that's not enough, they conflict with my responsibilities to no end.  I'm looking to write a few things to put up here: -My positive shift in attitude towards The Beatles (I really love that band now... used to hate them more than I hate Harry Potter) -an essay on my desire to produce and to pursue the arts while maintaining a stronghold on the sciences. - A possible blurb about my recent trip to Annapolis, MD (the homosexual capital of the world... "what the fuck is this, San Fransisco?!") - the story you've all been waiting for (whether you know it or not): The Cove Story, aka The Tale of Darlington Woods, aka "How I learned to start worrying and hate my friends" - My "Revenge of the Undercooked Lobster" story. - And finally, a detailed analysis on the character of Michael Moore. How he is a piece of shit. How he is snowing the American people into thinking he's a knowledgeable true-patriot. His real agenda and how I can prove he is a homosexual pedophile In the mean time,I suggest you read this essay/whathaveyou [EDIT: link removed because none of you can be trusted with the URL to Cates site] . I found it on the blog of my ex-girlfriend's sister, Cate. She's an excellent writer, and it seems her sentiments on the subject of writing and literature and her approach of it all mirror mine quite accurately. She's quite the interesting chick. Too bad I never got to know her that well. [edited due to insensitivity]
