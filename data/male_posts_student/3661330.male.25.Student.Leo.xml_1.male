The truth is, if I despised her, I wouldn't waste my time writing some stupid ass commentary about her on a webpage that will never get read. This is for her and her alone and yes she is the girl that inspired me to create this page.   But unlike her, I don't want to just kiss her- it could never only go that far with me. But what about her mixed signals, her psuedo lover, etc? Is all of that just a show or do feelings and attractions overpower her will to practice fidelity?   True, she did kiss me once, after knowing me for a total of 3 hours- and she was extremely drunk and tried to play it off the next day at work- but she seems to believe there is a mystery about me, when in truth, the only mystery about me is that I'm the one guy she has wanted to "discover" that she hasn't discovered. She isn't used to not having what she wants- especially with guys. So the attraction she bears is simply uncharted territory- unknown waters if you will. If I was to submit, practice my old ways of infidelity, and give in to my office space desires, once she had me, there would be no more mystery. She wouldn't ponder the inner workings of me. She wouldn't care. She would have taken what she wanted from me, found that I wasn't that big a deal to begin with, and laughed at herself for wasting so much energy concerning herself with me.   But its true, I would like to discover her.
