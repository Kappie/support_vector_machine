Its funny, but two times in my life, life changing events started with a letter.  First when I recieved my orders to the Middle East, and second, Georgetown's acceptance.   Things are going well.  I feel more and more confident about my decisions.  The only thing that sucks is I am twenty three, in college and NOT a doctor.  The thing is, I wouldn't give up my military experience to be any younger, I needed it and better to be young in combat than married with kids or something worse.   Andy has drill this weekend, and I am trying to get out of my own next weekend.  I am going to start packing soon, the time is close.
