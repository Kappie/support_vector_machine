Come on, if you are going to defile something and scold it and curse it and what not, you may as well just stay off that thing. Why do you, despite what you say, instead go and do the exact same thing? Unless you are prepared to take back what you said, which is what I do, if not, just stay away from me! Haha.. just kidding, don't stay away from me, just don't be so quick to condemn everything. I have taken back my words many times, although it is not such a pleasant feeling, but at least it's better to admit you are wrong.  I know that humans are not perfect, but please don't criticise others for something that you do yourself.
