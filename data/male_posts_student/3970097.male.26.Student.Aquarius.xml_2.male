My job was of two hours daily in the morning, and i had to clean up the entire floor of ministers and cabinets included, which was a big task seemd at first but then i got used to it. It was my 3rd day in the House, when i was in one of the offices, dusting off the tables, i felt a cold touch on my shoulders. It ran through whole my body. I was wondering what that could be, bcoz the windows and doors were closed and there was no room for cold breeze to step in. I looked back but found nothing. To mention here, that there was one cleaner on each floor and so was I on the first floor, doing my job. WellI shook my head off and got back to work, finished the day as usuall, drove back home, had breakfast and left to university as usuall. The next day, i went to House, took my gear and headed off to clean the bunch, when i was the same room as the previous day, bz dusting off the tables and chairs, singing to myself...i felt the same cold touch of a hand on my shoulder, i left it all, and started looking what was that, but there was nothing, i checked behind the curtains, under the table, looked everywhere...but what could be there? it was just me, standing there with my cleaning gear,amazed what might have touched me? i was kinda surprised as well as shocked bcoz the touch was of a human hand and i felt that on my shoulder, now that was the second day in turn, i tried but couldnt get it off my mind, so i decided to get back to work, singing in high tunes then before, thought that might help. After finishing off, i came down and signed the leave register, i told my Incharge lady about what has happened and what i felt, but she smiled and advised me not to watch too many movies. So i drove back to my place as used to and followed my daily schedule. Next day, i started workin in my routine again, bearing in my mind that if something happens today then im gonna find it out for sure whats that about? Keeping myself calm, i entered the room and started cleaning, five minutes went very well, nothing happened and i was thinking to myself that it must be my imagination or something else which kept me bothered for the past 2 days. But wait a minute, the next moment i heard a voice, asking me to quiet down as i was singing really loud...geez!! that really broke the shackles if you know what i mean, i opened the door and look right and left in the long coridor, but there was no one, and why should be? it was I who suppose to work on that floor...so i came back in the room, and looked all over carefully, sat on a chair. nod my head, try to forget it but it was just so real bcoz i heard the voice myself. I was really worried, so i started talking to myself that its not real. As i get up saying, "i cant see you but i know you're there". she talked to me again, saying that i have disturbed her by singing that loud. It really made me crazy and I sat back in the chair, whirling my eyes on the roof and around. I couldnt see her but she introduced herself as Ms.Cowan, an Ex-minister of the House. I ran back down staries, telling all this to my incharge, she made me calm down. Then she told me that this is the spirit of Ms.Cowan, who was a minister of the parliament house, and she still lives there but she doesnt disturb anyone unless the person disturbs her. She told me that the cleaners who worked there before me, left the job after finding this out. Thats why she didnt tell me about this in the first place. So I decided to make friends with Ms.Cowan. After that whenever i step in that room, i say, Good Morning Ms.cowan, im afraid i have to clean this up but I promise I wont disturb you." That was just one the incident happened with me in Australia. There are lots more and I will be sharing those with you in days to come.
