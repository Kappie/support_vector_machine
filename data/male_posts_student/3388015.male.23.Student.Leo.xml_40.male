I hadn't intended to actually sign a lease, but he said if I didn't, he was planning to raise the rent $20 and also start showing the apartment to interested parties.  Well, I don't really want people in my apartment when I'm not there, and I really don't want strangers there when I am home!  But anyway, so I signed it for 12 months.  At least this way, it'll be over in May next year, in case I get a chance in job or something.  We'll see.  I went back to UR to try to comfort Cindy, but instead we went and ate at a Japanese hibachi restaurant.  Woah, it was a lot of food.  I ordered the tofu dinner and Cindy ordered the steak dinner.  I chuckled when the cook asked how I wanted my steak done.  Apparently, I'm not the de facto tofu eater.  We left there and headed to Walmart to drop off finished rolls of film for Cindy.  I checked the movie times and we chose to go see Kill Bill 1.  I haven't seen it yet.  So we walked around the store looking at stuff for a little bit to waste some time when we realized the movie started 45 minutes ago.  So we chose Troy, the new movie with Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom.  We bought some candy (heath bites) and headed to Regal in Henrietta.  Cindy was cold so I gave her my only sweatshirt in the car, an ugly red Nebraska thing.  I wore a leather coat my Aunt gave me and stuffed the candy and soda into the coat.  We looked like hicks walking into the theater.    We got into the theater and to our surprise, Raqella was there with her friend.  It brightened Cindy up and we sat with them.  Cindy proclaimed I was funny to sit with in the movie theater and to our delight, we found out all four of us like to talk during the movies.  It seems we no longer watch slides before a movie, but full fledge commercials.  So after 25 minutes of commercials and another 10 minutes of movie previews, the movie started.  It was pretty good.  I like most movies, so when I say its good, people like Jake may hate it.  Whatever.  There were lots of battles, lots of blood, lots of fighting.  It was great and Brad Pitt did a good job in his role as Achillies.  So after 3 HOURS of watching nonstop action, I dropped Cindy off and went home to bed.    Quote:  Cindy: Do you have side impact air bags? Me: No, I only have underneath and in-back air bags. So if we get hit by a rocket from behind, we'll  be okay.
