I'm just waiting for my friends to get home so we can start the weekend. I was playing Star Wars Galaxies all morning and thus has been the highlight of my day so far. Hopefully tonight, my friends and I will go to Cafe Royale's Billards to play some pool tonight. If we do, I'll show you some pictures. Maybe we might try and sneak into the strip club if all goes well. Wish us luck!  Weird news of the day:  urlLink Naked Students Ride Roller Coaster...break world record!
