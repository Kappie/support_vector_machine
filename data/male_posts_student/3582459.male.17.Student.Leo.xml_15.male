The idea was that you could turn it on and open up all the windows, and it would draw air out of the house into the attic and presumeably out of the attic windows, sucking outside air into the house to fill the lower pressure in the house caused by the fan. That way, it would be easy to cool the house down after sunset because air would be changed really fast.   I'm happy to report that this fan thing works really well, especially if we put it on "high" mode (why we would use "low" mode is beyond me). I estimate that in 15 minutes we can attain a 95% air change rate--and keep in mind that the fan air suckage is probably of asymptotic nature (original air starts out at 100% and then decreases exponentially toward 0% but never reaches it).  The house I'm living in right now is about 2800 square feet and is roughly square-shaped, so we only need one of these huge fan things. My first old house, on Baleri Ranch Rd., was like 4800 square feet and shaped like a W, so we would probably have needed to have two fans to have the same effect. My other old house, on Forest Rd., was about 1350 square feet, but was two storied and lacked an attic so such a fan would have been impossible. The small size made such a fan unnecessary, however; we just got some window fans, which worked quite well. In any case, I don't think my dad had the idea until last summer (when we first moved into this house), so we wouldn't have tried to install one of these in either house.
