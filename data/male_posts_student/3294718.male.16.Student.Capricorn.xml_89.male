Furthermore, there's no way they  could  remove the clause from the pledge. It's no technicality - the man who wanted it removed "for his daughter" is not in legal control of her at all. They are in the middle of a custody battle between the man and his wife, who wants her daughter to say the pledge, "under God" inclusive. Not only would the removal of all notion of religion being removed from America as we know it cause legal reindoctrination of all who say the pledge, but furthermore reprinting of billions of dollars, not to mention a horrid revamping of all and everything associated with timekeeping, especially since many days and months were named after gods and whatnot, and we surely can't have that. Rename the planets, chuck out the Declaration of Independence while we're at it, or at least slice it up and take out "all men are created equal, that they are  endowed by their Creator  with certain unalienable Rights" and "with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence."   Beyond this, nobody's forcing you to say the pledge, so settle down, cheech. I'm not sure I ever saw Lade say it, and Wang told us he didn't. Not to mention how Nick Nathan deliberately left out the clause himself, which is his own matter of opinion not to mention just being retarded, and also threw off our canter, especially El Jefe till he learned to ignore him. May I remind you this is also the guy who ran around the room hectically throwing out pencils. That was hilarious.  Furthermore, this God is the same that is admittedly followed by no less than 78.3% of the country as of 2001, quite possibly more after 9/11.  urlLink http://www.gc.cuny.edu/studies/key_findings.htm   In short, 3/4 of the nation may easily become outraged if the clause was removed. Not to mention the illegality of the sue in the first place; there was no way the justices could do anything about it.  Also, when considering very wealthy politicians who claim to know whats good for the common person...  Let's look at who we're supporting in 2004? Eh?
