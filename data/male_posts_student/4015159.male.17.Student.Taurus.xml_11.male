Well today I'm not drinking a single drop of any fluid apart from water, should be quite an easy task because who needs milk, coke, milkshake........... I DO! My taste buds will be deprived of all fluid that is tasty today but I MUST complete this first task! All you people probably think it's going to be easy but you all probably like water, well water BORES me like crazy! So today I'm going to be ripping my hair out, or I could always give in and drink a Yazoo Banana flavoured milkshake, which is my favourite drink EVER! And they're probably really cold by now... hmmmm. Check back later to see how I'm doing!          James
