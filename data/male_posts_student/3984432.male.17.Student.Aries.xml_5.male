The painting process is a bit slow because we always have to wait for the paint to dry, the walls are wierd (concrete), and because the ceilings are so high.  Today will be the last day of painting (starting @ 11:00) and then all I'll have to do is put in the countertop (next Tuesday) and have everything tidied up and organized (hopefully Wednesday).  Thanks to everyone who has helped me out so far and if you, the reader, would like to help feel free to get in touch with me and we can plan something out.  I've gotta go do some chores and get ready for the project. I'll write again soon.
