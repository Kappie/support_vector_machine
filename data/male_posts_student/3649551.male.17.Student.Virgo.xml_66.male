Whatever the case, I thought that being really tired and loopy is a great time to write .... about nothing of any consequence. I wonder how many posts like this I have. Many. Crap, now I feel obligated to write. But I'm all writed out today. I wrote some prose, as usual, and I even wrote a song. Once again, Josh the Philosopher and I teamed up to create a new summer hit. I write the lyrics, he writes the music and plays the guitar. Of course, this second song is meant to be performed by a band, whereas the first is a solo acoustic piece. The first song is a cautionary tale about a raccoon and it's a ballad. We wrote it on Lake Shasta and performed it for the camp. It's titled  The Myth of the Greener Grass . It's about a raccoon trying to cross the road to a new land, but he gets squished. The second song is a Weezer/Green Day/other stuff inspired piece. I call it  My Cynical Love Song . It's a great song for anyone who has ever gotten sick of the countless love songs out there. And it's a very catchy tune. Lots of fun to write - plenty of bitterness to draw on. Well, that's all I feel like writing for now. If anyone has any good ideas for a song, post a comment and maybe I'll write it tomorrow.
