Dance Revolution      Large amounts of junk food .. i.e. cake, chips, pop, ice cream     LAN party?     Poker!     frisbee      Fire!       Pizza!         bowling           movies           conversation           riding down judd hill on a scooter barefoot           music           guitars!                                                 but I don't think I will. Sorry.
