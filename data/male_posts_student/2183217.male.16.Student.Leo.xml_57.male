Except it was the loudest and most out of key singing possible. When we asked my grandpa to join us, he said no and claimed we were making him sick. That just made matters worse for him , and we did it even more. The next day we went to my cousins to celebrate christmas again. The main event of the night consisted of me and my bratty cousins heffing my Schitzophrenic uncle with a spatula taped onto a hockey stick.  Well it started off with my cousin Nick continuously yelling at my uncle that the ottawa senators suck , and when he tried to protest he just interupted a hundred times like OH THEY SUCK! NO ... THEY SUCK!! until the point my uncle started screaming enraged jibberish at us , then we laughed in his face. Nick also did a dance around the room and in front of the tv sining a song about how the senators suck. This made him so angry that he went upstairs to watch the game.     Little did he know, theres some gay ass closet/attick thingy connected to that room. So while sydney stood in front of the tv and distracted him , me and nick slid a hockey stick with a spatula taped to the end through a crack in the wall and slapped him in the face a few times. When he yelled WHAT THE FUCK ! and punched the wall (because he couldn't see us or get to us in any way) i fell into a laundry basket and Nick pissed his pants for real.     Then while nick jumped around singing songs about my uncle with his new guitar, in front of the tv for the last 2 minutes of the game. Me and Sydney went in thru the ratty closet and started poking him with a different hockey stick . He dented the wall and screamed..ARE YOU HAVING FUN?! ARE YOU FUCKING HAVING FUN IN THERE YOU ASSHOLE KIDS!! i swear i never laughed that hard in my life.  I spent another good part of my holiday  watching jerry springer episodes at like 2 am . It's changed a lot since i was in gr 6. One of them had Hillbillies in love, where the audience chants , WE LOVE HILLBILLIES and do hic dances on stage to mock them . Or sometimes they randomly yell YOU SUCK! YOU SUCK ! and ppl asking questions often take off theyre clothes for some discusting reason. The fattest of heffers run around in thongs , and the ugliest people try to insult the hillbillies, even though theyre the ones with about 23 inches of hair under their armpits. The whole show is nasty, but oddly entertaining. Oh yeah , another new addition to the show, a stripper on a pole in the backround takes off her shirt and encourages the audience to make fun of the guests. Then the audience diss her and she flashes them as a response. Uh ... Yeah.  Hillbillies ; 1   My Uncle; 0
