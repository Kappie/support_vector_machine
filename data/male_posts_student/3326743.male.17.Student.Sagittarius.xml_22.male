Tonight I plan to finish Revelation.  I have never felt more inadequate and yet more able for the task (of living for Christ and going to China eventually) that I have before me.  My weakness is great.  My God is above sufficient.  My desire is God.  I wish, pray, and hope that you all have experienced the same.  I have never felt more happy that God is completely sovereign.  I would have it no other way.  Whatever seems best for Him to do with me is fine with me.  He is God.  See you all at school or at my party.  Bye!
