Loren and I were on Main Street, about to go to my house, and this lady came up and was trying to get everybody to leave, and Loren was like, "Don't they always say to stay in school?"  And I, as the lady, am like, "School is no place for teenagers!"  Anyways, here's the survey with my answers:  [x] full name --- Alexander Samuel Dietz I, Sr., Esq.

You're from New Hampshire.  To answer this question, American, no matter what the NNHS Writing Handbook says you're supposed to call it.  `- S`ALL iN THE PAST [x] fondest memory of this year --- Hanging out one night in France, but maybe that's just because my memory isn't wonderful.
