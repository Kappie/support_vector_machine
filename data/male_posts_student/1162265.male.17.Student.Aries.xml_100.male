Fortunately I got an orientation meeting for camp tommorow (or was it Thursday?), and I can finally get towards working with ninos!   My Uncle left today.  So yesterday we went to Ruby Tuesday's.  He's been obsessed with that place, since they don't have them in California.  He's been eating these spicy ribs there like non-stop.  Crazy stuff. So were eating, talking about games and movies and all that good stuff.  He says after he picks up this demo tape from this guy he wanted to come over and play the Matrix game.  Okay, that's cool with me.  I was tired as sin, but it was still cool.   So he comes over and is like "Do y'all have any peptobismol, my stomach is really feeling bad... Probubly from eating those spicy ribs for five days" Okay, laugh.  It was pretty funny.  He threw up like ten times though, and it sounds pretty distressing to hear a grown man throwing up. Anyway, he stayed over until midnight-ish.  Before he left he was like I got a studio recording at like 10AM tommorow, wanna come? So ofcourse I said Okay, what time do I need to be up.  He goes "Nine" and I was like whoa... Damn... sorry no. I'm not gonna be awake that early.  Today I woke up at 11.  Proof I know myself. I tried to play the computer but I was so bored most of the day.  Considering it's 7PM now, I guess I survived, and I'm going to have a job to worry about next week.  So it's all good.
