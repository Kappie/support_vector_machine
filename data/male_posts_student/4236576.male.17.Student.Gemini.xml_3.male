(Well when my parents are around anyways ;) . ) Well my parents were supposed to be picking up my sister this morning so I told her I could stop up around 10:30 /11ish. Around 10 I call her house and her grandma tells me that she is still sleepin and to call back about 12:30/1ish. Well, by about 10:15ish I find out that my parents arent leaving and I also have to go into work for about an hour at 11:30. So, I dont call her until about 12 when I get out of work and she screams at me because I ruined her plans and her day because I didnt come up like I said I could... Like all fights, its my fault, even though she couldnt get up to see me? When there was a possibility that I would come up... Today she went with a friend to a baseball game, which I believe she saw her special "friend there". She has been on the phone all day everytime I call, she then says she has to go, I know shes talking to him.. I dont know what to do. I try to make her happy but I cant get into her, I cant get the chance. The only Idea in her head is that Im a cheater and I cant treat her better. Everytime I try, she pushes me away, saying that I treat her bad. I asked her to decide today, Me or him, she thought about it, then said IDK. Thats pretty much saying "Fuck off", I dont like you anymore. I do everything for her. Yes I did my wrong but am I not allowed to treat her good? That is me. But its very hard to be me when all I get is my mistakes rubbed in my face and treated like dirt. I guess I'm ready to face the world, full of riddicule and prejudice. Instead of being a bystander, I'm a victim of profiling, for having a short period in my life where I made a few mistakes. People never knowing the true me, my future ruined...Will I move on, or have I fallen in love with this girl for good? Idk what to do.
