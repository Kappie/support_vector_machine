The main reason she doesn't think it's a good place is because my older cousin, who is 31, always tells her what it was like 15 years ago. "This one time, there was this huge circle of skin heads dancing in a circle and they tore off their shirts and threw them in a big pile and lit it on fire. Everyone else was smoking pot pretty much." God, Josh, don't tell her that.  About Pammy, Chrissy (Chris, you and Hanna would get along wonderfully, I think) can settle down and go for Kali/Hanna. The reason I didn't say anything about it is because I didn't know what was going on and don't know what is going on.  Man, my face does hurt. It feels like hell. Not only did they cut open my gums, but they had to cut into the bone to dig the teeth out... Ouch... Thank god for the painkillers.
