I use this expression in chat, sort of like a line to keep the conversation going.. And, I also use this expression in my blogs, some of my friends also use this expression in their blogs.. One is Elaine who used the expression: "Hehehe" three times in her latest entry.. Hehehe..   Hehehe...  That's all.. BTW, I used the expression: "hehehe" six times in this entry...  Velasco, OUT!!
