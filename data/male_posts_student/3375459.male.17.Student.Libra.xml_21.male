I wish I could just cough everything out. Things weren’t going too well for Lao Er as she had been having Diarrhea since yesterday night. She’s still not getting any better after taking the ‘ Charcoal ’ tablets, she got from her visit to a polyclinic today. Hhmmmm… Charcoal (carbon), I wonder what does it do?   Today was also the second last Saturday before school reopens. I’m feeling every more restless, I want to get out. Why do I have to be sick?   When on another printer hunt on the net since I really can’t do anything else. There was this Lexmark printer which caught my eyes with its lost cost, however the reviews on Cnet wasn’t too good (avenge rating of 6.5). It says there that it runs out of ink fast with ‘so-so’ quality.  Getting bored just looking at printers, I looked up something else on the net. ‘ Stikfas !’ that’s right stikfas figurines. The guys who made them are guys so damn creative.  Visit  urlLink http://www.Stikfas.com/  for more information. ?Cool?Cute? Can’t decide which word to use to describe these “fanta StiK ” figurines.   Getting drowsy so from my last cocktail of medicine, YES! No more yucky tasting cough syrup! Nitex nitex~
