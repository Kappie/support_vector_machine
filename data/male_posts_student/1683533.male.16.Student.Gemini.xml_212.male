I am very grateful for this place which we get to goto because of Mrs. Randall, the lady who had kids my dad grew up with, and she also considers him one of her sons.  So she is like an extra grandma to me.  She is very funny, we were talking about my grandma and the senoir community complex she lives in,and its library and she asks "Are there any good sex books?" lol, she is just very fun, open, and outgoing you would never guess she is 75.  She is up and about and very healthy.  Anyways, she has a cottage where we visit her and that is where she lives in the summer (she lives in San francisco in the winter)  and it is a beautiful place.  You walk about 50 yards down a path through a meadow in the back, and down some stairs and you are on her private beach on Lake Michigan.  Each sunset, lemme tell you, you have never seen a sunset until you have seen one from her deck.  Pink and red and orange across the clouds, the sun peeking over Lake Michigan until it finally goes under the horizon, it is quite a site.  Mrs. Randall is quite generous too, just like a grandma, if I take a liking to something she tells me to keep it, she is constantly giving me random things and when I weeded her yard today for about an hour she gave me 50 dollars.  Yup just like a grandma.  The water was a tad cold, but you just have to dive in and get used to it.  And nothing beats a midnight swim.  Go out pitch black, the water is very warm from being heated up all day by the sun, the air is cooler than the water usually, so there is a strange mist.  Go out and wade out there, kinda creepy if you are by yourself.  Look up at the stars, its great.  Maybe someday, when I am older, she will be nice enough to let me use the cottage, and I can invite some of you up there.    On a side note, the whole Kate thing may not be over yet, I'm working on it.  I still want to do everything I said tho, so, im working on that too, Im doing alot of working I guess.  And I dont want to be like Peter Griffen and his soup that got away. (eh, a thing from family guy, some may have seen it some may not)
