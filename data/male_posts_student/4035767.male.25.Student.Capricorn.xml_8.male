Every time there is a natural disaster, some nimrod do-gooder comes on TV and complains about "price-gouging."  It is the single most irritating thing about any disaster, and often, depending on the pundit, it's even worse than the disaster itself.    Because diasasters tend to destroy things, they often leave people without some of the things people take for granted every day, such as water, ice, lumber, gasoline, etc.    Since these things have either been destroyed, or because access to them is made much more difficult, the supply has effectively been dramatically reduced.  But, because people are left without them, but still desiring them, demand has dramatically increased.  So what happens when the supply of something goes down, and the demand for it goes way up?  If you said the price goes up, go to the head of the class.    None of us objects when we see this phenomenon in everyday life.  If this year's orange crop yields fere oranges than usual, we expect the price to go up.  We either pay the higher price, or we drink apple juice.  When mad cow disease hits, and thousands of cows are slaughtered, those who feel they can't go without fast food expect to pay more for their Big Mac.    But something happens when a natural disaster hits.  We no longer accept the economic realities of a situation, and we demand that the government institute price controls on necessities.  Some find it outrageous that people could possibly be making a profit at such a time.  So they harass, threaten, and even arrest those who sell bottles of water at dramatically increased prices.    I'm sure they feel good about themselves.  But are those people really helping?  Let's take ice as an example.     The status quo is that there is a shortage of ice.  In other words, more people are demanding ice than there is a supply of ice.  Imagine that the pre-diaster price of a 10 lb. bag of ice is $2.00.  Post-disaster, the price of ice jumps to $20.00 for a ten pound bag (some people just go without, others are willing to pay, and the price settles at $20.00).  But imagine if the government prohibited "price gouging," and din't allow  ice to legally be sold at any price above $2.00.  That means that anyone who values the ice at $2.00 will buy the ice.  But that just means that we're back to shortages, and now no one but the first few people to buy ice will get to have it.  Everyone else is out of luck, and since no more ice can be made, the supply cannot be replenished.     But imagine if the market were left alone, and the price system allowed to work.  Ice would go for $20.00 a bag, and those who don't want it for that price would go without (as they would anyway under the status quo).  But those who did value it at that price (say, those with wounds who might pay much more) would have it available.  If that were the end of the story, it would be enough to justify "gouging."  But the story gets even better!  Since no disaster takes out the capabilities of everyone everywhere to make ice, there is an incentive for other people to truck ice into the affected areas, and start selling the ice for a profit.  But every time another selfish profit-maximizer comes into town, the supply of ice is increased.  And if demand is constant, and supply is increased, then the price will drop.  This will continue until the marginal cost of bringing ice into the diaster area exceeds the marginal benefit.  In other words, the price will continue to drop, and more people will get to use ice, until the price drops back down to approximately pre-disaster levels.  And, all the while, people's needs are being consistently satisfied.  Everyone is better off!    Memo to the self-proclaimed do-gooders.  Next time a hurricane hits my hometown, do us all a favor:  shut the fuck up and leave us alone.    **Update**  David Brown has an article that extends the reasoning of this post over at Mises.org.   urlLink Check it out.
