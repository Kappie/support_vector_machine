IMPORTANT NEWS: my mums friends son is going to italy to play for englands under 16 rugby!  i've got loadsa more stuff 2 write but im all mixed up and i need to like, sort them out first...  btw... im thinking of telling someone at my new school about being gay.. do u think i shud? make a comment or email me!  james xx
