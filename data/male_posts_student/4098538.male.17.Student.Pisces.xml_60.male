I left at dinner and went to Mandy's college to help her with some of her work. I was there from about 1.00 until about 6.30! Anyway, it was kinda nice. I found myself being extremely patient all day which is something kinda new to me. That night, after we went to Mandy's, we went to see San Francisco thrashers, EXODUS! We got there half way through the first support bands set, Re-Aktor. I thought they were really damn good. Next band up were Hatesphere. They were your average fast guitar, fast drums, screaming band. I am getting bored of the unoriginal metal scene. But next up were Exodus! They played an amazing set despite being on a tiny stage and the fact they only played to about 150 people! I was just stood at the side with Mandy all night, holding her close, looking after her. After the show I met every member of Exodus and got my ticket signed by them! The next day I had to go to college and put up 'the best of' my work from the course for the exhibition. I'm kinda proud of it. That night I went to see the one and only FEAR FACTORY! Supports came from i-(def)-i and Johnny Truant. Both weren't bad. But Fear Factory were amazing. They played tons of songs, along with my favourite tracks, 'Replica', 'Cyberwaste' and 'Edgecrusher'. So yeah, that was cool too. I was stood at the back and some mean looking drunk-as-hell headbanger kept swearing at me! I had a day off college on Wednesday so I spent it at Mandy's college. On Thursday I had to go in for the morning to sort some work out. And then I felt sick so I came home, and Mandy come to my house and ended up staying because she missed the last bus home because of some stupid diversion going on at the moment. So I took her to the bus stop this morning and got me some job applications while I was out. And then I got home, and wrote all of this above!
