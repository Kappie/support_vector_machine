When my dad and I went to home depots/lowes to search for PVC pipe, one thing bugged me that made me realize that the world is going down the drain, is that there were no more HOT DOG stands in front of the home depot! WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO?!?!?!?!  Home Depot's hot dogs were the best things EVER!!! You all agree with me, right? I used to hate coming to Home Depot except for the end when we got hot dogs! Now I'm sad.  See?? Didn't that get interesting? I wasn't gonna put it for some stupid reason, but now i've decided to.
