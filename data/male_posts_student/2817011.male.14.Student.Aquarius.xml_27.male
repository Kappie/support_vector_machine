My optimism is on a dangerous low from just all this stuff in the parenting world that kills the Chi and now all I can think of is what will tomorrow bring? How will my life be able to escape from all of this? Why won't they Listen to me once in a while and why can't I smile on my own.   Everytime I think to the past my mind just floats away for a spell. Worries constantly haunting me in my pursuit of happiness. Just want things to be happy, I know nothing lasts forever. . Which is why I can't wait for this evil spell to disappear. Want to see and speak with my friends again. Want Erich to be alright now. Want to be somewhere and stay with ease and no more or this odd pain within me.   It's come to be now that I just barely care anymore. I can only care of getting out and flying away. . .I couldn't care less about my father now, though I see him everyday, it does not change my feelings towards him, yet only makes them worse. . . . Gives me more reason to create a better life for myself and those around me that I love, sadly I barely have any control on either things now. But ah well, must move on Right? Plus, I have been having dreams again, they've been random but have not left me feeling ticked or anything. Even the other night, I dreamt I was flying over an ocean that had a double bridge and it was in NYC, I learned to fly through these two women and created my own simple skills. I think that's one of the happiest moments I've actually had here On My Own and I just hope that I can find ways for that to occur more in these coming weeks. . .  ~*~Arrivederci~*~
