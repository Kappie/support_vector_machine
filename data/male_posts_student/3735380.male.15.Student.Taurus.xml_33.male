When I went home and sat for a while, my dad made me mow the lawn. That's where I got angry. I got almost 4 hours of sleep and I have to mow the lawn. Real fun.  After two hours when I finished, It was about 12:00, so I thought I might watch some TV. I had to go to work in 3 hours.  Work was really dead when I got there. There were no customers. What the heck?! Everyone was making food on their home grill; nobody wanted fast food on a day like this.  So my manager made up for the lack of money by putting us to work.  I had to sweep the floor, mop two different large areas, clean the windows, walls, and change the garbage, scrub the toilets, and sweep and wipe the playland.  After four hours, I was exhausted.  Then it was time for fireworks. I was almost too lazy to tie my shoes. I did it anyway, and when we got to my parents' friends' house, I laid down in a hammock. I was wide awake when I laid down, but I was sleepy when I stood up. That was strange.  Then the fireworks began. I put my chair in the best view possible.  The fireworks were amazing, but then I felt an extreme exhaustion come over me. I felt drowsy and tired, and almost slept through the fireworks.  When I got home, our uncle and aunt came to visit. They wanted to take us to Cedar Point. I agreed, and went to sleep.  In the next sequence of events, my uncle tried to fix a lightbulb, and broke the circuit-breaker. That lost power in my room and in my brother's room, which is why I wasn't able to make a blog until today. The circuit-breaker was broken off, and we needed an electrician to come by soon.  That was the end of the fourth, and I went right to sleep.
