She spent 5 days here (Monday - Friday) and we spent all of Saturday together... and I ended up staying there. Come home this morning drowsy as fuck... I wanna sleep.One of Mandy's mates(Lauren) is being such acunt right now. She thinks that just because I cheated on one of my ex's with her (she was FULLY AWARE I had a girlfriend) that I am going to do it to Mandy, who happens to be one of Lauren's friends.This is how sad she is... she actually spent time making about 10new profiles on Faceparty just to rate me bad things (because Faceparty ratings mean everything obviously). So if anyone I can call a friend is reading this, ignore her. She is a sour little whore that gets used and abused by every male in Manchester. She doesn't understand how close I am to Mandy.
