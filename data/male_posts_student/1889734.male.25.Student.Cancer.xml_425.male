Should public libraries even provide Internet access at all?    I bring this up because of a recent case in Philadelphia, somewhat similar to the Carlie Brucia murder in Flordia.  A homeless man with a past record trapped an eight year old girl in the library bathroom, raped her and nearly choked her to death.  This monster has a previous charge of assault, but was acquitted when the traumatized girl could not identify him beyond doubt.  This loser spends most of this time in the library viewing porn and performing related activities, ahem, in public.  The library position is that they frequently ask him to leave, but cannot ban him from the building as it is a public place.  In the words of the library representative, ‘he did not pose an imminent threat’.  Does that sound familiar?    Anyway, the presence of porn may be incidental to this particular case, but it got me thinking about the issue again.  Why is it even available?  What public interest is served by this access in a public place, on public computers?  And for that matter, why do we even have public Internet access?  There is a USA today article where they interview a library patron on the topic, and he spends most of his time in the library playing games on the net.  Is that a proper use of tax-funded resources?  The official American Library Association (ALA) position opposes filters.  To them, it is a freedom of speech issue.  They feel the Constitution protects the publics right to have access to this material.  Does this also mean that the library should carry other media of this nature?  Magazines, DVDs, tapes etc.?  Does Freedom of Speech compel others to fund speech they don’t wish to be associated with?  What right does the library have to divert public finds to this sort of activity?  I’m not arguing against the popularity of libraries.  Just because people want something doesn’t make it morally sound.  My question revolves around the primary issue of compulsion.  From where do we draw the thinking that access to information is a fundamental right, compelling others to pay for our access?  If someone wishes to engage in questionable viewing on the Internet, why do they think they have the right to do this on public computers?  Let them pay the $19.95 a month and do it in their own home.  If they can’t afford it, well…. that’s his own problem, not mine.  But what about the chilrun!?  I can already hear it.  What of the poor children who want to research Thomas Jefferson and lack access to the Net.  In this case, I fully support a school library system, closed to the public and stocked for the purpose of education.  In that case, I support the availability of access, along with appropriate filters.  I think it is completely appropriate for children to have access to educational material in a library system, but I can’t support a public library system that promotes copyright infringement.  Whoa.  Where did that come from?  Most of you who know me have already heard this argument, so I’ll be brief.  I don’t believe it is correct to make copyrighted material available for free in the public library system.  Sure, it might be funded by tax payers, and the copyright holder may get paid, but they only get paid for limited copies of the text or media.  If I write a novel, why should I permit it to be freely available to anyone who wishes to read it without paying me for the reading?  If someone borrows my book, they are not going to buy a copy, compensating me for my work.  I have lost a sale.  How is that different from Napster, other than the technology?  If an adult wishes to read a book, they should pay for the reading.  Period.  Anything else is theft.  The book contents are not public domain.  Same for movies, art, newspapers and so on.    What public interest is served when I can watch a tape of Star Wars for free at the library?  Is Lucas compensated for that viewing?  How can you morally defend the ongoing ‘theft’ of this material?  So, circling back to school libraries, I have no issue with the availability of source materials to children for the purposes of education.  Kids aren’t going to have the money to spend on the materials, and most content producers would agree that providing this material to this audience is worth doing, since those kids will grow up to be consumers.  Many industries see the wisdom of taking a loss in this market to generate future gains.  Do you think Microsoft gives away Office out of the goodness of their heart, or do they want kids to grow up ‘locked in’ to MS software?  It makes sense.  Therefore, I don’t believe in public libraries.  And I certainly don’t believe in Internet access.  Flame away, because I would love to hear the moral justification for taking public funds to erect buildings dedicated to stealing from content creators.
