Well, ok, we saw dawn of the dead.  Ya, like a remake/expansion movie thing that has to do with zombies.  Now, i have to admit, it was a good movie and all, but i dun think it was worth fucking 10 dollars.  Anyway, um, the usual group plus 2 showed up.  It was basically, all antioch people, and Mike H., and Dave.  All together, there was about..................10 of us, me, andy, dave, mike, rob, scott, jorge, hernie, Steph, and sabby.  Ya, pretty big group.  Um, we made the usual jokes and shit, but becuase of them black folk', and there loudness, they reuined alot of the movie, especially for robs dad i heard.  So ya, i guess it couldn've been better if some people stoppped being so scared, and had to make it up by being loud. um....well, ya, there not much i can say about being annoyed by my freinds like david said he went through.  I guess we dun care cause were so used to it, so, ya, sucks for him i guess. Me and jorge were fairly quite, um, sabby had to yell acouple of times for some reason, and the farthers i got down the row was like, about 4 seats down from me, which was andy...after that, i couldn't hear/see anyone else.  i think i was the only one to acutally go to the bathroom during the movie now that i think about it, which is kinda cool, and i farted like 3 times.....it was awsome, i spread my cheeks to not make noise, and i hit them with a super secret stealth fart that didn;t even stink....ya, i'm that good.  ok, maybe i didn;t do that, but i have nothing more to type.....i went to sleep late, wooke up like 4 times today, and i kinda fucked up parellel parkin at lessons today.  To add to that, my parents are like, o we juss gonna get some bags, and we;ll bring home food and shit...turns out they went to manhatten again, and aren't coming home for awhile....my breakfast so far was one of the frozen snickers bar and some V8 Splash.  Ya, so i have a big headache.....well, what else is supose to happen...i still have most of my APUSh to do...it's not hard, juss alot of work, and i'm going over to benny's.....i'm juss gonna bring over my shit to antioch tonight....see, cause it were going at 6:30 to write thankyou letters and what not.  Um, ya, nothing more to say.....i've been looking for some shit to read, and the only people that still update there blogs that i can see are dave and Jones.  I've read davids recent entry, but i won;t comment...and jones'  away message reads that he's updating, but he;s most likely playing a game.  NOTHING INTRESTING TO READ! NOOO!!! well, ya, i'm juss gonna head over to bens house and order some chinese food.....i might add another entry.... ADD  being the main word there......... ?
