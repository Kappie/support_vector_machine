Got up, went downstairs and loaded the car. Dad tried to whip me with a towel. I ran to the car hopped in and fell asleep for about 8 hours off and on. I finally woke up at 1 and we were a short way from Georgia. The longest freakin state i've ever been through.   We have stopped in a couple of small towns for gas and at a couple of rest stops. I tossed my contacts out the window somewhere in hicksville kentucky. Got breakfast at McDonalds(omg) in the middle of nowhere(Tennessee)  I think I might have already gone insane if it werent for my precious cd player. pretty much been listening to thursday "full collapse" and brand new "your favorite weapon". there is absolutely nothing to do. All my games have been beaten multiple times, all of my cds past their prime. I cant even read a book, I tossed my contacts out the window.   7pm  Were almost in Tally which is our first destination of three on our trip. We got delayed by construction for two hours. my mom said we lost 2 houors while I was asleep, well I want them back. This place shouldnt be too bad. tons of video games. 6 cats to torture, not gonna find a dull moment here.
