Today was crazy.  I remember hearing Coldplay playing on my CD player at 5 in the morning.  I still don't know how to turn off that auto-time play feature.  I'd have to take out all the CDs in the player if I don't want it to play.  I really don't feel like doing that all the time, or I forget.  Therefore I wake up to my favorite band at 5 am.  Speaking of Coldplay, I just got their new CD today.  It came out today, and I'm happy to say that I got it the first day, about 10 minutes before Best Buy closed.  I got it for $10.99!  Great buy, I think.  Anyways, I woke up pretty early to turn off the player.  I slept a bit more only to wake up to my alarm at 6:53.  I hit the snooze button 3 times I think then I just turned the alarm off.  I got up at about 7:30.  Went to school.  Everything fine until about 4th hour.  I then realized how tired I was.  I was on the verge of dozing off.  Went to lunch only to find that there were virtually no seats available.  I still got to sit by my home dogg, Spif.  That was weird, because I had to sit on the end of a table with is lame.  Anywho, 5th hour wasn't too bad.  I was pretty awake the whole time dispite the fact that we were watching a movie with the lights off.  6th hour rolls around, and I'm then tired.  I was dozing off left and right.  I was just glad to get out of the class awake.  Football next... I guess I was pretty awake by then.  I got to leave a little early though for driver's education.  That seemed like forever.  I finally get home at about 8:30.  That's a pretty long day, I think.  And tomorrow it all starts again.  (minus football practice and driver's ed)  Hah.  Good night.
