The other effects of it were nice but the sleeping part sucked.  Tyke got up at noon but he thought it was 11 at first.  Then he realized his folly and went "Arrrrrr...eeesshhhh."  But then he showered etc. and went upstairs.  His parents were leaving to go to a birthday party for most of the day so Tyke ended up having the house to himself basically until he left for Refuge at night.  He washed his car at like 5 and did his usual job of it when he washes his car by himself.  It's much easier to wash a car with more than one person.  So Tyke washed his car like his car-washing motto suggests: "Cleaner than it was."  It's not sparkly clean but it's nice.  And the inside windows got cleaned so that makes a pretty big difference to Tyke while driving.  After that he just fiddle-faddled around the house until Refuge.  Tina and Dotti picked up Tyke and they headed out.  Tina's car smelled bad because of the hoses that were left in there from the car wash and a puddle of dirty water was left in the trunk which left a pungent stench in the car and then during Refuge Tyke and Tina got a whiff of it again but they couldn't figure out why.  But Refuge was pretty good.  It was about doubters and skeptics and Tyke very much related to Kyle's views and such.  This was one time where Tyke did fully understand the message.  So that was neat for Tyke.  After Refuge Tyke came home and has been talking online to Kinker, Tyronius, Amed, Skippy, Commander Cool for a little, and Tank for a little.  Unfortunately, Tyke has traffic court tomorrow but hopefully it isn't too bad.  It probably won't be.  The Reason by Hoobastank is stuck in Tyke's head now.  But it's a good song.  There is also a girl stuck in Tyke's head now too.  At least one.  Maybe there is even two.  Or three...or...
