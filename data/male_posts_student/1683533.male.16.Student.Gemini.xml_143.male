It sucked for the first couple hours cause I forgot to take my medicine until late into the day, so I felt kinda woozy and not feeling much like working.  We didnt have much to do so we just talked and messed around near the end. At one point all the guys were in the freezer trying to punch holes in the frie boxes, it was one of those you had to be there moments, then one of the pussy waitress girls turned off the lights to it from the outside, and Tank started screaming like a girl which was funny even though he was joking.  Afterwards, I called my dad and asked if he would pick me up a half hour later cause I wanted to listen to some music Tank had in his car. It was a hardcore festival. I have renewed appreciation for hardcore. Alot of people hate hardcore cause either they here the stupid shit or they are mad at the screaming. You really have to look behind it the insane musicianship behind it. There are some points where I dont know what time measure it is in but it isnt like just a bunch of random noise, it has a time signature I just cant figure it out some of it is so complex. Some songs were in 5/4, some in 3/8. It was pretty crazy. Some people call it "Math rock" because you need to be very mentally prepared to play some of the stuff it has so many different time signatures. Tank let me borrow two CDs:  Fordirelifesake: it is an earlier cd, they soun so fucking raw and unproduced but they still manage to pull off some dope break-downs. They are really tight.  The Mars Volta: Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers is the bass player in this band, they are extremely talented. Sometimes the vocalist sounds like a pussy singing really high and shit, but othertimes it sounds really good.  Anyways, I am gonna watch the 4th volume of the Sopranos and then go to bed and then work on the history project
