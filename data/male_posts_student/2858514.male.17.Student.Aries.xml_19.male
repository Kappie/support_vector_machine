Anyway, staying at home means I can concentrate on thinking what I'm going to do.   As usual, I turned on my computer and surf on the Internet. After looking at some web sites, I started the Visual C++. Thinking for a while, I decided to write a quicksort function in C++ language. The procedure was smooth but the testing program just didn't give the correct result. I tracked the program for after half an hour I found the error is an "if" statement. After correcting this error, the program finally gave out correct results.   In the afternoon, I read a computer magazine and discovered an interesting program called ArtRage. It is a drawing program which likes the simplified version of Painter. I downloaded and installed it. The program ran fast and the interface is simple. It has serveral drawing tools like pencils, oil paint, etc. As my drawing technique is extremely poor, I just scribbled for a while. This program is really great, it is very realistic. So I think I'll recommend it to people who like drawing.   This afternoon I opened my Additional Mathematics textbook and started to do some questions about conics. Few weeks ago I finished reading parabolas so I did some questions to familiarise with it. Luckily I haven't forgotten all my maths, I'm still able to do the questions, but the speed is quite low. Speed isn't important at the moment, themost important thing is to understand.   Many people on the Internet argued that working at I. T. industry is not good sincewe need to learn new things all thetime. I agree with them but I'll still set programmer as mytarget. I like programming, sohaving a job that one's like is the best. Although programming technologies changes all the time, it won't be too difficult to learn since the fundamental things are thesame.   This is the longest post I've ever posted.Hope I canwrite posts as long as this one in the future.
