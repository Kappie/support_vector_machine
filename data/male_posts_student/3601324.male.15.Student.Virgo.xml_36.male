Also, alot of cool Japanese culture stuff. Including a little scene of anime! However, you don't really know what's going on at all in this "volume". It's like, "Oh, she was going to get married. Oh, she didn't. Oh, people hate her. OH, SAMURAIS." I can only hope that the second one has some explanations. Also, someone needs to tell Tarantino how blood works. Because it most certainly doesn't erupt from wounds like volcanoes, as he depicts in this movie. Overall, odd movie. I'm still going to watch the other one though. ;)
