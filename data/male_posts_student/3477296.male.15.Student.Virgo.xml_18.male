But dat light often gets dimmed by constant losing...  3rd Grade Soccer - Lost 2-1 to Epping 3rds Solo goal to Alex. Fairly decent performance  2nd Table Tennis - Lost to Epping 2nds Supposedly murdered. (Thnx Benlee)  15s Hockey - Lost 7-1 to Epping 15's THRASHED, OBLITERATED, etc.  So as one can see, our skool is quite crap at sport. I think da word "victory" got ripped out wen dey were handing free, yes dats da only ones we can afford, dictionaries to da skool.  N yes, we get our reports 2moro...WATCH THIS SPACE!!!
