It's been manifesting itself (for want of a better term) for near on 6 years with boyfriends and girlfriends, flings and other stuff. I know I won't truly know what I am until I'm say 20, but I can't stand the constant change of opinion, so I have to deal with this whole thing once and for all. Think of it as a never ending isle of sweets with unsupervised children, and waiting for them to hence reach a conclusion of true nirvana, and you understand my longitudinal dilema.  I don't think I love a girl I thought I did once. I guess if the weekend had a moral - that would be it. Well really it's been a 3 day weekend with the bank holiday and all, saw Anna and others, went to green fair and saw loads of folk I haven't seen in ages like Nikki and Tom and Bronwen. Was fun. Today however I've done a 7-4 shift and tomorrow I have a 9-6 shit planned YAY.  Well I guess I'll just have to trust a lot more people with the whole sexuality stuff. Well the one poor sole who from what I gather regularly visits this blog is in for a strange literary sensation tonight when finishing this sentence which I'm going to make you suffer by not stopping haha askdfjaskfafshaf *hides in embarrassment* xBuBzx
