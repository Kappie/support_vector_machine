About 1/2 hour after I posted my first post, I was out, and someone slammed into the back of my mom's new car while I was driving.  I was at a stop light, and the guy hit me.  Only a couple scratches and dings (it's a 2004 Nissan 350Z, for the record).  The guy's insurance is paying for it, and other than that, I think that's it.  So, I've spent the whole day sulking.  I'm scared to death to get back on the road.  I'm not even sure if I want to go to my driving days for drivers ed.  I'll end up going, but, I'm definitely a little less self-confident for driving.  I did fine on the interstate yesterday, but noooo...everything has to happen in Inglis (a couple months ago, the brakes on my parents Suburban, which they no longer have, broke, and had to be fixed...in Inglis).  So maybe I just won't drive in that town anymore.  There wasn't really anymore stuff to talk about, so...that's it.  Enjoy.
