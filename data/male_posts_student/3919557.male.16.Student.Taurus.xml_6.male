That family was so annoying.  Sarah and me couldn't stand them.  They kept on standing up throughout the ride.  They had thier little girl with them who was annoying.  Anyways though...  We didn't get to cedar point untill like 12, which up set me a little.  Well Sarah and me went off on our own and started with the Raptor.  It was a nice one to start our with.  After that we went to brave the Millenium Force.  It was so awesome.  We rode second car and we held our hands up.  Sarah screamed so loud I couldn't stop laughing.  Our picture turned out hott so we each bought one.  Then we rode the Mantis, Power Tower, Demon Drop, and Disaster Transport which were all okay.  We also rode the Mean Streak which was fun especially we got to enjoy the company of BethAnne freaking out on it. haha  The last one we rode was the Magnum.  The Magnum and Millenium are my favorite rides.  The Magnum was so much fun, I always laugh on it.  The sad part of the trip was that I didn't get to ride Top Thrill Dragster.  I was so disapointed, there was a 4 hour wait.  I still had a good time though.   We didn't get home until 4 in the morning.  I slept the whole way from Ohio to BayCity.  It was nice.  It didn't get up until 11:30 today.  I don't know what I am going to do today.  I might practice my trumpet or go to Sarah's to make some copies of music.  Who knows? I can do whatever I want today as long as it doesn't cost money.  I am broke from Cedar Point.  It is so sad.  Well hey I am going to go.
