All I can say is that my life is pretty plain ya don't like my point of view ya think I'm insane Its not sane......it's not sane.  I just want someone to say to me oh, oh, oh I'll always be there when you wake Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today So stay with me and I'll have it made  (I'll have it made I'll have it made You know we're really gonna, really gonna have it made Gonna have it made ahhh,ahhh, ahhh, ahhh)   The lyrics are a little strange but fun to sing when your with your friends having a good time. which brings me to what this post is going to focus on. "The Pretty Kitties" A LONG time ago like seriously 8 years ago I had a group of like 3 friends. And we were going off on how gangs were silly so we came up with this fake gang called the "pretty kitties". Anyways here is a list of some of the more commonly known members.  Tim,Mike,Matt,Tara,Teresa and I.  Thoes were like the main members but as years go by things have changed. I no longer hang out with a few of them as much as in the past and there are plenty of new "Pretty kitty" members now. Infact there are alot of members now, so being that gang is well established and every thing is going fine and every one is "equal" in status. Well as I listed before there are 2 people up there in the list that are still top members of the gang. Mike and Tim.  Mike and Tim have been my friends for many years and we decided to establish another part of the gang. A more underground secret part that is most of the time up to no good as long as it benefits them selfs. I wont go into detail excpet when the triforce is at its best, your probably getting screwed. ( I just read what i put down and it sounds so stupid AHAHA but All i can say is good times)    Mike: Very cool guy, he is him self and no one can change him. He has been the same crazy guy that I have known from the first day I met him. Just by how he dresses and how he acts. Been friends with him for about a long time. He is for sure one of my best friends all though he is a scandalis scandanavian. We have had a lot of good times together and there is still alot more to come. Later days  Tim: where to start with Tim? Tim man If you ever read this, much love. We have been through so much shit together and I mean hard core shit. somethings poeple will never know about we went through and we are still alive and doing well. We have been through so much problems with each other but we have always been in it together. You have litteraly been my best friend longer then any one. I cant stress enough how much diffrent my life would be and would have been with out you, who knows it could have been better or worse but to be honest. I have had so much fucking fun I would not trade it for money. (Unless it was like a million$ becuase then we could party for a long time :) The thing is, I know you would say the same about me. We feed off each other for better or worse and its tight that way. I litteraly look to you as a brother.   Luke: Luke O man, Danm you are tight. As all my other friends you are your own person and do your own thing, dont care about poeple around you really as in what they think about you. If your having fun, its all good. Known you for quite a while. FUCK something just came up so I guess you only get this.  Got to go hook up some speakers and subs for Jeff, he is a noob.
