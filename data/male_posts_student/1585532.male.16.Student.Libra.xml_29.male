With trip number 3 on the horizon and my maze slowly progressing to it's final stage, it looks like everything is going the way it should be.  Though I do feel like a 18 wheeler has ran me over a few times and I still have the smell of fog on me...heh.  Musta been a craaaaaazy night last night!  I remember most of it.  Anyways, I  HIGHLY  recommend Haunt if you live in SoCal somewhere near Knott's.  You want a badass fun time full of scares, screams, and laughs?  Go to Haunt.  Go.  To.  Haunt.  Anyways, I'm gonna go shower all this fog smell off me, it's realllly starting to creep me out.  Ta.
