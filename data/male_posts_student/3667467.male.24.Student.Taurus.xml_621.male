Because we were late for  The Bourne Supremacy , that's why.  But it was a great film; we laughed, we cried, we sang Carly Simon songs.  I highly recommend it.  Then we went to a Ferguson Family post-wake party and filled up with Pigs in a Blanket.  THEN we watched  SNL: Best of Will Farrell  and called it a night.  It was one of those nights where you just end up doing stuff and they miraculously end up being really fun.  But Pigs in a Blanket are highly overrated; stick with the Triscuits and cheese.
