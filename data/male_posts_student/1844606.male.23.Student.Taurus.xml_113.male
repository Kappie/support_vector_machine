They don't respect the drummers awesome abilities and have no concept of how long and arduous recoding can be.  And the fact that if I don't have to be around my roommate I won't be cause I can't stand his ways.  I'm going to start making a list of all the insipid questions my father asks me in a given period of 24 hours.  My feeling is that he has like 10 of them stored an hour and if you aren't there for that hour, they carry over.  I've already defeated Metal of Honor: Killing J***  Solid game, just wish there was more to it.  Of course when you play about 6 hours a night cause you can't sleep, things seem to move quicker.    My roommate is going down to school for New Years.  Originally I thought it was to just drink but the real reason is he wants to get gifts from his girlfriend.  And I'm sick of hearing updates about her broken vagina.  That and I'm not too sympathetic to his cries of not getting any.  On the bright side I got a Christmas card from a girl I knew few years ago and she wants to catch up.  I go into this with a bit of skepticism but it was a nice gesture none the less.
