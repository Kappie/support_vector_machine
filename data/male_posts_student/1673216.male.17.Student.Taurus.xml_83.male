A fish thast is smimming in all sorts of crazy patters all over the place. Kathrin just asked why Scott declared war on me. I say...I don't know. Hah. You're funny. This is my blog. Welcome. If this is your first time reading...No, I am not stupid. Yes I know how to write paragraphs. This is just how my mind works. Incomplete thoughts and stuff. No sentences finished...I see...my prom picture pasted to her computer screen!!! Cool!! Gotta go, everyone is going to bed and I feel awkward being the guest...And not leaving!! Hah  ---------------------------Later---------------------------  Ok...Home now. It's only 10:40 PM...Woah! This is so great! 10:40 is late for me now! My life was so fucked up before....Every night until 2:00 AM on the computer...And now, I just feel great going to bed at 11...Woah...This is a huge deal for me people. I've been so messed up with the computer the past few years of my life..It's completely ruined parts of me. Then again, I have learned a lot. Um...Anyway... ^^, I feel great is all. I can honestly say, without lying, that I've  never  felt so great in my life. Echt.    Thanks =)
