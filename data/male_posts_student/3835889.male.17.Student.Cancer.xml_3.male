Know why I said that? Well first when I went for my driving lessons at 9am, the instructor pulled off a stunt on me and force me into I-10 ( A highway similar to Spore expressway, but muz move at a faster speed). I got the hell out of my life as I have to speed up to 75mph (abt 120km/h) but I onli managed to push the car to 72mph (114km/h) and boy, this sure is the first time that I drove a vehicle at such high speed. Wow man it sure is a totally new experience for me. And tomorrow it will be my final lessons, and I will get my graduated license whereby I can drive alone without anybody sitting beside me...     I was so bored that I played GB after my lessons...Then I didn't know what to do nxt so I went to the gym...That made me even more tiring...Well I had a birthday dinner wif my family at church's chicken ( something like KFC) and then head back home after that. Watched independence day on TV, then come online to type this stupid blog...hahaxz guess I was so tired that I need to sleep liaoxz...Happy 17th Birthday to Me!~ (^U^)
