We took on a little bit of water, and had lightning that filled the whole house.  So, yeah, it was literally one hell of a storm.  Well, after that accident I had the other day, they've gotten me back on the road, and in Inglis, too.  I'm not as scared now, and I feel like I'm driving even better than I was before.  But, if you didn't see it before, I got hit in Inglis, in my mom's car, and it put a few little dents in the back end.  But, that's all fixed now, and I'm recovering from first time accident-itis.    So, anyway, my day has been so boring, that this post could actually be Absolute Boredism Vol. III, but, I didn't feel like it.  So, I didn't.   I watched a couple of my favorite movies before that storm blew through, particularly Anger Management and School of Rock.  I'd watch Pirates of the Caribbean tonight, but, I'm just too damn tired.  I gotta find something to do on Monday...I'm tired of just sitting around.  My bagel.tech posts are going to be earlier in the day, because I want to spend my afternoons doing something that is worth posting about on the blog.  I want to start taking pictures again.  Pretty soon, I'm going to start publishing some of my favorite pictures that I took from this past baseball season at my school.  I was the team photographer, and traveled with the team all year and took pictures at all the games.  I want to find something new to take pictures of, and show them to the world via Blogger.  This whole Hello thing is very interesting, and it will bring some awesome new ideas to me and this blog.  Expect more photo-based posts in the near future.  The countdown continues for Spiderman 2.  I still have plans to go to Universal on Wednesday to see the movie in a real, non-tented movie theater.  I'm picking up the videogame on Tuesday.  Expect a different format for bagel.tech then, because it's going to be all about Spiderman 2.    My speakers on my computer are broken, so now I gotta go look for new ones.  I'm not quite sure what exactly happened, but, they just cut out on me, and I couldn't watch anything on Shockwave.  Irritates me.  Well, I'm going to get off for the night.  I'm rather tired. I drove to Cedar Key, and it was very tiresome.  So, until tomorrow, be sure to sign the guestbook, leave some comments, or do whatever.  But, make it look like someone looks at this blog.
