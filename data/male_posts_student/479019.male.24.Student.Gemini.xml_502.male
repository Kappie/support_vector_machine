Ah the memories... it got me stoked about going to Europe next summer with Steff, Mike and Cissa.   Oh yea... last night had another dream about that certain someone. This time she led me to a smoothie shop and then ditched me. I really don't understand why I dream about her so much. I think I've probably dreamed about her more than any young lady... it's just strange. It's strange cause I normally don't dream of people I know... or people I know are playing different characters than themselves.   Today I plan on reading that consumerism book and try to get some exercise in.  ***
