Something like that happened to me on monday, come to think of it.  I'd walked into school, and was half way to my locker when it actually occured to me, I wasn't thinking, I was just following routine.  No thought entered my mind, until I heard the oh so lovely sound of a black girl screaming at some guy and suddenly snapped back into conciousnes.  It really had me irked the start of first period.  But that was yesterday.  Today, I really actually changed routine.  So I'm glad, it sounds like I'm crazy, because I don't want to go into detail, but needless to say, I'm looking forward to a very happy week.  Oh yeah.  I'm such a strange person.  Naiomba.
