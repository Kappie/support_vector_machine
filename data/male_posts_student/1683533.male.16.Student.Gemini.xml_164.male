For any of you who dont know  Champ Elysses     (pronounced: Shamp El-lee-say-s...i think)  is a street in Paris.  And she got me a shirt that said that.  It works out perfectly because it is a very cool  NOFX  song too!  She also got me some   crazy french candy  .  I rented  Driver 3 .  It was...okay.  I played for a day and then got bored with it.  It is insanely difficult in that once you fail you dont really feel like trying again.  So, I decided to just use a cheat to unlock all the missions, and I watched all the cut scenes and called it a day.  However, the graphics were amazing.  Today I returned it and got  The Suffering.   So far it is ok, but I dont know why I got it cause I never really had a thing for horror/survival games.  I have been renting these games from Chart Hits Video (previously was Video Jack until it closed a month or so ago or something)  I am very happy with this new place, Video Jack had very outdated games and rarely picked up new ones, so they barely had a selection.  Also when my mom renewed our membership at this new place, she forgot to put restrictions on my membership, so I can get whatever I want when I go by myself >:) muhahaha.  I went to the spree on wensday and it was fun.  I saw ben and brandon and nolfo there, but I couldnt stay long after Kate left because I had to clean up my house.  We are gonna start filming another movie this week, one with an actual storyline, and if it is good enough maybe we can send it into an independent movie thing or something.  It will be fun though.  Kate left for a week today :( and I miss her already.  yesterday was our  6 month  though yay! wow, half a year :D  I m  g o n n a  g o  n o w , b y e
