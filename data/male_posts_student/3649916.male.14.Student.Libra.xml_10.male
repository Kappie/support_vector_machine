Well i have to type fast before my dad comes out and threatens to unplug internet because its 3:20am. I have not done anything much in the past week exactly lol. I have talked to many people and even went to the river a few times. I found out i cannot swim in too cold of water because of my asthma which really sucks, and the best girl ever is moving away from squamish on sunday which is the worst. Alot of my friends went to warped tour. My friends have been making me kinda feel uncomfortable because some of them have started smoking pot and i do not do that anymore, and i wont do it again, because i dont want to fuck up my life again. its a waste of time if you ask me. I saw Cold Mountain today it was really good movie, and even saw tons of old movies in the past week, had a movie night all night one day hehehe. This weekend at my dads is shorter then usual because he must work on sunday which sucks. I go home tomorrow at 2 pm so i better be getting to bed shortly hehe. My best friend is in Alberta for a week or two so i am stuck alone for awhile lol this will suck, well not that much i will get to play UO alot hehe. Yeah i have been playing that alot, even made 4 tailors lol, can make alot of money out of that. Well i think i will go do my BOD run and goto bed (bulk order deed). Talk to you later  Chris
