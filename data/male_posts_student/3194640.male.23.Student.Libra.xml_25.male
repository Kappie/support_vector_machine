It's strange, but good (plus, you need to understand why I think I'm so clever). It start of my paper, I decided to use a lyric from Bob Dylan's "Rainy Day Women": "Everybody must get stoned." Read the story, then you'll understand why I chose that quote. I found it amusing anyway.  I was talking about the peacock this morning at work and somone else said they had seen it too. I'm glad someone else has seen it too. Now I can confirm that I'm not crazy.
