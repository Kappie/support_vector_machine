It seems that this book was Ayn Rand's first presentation of her original philosophy, known as Objectivism, which created controversy when the book was first published in 1943. I had already read another book by her,  The Anthem , last year after I found it sitting around the house one day. It was short enough that I decided to read it purely out of curiosity. Just as  The Fountainhead , the book dealt with the importance of the individual.    The Fountainhead  is about an architect, Howard Roark, his battle against conventional standards, and his love affair with a woman who struggled to defeat him. Roark is shown as the ideal man because of his talent, courage, and struggle to remain true to himself. He believes that "individual creators are the fountainhead of civilization." Every one of the novel's main characters struggles to act independently, and the desire to do so becomes the greatest quality a character can possess. The author basically illustrates that society has a dependent mentality, and individuals must act selfishly in order to be free.   Although I don't agree with some of the ideas that I found in the book, it still makes many great points and forces you to think about how dependent our society can be.
