I have a few cousins who graduated from there and they had a great time. I toured the campus a bunch of times.....the dorms are okay but it's a LONG hilly walk between buildings. The campus is literally on the side of a mountain and Binghamton has some of the worst weather, even worse than Albany. You're not going to find much to do downtown either. The tradeoff for that is it's probably the best of the SUNY's academic-wise. The reason I turned down Binghamton is because they didn't have my major. If they did have my major it would have been a really tough call between Binghamton or UAlbany...  Stony Brook: I don't know much about the school but I'd rather stick needles in my eyes than drive on Long Island. Have you ever driven there? It fucking sucks. Everyone probably goes home on the weekends due to the school's proximity to the city and the rest of Long Island...  Albany seems to be a good choice with all those scholarships and the Honors Program. Albany has great academics if you're majoring in any of the sciences, humanities, or criminal justice fields. It's one of the top research universities in the nation, and it has a great graduate school if you're planning on more than a bachelor's degree. I'll admit that Albany's dorms kind of suck ass but if you're in the Honor's Program they have Honors halls on State Quad with much nicer dorms (so I've heard). When you're a junior you have the option of renting an apartment downtown or living on Empire Commons (soooooo nice). The atmosphere up here is laid back.....you'll make alot of friends quickly and you'll find yourself chillin in other people's suites half the time. The weather sucks just like Binghamton; cold, long, snowy winters with alot of wind. But the whole campus is connected with underground tunnels so you don't have to walk outside if you don't want to. Downtown Albany is awesome.....there's alot of bars that you can get in with a chalked ID. Plenty of keggers at the frat houses. The city itself is really nice too; there's pretty much every store and restaurant that you can think of within a 3 mile radius of UAlbany. Buses are free too. Only a 1 hour 45 minute drive from Rockland.....a really easy drive up the Thruway.  I love Albany, it's a great school and I'm glad I chose it. Binghamton is a good option as well. The choice is yours.....good luck.  -BIGsmut
