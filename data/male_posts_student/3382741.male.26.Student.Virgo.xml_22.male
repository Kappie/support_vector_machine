I made more doing one hour of work for my uncle (as a contractor) than I would have made if I felt up to going to work today.  (I have been sick and just didn't feel like making a long boring drive just to be bored at work for 5 hours and still only make a grand totaly of $37 that almost $10 of which would have been eaten up by gas to get there).  I need to do something about this work sitch.  My sister was in a wreck today.  Seems she was speeding and hydro planed (sp?) on a wet road and hit a building.  She is OK, but is going to be rather sore for a while.  Her car, on the other hand, is rather a mess.  I have been in my share of wrecks so I know what she is going thru.  I went to see her and other than feeling very sick and not being able to even keep water down yet, she is fine.  I know tis not going to be fun at all for her trying to get all this taken care of.  I have been talking with one of my newer friends about RPG's.  So I have been telling him all about EQ .. it has soo made me want to play again.  Unfortuanetly (grr i know that is not spelled right but I refuse to bother with it enough to care)  Steve is no longer keeping my account active.  This means I can't get online at all unless I cough up some money to reinstate the account.  I am thinking I may start it back up for a month and see if I can have any fun with the new featurs.  Something to do since I no longer have much to desire to chat.  Hmm well guess that is all i have for now .....
