Which, of course, means the kids didn't come to school for any other reason than to put on face paint, eat lunch, and prepare for a full ninety minutes of foot-stomping on the bleachers during the end-of-the-day gym rally. I competely disagree with the idea that children have a short attention span, because if you saw how much time and care they spent in applying glitter....Anyway, it was a lucky coincidence that the day I decide to wear a red shirt is the day I'm called in to a school whose colors are red, whose mascot is an Indian chief, and who practically made crimson clothes a one-day law for students and faculty. Go Chiefs, dude. Go Chiefs.
