It's absolutly crazy.   I read an artical in The Columbian the other day saying by2005 (or 6, can't quite remember), every city (with the exception of Yacolt, heh heh) in Clark Countywill be expanding and recieving almost double the traffic of what they are seeing now. The article also says that Vancouver and Battle Ground will see the most change.  That's insane. I cannot imagine driving in worse traffic than what we have now. Then again, we'll all be in College (except for Felix, that lazy bum.), so I guess it doesn't really affect us.
