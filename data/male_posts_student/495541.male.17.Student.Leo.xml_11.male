That would have done a lot better, I think.  Whatever would help.  Coffee would help but I don't like coffee.  It tastes like dirt.  I had some cold coffee once, I wanted to puke it up.  Made me do that shiver thing when you taste something that just is so bad.  So a couple days ago I started this thing in my profile called page two.  I'm not sure what I'm going to be putting into it.  Anything really.  I'm just waiting for someone to suggest something.  I just added a song of the moment thing.  That probably won't last long.  Too hard to update.  I'm going to go play some Counter-Strike on the new Counter Assassins server.  Until later.
