Let us hope none of my friends are reading this, and not very likely either, since I have only a few friends who use the net, and those who use... well they use it once in a while, and I am sure that they haven't heard of blogs. But being a bit cautious never hurt anyone.  Anyway, her name is .... well, no names. She is beautiful to me, and some people say she is alright, certainly not someone hot and sizzling. She is the most caring person I have ever known, and very understanding. I first saw her about 6 years ago, and since then I have been attracted towards her, even though I saw many other girls who were more beautiful, hot etc, I always returned to her within a few days or at the most a few weeks. Our first 2 years were almost forgettable. I still remember the first time she addressed me, and the fight we soon had. It was a slow recovery from that fight. And at the end of the 2 years we were back to friends, atleast I was.  I still don't know how she feels about me. Does she consider me as a friend or does she just tolerates me? I may never know the answer.  She was the only person who talked to me during my difficult times, guided me when I was lost and showed empathy when I was hurt. Maybe that is why I love her.  I have to say she is popular, very popular. Got a lot of friends who dot on her, and are ready to make sacrifices for her.   It is difficult to point out a specific reason or some specific reasons why I love her. I just do. And more I know her the more I love her.  But the saddest part is that, she has no idea how I feel about her. And I intent to keep it that way. Due to various reasons, some of which I won't explain, there is no chance that I can ever marry her. One of the main reasons why I have never told her about my feelings is that, she deserves much better than me, and she is sure to get someone better. I love her, but that doesn't mean i expect love in return, I would be happy if she is happy. And that is all I care about.  Would I ever be able to love again? I have no idea. During the 6 years after I have met her, I have never been able to feel such feels towards anyone else. I have caught myself comparing other girls to her, and they never measure up to the standard set by her.  I would consider myself extremely lucky, if I am able to fall in love again. But I hope I never fall in love again. This feeling is something which I would want to cherish till the last day of my life, even if it means I will never marry. The feeling is so divine, that I hope, it never fades.
