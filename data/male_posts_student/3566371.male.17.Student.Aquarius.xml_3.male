Now the had good music, people, cool lights, an sms-wall, pictures taken that appeared on a screen immediatly. Too bad there was no alcohol. It took some time for the party got really started. But after that. Glad I went. I went with Arno. A friend. I useally don't speak to him much. He's nice though. And he likes to party. I'm not really the partyanimal (no, really, I mean it). I really should learn to dance. I met Albert there. I really should go more often to these kind of things. But then there was this slow song. Made me feel down. And the whole party confused me actually. I saw really nice girls and no boys of such. It got me thinking if I were bi, maybe not. Maybe it's just a phase. How can people like Jamai (17-year old boy who won Idols, admitted to be gay in public) know these things for sure. I hope I've got stuff to do in the upcoming holiday. My mood is greatly affected by how many things I've to do.
