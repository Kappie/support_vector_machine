First period, I went to play some piano... turns out I'm kinda rusty-ish...^^;; which is expected, but I guess I can improve with practise... plus never played duet before. Let'see... second period I spent studying for my science test... must've asked like 5 different people about the test, took the test in 3rd, and found out that people weren't lying when they said it was easy. Fourth and fifth I spent working on my Computer Engineering Course, FINALLY managed to get the stupid printer networked... that got us stumped for like an entire period yesterday.    Ah... I fear for my safety... TA interview tomorrow ... I'll try to get it postponed... ^^;;   After school, we had Anime Society, and as a Valentine special, we watched Karekano... I liked it, even though I usually hate storylines fully based on romance. It was definitely better than Boys Be, though one member of Anime Society disagrees...meh, hope we get back to Gundam Seed, Wolf's Rain, and Scryed. Now, I'm back home and ready to work some more... che sera sera... I won't worry too much bout my TA interview right now...^^;;   ~Chronos
