Today I was out of the house by 10:30...that sounds quite late, but I'm a guy who rarely goes to bed before 3 because I do most of my writing after 10pm.  But I was up grading papers and reading scripts come 11, and now, at 5pm, I've gotten all of my grading caught up, my script is in the hands it needs to be in, and I'm progressing readily on the job search.    So I can play with the drums for an hour tonight!  Job search stuffs...I need to work in the field, or something closely related.  It's not imperative that I live in LA and work in development...I don't want to do that, I hate LA and I am bothered by the pretention that is Hollywood filmmaking.  I'll need to dea with it at some point, but my hope is to do that as a writer rather than as an arm of the machine.  Anyway, that's why I'm looking at teaching jobs...get into academia, teach writing, and work on projects on the outside during the school year, and use my summers to film or pitch or do what I must do to be successful.  I love teaching, and it's what I want to do.  But I want to be a successful craftsman as well.  So any job in the field will do...whether it be as a PA on a film set, working as a reader in Hollywood, teaching writing, working in publishing, working in journalism, or even working with live theatre.  It's time to get the resume as broad as possible with festival-quality projects (screenplays and shot plays), and maybe progress to working on short fiction or stage plays.    Interesting thing about me...I have more energy when I have more to do.  I love to be busy.  I value my time so much more when I have things to do.  When I've got one thing on my pallate, I play grabass until it comes.  When I've got eight things, I have to schedule in my writing, and my writing becomes much better at that point.
