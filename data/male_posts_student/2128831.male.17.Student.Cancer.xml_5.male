I sent him his package today it will be there Wednesday!  Damn, $13.73 cents later! You owe me, boo! Lol, it will all be better when I get his package!  I know I can’t wait! So, Sam and I are having an argument that I shouldn’t eat my free range organic turkey for Thanksgiving. We got into this argument that Tatina, the turkey was murdered by a senile roster accidentally when Farmer Hasiwitz left an axe on top of Tatina’s pen.  So, now   One boy that I did truly love broke my heart Not soon after we did start Another boy spread poisons and lies About me and him and how we are And now united those two become  And then soon take it too far To spite me and piss me off  Together they two decide to call They dial my number With expert care for they do know  I will be there, I answer the phone  The number blinking unknown The first is there and pleasantries flow And not soon after the other stupid hoe Opens his mouth and the giggling starts I understand now what this is about The first speaks and tells me Of the thong that just fell to his feet And of the other mouth that went to his meat Where this is going and why I am not sure They start telling me of sex and of lust Inside I scream “What the f---?” They share their whore-like views Of love and the word’s abuse  They slander love and all that it is Telling me that love  Forever for me  will seize to exist And, how I should crawl and say “Misunderstand and unwanted” I tell them of their seedy misdeeds That love is for the honest The true ones that really do care And that it for them will never be there They shoot back between moans and groans  That I mistaken and therefore alone I shoot back  that I am “Happy and quite pleased” That I am not the one committing misdeeds With whom I might have And what real love will come to be They cut me off with details Of the first’s now arching cumshot At this point I have had enough I hang up the phone, disgusted and sick By their twisted view of what love is They never will see That love is a blessing, not a type of abuse And those if you with to have it  You will wait and see that it isn’t about sex  That it is of caring for the one that is there And embracing forever of what we have with no cares      Dear angel, my salvation Save me from this wretch That I have found myself in You are the one who can save me In your embrace, I am not drowning In the waves that are crashing Engulfed in a black hole Destroying my mind and my soul  I will always find love in you I am stuck, will you come and save me? Why are you the one so gentle? Why are you  the one so pure? You are the angel that loves Never been in this place before  You can always lift me higher And can restore my faith in life Almost giving up on love With your kiss you save me I now believe in what love is  I will always find love in you I am stuck, will you come and save me? Why are you the one so gentle? Why are you  the one so pure? You are the angel that loves Never been in this place before You can save me  I never believed in anything Not even myself, it was nothing I will always find love in you I am stuck, will you come and save me? Why are you the one so gentle? Why are you  the one so pure? You are the angel that loves Never been in this place before  Come my heaven and fill my room For I never knew what love is Until tonight, when you came And, saved me from what I was before Never been loved by an angel Never by anything so pure Come and join me tonight An show the world What love is and how you are  I never have been love by an angel Never anything so pure Never loved by an angel Till tonight when You heaven filled my room Until tonight when Your heaven filled my room    Don’t be afraid, this won’t hurt Have some faith this is real Together all this feelings we can sort We together  can feel If you just believe in me If you ever just wish to understand If you wish to stay   And, to let your thoughts run free If you just believe in me Take my hand  Walk together with me Take my hand  Let me guide you to a special land Take my hand Together in this world we can be   Take my hand  Don’t let it slip like grains of sand Take my hand Don’t worry at all, this is fine Have some passion, this is real Together we’ll never draw the line We together can feel If you just believe in me If you ever just wish to understand  If you wish to stay And, to let your thoughts run free If you just believe in me Take my hand  Walk together with me Take my hand  Let me guide you to a special land Take my hand Together in this world we can be   Take my hand  Don’t let it slip like grains of sand Just take my hand And believe in what is  there… In you and in me…
