I think I'm gonna trim my nose hairs then go for a jog. I must see Napoleon Dynamite. A friend sent me the dance scene and I cried I laughed so hard. I'm doing it for the next dance show hands down.  I'm in  a better mood today. Dunno what was wrong with me last night. Maybe it'll kick back in tonight and I'll figure it out.  I'm watching Newlyweds season 2 right now. Jessica my oh my. How can something so hot be so stupid? Ok yeah easily I know I know.  I've decided I don't need a girlfriend I just need to get laid. I've got alot of pent uo sexual frustration. Need to let off some steam. Not saying I you know...would be rough or something like that...wow am I sounding like a creep here. CHANGE OF SUBJECT!!  I started listening to some of Johnny Cash's old stuff. Quality shit. Anyone who thinks they know everything about him because they've heard "hurt", you don't know shit. I'm getting tired of all these little 15 and 16 year old girls saying they love him and bands like  Zepplin and shit like that cause they're trying to be trendy. I went to Market Mall yesterday. UGH. So many wannabe trendy crap ass stores. All you see is what Cosmo says is cool these days. Even that "Play" is shit. trying to pretend they're indy but the second you step in the first album I saw was Jojo. I'm not saying I'm some indy freak. Just saying mainstream and indy are two completely different worlds and it's lame that they're trying to mesh them. Why can't people just be themselfs and stop having to be told what's cool or not. Gah lame.  Hey I bought Godsend yesterday. About to watch it. Looks scary as shit. Send in the clones oui?
