It's all a matter of just how far you'd go for what you want, I think. I'd say it has more of a sordid side than anything else but there's still the people who try to hang on to their morality and such. Anyway, I wouldn't believe everything I read or see. They're all hazes and cut-ups and people all seem to look alike. I'll believe it when it's right in front of my eyes and even then, I'll doubt it. Why? Because truth is not everything as we perceive it. Truth is relative and a matter of opinion. It all depends on you.
