Well those of you may refer to the photo in my previous post for my response to that.        LiveJournal sucks. It's just got a gay form to type your posts in, and all the templates are lame. It's alsounable to be fully customized unless, of course, you're a paid-for member, haha.     All in all, I'm happy with my decision to change to blogger, and all of you who aren't can, to quote Maria Heinz Kerry...     Shove it.
