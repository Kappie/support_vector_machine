At first I was on dining room, but then Sam the manager said that I could get trained pouring soups. It wasn't too bad, but when it got slow it felt like the day would go on forever.  I went over to my mom's place for dinner - chicken, steak, and rice - and afterwards I jumped on the trampoline. Me and my sister were playing with this huge ball and I kicked it and it hit her arm and it must have snapped it back in a weird direction because she started crying because it hurt really bad. At first, I thought that she broke it, but she seems to be doing much better now.   Well I'm working from 2:30-10:00... so at least I'll get to sleep in. I can't wait until Tuesday - I'm going down to the Art Museum in Philadelphia because John Kerry is coming by for a rally. It's one of his last stops before he flys up to Boston to accept the nomination in Boston on Thursday. I'll make sure that I take a lot of pictures and post the best ones here. I already have a picture of me and Teresa Heinz-Kerry at a John Kerry rally at the Philadelphia Convention Center. It would be awesome to get a picture with Kerry, butI have a feeling that this event is going to be huge with a lot of people and media, so I doubt that I'll get the chance.  Well, I'm tired as could be so I think I'll hit the hay now. Comedy Central is running reruns of the Chappelle Show - which is simply the funniest show on television - so maybe I'll check that out until I fall asleep. I crack up everytime I watch the famous "Rick James" sketch, but so many people quote it all the time that it's not funny. New rule - if you're not Dave Chappelle, you can't impersonate Rick James.
