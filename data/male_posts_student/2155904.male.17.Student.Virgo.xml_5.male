Accompanying the two studs was their hottie with a body Karla Kind as well as the best buds Macaroon, Tyronius, Amed, and his new gal pal Dolores Dandelion.  The two felt the movie was a poignant tale and were pleased by it.  Upon completion, the group went back to Tyke's pad for some dancing action which involved Tyke getting into a really really hot outfit that showed off his insanely masculine physique.  It is insanely wickedly and awesomely muscular.  No joke.  Really, no joke.  Well, I guess if you compare his body to an ant.  Actually ants are really strong aren't they?  Can't they lift like 30 times their body weight?  Or is it 10?  Or 3?  Hmmm...what is it?  So I guess if you compare his physique to a 2 year old girl then he is the most muscular person ever seen.  But then the group did more stuff not worthy of mention.  Except they played a game that rhymes with Hunty Feconds.  It was unsuccessful but Karla was not so kind with her playing even though at one time it is apparent that she did comply with the rules but there is no way to know.  Nonetheless, it is a fun game.  It may be labeled as perverse and that is probably fitting but it is still fun and if you don't believe so then you are either gay or a girl that isn't real open.  Then everyone left and Tyke cleaned up and had yet another night with build up but no completion ;).
