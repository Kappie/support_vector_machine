Now, I saw it on Sunday, and boy, what a movie it was. Is that kind of movie that lift your spirit and makes you feel good and makes you believe in love. And believe me, it does makes you feel great.  ... There are a lot of movies I was planning to see this holiday, but now I'm single again and already I've missed two. So as I see, I'll have to find a friend/date to go and see them.  Is it too soon to start dating again? How much time should I give myself then? Now there are this guys, one seems like a nice bloke and a possible great friend. This other guy is bf material, but I don't want to be in a relationship at the moment, well, I think so. And this other guy could be both, a friend or a bf. Still, am I ready to go full head on this?
