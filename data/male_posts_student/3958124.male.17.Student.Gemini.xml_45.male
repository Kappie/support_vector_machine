Ki! Yeh so Ge! (Ge or Ghe) Yeh so weh keh! Whattha Fah? Yeh so weh keh! Shuttha Fahuh! (Fahuh has been heard "Fahup," but this is the word of legends...)  Ok. Remember that controversial post I made about people putting personal stuff in their AIM Profile (WAY back in March - on the 12th)? Well, I was partially right. This chick has split with Mikey, and John is her new "boo". Apparently, 4eva means until last week. People have become so hurried to get to the next text message from a friend, the next IM, the next e-mail, the next text sex, what have you, that they can't even spell out "forever." Seven simple letters, signifying an indefinite amount of time, supposedly unmeasurable - nay - incomprehensible to human mental capacities. So, I submit that when a member of an intimate relationship can't even move their fingers a total of 1.5 extra inches for their partner, something is seriously fubar. LADIES: I WILL MOVE 2 MAYBE EVEN 3 INCHES FOR YOU. YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S AT.  Tonight was Passover. Travis: You are so gefilte, it's meshuga! Oyvay! Less passing, sooner.
