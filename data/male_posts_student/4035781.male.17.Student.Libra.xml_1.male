I slept in till around 10-11. From there I got up and my parents informed me of the things I am responsible for whilst they leave for two days. It's nice to have some away time from them... though even when their home I still get lonely. From there I got to hang out with Adam and Josh. Very cool, learnt some some weapons technique for flying kama's and regular kama's. A kama is an miniture scythe with an handle about eight inches long and a blade about six or seven inches long. A flying kama is a kama with an leather thong on the handle to spin it around with. I learnt a technique for spinning two weapons at once, quite challenging at first but rewarding once you get the hang of it. We also talked about a fellow who is a fourth degree blackbelt in karate and trained in many other disciplines who does weapons training with an elite team of his own in Edmonton. He's on team canada and apparantly trains hard in all sorts of karate weapons such as thebo, sai's, nunchucku, kama, tonfa, and swords. They even have big brawls wearing super-protective armor apparantly - quite dangerous by the sounds of it. Sounds like something I'd be interested in. Though I'd have to get my blackbelt first and hope he'd recruit me for training... that's a bit down the road.   Besides that I got completley owned in foosball, I held my own better in air hockey though. Josh has a really awesome basement. Cool guys as well, will definatly hang out with them again. Yeah, I've still yet to manage the art of the "kick up" a fancy move to get up off the floor when your on your back. It looks quite impressive when pulled off correctly. Quite stupid if not pulled off though.  Karate class was excellent, had a large class, maybe ten people. My gei was really snappy today, the teacher took notice :) good stuff. Did lots of kata, and some bonkai. Sensei also says Karen is coming along nicely, there has been vast improvement since she started. She got to flip people her size today rather than myself.   So, all in all it was a good day. Other than the fact a mosquito flew directly into my right eye as I was biking full speed down a hill. I had to escort Karen home since I gave her my old bike and her mom didn't want her going home alone late at night. Apparantly 9:30 is late... so I got home at like 11, and I swallowed another mosquito as well. Now I sit here an hour later pleasantly tired and looking forward to practicing my bo kata tommorow. Hopefully I will get to hang out tommorow as well.  D
