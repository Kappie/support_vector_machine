I've decided today that Idislike Jake. I really do. Do you not know who Jake is? Jake is Katie (R)'s little make-believe boyfriend. You know...   "Katie and me are going out"  "Jake and me are going out"   Blah. Get a life. Katie, come on, Jake is like, what, eight? Ok, maybe eight-and-a-half. You can do better than that. You can do better than someone who types stuff like:   -Quote:   Yesturday was my 13th birth day.YA! we went to c i,robot at 3:00 came back went swimming and played 1 of the best games in the world Halo for Xbox. I robot was a very cool/funny movie. Ecpesially the part when he was talkin to this guy and all of a sudden he went cough cough.....sry i am alergic to BullShit.Lol it cracked me up.I really liked it and i hope ever1 else did.I loved gettin all my gifts and the very funny i-o-u from katie.(lol).I had a godd b-day,and i hope every1 else had fun. well... ill try n update my posts after i get back from vacatinon. bye   -End Quote   Boo! Nobody likes j00r lack of grammar. Although now that I said that, I know 1800 people are going to find every grammar mistake I've ever made and prosecute me. Peoples are dumb. Especially someone who writes a comment telling me my blog is dumb, and then creates their own blog (Yes, I am talking about Jake. His blog is at j-loaf-blogspot.com). Thus, I dedicate today's title to Katie. Katie used to be very mature for her age. Now she hangs around with seventh graders (No offense to... you know what? Fuck it. Seventh graders are losers). I love you Katie :D!   It's a good thing she's my best friend or I'd never talk to her again. I don't know if that last sentence made sense, but I seriously don't care. Oh well. If you want to read Katie's blog or one of my other good friend's blogs, scroll down to the footer at the bottom. Neat, eh? I'm going to try to get all if my friends on blogspot to put something like that as their footer. We'll be like a webring without a name. We're just that cool.   That footer is the only exciting thing that I think happened today. I tried to hang a street sign with tape, but eh, didn't work. I should write that one down. I might update later. Night for now.    I bet you Jake is going to dedicate a whole post to like bashing me. He's going to be like 'oh em jee, he uses .scene wtf is that. I'm too kewl.     .Characters    Jake  - Katie's sorta boyfriend. He's a lot younger than her. I think he's kinda lame. I could just be jealous; who knows.   Katie - Jake's sorta girlfriend; one of my best friends in FL. We were once inseperable.    .Music   Yellowcard - Sure Shot  Story of the year - Till the day I die
