I want to have tattoos all over just like him...and play guitar like him too. He is the lead guitarist for  urlLink Fozzy , and former guitarist for the band  urlLink Stuck Mojo . I have been very obsessed with  urlLink Fozzy  in the past couple days more than anything. I want to see one of their concerts so bad. I want their merchandise, I want their  CD  that I dont have...anyways, here is Rich Ward!   urlLink
