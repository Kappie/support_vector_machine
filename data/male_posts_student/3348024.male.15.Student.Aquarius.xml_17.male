The first post will have four in it because I posted these days ago on the other site, but every subsequent day will have it's own post.  5/10/04  My path to world domination is clear and now I will travel the road starting, of course, with giving molemonkey a purple bananna.  Today after school I purchased eight banannas of which seven remain.  I had to eat one on the way home.  The bananna of molemonkey's doom has been painted, but having run out of purple paint, I filled the rest in with red.  He'll never notice.  Tomorrow at 10:11 I will be released from my second hour and will immediately meet up with General Tim.  General Tim and I will then proceed to the cafeteria where we will find molemonkey telling lame jokes and laughing like an old man.  We will set the purple bananna in front of him and laugh at him old man style.    5/11/04  FUUUCK... Stupid POS me, I already wrote this once, but I forgot to save it before I exited so here goes...  Today, as planned, I brought the purple bananna to school.  Also as planned, I met up with General Frye after second hour and we began our journey to the cafetorium, army crawling through the computer lab on the way.  I showed General Tim the bananna and after making sure the coast was clear, I rolled into the cafeteria and began walking over to the table which was occupied by Molemonkey and his smelly friends.  I said, "Molemonkey, you're my best friend in the whole wide world and I just want to give you this."  I then placed the bananna on the table in front of him in a firm, but not aggressive manner.  "PSHdfFUCKDDFKJLUBRAD," he replied, and naturally, hearing my name, I was interested, so I asked "What's that?"  He picked up the bananna and threw it at me striking me in the face.  Upon contact, the bananna broke slightly and some of the bananna slushie sexually violated my nose.  Tim and I laughed like old men off their rockers, mocking Molemonkeys old man laugh.  We then took the bananna over to Agent Cody Banks (our secret friend) and presented it in the same fashion to him.  As we were leaving the bananna struck General Frye in the back of the head.  We immediately fell to the ground laughing like old men off their rockers.  Mr. Birkholtz then told us to go back to our seats.  We went back to the table and sat down.  With the bananna still in our possession we felt we needed to do something with it.  We squeezed the contents of the bananna peel onto a piece of bread and put another piece of bread on top of it effectively creating a banana slushie sandwich.  Our initial plan was to throw the sandwich at Matt Moore in the bathroom during halftime of design.  That plan quickly went down the shitter so I just threw the sandwich at General Tim later on during design.     Oh yeah...  Sara thinks I called her a whore.  Damn you Will...      5/12/04  Well, today was interesting.           The answer is no.  I will not expand upon that           5/13/04  Another interesting day.  I think I'll tell you folk though, cause you're just cool like that.  So it started off normal (fuck that's the lamest thing i've ever written, doesn't that just sound like the beginning of a tale where the hero of the story is riding his donkey to school and is suddenly thrown off and fucked in the ass by the donkey... oh, well, what can ya do?)  Well, before I was rudely interupted by myself, I was saying, it started off as a normal day, I went to the cafeteria in the morning to talk to the ever conceited, but always hilarious Nate.  I was talkin for a while when a sudden urge to throw a milk at him struck, lucky for me I didn't have a milk, that bitch woulda been dead.  That's the whole fucking morning for you.  I hope you're happy.  Oh, and I had to type out like 3 fuckin memos, two business letters, a report, and 2 tables in keyboardin.  Blow me, Mr. Heath.  Lunch was good fun again.  Like always, we annoyed the shit out of Molemonkey aka Check Mate.(funny story about that.  One of his teeth looks like a rook from a chess set.)  During lunch Desiree aka nipple tooth said Jimmy was hot.  Of course we knew she meant he was physically appealing, but being the jackasses that we are, we took it literally and pursued the truth.  Is Jimmy running a fever?  Luckily for Jimmy, we came across General Frye's secret friend, Nolan, and he took the responsibility of checking Jimmy's body temp.  We found out that nipple tooth was right, Jimmy did indeed have a fever.  Being the good friends that we are we told Mr. White that Jimmy was running a fever and he being the crazy old man that he is told us to shut up and get to work.  We decided to take matters into our own hands, which is why, we will be bringing a wet wash cloth and an icebag to help Jimmy get rid of his fever.  And.... Nate and I got served today in gym.  First, we lost to Lauren and Courtney on account of Nate being whipped by every hot girl he knows and partially because of some sketchy score keeping.  Then Lisa and Christina (I think that's her name) beat us cause we suck.  So... yeah.... We got served up something major.              5/14/04  Today was very successful.  I went to Al's with Soda this morning and bought a dozen banannas.  General Tim found someone to supply the Green and the White and I have the Fire so next Friday is fixin to be good.  I scored five goals when we played soccer while everybody was staring at my perfect ass.  Jesus scored two goals(I had to share to glory before i crucified him)  I went completely secret agent on Spitz.  He never saw it coming.  I had a bananna hidden in the front pocket of my shirt and as I went under the desk to get the pencil I "accidentially" dropped on the floor I swiftly ducked out of view and sat down there for five minutes while I ate my bananna.  I ate six banannas today and some whore faced kid named travis told me I could die if I ate too many.  Some shit about a calcium OD. General Tim and I definitely army crawled throught the computer lab after lunch and no one saw us.  Those bitches are still looking for the person that stole the kleenex box last week.  Of course we made fun of Molemonkey/Check Mate/Old Man (all one person).  "Bitch, I'll grab your ass," he threatened.  I being scared by the prospect of Molemonkey grabbing my ass, sat down and did the "Chuckle, Chuckle, Chuckle, Giggle, Giggle, Giggle, Guffaw Guffaw, Guffaw" old man laugh.  Then this Josh kid said he was going to beat the shit out of us.(General Tim and Me)  I then proceeded to the checkout(lunchline) where they questioned me about my bag of banannas and the bananna in my front pocet, to which I answered "Buyer Beware," and whipped out my proof of purchase(from al's) all in one swift motion and continued "I have already exchanged three notes for theese banannas and the cashier was the one that likes Led Zeppelin,(I think) so she's like, "Ohh, brad, I'm so sorry," to which I answered "Oh, but are you really?"  I then walked away giving her no time to reply.  I also saw an interesting fight as I entered the cafeteria.  I saw this kid stand up and hit another kid in the face and dump the kid's tray on him, then he just sat back down like nothing happened.  The funny thing is the kid just took it.  He picked his burger, milk, and fries up off the floor and sat down and ate.  I'm a failiure to all of mankind.  Well, actually, Nolan's the failiure.  He didn't bring a bib, ice pack, or wash cloth for Jimmy, all items which he claimed the responsibility of bringing.  Jimmy's still got a fever.  I think we might have to egg Nolan's face while he's sleeping.  It's ok Nolan, I think we can still be secret friends... dun dun dun
