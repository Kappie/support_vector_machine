My time on stage is too scattered.  I don't have long blocks of time offstage.  The good thing is I only have to wear tights for two scenes.  They're not comfy. On a totally different note, I highly encourage you to read  Ishmael  by Daniel Quinn.  I cannot stress enough how important I think it is that everyone read this book.  I'm working on the sequel (parallel novel) and it's not bad, but the first is just overwhelming, and totally defies description.  Read it, then you'll know why.  That'll also explain what the title of this post means.  Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?
