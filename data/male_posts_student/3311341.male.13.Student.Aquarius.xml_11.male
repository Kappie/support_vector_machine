Every different place I see, people are entirely different in their beliefs, yet share similar personality characteristics.   Once again, it seemed like our Youth Pastor was talking directly to me. Kind of... I know that there's a lot of other people just like me in the youth group, but the message he delivered tonight applied directly to what I've been experiencing.  It was about Sampson, and how he played around sin, just like dancing around a campfire. If you dance too long, then you might get burnt. Which is what I've been doing. I haven't gotten burnt yet, but I'm still arrogant to the paths I'm using. You might say "Well, if you're talking about it now, then how come you say that?". I say it because I get caught up in other things that are unGodly and forget that I've told myself to be a better "christian". I don't think I'm really following through with what it is to be a christian. Right now, I need help. Pray for me, please.   Gar, sometimes I read over my own blog wondering who's it is, and I notice how badly it's written. "mechanical machine"(alliteration-I hate alliterations, it's retarded) "another sea of christians"(that's not what I meant. I meant the concept of belief). I hate this service...
