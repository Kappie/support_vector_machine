Since that momentous day, I've been mentally rehearsing all my movements, refining them in my minds eye, so that when it comes to the crunch, my action will remain efficient; a deft swinging motion that divides between bark and wood. A crash course in wood chopping would rattle through the absolute necessities required of an axe-wielding woodman. Apart from the obvious advantage of owning a sharp axe; there is a host of individual points of technique that will compensate if you lack a precision axe head.     Be on the attack. Growl like a cornered wolf. Charge into the wood with a dynamic thrust, letting out a blood curdling war-cry. Intimidate the wood into submission, making it clear that you'll be at it with your bare teeth if the axe head flies into the lake. Keep hitting the same spot until you have a breakthrough. Don't smile. Keep it simple. Unleash the power.     It's all in the stance. Maintain a 'frog-like' bounce, keeping flexible at the joints. The body shape is similar to the 'sissi-paska' position adopted in the Finnish Army. So, you're only allowed to feel tense for the fear of bears and the rising tide. Loosen up Woodcutter's Son.
