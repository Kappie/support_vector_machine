Well, it WAS scary, but it was soooo slasherish and had all the crappy things in it.  I figure that black people (or Iroquois!) must have come up with slashers.  They make white people into the dumbest things alive.  At one point, I stopped even trying to feel fear because this girl was so fucking dumb.  Whatever, she gets cool points because she hot wired a car.
