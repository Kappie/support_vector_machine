I hope I get better for Saturday so I could go to Chris' house for Josh's Birthday! *Cough* Omg Charmed is on tonight! *sneeze* It should be a good ep, It's called Used Karma (The silly aussie peoples living in the tv's called it Flames of Desire for some reason)... *Cough Cough* I'm not at school! :P  Yeah, as you can see, I started up a blog today, and I like it, so I'll try to post everyday, and hopefully some of my friends will check it out! :D
