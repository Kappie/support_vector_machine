Yesterday I hung out with Paul, Heaton and Ricky. We played home run derby all day. Paul and I hit it over the fence! Woo! I hit it over twice, he did it 3 times, then Paul pitched it to me and I hit the ball only holding the bat with one arm, and it was close to a homerun, it hit the fence! I should hit with one hand for now on. Then we went to the carnival in the day and Ricky and I wore the Stan (South Park) mask and everyone was laughing, except the babies, they were crying. Ricky and also danced on the dance floor with it on. Then we went to Ricky's where I was immitating James in order to piss of Heaton to the point where he started throwing Paul across the room just to get to me. He did Paul more damage than he did to me, in fact he did NO DAMAGE to me. (= Lucky Thomas. We all played Halo with Xbox Live and we all sucked ass. Well we won one game but that's it, all those people are GAME FREAKS! Then at night, Ricky, Paul and I went to the carnival. When Paul and I saw this dumb girl that used to be on our bus, and if you have been a GOO BLOGGER READER for a time now, you'll know Amanda Hacket. When she passed by with her friend, I screamed "AMANDA HACKET!!!" in the "Buddy Wacket Chris Farley voice." It was so great, she turned around and stared at nothing like a stoned retard even though I didn't see her turn around, Paul did, if I turned around she would have known it was me. Maybe she thought it was Paul...oh well. We saw some girls including Erin and Courtney (Did I spell that right?)...haha funny I just wrote write instead of right in the Did I spell that right? thingy. But I fixed it, silly me. Oh, anyways, I spent most my time spying on Ricky and Erin who were smoochin in the woods. Then they found me under the truck and Erin screamed, "THOMAS I HATE YOU!"...god it was hilarious. Then I snuck back and found them again! I showed them Erin's frog Paul and I had decapitated the head from pulling and tugging. Courtney and I had asked the dude at the shooting range if he could post the frog on the line so we could shoot it. He said no obviously, dam gypsies. They're so damn good at taking your money, but that doesn't work with me, I scream out in a funny voice, I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY! and that's all there is too it. Then you wave your arm at them meaning like FUCK OFF and you go ARRRFF. Ok, so anyways, Sorry Erin, your frog will forever be remembered in our hearts and butts. Ok, then finally Courtney, Paul and I went to find them and they werent there so Erin called Courtney and that's how we found them. Then they kissed again in the public for one last great kiss but short, tehe. Ok, so we all said our goodbyes and went our different ways...no that sounds too depressing, we all went home. On our walk home (Ricky, Paul and I) took all the stuffing out of the frog. Then I was going to sleep at Ricky's but my dad wouldn't let me. OK, next day, today...I did nothing because I cancelled all my plans for Angelica but in the end we couldn't even hang out)= so I'm seeing her tomorrow. I love you Angelica, ya we're going out now....ULTRA (=!!! And does anyone realize my proper English? Ya that's from listening to my grandma. She taught me the someone, someone and I thing. And one more thing, when school starts, I'll be updating this foo every day. Hey what's Foo Fighters mean? Like Fool Fighters??? I just thought of that, oh well the world may never know. OK BYE.
