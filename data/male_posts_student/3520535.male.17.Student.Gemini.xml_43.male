The other day I was walking out of the new Gloucester Library and I smelled something slightly salty, like seafood, but very faint (maybe it was from the Blue Fin) and there was a warm breeze and I could see the wooden pillars that used to be there... and I was back in North Carolina, back at our cottage in Nag's Head, on the beach, coming back, salty hair... walking downstairs to the open air shower under the cottage. You know, I miss it. I hate heat. But these are the things that make us who we are. I was given a box of salt water taffy by my grandmother and it made her think of New Jersey, I thought of North Carolina... these memories are what gives us strength when we are alone, why we do things. No one lives in the moment, reflect, see what we've done, where we've been, what there is left to do.
