But the reason why there's no newspaper gave me a good idea for a column.  Ah, the conundrum of it all.  Anyway, the reason there's no paper is because it's "flyout week," when the 2Ls go to callback interviews around the country for their law firm jobs for the summer.  By "around the country" I mean New York and DC.  Because those are the only places anyone gets jobs.
