And thanks to some enchantments, I have a constant effect recover health, fatigue, resist magic 60%, and fortify strength 24 points, I heal faster than most people can hurt me.  Not to mention my long sword that does 5-70. But I have the house to myself this weekend, don't know what I'm gonna do. Probably play Morrowind but you already knew that.  In closing: It is strangely satisfying to mass-slaughter an entire village... once you  can  mass-slaughter and entire village.
