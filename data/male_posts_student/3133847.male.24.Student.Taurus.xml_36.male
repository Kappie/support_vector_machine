Some of them havegone in for more education in foreign countries.  Nikhil Patil went to Australia to pursue his MS. Vipin Ajmera is liikong after his family business. Nagu left a plum job at Mahindra to be with his parents and start a business there. Deepesh Jain is in Mumbai, as is Prateek Shah and Vishal Shah.  Ajay Kulkarni is at Caritor, and he plans to write a book about his engineering days. Mahibub is at MobiApps Bangalore. Suyog Upadhaye is at Wipro. Raghu is at MBT. Suyog Kulkarni is at Wipro. Sandeep Patki is switching jobs. Panku is a whiz in microsoft technologies now. Nitin is in a shifting of base, from Mumbai to Pune.  Nivesh is in Bangalore, Mayank is at  Geometrix Noida, Sachin Jain is in Bharti TElecom, Tarun is in his dad's Business.....  Pallavi is in Mumbai, Pradnya is doing a CCNA course, Sapana is trying out for the armed forces. .. The list goes on.  All this makes me think... That in all the hustle bustle of our work and study, I hope we still stay in touch. Because memories of WIT are an integral part of who we are today.  Well, Abhishek Malu is with me here at SIIB.   --  http://adityasanyal.blogspot.com
