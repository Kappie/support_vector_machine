My econs teacher mocked honkies to their faces in the lecture and the episode gave me a good laugh. And in the evening, a girl fainted and drama practice was cancelled because of that. But the highlight of my day was definitely after school.  I went back to Fairfield to get tickets to "The silly little girl and the wise old tree". Walked towards Miss Luah's class and found her not there. That's not the point. I turned about to go back towards Joe in the canteen and I saw Zel on the corridor. I wasn't as scared as the last time, but I was still very worried. You know the way many thought's zip through your mind when you're shocked. I was calmer, but still worried that she'd give me the "what the hell are you doing here?" look.  She saw me too. She smiled. Everything was alright just then. If I had to trade this whole week for those four seconds, I would. She smiled at me! Things are looking up. She actually talks to me civilly now. I'm so so so happy. We sat at the same table with Joe. She laughed and smiled and was happy. I was happy. I miss the way she tries to tell her story whilst she laughs. I miss the way she laughs, the way she smiles. I am thankful that things are picking up slowly. She hasn't fully warmed up to me yet, but I was a dumbass in my decision and I suppose I deserve it.  Did exercise in school. Realised that I can't do pull-ups any more. I don't understand why. So I ran about 9 rounds and did a few push ups instead. I watched the play today. It was pointless, but it was good to see how my juniors there are doing. Gave practical criticism to the teachers and helped them close shop at the end if it all. It's technically and setting-wise impressive, but I think it's more of a literature type play. Will watch it again on Friday.  I say again; if I could trade my week just to see her smile again, I would. It's that important to me.
