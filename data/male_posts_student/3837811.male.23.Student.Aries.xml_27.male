As i was waiting for the delivery van, i heard a sound of a truck from my room, so i tot it might be the delivery van, but i saw tis red monster downstairs....     The siren wasnt on, but that didnt stop me from sticking my head out of my kitchen window to make sure the fire is not from above/below my flat... And in fact, there wasnt any fire, but the fire truck and the ambulance came.. hmmz.. strange  The delivery man explained to me how to use the DVD recorder and stuffs, but after trying out, i discovered that i couldnt watch Teletext on the TV, so i called up the salesperson and asked, but then.. hmmz... Lets just say i figured it out myself, and its neither wat the delivery man nor the salesperson explained. Oh well... Was a bit fed-up for a while...Anyway the DVD recorder is way cool then VCR, tried some recording jus now, the pic and sound qualities are superb! The delivery man said that he dun do IT stuffs, so he dun install the printers, ok nvm, i set it up myself, and to my surprise the printer did not provide the USB cable, i was like WTF!! i checked the list of tings tat i should have, and true enough, no cables included........ Haiz, going to get it tomolo... Sianzzz   Current Mood: Sian Current Music: St Etienne - Sound Of Water
