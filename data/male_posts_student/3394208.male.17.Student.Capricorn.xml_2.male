I guess now, cause I'm not walking but running... running towards something or away from something... the rain hasn't hit here yet, or has it ceased... I've never been so alone... and I've never been so alive... sunny days... burning... something's burning within me might it be my hate again?  or something else is fueling this burn... damnit...  running, such freedom... no one stopping me... no one in front of me... running wherever i want to... this fire burning, happiness... such happiness... hardly ever thinking of the cold dark pit i was in anymore... i'm not in it anymore, it's not gloomy anymore, it's just so sunny... What?!?
