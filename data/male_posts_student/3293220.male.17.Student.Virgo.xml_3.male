It time is half past eleven, and I'm just about to start to work. For some obscure (to me, that is) reason, I've decided to not work during usual hours, and instead make up for it during the night. More importantly, this means sticking to a rigid schedule of seven and a half hours of sleep per night, last being an exception. 
 All in all, it's been another normal day. Not surprisingly. And now this place is being locked up  so I'll pick up this thread again in the morning...
