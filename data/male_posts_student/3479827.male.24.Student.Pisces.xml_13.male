He's quite the energetic type, so we weren't able to sleep for much longer.  We spent most of the day organising our trip to shanghai including a fruitless trip to the bank who don't offer a foreign exchange on a sunday (it's worth noting that, unlike the uk, shops here open 7 days a week, often until 9 or 10 at night). After more of yuqi's dad's fantastic fried dumplings for lunch, we headed to the station.  We're now on another overnight sleeper service identical to the others. Yuqi and i are on facing middle bunks. Even though the journey is very long, i'm getting used to the train travel now.  On the way so far we passed through a huge storm. Bright lightning and hail the size of golf balls! It was quite scary at one point, because it sounded like the train was under attack. Hailstones that big make quite a noise when they hit the train windows, i'm suprised they withstood it all!  More tomorrow when i can give you first impressions of shanghai.  Interesting china fact #4 - you can forget english table manners when you're here. It's fine to slurp, belch and make other eating noises. You can drink directly from your bowl and spit bones and seeds directly onto the table. Eating in the uk seems ridiculously formal in comparison!
