Two quick responses to my esteemed co-author...first, Chinua hit 30 again, though he is not out of the danger zone with it...but he will be soon.  Second, I heard about this Florida guy (Bob Graham?), but only in passing.  My guy is Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont.  His beliefs are actually a change from the hegemonic shit that moderate Republicans and Democrats spew forth today...that means that he holds no chance of election, but at least he's not a yes man, like John Kerry and John Edwards.
