I'm glad for my sake that I didn't post. Then we have those nuts who go to raisethefist.... Oh Allah, I was only further pissed from that.  So I'm currently needing to stay away from most things that involve race, or else I will simply explode from the anger.    Who knew the internet could cause such anger?
