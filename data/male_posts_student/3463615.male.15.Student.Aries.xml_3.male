I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm horny, and I need to take a leak. Besides, I have nothing better to do. Sleep you say? Well, sleep is for pussies. All a dark, handsome stud like me needs is lots of water and Rocky Road ice cream. A few gallons of testicle-shrinking Mountain DewÂ® will also do. Well, back to the task at hand. I seek to bring this blog forth from the obscure masses and crotch-thrust it forth into the limelight. But to do that we will need discipline. So here are the ground rules. If you are not me, and you post anything obscene about your pee pee on this blog, that's a technical foul. If you have one or more breasts weighing you down, you need to stop reading immediately and go back to cooking and cleaning/having babies. If you resemble either a) Blas Diaz or b) Rebecca T., in any way, you get five, count 'em five, instant technical fouls. The penalty for having a technical foul is painful circumcision. Of course the penalty is waived if you manage to do seventeen cock push-ups. There is more to come. I will keep you updated.
