Only 36% of the population believes Kerry is a “strong leader,” while 55% of Americans have confidence in George Bush’s leadership.    Kerry isn’t racking up points on the issue of national defense either.  Merely 38% of Americans think John Kerry will make our country safer.  54% however, believe Bush is doing what it takes to make America safe.    Even after watching Michael Moore’s sorry excuse for a “documentary.” The general population still trusts Bush over Kerry.  46% of Americans describe the president as an honest man, while only 40% have the same to say of Senator Kerry.    While we’re on the issue of honesty and trust, the same ABC News poll shows that 55% of Americans trust President Bush on the issue of terrorism.  Only 37% would rather have Kerry dealing with terrorists.    Speaking of war, 52% of Americans trust the president to handle the situation in Iraq.  Only 40% of America would trust Senator Kerry with the same responsibility.    Through all the prisoner abuse scandals, the leftist propaganda, the less than awe-inspiring 9/11 Commission report, and the endless drone of the liberal media, President Bush still maintains a razor thin (but now growing) lead over Senator Kerry in the popular vote.  In the electoral vote however, (the number that really matters) Bush is leading Kerry by a small margin.  Even if Kerry can manage to win every state won by Gore in 2000, he still has to pick up several states from Bush’s side.    Maybe if John “Flip-Flop” Kerry would articulate his vision for America, the polls would show him some mercy.  Is he going to do this?  Not likely.
