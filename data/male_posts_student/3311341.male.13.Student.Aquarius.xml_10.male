The high school music program concert was tonight. I didn't  go because I had a headache that hurt only when I moved.    I don't really like this site as an online journal but I guess I'm thankful for  it anyway. I've been wanting one for a while, now. Anyway, for background(addressed  to stalkers) I'm thirteen right now, and I live in New York. Figure the rest out  from my journal.     Nobody complimented me today, which is strange, because I'm so cool... ;P  Actually, I'm just selfish, but yeah. Today was boring and I just realized how bad  it must be for you to sit and read this... Boring, eh? Yep. Get use to it.
