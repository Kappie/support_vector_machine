It's not that I dislike the question in and of itself, it's just that when you are asked that repeated times per day (sometimes by the same person), it gets old. My life is not an open diary in which I prostrate myself before the masses and cry out that I am feeling well. Or feeling sad. Or feeling a bad case of indigestion coming on, which I am right now. (And you didn't even have to ask!)  I don't claim to be a very private person, but I'm tired of telling other people how I'm doing. If they can't figure it out by other signs, that's too bad. Should a person reallysay how they are feeling? Isn't that making it too easy for other people to figure out the rich, complex labryinths of emotion that humans are? Can we really explain what we are feeling at any given point durng the day? And even if we can, does it matter? Won't we feel something different in a few short moments?  Whenever this particular person whom I work with asks me the question, I flash to the scene in American Beauty where the hot girl next door asks the studly and soon-to-be-doomed dad how he's feeling. This is not because the girl is hot or because I feel particularly studly or doomed, but because of the father's response to the question. He is delighted that the question was asked. He bemoaned that no one had asked him the question for quite some time.   Within minutes of the question being posed, he's dead. I'm not sure that it was the writer's intention to insinuate that there is a connection between an exposition of the soul and expulsion of the soul, but that's the connection I always make. If someone else really knew how you were feeling (leaving God of the equation at present), what would be the point to existence? There would beno more mystery to life, and I believe that the mystery is the reason to exist.   Next time that the girl asks me this question, I think I'll just tell her about how I feel some irritable bowel syndrome coming on, and that's it is best if she left the room.
