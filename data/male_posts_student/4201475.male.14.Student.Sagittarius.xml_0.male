P.E is the best subject, no difficult thinking required and i really love that we can throw and kick stuff around and stay on task at the same time. it was the first PE class Molly's taken since he had his little girl. see ya. Tomarse,  Thursday 19/8 Chapter 22: stayin home I was really tired today so i stayed home. I was up all night watching the Olympics and I went and played the computer after that and my dad walked in and said "your up early" yeh it was about 5:00am. so at like 2:00pm i got up and worked for a few hours at the toy shop.  Friday 20/8 Chapter 23: yay the end of the week! Yet another impressive sporting display from super Tomarse in hockey with 4 goals, the rest of the team did a bit of work but i carried them to victory. I rule! stupid Phedra! Hack my ankles! and the rest of the time it was either mucking around in Italian or listening to music in music elective and a bit of work here and there. Lachlan decided to stick to basketball because hes too dangerous in hockey he swings to high and gets sent off all the time. Tom,  Saturday 21/8 chapter 24: Me old lady's b'day Just an average Saturday working at the shop...Yawn and it my mums birthday so i gotta go see all my rellies on her side of the family tonight....Bunch of drunks....a little harsh but they do get through a lot of champaign so they also tend not to notice if a glass or two go missing here and there.....um the dog drank it mum! i completely forgot my mums birthday and i had absolutely nothing to give her. it was the same with my dad. I suck at remembering birthdays.  Sunday 22/8 chapter 25: More Pirated DVD's! Yay we got Man on fire, Garfield and Spider man 2 on Dvd but no cd's this week. I hate those adds at the movies eg: you wouldn't steel a movie, you wouldnt steel a hand bag, you wouldn't steel a T.V then dont download pirated movies ....Piracy is steeling. It's just like sharing movies the only reason they have those adds is because they dont want to loose money! and if my uncle the Church minister pirates dvd's it cant be that bad! so i tend to ignore the adds. In fact i used to have my own Pirating business with my cousin we burnt playstation games, Dvd's, Vcd's and music cd's and we only got caught once and we were able to run away. we made about 300 bucks each.......True story.
