It's almost the end of the week, I have pretty much all of my work done, I have second-lunch French, no chemistry, no myth, folk tale, and science fiction, and my house is clean because today is when the cleaning people come.  Yeah, I'm such a rich spoiled Jewton kid.  Plus, it's just a day away from vacation (and classes tomorrow will be a breeze), I'm acting as the defendant in a cross tonight, and there was a fire today, during which Ian and I ran around looking for our class which Loren and Jason (whom he later told) was quite hilarious.  Apparently the fire was because some kid set it to a trash can on the third floor.  In history, Eric was saying it wasn't that big of a deal, and Ms. Heidlage said, "It's a felony!" and he was like, "I'm not defending it or anything... well I am."  Yesterday, Loren showed me how to use microfilm at the library.  This disrupts the flow but I think it's worth mentioning.  Microfilm is cool.  I looked through the first three years of President Tubman's administration in Liberia, that will take me a while since it was like thiry years altogether.  I'm really impatient about my iPod mini, which won't get here for at least like a month.  I'm usually not this materialistic, I don't know.  For some reason, music has become more important to me in the past year or so.  Here are a couple more quotes from history to finish things:  "Show him the dot, Loren." ---Ms. Heidlage  "It's like cancer, but it tastes really good." ---Eric Messinger, on MSG
