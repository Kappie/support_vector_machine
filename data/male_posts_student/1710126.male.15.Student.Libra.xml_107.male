Painted by myself from 730 onwards...coz everyone couldnt help...bz...then very lonely in the dark......but got alota time for reflection oso.....i realised tt its like meditation..very calming yah? hahaz.   Was feeling terrbible in sch this morning...like very empty lahz. Then during CLE...worse...felt like tearing tt testimonial slip...its like so superficial i didnt do all that juz for testimonial i realised. So what if ppl dunno abt it? AT least i do..and i hate selling myself. Its juz horrible lahz...worst then tortue to write down all those stuff... nvm.  Then later on the painting filled up the space hahaz...made me busy...feel much betta now albeit tired, with a headache etc...  Isnt ironic how sometimes when u r so deeply engraved with an identity u lose ur identity? I m labelled permanently as an art student...cant stand tt sometimes...cant ppl see pass tt...  NITEZ!!...gtg slp soon.....
