So in continuing in the introductory fashion, I will be dutiful in writing numerous posts each week and filling this space with interesting comments concerning sports, politics, and life in general (and probably in that order).  Now that my obligatory opening paragraph is over I will continue with the obligatory 2nd paragraph explaining a little about who I am. Currently, I work for a real estate company in the Twin Cities, and I will be attending graduate school at the  urlLink University of Minnesota  in the   urlLink Human Resource and Industrial Relations  evening program.  For those who do not know what that means...join the crowd. I have been married to my beautiful bride for a little over a year, and we just moved into our new home a few months ago.  So there is the "pertinent" information regarding my life. Besides, by reading through my eventual posts (that will be up practically every other hour as my first paragraph so aptly outlined) you be given an even better picture of who I am and what I am about (to tell the truth, if you are reading this you probably already know me though if you are a complete stranger...all the more power to you).  (On an aside, which I will have often, why do we feel it is mandatory to put complete sentences in parentheses. I have already been guilty of this 3 times and I have written 3 paragraphs (5 including this paragraph and current pretenses). Where did we learn this habit? Was it by instant messaging people and trying to set things off as an aside? is it that previous generations never had asides worth mentioning and all of a sudden we have comedic writers who have wonderful insight that must now be put in an aside to make us realize their additional comments are hilarious? I just put that out here now because my posts will probably be filled with parenthetical asides and I wanted to test the waters.)  Well, I thank you for reading my first post. Any comments on the aside thing would be appreciated. I am positive there will more posts to come (of course...who would say they would put posts up every second and not follow through). Until then....
