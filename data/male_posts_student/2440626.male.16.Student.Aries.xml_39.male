Check mark in the Ridiculously Weird Cravings When You May Possibly Have Mononucleosis Category.  Today the power went off in 7th period--and Yonker lost his voice.  (I know, it was great.)  Miss Iacconi taught all period too.  She is the best.  In Health, Co-Atch says we are speeding through the reproduction chapter like rabbits.  (Yeah, it's nice to make funny jokes.)  Oh yeah, let's hope "Big Mac" doesn't have Mono.  Later.
