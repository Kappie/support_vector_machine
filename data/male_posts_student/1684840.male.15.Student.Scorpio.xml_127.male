Mrs. Checketts arrived a bit earlier than usual and gave the class a minature talk on why she is late (something about exams) and then a small talk about computer misuse and wait for it...  offensive websites  and emails!  It felt like a little of that, or maybe all of it, was aimed at me.  I feel a little bit guilty lol.  Then strangely when I came to log on the computers, it wouldn't work at all.  I had to get my password changed and I got through a little work.  Science was ok, we did something about motors.  French... god I just can't wait to leave, let's just leave it at that.  Becky chose the perfect time to steal my pen off me (I wasn't feeling particuarly well today.  I think I was a bit depressed).  I felt like being alone for a while, which is hard to achieve at school.  Other lessons were just... blah.  Food was ok, had fun smashing the hell out of fruit in the blender.  I feel absolutely whacked.  I have some homework I need to do and I'm boiling hot.  Talk about STRESS!!  Not even music can calm me down I'm so edgy tonight!  I wish there was a way to lie back and forget all the troubles of life and relax for a few minutes so I could sit back up and say "Right, let's get cracking!", but unforunatley... :'(
