I had finally realised that i really cant do anything about my Temper anymore. Its getting worst and worst as the days go on. I mean its really this idea of being a perfectionist over here. My skills are practically going all the way down the River of Nile. Its simply going no way man. My 'NEW' teamates are even better than me. Sincerely speaking, I dont like that one bit at all. Moreover, Im not even recgonised anymore.  Past - WAH lao ehhh whos this guy ah? Ehhh check his id leh. Who is he ah? Ah yoh...No wonder...aHaH what...Ehh...get him into the clan leh..  Present - WTF? Are you sure this is aHaH? Fake one la...Wah? You sure ah? K loh that means Im a pro...WAHAHAHAHAAHA  In the Clan - Used to be very recgonised...Now...No more. Now Opio is the one. I will be frank over here. Im jealous. Fucking Jealous. But trust me. I aint that sort of person who will stoop so low to the extent { fuck your sis? } so as to achieve what I want/deserve. Furthermore, Opio { Siong Chong } is my Best Clan member. I aint gona do those shit to him. In addtion, he deserves this recgonition. He is now better than me.  To add on to the recognition issue, I must say that im not really on ' Husband  Wife ' with my members anymore. Now,NO MORE. Im not included in most conversation lately...never will.  But, even if i suck, it doesnt really make much of a difference...The problem is with my Fucking Temper. I really cant do anything about it. Im angry even as Im writing now. Angry at myself. Angry at my fucked up attitude. Angry at my self for bring such a bitchy pussy. Angry at myself for being so lousy. Now now, Ashley you're such a pussy...Go kiss your mama's Cunt.  Finally, My studies. Its getting incredibly,impressively,unsurprisingly LOUSY. And trust me, Im gonna do it right this time. Im really gona give my chance to do something right for the first time { Guess so. }O yah, Fuck those who doesnt believe this bullshit. I aint gona give a shit to what you think alright. Dipshits.  Even so...I still love CM. I mean this is actually my first clan in some game out there. And, I love all the people in the clan. And i do mean ALL. Funny bunch of Bitches. Great Pals...And its sad to leave all of them to fight without me. Clan Motto ' Till Death Do We Part ' The Big question...am I doing the right thing in quitng, ONLY puting the clan motto into consideration?  And, I really love DoD a lot. I mean Im a war fanatic, and this game is really for me...ITS WW2 based duh...A war which almost destroyed the world, killed quite a couple of millions?   All right. After weighing all the factors on my handy-dandy Weighing scale. I believe that I should quit CM. Isnt it obvious? Im trying to run away from my troubles like a fucking gay. { Im already GAY ^^ }  Yeh Right. I simply feel that running away from this is the best solution. I aint gona argue Why this is the best. But i sure think Ashley is a fucking moronic loser.
