I'm here at Eastern Kentucky University for the Kentucky Governor's Scholars Program, a five week program designed to brainwash the attendees into becoming good citizens, ie. people tolerant of everything but morality. I've been here for 5 days already! Wow! Time sure flies when you're being exposed to a bunch of liberal crud! I'm taking classes in Astronomy, which I sometime like to refer to as Evolution and Liberalism 101, and Creative Writing / Photo Journalism, which has (so far) been OK. I really don't have anything else to say at the moment.  I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.   Psalm 34:4-5 (NIV)
