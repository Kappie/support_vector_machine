       
      Forgive me for my inconsideration, I didn't know that it offended you. Forgive me for my stupidity, though I try to change that. Forgive me for my faults, though I tried not to do that anymore.  Will you give me another chance to redeem myself to you? Will you give me another chance to be a friend to you? Will you give me another chance so that you could forgive me? Will you?  What I have done is wrong and idiotic, I am imperfect, that you could clearly see... Will you forgive and give me another chance to be the friend that you want me to be?
