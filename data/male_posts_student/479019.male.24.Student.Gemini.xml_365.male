I only caught Triple H / Booker T, Hulk Hogan / Vince McMahon, and The Rock / Steve Austin. It was nice since I haven't watched wrestling in a while, but I was bummed that I missed Brock vs. Angle. Oh well... someday I'll rent the DVD of the event.  I also got a decent amount of studying in yesterday as well. The Fine Arts library is a nice place to study. I think I'll do it there more.  Hmm... my mood today? I'm feeling kind of whatever today. I'm realizing that I have a lot of shit to get done in the next few weeks. I especially have to get my housing situation squared away.  Now playing is Culture Club's "Karma Chameleon."  ***
