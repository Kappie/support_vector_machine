It's frustrating. Cracked my knuckles and toes all at once. Still, they agitate me further.  Wherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you. Songs are my life in more ways than one. I find solace in melody and the beach. On the waves and in the breeze. Zephyr.  I listened to Eunos play today. I watched the multitudes gather to hear this prodigy. I'm green. I don't like myself and I feel inadequate. I wish to study music theory and piano. Why am I vexed so easily? I love the boy, yet I feel competitive towards him. That's not right.  God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.
