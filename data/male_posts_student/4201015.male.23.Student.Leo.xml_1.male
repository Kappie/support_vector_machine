Just in case "someone" forgot it, it is my birthday today. Next as it is the ritual here, I had to show my innocent ass to guys(not nude), to the great football players of my batch. And they try their new style of kicking on the 2 footballs i have ;)Then as the ritual continues, all of them had a cool drink. Was lucky enough again, there were only about 40-45 people, as many of them were out of campus and others were busy watching movie on their PCs. So it saved on my ass.                  And the best part of the day, atleast as of now, was the surprise pack from CTS, that our Chennai team of Metal Roses had sent to me, thru Atul. The Wallet was just Fantabulous. And the card was really amazing, Was well chosen, must say... Finally even just about an hour or so after my day begun am happy. Lets see how the rest of the day goes. Hey Ashik, Sakthi and GK, thanks for the calls guys, you really made it a great start. And Sottai, thanks for the Birthday wishes... And thanks to Divya and Vibs too..C U guys... Will give an update on how m y day went...taata   Prakash
