Notice that the number of weapons of mass distruction counter still rests at zero.  Good thing were killing people over non-existant weapons, or wait, could the administration possibly have an ulterior motive? The mind simply boggles. Support our troops, bring them home, and recall that special-ed case we have in the White House.  Thanks to  urlLink This Modern World  for the link.  Read his stuff, he has way more info than I do.
