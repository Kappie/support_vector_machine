Donkey screamed!  hahahaha!  it was so funny!  ok yeah enough bout that.  came home.  finished watchin X-Men 2.  i dont like that movie.  its so sad at the end when that girl dies!  very sad movie.  it also brings back Kari memories.  i remember we were watchin it when i fell for her.  we were just in the theater and she said somethin to me that just made me melt so bad.  i swear that was one of the happiest moments of my life.  i miss that feeling.  where a person just makes you feel so helpless cuz they are so sweet but at the exact same time you feel so secure cuz you trust that person so much.  because you love that person so much.  you what some of the happiest moments now are?  when, just for a moment, i can see a flicker of that love in their eyes.  and then i melt all over again.  its nice to feel it again...even if it's for a second.  and even if its not really there.  its still great.  gosh...THE CANON IN D IS THE BEST SONG EVER!  before i die i WILL play this song!  i promise!  oh goodness it makes me so happy.  its like one of those songs that is both happy and sad at the same time.  its so wonderful.  sigh.  i've got it on repeat.  i can already play some of it.  i must say its not as hard as i thought it would have been.  OMGOSH IT IS THE BEST!  ok.  enough of that.  well i guess im done writing for tonight.  have a goodnight.  bon soir.
