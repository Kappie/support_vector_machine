(d'oh!)does anyone know i went to a volcano? yea. we walked like 16 km and my feet's skin started to fall off. I think we're going now, so bye... Oh yea, i got a new cellphone, its got windows smartphone, its really cool, its like 4 years more advanced than all of the other phones out there, its got mp3 internet (www, not wap) wma, camera, COOL. my aunt forgot her candle for the baptism, so they somehow got it. why a candle? whats the candle for? ill find out today. lalala. Theres so much to tell but there is no time.. i wish i was a blogger freak once again. GOOD medieval total war's download will finish in about three hours, that means that when i come back, iwill already have the game. GOD! one hour! :D:D:D:D  I dont know what else to say, my dad bought something to make my bike stationary, (ive got a road bike, and you dont, hee hee) and figured out that my bike is too small already. the only way to make it fit is either buying a new handle, because mine was a small one or buying a new bike. The new bike will be cheap, because the guy who sells the bikes is a friend of my dad (like all of the other bike shop owners) and will accept the used bike and give us a cheap price for the next one. my mom says lets go bye  okbyethanks.
