I was quite amused by the way it was written, for example:   !  You must not use internet chat rooms or E-Mail   then went on to say:    !  You must not send or use bad language  !  You must not give out personal information  !  You must treat others with respect  As if to say: "You can't use chat rooms, but if you happened to magically stumble across one and accidentally use it... do not swear, insult or spread your phone number around it!"    Anyway.  James went home before break because he banged his head or summat.  The general attitude toward him around the table at break wasn't a pleasant one, due to things he had been saying behind peoples backs, a usual thing that James does   Next came a double period in W1; Geography and Chemisty, oh how fun!  The latter was more boring due to it being a revision lesson, but hardly anyone revised by the sounds of things.  It started belting it down half way through and I went out in it.  God, we got soaked!    Me and Craig went with Sam to his house and we just messed around with Blogs for about 20 minutes before returning to school in the calmer weather.    On the way there and back we discussed what we should do on the computers.  I thought I'd make a "Day at School" flash movie.  It could end with a dark lesson of Information Systems.  Somethig dark and hooded with a long, waving cloak enters the room, then thunder strikes sending light scattering across the room.  The light clicks on, and Mrs. Chekcetts is standing there at the door holding a few books, and says, "Hello Children!"  English was cool.  During the process of analysing another poem, the heavens opened yet again, this time chucking a few bolts of LIGHTNING down with it!!   Yes it was THUNDERING wooooooo!  I love thunder so it was like a momentus occasion for me.  The sound of the large raindrops pattering down on the roof was very calming, backed by the odd growl of thunder.  Ahhh, good old English weather.  Information Systems was normal.  We exited there for assembly, then afterwards to a windy outdoor, yes, the wind had arrived!  Whooooooshhh.  Not done a lot at home.  Only 19 more school days to go!  It sounds like NOTHING at all!!  In a couple of months I might not even be in England at all, yet again, the chances of staying in England to start school again in September is looking more likely...
