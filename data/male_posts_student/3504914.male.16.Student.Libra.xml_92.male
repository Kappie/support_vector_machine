No neither have I, but that's not the point.  The point is that Doom 3 has set the new standerd for FPS games. Besides ID Software creating the bloody catagory in the first place, ID are known for releasing rock solid game engines which define the gaming industry.  Anyone who is anyone has played the original Doom. If someone told me they have never played it before, I wouldn't hesitate in punching them in the face right on the spot. Who can forget the crappy MIDI music, the growling as you walk down a lonley corridor, or blasting the shit out of a monster at point blank range with the beloved shotgun?  The next installment of the Doom series is nothing short of an visual experience. Nvidia have pumped out thier 6800 ultra that supports engines for Doom 3 for christ's sake. You know it must be good.  And it couldn't come soon enough. ID software have put a lot of time and effort, with development starting right after Quake 3 was released. Level design looks nothing short of amazing. Shadows are catsed on models themselves, with distinct realism never seen before. Animation is fluid and flows together perfectly and gameplay was designed to be done alone in the dark...  Of course, with detail comes lack of quantity, as there is no way, with the amount of detail in each model, that you can have too many models at one. This means that the shit load of monsters that Doom was known for, will not be as present. Small price to pay, but still.  You will want a damn good computer though. About 2.4 ghz with that beloved 6800 ultra and a shit load of RAM should do you. Pity I'm still on a Pentium 3 huh. (Fuck up Dammo xD)  So relive your childhood. Buy me a new computer, and let the walk to hell and back begin!    Source From: Me reading Hyper Magazine in the newsagent this afternoon.    Dammo's Notes: On those graphics, Alec neglects to mention that some of the graphics are still 2D. He also neglects to mention that Doom 3 is still shit compared to Far Cry, with only one advantage over it, and that's character models xD  Dammo's Notes by Alec: Also, I'm a smelly bitch who has to do a 10 minute presentation by tomorrow. This is because I am stupid. After giving shit about Alec doing the same, I have stupidly gone off and left it to the last minute. (You stupid cunt xD I just have to give in the papers, not actually do the presentation- Dammo)
