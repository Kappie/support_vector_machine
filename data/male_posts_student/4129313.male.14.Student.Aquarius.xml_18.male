I have to ride my bike to and from school each day, and never before have I ever been so sweaty when I got home. I was even close to passing out. And ontop of all that someone had stole my water bottle, and my front tire was flat. Now onto class news. I read my book all period long second period. I just got into it. PE today being 4th period and all, in the heat of the day, I could hardly run I was so hot. Tomorrow I either have to walk the perimeter of the field, or run up and down the steps AND around the perimeter of a whole damn football field. Drinkwine won't tell us which one yet. I had yet another salad at lunch today, VERY deliciouse, I'v been needing a reason to slim down. We got our books in 6th period (German 1) today.  I was playing Postal 2 all weekend, I still can't find the multi player addon anywhere. I went out and bought some german software to aid me in 6th period, but the installer was broken on all five CD's, I'm probably gonna have to find something on the internet somewhere.
