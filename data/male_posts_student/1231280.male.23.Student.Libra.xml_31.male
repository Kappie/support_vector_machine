Candice was impressed (Brownie points?)If you would like to view my hard work - check it out here: http://www.people.ku.edu/~sieckman/index.html Very very tired. Just have one class tmorrow and then catching up on much needed sleep after that. Anyways, gonna rain like a banshee here tonight so I think I'm gonna hop in the sack so it will help me get my much needed sleep. Out
