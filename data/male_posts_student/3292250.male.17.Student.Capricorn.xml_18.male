Not that America is so gay-friendly right now, but it  is  Kansas after all. Lucky for me its the Kansas City area and not Salina or Hays or Dodge City (you know these places if you're from Kansas); hell I'm doin' fine in West Virginia. The "hope for me in Kansas" isn't really that big of a deal, or all that directly related to me.  Getting to the point, if you watched the Miami season of  The Real World , then you know  urlLink Dan Renzi . I don't remember Miami all that well, and I actually forgot he was gay (I know, I know, how dare I forget such a thing)! As I was reading and clicking about  urlLink Steph  Alek 's blog I came across Dan's blog and started reading it. What can I say, I love reading other people's life. It's really cool, you should try it (err, wait... you are). The point of the story: he's from the KC area and he's really cute. So there are cute boys in KC, you just have to find them first. That's the hard part. You can't just walk up to any guy and hit on 'em; that's how you get your ass kicked in the Midwest.
