I woke up at lunch time, went to the beach, took the book i'm reading with me and had a tipical lonely sunday at the beach, it wasn't much hot, quietly warm. With a man making a rena tattoo - it's a tatoo that stays on he skin for about 2 weeks - on a guy's arm. I wouldn't let a guy draw a tattoo on my arm, they usually use dirty pens, and the beach is not the cleanest place to do it. Ew ew ew.  I watched Tv all long afternoon, poor old couch, it will be replaced, I'll miss it - HAuHAuHAuHAu-, mom is gonna buy another one.
