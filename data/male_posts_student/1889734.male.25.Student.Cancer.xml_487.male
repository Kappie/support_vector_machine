The French and Russian administers of the Oil for Food program funneled billions of dollars to Saddam as kickbacks, in exchange for shipping shoddy goods or even phantom shipments.  So the French and Russians make money by NOT supplying food and medicine, and Saddam gets his money to build the military.  Now the French UN ambassador is stonewalling the Security Council investigation.  It also turns out that the son of the SecGen of the UN, Kofi Anan, worked for the auditing firm awarded the contract to assure the program was legitimate.  It's all quite a mess, and it continues to explain the 'principled' objections of the French and the Russians prior to the war.
