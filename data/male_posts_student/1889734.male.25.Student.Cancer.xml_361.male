This does cause me to be prejudiced against homosexuals because I assume they will have the opinions of their majority. Or at least their most vocal representatives.   Now, on marriage, that seems to me to be between man and a woman. I see no reason for the government to favor one citizen or couple of citizens over any other. The government is in the business of promoting social behavior, unfortunately. It seems that is accepted now and expected. I refer you to welfare, Earned Income Tax Credit, Food stamps as being means to favor bastard children and poverty. Marriage is already favored and encouraged by the deductions and various other benefits acquired by married couples. Should "civil unions" be included in that group? I say yes.  The true question is of course money. I don't give a rat's ass about the "sanctity of marriage." That's a load of crap. It is merely someone's desire to impress upon others their own worldview. Mainly by religious adherents. Two men or two women forming a household is none of my business. I can exclude them from my own private groups, property, and such but the government has no reason to do so. It violates equal treatment under the law.  The problem with allowing such unions to me is the loophole it creates. I honestly would form such a union with a total stranger just so I could save money. Why shouldn't I? It would be like seniors getting divorced so they can get more social security money. Nothing changed between them, but their status in the eyes of government. So now we must ask why the gays want to have marriages just like the heteros have it.  I know that gays are seeking this "right" to marry and be recognized as the same as straight people because they are at heart rebels and this is their latest cause. I feel uncomfortable being on their side, but I feel it is morally right to allow them to claim the same benefits as a married couple.
