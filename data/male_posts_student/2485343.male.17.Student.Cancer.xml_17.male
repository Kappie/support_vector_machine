The boy receives a phone call, the one who has broken his heart calls for a rebound guy, not now. The boy hangs up the phone and thinks to himself 'don't let her break you again.' he reminisces on the moment of lust and of passion he felt for the girl. It has all turned to resentment. The girl they call Lindsey had walked into his life only to destroy it. he hates her for it. She made an honest boy, a boy who treats girls with the upmost respect, she made him cheat on a girl who had strong feelings for. The night, still young. The trust he has left for her, none.             He continues his journey to the city of Broomfield, a place where no one knows his name. he meets up with a girl who he had feelings for but never had the courage to tell her so. She looks like a movie-star. She takes his breath away. They go to see a motion picture. Nothing eventful happens because he is nervous, he is self-conscious, he knows nothing. The boy heads for home, kicking himself for missed opportunity. The song about the best night of his life plays. he parks the car and heads for the door. The boy is back to where he started. The girl named Lindsey calls him. he hangs up and enters his house.
