Hopefully we will be sending George W. back to your great state shortly...John Kerry's been my boy from the get-go. But I'd best move on before I start a political feud on this blog. Started work last week at a bank (following in Ulli's footsteps). I, however, don't clean toilets and shoot intruders. I get to stand behind the counter, pretend like I know what I'm doing, and give people ridiculous sums of cash. Guy the other day wanted $8000, and then some woman came in wanting $3. We serve all sorts, I guess. This lady is convinced the police have her entire home bugged. I survived Valentine's Day with minimal damage...some flowers, dinner at my girlfriend's hall, a trip to Blockbuster to rent The Hours. Cheap evening all in all. Wrote in to the school paper about my trip home in October for this Stupid or Cupid contest and won second prize in the Cupid category. I think if I had included the reason for the trip I could've won both Stupid and Cupid prizes. Was planning a trip to BCN in March, but me boss told me to dream on. The whole reason I got the job was to pay for the trip to BCN, and now it's the job that's keeping me from going. Good to see that Ulli has taken to posting warm fuzzy forwards on the blog now. Guess he got tired of the penguin game. Well, off to do homework now...don't remember doing much of that last semester. Bye kids.  Tim
