The other three of course being England, Australia, and New Zealand.  But seriously, Seneca looks to good to be true only 8000 dollars for two semesters?  Holy shit.  That's perfectamente, largest college in Canada as well, and they like international students.  Damn, it looks so perfect.  Then I've got McGill on the list as well, because, it's also in Canada.  Then my two American choices would be Brown (I wish) and University of Virginia.
