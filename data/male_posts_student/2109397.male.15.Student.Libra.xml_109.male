It dont go no damn gizmos and shit that I dont give a flying fuck about.  I was looking through my yearbook and I realised how little I want to return to Ballard. I dunno how bad the first, second, third and all 174 days of school will be but I think the first is the worst, especially this year. Seeing people after summer is so GAY everyones all fucking giddy and shit and I'm like WOO SHUT THE FUCK UP dont you realise school has started. Freedom is gone dumbshits. If you want to start school I resent you for life.   Soccer sucks I still feel as though I am playing like shit yet everyone tells me different. I do not believe what they say, I think they lie.  I do so often what it is that a preach about hating. Like prejudgment. I say that preps are asses and shit because they are, but also I say that they dont give people chances etc. a lot of times I dont eithr but it's usually the preps I dont give chances etc. so I guess it works out in the end anyways.  Me and Griffin had a little chat earlier about what we would do when or if we play Tripp in soccer. If you would like to know a funny thing I thought notify me, I don't want to put anything here for fear of a future lawsuit filed by the fag himself.  Peace
