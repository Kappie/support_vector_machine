Guess who can't go because he's got class? You guessed it. I should just skip. But I won't. I'm a good boy. Fuck. I'm an idiot boy.  And my dad gets great fucking tickets. They're corporate tickets, which usually means front row. I would be a few feet away from my future bride! I'm quivering.  Another reason to learn Russian: it will greatly help me achieve my life's greatest ambition: to woo and marry Anastasia Myskina.       Replace the tennis ball with a skull, she could be playing Hamlet. She so perty.
