Today i had a very mind draining and stressing exam (Structural Analysis). Went into the exam keep thinking its a 2hours paper till i got a shock when the examiner say its 3hours... Well that was wat me and my classmates thought it would be. Well after going through the questions, i realised that i got alot of time to day dream because i could only understand 2/4 questions. Well, since that is over i should leave it to fate then. My next paper is also the last paper, is on the 25th. I decided that i should give myself a day of break before i start touching the books again.  Gen my good friend whom introduced me to this wonderful website asked me to join Cat,Jazon and her for dinner afer their exam tonight. Didn't felt like eating at first, but the food (Veg  tofu, Calamari, Sweet  sour pork, spring onions  fish) was so much and so good that i decided to chip in and help them eat.  Wow.. such a long winded start to advertising my life, hehe hope i will persist in updating this website like a diary..  Good Luck to the rest of our exams!!
