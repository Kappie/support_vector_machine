No seriously, I read  everyone's  - Zoe, regan, Joel, Bonnie, Katherine, Lisa, Todd, Brendan etc) I remembered that I've forgotten to put in my "currently listening to" line. Which is certainly a pertinent issue, seeing as I'm listening to....    McFly.   There. I said it, ok? And the thing that will have you all boaking is that  I'm Bopping my freakin SOCKS off to this tune!  I mean, seriously, who can turn down the cheerful welcome of "Obviously"? I implore you.  Anyways, I walked the walk of shame in the process of buying the album in Sainsbury's yesterday, part of the reason why I didn't mention in yesterdays post  (see fill-in post)  about our lil shopping ttrip, what with the shameful memory being too close in time to my traumatic experience an all. WELL, my darling sister back from Malaysia, because of my hilarity at the fact she hasn't eaten a sandwich for a year, becuase in Malaysia they don't really "do" bread  (see fill-in blog) ( werid, nein?)   , got me back big-style by exclaiming on my purchase  all the way to the checkout.  Ugh. Sigh, 'twas a very, VERY embarressing walk of shame, I must say. It felt like everyone was gonna turn round in the queue, nudging each other and pointing to my sinful, tweeny-bop purchase burning a hole in my hanging hand.  .. Oh well, it was a fair exchange for the sandwich laughing.  And to top it off, my good friend Barnett castigated me for buying the bleedin thing on msn last night! I'm sorry, ok? It was an instinct thing. sigh. Anyways seriously now thanks Barnett for being advicey and dudish, despite me not ever replying to it, on account of writing my blog ; )  Smiles (Smiling much, much more than my previous post, because despite the keys incident  (See evil thrives when good men do nothing post)  McFly have got me hopping with joy again. So THERE, nasty people. Lol.  Currently listening to: Yes, you've guessed it. McFly, Room on the third Floor. Or, more specifically, the modern classic - yes really - "Obviously".
