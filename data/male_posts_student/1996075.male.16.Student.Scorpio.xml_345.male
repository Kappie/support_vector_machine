"i dont think so tim"   ooo its all new and pretty and suchness! i was seriously worried that christy had counted out all the posts lol...that would have taken forever...  you know a school weeks going to be bad when the first day of the week (aka monday) feels like the last day (aka friday)...lets hope that friday wont feel like monday...twould suck, but not as much as monday feeling fridayish  the day really wasnt that bad...it either went by really fast or really slow and i dont really remember much about it...im thinking the first option...which is good...hopefully the week will be like that...at least today wasnt rainy...hence the carpenters song.  ok so yeah talking to michael and im done with this post, so im gonna go and fix a typo i see on my bloggity...woo  ~mOoLaU~
