He never stops, never sleeps, never looks back.  The wraiths that persue him know no death.  Destroy them, and they return more numerous and stronger. You cannot defeat them. Pac Man is pure futility. There is no winning. Pac Man must lose.  It is only a matter of time.   The wraiths that persue him know no death.  He never ceases, always consuming, always running. He strives for a goal which can not be attained. Pac Man does not live. He lives to die. He is meaningless. No matter how long he evades the furies, they will get him. No matter how many he consumes, they will get him. He can not hide, they will find him, and they will get him. It is only a matter of time.   End Transmission.  EDIT: THERE IS NO TRANSMISSION TO END! THIS POST NEVER HAPPENED!
