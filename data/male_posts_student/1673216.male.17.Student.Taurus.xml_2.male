And since my computer is being really odd right now I'll just keep typing if it freezes. Before I bore you with my confusion, I'll let you know whats been going on the past few ...time periods. I went to my cabin, that was really cool. I didn't get to swim =( it rained a bit I think... I can't remember really. Oh my back started to twinge... Hold on while I sit back in my chair.   ::Moments later!:: Wow my back feels better now! ::Just then!:: Oh sheesh I just realized my toasies are cold ::Suddenly!:: Socks....upstairs! ::Finally:: My toes are saved once again!  Now that I've made my life a living comic book I can continue... Yea I know that was lame and you shouldn't laugh at it, you will probably just be like ::tisk tisk:: donnie is weird :P. Well good I don't want anyone to think anything BUT that. Seriously... I could care less. So now I will tell you what I did recently... I went to my cabin (the Butts' were there, and I know you two are going to read this at some time.. And I also know you seem to like to be mentioned in my stuff :D so here ya go). Went to cousins (Last time seeing an aunt uncle and cousin for a looonng while :-/). Went to Soccer party (I played goalie, it was cool). The party was the best of those three... Since I am deep into a couple of conversations I don't feel like elaborating on those too much. So anyway let me see what I can type...Oh ya my sister Christy wants to be mentioned too, although I can't see why... She likes to snoop into my profile once or twice a...minute :P. Why do I feel like a need a shower now ;-). Anycow, I had something grand to type, but now I don't feel like remembering what it was. So you should all go to www.16yearoldreflections.blogspot.com for my good friend John's blog... He is really an awesome person, and it brings me down to think I'll be missing his presence when I move (Hey good thing is that you can still talk to me on the phone for 2 hours about religion! Oh no I'm not being sarcastic... I loved doing that it was fun). So lately I've been listening to the following bands: Evanescence, Sum 41, Godsmack, R.Kelly, U2, Jack Johnson, Usher, and Elvis... Some of those won't make sense, because they just are in some soccer clips that I've seen. So when I hear them, I picture the moves that are being pulled during that video.. I love soccer more then I ever loved hockey or baseball for the 6 year period that I played them.. But I'm afraid it won't be so fun anymore when I don't have to usual crew to play with... Maybe the Vegas people will be mean, not friendly, or really really good and I can't even compete.. I'll see what I can do, eh? I want to learn to draw. Teach me in like 5 minutes Mike. (Oh my I hope he doesn't read that he'll kill me) Hey look Mike, it's Legolas! o.o So bored! Someone IM me at toxictree6 and tell me what to type. I'll type something after that! End blog =/
