Two new faces showed up in our class, a guy  a girl. It should take some time for them to get use to us and our class motto ‘if you’re not doing, so will I’. HEhehee… Maybe even longer… Ohya almost forgot, LESTER LOST HIS N GAGE… now there’s no body that will play with me le…. Sob Sob…  As soon as we turned up in school, an assignment was already waiting for us. We have to work in groups assigned by out tutors, not the groups we had in mind. The Brothers Five (a gang of 5 dirty minded guys  an innocent girl following us around) has been scatted except for Cher Hao  Dan as they are in one group. After we were brief on what to do, we set off to Punggol Block 101 where the sail landmark is. We didn’t get lost over there and even reached the sail before the lecturers.  I have to say I’m really at lost on what to do over there, so my group split up the work. I’m covering materials and the reasons so it. I though simple task for me as it was very straight forward, that was until I came across materials that I don’t know how to name. Did some 2D technical rough drawings on how different material elements were actually put together. Taking notes on recyclable materials and façade treatment with materials. Then we headed to the sky garden above a car park near by, I don’t fell elevated at all because the garden was enclosed. After gathering just about enough details, my group planned for the next trip and dispersed.   And so the Brothers Five gathered, making a trip back to Compass point to get a little something as a birthday present of our brother Dan who didn’t turn up for the field trip. Sure enough, we got him a ‘little’ something. =^_^=.. we got him a G-string, well not exactly one because there only has a stripe that goes around the waist and a ‘pouch’ for the ‘you know where’. I spent so much time laughing as we chose the colour and size that my cheeks cramped. Poor Shawn was made to pay for it, and my poor bag was used to keep it. Even now, it’s still inside my bag. Don’t think I want to unpack my bag today.   Okie, it’s time off dinner le, and after that I’ll be doing some research. BubbyeZ~
