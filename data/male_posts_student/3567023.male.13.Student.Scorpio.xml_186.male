SO, I have been looking over the posts, which I really don't get to do that often, and I read everywhere, particularly in Paula's(moo) posts, that everyone urges everyone else to post. So as I sit here, feeling miserably out of contact, I realize that noone has posted in the last two *************************ing days. How lonely and MISLEAD I feel. anyway, in case noone heard it the first time, POST!! NOW!! OR I WILL SNEAK INTO YOUR HOUSE AT NIGHT AND SHOVE A MOTHERBOARD AND MODEM SO FAR UP YOUR REAR END THAT YOU WILL QUITE SIMPLY BE DEAD. Thanks  -Lax
