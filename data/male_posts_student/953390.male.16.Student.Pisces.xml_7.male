To make the long story short, I probably got a horrible grade because  someone  can't do their damn lines. What was  I  supposed to do? Buttface. >:-} I also got my AP U.S. History summer work today. You know, maybe I should not do it this year. It's going to be very hard, doing 3 AP classes. That's three exams, three times as much HW, dear God! What have I gotten myself into?! So here I sit. Home early. Tomorrow I'm out  early.  10:20, to be exact.  You know what, I want some tacos for dinner.
