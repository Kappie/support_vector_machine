      I have just finished my Radio Page for me and my friend Radio Station, it is called "Universal Geeks", I have a list of all the show times and who will be hosting that show  The Radio Show will offically begin May 28, the beginning of Summer. I can't wait to get started, this is going to be the best project that I have done in a long time.
