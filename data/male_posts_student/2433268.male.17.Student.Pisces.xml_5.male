Go through school, hang out with my friends, and if I had time flirt a bit or just have some carefree fun.  It's hard to realize there comes a day when all of a sudden you have to actually decide for yourself where you are going, and what you want to do.  There's no turning back from those kind of choices, and they decide many times who you meet and what your going to do for the rest of your life.  Many people try to avoid the choice, pretend it's not there.  Do something temporary for a while.  But the choice is still there, and you still have to face it.   Well, enough of my rambling, I need to get back to work...
