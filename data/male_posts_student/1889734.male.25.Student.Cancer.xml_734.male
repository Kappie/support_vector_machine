The hacked out a few paragraphs that I thought were particularly meaningful!  Here's the whole thing for those who didn't see it the first time.  The recent controversy over photographs of our fallen soldiers returning to the US illustrates fundamental flaws in the positions of both sides.  The Pentagon claims that they wish to protect the privacy of the families.  That is a noble sentiment, but the anonymity of a flag draped coffin is assured.  In fact, as a symbol, the image serves as a reminder of the integrity, honor and dedication expressed by each of our volunteer soldiers who place our nation above themselves and their family.  It is our responsibility to understand the consequence of what they do for us, and to respect their sacrifice.  The Pentagon’s ultimate motivation stems from the immature and cynical nature of our national media.  There is little doubt that these images will be used in an attempt to destroy our resolve to see this conflict through to the end.  The merchants of cynicism have little use for the larger ideas represented by those coffins, seeking only to discredit, undermine and cheapen the meaning of the sacrifice.  However, the media’s failing to behave as adults is not a sufficient excuse for the Pentagon to hide these images.  (Removed by Gazette) War is a brutal and nasty thing, but when a nation decides to embark on this course, it deserves the seriousness of mature adults.  If our general population lacks the stomach and resolve, then we should not place our soldiers in harm’s way.  If our people wish to abdicate our position in the world by demonstrating our unwillingness to defend our way of life, then we are not worthy of the sacrifice of these men and women.    The best way to end these images is to treat this conflict with the seriousness it requires.  We need to engage the war fully, and remove political restrictions from the calculus of combat.  The lesson of Viet Nam continues to go unlearned by the majority of people in this nation.    (removed by Gazette) John Stuart Mill said it best.  “War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things.  The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling that thinks nothing is worth war is much worse.”  These images are a reminder that there are still men and women in this country who understand the burden of being free in a largely tyrannical world, and are willing to carry that burden despite the scorn with which that idea is held by certain elements in the very society they strive to protect.
