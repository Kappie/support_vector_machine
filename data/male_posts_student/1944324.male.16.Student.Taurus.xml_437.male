Then I complained, and stuff was said about lesbians in Arkansas, but thats not the point. The point is that now she  is  my super hot way-cool girlfriend, unless the fact that everyone and there mother knows creeps her out so much that she'll not dump me, but viciously throw me down like an annoying chipmunk sitting on her shoulder and biting her ear.  I really,  really  hope she doesn't do that.  I may be kinda weird, but after a while it makes perfect sense, to me atleast.  I've been dealing with some akwardness too, but you know, you're worth a bit of confusion.   The Betty-one looks drowsy!
