To protect the innocent (and me), I will not be doing a boring transcript of the weekend. I will however mention a few highlights:  a) My handwriting while drunk is identical to my normal handwriting. And we're not talking about being a wee bit tipsy. This guy told me that he fell in love with his best friend but was still straight. This seemed extremely important to me, so I went to great lengths to fetch paper and pencil to write this down. I woke up with this paper in my pocket followed by a very brief but appropriate silence.  b) The gang's drink of choice was Smirnoff mixed with Whiskey and lime. Highly recommended. However, be careful when making your second one. You may put in way too much whiskey the second time, making it extremely strong, making you go over to the couch and have conversations with strangers about gayness that I then proceed to write about on paper.  c) People from Long Beach are not allowed to do Rocky. Ever. The most obvious reason is that there  is no fucking dance for "Hot Patootie!"  They also just are missing a lot of great lines. The only good one I heard them do that was new to me was "Cause I've seen  Brad's cock , through the tears  Where did he cum?  in my eyes.  d) The entire LA area is cursed. I've never been there and not gotten lost at least once. This was no exception. It's the Hellmouth at work.  e) I got to see my penis size rule at work. "Are you Jewish?" "No." "There you go. Don't feel bad about it."  For full details about this weekend, (And believe me, you want them) call me or talk to me or something. Or *cough* Kelly *cough*.
