I know these things are stupid, but I had a lot on my mind, and unlike you, I do have emotions......I suppose I sound gay on here, but oh well. I'm not gonna deny I have feelings for things, and I'm not gonna devote this whole thing to making fun of people, thats getting less and less amusing to me, as strange as that may sound. Oh well, I'm sure this post will get made fun of too. After all, isn't that what makes life so great for you Daniel? Anyhow, don't fear, I don't plan on having to many posts like that.
