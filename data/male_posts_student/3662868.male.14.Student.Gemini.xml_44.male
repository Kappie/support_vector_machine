(I'll have pictures later if anyone cares to see) I'm kickin myself in the ass for not bringing some fireworks with me. Becky, if you want some fireworks, feel free to go get some from my house...well, even if you did go, theres no way to get in. So, sorry about that.  Happy 4th of July everyone...I'm gonna go play Yuri's Revenge...byez.
