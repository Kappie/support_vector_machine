During 5th period the sub took attendance a few times at least, Tyke was only there for the first one but it probably isn't a problem just cuz Tyke is the man and he can't get in trouble.  Especially since he has to start working in there again cuz his teacher shouldn't be gone for a while.  Damn, that sucks.  Tyke is gonna die if he can't just walk around school all day.  5th period has been awesome.  Tyke walked around and found himself by Kinker's class for a while.  He talked to Kinker and a few junior girls before heading off to his car.  Then he waited for Purdy and they sat in her car before heading off to Physics and talking there.  And drawing her "pi" vein.  Then Tyke had to go to Redmond to return his fedora from Tolo.  But that was actually a little fun cuz Tyke listened to great music on the great system in the Avalon.  He had the sun roof open on the drive there but it started to drizzle (and get inside the car again) on the way back so he had to close it.  Tyke once again got nice and cozy and noticed that he could fall asleep if he didn't start focusing more so he changed to some good pump-up songs and he was fine.  It is so easy to just fall asleep driving.  When Tyke was little he had no idea how easy it is.  And today it was broad daylight when Tyke got sleepy.  But the Avalon is just soo nice.  So smooth.  So luxurious.  So musically enhanced.  Just heaven.  Minus all of the freaking hot chicks.  So basically it is totally not heavenly.  But it is not hellish.  Somewhere in the middle.  Leaning towards the heaven side though.  But not quite.  Almost.  A little off.  Not too much.  But not too little.  Juuuust right.  Zzzzzzzz...Click.  Yep.  Tyke didn't fall asleep at home today.  And he worked on his baller a lot too.  Kinker is very good.  Almost perfect now.  That is fun.  Fun stuff.  No homework done either.  Funner stuff.  Fun fun.  Bye bye.  Tyke writes this topless.  After he was calling a game and season of basketball while he played on his hoop downstairs.  Tyke Turner had an awesome season.  29 PPG, 5 APG, 8 RPG, 2.9 SPG, 1.6 BPG, 44 MPG.  All were said in Tyke's discussion of himself.  It was a good game.  But he lost the NBA Finals despite having 2 buzzer beating shots to win games in the first playoff round, 1 in the second round, and 2 in the finals.  But he couldn't win the last game.  He led the Cavaliers to a great season in which they didn't win a single game by more than 9 points but never lost one by more than 9 either.  They were a very even-keel team led by Tyke and Lebron.  Yeah, everything Tyke just wrote he said in his playing.  That is how detailed Tyke gets.
