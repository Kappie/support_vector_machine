Once again you're bringing out the demons in me    Don't you ever forget I once brought you such great pains    Tell me something... while toying with me, what do you gain?    You plant false information about my reputation    While raising yourself amongstthe ranks of this modern society    Don't you ever forget you are where you are with my help    Once again you take me for a fool better kick your can    Cause I won't be doing it for you this time... kick your own can    Why don't you just wither up and die leave me alone    Once again I have to go and do these things to you    Don't you ever look at me that way again... you might not be able to the next time
