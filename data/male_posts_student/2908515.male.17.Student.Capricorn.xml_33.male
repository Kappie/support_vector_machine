It was a much needed break from the regular everyday stuff.  Although I have had contact with people people, I love being with Charlotte because she makes me happy.   Charlotte came over after dinner and the two of us walked to the park to the very same place where Matt and I shared our first kiss.  Our first date together.  Along the way, I told her the story.  Of course, I had already told her most of it online.  But this time, I wanted to tell it in person to a real person.  And she was a great listener.  She says she is happy that we are together.  And I like that.  She feels bad that she can't meet Matt.  And I feel bad too.  She's leaving again on Thursday.  Everyone is leaving.  And I am left here.  Of course we talked about other things.  We can never run out of things to tell each other.  Even when we are silent, I feel like I am experiencing her too.  Words without sound, I guess.  To sound poetic.  She talked about this guy that she barely knew at her place that she works at in Gettysburg.  How she always admired him and had a little crush on him.  And how she felt so bad when she didn't know what to say to him until after he left.  He is leaving for Missouri.  And she feels bad because she didn't have anytime to know him.  His full name, nonetheless.  And in a way, I know that feeling.  To have someone leave before they know or before I know what is really going on.  She always talked about how her mother looks down on people sometimes.  I had always thought her mother to be good.  But I guess everyone has a bit of black on them.  Charlotte's mom sometimes talks about people behind their backs.  Or thinks she is better than them.  Which could be true, I'm not doubting.  But sometimes, modesty works.  We discussed destiny.  I am reading a Buddhist book on ways to change destiny.  LiaoFan.  It's very interesting.  Ordinary people are destined to have what they have.  It's no use to fight or pursue anything with great vigor because they are destined to have that in the end.  However, enlightened people let go of their attachments and truely gain what they want even if it doesn't fit into their destiny.  They gain both spiritually and worldly.  "Riches to last ten generations".  Do good deeds and everything will be good.  I like talking to her.  There is a small group of people who I like to talk to about a lot of things.  Matt, Charlotte, Kevin.  I can't think of anyone else.  Those people always intrigue me and I feel like I can say anything I want to them.  It's a good feeling.  Wow, the place that Matt and I sat for the first time together is so beautiful.  Willow tree and a stream right by.  Its so peaceful.  I love it.  Afterwards, Charlotte suggested that we go to see the Village.  To the theaters.  Sure, why not.  I like to spend time with her.  She's a wonderful person.  We tried to call Matt Quaglia.  But he couldn't go, his parents were out of town.  And we tried to get Alex Manzi to come with us but he wasn't home.  So it was just Charlotte and me.  I liked it better that way.  I could talk about things more openly.  I had a free movie ticket thing so I didn't have to pay.  But I drove us there.  I paid for the drink.  The popcorn was free too.  Which was cool.  I saw Izzy there.  He works at the movie theaters.  I don't know if he still considers me a good friend.  We are so different now, its sad.  We used to be best friends back in kindergarten.  I don't know how two people could change that much.  But I guess its possible.  Sadly.  I hope my friends right now, I hope I don't grow far apart from them.  Especially with Matt and Charlotte.   The movie was awesome.  Somewhat scary.  Suspenceful.  It is way better than Signs.  I did not like Signs at all.  And some of the scenes in the movie was gorgeous.  Picturesque.  If thats how you spell it.  The thing I loved the most was the music.  The violin was awesome.  And the solo violin accompanyed by the small orchestra really fit the mood of the movie.  It was so natural that a violin would be playing during some scenes.   I had wanted to see this movie with Matt.  But I don't think spending two hours staring at a movie screen was the best way to spend our last two hours together.  I wonder how he is.  I wonder if he wonders about me.   At the place where Matt and I were together first, in the park, Charlotte gave me a green bag with a pink rock in it.  I forgot what the rock was called.  But it symbolyzed love and was for people who will/was/are going through tremendous hardships.  And she said that once Matt leaves, I would need all the good luck I can get.  I think, right now, that when Matt leaves, I would not be so much as sad, but as silent.  I don't think I will cry.  Or be sad.  It is sad that I have given up a lot of my emotions.  Well, not give them up, but learned to hide them so well.  And only in my solitude that I can express them.  To myself.  And always to myself.  But this time, I won't express sadness in the form of tears, I will express sadness in a smile.  That I will carry with me.  Maybe I'm an ordinary person and my destiny will guide me to my destination.  Maybe I'm an ordinary person in which all actions to change my destiny will be ultimately futile.  I wish not.  Because I wish to see Matt again.  But then if my destiny is to end up with Matt, then I wish badly to be an ordinary person so that my destiny carry me safely.  Matt.  To you, I want to say this.  You have made me happy. You have caused me to shed tears, as I am doing right now, at this very moment.  You have made me angry.  You have made me feel emotions I never expected to feel.  I thank you.  I don't know if I have been so potent on you.  I don't know if I had been powerful enough to stir strong emotions from you.  But it doesn't matter.  You will always be right here, in my heart.  Some part in my heart.  In so many days, weeks, months, years, lifetimes, we can be reunited.  And then we can have all the time in the world to do whatever.  Like wash dishes.   I don't know what to say, really.  I want to say something.  But what?  Maybe in my silence, words will appear.  Maybe by my past actions, paragraphs will form in your head of my gratitude, my happiness, and my sorrow.  The Wall is almost complete.  Take my hand and we will climb one last time.  After which, only cracks in the wall will we see each other.  But time will pass and the wall will crumble.  And we shall be able to hold each other's hands once again.  And the world shall be ours.  To enjoy.   Geeze, my eyes are watery.  And my nose runny.  Must be the dust in here.   Sigh.
