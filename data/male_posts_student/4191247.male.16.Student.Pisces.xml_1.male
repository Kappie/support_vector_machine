But following a night out with a bunch of mates, I quite honestly could not be much happier. Maybe I'm just temperamental.  Anyway, tonight I went bowling along with about a third of the squadron. And I didn't lose at all. I won both games (five strikes in one night, a personal record), and I then proceeded to thrash Ollie Slough at air hockey (or whatever the game with the paddles and the puck and the floaty table is called). Overall I really am quite proud of myself.  And of course tomorrow looks quite bright as well. I'm wandering down the Northampton Balloon Festival (probably with a few friends) and I plan to loiter around the Nintendo booth because I am a sad geek. But hey, that's my role in life and I plan to enjoy it.  Anyway, if there is anyone reading this (which I am now seriously beginning to doubt), may you have many enjoyable things happen to you, as I really am feeling quite fluffy.
