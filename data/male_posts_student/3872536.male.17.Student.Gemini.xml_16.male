We actually managed to finish all the doorgift by today lor, all the painting n writing of words. So satisfied with our product from far. Coz the doorgifts look so colourful n nice from far, but when one actually moves closer, it's like you'll see many cracks on it lor. So I was suggesting that we'll show the guests how nice our gifts are but when distributing the stuff, we'll off the lights and when they actually see it at home it's like we've already stepped down, so it's not our busi lor. Juz being lame then lah. Enjoy so much doing the gifts lol. Then eat lotsa stuff 4 lunch coz damn hungry (rojak n mince meat noodle lor).  After tat go TM shop for xxx birthday present lol. But didn't realli think of wat to buy coz it's either too ex or I think it's not suitable for her lol. Haiz gona go out another day to buy again lor. I think lai wei n jia yin are quite irritated wif mi lah coz i always can't make up my mind lol. Nevertheless we had one neoprint taken n it's like quite cute lol coz jia yin want mi n lai wei stick our tongue out lol n it's like something gals do lol. Nevertheless, I did it lol for the fun of it, but that lai wei never do lor then I look so weird in there lol. But never mind it's fun :P  After which go new house see how's the lighting like. Quite satisfied wif it coz it's my family n my hardwork in finding the lights lol.  Yah so today can be said to be a day of satisfaction for me man... Fianlly... Haha. How nice everday's like today, no worries bout tutorials n JCT haha...
