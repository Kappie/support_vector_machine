     
      Just to clear up the insatiable craving for milk thing.  Although I list veganism on my interests, I am not vegan.  I recently went vegetarian, and over the next few months I hope to phase all animal products out of my life.    It's gonna be hard but it's worth it.  I no longer want to contribute to the suffering and deaths of millions of animals world wide every year.    Maybe you can give me some vegetarian recipes.  Oh and I no longer crave milk.  In fact I haven't drunken it for a week now.  I have soy milk in my fridge.  It's kinda gross but I'll get used to it (I hope).
