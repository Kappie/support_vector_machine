       
      As I start to get back in the groove Upon scorched black pavement anew Doing that thing which some may shun, I run and I run and I run  And soon I decide to choose After this day has seemed a rouse, To run hard and think long While listening to some random song  I slowly slip on my running shoes Go out of the house, into the blue. I run to think of what she said Why it happened, what i did...  A piece of a poem from the other site... I didn't finish it and don't plan on writing anymore but it still has some good lines so I figured I'd transfer it.
