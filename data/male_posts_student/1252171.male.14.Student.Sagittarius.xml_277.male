Anyways, we meaning only I and other music students, got to miss school today, hooray for us!, and Darkblaze and SI had to stay back at school*mimes a tear* and Darkblaze was very mad, and sulky in the morning, but I shouldn't say why, or he'd probably threaten to kill me, and and and... yeah. Toodles! -Dilussional Child-
