I always stay home on the worst possible days. Anyway, I need to shower I'm considering calling Zach's cellphone and seeing if he'd like to meet somewhere for lunch after school since he has an early out. My dreams last night were bizarre, including a shopping trip for sweaters, jogging through Yorktown, training a little kid to be a killer, and Myanmar invading and conquering Korea. All of Korea. Whatever. It's like and epic. You'd have to be there. Recently I've been trying to think of and list all of the really wierd moments in my life that never really made sense. This is what I have so far: - My half sister chasing me through my house with a used condom filled with Walter's semen. - Being locked in El Corte Ingles in Madrid and finally finding an exit not realizing that it was the employee exit and then being accosted by a security man thinking I was stealing something. Too bad I don't speak spanish. - Declining to go to a party because I know there's going to be a man there who has good reason to kill me since I helped to put him in jail for six months. - Being found in a bathroom waving to myself for half an hour stoned out of my mind on shrooms. - Screaming at Leigh Anne that same night to stop shrinking.  I know there are plenty more that I can't think of at the moment so I will add to the list later.
