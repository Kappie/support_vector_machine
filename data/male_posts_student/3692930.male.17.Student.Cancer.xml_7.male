We go a little lost when looking for another guy cause Farias doesn't know the area that well.  While looking for the guy we asked someone for directions and ended up giving the guy a ride(I think he was an illegal) anyways we found him then went to the office and waited and finally left to PT.     We stretched then did some exercises and alternated between that and pull-ups(starting from one to 6 then down) .  After that we ran, and as always I got tired and was left behind.  When we finished we left to the office again, got weighed, then waited while Master Gunnery yelled at the Sargeants.  After a while we left and Sargeant Mojica took me and Hernandez home, I asked a lot of questions and found out that once I go to San Antonio to enlist I can wear a Marines t-shirt and he would hook me up with the ones at the office.  I got home ate  chicken and showered and eventually found myself to the computer to write this.    And about this weekend, I went both Saturday and Sunday to PT.  On Saturday alot of people went including a new guy which threw-up after running(I was just left behind) and on Sunday only me and Veltran went to PT with Sargeant Mojica(my recruiter).  I had to wear a white, plastic, trash-bag under my clothes to help me sweat and after a while I just took it off cause it was killing me.  He treated us with a Gatorade "Thirst Buster" from Circle-K and we went back to the office and got weighed.    I didn't sleep that Sunday until today at 11:00 am..........as a matter of fact I think I'll go to sleep now since it's 1:18 am....NIGHT
