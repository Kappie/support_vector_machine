I was originally stressed because I missed Friday and on many occasions it takes me atleast 2 days to get caught up, but that stress died away once I realized that my world history teacher, my math teacher, and my spanish teacher were also not at school and therefore couldn't lecture or give necessary notes.    As always, Biology was the most exciting period of the day.  Today we watched a video on Biodiversity so Shannon, Cliff, Becky, and I routinely hung out on the back wall ledge.  If I had one of the pieces of art to scan I would post it, but sadly I didn't come away with any of today's artwork.  Shannon was intrigued by the kangaroo rats on the video so she decided to transform Cliff into a kangaroo rat selling subs at Subway.  I'm not yet sure what birthed the idea into her mind, but today Shannon came up with what is now my word of the day. Fungina. Sexually related? I think not. Perv.  Lord of the Flies finally got interesting! *chomp chomp* *scratch sratch* BYE BYE SIMON!!    Model UN starts tomorrow and I'm a little nervous.  I think I'll know what to say going into it, but once I stand up I think there's a good chance the Delegation of Kenya will say something stupid.   Right after school I went to see about a parking permit for the last week of school after seniors leave because I'm cool like that and the lady rudely interrupted me saying that I needed to see Mr. Butler. She pointed out his office but I found out that he wasn't there, which the lady I'm sure already knew even before interrupted me.  Argh maybe tomorrow. Stupid office ladies.   After school there was a Thespian meeting and then since I didn't have a ride I decided to go chill out at Weis for bit.  I got some food, did a little Spanglish, and then went to the Autoport to apply for their position advertised in the paper. 10 minutes after I walk in the lady says "tell Mary to take the ad out of the newspaper". Could that mean I got the job already? NOPE. It means I reminded them that they didn't need the ad anymore. GAH. - the lady said she still would like to see my application in case one of the college kids doesn't work out. I also put one in at Weis just in case - Who knows.  I'll probably add something later, but for now happy June.  Peace   Chad
