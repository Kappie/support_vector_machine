The idea of eugenics is fairly simple: by eliminating problematic traits and genetic diseases from a gene pool, the health and standard of living will be improved for society as a whole. I agree with this, but only at the most basic, conceptual level (note: If I may, I would like to strip the word "eugenics" of all connotations for the remainder of this writing).    Note: I agree with eugenics because  homo sapiens  can no longer evolve as a species. The egalitarianism of the modern world has attempted to ensure that all, regardless of genetic makeup, have equal opportunities and an equal chance to survive. (For example, negative genetic mutations, such as those that cause poor eyesight, are no longer selected against, as eyeglasses make those with poor eyesight able to survive just as well as those with perfect eyesight.) I would like to stress that  This Is A Good Thing.  The reason I believe in egalitarianism is the same reason I disagree with most iterations of eugenics.    The many, many problems with eugenics arise from the execution. The Nazis took a brute-force approach, simply murdering those they deemed "undesirable." The genocidal campaigns of the Nazis barely fit under the definition of eugenics, as eugenics was used primarily as an excuse for psychopathic hatred and prejudice. Another, slightly less radical approach, is the sterilization of those with "bad genes." I obviously disagree with sterilization in that it's a clear-cut violation of reproductive rights (I hope I don't need to explain why I disagree with murder).   Despite all of this, a solution is on the horizon. Direct gene manipulation technologies will allow parents-to-be to eliminate genetic diseases and negative traits in their children. This is the only way I could possibly agree with eugenics (and really, then, due to all the negative associations the word has taken on, I'm not really a proponent of eugenics at all). Like most solutions, however, this one explodes into another firestorm of ethical questions. How do we prevent this technology from transforming the world into a Huxley-esque dystopia (also see: Gattaca)? Won't it further divide the rich and poor by making the rich more powerful  and  genetically superior to the poor? Insert fatuous worry about "playing God" here?  I raise many questions and provide few answers. For this, I apologize.      info.link:  urlLink http://www.googleguide.com/  how i died today:  urlLink beaten with sticks by the modern intellectual movement   [Listening to: Build Me Up Buttercup -  urlLink The Foundations  (02:58)]
