      I'm in a list-making mood, and there has been a lot of conversations I've been in about favorite movies, usually in the form of a top ten.  I have compiled my list.  I'm sure Glenn's list would be more Hip (capital H), and I'm sure I've broken some of the "rules."  And I'm sure I don't have enough "older" or "classic" movies.  So here goes.   Nick's Top Ten Movies    1.  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind    (I don't care if this movie is "new," I have never been as affected by any other movie in my life.  I was completely taken with this movie, and as stupid as it sounds, I have thought about something to do with this movie quite often since I saw it.  It's very possible that it's because of my own very recent personal life; besides the sci-fi memory erasing plot, the movie very closely parallels my own most recent and most serious romantic break-up.)     2.  urlLink Punch-Drunk Love    (Although I probably shouldn't admit this, I relate quite a bit to the Adam Sandler character in this movie.  I've managed to usually act pretty normal and even sometimes very confident and outgoing, but on the inside I've always been extremely awkward and insecure, and I'm usually one inch away from completely stumbling over myself.  Not really a comedy to me; more of a story about a very lonely, sensitive, and socially awkward guy who finds a girl who loves him not only despite his quirks, but maybe even because of them, and this love changes him, makes him stronger and able to finally stand up for himself.)   3.  urlLink Swingers     4.  urlLink Donnie Darko     5.  urlLink Roger Dodger     6.  urlLink The Odd Couple    (I don't know how many times I've seen this movie.  Doesn't really require any explanation.  I have more Oscar in me these days than I used to, but I'm probably leaning more towards Felix.)     7.  urlLink Magnolia    (I couldn't believe this movie when I first saw it.  Even though the movie is more than three hours long and is mostly all talk, I couldn't move for those three hours.  I love the characters in this movie.  I love the ideas of everything being connected, I love the ideas of retribution (except for the Philip Baker Hall character), I love the divine intervention (I knew nothing of this film or the "frog" scene before I saw it, so I was completely blown away).  After the movie was over, I felt a little bit different, like I'd been through something.  That's about the best thing a movie, and any art for that matter, could do.)   8.  urlLink Free Enterprise    When I first let Glenn borrow this movie a few years ago, after he saw it he said "only people like us would like this movie."  What he meant by "people like us," I'm guessing, is "nerds."  I have been a Star Trek fan since I was little (original series, motherfucker!), but as I've gotten older I'm not as into it.  But I do have a shameful amount of knowledge in my brain about the Star Trek universe, and other sci-fi and cult films.  I've had the very same conversations and arguments in real life that are in this film, and I've been in the same romantic situations (though mine never turned out very happily ever after in real life).  And William Shatner is hilarious.  This is basically Swingers for geeks.   9.  urlLink In the Company of Men     10.  urlLink Northfork    There you have it.  Most of these are "newer" movies, as in the past decade.  I can only guess what films are on Glenn's list.  2001?  Once Upon a Time in the West?  Howard the Duck?  Cool Runnings?
