I am so excited :D! 1day 15hrs 13mins 25secs till the concert.  Speaking of it, I finally got around to telling Katie that Ticketmaster upped the ticket prices 9 million dollars.   I'm not sure what else to say. My day went by pretty well. I went down to the pool, and played Megaman with Mike and Jason for an hour or so. Ehh, what else? Thunderstorm ripped through, and my mom found about about me disconnecting the mouse from her computer. Later I tried to get her to watch I love the 90s, but she didn't want to. Oh well they were talking about boners and Viagra for an hour anyway.  As of now I'm talking to Kristin :D! It's been awhile since we've had a good conversation.   mrunsensitive04: *BLOCK* Decembiebabie signed off at 7:43:12 PM.  Decembiebabie signed on at 7:43:22 PM.  mrunsensitive04: :-( Decembiebabie: that was sheer evil! mrunsensitive04: I can't go a whole 15 secs w/o talking to you Decembiebabie: yeah I know, for that split second I was, like, bored again mrunsensitive04: Tragedy. Decembiebabie: it was! I was about to turn green, tear my shirt off, and romp around my house breaking stuff b/c of that! mrunsensitive04: Oh :-( mrunsensitive04: You should get that checked Decembiebabie: yeah, maybe you're right... Decembiebabie: :-D  We're amusing ourselves. We're just that cool. Maybe I'll update with a little of Red Dress later.
