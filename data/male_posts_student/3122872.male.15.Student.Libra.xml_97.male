I won't even dignify dragontail/Jamie's comments with a response... that and the fact I can't think of one, (maybe I'll just wave my new graphics card in front of his face or something :D)   Yes... I went and changed the format... I was  that  bored... Cousin is starting to send me up the wall... and I will upload cute and cuddly pictures of the brat as soon as I get this uploading thing working... which could be sometime with this 56k connection... bah...   Just got the news that mum will be arriving sometime this month... :( my pseudo freedom is lost! Sooooo Bored...  Bleh...
