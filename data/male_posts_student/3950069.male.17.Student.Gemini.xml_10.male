You're all kinds of beautiful as you end my day    and you sweetly retire as the stars chase you away."        -The Spill Canvas: Sunsets and Car Crashes       I'll be brief about today. I've just taken a bath, and definitely feeling fresher than I was an hour earlier. School's tough. I'm trying so hard, to understand C programming. Gambatte!    I had thinking and problem solving lesson this morning, literally it set me thinking. Well, basically we were a little late for class since me, Jon and Irene plus Amy decided to wait for Mei Ling. As soon as we settled in class, Mr Ghazali was shooting off questions that we were supposed to answer 'Yes or No' to determine our thinking preference. I guess mine was a little accurate, even though I only believe its a method for us to get to know our own thinking preference and not decide whether you are someone who is creative or someone with no interpersonal skills. My results; I'm someone who uses my interpersonal skills quite a lot, and basically I am a very disorganised person since I don't have a very sequential thinking. After that comes my imagination which has the 2nd most hits, then analytical thinking.    After that, we were given very open-ended questions that sounded like, "What if everything in the universe doubled in size overnight?", "What if dogs were intelligent and we were their pets?". Well those were the questions my group was supposed to answer which we did, rather simply yet still raised a discussion. I had a lot to say earlier today, voicing my opinions on the perceptions other groups had regarding their own questions and I liked it. All along I liked having discussions, being a rather opinionated person myself. We had lunch, and then a half-hour Kuan KO lesson plus a rather boring lecture on C programming, why is Mr Chai monotone? He talks in such a soft voice, expects everyone to understand the words he speak yet he doesn't realise we're new to this module and for a start, we don't even know what to ask about. So when he goes, "any questions? can we move on?" everyone is quiet. Then my eyes start closing, but I still keep them open anyhow. Its a tough module though.    I was happy to see Amy in school today -grins- me and her have a lot to talk about, even though we didn't have much opportunities to talk about stuff today cuz we were in different classes. But still, while we were at the MRT station at Yio Chu Kang, we both got tickled so hard simply thinking about Xing when the three of us talked last nite. Basically, me and Amy spoke in a rather, English American slang which kinda confused Xing. It was all for fun Xing, but yup cut down on too much Singlish and English isn't that hard after all, even though I'm not that good myself.    Amy, I'm glad you seem that little bit chirpier today, you have a fantastic smile and good luck for your Dance audition! I'm looking forward to the results, because I do believe you'll make it, but even if you don't(considering 200 girls applied for like 20 slots) you're still a helluva dancer, right? I'm sure you wanna make a fool outta me, seeing you said this "I can dance for you, provided you'll dance with me." Oh my god, Amy you don't know how bad a dancer I am. I'd be so embarrassed.    I am thinking about Floorball and Photography, I do believe having 2 CCAs will take up too much of my time, because I still want my time to do other things. I have more interest in Photography, and basically it has grown to be a passion of mine and maybe one day, just maybe I'll be a good photographer. I'd like that very much.    Xiaowei (: baby, your presence in my life is amazing. I know you've been busy with school, and you're tired by the time school ends. But its okay really, that you don't have time to reply my smses so often, we still have time at night remember? -smiles- Tuesdays and my weekends are what I look forward to with so much eagerness, simply because that's when I have time to be with you. Even if its simply sending you home, or spending time talking about our own lives and problems, or even cuddling for a hug or two, its lovely. I've known you for such a long time, I feel like i've known you forever. But that's a good thing, because over the time I've known you and been with you, i've grown so much and i cherish our times so much more. You said I've been your silly lil' boy, I know I'm not lil' anymore, but by god,  I'd love to be your silly boy always.       If I had wings, you'd be the first I'd take to the skies.
