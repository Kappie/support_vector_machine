" and my all-time favourite, " Why can't they all be as good as the Ferraris? ".  This is a misconception of GINORMOUS proportions. Let's break this down a little. We'll start at "Qualifying times..."  Anybody ever notice how the difference between the guy who qualifies in 1st place and the guy who qualifies in last place, is around 3 to 5 seconds? That's not a helluva gap. (Okay, in F1 terms, that's a country mile...... but anyway)  At the end of a race, the gap between the guy who comes first and the guy who comes stone last, is around 1 to 1 and a half minutes. After a 60 to 70 lap race, that's not ALL that much, really.  The major thing to consider, is the fact that there are only 10 teams in F1. (The 10 'best' teams in the world). There are only 20 drivers in F1. (The 20 'best' drivers in the world). This has got to say something.........  For all those that want to mock and make fun of the teams/drivers that aren't doing too well, just sit back for a second and consider that these are the 'BEST' in the business. You think you can do any better, prove it.
