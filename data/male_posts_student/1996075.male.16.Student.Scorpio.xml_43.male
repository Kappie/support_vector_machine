GIRLS ONLY. yup. so sorry but you'll have to live without us for a few hours. yeah suddenly occurred to me that its the day after thanksgiving so there's going to be a mad rush for after thanksgiving sales at the mall but oh well. we'll survive. even easier to talk about people as they walk by without them even realizing it. one more day of school until thanksgiving break...yay. lots of fun. french teacher isn't here today so yeah pretty much doing nothing. its exciting.   rar ~Christy
