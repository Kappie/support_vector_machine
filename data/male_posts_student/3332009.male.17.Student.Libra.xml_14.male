I am too choosy I guess or maybe girls are blind. Neither am I ugly nor handsome. Why is it that girls dont seem to take interest in me? Currently I like this gal(FEL) at NYP(SIT) very much. I knew she was the one ever since my eyes got lost into her.  But I know she do not take particular interest in me. She might think I am some good for nothing tallie loser. My whole world seems to have changed. I am not the Sanjeev I used to be. Oh God, Whats the hell is happening to me? It is like everything I do, I will think about her. Even now while blogging I think about her. She has been like part of me. The first thing I think when I first wake up is her and the last thing I think is her. Whenever, I play soccer I also think about her. I am in love.   Deep down inside me , I will always love you.
