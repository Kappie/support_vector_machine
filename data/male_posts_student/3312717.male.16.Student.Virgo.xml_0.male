If people tried real hard to find the real me, the me behind the mask, then you would know.  It's a forgive and forget world, with a little regret and revenge mixed in.  You can't hold a grudge against everyone who does something to you anyway.  Otherwise I'd end up sending a lot of people mail with anthrax in it or something.    There are two reasons that I do weird things: 1) It's just who I am and 2) it makes me stand out.  If I wasn't just a little weird I'd be an average boring kid who gets good grades and isn't cared about, otherwise a John.    You guys don't even really know how weird I am either.  Ever since I moved here in 6th grade I've been keeping mostly to myself.  I was, and still am, a shy kid who doesn't really speak out much.  I started as a prickly cactus, but now I'm like an unblossomed tulip.  I'm approachable but not open.  My weirdness now is like long lake compared to lake superior.  Get what I mean?  Memorial weekend sucked. Rain. Cold. Still no car yet. Drivers test in 2 weeks or so. Phone #: 829-3791
