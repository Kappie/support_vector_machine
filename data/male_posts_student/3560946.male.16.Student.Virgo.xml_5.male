The forums designed by Panevi, our current Vice-President, were not working.  That was why I invited people to try this web log instead.  Now it is becoming clear that the web log is not working either.  I am now looking for alternative solutions.  It has been brought to my atention that finding such solution is considered to be entirely within my mandate as the President.  I disagree.  It needs to be within all of our mandates as citizens.  I need suggestions.  If we are looking for another forum server, we already know that Proboards have fairly decent forums servers.  The Republic of West Overbrook Proboard server we used temporarily seems to work for users, as does the International Association Proboard server.  Would Lavalon citizens consider moving once again? (I know this blows, but obviously we've got to fix this problem, and it's affecting the progress of Lavalon, so time is of the essence.)  Let me know here, and we'll move from this blog to some new location.  Help me fix this problem and it will get fixed.  Zachary Klaas President of Lavalon
