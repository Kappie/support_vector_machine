Some men are pansies and don't swear, but for the most part, all guys have a sailor-spirit in them. When you're around women, keep the profanity in your head and the compliments flowing from your mouth. Of course, the obvious exception to this is if the female company you keep doesn't mind a little bad word here and there...especially if it excites them! (wink wink). ;-)
