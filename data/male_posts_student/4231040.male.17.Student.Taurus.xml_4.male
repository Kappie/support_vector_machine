And skin, pale like December’s moonlight, blending constantly with shadows from the trees overhead.        With her hair, an infinite midnight waterfall, slowly dancing with the breeze as she ambled leisurely on the avenue.        And her face, sweetly sinister as it steals away the essence of beauty itself        With eyes, shrouded in mist though still revealing a hazel stare that murders me.        And lips, pursed quietly, hesitantly killing the roses behind which already pales in contest.        And now there she goes, The god of my idolatry Mocking Cleopatra’s beauty The silent muse of inspiring fantasy.
