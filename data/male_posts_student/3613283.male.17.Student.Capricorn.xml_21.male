"Our most fatal mistake was in the failure to understand that  liberation means liberation .  Iraqis were thrilled to be rid of Saddam Hussein, and rightly so.   No one should denigrate the enormous accomplishment of our troops , nor the relief felt by the Iraqi people that they could live in freedom.  But Iraqis who had lived for decades under a ruthless tyrant did not want him removed in order to be governed by foreigners."  "America has done an incredible service for the Iraqi people.  It is important to remind people that we did a great and a noble thing, and to understand that if we continue doing the right thing for the people of Iraq, they will be grateful, and will build a country that will be an invaluable ally."  Yes,  it was right , but  mistakes were made  according to Danielle Pletka who is the vice president for Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute.  To those who today have the nerve to say that America's war was illegal, don't come in ten years telling us how great it is to make business with Iraq, the new free society within the Mideast. Because it will happen.   urlLink AEI: Core Mistakes in Iraq
