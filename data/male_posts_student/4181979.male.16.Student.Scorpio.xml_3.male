Have been sitting in front of the book the whole day...doing anything and everything except the syllabus chapters!  Anyway,We had planned to go to PVR Saket,(me,saurabh and ilaksh)...and we were almost going when maasi had this WONDERFUL idea and called up at the last moment that its not safe coz of AUG 15(duh!!)...bleh  So i got really pissed off.... i didn't even watch yesterday's hungarian GP....  bleh!  And so it happenned that when i had decided to get a movie for rent,then Dad came up with the wonderful idea that we should go to the garden of 5 senses.Bleh!...i mean everything was happenning me against the movies.  Anyway,so we went to the garden of 5 sense,with myself being double pissed off.....fine place but nothing tooo great!  Anyway,so came back and had idli vadas which maasi had sent on the previous day..  And then i tried to study some english but went off to sleep.! So that was it... Bleh and chao!
