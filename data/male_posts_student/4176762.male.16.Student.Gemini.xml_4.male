I bet you can guess how this turned out, thanks to my convenient title.  Yeah, for the second time I failed my driver’s test.  What a boost in self-confidence when you can’t pass a test that Billy-Bob, who is picking his ass in between questions, aces.  God, it sucks.  I mean, I wasn’t up for the whole wait three hours in line thing, I even knew I wasn’t going to pass, so what ends up happening?  I don’t pass.  Boy is my mom pissed.  She can’t stop mumbling under her breath about it, “my son has a genius IQ, made a 30 on his ACT, AND CAN’T PASS THE FUCKING DRIVER’S TEST”.   Sorry for the language, but this day has sucked total balls.  When my mom gets back to the car, we still have to go to the Apple store, iPod is broken, then to Office Max for school supplies.  There’s another thing that sucks, school starts tomorrow.  Okay, I’ve taken my six quizzes, written my two poems….and haven’t even started my two essays and two papers.  I’m really not linking myself today.  Sure some can say its my fault for not passing the test.  “Philip, the only time you studied was today!”  While that may be true, it doesn’t matter.  I’m taking the test next week and the week after and after.  Im going to pass that test UNDER ten tries.   A soulution:  well, my mom has said that she is sending me to driver’s ed.  I may be wrong, but don’t you need at least a permit for driver’s ed.  All the people who I know that took the course all had their permits.  Now for this to work, it would mean no TKDo, like ever, b/c my mom would have to drive me to driver’s ed.  This is simply unacceptable.  TKDo is the only thing that keeps me alive, that keeps me going, if I didn’t have it then I could stop my existence or move to Nashville, both of which I don’t want to do.  See?  I told you things would get interesting, even if you may think I am a pathetic being.  Well, I got a lot of things to think about and even more papers than that to write, so I shall take my leave. Until next time.
