Once again the computer lady demonstrated her incompetence in her field of "specialty" being computers and in result, we were forced to turn to Macbeth instead of watching another group's pathetic movie(ours was amazing). However, we did have a nice argument regarding heroes. From the way we argued, one might think that Ben and I actually gave a shit. The rest of the day was normal, meaning it sucked. Naturally there were some funny moments, like when Ben decided to yell, "mononucleosis," resulting in me spitting my drink all over his tray. Now I need your help on this next enigma. Who is more stupid? Connor? or Caitlyn? Our conslusion was that Connor is actually smarter, which is quite astonishing. What ever happened to Connor? He used to be a smart kid. Its amazing how much someone can change in a span of about 2 years. For those of you not from Franklin, who dont understand what makes it so terrible, heres an example. Alissa was sent home today becuase her "shirt was too short." WHAT THE FUCK?!?! So what, a little bit of her stomach might be showing. I dont think anyone is going to be harmed or offended by that in anyway. I didnt get to see her at all because she had to be sent home! :-( Mr. Stubey honestly must be gay. Why would a straight person develop a dress code like the one we currently have? One last thing before I stop. I hate riding. I never really liked it, but Ive been able to put up with it for the past 11 years. Now its gotten to the point i cant stand it. Thankfully my horse is being sold and the other one is getting bred. Finally. Thats it for today, Im out
