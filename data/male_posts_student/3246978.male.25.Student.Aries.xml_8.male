Other telecom players may not be willing to shift to "Bill and Keep system" but once Reliance is out with this scheme - sooner or later they will have to.  Start charging Rs. 1000 per month (or higher if Reliance network is not prepared to handle sudden surge in number of connections) and bring it down to around Rs. 500 once "bill and keep system"is accepted and network is prepared. Offer one time amnestry scheme to defaulters by giving them oppurtunity to shift to this scheme. At the same time offer customers option of shifting to better scheme if offered in future.  This will help Reliance avoid BILLING which has become a major headache. It will also help in eliminating bad debts, and reduce customer complaints substantially.
