So this is my "sicknasty" Tuesday. We go to East Hamptons. I go to this library. I notice a sign on the window that says "Hello, I'm James, please don't tap on me, thank you." And on the window was a fly. So I assumed the fly was James (and not the window) and started tapping on the window attempting to get James to come outside. Why did I not say trying and say attempting, am I trying to act smart, though attempting is a 2nd grade vocabulary word. ANYWAYS, I started tapping and then the lady was like CUT THAT OUT, I could see her through the window so I went inside and told her that James was misbehaving. Then we bought tickets to The Terminal at the movie theater. The craziest thing happened. My cousin Kate and Britt are about to receive their food that they payed for when the cops dart in the place saying everyone get out of the theater. This theater was a two floor theaterand our movie was on top floor so I wason the steps on the way up when the cops came in. "HEY KID GET DOWN HERE."- Cop...."SCREW YOU!!!" - me. hehe. I ran upquickly andcalmly said"Everybody evacuate the theater." My dad knew the voice and immedietly told my Aunt to stay, that's my son."JAMIE JAMIE WHERE ARE YOU?! JAMIE!!!! HAVE YOU SEEN MY SON!?!? YOU BASTARD PIGS, GET OUT OF MY WAY I NEED TO GET MY SON!.....JAMIE THERE YOU ARE!!!*SLAPPED!*"and now everyone is waiting outside the theater wondering whatin the hell is going on.Some coptold us theroof was caving in because of the bad storm that day and we got our tickets back but that wasn't the endof it. Remember I said my cousins were about to receive theirfood, well we didn't and Imade the cops get the girl that worked theregister to give us back$25...little did they know that theyhanded offthe drinks and the Starburstsand really all they owed us was $10for popcorn. So out of all this deboggle, came a profit. Hurray. So we thoughtthat was all the bad luck for the day when suddenly we gotlost and ended up on GAY ROAD!!!! Ok, there couldn't be anymore. To make ourselves happy I'ddo theOstridge walk Kevin M taught me a long time ago and that madeeveryone crack up andhappy andforget about the bad luck.So we go to Luigi's, some random second class restaurant and turns outthere's nomore room and the lady was a bitch about it, and aHUGE BITCHI might add.We go to Luigi's every year and this was the first year thatwe couldn't get a table. So we go tothisplace called Oyster Pond where a hugeflood in the road existed which I called Oyster Pond and I decided to jump in it. Then when we were seated,dust started falling all over our table from thevents above.This daywas truely the most bad luckday I have ever experienced. So the day ends and the rest of thevacation was great with great weather. I got lots of color.John the Jamaican at thepool at WaveCrest which is where we stay was keeping cool like usual, hard to understand his heavy accent. And he laughs so jollyful. Thursday was good,the Troianos (more cousins of mine) came outwith Danny and Chris the boys kickin up some beach fun. What the hell am I talking about. WellDannydidn't go in the water, that was deppressing but the day still kicked ass. DidImention I got really tan. Wow, I'm looking over all the things that happened last Montauk and it makes this Montauk look like shit.Go read it, it's July 19th, 2003. Saw alot ofhot girls but didn't bother, I was too lazy.Saturday I came home and theupstairs floor wasredone and now we're not getting a railing for another 5 months so we have to have this lethal dresser that prevents peooplefrom falling off the steps, but if someone pushes that offon someone, they'd probably die. Ok well today I drummed from 12:30 to 8:30 and I think that's 9 hours. Yea, I'm a loser. Shoot me. Iwant Paul and Matt to comehome, I guarantee they're both bored out of they're minds, what the hell is there that's good in Vermont. Ok that's all. Bye.
