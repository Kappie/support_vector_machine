As we all know, religion online has become an enormous industry, reaching millions of people worldwide and providing many with a promise of hope and understanding through their religious teachings.  Hate sites work in the same way.  As seen in Hate.com, many of those who practice hate consider this hate to be based in religious ideology.  I am sure you will remember the young lady from the video who was describing the lettering tattooed on her arm and explaining the idea behind RAHOWA, RAcial HOly WAr.  In her mind, as she was indoctrinated to believe this way, she is religiously bound to practice hate.  This is her religious identity.  Hate sites plant this message of religious identity with the user and lure the user in with the idea that they too can find salvation and belonging within a particular group.  This group will support them through hard times and help them to understand the difficulties they face in their everyday lives. However, there is a little twist to the teachings, as the  "understanding"  provided by hate groups is not your traditional message of love and forgiveness. Instead, these hate groups present the message that you have to subjugate others in order to obtain righteousness.
