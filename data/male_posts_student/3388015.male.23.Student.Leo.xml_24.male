Evidently, the angry, "punky" Canadian, Avril Lavigne, has attributed her embittered and hateful lyrics to her consumption of too many carbohydrates. (I attribute her bad lyrics to lack of insight, life experience, and oh, talent. But what do I know? I'm not a music snob.) Miss Lavigne has found peace in her new organic, low-carb diet. We can only look forward to a lighter, more effervescent, brand of dribble - as opposed to her customary morose, yet pointless, dribble.  Back to the lactose. Available for your misguided consumption, American Dairy Farmers introduce Low-Carb Milk! Now you can enjoy your milk with slightly less guilt. However, Luke astutely pointed out that the carbohydrates in milk come from lactose, and lactose-free milk has been available for quite some time.   Luke: People can just drink lactose-free milk! Cindy: Or don't drink milk at all, like me. But I don't drink it because I can't afford it. Luke: And some people don't drink milk because it leads to more risky behavior.  Thank you, Luke, for making fun of my weakness, poverty, and penchant for dairy.  Today, both Luke and ChrisSinclair helped me move from the basement of Crosby to Burton 3, which is actually Burton 4, but seems like 5. Whatever. The point is that we all went to eat and I didn't pay BECAUSE I'M A BIG FUCKING LOSER WHO HASN'T PAID FOR A MEAL IN THREE YEARS! The shame goes away after the first year - it really does. I almost wear it like a badge. My new room is great. It's four flights up, very very hot with one window, and much much smaller than my old room. Yep, I got it made. I stood up from kissing my rats and banged my head on the ceiling. Now I know what Luke feels like.   LukeyLuke and I mosied on over to the Mecca of Rochester (Walmart) to pick up my pictures of Benny. Three roles of film dedicated to someone who never cared about me. Hey, I look great. Sheila looks great and Luke looks great which is the most important thing. Remember kids, personalities fade but good looks are forever.  We jet to Luke Osborne's house where Laura and I make fun of Luke Fischer's extremely bad memory. His feelings were hurt, but I doubt that he even remembers any of it by now. Not that we cared. hee hee. In the car, we decided that Laura likes to boil babies in a tub and make them into soap.   I am currently blogging at ChrisSinclair's apartment. ChrisSinclair (one word) - he's more hair than funny. He's the only person in the world who doesn't laugh at Luke's jokes. He lacks the gene which enables people to appreciate the absurd.  Luke, when are we going to start losing weight again? Damn you and your job! Your employment status is making me fat!  Sheila: What business does a hispanic girl have going tanning? Why does Cindy go tanning??? Luke: To make her teeth look whiter.   Luke: Thanks for making me laugh before bed. Me: Thanks for making me fat.  Good night, Luke. May you have sweet nerdy dreams about your creepy caucasian aliens. Zzzzzz
