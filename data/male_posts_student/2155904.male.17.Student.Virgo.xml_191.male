Tyke saw the music video to that before leaving for the AP test this morning as well as hearing it in 5th period today.  And now after the bath Tyke took a little while ago his mind reverted back to the last time he thought about a bath and that was watching Brit take one.  Well, now that that is out of the way, back to the day's events.  One more thing though.  Apparently there is some dissension between the quality of the blogs the past few weeks.  Tyke feels they are pretty good and Kinker agrees.  But today Amed voiced his opinion for the opposite.  So now Tyke doesn't know what to think.  Well, either way Tyke is going to keep writing them the same way he has been for the past couple of weeks.  And don't forget that you won't be immersed in Tyke's life from Tuesday to Friday of next week.  For that is when Tyke will be gone to Ashland, Oregon.  Ashland, apparently the pot-smoking capital of the Northwest.  Perfect place for Tyke of course, sarcasm for those of you who don't actually know Tyke personally which is at least one person.  The AP test was today.  The multiple choice was harder than Tyke was expecting/used to but the essays were fine.  Tyke got bored and drew all over his essay questions booklet.  He put Oscar the Grouch in the trash can and had Nader and the other lady crying.  And some other things as well.  Hopefully Sanders will like that.  After the AP test was over they realized they had 2 hours until they had to be back at school.  So Purdy drove her, Dotti, Tyke, Dr. Phil, and Amed to Dick's in Seattle.  And by the way, Amed's story about how Sanders mentioned loving dicks and how he should have brought her back some while smiling the whole time is just sickening.  Just so gross.  Seriously.  Ewww.  But Dick's was fun.  And cheap.  On the way back Amed didn't come with them so the car ride was less crowded and still fun.  They even listened to Christian songs cuz there was no more "basher" in the car.  Tyke got dropped back off at the Admin building and drove up by Kinker's house cuz they were playing poker for their lunch at his house and ordering pizza apparently but they weren't there.  So then Tyke went to school and got to class only a little late.  But he still took a nice long break and talked to Tina for a few minutes and then talked to Skippy about prom as well as Piggy J.  Hopefully he now knows who he is asking to prom.  That would make things easier.  But nonetheless prom was discussed.  And then Physics was easy cuz all they did was play music with odd things.  And no hw tonight makes things a lot nicer.  After school Tyke went to sorta work on the teacher impersonations for the senior assembly and then he came home to change and grab a bite to eat.  He then went down to South Cove to play ball with Doc P, Macaroon, Jew, Amed, etc.  Man, Tyke can apparently get on some people's nerves.  At least the big boy's nerves he got on.  But he's stupid anyway so it doesn't matter.  Not that Tyke would fight but he could take him.  He's all jiggly and slow.  Annnnyway, then Tyke, Doc P, and Macaroon went to Mickey D's for dinner.  They stayed there for a while and talked about quite a few things.  It was different than Tyke thought it would be.  It was just fun.  Then Tyke came home and took a bath which is what he started tonight with and now that he has come full circle, he can finish this blog off with.
