If you guys have any queries about your drill knowledge or some other NPCC related stuffs, and finds an immediate need to rectify the query.  Do not hesitate to find me in school. SMS me or whatever. By the way, i've now stood down as your NCO. So you are not obliged to show me as much respect as before(basic individual discipline is still required...)  So just treat me as just another friend who is two years senior. I'll be glad to answer any questions you ask, if my memory can heed my wish.  Other than NPCC stuffs, any school work you need help with. You may get to me too. I need pratising on my lower secondary work too... so its a win-win situation if tt happens.  In the meantime, good luck everyone. In your CCA as well as your academic inclinations...
