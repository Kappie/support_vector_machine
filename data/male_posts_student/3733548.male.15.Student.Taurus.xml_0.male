Ive done it now, and now I'm not biased to it now. well, I'm in Knoxville now and its great, we got here the day beforeyesterday, and its been great, we walked around town night before last and then we went to this uber cool bookstore last night, tonight I dont know what we're doing, but I strongly believe that Adam can increase the "fun factor" of the night, he's been able to each night. well, Ive got to go now, Ill be posting more often now. talk to you later
