I actually might think about checking out this concert as well.  I took a walk tonight at around 10, I havent taken a walk at night in awhile.  I listened to my Ben Folds CD cause I havent listened to it in awhile.  It was pretty dark, but for some reason I am not scared even though I am surroned by woods, I am just so familiar with the place I feel fine.  It also might be that whole "invincibility" feeling you get as a teenager.  Maybe one of these days it will catch up with me and I will be killed by some psycho on one of my walks.  But until then I will keep enjoying them.  I didnt accomplish anything I wanted to do this weekend.  I didnt see The Day After Tomorrow, practice with Marty, go fishing with my dad (he never called), or do some filming with Nick and the others.  I slept alot, and Kate hasnt called yet from her cottage, I guess she must not be getting a reception, I know I couldnt at my cottage, and she doesnt have a phone at the cottage either.  Well, at least she gets home tomorrow.  Tomorrow I will have to get started on alot of homework.  My birthday is closing in, and I am not really sure what I want.  My mom is thinking of a TV for my room, that would be nice.  I think what I really want is to start being happy with my life this summer, just have some fun this summer.  Work on the band, maybe record, go to concerts, spend time with friends, go to the spree, spend time with Kate and just try to truly be happy again.  Maybe I can start eating healthier too and working out, I heard exercise helps people with stress.  Eh, I always say that I will start eating healthier and working out, but I never seem to do it...maybe I will have enough free time this summer, and really get determined.  That would be nice, and I would feel better about myself.  Well, I am gonna go for now, I will see you later whoever reads this.  "In this life, you have been, broken down" -Mike Felumlee
