And sorry, Melody, for mentioning you and therefore ruining your reputation (as an uncool person, by being associated with such a cool person).  That's just the way the song is sung.  Speaking of songs, notice the new song, "You Don't Know My Name" by Alicia Keys.  It fit my situation so well like two weeks ago.  Too bad it doesn't fit anymore.  This was changed based on Jing's counsel, tell me if you want me to change it back to one of those teen angst songs.  I was feeling immoral, having stolen Loren's song, so I felt I had to change it.  Speaking of immorality, I took John's hell test and got into Limbo, as a "Virtuous Unbeliever."  I don't know how much value I should place on this because 1) Christianity is such a load of BS and 2) Loren also got into Limbo.  Now Melody's going to try to convert me, she's such a shicksa and I heard that she was trying to "save" Kevin a while ago.  Speaking of Melody, there was some funny stuff said in a convo between John and me today that included her.  This inclusion was when I was sending John an mp3 and he was saying it was so slow, and I was like "but at least it's constant... unlike Melody."  JK.  He didn't get it, though.  Another good quote taken out of context is me saying "I love ankle porn."  You can judge for yo'self.  Speaking of ebonics (and ergo, race), I really think there ought to be a White Culture Club.  If there can be an Asian Culture Club and a Jewish Culture Club and a Black Leadership Council, the list goes on, why can't white people have a place to meet and celebrate their civilization's achievements?  Such clubs shouldn't just be for minorities; Asians are the most plentiful people in the world.  You might counter (as John did), we already have Presidents' Day and Veterans' Day and Columbus Day, etc., so why do we need more?  Well, those are not white holidays.  Those are AMERICAN holidays, and whites and blacks and Asians and Jews in this school are all Americans.  Speaking of political correctness, I am so sick of feminism.  I don't care who hears me, I'm going to say "sportsmanship" and "actress" and "chairman" now and forever.  The "actress" one really gets me, it's like they need to masculate themselves by using the masculine form, lowering the female gender for everybody.  Speaking again of political correctness or lack thereof, here's a politically incorrect quote from an episode of The OC to end things:  Seth: Yeah, well, I'm sure everyone will be so accepting seeing as how we're such a liberal, tolerant bunch.  And that was at the expense of Orange County, not Luke's dad.  Who's a big, gay dad.
