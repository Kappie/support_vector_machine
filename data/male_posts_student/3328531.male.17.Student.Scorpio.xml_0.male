To make matters worse, instead of being able to acknowledge this lack of intelligence, we defend it and simply brush the issue off by saying, "It's just entertainment!". Havven't we gotten fed up with simply being entertainers? Why don't we start to function in other facets of society? I guess that all of this is starting to come to mind afetr experiencing the aimless bickering of some black students today. They were arguing over "gear" and who had the most! The conversation was stupid, so instead of butting in and correcting the idiots, i decided to stay on the outside and adopt a new sense of simply observing life. the conversation translates as follows:  PERSON A: I have a lot more cheaply made cotton than you because my parent (note the absence of the plural form of parent and the absense of Person A's job being mentioned)has more money than you parent!  PERSON B: What do you mean? My mother has lot's of money that she gives to me to buy clothes with. i never elect to spen the money on more valuable purposes liek college application fees or books taht have intellectual value. Instead, I enjoy pouring my money out of the community into the hands of the same group of people that my ancestors picked these fabrics for!  PERSON A: Be quiet, your arguement is starting to sound almost as good as mine so now I feel the need to call you a name in a latent act of psychological projection. I feel depressed and sad with my inner self as well as my surroundings (family, neighborhood, etc), so I am going to lash out on you by calling you a homosexual!     im bored now, sleep awaits me, sorry!
