In  urlLink his interview in this week's TIME Magazine , he says he supported - and still supports - the war in Iraq. Sure, he would have liked to have let Hans Blix finish his inspections. That doesn't obscure the fact there were no WMD. Clinton pretty much commits a milder version of the crime that the Bush administration has been committing ever since 9/11 - conflating Al-Qaeda and the war on terror with the war in Iraq. No Mr. Clinton, there were no truly significant connections between Iraq and Al-Qaeda; no Mr. Clinton, Iraq did not have significant WMD to give to terrorists.   Even more disgusting is Clinton's identification with neo-con imperialism. He says, "Well, first of all, I think we needed a little missionary zeal after 9/11." Great, so from that quote it appears as though he also believes that it is America's role to go reshaping the whole world through military operations.  Throughout Bush's presidency progressives have looked back on the halcyon Clinton years drooling with nostalgia. Let's get a little perspective. Instead of Bush's ruthless bullying, with Clinton, we would have had something that could have been called "compassionate aggression."  What a choice!
