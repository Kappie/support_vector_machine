You couldn't see details of the men's faces, but just the rough outlines of their heads tilted in the direction of the party boss, who was standing on a platform in the shade raffling off washing machines to supporters of Francisco Labastida, the ultimate candidate of the PRI, the Institutional Party of the Revolution.  The photo was a quintessential example of something that is emblematic of Mexico, and emblematic of the lugubrious beauty of the Yucatan (its sky blue waters, its limestone, its caste wars and its fevers), with nostalgic mustaches, guayaberas, and white straw hats.         The genocide charges against Luis Echeverria were easily thrown out.  According to the court, the expiration of the statute of limitations on genocide is dispositive.         Yet the honorable judge who dismissed the writ against Echeverria must not, in my opinion, have thought that Echeverria was guilty of ordering the killings of students in the 1970's.  Otherwise, I think, he would surely have found a way to hold him accountable.  I am convinced.         What well-educated man of laws, and what student of the Mexican Revolution and its Constitution ( la ley de amparo , which another judge taught us when we were in Guanajuato), could in good conscience permit the architect of a dirty war to escape trial?  Didn't the Mexican Revolution gave birth to more than corruption and dirty war?   Surely it must also have created good men.    ( Was there a bribe, jaundiced, disillusioned, or venal, paid by somebody to somebody else. )       Yet at least Mexico today is not the dictatorship of the days of the titans.  Four years ago, Mexicans rejected Labastida and voted for Vicente Fox Quesada.  This was a monumental breakthrough in the history of the Republic, as so many noted at the time and have emphasized since.  Like the Taiwanese did to the Kuomintang with Chen Shui-bian, the Mexicans somewhat calmly ushered out their old rulers, and anointed the opposition in a manner that was not very vengeful -- and without dismantling the institutional party in the manner of the East Europeans and Russians, who smashed statues of Lenin and Felix Dzerzhinsky in 1991 outside of the headquarters of the KGB.       The new ruler that Mexico chose was not, despite the usual hopes and the usual promises that are directed at the mestizos and the Indians, a messiah in the Brazilian style, like Getulio Vargas or Janio Quadros or Jo√£o Goulart.   Also, there was no climactic euphoria, no tears were be wiped from their eyes, and there was no olive green ( verde olivo ) .   Instead, the new president projected and projects an image of competence, business acumen -- all the attributes of the North American company that he worked for -- and integrity.         I should say that there is no doubt in my mind that Fox is an honest man.  But Mexico is still waiting and ill at ease, and most of the country is no longer (Juan O'Gorman, we must say it!) in the shadow of Something that has become irrelevant (the inheritance of dreamers and of losers).                   The New York Times ran an editorial today on the dismissal of charges against Mexico's ex-President Luis Echeverria.
