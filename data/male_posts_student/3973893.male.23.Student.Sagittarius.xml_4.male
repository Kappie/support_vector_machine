We all sang Wonderboy by  urlLink The D , then Evan and I sang a duet - Under Pressure by Bowie and Queen, which was hilarious because I hadn’t listened to that song in a while, still pretty fun though. Then I sang Tina Turner’s version of Proud Mary with Evan backing me up – I even did the dance that goes with the song.   Brandon   showed up at the beginning of Proud Mary and was glad he didn’t miss it. It was something to be seen. Of course I was feeling pretty good then so I’m sure the alcohol helped. Besides that we just played pool and drank. Towards the end of the night Evan suggested oat sodas, so we drank those, feeling deliciously white trash.     We left around Midnight, giving John and Brandon a ride home, or so we thought… my car broke down on   Franklin   and I was able to coast it into the parking lot of a Best Western. I couldn’t get it started so I left it there over night (after talking with the front desk guy, who was a jerk) and finally had it towed around Noon today and brought to the Honda Dealer to get fixed. I think it’s either the carburetor or the fuel pump, since it was acting like I was out of gas when, in fact, I had gas. Either way it will be less than $200 to fix it, so that’ good news considering it could have been a lot more.
