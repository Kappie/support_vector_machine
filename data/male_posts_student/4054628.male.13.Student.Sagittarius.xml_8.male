My last post suggested that you all tell me something about your favourite character in the book.  I'm looking forward to hearing what you all think.  Secondly, You may have noticed that some posts have been removed from the blog.  These were posts I considered irrelevant or not detailed enough.  If you have a criticism of the Hobbit (for example, if you thought it was crap!) make sure you give me reasons.  Whenever you talk about a text it is important to back up your points with evidence.  Every opinion is valid as long as you can back it up!   IMPORTANT     Make sure when you are writing a post you use full sentences with proper punctuation.  This is not a "chat" room, but a place where I want you to write your ideas formally for the class to read and respond to.  So let's get posting!
