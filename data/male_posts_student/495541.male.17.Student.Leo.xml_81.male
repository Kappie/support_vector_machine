That’s the kind of things that are great to look back on.  While I’m happy about today tomorrow, I fear, will be the complete opposite.  Tonight, I went and saw  The Ring .  It was a scary movie, I must say.  I think mostly because it was weird.  There were so many things to link together it didn’t make much sense but thankfully my good friends who had already seen it explained it to me and all was well.  I had a great time and had quite a bit of fun.  If you didn’t come along, you missed out!  Monday begins the break and I’m happy for that.  The only downside is I still have basketball.  If I could pause that for a week, I would.  My life has been so complicated and frustrating for the last few months.  It even hurts to think about it – so I won’t.  Good night.
