Anyway, it's occured that the few times that women have got physically close to me (grand total of 3 people, Becky, Beccay, and Sam) that the most common action they've done is the single finger vertically pressed against my lips. In fact, it's not simply these 3 special people who have done this - other people have done the same action. I think it's because I tell jokes such as the one below.  Anyway, I'm quite happy today, I've got a lot of mobile numbers off people, and despite feeling a bit of a slut that almost all of them are women I'm happy to have got the ability to contact them.  Quote of the day: "I wanna hold you, But my hands are tied. I wanna stay here, But I've been denied. Let's watch the clock Until the morning sun does rise."
