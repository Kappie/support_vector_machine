What's going on with everyone, including myself? Everyone's changed.  It's probably the end of the school year that's doing it to everyone. It'll pass I think.   Anyways, shit's still goin good, weather's nice, and I'm gettin ready for summer vacation by prepping my summer sleep schedule.   Sleep: 4am Wake up: 10am-1pm ish  Damn right I'm a lazy bastard.
