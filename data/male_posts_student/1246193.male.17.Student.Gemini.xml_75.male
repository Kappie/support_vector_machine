Needless to say, I am in the mood for diving.  His songs remind me of those warm, summer days spent in the Florida Keys.  Nothing to do but don some scuba gear and head toward the reefs.  It has been just under a year since I have been diving and with warm days upon us I am longing for the open ocean.  Diving is such an incredibly unique experience; it is almost indescribable.  One of the few activities that can both get your blood pumping and totally relax you at the same time.  Just imagine...you are completely weightless-able to move in any manner you want, you can't hear anything but the calming sounds of the ocean-a dull whisper, surrounded by the most fascinating life, and most of all you are breathing underwater. I want, no, I need to dive and be immersed in another world right here on planet Earth.     "From birth, man carries the weight of gravity on his shoulders.  He is bolted to earth.  But man has only to sink beneath the surface and he is free." ---Jacques Cousteau
