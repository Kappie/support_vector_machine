Now approximately 40% finished with my reading for my history of coffee class!  0% reading done for my Depression culture class, and work done on my mass communications and stats classes.  That's a lot of crap I need to get done in the next few days.  In rotation "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" (1892) by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky.  I'm off to bed now.  ***
