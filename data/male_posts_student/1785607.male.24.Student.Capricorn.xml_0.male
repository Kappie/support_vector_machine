As night passed I realized that I'm in this place alone, though all my friends were alone and that I was getting attention  (in the total sweet and innocent sense of the word)  from a girl-friend. It just seems that when I'm in a group the sense of loneliness gets so much hard to endure. That and my big secrets!  So it all comes to the moment that I just can't handle all this pressure... I'll explode but it scares me... the reaction, the sense of lost that I'll be having  (because it will happen)   I just wish it all could be a little easier and have a friend approaching me and telling me: "I know" ... It'll lift all the woes and worries... and I could be a lot free... 'cause as I once heard:  "the soul suffers"  .... You have no idea how that is true...!!!
