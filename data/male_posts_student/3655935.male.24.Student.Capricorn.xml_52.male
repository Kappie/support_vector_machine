Amen.  These verses have always been a powerful reminder of the nature of God.   It begins with describing God as one who guards ( phulasso ) us from stumbling--emphasizing his love and concern for us.  This is ultimately demonstrated by making it possible for us to be in his presence and experience great joy (not condemnation).  How can we stand before God and rejoice?  Jesus makes us blameless ( amomos =the LXX uses this as the same word for a sacrifice before God) through his death on the cross.  We don't earn this status.  God graciously grants it.  The doxology continues to describe God's nature.  First, God alone is God.  Nothing else has the status of being God, which is one reason why we worship him.  God alone is worthy of worship because only God is God.  God has  glory ,  majesty ,  dominion , and  authority .  In short, all of these attributes describe God as all-powerful and all-good.  Finally, God is described as  before all time and now and forever .  This does not mean God is timeless.  Rather, it teaches God is not dependent on time.  God's existence is prior to time.  Even time depends on God to exist!  If the big bang model is correct (which is most likely), then it concurs with this observation.  For space and time would literally begin to exist (that is, they are created out of nothing) at the initial moment of the big bang.  God speaks time and space into existence out of nothing.  Wow!  Indeed, God alone is worthy of praise.
