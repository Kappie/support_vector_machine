I was trying to formalize it so a denomination with "0" at the end must do.  I could've done 20 or even 100 things I learned, but, bloody Hell, that's too much.  I'm just a small man.  With a hypoprocessed brain.  Now, this virginity thing is getting on my nerves.  Why is it that the people around me make me think they are NOT virgins?  I can almost believe, except I doubt it.  I mean just look at you people!   Well, unless you are not...and that means I'm totally mislead!!!!!!  Like what I said to Mando before, "Am I the only remaining virgin in the world??!!!"  Just to be saved here, I'm not saying he's not a V.  I just told him that to joke.  He didn't tell me anything.  Besides, if he did tell me, I'm sure I'm not the first to hear it.  But by God, he's so ... active.... in pursuits, ain't he?    And, my God Mark...you could've been influenced by your band mates!  You know, the Sex Drugs Rock 'n Roll thing?  Oh my GOD!!!!  wait, I don't have a God...  I AM the only V in the world!!!!!!  Children excluded.
