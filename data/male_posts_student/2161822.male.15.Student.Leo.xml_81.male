And one more thing that sucks: 15 page research papers. I really hope our research papers don't have to be 15 pages (single spaced too). Because that would ruin life as a whole. So on to my real entry. I really don't have one. Like most days. Our chemistry teacher once again made an idiot out of himself. He really can't read or spell. (equilibium) I can't wait until I don't have him as a teacher. Maybe at least if he remotely knew what he was talking about... And now instead of me rambling on about crap no one wants to read, indulge yourself in a game.  Cow tipping.   Listen to H.I.M.
