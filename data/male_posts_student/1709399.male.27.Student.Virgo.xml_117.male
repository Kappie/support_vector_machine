Morris Writes " My favourite Picasso story concerns the time he went back to look at an old studio of his in Paris , and there , lying on a bench outside the gate , was an old tramp. Picasso recognized the man and asked what had happened to him.The old boy explained that he had fallen on hard times and now had nowhere to live. Picasso went over to a nearby rubbish-bin , pulled out a large piece of cardboard , did a quick drawing on it , signed it , and gave it to the tramp, saying : 'Here, buy yourself a house.'
