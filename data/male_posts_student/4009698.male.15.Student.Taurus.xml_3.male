He demonstrated his slump in the Euro 2004 Quarter Final match against Portugal, when he blasted the ball into row Q. A toe poke if ever i've seen one...  Back to the point. Beckham has missed 3 penalties in a row. Once an accident. Twice a Coincidence. Now that Beckham has missed AGAIN, it leaves me with 2 hypothesis':  1)He's being payed to miss from an outside source, or 2) His reached his peak and is now declining.  After all, it was David who said himself that the ball would be easier to control in dead ball situations. It showed in the Quarter's, didn't it?  I'm willing to hear what you have to say on the matter. leave a comment...
