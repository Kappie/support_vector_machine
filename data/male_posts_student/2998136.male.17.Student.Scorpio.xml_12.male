Because 13 is an unlucky number and it falls on a Saturday instead of Friday and that makes a very lucky day instead. I have long been wanting to setup a blog due to its growing popularity nowadays.  Xiaxue is the one who inspires me to own a blog, and so far she is also one of the most lamest person among the bloggers. She is such a poor hypocrite and a grandmother storyteller. She can't lie properly and can't act well just like William Hung can't sing and dance. Just in case you don't know who she is, you can visit her blog at  urlLink www.xiaxue.blogspot.com .  Alright back to me, another reason for me to blog is that recently my life is full of misfortunes and accident...  I wanna write down my illusions and wild thoughts here to share with you guys how interesting and meaningful my life really is, that you will even dream of me every night, or should I say have more nightmare. See, I am a hyper-active boy who loves to grow roots at home and anti-socialise with others at outside. I keep everything to myself (I know I am Greedy!) and only tell my blog every mishap that had been occurring in my life.  Well, stay tune with my blog and I will do even better than that daughter of the bitch Xiaxue.
