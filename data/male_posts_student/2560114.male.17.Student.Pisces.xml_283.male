It's either one high card and one low card. Then i jus sat around and watched tv...then before i went to sleep, it was hard listenin to my dashboard confessional cd cuz i would alwayz think of her while i'm listenin to it...then i jus broke down and jus let it all out wit tears...it sux, but its somethin i had to do cuz it helps release everything for a moment...or the nite. I ended up writing 2 songs and i thought of a melody in my head, if i only i could play the guitar or have a program to make music on this computer...i guess i have to find one then. I had a dream that nite aswell, that me and her started to get to know each other more, and hangin out more...weird but yeah...then this mornin i e-mailed her about how i felt and how sorry i was about not telling her about my "drinking" incident...hopefully she writes back and then i will know what to do with myself and if i should let go or try again...i don't want this to end up like my last drama case, but yeah...later.
