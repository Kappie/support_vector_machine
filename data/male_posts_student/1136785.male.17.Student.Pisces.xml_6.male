Now I can make fun of all the people whom I was jealous of, as their filthy fucking addicts. Losers!   Yeah, so the musical fucking sucks. Watching a bunch of monkeys dance around stage is bad enough. Teaching a bunch of monkeys to act while dance is simply hellish.  Staying until 8:30 PM to watch said teaching can only be equated to having a rabid male porcupine in heat shoved up my urethra, while simultaneously having pure, concentrated stupidty injected into my oxygen deprived brain. In other words - it ain't fun. The coming monday will prove to be one of the most painful in recent memory. Oh well, it will come, be over, and then I will eventually die. Hopefully I'll lose my virginity in between those last two, though losing it between the former could be fun.
