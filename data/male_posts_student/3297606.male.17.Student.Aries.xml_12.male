I had one of those today. it all started when i went to work an hour early...  So i go in at 5:30 and there is a customer yelling at Yuki, i kinda hurry to the back to punch in so i see whats going on, and when i walk back out, mrs. bray has joined in the festivity. Before you know it, Mrs. Bray sends a whirling punch into this 75 years olds jaw. The old man flys back and hits the floor. I run over to the fight, and mrs bray pulls out a revolver and turns the olf man into cottage cheese. I just kinda froze, and then all of the sudden Yuki turns into a Chinese Dragon! She immediatley scorches the Brandywine (code name for Mrs. Bray) and makes a banana split. I quickly yell out 3 flavors so she doesnt get too confused.  wait, thats not what happened... ok heres what really happend:  i get to baskin robbins an hour early, and yuki is training this new guy named brian... i give out the usual "heeeeey" and go punch in. when i walk back out, Brian is holding a cake, and then, totally spur of the moment, devours the entire thing in like 4.765 seconds! I kinda back up thinking "what the frik" and run into the Brandywine! i turn to apologize for the bump, and she is completely in the nude! i sheild my eyes and fall to the ground. By this time Brian had already exploded, i didn't actually see him explode, but i hear the loud pop and the words "Brian of EXPLODE" over the store speakers. i stumble back, not sure what to do, Yuki had busted out of there, leaving behind a trail of pink convinient spoon molds...  dang it, that didnt happen either.  ok all that really happened is that i went an hour early and it was really boring. and the mop broke again. i hate that stupid mop. But the Brian guy is real, he really is a new guy. thats 2 new guys we have, this is good news.  now there have been at least one million people that have asked me what "somewhere near nowhere" means... its actually quite simple:  somewhere near nowhere - New products and procedures that enter the marketplace are reviewed by the Hair Club team and tested for effectiveness.
