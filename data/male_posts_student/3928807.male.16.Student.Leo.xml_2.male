Today was the first day of camp. I was nervous on the way there but I became pretty relaxed when I got there. We had to open up doors for kids when they got there, so I ended up opening a door for a girl name Erica. Because of this, I believe, she ended up talking to me throughout the day. Then we did those stupid camp songs, and got into a circle to break the ice. There was this one kid who I think is awesome because he reminds me of myself at his age. When asked what his name was and one thing he enjoyed he said "I'm Nicholas and I sometimes watch the news and it makes me sad because of all the bad things they show.. blah blah blah.. and I saw a monkey". Unfortunately he didnt stay the whole day. Of course, there are a few bad kids and they are annoying but I'm pretty damn patient and tolerant, so it's no big deal.   After that we went to arts and crafts, where this one kid who I thought was bad, named Evan, became my first camper friend. We talked about video games and he would design characters and I would draw them. He said we make a good team. He is probably the smartest kid there. After lunch, it was time for "swim activities" or something. I tried to put on my bathing suit but it didnt even go up to my waist, so i'm buying a new one tonight. The swimming period was okay, but kind of boring. After that, everyone got changed and it was time to go to the closing hill or whatever. It was a tiring day, perhaps because I didnt get alot of sleep. I know this sounds stupid, but I want to smoke a bowl before going to camp one day. The problem is I can't think of any concievable time where that would be possible. I guess 7:50. It would give me about 15-20 minutes.   Anyways, overall it was an okay beginning. Now i'm going to go to the convienence store and buy some gum. Then i'll come back and try and sleep or something.
