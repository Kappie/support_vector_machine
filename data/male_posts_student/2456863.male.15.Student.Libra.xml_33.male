And so we stopped complaining and decided to just hang out for the 15 minutes before adam gave his lecture, message, whatever you wanna call it.  And so I was thinking, and then his message started and he says how usually he writes up an outline on what he wants to talk about and then on tuesday he writes it, and then the rest of the week he practices it.  But this week he was lazy and tuesday came around and he had no outline, wednesday, thursday, friday, he kept putting it off.  And then saturday rolls around and he's like oh crap its saturday and i dont have a message.  So he goes through the Bible and eventually he finds something, but then logan comes to clean the church and adam looks at it again and thinks "This sucks" so he crumples it up in a ball and chucks it. "I'll worry about it tomorrow" he thinks so he goes home and to bed and the next day he comes to church and "oh crap i don't have a message" So he prays and thinks and he can't come up with anything, and then 4:30 rolls around, then 5, then 6 (Youthgroup is at 7) and so at 6:30 he decides to take a drive.  And he prays and he's thinking about his friend, who committed suicide, and soon he comes up with his message which he says is "from his heart" But that's not the point of me telling you all this.  The point is, as he told us this and began to give his message, I got inspired to write a poem.  It's written from adam's point of view, and will probably come in the next post after this.  Other than that, the septic truck came today to empty the tanks (what great fun) and woke me up, cuz my bedrooms right by the driveway, and hmmm not much else yet, i've only been awake for like an hour.  I had coco puffs for breakfast along with some white cranberry peach juice, which isn't all that great, but it's ok i guess.  Um heres some more shorts from my journal (the paper one)  Can comprehension be comprehended?  Living life without loving is less than living. -Alliteration here too.  You are, but one of six billion people, wandering in darkness on a blue ball.  This is a poem i found the other day, but don't read into it anything about jenni, i wrote it before I liked her.  "Take Me Away" I hear you calling to me In a dream of despair. Your voice leads me. And I see your face smiling. I reach for you hand, But it is gone. You are gone. I am lost. Take me away. -May 11, 2003 And this one's from my journal.  "Firefly" Love is a firefly. It comes and goes as it pleases, And if you try to hold it against it's will, It dies. -December 16, 2003
