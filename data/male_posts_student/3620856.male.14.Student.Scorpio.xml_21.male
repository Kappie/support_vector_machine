If school is good for us, why so many people commit suicide because of it? We have a fucked up education system...   What to we wish to get after all this education? Do we really need to apply eveything we learn in school when we are out of school? What has A-maths gotta do with me if i wanna be a chef? What has chemistry gotta do with me if i wanna be some boss of some company selling comics?
