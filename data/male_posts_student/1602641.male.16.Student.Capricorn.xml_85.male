He would be replacing Jack Ryan (who you may remember had to drop out of the race last month because of a rather bland sex scandal) as the Republican on the ballot. Prior to this development, Democrat Barack Obama was considered the overwhelming favorite in this race. But now, the possibility of a Ditka candidacy makes the whole thing up for grabs.   Now please give me a moment to express my RAW, UNFILTERED RAGE over this UTTER TRAVESTY. I see a new pattern developing - whenever the FRIGGIN' REPUBLICANS are in a race thay can't win, they bring in some BURLY CELEBRITY WITH NO I.Q. OR POLITICAL EXPERIENCE TO WIN THE HEARTS OF THE IGNORANT ELECTORATE. In California, they were starstruck by THE F***IN' GOVERNATOR. Now in Illinois, we'll have all those sports fans swooning over DA CANDIDATE. I swear, if I hear one more of these STUPID, GIMMICKY PLATITUDES, I WILL BURN DOWN THE F***IN' R.N.C.!!! (Well, I probably won't actually do that, but I certainly will send them a poison pen letter!)
