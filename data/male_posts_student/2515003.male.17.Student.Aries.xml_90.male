I would like to share an ideain my very first post. Why dont we try to increase thenumber of membersin Exun? After all there is no shortage of talent inour school. We can ask the all the teachers of computer department to give the names of good and talented students to us. We can then hold testsand judge them. The best of the lot can be a member of Exun. Howzzat!!
