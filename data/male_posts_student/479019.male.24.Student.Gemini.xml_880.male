Anyway so today was a pretty lazy day as I went to the Belmar last night and ended up doing lots of late night chatting with friends. I pretty much lounged around at home until I went to campus around 7:30 PM to print out pictures of Bowie and other glam folks from the 80s for Melanie (my make up artist). We did a bunch of setting up around 8:15 and the acapella hit the stage around 9:30. Then there was an 80s cover band, a twister competition and a comedian. We ended up earning over $100 to be donated to the Salvation Army's music program. So it was quite a successful night.  Also Kristina, Jade, and I did some Twister at the end of the night, as we cleaned up.  Oh yea... pictures of me glam will eventually be uploaded.  I'm starving right now... it's times like these that I wish I actually ate snack food. I only had a cookie and a soda tonight.  Oh I haven't mentioned it here, but some of you know. I managed to get funding for next year. It's only a semester of funding, but it's something. So I'm renewing my lease with Hayes, and I have a flight booked. Life is looking pretty good... except for my little hard drive problem.  Well there's something else...  I'm just feeling somewhat displaced still.  I have another 2 years here probably, but my sense of home is not really existant. I really don't have anything stable in my life right now. I'm in California 4 months out of the year, hell I don't even have a set weekly schedule, I kind of wish I could have regular drinking buddies, etc. See.. when I was an undergrad, I had a set schedule of work and school. I had regular friends for doing stuff... drinking, going to shows, eating, museums, etc. Here everything is so sporadic and unorganized... even friendships kind of are. I have friends that I don't see or talk to in almost a month.   To be honest, I don't really like how the graduate student community is here. I'm not saying that people are bad, quite the contrary... in general people are pretty cool here. I just feel like there aren't people here with the same interests as I do. I feel more in touch with undergrads actually. However, I feel like I don't totally fit in with them, because I'm a graduate student. Tonight was different though... it was nicer.  ***
