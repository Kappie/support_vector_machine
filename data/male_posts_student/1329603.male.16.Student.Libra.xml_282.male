Not only am I doing it with Ed from CYB, we had a grand total of... oh, probably an hour's work, then we spent the entire rest of the time playing on the keyboards, pianos, and guitars. Rock on.  In other news... oh, wait, there isn't any, really... *thinks* Well, Laura's coming round on Saturday, which'll be cool, gave Mr. T the piano accompaniment to Empty Chairs today, so that he can do it on Thursday, and been thinking about the non-bald person of those 2 rather a lot. Meh, life.  Quote of the day: "I was so high I did not recognise The fire burning in her eyes, The chaos that controlled my mind..."  From Maroon 5's   This Love   Love, Jon Roskilly
