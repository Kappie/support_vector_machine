Edmund, the first year runner who is a senior is an animal and i had to keep up with him. then i went to chris's house and did the usual.  wednesday was an early day, i had to leave my house at about 5:55 am.  practice was aat 6:30 am so that we could beat the heat.  we ran 4 miles, we almost got to Mars, but not quite, then turned around.  we did it in about 30 minutes.  edmund again drug me and BJ around like he had been running forever.  after that i went home and wen tto sleep from about 9 until 12.  it turns out i dont need anything on my liscense, spelling is so far off, to make it a full one, and therefore i have my full license.  then i went to chris's house later and we played some ninja gaiden and 6 person halo.  it was pretty fun.
