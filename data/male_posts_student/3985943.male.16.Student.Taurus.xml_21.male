I wish i could leave them up in Manchester in the woods. Oh well...   *GASP* I found the most incredible house EVER in Clifton Park. I want it. Put it in a box right now and send it to me. This thing is HUGE!!!!! I have a picture on my phone. WANT WANT WANT! I saw it when Jeanette and Dean showed us all the new neighborhods tha are springing up in town. These things are HUGE! Each neighborhood is the size of Portsmouth. It's crazy. I mean, what the Hell is there in upstate New York that draws people!? The world is a screwy place...   So yeah, I'm off to Manchester. I haven't seen my brothers in a week, and I've really gotten used to peace and quiet. Pray for me ( if you do that sort of thing...)   Talk to you later! *HUGS!*
