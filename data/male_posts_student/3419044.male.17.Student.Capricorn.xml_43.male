I only saw 177 km's on the speedometer so technically, I cannot claim to have gone that fast.   But, today, that does not matter. ..    I was awaken today by my sister who gave me the phone.  It was Kim from work, she told me to bring left-handed scissors tomorrow because I have to cut out crap for 'I Love Shaunavon'.  :(  Anyways, I fell asleep and was woken by Tyler.  'Wake up, we're going to Eastend.'  So, I got up, put on clothes and we rode to Eastend.  He bought me my chicken burger with bacon and iced tea.   On the way there, I am proud to say, I went 200 km's.  And this is not a lie, I swear!  I wanted to see the 2 - 0 - 0.  Also, unlike the 180 km's, this was for about half a minute.  I did not reach my speed goal then let off, I rode for a bit which was intense!  It took a bit of time to reach that speed aswell.  We ate, and rode back.  I tried getting to 200 again, but only made 195, riding next to Tyler.  He signalled to stop as my license plate holder was falling off.  So for 10 minutes, I ride with my left hand on the tail of the bike holding this home-made jobbie together.  We stopped in Dollard at an abandoned house and found a bolt to temporarily fix it.     That is my journey for today... Such a fast one at that... :D
