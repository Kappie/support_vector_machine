Ok, so maybe they haven't around here, but I am not about to just say  everything   that has happened in the last couple of weeks (by couple I mean 5-7 weeks, ha ha).   Here at  Three Eye Witnesses  we have some changes upcoming (we will do them this time for sure!): Among those changes include:  1) A weekly quote or thought, etc. Help us out by submitting your own quote today! 2) Our expressions... on the site! This will take some time to get in action, so please be patient. 3) CD and Book Reviews on the site. This is an idea taken from  P.R.E.  (Refer to blog post on Friday, June 06, 2003) 4) A running of index of when lyrics, poems, reviews were posted etc  every week! . It's so its easier for you to find it when you want to!   Thats about it for now! I will now go and start on the changes. :)
