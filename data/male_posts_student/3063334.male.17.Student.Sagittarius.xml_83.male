The novel consists of choppy, simple and compound sentences, to enforce the view which he is writing from(a child's) while also creating a fearful, anxious tone in the book that comes from these choppy sentences.  In class, Ms. V-A spoke of the novels "poetic tone."  I believe this tone is derived from the sentence structure Wiesel uses in the novel(or atleast the first 15 pages).  Is everyone else seeing this tone? Or something different?  -Pat
