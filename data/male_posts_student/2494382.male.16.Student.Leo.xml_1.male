Im sitting here waiting for christmas to come... man i canf friggen wait. I cant wait as much as i cant wait to see this specific person whenever i am about to see her..... You will all have to guess who it is. Anayawz, this week has benn OK.. My cousin had comed in from Arizonia and hes like my age. The kids tight, dont let me misinform u, but b/c hes here im wasnt able to do anything with my friends, which totally sucks. I like family but i love the friends. I realized how much it sucks like sitting here at night thinking what bri, jon, blat, claire, ally ess tess and mart are doing.. i no what it is is tight.   So id like to give it up to everyone and i wish u a merry christmas, and hope that none of your relativcees are locked down in a high security prison somewhere in Iraq waiting to be questioned by top US officials.  To all- MERRY FRIGGEN CHRISTMAS and by the way, your truly MIGHT be having a P.I.P.M new years party wither everyine, not just like 200 or 300 people... all 50,000 from SLP so yea be excited
