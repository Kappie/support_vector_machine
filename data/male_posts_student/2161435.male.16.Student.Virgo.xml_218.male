ThenI leave for spain tonight, at 11pm to be exact, on a ferry from Plymouth. Tomorrow I will be in a car in France and the next day, or maybe the day after that I will arrive at a campsite near Madrid - Spain - yay!!! I will be returning on the 8th of August, or the Sunday of that weekend anyway, after 2 and a half weeks of sun :o) I shall see you all again then! Enjoy your holidays/camps and take lots of photos for me to look/laugh at, I'll do the same! :o)  Bye bye for now  P.s. Rob I hope you have realised that I have written this whole post in proper english, just so you can't shout at me!
