When I'm not working on homework, I just decide to go play some Final Fantasy XI or Dance Dance Revolution.  That takes up a lot of my time.  Well, last night it was Nick's b-day sleep over thing.  His birthday was a couple of days ago, so he had a celebration.  There was much fun to be had last night ^^.  Me and James brought over DDR to his house and we got to hook it up to the big tv in the basement.  On the small tv we hooked up Nick's Gamecube and played lots of Super Smash Bros. Melee.  There was something to do all night long.  We started the night with some poker, though.  First game, I lost in the first few hands (we were using poker chips worth imaginary money), but later on, I had a pile of chips that none of us wanted to count ^_^.  While that was fun, the DDR was terrible for me...  I was totally out of it...  I couldn't even pass Tsugaru...  Oh, well, I have a lot of practice left.  Since Nick had only played DDR once in his life, we had to give him our lesson.  His other friend that came had never played, but by the morning we had them both doing at least a few four footers.  So where was I... I meant to start this talking about how school is gonna end and how annoying it is and all of the junk that we're forced to do etc, etc.  Everyone knows the drill, right?  If you don't just go over to McDonald's and ask the people working what they think about school (hehe ^^).  I decided that since I tend to play a lot of FFXI, that I'll try to update this thing at least once a week, highlighting everything interesting that happens (don't get your hopes up though ^^;).  Well, I'm doing this pretty early because I'm actually tired from yesterday, so I'll talk to you all next week.  (>^_^)>
