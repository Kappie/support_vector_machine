GOODNESS!  there are a ton of 8th graders!  my butt was hurtin soooo bad sittin on those bleachers!  ha!  i saw that crazy Amanda Loew!  lol... that freaky thing is just insane!  after the graduation James, L, and i went to casa blanca with some of the 8th graders.  it took them FOREVER to get their food.  we were done before they even got their food... so James, L, and i went to the mall and walked around.  that was fun i guess.  now im home... church tonight!  what what!  cant wait... cept i'm like EXHAUSTED!  i just hada pepsi so hopefully the caffeine will kick in.  anyways... im gonna finish watchin the season finale of 24!  oh yes baby!  oh and man havent talked to Emma in a while now!  where is that girl!?
