I can't feel it. I don't know if I've ever really 'felt' my soul. It's presence.. I can't remember it. Maybe I don't have a soul. Maybe I'm the one soulless being on this planet. If I am.. well, i guess that makes me unique, doesn't it? I just wish i could feel.....something. Love, happiness.. something. I don't like this at all. Mom says she's going to call the clinic monday for medicine, and for the first time in my life, I'm actually looking forwawrd to it. Music has been the only thing keeping me going lately. Music, Steve and Beth, that's all you need, right? wrong.. because eventually your depression spreads and it just makes you feel worse.  nip it in the bud, isn't that what they say? anyways.. i'm gonna go kick some ass at trivia to work off the frustrations. later.
