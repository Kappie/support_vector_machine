My brother has come to Delhi and at his insistence , I bought a Philips TV a few days back. I had consciously avoided having a TV since its an addiction which leaves with you with little time to pursue other interests.                                                            Nevertheless I am now looking forward to catch up on some movies which I have been wanting to see for a long time (Mostly60's/70's Hollywood/Bollywood fare) .
