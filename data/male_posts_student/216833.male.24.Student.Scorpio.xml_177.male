Went to the college today to talk with Tia the conselor and the damn evaluation office has not finished my transcript evaluation for CSU. No worries. I went ahead and planned out my Fall '03 semester and it looks like it's going to be Biology, Math(College Algebra and Trig), and Chemistry. 12 units of pure homework hell I'm sure. That's okay, progress ahead is better than working on something in vain; I hope those other classes I took will transfer - still in the dark but I will find out in the fall. Right now, I just need to continue to review algebra so I don't fall on my ass and I should be fine.  I am going over to Pam's house tomorrow to help her with her Apple. She is the scheduling lady at the Bird Rescue Center and out of the blue she calls me to see if I want to help her. haha, whatever, i guess. I think the mother-in-law might be moving out soon. Not sure, but that is what it sounds like. That's gonna be odd, becuase then we will have to find a roommate. Havn't ever had to do that, but whatever.   current mood:  determined current music: The Promise Ring - east texas avenue
