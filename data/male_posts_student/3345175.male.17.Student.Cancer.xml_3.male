I posted it because i had to get some things out, and didnt think that you'd end up reading this before i got a chance to talk to you.  Please dont be annoyed with me over this - i do want you to come over. I just dont think us having sex would be such a good idea. If that is what's pissed you off (that right now im not ready to have sex with you) then i suppose i should be the one thats more than a little pissed off.   I honestly love you to bits, and i dont wanna pursue this thing with sumone else - because trying to do the inexclusive thing with two guys would be as silly right now for me (and for you and him) as me trying to do the exclusive thing with you.  I didnt post this for you. I posted it for me, to release some thoughts and tension because right now ive got everything flowing through my brain at 120mph including my feelings on this, information (and worries) about the two worst Highers i have one after the other that im not prepared or confident enough to take, and me having a massive blow-out with my very best friend in the whole world, where i came across as an arse and hurt her feelings very badly.  This isnt about you. This is about me, and the reason i keep repeating the inexclusive thing is to remind myself, not you. Because if i forget that for two seconds my feelings for you will get stronger and stronger (as they are already getting) much faster, and i will end up getting us both into a relationship that i cant commit to and i wont hurt you like that.  I like you way too much to jerk you around like that. But obviously you're having some problems with "us", so if youd care to express them for once instead of everything being bloody hunkey-dorey then that would be a change. Maybe not a happy one, but that way im not the only one being completely honest about how they feel.  Is that not what we're supposed to be with each other? Honest?  You're always bloody happy about everything, and it makes me feel like the fucking badguy in all of this. Which, maybe i am. But how the hell can you feel the way you claim to about me and be okay with half the shit we talk about.  'I love you, but go ahead and toss it around town. I dont mind.'  Meanwhile you have no interest in doing anything with anyone else, and so i end up being the only part of this relationship that is inexclusive, and you're closing yourself off to anything romantically that doesnt involve me. I dont like being the centre of attention, you know.  I love you, but we have to talk. And this time we have to talk without me going back on it two minutes later like happened last time. Im sorry i wrecked your high, but that is why we need to talk. You claim you dont care about me seeing other people, and that i should do it anyway, but talk of this manages to ruin you being happy? That shows that you're not being totally honest with me, and it shows that we are both getting a bit too emotionally dependant on each other for two people not in an exclusive relationship.  I wish it could be more. I really REALLY fucking wish it could be right now. But it cant, because i dont have the time or the patience to manage exams plus you plus a whole Summer away from you. I dont expect you to wait around for me. But i cant wait until the point where i can let myself love you the way i really want to.  For anything in this, or anywhere else, that has offended you or upset you more, then i have nothing to say. Sorry doesnt begin to cover it.
