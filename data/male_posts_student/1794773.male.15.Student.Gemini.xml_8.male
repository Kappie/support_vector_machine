I'm not even sure if we're going. but we will need to make plans for that real soon. like when and how we'll get there. I'm not sure if it will all work out but I think it will be really fun. so krista or rachael or anyone who hasnt had a movie night I think we should have one real soon. just pick a day any day is fine for me. cuz we sure have lots and lots to talk about.   LOVE, Erica.
