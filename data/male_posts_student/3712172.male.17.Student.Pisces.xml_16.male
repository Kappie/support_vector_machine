So we're waiting for a few others to show up so we can watch it. I am pumped to see this movie :)  Work was deadly tonight, they put me strictly on the supervisor line so I got next to no calls. It rocked. About time I get a break from 50 people waiting to get thru over the phones. I got a bunch of good calls tonight though, some extremely irate consumers that were sick of speaking with the normal representatives. Such adament bastards. I swear some people are so selfish and don't have the morality to give anybody a break.  Anywho, I will post later. Movie, and food time.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Keep it real guys!
