I was laying in bed and was so bored and got to thinkin I hadn't updated in a while and decided to have a go. OK. So. What's been happening well. It's the summer break and I really really need a job. I need to money to fund my expensive taste in shoes and clothes. I would also like to by myself a cute little italien retro scooter - extreamly camp, so I can have some freedom. I would also like to decorate my boudior in suede and faux fur with cappuccino walls and a big fluffy king size bed. And for all of this I need some money. I have applied at the local jam factory and co-op but no one wants me even with all my grade A/B GCSE's! Why why why don't they like me, all I ask for is a little job, friends that work for both of these companies have told me there are job vaccancies, so what's goin on. What I really need to do is ask my dad to hand over the money in my trust fund thing. I'm not supposed to get it until I'm eighteen but why, I need it now, it makes more sence to have it now. With the money, which I think is a good grand and a half I'll get myself a scooter and lessons and a cute little matching helmet. Then i'll be able to look for a job properly, I can go much further affield. Apparently Arron got himself a job at the jam factory as an IT junior. Huh!!! Only the other week he was telling me how he was hopeless at computers. Now, I don't really want a careea in IT but i'd be a damn sight better tham him and I have the GNVQ to proove it, almost. How the hell did he manage to get himself a £40/hour job. I'm soooo jealous of Mr Arron. It's not fair, he just has everything I want, and yet I can't hate him cause I just love him so much. Talking about guys I love, I only saw John Jup earlier today, my primary school heart throb. He was looking absolutly delicious and also v v gay, with his big quiff, blonde/dark hair. I remember one time in year six, there was six of us at the desk including me, katie (not my ex katie, a different one) and john himself. Katie totaly fancied john and so did I, although I don't think I quite realised that made me a total homo, but, anyway, once I looked in katies diary and it said I love john, as teenage girls do, I immediatly, nastely shouted this from the rooftops telling everyone what katie wrote. Lookin back I now realisie I wasn't bothered by the fact that katie liked him, it was kinda like I used katies words to let out my true feelings, kinda like when one says something jokeingly when it is really the truth. I have always been gay since I can remember. I remember one time when we used to go swimming in primary school and the best part was getting to see the other boys 'willies', sorry I just can't use that word, cocks, the other boys cocks. Me and my mum seem to get closer everyday and me and my sister as well. My brother on the other hand hates me more than ever, which is fantastic. Since coming out I've found myself suddenly absolutly adoring Cher which is really cool, I've also sudenly developed I likeing for judy garland and daughter. Oh, shit, I've just realised, I missed Queer Eye. Damn, I love that show so much and that's the second time I've missed it. And I was watching a recording at the time which I could have watched anytime. Gay tv is so important to me right now more than ever. I have no role models around me, I know no gay people, TV is the only place I can see my people. I'm loving will  grace right now as well, and sex and the city, all this gay/gal TV is great. I just got thinking, on my last day of school I got my friends to sign my bye bye book and rekon I should add a few of the comments on here:  Laura B  Hi ya Jon!
