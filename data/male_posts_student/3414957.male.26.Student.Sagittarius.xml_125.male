He said that he remembered a nun that looked like Brian Denehey (the dad from Tommy Boy) with that nun hat on. I was dying because I went to catholic private schools almost all my early school career. Then he started to talk about "diesel lesbians" and how they kick ass and stuff. I really enjoy that show. I want to find a website that has show downloads for free. I found a website that has tons of  Phile Hendrie  mp3's on it for  free !   So I was thinking today. I was kinda down and just thought where will I be in 10 years? My answer to myself was living in a modest home somewhere in or around Vancouver alone. That actually made me happy. I think the happiest times I can remember was in my Oceanside and Fallbrooke apartments in California. Well, my old apartment in Vancouver I had before the Navy was cool too. I remember the times when people from work would try to get me to go out with them and I just told them I was busy. They alwasy bugged me about being a hermit. I loved it though. I read books all the time, played my PS2, and watched dvd's while tossing back some beers. Man, I felt great. I felt totally free, I came in when I wanted, left when I wanted and best of all....I answered to no one. I had a phone but I always had the ringer off or I just let it ring then I *69'ed it to see if it was work or not! LOL. Those were the days baby!
