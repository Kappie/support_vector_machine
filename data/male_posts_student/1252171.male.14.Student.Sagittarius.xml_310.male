Oh yeah...Goku is a like a monkey demon and he was imprisoned for commiting a really bad crime(like what mike would do to me if I plastered he loves 'M' on the internet for the world to see, only much worse) and Sanzo saved him. His demon restricter, so he looks human and is sane, is that crown thing he wears all the time so he doesn't kill everyone in sight, including friends. Then there is the unorthodox monk Sanzo. He is at the highest rank of monk there is. He is constantly threatening to shoot people and for comic reief, hits Goku and Goyjo. Next is Goyjo himself(mental drool and anime fall)I MEANT TO DO THAT! Um, yeah, well Goyjo is half demon, a water sprite to be exact, and he is with the group to find his brother who saved him from his mother who tried to kill him. *AWWWWW!!!!* But he is a womanizer, and drinker, a gambler, and a smoker, so with the hottness comes that bad stuff =(. And last but not least there is Hakkia. He is a unnateral demon cause he became a demon after he killed like 1000 demons to get to the woman he loved. But she killed herself. More on that later. But Hakkia is very brotherly, and has an ADORABLE pet dragon that Darkblaze would love. But I'm guessing D will not be on for a while because we just got our report cards and....*gets shoe thrown at her* Ah! Bye! -Dilussional Child- (ps I'm leaving tomorrow. BYE i'll mis you all! *insert Hulk ending theme here, from the old shows*)
