Well Friday night I got ridiculously drunk and was just out of control.  NOt a real great state to be in.  I think I made a big ass out of myself a bunch of times but who cares, I'm young and it's going to happen.  I have tons of tests and speeches this week.  Have a huge take home test in Rhetoric which is kicking my ass and a music test in like 15 min and speech next week and tons of other stuff.  But I think I'm going down to Texas to se the greatest musician of all time, Willie Nelson, on the 11th.  Just 3 days after my 23rd birthday.  Happy Birthday to me.  That should be a great time. I'm sure theres more to say but I gotta run to my test or I'm going to be late which won't be good.  I'll try to get back to you folks later when i have some more meaningful wisdom to impart upon you.  Until then, Keep it real...
