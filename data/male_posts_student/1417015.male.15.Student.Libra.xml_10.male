"Good morning / afternoon, WTI training group, Adam speaking, how can I help?" It's hammered into me, I'm probably going to start answering real phones with it soon. Not that the phones at work aren't real, but they're not really real, if you see what I mean. Like when someone says "what use will pi be in real life?" to Mr. Easterbrook in maths.  So far, in my three days of being there, I've answered loads of phones and put together a crappy looking desk to replace a really nice solid oak one. You've gotta laugh when you're trading an antique piece of furniture for a flat-packed Ikea MFI MDF DIY Chipboard crap thing.  Recently I've been spending all my money on CDs, which is both a good and a bad thing. It means I'm no longer downloading music that often and stealing for pleasure, but it also means I have no money.  And in the end, HELLO CH-EYE.  Bye.
