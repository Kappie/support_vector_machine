It is, in two words, FUCKING HILARIOUS. If, that is, you can understand it. I can, thus confirming to any that doubted it my innate geekiness. Her favorite part of the whole thing is the same as mine:     **A group of Uruk Hai encounter Boromir    Boromir: "OH FFS, TEAMS!!"    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Uruk Hai [arrow] Boromir    Boromir: "****ing campers"      You can find the whole thing  urlLink here.
