I have been outside only three times in a week and a half. I am completely bored. People say they are bored, but try not being able to sit for more than 10-15 minutes, not being able to do any physical activity, and have the damned tv for entertainment.There is nothing intelectually stimulating on tv so I watch bad 80s sitcoms until I doubt if I will be able to "think critically" come september.  I woke up this morning at noon, realized it doesnt matter what I do, when I get up  cause I cant do anything. So I slept until 3. And have been frickin laying for a week and a half. I havent had an appetite for two weeks, cause I get no exercise. I am too depressed to get any work done for school. pray for me
