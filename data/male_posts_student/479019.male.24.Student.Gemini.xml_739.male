I did a tiny bit of revisiing yesterday... not enough though.  I watched  Secretary  last night. That was one trippy movie. I really enjoyed it, because despite the weirdness of the characters... they were interesting. You wanted Lee and Mr. Grey to get together despite their really weird relationship. Also that Peter guy looks like Corey Feldman.  It's snowing like crazy right now... I wonder if I should see if my ATM still works and go to Burger King.  **
