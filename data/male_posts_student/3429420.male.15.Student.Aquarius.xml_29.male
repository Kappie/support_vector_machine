Perhaps somewhere where I can find love and care or perhaps a dark corner where i can cry alone I do not know..  Treading upon the silent street Hands warmed by my side Eyes cast down Every step leads me into the oblivion  The lingering pain in my heart  was my solitude companion and none could take it from me
