My sister comes in at 10:30 this morning and wakes me up to ask if I can watch her play Super Smash Brothers, and then gets mad at me when I say no.  So I laid in bed and listened to Atticus II for about 30 minutes, then decided to get up and go watch her play for a little while.  Then she wanted to do something else, so I watched some TV for a while while i was eating breakfast.  Last night I went and hung out at Claire's house, because Dabney got back from the beach yesterday, so she was over there too.  It was pretty fun, but I was really tired and stuff so I didn't talk that much... even though I already don't talk that much, which kinda made me mad at myself, but oh well, can't change what has already passed.  I don't have any plans today, might go to the Hooter's grand opening with Trent and Andy, but that's the only thing that is going on... Oh well, I'll probably find something.
