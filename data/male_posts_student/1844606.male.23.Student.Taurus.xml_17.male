And I put the title in quotation marks not because its the way you're offically supposed to do it, but rather, its cause every mindless idiot out there has posted either "Over the hills and far away" or "Black Dog" as the "Immigrant Song"  Oh, and for those of you like Larz Ulrich who think this is wrong, I own the CD, its just not with me right now.  Suck it
