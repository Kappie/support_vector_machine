I'm going to talk about someones brother now.  No names mentioned but if you know who this person is and more then likly you don't. You would know who I'm talking about.  This person is a very unique person by far.  Yes he is a little slow  but something about this guy just stands out and I really like him.  He is his own self and just by talking to him for a quick second you can learn so much about him by his facial expresions and the tone in his voice.  When watching a skit on mad tv that had a shit load of blood in it, it actually grossed him out that he had to leave the room and this was a skit done by mad tv!  He stood up and left the room and it shocked me.  It really showed his character,  He is such a nice guy and he is so nice it is one of the points where if anything bad happend to him I would feel bad.  Kind of reminds me of this one girl I knew who had 100$ stolen from her but anyways back to my little story. This kid is sort of anti social only going out to do martial arts or thats what I have seen of him.  When he is doing martial arts he is in his own world and its tight as hell if you can zone out on something like this to where the people around you don't matter at all one bit.  He is doing his own thing and nothing matters to him excpet whats at hand.  I wish people were like this more all the time with life, didnt care one fucking bit what other people thought but yet still had the morals and respect to treat others as humans.  (If that makes any sense)  that would fix so many problems in this world if people just did their own fucking thing.  Owell,  what I'm trying to say is allthough I'm not saying this to your face and doubt I ever will,  your still a good friend of mine even though we only do little talks and never hang out together.  You need some help with anything and Ill help you.   hrmm... my first real journal entry and it just made me relize how nice of a guy I am. LOL
