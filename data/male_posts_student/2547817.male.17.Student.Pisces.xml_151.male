Rhythms of Nature   Gun still smoking when the hoof beats stop 5000 species of birds and no sound Cacophony of insects in the evening and birds at 6am And at 6pm The tenor song of frogs on rainy nights  Rainy nights. Rain The sound of rain on a windowpane The smell of yesterday's showers To know that every puddle is meant to be stepped in The shimmering sound of fairies drying their wings  Their wings. Rustle of leaves, small stirrings, in trees The way flowers bloom and fall to the ground. Blossoms on the grass Stupid weeds that refuse to be pulled out Stupid flowers that die too easily Grass under your shoes  Under your shoes. Footsteps on gravel Steps on leaves Step Step Step Step Step on the Ant! Fading footsteps in a gloomy morning  Morning. Breathing Heartbeat Tribal music, jungle beat Rhythms, drums, music, beat, STOMP! The dark primitive dance that lasts throughout the night but disperses into little shattered fragments at dawn,  running, hiding, seeking  Seeking. Love Marriage Children Growing up LIFE! The thump thump of my heartbeat, The thump thump of yours
