The place is called Aamco, its kind of funny that even though my dad doesn't actually work there, he can go in and use the shop for whatever he wants...and the guy who owns the place still pays him $150 a week...FOR NO REASON! Well, there probably is a reason, since my dads a fucking gangster, he more than likely owes him money or some shit and he's paying it off slowly, lol. So im there till about 11:30am then my dad asks me to do him a favor. He hands me $10 and tells me to pick up my sister and her friend from the house and then drive down to Sheridan Street. Which is like a good 10 minute drive one way, and I was exhausted to begin with. The really shitty part is, that on the way back, I got fucking lost...and then it starts to down poor. Like cats and dogs down poor, it sucked. I ended up having to call my dad to figure out where I was. I hate the high-way sometimes, its not descriptive enough. Like one sign will say, "North," but the street you're already on is going North. And then there's no other sign saying that the road you are on now, is going to start going in a completely different direction then the one you were going in. ITS SO CONFUSING! Maybe im just dumb...or not...who knows. So anyway, I get home, take a nap, and go to work. And work is fine, no problems, lots of conversation, not too boring...but when we close Chris comes up to me and tells me my fucking drawer is $6.05 short. I don't understand how that happen, its never happened before. Well, good news is we made a tip cup that night and I made $3, so I gave him the three and he said he would cover the rest for me this time. God damn did that suck, lol. Wow...what an exciting day...and now I have to hope that I can somehow talk Rich (the new General Manager at the store) into not making me come in tomorrow ::wishes self good luck:: Welp, till next time...
