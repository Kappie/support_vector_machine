With these two fads have come some flashy new armwear, namely a $1 cancer research bracelet available at  urlLink wearyellow.com  and a red-string  Kabbalah  bracelet currently selling for $25.99 at  urlLink Target .  Already, celebs are taking sides; the aforementioned  Madonna    Brit  pair sport  Kabbalah    bands along with  Kutch -lover  Demi Moore , while a slue of mentionables are wearing the yellow cancer bracelet;  Bono ,  Alec Baldwin ,  Bruce Willis ,  Robin Williams ,  Matt Damon  and  Ben Stiller  are among them. Most notably, however, has been the recent fashion of presidential candidates  Bush  and  Kerry , who both have been seen with yellow bands on,  Kerry  during his campaign.  All this commotion seems to beg a simple question: Which bracelet is better? Looking at the benefits of each purchase, we see that for $25 less than a  Kabbalah  string you can donate money to cancer research (and add to the current $7 million raised). But wait, my anxious friend. The  Kabbalah -wear may be pricy, but it is said to "protect against the evil eye" (notice how the paparazzi has backed off  Brit  a little since her buy?). So, in essence, you're either going to help someone else or protect yourself (for a little extra charge).  I currently wear neither of these things. Sure, the cancer idea is great, but I've been trying to get this  evil eye  to fuck off for  months  now. He's seen every single one of my moves... every single one  (a big sorry to my dog). So I'm kind of stumped on what to buy. And speaking of stumped, this kind of craze must really get to amputees and the limbless, just like the whole "no-carb" fad must make anorexics feel pretty left out (water  crackers is not an  Atkins  option). But finally, we do have a decision that's harder to make than the '04 vote (just go for the guy with yellow on his wrist...oh shit).
