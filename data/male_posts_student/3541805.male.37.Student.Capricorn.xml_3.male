In a nut shell, about three years ago, I decided to combine the two words, Kenzo + Gambit, in order to create a suitable screen name for a chess playing account that would articulate my interest in chess, my profession, and that would also pay tribute to my dead Burmese cat, Kenzo. Symbolizing the adventurous and luxurious lifestyle of my cat, as well as reflecting my former professional title of Perfumer, the name Kenzo was inspired by the Japanese fashion designer and his exotic oriental perfumes. Whilst, gambit was a reference to an opening move in the game of chess in which a player sacrifices a pawn or other minor piece in order to gain a strategic advantage.   Well since the creation of the KenzosGambit screen name about three years ago, I have played around nine hundred games of chess at www.pogo.com, and have experienced many ups and downs in my professional and personal life. Unfortuanetly, there have been more downs than ups. And, at the moment things are really shit. I no longer have a career, my marriage sucks and I really don't have much of a support network to help me through this rough patch. Oh well, I guess that's life, and I'll have to deal with it.   To tell you the truth.....I am not sure what I really expect to accomplish with this Blogspot. But, maybe in a strange way by writing this blog I'll be able to make some sense of what's going on and what I should do to get out of this mess.   I'll leave it at that for now. So, before I go....I’ll just finish with two more trivial facts concerning the meanings of Kenzo + Gambit: (1) if look up Kenzo in the Microsoft Word dictionary, the definition for a Kentucky rifle is suggested. Which is a muzzle-loading rifle developed in the 18th century and widely used on the American frontier. And, an alternative to the chess definition of Gambit is a remark to open a conversation.  Until next time….Take care!!!
