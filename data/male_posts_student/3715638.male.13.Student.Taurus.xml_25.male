I should be singing my part, "The Military", thats right, The Military. I'm Gerneral Gengus Cong Schmitz, I scare childern out of their wits (oops, those were some of my lines! Hehe, I've almost memerized them and its only the first week!).  I'm getting kind of made at camp (which is the play) because we keep practicing the same parts and we never tired my part until today. The director got really made at Caitlin today and made her cry! I felt really sorry for her because she didn't know what she was suppost to do and he was showing of the shit that he was telling her down her throught. Hes getting to be a real annoying bitch. Only Brandi and Josh are the nice ones. Dan (the     EVIL    director) never does any scene except Wickershim and The Whos.     Ok, so, I'm going to B regionals. There Saturday and I'm not really scared at all. Normally I'm freaking out now because there so close, but, nope, not this time. I can't wait till them and when I get on the block and swim butterfly! I'm so excited. How pathitic? Well, I've got practice and normally, I would be leaving really soon but nope because of my sister and her injury.
