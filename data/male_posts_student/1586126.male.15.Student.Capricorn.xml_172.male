O.o) and there was this really crappy/commercial reggae on the radio... and the music ended and then the dj started accepting phone calls.   most of them were rants about the government, so here's one i snatched into my memory:  why does the government spend all that money on tourism and not on rebuilding the goddamned roads that we have?  i mean comeon, the roads have like huge holes in them and what does the MOPT do about it? they start drawing hearts on the street?! HWY DO YOU HAVE THAT STUPID GUY IN CHARGE?!   and what would happen if they actually got to fix the streets? more tourism! because the gringoes get bored of crappy roads, dont you get it?! how many gringos have ever set foot on say, [insert name of remote place in costa rica here]? why? because theyre not gonna spend four hours in a grav-- i mean, swamp type of road, just to get to a goddamn beach/thing/whatever.  so i say, get better roads, get better tourism. invert on tourism, and you only get a bunch of gringos infesting the local mcdonald's up.  *licks the reader*
