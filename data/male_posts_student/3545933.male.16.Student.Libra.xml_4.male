Science is the BIG problem with my GCSE's. a long time i have spent toiling around memorising, or at least attempting to science facts. but hell, i can't even remember the topic titles. i seriously am going to fail, this GCSE, this double GCSE. its just going to be a catastrophe come Monday morning, i'm starting to think that i should actually not go to Rockingham tomorrow and stay home and revise, but i don't think its going to be much help. my main problem is i am a sucker for distraction. i mean, while writing this blog i'm watching some TV program that sucks, but i'm being utterly distracted by it, causing me to slow down and make this blog seem more slap-dash.  what i need, is a catalyst. i need something to spur me on, something to push me and keep me going. thats where the blogs name came from, i need a catalyst. i lack a catalyst, i do things for a reason, but i have it firmly etched in my head that i don't need to pass this GCSE, i can survive without it, thats what i truly feel. that and i'm lazy, so lazy that it pains me to actually do anything which i feel i won't get a reward from.   help.
