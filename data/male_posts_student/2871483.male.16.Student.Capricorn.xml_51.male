A few bands that I listen to that came and never left.  The Offspring Pink Floyd Radiohead The Beatles Jimi Hendrix Experience Green Day Led Zeppelin Aerosmith  Wow, that list grew a little.  -  So, yeah, blogger felt like being a BITCH for a day and didn't let me publish until recently.  But hey, still better than Xanga!  -  I can't believe this goddamn vacation is almost over with.  I'm pissed off, I didn't get any real down time.  -  Everyone, Everyone is so near. Everyone has got the fear. It's holdin' on.  -  I think the Blazers are pretty much screwed.  I think they have to win every game up to the playoffs to be in the playoffs.  My teams always get screwed over.  Just look at the Mariners' opening game.  -  The guys at  urlLink Red vs. Blue  were slacking off for awhile, but surprizingly, they've been able to crank 'em out once a week.  For anyone who has no clue what I'm talking about, go there.  Go to the season 1 archive, and download the first four episodes.  The series is hilarious, but you kinda have to watch it from the start.  -  I now leave you with something different...  Drag 'em out the window, Draggin' out the dead, Singin' I miss you, Snakes and Ladders, Flip the lid, Out pops the cracker, Slaps you in the head, Knifes you in the back, Kicks you in the teeth, Steel-toed caps, Takes all your credit cards, Step up, get the gunge.  Get the eggs, Get the flan in the face, The flan in the face, The flan in the face, Dance you fucker, Dance you fucker, Don't you dare, Don't you dare, Don't you flan in the face Take it with the love it's given, Take it with a pinch of salt, Take it to the taxman.  Let me back, Let me back, I promise to be good, Don't look in the mirror, At the face you don't recognize, Help me call the doctor, Put me inside, Put me inside, Put me inside, Put me inside, Put me inside.  I keep the wolf from the door, But he calls me up, Calls me on the phone, Tells me all the ways, That he's gonna mess me up. Steals all my children, If I don't pay the ransom, And I'll never see him again if I squeal to the cops.  No, no, no, no No no, no no, no no no!  Walkin' like giant cranes, With my X-ray eyes, I strip you naked, In a tight little world, Are you on the list? Stepford wives who are we to complain?  Investments and dealers, Investments and dealers, Cold wives and mistresses, Cold wives and sunday papers, City boys in First Class, Don't know we're born just to know, Someone else is gonna come and clean it up, Born and raised for the job, Someone always does always pick it up, I wish you'd get up get over, Get up get over, Turn this tape off.
