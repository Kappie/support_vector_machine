It has some sort of dark parts later on, but I liked it.   Return of the King was so awesome! I finally saw it yesterday. Eowyn kicked the Witch King's ass! Ha ha! I especially enjoyed the adaptation for film of the above line. I forget exactly how it went, but I remembered that part from the book, so while I was watching, I was like, "Say it... say it..." And Frodo and Sam had some very nice love scenes. And there were oliphaunts!   Thomas, were you gone because you had to return a Ring, or possibly because you joined the army, or possibly because you fell into a parallel dimension?     I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.
