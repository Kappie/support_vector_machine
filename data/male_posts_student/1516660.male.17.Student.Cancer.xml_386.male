So, a dream come true in a dream. :P I am crapping. Oh my god! I experienced a whole host of emotions! How entrancing! How beautiful! How..wild! I'll never forget this moment and I hope this dream will continue tonight. *drowns himself in the pool of boundless emotions* *feels so helpless, because he can't tell anyone about the dream*  Right. I woke up at 8 something. YaY! Finally woke up late! Heh. I woke up, took a long bath, then went down to buy 8 Days. O.O! Daniel Radcliff is on the cover! O.O! I wonder why they didn't feature Tom Felton too. Or Emma Thompson, the crazy Trelawney! HaHaHa!   After breakfast, I went online and stayed online the whole day. I didn't do any homework. Bad person!!   Well. Technically, I didn't stay at home the whole day. I went to Woodlands Central to go eat lunch and shop at Sheng Shiong with parents. Yes. Lunch was boring. We brought lotsa stuff at Sheng Shiong.   I came back, went online. I got some PW work to do. I did them, chatted for a bit, then went to bath. I ate dinner then came online lor.  Right. I sounded terribly rushed. That's because I want to read a long chapter, then watch Miss Universe. I wonder who won. Meow!  See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
