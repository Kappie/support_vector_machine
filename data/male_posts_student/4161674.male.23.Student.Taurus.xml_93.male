But I just saw something which is making me question that assumption: I noticed two ants scurrying around on my dining room table. Before I could sweep them away, one of the ants picked up the other one, walked over to the edge of the table and tossed his struggling victim over the edge. Now I can truly say that I've seen everything as I've witnessed an ant homicide. All was put right on the dining room table as justice was swiftly meted out to the murderer. I remain I.F. -- judge, jury and executioner.
