Ed met my family.. most of them anyways.. and more than just 5-10 minutes of hi and bye.. he hung out here from the moment I pulled into the driveway from work til about 10ish.  We had a blast, my family really likes him and he says that he really likes my family so it is all good.. no I take that back it is all GREAT! tomorrow I get to go meet his parents.. I talked to his dad on the phone for about 5-10 minutes while Jen was doing my hair he is soo funny and great, I think we will get along great! Oh guess what happened today in the life of Carolyn? she was telling me about it.. ok she is a sample girl at walmart.. and Uncle B took her to work today and she couldnt find the station that she had to be at so Uncle B was like ok you stay here and talk to the lady or whatever I will go look for the station.. so when he left the lady was like "so I see you brought your husband today?!?" Carolyn BUSTED out laughing (I would too hehe) and she was like umm that is not my husband that is my UNCLE!! lol.. she said that she laughed all day today about it.  I talked to my little buddy Luke earlier.. he is really kewl.. he has a mental disability and people make fun of him a lot and stuff.. I think he is adorable, but I have a heart for people like that.  he has the heart and the mind of a 4-5 year old.. I dont know if I really like his sister all that well.. see what happened is a year ago his mother died so now he has to live with his older sister who is about 23-24 years old.. and she is kinda real strict on him.. and she I dont know.. there is just a few things about her that he tells me that bothers me.. well anyways.. she (Michelle) is going on a trip this summer and and dont know what to do with him.. so he is talking to her about maybe letting him come here and stay with me.. he told me tonight that she wants to talk to me and everything but she is at work a lot and stuff so she is not home too often.. Well I will keep you all updated on how it goes.. when I get to talk to her.. I have met her before.. but we didnt really discuss this at all.. I think I could handle it.. he is not like on meds or anything or have any seizures and stuff.. he is just mentally behind.. got the mental capacity of a 4-5 year old as I said before.. oh well my Edzo is back on now so I need to find out what is going on tomorrow.. I am going to meet his parents! I will write later buh byes ~Donna~
