They are sleeping in my room, so I've been crashing in the basement and will be until Friday.  Okay. Here is something that has really been bothering me. There is a person in one of my classes who is a fake. A total fake. They have been extremely fake-y for as long as I have known them. Now, the severity of this person's fake-ness has increased to a point beyond tolerability. It's pissing me off, and I think it is communicable via air. IF YOU ARE A FAKE, KNOCK THAT SHIT OFF, BITCH!  Less on this story, sooner.
