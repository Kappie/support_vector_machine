Now, most people are not going to want to leave their cell phone in a bowl and out of their reach, let alone in a bowl mixed with other strange phones carrying God only knows what diseases. So one would be led to believe the implication is that we wish you to turn you cell phone off before entering. BUT...that's not what the sign says. Clearly, there are two options, including the option to leave the cell phone in the bowl...with no requirement that it be turned off before it is left in the bowl. So you can, in theory, leave your cell phone in the bowl  turned on . And being as this is a public library I can guarantee that at some point some patron will leave their cell phone in the bowl,  turned on . And naturally, that someone will try to call this clever patron while their phone is in this bowl of phones. And that, upon hearing it ringing, the circulation staff member currently occupying the counter will rush to the bowl and begin cursing frantically as they dig through phones and aquarium rocks to determine which of the phones in the bowl is ringing.  In truth I am not entirely opposed to this plan, as I welcome all arrangements that produce amusement in their absurdity, and the failure of the arranger to be aware of all natural outcomes of their action. It is my fondest wish to see this particular outcome before I leave.
