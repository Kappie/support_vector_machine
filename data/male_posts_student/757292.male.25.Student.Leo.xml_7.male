I blame the "Reading Week" break for knocking me off my scholastic track, in combination with all the technological distractions around me, and my procrastinating personality.   Currently there are two papers that I must write. I have all the necessary information placed in a relatively logical order, but I cannot find the motivation to put this knowledge into my own words. All the pieces are there, but I don't want to put together these puzzles. Putting together that Lord of the Rings 3D puzzle at Toys R Us on Boxing Day was more than enough puzzling for me. I got home around 2pm and it's going on 9 hours later, but I only have 2 paragraphs to show for myself. I'd like to credit this success to my laptop, my television, my PS2, and NCAA College Football 2004 (where I set a record for sacking the opposing quarterbacks 102 times in one season with one player). Call me Brody, but this ain't Mallrats.  So I could have finished a lot of things with my time, but I didn't. It makes me feel like a failure in a sense because I was highly motivated while taking the bus home from school this afternoon. Then it all died. I'm more of a thinker than a person who makes actions happen. This I have to deal with.   That's the technological distraction. Where the technological depression comes in. I'm not exactly sure. For one thing, I think it started around 8:30 this morning on a completely different note. I try to sit near the front of the class in the Contemporary Europe course because I figure it keeps me away from the people who aren't there to pay complete attention to the lectures. This nerdy guy and girl always position themselves near me, and as the days pass, they speak to each other louder and louder during lectures. I wish I could turn my ear off, or focus it so I can only hear the professor, but instead I pick up every sound in the room. Especially them. I shot them the "evil eye" twice, and a guy one row in front of us did the same, but to no avail. I asked them if they would keep it down, but that only worked for 37 seconds before they started laughing. I didn't know imperial expansion in Europe was funny. It was especially hilarious when all the Asians were slaughtered in the Boxer Rebellion during the early 1900s, wasn't it? So that was the first spark towards lighting my match today.  The second spark came during a philosophy class. I sat in my usual seat with two empty seats to my right. Halfway through the class, some girl came in late and sat in the chair two seats away. Overall, the class focuses on the professor giving us lots of time to attempt random examples of reasoning and logic. After about 2 minutes, people start talking about random bullshit. I got really drunk last night. Me too. I love your hair. You like my new bag too? Oh thanks so much. My boyfriend broke up with me over the phone after 6 years of dating. Can you believe it? Today the late girl called her friend's name (she was sitting two rows in front of us) and she proceeded to turn around to talk in a language foreign to me. I could tell they were talking about my laptop bag which I had sitting on the other empty desk because the classroom was mostly deserted today. Instead of the girl in the row closest to the front moving her things off the empty desk beside her, they asked me to move my things so her friend could come over. I agreed and asked them if they would please not talk too loud because I have trouble concentrating. That didn't work. For the next 10 minutes they talked and laughed with each other in the language foreign to me. When the professor walked by, they pretended to be discussing the work, but obviously they weren't doing that the whole time. I mean, the example we were examining revolved around nuclear holocaust. How could anyone be laughing at that? I'm venting. Basically I don't understand why people must be so distracting in places of learning. If you're there to socialize, you obviously can do that elsewhere.   As one might be able to tell, at this point, I wasn't happy with people. This is where the technological depression sets in. Some guy pulls out one of his 2-way radio/walkie talkie things in class and starts having a conversation with a friend somewhere else nearby. Annoying as that is, it was made more annoying by the horrible beeping noises that occur after every message is sent or received. Also, why is it necessary to use a device like that to make plans with your friend in the middle of a class. Can't people wait a few minutes for class to be over, and discuss these things in person? I have the same gripe with cellphones.  Speaking of which, on the bus ride home, some guy was nice enough to be talking on his cell phone very loudly. Fine, it's a public bus and you can do what you want, but do you really need to let everyone else hear your conversation? It was the most pathetic attempt at conversation too. First he calls his friend to ask, "Yo, did I leave my wallet there last night? You sure? Don't lie to me. A'ight. Well I'm gonna be there in 10 minutes so be ready to go." Phone call #2 occurs a couple minutes later. "Hey. Check on top of the fridge. I think it's up there. You sure? If you're lying I'm gonna kick your ass. Yeah whatever. Peace." Phone call #3. 5 minutes later. "What's up? I'm just about to get off the bus so meet me outside. What? You ain't ready yet? What's taking you so long? Fuck man! I wanted to get this shit done so we could get high before work. A'ight, well just hurry up man. Cya." Did one really need to make all those phone calls to the same person within the span of a few minutes? Was it really that necessary to spew out those sentence fragments for everyone else to hear, or could you have waited?   I'm getting more and more lost here. Overall, it has been one of those days where I'm thinking way too much, finding all kinds of flaws and problems, not getting enough done, and getting depressed for no reason. The only things I decided are:  1] I really need to train my ear to selectively hear certain things. 2] Now that my education is finally broadening my horizons, I need to put it to good use. 3] I need to get these papers done. 4] I'd like to play a game of pick-up basketball or softball to get my body going and to feel alive. Fresh air, sweat, and physical contact.  5] I really want to watch Curb Your Enthusiasm.
