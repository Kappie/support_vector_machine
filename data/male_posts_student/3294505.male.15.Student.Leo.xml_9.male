People I know, if I choose to keep my lazy ways, will probably never see me again, or not until the end of summer. I gotta get off my lazy ass and start hangin out more, I think.   On that note, before turning this into a rant, I've decided to restart work on this game I'm programming with RPGMaker. It seems simple enough, the game that is...and the programming is a sinch. But since the whole work is a bunch of works in progress at once, it's hard to get much done when your story is only so far, or the music is only half done.  But eventually, the job'll get done. I hope. God I want popeye's chicken.
