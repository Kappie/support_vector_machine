Grarrrg, then he was like "Are you thinking about being like that''and then told him no and he gave Mike like a big hug and was like "Thank you thank you thank you"  Then, I was as queer as a golden quarter, or something what is that frickin' phrase?  Anyways stupid man!  OOOOOHHHHHH, Guess what, guess what?  *bounces*  Doug just got accepted to the Univeristy of Missouri at Rolla.  Did you know that it has more of their graduates get into NASA than any other university!  Sweet stuff for him!  I am sure that rock his socks.com. So, anyways last might I was hit on amd proposed over the interent by some Muslim in Egypt. It was like sooo gross!  Boo! on that guy.
