One girl's blog was a quest to lose 120 lbs. by 2005, thats interesting...1 guy'z blog was makin a movie and his adventures in cali since he lived in michigan...interesting...so yeah, most of these blogz aren't jus journals of pplz, its basically a search or a way to express themselves to share wit others...minez use to b like that, i dont think anybody other than oxnard ppl read my blog...but yeah, my search is over, and now i jus use this blog to type up what i did today and what not, and what my feelinz r, and how much i love my g/f...yup, pretty boring stuff if u ask me...and y do u ppl read the stuff that i write...who knowz...but don't worry folkz...someday the saga will come back again, then all the drama and other shit will start and then this damn blog will have a purpose once again...but right now, im jus gonna enjoy life and enjoy it wit my special g/f and the other ppl who are a great part of my life...maybe i should start a blog seein if i can gain 120 lbs. by 2005, haha, that would b really really interesting then...but i can, cuz yeah, vball makez me lose the weight once or if i gain it...if u have any ideas how to make my blog seem interesting jus e-mail me at ckeer3@hotmail.com or jus tag up my board or something...but right now i guess its pretty borin stuff to u ppl...but yeah...jus hollar...payce!
