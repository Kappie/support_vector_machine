Fair enough, ye all say. Never mind.  I got a new jumper in town today... oh, speaking of town, I bumped into Lisa yesterday, but she wasn't sure it was me. Why? I forgot what the word was for "hello". I got a bit stuck as a result. Silly me -_-. Lisa's one of these people that I think if I knew better, we'd be very good friends. Maybe not. I don't honestly know, but it's nice to say, isn't it? Yeah ^^.  The 3-night run of Pirates of Penzance begins tomorrow.... eee. And on Thursday I've got the audition for the award scheme... eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. S-h-i-t. Jon's nervy. M'aider!  Hm, methinks Sally is slowly cottoning on to the fact that I like her in that way... mee, if anything she's talking to me more. She just seems awkward. Rachel actually seems to be afraid of me, in that really cute way when they respect you but don't particularly want to talk to you. ^^. They're both great singers. And they're nice. Ruth isn't such a great singer but she's still quite friendly. Albeit intensely odd.  I've got to do assorted courseworks... lame.  I'm also tired.  Still missing Zoe and Rhiannon, waah.
