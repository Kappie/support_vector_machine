Managed to spend time with some of the guys, seeing as how their school terms have ended and they too are pretty much free at the moment. Of course all this going out and eating out is a drain on resources that I am trying to conserve. But seeing as how I'm only free, more or less, this week, I guess it's ok to indulge. Next week onwards I can let my bank, as well as my friend's pockets, take a break.    >   Noticed that my posts are always too damn long. If I post more regularly I guess I won't have this problem. Anyway, I shall focus on movies, in this case one in particular.  Caught  X-Men 2  early in the week and once again I am presently surprised as the franchise takes superhero movies in another step up. The first one re-introduced to people a type of comic book based movie that is intelligent, deep and mature.  This latest release in the series expands on that by balancing pace with characterization and yet allowing the key roles to shine. The actors do a better job here and now seem more comfortable and relaxed, even the new ones. This is a trend that I hope is maintained for the next round of movies.   Interestingly enough, all these new movies are all from Marvel, which is strange to me because the reasons that I seem to have that compels me to prefer DC comics over Marvel comics are the same as the ones stated above. Which makes one wonder how much better movies could be made from a DC license. But in the end I guess, it all depends on the writer and the director. However, it is not an easy job for them. Comic books usually have a lot of history and changes in them since they are such long lasting series. In some way I guess the writers are hampered by the history. What to leave in? What to throw out? And what to change?  I hope that this level of chair and respect for source material not only continue in movies for comic books but for any work based on another work from a different medium, be it books-to-TV or movies-to-computer games. Don't just follow, copy or port over blindly, but tell the hidden story, fill in the gaps, use what was thrown out. Respect the story in all it's forms and consumers will respect it as well.    >   I (of course) caught  urlLink The Matrix Reloaded  over this weekend. More than once actually. Will share some thoughts about it tomorrow.
