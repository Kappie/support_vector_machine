Why, I ask, do we, in the age of credit cards and PayPal, still carry around little copper circles in our pocket? Isn't there a better way? And then there is CoinStar, the 9 percent stealing pieces of shit at your local grocery store. 9 percent is an absolutely unacceptable interest rate. If anyone ever charged me 9 percent for something, I would tell them to shove their 9 percent in a special place, yet when faced with pounds and pounds of excess metallic circles, it seems quite reasonable. Why?
