For those of you who haven't seen The Big Lebowski, seriously reevaluate your life . . .  No, I'm just kidding . . .   Not really. . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   No, really, I'm not kidding, go reevaluate your life.  Anyway, getting back to what's important, today I realized something. I am a lot less like the dude than I want to be and than I thought I was. I am not cool, I am not relaxed, I don't "fit right in there", I am not "the right man for my time and place". I am not "The dude". Now, that's not very useful information for all of you, but here's where it gets useful. It led to me thinking about everyone else around me and even those who aren't around me. It hit me, none of us are the dude. Yes, I know, it hurts to hear it but think about all the things that make the dude unique and compare it to you and you'll see that I'm right. You don't "fit right in there", you're not the "right man" for your time and place, you're not the dude.  If you doubt it, that's cool, just think about it more and you'll realize that I'm right. And in the end, whether you are the dude or not is just like my opinion, man.  Alright, moving on, I got invited by extension of the Stevens' to the Tom Kaisers' house for memorial day. They're so always so cool and gracious about my being there. I hope I can make it up to them sometime. Always hospitable, always gracious, always... good. I want to be more like them in a lot of ways. I'll be workin' on it for a while now. Anyway, it was just us, like 4 other people and the Tom Kaisers. Before that, on Sunday, I went to mass at TAC as usual and enjoyed it. Megan was there but didn't get to stay long at all; just for like half an hour. Nope, Maria Krestyn wasn't there, but that wasn't the bulk of my reason for going to mass like it used to be. She doesn't show up for Sunday mass anymore during the summer, which is a real bummer for me, but it's not like I'll stop going to mass, as I said earlier. I don't do anything that I'm not pushed into half-assed. Since I'm becoming a catholic, I'm gonna be going all the way, communion, that thing after that, confirmation, that other thing after that, and ya know, the whole thing, fun and not-fun.  I think Megan doesn't just not like me, but actually DISLIKES me. I hope it wasn't anything I did or said. i.e. I hope it was something my family did that reflected badly upon me.  Oh, and I took my 5th practice SAT today. I didn't like how it went. I was forced to omit like 28 questions total, which pisses me off. I have the real thing in like 4 days and I have to get a half-decent score. I hate that thing with such passion that I want to blow up the moon. Yeah, I know it would throw off some kinda solstice thing but I don't really care. Anyway, next couple days will be pure math pain. Sigh.  Ok, what else, I wore really ugly clothes that didn't match at all and I hung out with Peter a bunch and I ate some food and drank a Jamba Juice and ate some breakfast bars and watched the big lebowski and part of the lord of the rings the return of the king and played some command and conquer 95 edition and im'd some people with my sidekick and talked to Kat (she's cool (and pretty)) and got some good words from Ali and listened to Built to Spill and Modest Mouse and came home and watched some red vs blue and cursed at some slow speed internet connection action and yelled at my sister for whining about me not studying (of all people. yeah, i know). Anyway, that wasn't written in any particular order. It was just what I did that came to my mind that I've done in the past few days. So, concluding my long run-on sentence, I will start another because I forgot some stuff. I also practiced my guitar and I'm learning Big Dipper and I'm practicing everything and I went to see JMs grave and I cried to myself and I miss JM and whenever I see a picture of him I hope he didn't die and sometimes I try and make myself believe that he's happier now and that it's worth my suffering and I hate it when people die so don't die because I'll hate it unless I hate you, in which case I'll thank the good lord above :-P. Have a nice night and a pleasant and safe tomorrow.  In conclusion, the fish will swim and the man will talk. The cow will walk and the dog will do tricks. None of that has anything to do with anything. Bye.          -- Feanor.
