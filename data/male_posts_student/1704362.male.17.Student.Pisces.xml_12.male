HEAR: The RYTHMIC sounds of native percussion, or "Jack-Hammers" TASTE: The EXOTIC culinary delights of the Pennington cafeteria, featuring mold growths for health and flavor!  AND MORE!  A lukewarm 95-degree Pennington dawn. You're woken up by a loud cowbell outside your room at 4:30 AM. Do you enjoy constantly feeling like you were just hit by a train? Does the idea of writhing in agony after taking discolored, expired Bufferin pain medication excite and thrill you? And, to complete the package, how about having to run five miles?   IF SO, Pennington Cross-Country Camp is the Place Where It's At!   Get out. Get out before it's too late. I beg you.   End Transmission.
