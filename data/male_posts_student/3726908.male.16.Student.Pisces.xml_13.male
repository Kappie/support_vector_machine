I have only bought Japanese album and never would expect to buy an album of other languages despite being more literate in Chinese and English. Well, I have never regreted my choice of buying this F.I.R, a new band that received many top awards for their first album, this is the band which broke my tradition of listening to purely J-Pop.  An album with two introductory songs, one instrumental karaoke version tune and ten superb songs, it is an album which I definitely recommend (to those speaking chinese anyway...). The songs can satisfy verious moods, ranging from the fast moving "Light" to the sweet melodic "You Make Me Want To Fall In Love." Each song has an infectious tune that could make one sing along to it after hearing it for just a few times.  Something special which I heard in this album is that there is a rather heavy J-Pop base to it. Almost every song have a strong and heavy bass which is rather familiar to the English pop band "Evanescenes" and J-Pop band "Do As Infinity." One thing that prevented this album from scoring full marks is the lyrics. The lyrics are raher repitative, which I notice is a small problem with all Taiwanese songs.  But no doubt, it's a very good album.  Song by Song Review:  The first song...not really a song, it's an intro, an intro inspired from the movie "The Beach" (As they said in their album) It first plays a feel of nature like birds chirping, soon followed by voices from the three person in the band. After that, a great rock and solid tune finishes the piece. The second part is identical to one of Ayumi Hamasaki's song, showing the band's songs closely related to J-Pop.  "Fly Away", this song is surely one of the better songs in the album. It has a very infectious flow and absorbs the listener to sing along "Fly Away..."  "Lydia", this song can be said to be, in my opinion, the best song in this album. It's not only infectious but also a rather moody song. Having this great melancholy tune, it can easily stir the feelings of the listener.  "Song of Wanderers" or "Rurouni no Uta" as I liked to say...I can't help but wonder why isn't this song included as one of their publicized songs. The song is once again, addictive but it also includes this slight tribal feel to it which complements with the overall mood of this song. Highly recommended.  "Our Love", I love this song very much. Not only is the lyrics great, not only is the tune superb, this song is also a proof of how powerful the lead singer, Faye's voice can be. The overall mood is slow but nicely coordinated and portrayed. Added with an addictive rhythm, one of the better songs in this album this is.  "Light", this song unlike the others, have a very cheerful mood and a fast moving rhythm, very suitable for lifting the depressing mood off. However, this song doesn't have as much "grabbing" power as the rest.  Song number 6 is an instrumental version of "Lydia" played using only the piano. Nice and soft, makes a great karaoke to the song "Lydia".  "Your smile", a song in my opinion rather similar to "Light" in terms of mood and feel. But it has added a slight Afro essence to it which complements great with the song, thus making this song unique in it's own fashion.  Song 9, "Tarot cards". This song challenges on the voal prowess of Faye. Not the power but the flexibility on the singer. The lyrics are really well made and it even rhymes at times. You can hear on how sharply Faye changes her pitch in this song. It has a mysterious feel and brings to the peak of this song, catching the attention of listeners. Faye's voice is the main focus in this song.  "Fairyland", one of the more soft and light song in this album. It shows of the band's ability to be able to adapt with heavy and light songs. Not bad in my opinion.  "Revolution", an extreme and fast paced song. The heaviest song in this album, it eludes the strength of singer/guitarist Real and once again the power of Faye. It contains an enraged tune and is rather infectious. Don't worry though, it won't make one go furious. ^^  Song 12, the second soft and light song in this album, slightly similiar to "Fairyland", Faye's voice turns gentle and smoothing, added with a sweet and melodic rhythm, a great song for couples.  The last song, is actually an ending for this album but an intro for their next album. The guitar and keyboard is the main element here. Well placed in my opinion.  Overall, when hearing this album, it's as if the album is trying to relate a story to the listeners. It plays with the hearer's emotion and feelings with their widely ranged and placed songs. The songs are addictive and the tune would stick in your head for sometime after listening to it. Great album...and it's their first!  Extra: Although not much mentioned, Ian the keyboardist and producer of this band planned the whole thing for F.I.R for almost 2 years. He can be said to be the founder of the band as well...So to say, without him, there's no F.I.R.  Songs Recommended: Lydia, Song of Wanderers, Our Love, Your smile, You Make Want To Fall In Love.  F.I.R consist: Lead vocal - Faye Producer/keyboardist - Ian Guitar - Real  Score: 4.5/5
