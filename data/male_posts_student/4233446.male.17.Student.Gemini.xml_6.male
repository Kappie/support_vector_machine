Thank whatever higher power there is that I was sleeping lightly last night and happened to wake up at 5:40.  So, I was only ten minutes late to work, but of course I still got bitched at for twenty minutes by my manager.  Four hours later, I pull my shoulder out of place for the umpteenth time since I started working there and had to yank that back into place and continue working.  Yeah, fun.  About half an hour later I pull a muscle in my leg.  So now my shoulder is killing me and my leg hurts like hell.  To top it all off, about twenty minutes after pulling a muscle, I twist my ankle and drop a table on my foot in the process.  So I'm in a fair amount of pain right now.  That's just what's physically wrong.  I woke up this morning and was hit with an overwhelming sense of lonliness, like there's no one in my life anymore.  I feel like I'm gonna be trapped in this place forever and never see anyone that I care about again.  It seems like everything's grey again, like I'll never know love or any good feeling.  I thought I was over this shit.  It's been a good four months since the last time I felt this way, since I felt depressed and lost.  But here I am again, here I am and this time there's really no one who cares anymore.  I feel like there's nothing left for me.  Right now, I just want to die.
