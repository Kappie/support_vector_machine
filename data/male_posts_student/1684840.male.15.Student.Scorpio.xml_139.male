Wow, the weather today was so great, it was hard to believe we were in England (Roll on leaving day! Hehe).  We got our tickets and then went to Farmfoods and Home Bargains to get stuff to eat in the cinema, then afterwards, shoved the stuff in our pockets and we all looked fat lmao.  We got into the cinema (almost sweating after the exposure to the bloody hot weather, which was now starting to get on our nerves) and got some seats to the right of the screen, then moves so we were a bit in-line.  The film was based on a kind of Dracula, Dr. Frankenstien, warewolf and old legend style stories all merged into one cool story.  The SFX were amazing too, and because it was a dark and dingy film, it seemed really cool in the cinema.   I can't wait to do it again sometime.  We might go and see The Day After Tomorrow and Harry Potter 3 when they come out.  Might go and see Shrek 2 as well   {:D} DONKEH!
