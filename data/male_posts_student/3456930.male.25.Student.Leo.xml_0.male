I do have a home here in Newcastle, but I no longer have a "Home" (with a capital H). I no longer have a place that I know is intrinsically mine. Some place where I KNOW I can go to anytime. Day or night.  My parents have moved and they are selling the house that has been a part of my life for the last 13 years. Yeah yeah, so what? You may ask. It's not like it's your ancestral home or anything. It's not like it's been in your family for X amount of generations. Yes, that IS true but it still doesn't stop the fact that I have developed a sentimental attachment to it. Sure, it's only a brick and mortar house. But some of my most defining moments of my life have happened in that house. It was the place where I threw my first party. Where my friends would come 'round to visit and hang out. Where I admitted my feelings to my 'first true love'. It's the memories that go along with that little 3 bedroom place in Calala. On top of that, it's the first time I've ever lived somewhere that wasn't rented. It was our (my) home. And now some fuckhole strangers are gonna move in and it's no longer going to be mine.  So I no longer have a home. Once my parents buy a house in Grafton it'll be weird because I'll have no idea where it will be and it'll all be new and crap. I'll be a stranger in a strange town.  Hmmm... that'd make a good movie. All I'd need would be a motorcycle and a shotgun....   Lowman X, out.   Listening to: "Lateralus" - Tool.
