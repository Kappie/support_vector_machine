Today was lined up: hit golf balls, get CD, get documentary VHS dub, eat a dirty lunch at the dirty Panda Express, get some bank stuff straightened out, and be out.  By noon.  90 minutes later, I'm in the midst of a grand game of grabass at my least favorite coffee shop in town, Java Express.  My 20 ounce Oak Farms Orange Juice sits on the table, unopened, sweating, anticipating its appropriated demise.  Lay in wait, little OJ.  Your death will not be in vain; instead it will go towards my faux health diet, establishing a conscious allotment of fruit for the day, and establishing cultural capital with other health nuts.  Though Odwalla is respected more; Oak Farms makes me look like a cheap bastard.    From Dushyanth S., Amazon.com's customer service representative:   I've checked into your Amazon.com account and found that the current balance on your gift certificate is $20.00.    To view your gift certificate balance, click the "Your Account" link in the top right corner of our web site.  Under Payment Settings, click the option to "View gift certificate balance" and sign in with your e-mail address and password.  The following page will display your unused gift certificate funds.    When you place your next order, on the payment section of our online order form, you should see that the gift certificate funds have been automatically applied to your order.  If this is not the case, make sure the radio button is selected under the words "You have $xx.xx in gift certificates or promotional credit available for use toward this purchase.  Would you like to apply it?" We will then apply the balance in your gift certificate account.  You do not need to enter your claim code again, as it has already been redeemed.   In case I forgot what I did to use my gift certificate, I was kindly reminded!  Maybe the first time was a stroke of luck that I followed instructions and applied my gift certificate to the order.  Anyway, at the end, our service industry friend let me know why I didn't use my gift certificate...I bought something from Amazon that didn't take gift certificates.     I have also summarized the Fine Print associated with our gift certificates below my signature to assist you further.   Ahh, to own a gift certificate that you must use on a specific product.  I know it's going to make me buy condoms and douche.   I left Austin in January 2002 due to circumstance of others; it turned out to be a nice move, and refreshing to get out of the toil of the workaday life in a city where my social life revolved around the Arboretum Starbucks and Mocha John, Make-up Shanah, and Quad Latte Christine.  Leaving was fine; I needed money, and I could make a smidgen of it in Arlington.  I knew I would be back; getting into UT seemed quite likely, and while I didn't get into the program of my choice, the end result is no different.  And now, as I look at Dean Keaton/Medical Arts, watching people cross to the Fine Arts Complex in a similar fashion to the girl I knew from the past and scampered to hide from as she looked my way, I start to miss Austin.   Not the Mo-Pac, not the pestering for pocket change, and not the woman who is in such a hurry to get to Starbucks that she honks as I slowly pull into a parking space too tight for my compact...the city isn't too beautiful, it's hot, and there's too much ego for a place this small.  Yet I don't want to leave.  I'd be to Giddings otherwise.  I want to sit in the coffee shop, sip an Americano, take notes for my ode to Ms. Pac-Man, look over my fantasy baseball team, and play extreme amounts of grabass when reading the blogs of others, knowing I can get up and head back to the apartment for a game of Ball or a dirty nap.  I can do this in other cities, and I'll enjoy it once I'm there.  I'm not ready to go just yet though.    Driving to the bank, I passed my first Austin apartment; a rottenous 40 unit complex off 31st where the landlady used to ask me for resume advice whilst lounging in her mumu (I wish I could spell that) on a rusted lawn lounge chair.  Walking out of the apartment was the first woman I saw when I moved to Austin in June 2001, a short, leather-skinned woman in her late 50s, sporting a backpack and comfortable shoes.  She reminded me of my mother (short and comfy shoes, not leathery skin) in that she was older and living in an apartment, a fate I wish on no one outside of a bustling metropolis.  When I moved, I forgot about this woman who was always up at 10 am, walking out of Apartment 14, backpack on, doing the stoop shuffle on the path by the palm tree and to the back door.    I ran into her today as we were passing DoubleDave's on Duval...part of the path from the backdoor to her destination, a destination I don't know.
