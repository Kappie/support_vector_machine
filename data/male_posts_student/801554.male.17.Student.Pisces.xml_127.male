I was brought up to be a Roman Catholic, attended Catholic school for several years, and my high school is Catholic. And we're required to take religion classes. This year is morality. My teacher is a priest, and every class I find myself directly opposed to much of what he is teaching. I honestly can't figure out why. Why, even though I was brought up very similarly to my classmates, do I disagree with much of the canon?  Personally, I think there are not moral absolutes. I believe in a personal God, but only to some extent. I believe we are accountable for what we do on Earth, but not to an extreme degree, such as eating meat on some days (as I write this on Ash Wednesday). I believe in a God who works through evolution, who started the big bang, and programmed the universe in much the same way as a computer programmer programs an application, with parameters we haven't figured out yet, but we will. Whenever I'm asked to give my religion on a form or something such, I check the box marked "other". I am, to some degree, and agnostic. A member of the church of the free thinker.  But I attend church every Sunday. I even usher. Why?  I can't figure it out.  Oh, well. It's not that important.
