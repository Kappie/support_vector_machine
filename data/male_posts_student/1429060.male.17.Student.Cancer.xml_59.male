Pre-Calculus test was actually somewhat fun, but the AP Bio test (open book) was rather difficult, and the AP English Hemingway test was hell, despite who may argue it. Three tests, in total. But they are gone, and my economics report is finished, and I am free (except for the PSAT, which will destroy my mind utterly).  My grandparents have a new rat dog. They want me to come over and name him/her/it.  At Rhodes, I wrote this really creepy piece of poetry, becuase it has a lot to do with suicide, and I found myself rather afraid as I realized I wondered about how much a slit wrist would hurt. But here's the odd piece about it:   Metal splinter  My hands are dragging me into a kitchen In some unknown home I built Overnight, while I was sleeping And my mind was working furiously Eyes burning in REM chaos, again, again, Trying to wake up twice, once from the slumber Twice, from the half-reality I have Assumed to be mine, and my fingers are itching To reach for the wall near the toaster To grasp the wood of a straightedge Knife, sword, blade, keen bright metal And wondering what it feels like when blood When life drips out on the stone floor Impatiently waiting… For the wonderful, ethereal euphoria that comes When the waves smother the breath When the snow freezes the veins When the mind begins to drift Because the body has no real purpose anymore No, my wrist has no eye of blood yet I have a sliver Gone to get a bandage (it won’t stop the cut).   As I said, somewhat unnerving. But I spoke to Alanna about these weird thoughts, and she reassured me that I was not insane, I was simply teen-age. Rather comforting.  Full weekend of hell ahead. Cheers, mortals.
