So i go and we start just me and him and this  was ALOT of dirt. It wasn't too difficult when we first started because  the dirt wasn't clayish or anything it was good and reletavley easy to  move. So about 15-20 minutes into it, the sky desides to drop some rain  on our heads for us, this wasn't bad but then it began to pick up and  rain hevaly. So we coverd the pile up the best we could and waited a  while. We come outside and the sun is beeming and ionno if u ever  expierienced the humitity in New Orleans but damn. So this went on and  we finished in the 4-5 hours and im tired. So ima go see I, ROBOT  tonight and i'll let yall know how it is.
