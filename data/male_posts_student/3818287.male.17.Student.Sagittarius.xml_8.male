But I've lived with it for 17 years, I'm sure I can last one more. Not much going on here, last night me and bunch of my homies/posse/crew watched Oceans 11 (the new one). It's a really good movie, very well done. Umm, I've done a lot of fireworks lately. Not the crappy sparkler type stuff. Oh no, we're finishing off the leftovers from last summers trip to Wyoming. Lots of good concerts coming up soon. Let's see, some on my list include Warped Tour, Reel Big Fish, The Hives, Fall Out Boy, Finch, and last but not least Less Than Jake. Of course I'm going to need to take out a second mortgage but I think it's worth it. Umm, not much else to say. My family is going out of town on Wednesday for a week, so you what that means: Party, my house, be there! Go check out www.AcclaimedPunk.com, losta news being added by yours truly. I'm bummed because I have to work today, but it's only for a couple hours. How I hate that job, let me count the ways (this could take a while)....  Ta-ta for now,  Chris  P.S. Almost forgot my Word of Wisdom for today! "Nothing is illegal as long as you don't get caught"
