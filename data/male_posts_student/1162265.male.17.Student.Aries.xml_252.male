I think Spike Lee even had one of the guys from it in Bamboozled.  They were talking about Bush's middle east policy today, and they started talking about my boy Mommar Al-Gaddaffi. The current coolest Arab/African leader (he is clearly an ethnic Arab).  They were talking about how the rest of the Arab world marginalizes Palestine, and how that's causing alot of sides to fragment over one Arab state.  Big things.
