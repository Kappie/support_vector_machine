All prepared and ready to go, we hail for a cab and made our way down to NUS with all her barang barang. Dad didn’t come with us because there were only three invitations and my dad doesn’t really like to dress up. Oh well, I got to know why Lao Er laughed when I reach there. All the graduates were in white shirt/blouse and black pants, boy do I fit in. Hehehe… The ceremony was about to begin, so she went to change into her graduation gown as we made our way into the hall. What luck we had, to be seated at the center 3rd row from the stage. Nothing much I’ll say, it was like any graduation with a lot of applause (the usual stuff). There were some funny grandaunts with silly actions that brought laughter out of the applauses. The ceremony  ended with balloons and pieces of paper coming down from the very top of the hall, so grand sia.   Alright out of the hall, I was being pulled around by Lao Er just because I was her cameraman. Went around the engine faculty taking photos, some of them were totally silly. When that is done, she took off her gown and Toa PaYoh we went. First, I was asked to open up another saving account when I accompanied Lao Er to withdraw money. Then there was this uncle who sited next to me in Crystal Jade Toa PaYoh who asked if I’m from the NTU Fag. Do I really look that old? I’m still a poly student for goodness sake! Thankx Lao Er for her treat. When around the shops there and got myself a pear of ‘Banana’ shoes before we head back home. ARhh… REST TIME..
