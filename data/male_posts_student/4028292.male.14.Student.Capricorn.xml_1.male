Then after that i ripped it up in the mosh pit , but the best part of the concert was definatly Slipknot......They played last and they played for like an hour and 15 minutes! During slipknot i must've went crowed surfing like 30 times it was insane!!!!! Those guys went crazy on stage and they said they will be back to Oregon very soon because it's there favorite spot to play.....The concert went on for 10 hours throughout the day , oh yeah and SLAYER was there , and i got home around 1 in the mourning then came home and watched some t.v. then went to bed........that was the concert , glad i didn't die!
