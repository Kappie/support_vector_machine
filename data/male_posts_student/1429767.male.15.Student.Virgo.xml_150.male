In return I got two disconnected numbers (my friend and his parents) and a very cryptic voice message prompt paired with an unreturned call (his friend). I just don't know anymore. Over the past week I have read many b/n's and board posts wishing me sympathies and offering advice and I thank everyone that offered their condolences and otherwise. I finally made the phone calls, but I am afraid that I was too late. Maybe his friend will call me back, not that it means I will learn of his whereabouts; maybe his friend won't, and…I'll just have to get on with my life.  I don't throw around phrases like 'soul mate' or 'the one', that level of romanticism just doesn't work for me. I don't know why, I just can't work with it. It's too permanent, final, narrow. I have thought about all of this a lot recently since I vented my heart's frustrations and I am still against using those kinds of terms. I won't say that he was 'the one'. Why would I do that to myself? Unfortunately, as much as I want to see him again, my inability to abandon reality (that whole logic has its limits conundrum) I'm afraid that I may have to come to the realization that I may never see him again. If I were to label him 'the one' and I don't see him again, that would leave quite a void to fill down the road. 'The one' is so final. I cannot do that to myself.  There are circumstances which I cannot discuss here, things I know about certain lifestyles and choices, that I have to take into consideration. And these things constantly remind me that as much as I love him I cannot spend my life wishing. The cynic in me rears its ugly head again.  I love him. But I have to come to terms with the idea that I may never see him again. I never could grasp the hopeless romantic ideals. I fell in love. It didn't work. I got my heart broken. It happens. It happened. It will probably happen again. But, there is life after love; there will always be life after love.  I'm sure that a lot of people will feel that I have given up, or that I didn't love him in the first place. People can think what they want; only I know what it is I feel. I cannot hold on forever, I can still love him (and perhaps love will fade with time, perhaps not) but I cannot lie to myself anymore. As I write this, it hurts, but I know that the longer you hold onto something the harder it is to let it go. Considering the way I feel now I am confident that if I try to cling to this any longer I may not be able to let it go. And where would that leave me? I don't even want to think about it.  So now begins the process of getting on with my life. It's not about forgetting, it would never be about forgetting. It's about remembering what we had when we were together. It's about remembering how the song he wrote for me sounded. Remembering his face. Being able to smile when I hear his favorite song. Remembering hours of driving around in the Benz obsessively changing CD's to make the perfect play list. Remembering what it was like to lie in his arms and watch the perfect sunset and scan the horizon for dolphins in the dark. Sometimes I still feel his hand on the small of my back…a tangible reminder of memories turned landmines." -paLmtreeundOne   That was a really good article i read on bolt.com tell me what you think, i think it was really meaningful and just plain awesome...
