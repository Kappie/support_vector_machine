Today after working for about an hour winning championships with my uber pimped out Mustang Cobra, I saved enough (352,000 to be exact) to buy an Italian masterpiece. The Zonda C12S, is ridiculous.  It certainly can't be legal to drive on city streets, because attaching a V2 rocket onto the back of a civic has about the same effect. (Though the Zonda looks much cooler then a civic with a rocket attached to it, yes i mean it.)  I know I must be tired when I'm talking about cars.  It's a good thing no one reads my site...I hope.
