How cool is that gonna look.  well nothing much has happend to me in the past few weeks i am still of course single and looking but i'll probally never find a person who is interested in me. Oh well(Has A Quiet Sob) well back to my manly ness and is still un able to spell or use grammer yay!!!!!! well i'm still macho as ever cause i dont want people to know my feelings although i occasionly let them out but all is good cause i'm A Sensitive New Age Guy searching for a Sensitive New Age Girl but who knows if i'll ever find that special one. i might have to start making money so i can um err..........Go out yes that it go out to pubs but i'm not old enough for that oh well 2 years away then i can drink in pubs yay!!!!!!   life hits you in strange i relised the other day is that i have no clue what i am gonna do when i finnish school i'm just not sure what is gonna happen to me maybe i could apply to be a full time bum cause geee is that hard work always feeling tired sometimes getting back cramps but its all good if you love the passion of what your doing.  if i were to ever get a job i would wnat it in either the film industrie or the computing/electrical world.for some reason i seem to be the best in my media studies class at making little films for our projects to work on plus i also seem to be the best at useing the technology so much as its gotten me more work to do in class.. i've now relised that i want to buy a digital video camera cause i love making movies and editing them i just find it so much fun i also like directing them and for some reason being in them not that i would rather be behind the camera but who knows what'll happen to me i just hope its something i like.  so heres to the future..
