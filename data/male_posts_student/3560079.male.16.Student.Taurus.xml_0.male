Because it's always like that, Nukezone, everbody played it, manager zone, everybody, and Gunbound of course. I wonder why it's allways like that. Someone starts with it, someother thinks it's kinda cool and starts to play it too. And soon it is like an evil circle and before you know, the whole school is playing it. Then something happens, someone becomes tired of the game, that person goes and says it stinks and that it's just boring. Then suddenly everybody has stopped playing except yourself. All your friends' clans are gone, and how are you to meant survive now? It's just to quit for you too.  Why can't just the people who really thinks it fun play it, and those who don't just stay out of it? Well well...  This game, ouch *knocked my head*, I've written thiss much and not even mentioned the name of the game. It's Priston Tale. This is a MMORPG from Korea, I can't write any inside facts because I haven't played it. Right now, I'm downloading it. That's the biggest downside so far, it's about 500 mb so I would recommend those who have slower than a 0.5 mBit connection to not bother with this game.  From the few screenshots and pictures I've seen it looks good. For you wanna download this game here's the link:  urlLink http://eng.pristontale.com/
