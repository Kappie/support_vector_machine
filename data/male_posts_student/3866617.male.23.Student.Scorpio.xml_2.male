I have been a victim of it since my friend Debra started this online diary thing.  So, I think that I have some issues, and I don't care so much about others reading it, but I just like to get it out of my system.  FIrst of all is my frustration with life at the moment.  It seems as though life has dealt me one which is confusing and also promising simultaniously.  I have too many interests, and where to devote my time is the largest decision that I will ever have too face.  Time is always our hinderence, and it always seems to pass too quickly, which is why I set small goals of anticipation.  I have learned that a mentality of "A watched pot that never boils," can also apply to your life.  Have you ever wanted something so badly and you started working towards getting it?  It seems to take forever to get and when you finally do you have that euphoric state that you dwell in for a while.  Well I have realized that time can be manipulated by using this to our advantage.  Always have a goal to work towards that has great value to you and you alone because not only does the watched bot never boil, but neither does the anticipated moment ever seem to arrive.  This is my satirical view on how to slow down the flow of time, of course everyone with a job realizes that this is hard to do because you want to speed up the time you are at work and then slow it down when you aren't.  I think jobs bring us all down.  Dealing with incompitance, employers and contemporaries and subbordinates, having to perform slightly simular tasks daily in order to have a place to live as well as afford the luxuries that we persue.  I am guilty of these things too.  I work as an employee of a franchize that is owned by a married couple, whom I like.  I also work trying to get my band going as best as I can, and I find myself having to "smooze" alot.  Smooze is my term for "ass-kissing" aka "politicing."  Sadly to say my band job does not afford me enough to pay for rent so I digress and take the other job which I like ok.
