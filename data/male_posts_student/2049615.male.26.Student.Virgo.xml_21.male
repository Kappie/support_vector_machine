If, like me, you were born in the latter half of the 1970s, you were raised at least in part on the very MOR, very inoffensive stylings of Messrs. Daryl Hall and John Oates.  "Private Eyes,"  "Maneater," "Say It Isn't So," and the dreaded "M.E.T.H.O.D. of Modern Love".  These songs, and the very image of Hall  Oates, have come to denote a particular breed of crud.  Blue-eyed soul, as practiced by luminaries from the Righteous Brothers through to Michael Bolton (solo) has always been about proving to the world at large that thirtysomething American white males, even those who sang backup for the Delfonics,  can't stop making the fucking Springsteen face  for thirty seconds while singing, and Hall  Oates have always been at the top of that game.  1977, the year of my birth, was also the year of release of H's classic "Rich Girl".  The ramifications of this are far-reaching.  Growing up, the song was never "new" to me, but due to the vagaries of most normal radio formats at the time it remained in semiregular rotation on most contemporary rock and pop stations;  it was perpetually familiar and as such I ignored it.  A few weeks ago I was screwing around with the radio between Indianapolis and Chicago and I came across it once again.  My initial reaction was bemusement, followed by a degree of shock.  I mean, have you ever listened to the  lyrics ?  My parents were always pretty permissive on the whole "bad words" issue, but to have listened to "Rich Girl" for so long and not picked up the profanities?  Hell, to have not picked up on the whole point of the song?  "Rich Girl" is basically a lecture or a bawl-out delivered to a young woman of the narrator's acquaintance who is using money acquired from either her father or an unrelated older man (ahem) in an evidently unwise and profligate manner, likely on illegal narcotics.  Although naturally it is not delivered with the clarity or force one would expect in the later work of an artist like, for example, Ice-T,  the juxtaposition of the subject matter with such a lite-rock backing track is jarring enough.  Listening now, it is truly surprising that such a track made it under the censor's radar in Reagan's America.
