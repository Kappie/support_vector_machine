People tell me there is this thign going around where they have sexual meanings.  I was clueless, I just wore them cause they were around the house.  Well, I did further research and it turns out there is an uproar about these sex bracelets.  Well, first let me tell you how this all works:  Different colors mean different things.  When you snap a certain color your partner has to perform the sex move, and you each take turns doing this.  Apparently this all started in the 80's and began with Madonna and now is making a comeback.  Adults all over the US are freaking out and some schools are even begining to ban colored bracelets.  This is absurd, I mean, if a kid is gonna have sex, he/she is gonna have sex and it isnt going to be caused by little colored bracelets.  If a kid doesnt want to sex he/she is not going to have sex.  It's that simple.  Bracelets or no bracelets it wont change a thing.  I doubt it is even as widespread as people believe, I bet only a couple kids actual perform this sexcapade (hehe, I made up that word).  This is just another classice example of adults freaking out over nothing.  I think instead of focusing on colored bracelets they should focus on belts worn on pants that are obviously too big for a guy.  Now that is provacative and disgusting.
