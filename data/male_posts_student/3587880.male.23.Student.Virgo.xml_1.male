I've got a ton of reading to do and a bunch of info that I have to digest before I can go onto the next step of things though. Iwas sent a CD ROM full of info on the organization and I need to go through it and fill out some more forms. Forms forms and more forms, that's the life of a prospective member of Team. (For those of you that don't know, "Team" is the short form for what I'll be doing this year. I imagine that I'll be using it frequently in the coming months as I get sucked into the jargon of a new living situation.)   No longer will it be the jargon of school andscience, no mine will be the lingo of a Christian in a small community doing ministry. I say this with some sarcasm and even more dread because I hate it when people assumethat I understandthelanguage they're using when in reality I haven't got a clue and am just too confused to ask for clarification. Yeah I'm really looking forward to becoming  that guy :)
