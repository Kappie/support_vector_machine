The walls glisten with a strange sheen, and one of the characters has a strange, commanding voice.  They agree on something, and the scene ends.  Switch to Chief and crew. Still heading for the comm signal's origin. They notice the bodies aren't as badly mangled here. There are a few trees and shrubs that haven't completely fallen yet. This gives them some hope, showing that the whole world might not have been obliterated.  John sees something sparkling in the distance, giving him chills. The sun doesn't show well through the clouds, making the light suspicious.  The marines complain about having to bring the Grunts along, calling the Earth "The Bad Lands", but Chief knows they are the only source of information he has. There is also a lack of food.  The marines go on and on saying they should stop to look for food, but John knows that nothing would be found. He tells them to set up camp for a rest.  The Grunts go to find more rebreathers, as the ones they are using have begun to run out of methane. The marines rest. Chief knows the group is getting close to whatever they are heading to. He can feel that.  Finally, the marine's bickering becomes to much to bear, and John yells at them. He blatantly tells them there isn't anything to eat but the charred bodies on the ground.  Of course, this statement is met with disgust by the marines and joy by the Grunts. Chief frowns at that irony. Most marines refuse to eat. John himself is not yet hungry enough to eat another human.  The Grunts dig in, causing the humans to hate them even more.  Switch to soldier who was underground. He now has struggled through the dirt and lies exhausted, staring at the roof of a cave.  After a few of his thoughts, he sits up. The voice he had heard before is all but forgotten, but the haunting feeling that he had to do something remains. He knows he has to survive.  Getting up, he finds some parts of his body covered in mud-caked armor, very thick. Moving to the edge of the cave, he is shocked by what he sees. There is lightning and thunder plowing through the skies over a vast wasteland. Crevices spouting lava have opened up. Huge waves splash onto a high rock wall far beneath him. Giant cyclones shape the landscape, flowing over anything with ease. Great gusts nearly knock him off his feet, and he finds that his hair is very long.  The sky is as it would be at dusk. He hears something deep within his mind:  "This is your world. This is your Twilight."  Knowing that he is the only hope left, he marches out of the cave with no memory of his past. He knew there was a battle, but that is all.  Switch back to the Chief. The camp is angry, upset, and frustrated. None of them seem to be getting along, and Manson's constant nagging doesn't help things.  John thinks about things, recalling the moments before he lost Cortana. He remembers some of his past, the Spartan training. He tries to remember his friends.  It's then that Manson begins to start a fight with Jeremiah. Manson isn't exactly a small guy. He's not particularly muscular, but he's not tiny, either. Rogers, on the other hand, is very scrawny.  Chief is snapped out of his trance by their argument. Well, it's mostly Manson's argument. Jeremiah isn't very aggresive. There's a group of marines that have formed around the conflict, and just as John is about to break it up, his shield starts to crackle.  Turning around, he sees a dark wave approaching very fast on the horizon. This obviously makes him kind of jumpy, and he yells for everyone to get down. After a moment of bewilderment, everyone panics. They see the wave and fall into any hole or ditch they can find. Manson still does to asshole bit and keeps pushing Rogers away. Finally, Jeremiah snaps. He dives at Manson and they both start wrestling.  Chief considers stopping them, but knows there isn't enough time. The amount of radiation in the coming wave was more powerful than anything he had ever seen.  It goes over them, silent. All noise is lost. Jeremiah was standing up, the top half of his body engulfed in it. Manson was on the ground, but very close to it.  John feels the heat, even through his suit. The pressure is almost lethal. He screams along with all the others, out of sheer agony.  To them, it seems to last forever. A bending ray of dark and light, flowing endlessly above them. None of them can watch, but they feel it. They can imagine what it must look like.  The entire plain is engulfed, and then it fades, rushing off into the distance.  Sand and dirt is all that's left.  Chapter Five: SPF 5,000,000,000  The sound of an agonizing scream is what wakes John up. The ringing in his ears only grows as he tries moving. His entire body is stiff.  Cracks in his MJOLNIR armor let in sand, which doesn't make him very comfortable. A light blanket of soil has covered up the entire camp. Groggily, he struggles to get up. Brushing dirst off his visor, he sees the entire "Bad Lands" has turned a lighter shade. It's no longer a horrible, dark bog. Now it's almost white, a creamy, sandy color. The bodies have mostly been covered.  The sky above is a little brighter. Behind, it is full of fire. Ahead, only darkness.  Turning his attention to the constant screaming, he sees Manson has survived. This day just keeps getting better.  The marine's skin is red; he has been burned horribly. It's the worst case of sunburn John's ever seen. No wonder he's screaming. Nothing he says comes out coherently.  Chief looks around for the others. He finds some had already woken up, and were wandering about, waiting for death. Most are gone.  One surviving marine finds Jeremiah's body. It's a sickening sight. The top half was completely separated from the bottom. It almost looked microwaved. His skin had been dried, pulling up tight. His eyes were bulging, and his teeth froze in some sort of unholy grin.  Gathering the survivors, two of which are Grunts, he is about to head off once more. When a couple of marines go to pick up Manson, they realize his skin is still extremely affected. Their hands blister the moment they touch him.  Seeing that the radioactivity has not faded, John warns them to use something so they don't have to touch him. Fashioning restraints out of whatever remains they can find, they tie him up and take him along, despite his thrashing.  Switch to dark area. Two menacing voices threaten each other. They resound with wisdom and fierce authority.  One ends the conflict by saying it's time to go.  Back to Chief. He thinks about the current situation. Many lives have been lost. He wonders what he's still going on for. Those who sent that transmission probably didn't survive that second wave.  His entire life has been for humanity. He's used to taking orders. Now he's alone. He's the one in charge. It's tough.  The Grunts talk about the Survival being narrowed down. Only the most worthy will survive. Their trust in John is growing.  The soldiers march into the dark part of the sky. John sees a familiar looking structure, similar to the ones on Halo. This is where the light he saw before had come from. Knowing some answers must lie there, he goes forth.  Chapter Six: Best Friends Forever  The soldiers find the station admist a field completely unaffected by the waves. They know something about that is strange.  John cautions the others. They don't know what lies within the structure.  Exploring the outside yields nothing useful, so Chief leads the way in. Two marines stay with Manson outside.  Definitely a Forerunner building. John has the nagging feeling he's being watched, but sees nothing that might be dangerous. This is probably the safest place anyone could be.  Hoping that no Covenant are here, he explores. The group splits up, taking extra care to not lose each other. John heads into the heart of the structure after a brief look around.  He's surprised to find a lot of machines intact. Many things are still running fairly undamaged from wear over the years.  Suddenly he hears a yell, followed by a squeal from a Grunt. He rushes to find out what's going on.  He heads lower into the facility, only to find a giant hologram spanning a massive room. In the center is a blue data block, some kind of uber-mega computer. Standing next to it are a marine and a Grunt. Their faces are nonplussed. Chief is horrified.  The characters' blank stares only amplify the fear John had after noticing the ground at their feet was strewn with skeletons, all of different species.  He realizes at that moment that they must get out of that place as fast as possible. Yet, something tempts him to touch that data block. Something is calling him to it.  Entranced, his mind begins to be absorbed by the stream of information within that place. The Grunt and the human smile, not remembering any language. All that is left in them is the knowledge that the machine chose for them to know- that all thoughts must meld into that place.  Chief is suddenly brought back to his senses by an explosion that rocks the entire installation. He gasps, realizing what was happening. Some of the knowledge that machine possessed had been transferred into him when he pulled away. It lets out its equivalent of a scream of rage as he stares in terror before darting away.  The Grunt and the marine stare at each other, unmoving. The dumb smiles on their faces remain.  Chief rushes outside, using the screams of the others as guidance. When he makes it outside he is again knocked back by another predicament.  Manson's body has begun to swell up. His skin is stretching at an extremely rapid rate.  The marines watching over him have no idea what is going on. Chief can't get them to give him any straight answers. It seems something attacked them, but they don't know what it might have been.  The Grunt that remains says the big scary thing is back.  Apparently Manson was hit by something when that thing attacked them. Whatever it was, it had left, but now Manson was growing bigger and bigger, screaming all the while.  It took John only a moment to sort out his thoughts. Manson was a living, breathing nuclear bomb.  The Chief yells at the others to run as far away as possible. Manson cries out. No one would deserve what he goes through.  As everyone runs away, one marine falls and injures his ankle- no doubt the stress has finally gotten to him. Chief turns and starts running back. Manson keeps on growing.  Just as John dives to the fallen marine, Manson explodes. Light engulfs the Chief.  Change to a place full of light. Chief is dreaming. He remembers something. He doesn't know what it is, but it gives him a feeling that hope is left.  His mind wanders.  Back to his physical body. Chief slowly wakes up, sore from the explosion. His armor is scorched, his shield definitely disabled. He feels like he is burned, but nothing too serious.  In his hand, Chief holds a disembodied hand. The man he had tried to save was gone, disintegrated into that explosion.  If not for his shield, he would have suffered the same fate.  As he gets up from the sandy grave he had been dug, he sees the crater the explosion had left. For some reason, the lives of the other survivors just didn't seem to matter to him anymore. Something much more important was calling for him. He could feel it.  Suddenly, a powerful limb reaches out and knocks him down. John rolls onto his side, winded. His shield doesn't activate, and his armor is already cracked.  For a moment, his eyes are a blur. What had just attacked him? His ribs burn as he struggles to get back up.  Another blow, from behind. He feels his ribs crack as he is flung forward. Whatever is trying to kill him is very powerful.  Surprised, and very pissed off, John jumps to avoid another attack and grabs onto the "tentacle" that had come at him. It was made of metal.  He turns himself around and comes to face his attacker. It's a huge behemoth of steel, vaguely reminiscent of his own armor. Only a lot bigger.  Chief pushes himself away and the two fight.  After a brief struggle, the enemy finally gains the upper hand. Chief is forced against a wall, being choked.  At the very end, just before passing out, he sees the face of the pilot for a moment as the glare on its visor is toned down by a shadow.  It is his best friend, Sam.  ----  Agh, section two will be up soon. If anything confuses anyone, just get in touch with me and I'll explain it.
