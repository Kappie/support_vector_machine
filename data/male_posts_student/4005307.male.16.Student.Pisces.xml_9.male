We sprung for a Holiday Inn Express last night so that meant a great shower, no wacky B owners trying to feed us boiled fish for breakfast (kippers), and nice soft beds!  We then saw the 2000+ year old Roman Baths in Bath, England.  Jolly good time!  We picked up some Aqua glass for Cindy (it's a secret, so don't tell her) and then we hit Firth Castle.  It was cool.  From there, we went to Stonehenge and looked at big rocks and then on to Woodhenge where we saw a few people making out.  We just came from the Aveary Mansion and its multiple stone circles and they were big rocks too.  Jake is enjoying all of the culture except the paintball fields are few and far between.  It seems to be more a bachelor party thing than a team sport.  We are now on the road to Oxford where Jake is planning on interviewing for one of the PhD programmes.  (notice the two m's, per the English influence on us by this time)  I expect that we will go to an Ibis hotel on the way.  But for the time being, we just enjoyed some McDonalds - silly, I know but sometimes you need comfort food.  We are well.  We have loads of photos and I have not let Jake spend all of my money yet.......  Cheers! D
