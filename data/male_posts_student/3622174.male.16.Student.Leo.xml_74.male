This one is definitely one of the better animated movies ever.  New cast members like Antonio Banderas (as the hilarious Puss in Boots) and John Cleese (the king) make this movie even better than the original.     The Chronicles of Riddick:  Wow, this one was good.  Even though Vin Diesel is one of the worst actors in the world, he actually did pretty good with his role in The Chronicles of Riddick.  The game, too, is supposed to be very good, and it boasts Xbox Live play.  The movie, however, is the sequel to Pitch Black, and if you're into action gun-containing movies, this one is for you.   Spiderman 2:  I've been waiting since May 3, 2002 to see this one, and it's going to be awesome.  The surprises that are in store for me in Spiderman 2 are going to come very shockingly, as I refuse to look up anything about the movie, aside from who's in it and when its coming out.  I'm expecting this one to be my favorite movie of all time...at least until Spiderman 3 comes out.   The Day After Tomorrow:  I looked at so many previews for this one before going and seeing it, and I must admit, it was better than I thought it would be.  The director must really like destruction and chaos, because he's also the fool who did Independence Day back in 199-something.    And enough about movies, here's some other stuff that I've checked lately:  -Satellite Radio: So, my parents decided to get one of these for the car, and it's awesome.  Yeah, you can lose reception in a place like Tampa, but, overall, satellite radio is awesome, and for only $10 a month, it beats out regular radio.  No commercials, better stations (so you can listen to what you want to), and much better quality.  Well, that's about it.  I'll post something new tomorrow, unfortunately, my brother is coming home, and that's going to suck.  Majorly.  Until next time, adios!
