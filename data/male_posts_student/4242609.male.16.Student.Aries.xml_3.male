I'll probably post any exciting things that happen in my life that are worth mentioning, but I wouldn't expect many posts about that. I don't know how often I'll update. Sometimes I might update more than once a day, sometimes I might go a couple of weeks. It all depends what I feel like doing.  Enjoy.
