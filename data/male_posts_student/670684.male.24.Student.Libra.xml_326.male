I saw DD three or four years ago, and left the concert feeling terrible about myself because I had booed the band for not playing my favorite song...about 500 of us stuck around and booed, for no reason other than it was such a great concert that needed to end with THE REFLEX, but for some reason Simon LeBon didn't want to play it, as evidenced by saying after the end of the second curtain call, "This is it.  Good night."    So I'm watching BANDS REUNITED, and looking online for every damn 80s new wave band that might play a show, big or small.  Here's the list, and what they're doing  DAVID BOWIE - tour on east coast come March DAVID BYRNE - All Europe ELVIS COSTELLO - As close as Nashville PETER GABRIEL - nothing (was in Chicago this summer) THE CURE - Indio in May PSYCHADELLIC FURS - Same LAURIE ANDERSON - Austin in October (fuck her for that) ECHO  THE BUNNYMEN - nada MOODY BLUES - lots of Europe BRIAN FERRY - Australlia SIOUXSIE AND THE BANSHEES - dick A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS - up in the air SUNNY DAY REAL ESTATE - band split. again.  I used to play the game WHICH 80S SEXPOT WOULD YOU SLEEP WITH TODAY?  The contestants were Pat Benetar, Debbie Harry, and Chrisssie Hines.  Most chose Benetar.  I think I'd have to add Terri Nunn of Berlin now.  And she'd be my winner.  Best live performance I ever saw was her redeux Berlin during the Culture Club CLUB SANDWICH tour.    I know I'm looking to find flyshit in pepper, because the glory of these old bands is that they don't play the cash cow like REO Speedwagon, who tours the geriatric circuit every summer.  Some of the folks put out new music, some are on solo careers, and some are broken up.  But reunification is what I'm looking for!    Went looking for drums again...because I've only got a few months here, I don't want to spend a lot.  I'm quite tempted to get the turntables and look at a life of mixing...so few things bring me more happiness than great synth 80s music.  Some of my fondest memories are driving US 80 from Mesquite to Terrell, reliving a weekend of paradise with Katie Carnahan, and listening to KDGE's RED SQUARE RETRO 80s dance party on my dilapadated car radio.  No commercials, little talking...just 80s glory.  The song that always stops life and brings me back to the days of life when I owned the world and nothing ever went wrong - The Smiths' HOW SOON IS NOW?  I always marked my progress by a confectionary on the north side of the road.  When I passed that, I knew I had six miles of unadulterated land and sky to visually enjoy as the car drove itself to Shreveport.
