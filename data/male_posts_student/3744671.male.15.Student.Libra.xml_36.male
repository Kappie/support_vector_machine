It's almost impossible to remember all your different passwords so that's why there's a program called KeePass.  This is definitely the best Password Safe I've come across. To find out more info on this fantastic program, or download it for  FREE  go  urlLink here  :)  For more info on this app, head to  urlLink kevinrose.com       ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
