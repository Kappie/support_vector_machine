It's the uncertainty of hope that I hate.  I realized this when I was watching Donnie Darko with k-ray yesterday. I find her so damn sexxy but even if I got into a romance with her she oviously does not feel the same about me. So I just don't care any more.  I am going to Amanda's Little Rock celebration tonite. This will be depressing. I need to get out though.  Fingernail painting did not go so well. If any of my female readers what to get together, paint my nails, and see where that leads give me a ring. or a comment or something.
