Haha...When I think about it, I go out of my way for people who don't really give a shit about me. Is that cool? I think not. Thought you'd agree. Anyway, I just think about stuff that I go through  not tell anyone, cuz I don't want to burden people. Sure, I talk about problems  stuff with friends, but who wants to be depressed all the time? I guess praying is the only way to go these days. Sometimes I like helping people with their problems, but when that's ALL they ever wanna talk about, I feel stupid. Is that the only reason they're talking to me? Hell yes it is. It's hella annoying. Then you've got your people who never give a shit...and that's even worse. Kind of...they're just complete opposites. So, in realizing that I care too much about other people, I'm thinking...I need time for me. I need to say what I want to say. I'm gonna say what I want to say. I'm gonna do whatever I want, cuz it's about damn time I did. I've got the bestest friends in the world..they know who they are, and they come first. Other than them, I don't care about anyone else :D. How boring am I? Don't answer that...but hey, I never said I was exciting. I mean, I am. Just not right now. And now that I've said it, you can argue. Whatever. :) So...this Friday night is gonna rock, cuz it's me and my peeps again...Carly, Josh  Megan. We had an awesome time last weekend...goin to Movie Gallery for 3 hours..haha..:P..and Carly MAKING me and Josh go wait in the car. :( Oh, did I mention walking down Carly's road is a lot of fun? Except Megan  I got skeered...creepy stuff! It was foggy out..Oh, and there's no telling what's gonna happen this weekend. :| hehehehehe...*evil grin* Peace  All that shit... SiLaS
