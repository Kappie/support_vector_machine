We went on this one water ride and both me and Tim P. got soaked....I had water EVERYWHERE lol. I felt like my nuts were floating beneath me lol. Before we left we went on The Hulk like three more times but then I got dizzy and Tim had a headache so we were like thats enough lol. Oh and OMG Jessica's boob popped out in the picture LMFAO. Tim was like "Damn I missed it!" Today was awesome!
