I'm listening to Matthew West's  More  on the radio.  I just LOVE this song.  The chorus goes:  I love you more than the sun and the stars  that I taught how to shine  you are mine and you shine for me too I love you  yesterday and today and tomorrow I'll sing it again and again I love you more  For some reason, that song just seems so wonderful to me.  God's love is so great, even though we have done nothing to deserve it.  He made so many immense and powerful objects in His creation, such as the sun and the stars, yet, out of all of Creation, we are the only things to which He gave souls.  He wants to spend eternity with us, and I, not being able to completely grasp the concept of His love, can't possibly figure out why.    Now FFH's  One of These Days  is on the radio.  I haven't listened to this song in a while, but man, I love the lyrics.  It talks about when we get to heaven, and all the things we will do there.  Here's the chorus:  One of these days I'm gonna see the hand that took the nails for me One of these days I'm gonna hold the key to the mansion built for me One of these days I'm gonna walk the streets of gold that were paved for me One of these days I'm gonna see my Savior face to face One of these days  I really like this song.  Its content reminds me somewhat of the newer song  I Can Only Imagine .  Heaven's gonna be awesome, I can't wait until I get there.  Until then, I guess I will just focus on getting to know God and trying to make the world a better place.  I don't mind having to make the best of the little time I have on earth, considering that I have an eternity to spend in heaven.   God is good...
