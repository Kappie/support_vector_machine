Last week, we took some friends out to a new restaurant, and noticed that the waiter who took our order carried a spoon in his shirt pocket. It seemed a little strange.  When another waiter brought our water and utensils, I noticed he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket. Then I looked around saw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets.   When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, "Why the spoon?"  "Well," he explained, "the restaurant's owners hired Andersen Consulting to revamp all our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our personnel are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift."  As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare.  "I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now." I was impressed.  And I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's fly. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, "Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?"  "Oh, certainly!" Then he lowered his voice. "Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we could save time in toilet. By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the toilet by 76.39 percent."  "After you get it out, how do you put it back?"                                "Well," he whispered, "I don't know about the others, but I use the spoon."  -- posted on rtsgames.com forums by cwntnts on Jul 7 2004, 07:53 AM    2.here's another one involving protruding body parts: 3 men and a cannibal   three people were shipwrecked and were stranded on an island. Whilst exploring, they run into a native of the island and ask for directions to leave.  The native says:  "I will show you a way off this island if the lengths of all 3 of your penises combined is at least as long as mine. If they are not, then I will eat the 3 of you."  With nothing to lose, they readily agreed. The native reveals his penis, and to the 3 men's suprise, it's 20 inches long!  The first man then proceeds to take off his pants, and whips out a 10-inch penis.  The second man takes of his pants, and he's got a 9-inch penis.  "We're outta here," thought the first 2 men, "there's no way we're not going to be able to match the native's penis length."  The third man takes off his pants...                                 ...and he's got a 1-inch penis.  Stunned, but nevertheless elated that they are able to leave the island, they pull up their pants, and follow the native to a beach where a boat was run up onto the sand.   As they're sitting on the boat, heading home, the first guy says:  "You know, you guys are lucky I've got a 10-inch penis."  The second guy says:  "Yeah, but you guys are also lucky that I've got a 9-inch penis."  The third guy says:  "You guys are lucky I got an erection."  --originally posted in rtsgames.com forums by Snoops on Jul 8 2004, 02:32 AM    more interesting jokes, this time shorter. if you do not understand the first and last, don't attempt to; we need more people like you...   A drunk driver got pulled over by a police woman. She said "anything you say can and will be held against you." The drunk replied "tits."   What did one fat girl say to the other fat girl? Who cares, they're fat.  A girl's legs are her best friends, but even the best of friends must part.   and, i've got a puzzle as well:   This is sort of a logic problem and I'm not sure if someone has posted this before, but it's one of my favorites.  Three of the wisest and most clever men in the kingdom were in a dispute about who was the wisest man in the kingdom. To settle this dispute, they traveled to the king's palace to ask for his decision on the matter. The king thought and then arranged for a mind challenge among the three men to settle the dispute.  The king takes the three men to a chamber and blindfolds them all. He then places a hat on each of their heads.  "Now, I've placed a hat on each of your heads. You may either have a blue hat or a white hat on your head. When I instruct you to remove your blindfolds, your challenge will be to figure out what color hat you are wearing, but you may only look at the other two and you may not remove your hat. The first man to shout out the correct color will be declared the wisest man. If you guess wrong, then you will lose your head, but you can keep the hat. The only hint I will give you is that there are not three white hats here."  When the men took off their blindfolds, they stared and pondered, not wanting to shout out an incorrect answer. After a long time of this stalemate, one of the wise men confidently declared the color of his hat. How did he figure it out?  Now I could tell you exactly what he saw, so that you and the wise man would be on equal footing. But can you figure it out without having to look at all?  This is pure logic, no wordplay or tricks.   -- rtsgames.com forums, Gatekreeper          solution: all three of them are wearing blue hats. If there were two white hats and one blue hat, the person with the blue hat would immediately shout out that he had a blue hat. There was a long pause after the blindfolds were removed, so this is an impossibility.   If a wise man sees one white hat and one blue hat, then he knows that he cannot have a white hat, because then the man with the blue hat would immediately say that he has a blue hat. So then he would know that he would have to have a blue hat, and this wise man would say it. Since nobody said anything for a long time, this situation also would not happen.  Therefore, all the wise men see two blue hats, because all of the hats are blue.   that's all i have, farewell for now.
