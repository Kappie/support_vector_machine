Identical twins become seperate and different entities at birth, or rather the first moment of consciousness for each unit, when the personal experiences of each changes them due to the infinite and minute possible differences. 3. Considering point 2, we can determine that genetic identicals are different consciousnesses based on differing experiences. 4. Following the path of time, using basic units as a measure, and genetic makeup/current experience as variables, with the evaluation of one entity, it is discovered that at each point in time exists a different individual, considering that an individual is made up of his body and personality influenced by experience. 5. Hence, each conscious being is a collection of seperate entities replacing one another along a temporal path.  Just makes you think.
