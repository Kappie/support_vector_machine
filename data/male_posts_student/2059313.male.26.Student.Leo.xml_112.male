My gas gauge read about an eighth of a tank... the idiot light had not turned on.  I was driving down the bypass when my car wouldn't quite pick-up-and-go.  It started to kind of sputter, and suddenly a couple of lights lit up on my dash console, and it became difficult to apply pressure to the brakes and to turn the steering wheel.  The realization hit me, I was out of gas.  I had the forethought to scan the road really quick and see how far away any gas stations were.  I had just passed three and was coming upon a fourth.  Fortunately, I had enough momentum to be able to coast into a Shell station on the right.  God was really watching out for me, because there was no traffic between me and the station.  I coasted up next to the pump perfectly, tugging at the steering wheel for it to obey my command, and mashing down on the brake pedal as hard as I could to make my car completely stop.  I don't think anyone was the wiser, so the experience wasn't as bad or embarassing as my other two times had been.  THe only bad part is I knew how my gas gauge works, and I ignored it... I tried to push my car to the limits, and it finally gave and I did NOt triumph... except that I made it to the station before it completely stopped moving.  Would't that be funny if I had to call my friend who I've been comforting and being with, to come and help me now... how worthless would that have made me feel... heh.  Life cracks me up.
