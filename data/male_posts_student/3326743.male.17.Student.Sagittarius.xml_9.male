I looked at 1 Timothy and I think it meets what we wanted.  Right away Paul talks about who he is: chief of sinners.  After we finish this one we can go on to one of the others if we feel that is where we should go.  I hope you guys are checking this blog.  I'm going to try to email less and instead just post on here.  Well see ya.
