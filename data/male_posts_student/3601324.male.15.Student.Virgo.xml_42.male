Now this is quite a do-gooder kind of penguin. ^^ Being one of these wondrous birds is quite the experience; I'm what can be known as 'the quiet one' or in some extreme cases 'the wussy one'. This is because I have a great affinity for helping people out. My broad repertoire of healing techniques are well-known. Those who stick by me are lucky, as I tend to help them when help is most needed.   I don't think much of myself, and never put my own well-being above my friends. I'm calm, pleasant, intelligent, and vastly fun to talk to. On the battlefield, however, my healing purposes are my only strength. When it comes down to actually fighting, I'm not exactly gifted. Hiding behind a strong friend is always the best option! XD    This is old, but way awesome. :D
