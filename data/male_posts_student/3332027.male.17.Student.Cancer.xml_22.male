This is off his second album "RoOm FoR SquAreS"                                "Not Myself"                                Suppose I said                            I am on my best behavior                               And there are times                            I lose my worried mind                        Would you want me when I'm not myself?                      Wait it out while I am someone else?                                   Suppose I said                      Colors change for no good reason                                And words will go                              From poetry to prose                       Would you want me when I'm not myself?                      Wait it out while I am someone else?                          And I, in time, will come around                               I always do for you                                   Supose I said                            You're my saving grace?
