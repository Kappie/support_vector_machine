I sat on the curb and kept an eye on my little cousins. It was funny because the people handing out candy sort of gave me weird looks like I was too old for candy, then didn't give me any. I got laughs, but no candy. Some racing float or something came along. They were handing out a few flags. Others got American flags, but I opted for the checkered flag. I waved it animatedly as the BACP "marched" by, but Mattson was staring directly ahead, John was strutting, the rest of 'em were being swept on by the giant crowd. I was sadly unseen.   Though I disagreed with the message BACP was marching for, I still applauded them. I also applauded when a bunch of horses crapped right in front of where I was sitting. The only time I didn't applaud was when I was scrounging me some candy or waving my checkered flag.  On a quick side note, Tickle told me my IQ is 147 and my theme song is "Back in Black." I must admit, I do like that guitar.  Back to blogging. Did you know "blog" isn't included in the the blogger spellcheck? Anyway, of course there are folks being this way. I'm frankly shocked that Mattson goes on and on about all this. We live in the midwest, a humongous resort, tourism, and retirement area. As old folks move in and ore miners move out, the state's votes swing Republican. The old conservatives are set in their ways.    My tactic was to look at the biggest hecklers and smile as widely as I could at them.   I'm shocked. Something Mattson morally does that I feel I should applaud. Sometimes it's the ones you least expect.  In other nagging news... Galaxies and Beyond WoT RPG Song Mix  Too many chiefs, not enough indians! Too much planning, not enough working. This is what you're doing; this is what I want you to do.  To the Hobster Jetpack Amadeus Yoshihanna Slowbie: Only game so far is Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. Which is okay since we don't have the console yet. When it arrives, we'll get Halo and Topspin for sure.  I think I like the Casualties. And a lot of the dirty reggae Mattson listens to too. Not necessarily the lyrics, but if its got a good beat, or even better some awesome harmony/dissidence, mainly notes/chords themselves. I love the harmony in "Never had to Knock on Wood." Listening to "Mrs. Robinson," check out the chord change in the two measures before they start singing. I pull hair out of my scalp every time I hear that, it's so awesome.   Had a tennis tourney in Elk River today. Got up half and hour before needed to get there half and hour before needed, don't ask me why. Hobe and PK won first round, then got schooled by Ronning and John's Willmar friend - Jesse Forsell. I don't think he's with Willmar anymore... we saw him at Alex, right Johnny V? You can back me up on this one.  Me and Jefe lost right away, then won, won, then waited about 3 hours for the other bracket to catch up for consolation. After leading 5-2, they stepped it up, Jefe and I started totally biffing them at the net, and Geoffrey's service game went to pot. We lost 10-7, so it kinda sucked, but we got good experience from it, and had some fun doing it. Excpet hobe and pk, who mostly sat around since they were already out.  I'll see y'all some other time.
