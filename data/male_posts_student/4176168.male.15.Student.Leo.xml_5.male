I finally got a cover for my handbook today!....thank godness...now all I need to do is mess with photoshop, put a title, and send it off...the deadline is today, but I feel too tired to do it now, another 12 hours wouldn't hurt. :P  I got to spend some quality time with my family today, had dinner, did some games, watch the Olympic game...a guy like me can get use to a life like this...everyting is good. :)  Later days  "Television's influence is much too subtle to be detected by its victims." - Milton Shulman  Neo...
