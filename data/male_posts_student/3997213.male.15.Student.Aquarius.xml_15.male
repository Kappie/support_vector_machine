I even found it in me to clean the house and do the dishes today. See, mom had to take Reid to drums at 10:15 and I ended up watching Riley until 1:30. Mom went over to the hospital to see my nana after Reid's lesson. I cleaned the rooms, made the beds, did the dishes, made Riley lunch, and I tell you I was thinking, only THINKING, about vaccuming and sweeping the floor. (Don't worrry. I don't think I would go that far) But, overall, it paid off. Mom came home to a clean house and a not-so-clean-wet-diaper Riley. (I knew I was forgetting something!) When I got my break, I went up to my computer and played a computer game. Oh yeah. Did I mention that while I was being perfect son and cleaning Reid sat on his butt and played on the downstairs computer. I don't think he even moved until the 15 minutes before mom arrived and that was because he knew he had to clean up the clothes in his room. I had gymnastics at 5:00. My hands were bleeding after I ripped em open on the bar. So I got to relax the last 5 minutes of practice. It felt good. We went straight over to Virtua hospital after that to visit my nana. Here I am with dried up blood and chalk on my hand (Predominately the right hand) walking through a hospital. Not that I really cared, but it was uncomfortable. Anyway, we gave her a visit. Big Brother came on at 8:00 and I missed the first 45 minutes of it. That's okay though. I got all the details at the website. So that about wraps up my day. Who knows what I'll end up doing tomorrow but I can tell you that watching Riley for a while is definately up there on the possibilities list.
