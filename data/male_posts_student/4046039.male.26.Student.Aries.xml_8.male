God told Moses His name =  I AM , as a result...every one of us, every single person's name is = I am not. Why? simply because we are not God.  'I am not' (my name and your name) but I know ' I AM ' (God's Name).  One of my goals in life is to preach and remind people wherever I go that God is  HUGE .  I AM.  Secondly, to say with confidence that wherever I serve I can say, "I AM, has sent me to you."
