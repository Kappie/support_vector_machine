So i went to school and it was fun becuase i did my math homework for the first time in my life!!! Than off to second i went and i rebuilt my lawnmower engine in 10 minutes!! im proud! after i completed the beast (the engine) i went on the computers and owned Drag Racer V3!! Anywho i went to break and i sat down because thats what i usually do. Off to 3rd i go. So anyways we were reviewing a bunch of stuff and i didnt listen as usual and thats my 3rd period story. Lunch time came and i ate my lunch and than went to Ms Shisslers room for help with math and that took my whole lunch hour which sucked because i like conversing with students at the lunch table. Now we went to 4th and I sat down in my chair and made people touch my fluffy hair because it was so soft!. We found out we had a pep rally the whole class so that was cool. After the funny slightly boring pep rally was over we had gym and we had an edo which was even cooler! Me and Spencer sat on a chair and sat there because we had nothing to do and Spencer nutted Mark Ennis. That was so not cool! OOOOOO i almost forgot on the way to 5th i saw Erin and she said hi so i said hi back. So anywho i went home after school and sat down in the living room and chatted with my mother before i went to my room and went on msn. After a little bit of time on msn i went and had supper which was hamburger helper... it was allright since im not a big fan of it. After that i went back downstairs and went on my computer for a bit more and than lied down on my bed and almost fell asleep untill spencer called. So i went upstairs to wait for spencer because he was coming over and while i was up there my dad started talking with me so i enjoyed and than went outside and waited for spencer and scooted on my scooter. After he showed up we went downstairs and started playing halo. I went on msn after he annihalated me and Erin asked me to write a long blog for her to read so i am and now im going to finish this because theres nothing more to write goodnight for now   *-*Matty*-*
