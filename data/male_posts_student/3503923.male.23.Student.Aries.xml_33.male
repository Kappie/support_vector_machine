It gets you clock watching, checking whether the inevitable deadline would approach any quicker if you somehow monitored the situation, keeping a close eye on the movements of time. The 'here and now' is displaced into a future 'there' that has to happen now. However you act, whatever you do in the 'now', it cannot remove the present 'now' in by-passing swiftly to an anticipated 'there'. For some to wait is a deadly bore, others may count it as a daily pain, few run off, snoring still. Heard of stories, of mountain gorillas, irksomely ill-behaved creatures who leap years, remove themselves from the body, and chase fire-breathing dragons.   Having been unable to discover a port through which we can usher in the moment of life completing fulfillment that we believe to exist in the 'there', we have thrust ourselves into a time-warp ignoring eternity. We are efficient at consuming time efficiently, inefficiently, and before doing this, we plan to do it. Thus, we devise plans for our time, time-management if you like; the alien nature of the new managerial position you hold, leading to half-baked ideas about what would be time well spent as a future investment, or what is utter uselessness, nothing but a lost cause. It is a precious commodity, our time; we have only a fixed number of days to roam the planet earth, before the gates of eternity fling open, admitting us in one by one.  So we find ourselves in this slightly uncomfortable position of: time-management-co-ordinator in charge of allotted gifts of life. We can procrastinate and delay; chase and speed-up, all the while, wishing to move things forward, or clambering back in reverse, digging our heels into the turf of today. Young people always want things now, for things to move forward, are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet... On the whole, the older generation, longingly reminisce about the former glories, looking back on the 'good old days', talking of a past that is irretrievably lost; gone, never to be regained, locked away in the dungeons of history makers.  When did time seize to be an issue with a 6-year-old boy. When the present presented him with the opportunity to forget that which was coming. A good distraction, that locked his thoughts on the enjoyment of the present. A bag of Minstrels, now that sometimes does the trick, although anything less than four at a time in a smallish mouth, does not impair his speech enough to stop him asking for the time. A jaw- dropping, mouth-filling, baby-suffocating, ball-bearing, drool-inducing, teeth-breaking, gum-splitting GobStopper is what you want for complete success. It's sweet enough, last for minutes even hours, fills the entire mouth, and reduces any audible time request into a hotch-potch goboldi-gook. You're onto a winner.  The youth expect to move quickly to times when they have more freedom; the old want to prolong their stay, in whichever faddish way. They control and manipulate time for their own desire. When does time no longer matter; when you realise in the 'here and now' that eternity shall be and death will come.  "Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the LORD  for ever ."
