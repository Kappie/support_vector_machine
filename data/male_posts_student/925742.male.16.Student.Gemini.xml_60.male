I am frequently described as serious, intense, distant, cruel, and arrogant.  If I ever had a chance, I would become Doctor Fucking Doom. Thats how much I frequently hate the world.  Sure, I know whats in stead for me, but sometimes I can't handle it.  Rumors.  Girls that don't accept.  Fucks that make threats.  My heart isn't black, its just that people don't understand and accept.      And anyway, I'd rather have  a sword than a metal bar (but I have both in my possesion)
