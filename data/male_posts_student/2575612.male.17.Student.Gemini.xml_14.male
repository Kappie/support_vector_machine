"Quicker still slowpoke" said he at the age of 25, "i have much accomplish, are you tired now?"   Life is strange. Mysterious. Ever changing, ever shifting. School. Marriage. Children. thoughts of forgotten adventure hang hidden in the back of the mind.   "There is much more time to be, let us play!" he said to his youngest, 7, he at the age of 39.   Life is strange. Mysterious. Ever changing, ever shifting.   "Come now young uns', let me rest. Then i shall read a book to you." he said with the same quick eyes, his same quick humorous tongue remarks to the 4 youngest grandchildren, the oldest had much to do as of late. brushing, dancing, singing, no time for sweet ol' grandpa who now was at the ripe old age of 74!   Life is strange. Mysterious. Ever changing, ever shifting.   "I would much like to see the mountains again my boy. Where has the time gone..." this is said, he did, with no more than three hours left in him.  "Don't fret, father there is much to do still! Quickly, hurry up!"     Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,  Old time is still a-flying,  And this same flower that smiles today,  To-morrow will be dying.  To the Virgins, Make much of Time ~ Robert Herrick
