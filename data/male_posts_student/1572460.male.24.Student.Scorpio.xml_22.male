Two articles that instantly impressed me: 1. Samit Bal's beautiful piece on  urlLink the celebration of orthodoxy .  2. Amit Varma's  urlLink Wisden archive  on two cricketing gods, written not so long ago.  We have seen  urlLink Dada Ganguly  successfully dancing to the tune of chin music. We have seen Rahul Dravid erecting the Great Wall of India. We have seen why VVS is poetry in motion. We have even seen the  urlLink Bombay Duck  learning to fly ( urlLink plagiarized from Cricinfo ) . . .!  But its not over yet. Its the calm before the storm. If you've read  urlLink this blog , you'll guess that I already have visions of another of those  slices of heaven . Its imminent, and it  will  descend onto mother earth.  Sure, we are waiting.
