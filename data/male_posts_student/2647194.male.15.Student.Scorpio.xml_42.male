Sometimes they get so cold they tingle-my room's got 2 outside walls, my house is 124 years old, uninsulated, and Victorian. What fun.  Anyway, the prospect for this weekend isn't looking two great. I've got tons of stuff that I have to do, with only 1 really good/fun thing, but it's enough to get me through my english project, math that I don't really understand as much as I would want to, spanish, science, and social. Yeah, it's got something to do with these three things: Saturday evening, Underground, and Amanda. lol  ReCaP:  Science: Again, I was pulled away from class by the call of music (band). But hey-I'm a band freak, nerd, or any other name for someone who's in possibly too many bands. That's what you get, and I like it. Today's lab used: bunsen burners, and E. Coli bacteria. We did gram-staining stuff. The funny moment from this: Matt held his slide in the flame for about 5 seconds. The glass half melted, half shattered into several pieces. That's exactly why you pass the slide through the flame...isn't it?  Spanish: Yes, the RaNdOm SpAnIsH fUnNy Of ThE dAy is back! Here it is: Sam, Matt, Pat, Anton, and I all planned this "fiesta" for today, which we claimed Mrs. Sustic had planned. She hadn't, but we brought a toaster, jelly, peanut butter, bread, cookies, and chips. Our little 5 minute break turned into 15 minutes.  Yet another: With another round of the "Vamos a comer?" routine, we convinced Mrs. Sustic that we were to go to lunch at the same time we always do on non block days, except it was an hour earlier. I think someone told Mrs. Sustic that it was block day though...grr...  Social: I will now expand upon the statement of last night's post. A few nights ago, my year-old computer's burner drive stopped burning, and the floppy drive was acting up last night too. This meant that I couldn't put my social project onto any type of transportation...except email. It took a goodly amount of time to attach the damned thing, which I had to break into 3 files and send 3 separate emails with 1 per email. I was up until about 10:40 last night, steaming at my computer, talking on AIM, and trying to figure out how to get my project ready. As it turned out, I was able to collate it during study hall today. Thank God for study hall, and thank God for me having social 6th period...I also happened to be the first presenter, simply because I had Michelangelo, the all-important Renaissance artist. And apparently I'm going to make everyone else with powerpoint presentations look bad because I had 13 slides, plenty of information, and I was able to add extra information by memory. I guess it just comes from my good composure in speaking to a group...  As for Thursday:  English: UGH! This stupid project now includes making tons of notecards. I greatly look forward to taking all these damned notes and documenting them over the weekend...  Band: Running through the songs for our concerts that are coming up pretty soon has become pretty routine, with the exception of Jazz day of course. I swear, I never get to solo on the piano during the warm-up blues thing at the start...NEVER! It really erks me...  Math: We're learning about Vectors (not Victors....lol Kellen) in chapter 10. Plus, there's some of it I really don't like. Such as problem 3, chapter 10, section 3. I spent the whole f@#$ing hour doing that one...it erks me (lol, people should use that word more).  Well, that pretty much sums up the school part of yesterday and today.  New addition to Fridays after choir: 1/2 hour drum lessons (yes, I teach AND take drum lessons now) with Ajay. Only 10 bucks for a half hour. I need more students! (because I'm 400 dollars in debt!!)  Hopefully I can make something of tonight other than doing homework...like I ever do homework on Fridays...ha!  To close, I'll supply you all with lyrics from a song I've grown to like over the past few days. And NO, its NOT a COLDPLAY song...lol. I like most of their stuff, and I know just about all of their stuff, so there's not much to discover.  "I’m not alone cause the TV’s on yeah. I’m not crazy cause I take the right pills everyday. And rest, clean your conscious, clear your thoughts with speyside with your grain. Clean your conscious, clear your thoughts with speyside. Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt. Our hearts littering the topsoil. Tune in and we can get the last call. Our lives, our coal. Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt. Our hearts littering the topsoil. Sign up it's the picket line or the parade. Our lives. I’m not alone cause the TV’s on yeah. I’m not crazy cause I take the right pills everyday. And rest, clean your conscious, clear your thoughts with speyside with your grain. Clean your conscious, clear your thoughts with speyside.  Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt.

Sign up it's the picket line or the parade, our lives. (I bled the) greed from my arm. Won’t they give it a rest now? Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt. Our hearts littering the topsoil.

Sign up it's the picket line or the parade."  --"Bleed American", Jimmy Eat World.
