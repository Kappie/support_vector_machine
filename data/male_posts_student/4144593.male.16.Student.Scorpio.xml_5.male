Next up CEP, nite-mare has cum....... Stoopid mr soh dun tell us the marks first. Say wat noe marks liao no 1 listen to him teach.He dun say the marks every1 even more anixious,no feelin to study. Anyway he said a lot ppl failed. Predicted tt i was 1 of the ppl who failed. Then he went through answers. I think i got nearly everything in the front wrong. During break i really tot i was gonna fail cuz i seemed to get everything wrong. Every1 tot i was being a hypocrate or being humble but i really tot i was gonna fail. After the break when he flashed the answers for the last few qus,i suddenly felt i may pass..... in the end i passed the test. Guessed the last 3 qus saved my sry ass. Did not get really good grades but i guessed i'm just happy to passed cuz a lot of ppl failed the test very badly.   Went for lunch with the guyz and teikjun. Teik jun left halfway while we were eating dunno why.......... he just left like tt.... we were very sure we did not offend him in any way...guessed tt he was feelin down due to the CEP test. Went to the lab next,did the tutorial.... luckily i still got do tutorial 3 and 4 cuz of the test. But i did not do tutorial5 so i was sleepin when he was teachin it. But i guessed i understood everything so it's alrite. Did not do the lab cuz mr roberts blur....... I stayed back after every1 left cuz some of the stuff i forgot save in the diskette so i had to write it in myself. Then dunno who said i stayed back cuz i'm suppose to teach steph today...and i was like HUH ???? AM i even suppose to teach today .... I been really forgetful recently so if i'm suppose to teach today, i'm sry tt i forgot and i had to go off cuz i have something on. Then again I dun even remember sayin i'm gonna to teach today... Some1 plz tell mi wats going on....
