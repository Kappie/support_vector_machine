I was late, mother dearest made me miss BART. transfer train was also late-resulting in my "fashionably late" arrival this morning. its all good, i think i just missed the stretch. I'm glad I got there when I did cause that ummm stretch shawn was haivng us do is very relaxing. Even though I can't really completely do it cause my spine is not straight and it hurts like a bitch to let my head hang-relaxing. Shawn decided to change things up a bit, but thats ok, according to the latest Karlin-Amistoso regime what we did today would be the first and second halves of the B block. Anyways, what am I supposed to be posting? I asked Chelsea but she did not answer. I've been working my arms out all week and it really paid off. haha i mean yeah my bari is still a total bitch but my arms were not shaking as much as usual today:). I've been getting lessons from Phil and its really helping. Today I could actually hit an F (G for you treble fools) For those of you who do not know I believe Victor and Nic (bari not mello) are the only woodwind players in the line now I do not play clarinet anymore. BD is a family show so i cannot say why in here, i think all the people in this blog know already anyway. I dont really have much to say right now, my brain was worked really hard today and I cant really think straight. so yeah next time will be better i promise.
