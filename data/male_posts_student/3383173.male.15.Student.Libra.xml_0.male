Getting little Ryuzuki here mad as hell, and I don't want to see what happens to those guys if ever Ryuzuki meets them... Bloody... It's going to be too bloody for my tastes... Poor guys... Hope you had a happy life messing up someone else's! Cause your puny pathetic excuse for a life is going down the drain I like to call Ryuzuki's anger... Sure, he can take his anger and shut it in a very big room, leaving him sane for about two years... Well, he's been keeping his anger in for over five years now, and he's telling me he's going to let it all out, but this time, not on some unfortunate piece of wood, but on a lucky guinea pig who likes to mess with his sister's "peaceful" life. So, good luck, whoever you are, you lucky bastard... You get to feel Ryuzuki's cold-blooded anger first hand... I envy you, really, I do... But I don't think I will after I see the results...  Sakura, don't stop Ryuzuki on this one, Sese, don't even think about helping Ryuzuki on this one, and as for Taka, Tyr, and Lady Oria, please do as he says, and keep out of it.  You'd best look at the fire (blood) works... And hope you have enough detergent to scrub off the blood that's going to fly your way...   -Kazeshi (As named by Ryuzuki)
