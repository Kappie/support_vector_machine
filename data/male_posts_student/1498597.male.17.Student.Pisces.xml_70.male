Well, actually, I've been here all the time, but...if you don't know me, well...see...people would prolly describe me as a..."procrastinator"...Heh, I'd say they're flatterin' me...Anyway some people forget their obligations...I'm one of those people!  OK...movin' along...(Sorry  Nick , I know that's your phrase!)  Well, the day I finally get off my lazy ass and blog,  Nick  has to be off on vacation!  Ironic, almost, since he was left with the responsibility of managin' the blog and keepin' it up to date.  Well, whatever, yer efforts aren't gonna go to shit  Nick , cuz I'm back on track!  Well, lets see, whats new...?  Like the  T.E.W.  and  P.R.E. , I'd been neglectin' nearly all of my responsibilities...fuck, to tell you the truth, at some point, I didn't know what the fuck I was doin'...maybe I should save the personal info for the P.R.E., no?  There aren't any real updates anyway, so....fuck it.  There is one thing though...I had noticed that  Nick  likes to put song lyrics up and the  T.E.W.  and his own blog,  Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare .  I thought I'd tell him maybe we should make that a weekly thing...postin' lyrics on the blog every now and then.  Well, I'll consult with him first, he is comin' back today...I think.  Also, I'm sure  Nick  told you all about this  BlogShares  thing and that you could ask him any questions about it...yeah, well thats the way its gonna stay, cuz I dunno a fuckin' thing about  BlogShares , and so I'll just let  Nick  handle it...man, I leave for just a few weeks and when I come back, we've become a fuckin' coperation!  Shit...damn those coperate bastards, damn them to hell!
