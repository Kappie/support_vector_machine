Congrats, nonetheless).  Never can tell, you may eventually start getting so many fan mails that you have to open a new account for it all. (Hmm.. maybe the bow would be a good idea, after all.. pretty bows...)  Now... There is absolutely no reason for you to believe you're a failure as a human being. We  all  make assumptions and mistakes, and often the two go hand in hand. It's really not your fault that you've assumed these things. You wouldn't have assumed anything, if someone hadn't said, or done, something to make you believe it. You know as well as I do that some people (myself included, a lot of the time) have a habit of ranting and raving when something goes wrong and not saying very much, at all, about the good, when it finally happens. Like so much in this life, the good is taken for granted, and yes, it's wrong and should be remedied (still working on it, on my part).  There's not as much of a drive to let everyone know when everything seems to be going decently as there is when there's something or someone about whom we want to complain. That's part of why it's called "venting," I think.  You, my friend, are one of the truest, most giving, caring individuals that I have ever had the priviledge of calling a friend. Even when you've had a bad day or are not feeling well, you still put your friends first and try to make sure that they're ok. (Just make sure you put yourself first every now and then, too. K?) You are in no way, shape, or form a failure as a human being. And anyone who says so is going to find themselves with a few bricks upside their respective heads.   So, having said that, I'm off to send imitation fan mail to myself (better than imitation bacon bits, y'know).    Slan
