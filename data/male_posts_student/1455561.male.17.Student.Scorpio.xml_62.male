"jamie cullem biography" - he was born. he played the piano. he jazz slapped the piano. he sung badly. it continues.   "clipart of cack" - again, i think there is a massive internet problem with spelling the word cake    There are also some very sick people out there who have found this by typing some horrific things into google. There's even one person..... from bristol.   yeah, i feel scared too.
