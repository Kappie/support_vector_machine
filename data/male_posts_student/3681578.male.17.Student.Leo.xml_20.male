Lets see what I have for tomorrow...  ECE 12-AutoCAD stuff with soon-to-be Engr. Arthur Gerona...um, not much about this...I do think he will just give that routinary discussion of stuff in the AutoCAD Manual without much exercise...  English 11-Writing stuff with Dr. Pesigan (dubbed as Gimo or Doc Pest)...um, he assigned this "research kit" thingy where we should be placing all papers and the like about the "full-blown" research paper we are doing...well, I'll just have to buy a bunch of stuff like index cards and folders on Monday sa Caf to shut him up...Oh, and I have another revision for my thesis statement and theoretical-conceptual framework...I hate this stuff, reminds me of Booty (our Research teacher in High School...or should I say Research Facilitator)...who doesn't teach a thing contrary to Gimo who rants about stuff about writing...i.e. specificity, passion and  zeitgeist...uy, word of the day...zeitgeist (spirit of the times)...and synchronicity and diachronicity...and stuff...  Literature 13-Fiction stuff with bitchy Mark Cayanan who, as the class discovered last Friday, sometimes feels the need to trot of to the Xavier-Berchmans Pocket Garden to smoke, hehehe...we haven't finished Hitchhiking Game yet so we are doing that, I presume...its a kinda stupid story where...oh well, you are not interested are you...  Block Lunch in Manang's? Well, its kinda like a block thingy na so maybe we can establish this stuff...though I'm planning to deposit some stuff na at BPI Katipunan during lunch time, kasi naman they close up at 3 something and my class ends at 3...so I have to do it at lunch...  Math 21-Differentiation Techniques with Aberin, Doc Mara's sub, who luckily only gave us practice work...  PE 131-Taekwondo, oh, I have to pratice form 1 pa pala...wala lang...  ok, since that is that, I'll do stuff na and luckily finish before um, 7 pm, because we will be practicing in Scrapyard Resort at 7 for my cousin's debut so there...  --tsk! tsk!--
