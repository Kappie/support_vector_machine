You say I lose your approval if I'm not cool like you, Well, here's a newsflash for you-- I've got nothing to lose Your laughter is hollow  because I don't care, You look down on me, but I'm not there. I've got nothing to prove, and nothing to lose...  Probably is a song and I just don't realize it.
