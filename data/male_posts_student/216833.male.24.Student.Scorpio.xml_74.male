I guess I had never been to the mall on sunday morning but here I was with others around me and the store was deserted.   FUCK!  I waited around for what seemed like a long while, I still havn't replaced my watch that was stolen in Mexico. I have the hardest time finding clocks on the wall. So I waited - with no idea what time or even when the place opened. I just waited. I was stoned out of my mind - just sitting there on this bench.   Here comes the fucking little kid, and I am telling the truth, this 7-year old boy came and sat by me out of the blue. He said "Hey Mister I am waiting for this place to open," and he pointed the the store directly in front of me. It was a kids photo place and they have some fucking dumb camera kids can play on and eventually destroy. "I'm gonna play on that big camera."   "Great.." I said. I was so out of my mind. I just wanted the piosonous vermin to scrurry away under the arms of some guardian. I hate people some times. Esp. their fucking kids.   They hung around my general area for a while as I waited for this shoe store to open and I could finally get my Diesel shoes. They had the one I wanted - I could see it through the massive scuplture of metal bars enclosing the store.  I get in and they only have a size 8 in each color. the model is discontinued. The life of a super model is sooooo hard.
