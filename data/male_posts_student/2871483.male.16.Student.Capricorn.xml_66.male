Drying in the cold sun -- Watching as the frilly panties run. Feeling like a dead duck -- Spitting out pieces of his broken luck. Sun streaking cold -- An old man wandering lonely. Taking time The only way he knows. Leg hurting bad, As he bends to pick a dog-end -- He goes down to the bog And warms his feet. Feeling alone -- The army's up the rode Salvation Ã  la mode and A cup of tea. Aqualung my friend -- Don't start away uneasy You poor old sod, you see, it's only me. Do you still remember December's foggy freeze -- When the ice that Clings on to your beard is Screaming agony. And you snatch your rattling last breaths With deep-sea-diver sounds, And the flowers bloom like Madness in the spring.  -  School is FINALLY OUT!  Goddamn, it's about time.  Then again, I have to go back up in a few days anyway.  What kind of shit is that?  Fucking Summer School.  My fault, though.  -  It's amazing how slow a week can move while waiting for school to end, and Thursday and Friday, even though half-days, were no exceptions.  Slow, EXCRUTIATINGLY slow.  Painful, almost.  Wednesday,  I realized I still had an unexcused.  Very lucky I remembered then, because it was the last day to make them up.  Only problem was I had to stop by Mr. Bannow's room and get class information for next year, which was across the school from the gym.  So, I had to run from that room over to the small gym, and the door was locked.  So I was thinking "FUCK!", and run around to the back side, where the was a big group locked out.  I'm standing there, thinking "I'm screwed, I'm screwed.", however, some very kind aid let us in.  Another hour or sitting there with my math book propped open, spacing out.  Came home, went to Wal-Mart.  Came home, dyed my hair.  Went to sleep.  Thursday, I had Band, Math, and Science, which all went by fairly easily, but allow me to describe what stretched it all out.  Band, played cards and signed yearbooks, the best class I had the whole week.  Math, had to indure Morris for one more day.  Luckily, we had our MULTIPLE CHOICE FINAL (Hell yeah!), and so it was very easy and he didn't talk.  Cool.  Science, presentations.  Jason and I kicked ass.  Afterwards, I went to Klaas's and spent THREE HOURS doing makeup work.  Uhg.  UHG.  Friday went basically as slow as thursday, only without the extended Klaasness at the end.  Afterwards, however, I went shooting with Grandpop.  It was great, because I haven't been to the 'Pits in a year or so.  I only shot a .223, because I was sick, and couldn't hit anything.  But was still fun.  -  Driv3r is fucking awsome.  Period.  -  And let me direct something to Jason for a second.  Hey, I'd teach you this song, but it has a Barre in it!  -  My dad and I checked out yet another car, this one was a '92 Tracer.  Ugly as sin, those things.  Manual, 80 thou on it, and it was really showing it's age.  Thumbs down.  -  I'm gonna be so bored over break, I have decided to play entire series of games.  I am going to start with Mario, playing every one of those games I can get my hands on.  Then I'll do Zelda, and then I'll do Final Fantasy, etc., etc., untill I run out of good games and/or school starts again.  I really am that bored.  -  Good part about summer school: It starts at 10. Bad part about summer school: It's at fucking Heratige.  -  Sleep time.
