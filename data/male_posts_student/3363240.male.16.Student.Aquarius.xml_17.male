Elan was too short.  anyway....today was: okie dokie. I had the standardized testing again today...chemistry. Really really boring.  I'm a bit ahead in my reading for english....5 chapters ahead....I'm almost done with The Great Gatsby. I am growing to like it more as I read it....but its changing from the mediocre gatsby to the pretty darn okay gatsby. I see why everyone likes it so much.  French was absolutely bleh. But I left class to see Kaya for a minute....which was absolutely great.  English...I did Leah's play today...and I ruined it. I feel kinda bad...maybe I didn't ruin it.  Next is Caitie's play. I'm gonna do good in that one. I hung out with John today after school...and he's a really cool kid. much excitement.  After school was also rehearsal. I'm really sorry I couldn't meet you after school Kaya.  Much love to everyone.  ~Elan
