Set in and around a Glasgow second-hand bookshop and the nearby hospital, the story revolves around a chronically suicidal Wilbur and his older brother Harbour.   urlLink      Having heard nothing about the film prior to watching it I absolutely loved it. The humour is sometimes necessarily slight, sometimes blatant but always completely bizarre! And it all works so well.    urlLink     The mix of comedy and sadness, at first, seem rather at odds. As is trying to maintain some sympathy for the characters when the love-triangle develops. But then you realise that this is intentional, provoking plenty of thoughtful moments and building to the whole atmosphere of the film.  Definitely one film going in my DVD collection!
