However the guitarist wasn't able to come, so I ended up singing Someday We'll Know with a friend and another guitarist. It was all so "kengkoy" (silly/funny) because we had the lyrics mixed up.. nevertheless, everyone started to sing along so it ended up okay. Then we had the Word, a 15-minute group discussion and then we just talked with each other.  And then..... as I was talking to some friends I heard everybody singing "Happy Birthday" to my back.. I looked back at all of them, at the cake and flowers they were holding, and looked around at who could they be singing at so I could sing along too.. and a friend said, "IKAW, Loms.. Happy Birthday!" And I was like.. it's NOT MY BIRTHDAY!  As it turns out, my cell mates (kasama ko sa cell group) just really wanted to surprise me.. and make it up because it was on April 1 and they didn't get to surprise me really because I was home for the summer.. and so there I was, saying thank you to everyone greeting me.. belated daw syempre.. nevertheless, I was really surprised, and it was really sweet of them. haaaaaayy...
