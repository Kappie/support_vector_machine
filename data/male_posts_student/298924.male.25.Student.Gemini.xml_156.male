Anyway what happened last week?....nothing of interest really....  I was voted in as the historian for Meharry's chapter of the Student National Medical Association because of my obsession lately with taking digital pictures with my digital camera.....I have been charged with making a website for said organization even though I can't get my own domain that I STILL pay for off the ground....I suck for that....at any rate look for BOTH relatively soon....  I learned this week that talking mess in Black Planet is not the wisest thing to do if you don't like real life confrontation....  On a related note I amaze myself at times in my ability to totally flip the script and be the monkey ass nigga that the intelligent side of me hates....I mean sometimes I just do the most ignorant things just for the sake of doing them....as if all of the repressed badboyisms of my youth come out in forms I deem as safe....escapism is a mutha....  I have tests tomorrow and wednesday in all of my courses.....have I studied?....actually yes.....have I studied ENOUGH?....no not quite  I talked to my dad this morning....it seems like everyday he makes strides in one capacity or another....I'm so glad I get to talk to him everyday without worry of someone placing the heavy (and undeserved) burden of guilt on my shoulders....  In other news I have been reading the novel Hannibal again....it is a better, albeit slower, read the second time around....I picked up on some things I never noticed the first time around....  O.J. and Syl went to Atlanta this weekend and I was a de facto tour guide/Atlanta opinion guy for them.....despite the fact that I was all the way in Nashville....I am sure that they will have plenty to say on their respective websites about their trip....I will say that my great city has managed to both excite and dissappoint me as I had a chance to vicariously see Atlanta from an outsiders unbiased perspective for the first time as an adult.....(that was a busy statement....I'm not quite sure it made sense)  Anyway, what has been put off for weeks (washing my clothes and studying) must be done or I will have dire consequences (I will be a stinky man with failing grades)....I PROMISE to update more frequently this week....for real....and as a bonus I will find someone to host my comments!  Bye!
