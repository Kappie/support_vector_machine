Some friends of mine asked me if I wanted to go and see  urlLink  Spider-Man 2   last night at 12:01am. I did, but then I remembered what happened  urlLink the last time I went to the movies on a work night , I decided not to go. I didn't feel like I wanted to stay up until after 2 am just to get up at 6 am so I could be at work by 7 am work until 3:30 pm then go to school from 4 pm until 7 pm. Even worse, the class that I have today is my ethics class. I'd hate to go on less than 4 hours of sleep. I hate going to it even when I've had 6+ hours of sleep.  Also, part 2 of the unofficial  urlLink  Fahrenheit 9/11    urlLink transcript  is now available.
