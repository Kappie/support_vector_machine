To start this discussion off lets start with  urlLink Barry Bonds .Barry is every pitchers nightmare and that story is told by barry's unbelievable walk record.Barry is 39 years old and is one of the hottest hitters in the NL (when he gets pitched to).Barry is hitting .362 with 23HR and 48RBI's.To add to those gigantic numbers he also has 128BB and we are not even at the all star break yet.   urlLink Barry Larkin .I know that yahoo does not rank him well i think that they rank him at 364 overall in ss,well dont always trust yahoo's rank structure.Barry has been red hot in the month of june he had 11RBI 7BB 2K's .429OBP .488SLG .341AVG.Barry is making his 12 apperance to the all-star game and he has deserved every mid season trip.Barry is currently 39 years ripe.   urlLink Randy Johnson  I really dont have to say much about randy he has been all over the headlines.I will just break a tip off his glorious 2004 year. 4,000 career strike out,creeping up on his 300th career win,and of course the trade talks to the Yankees.Randy is 40 years old and still as good if not better than the first day of his career.   urlLink Roger Clemens .Roger is 42 years old this season comming off a retirement.Roger has a .254ERA,113K's, with a 10-2 record.Roger is 2nd in strikeouts this 2004 season to no other than,  urlLink Randy Johnson  and  urlLink Curt Schilling  with 145 K's.   urlLink Kevin Brown    urlLink Kenny Rogers  are also a great addition to your fantasy team,both are 39 years of age and have a combined record this season of 19-3 with 114 srikeouts.Kevin is now on the DL but is expected to be back after the all star break.Both of these pitchers hang out in the bull pen and talk to all the young pitchers to help them with their confidence.   urlLink Steve Finley .I am a huge fan of Steve and think that if you have not picked him up in your league you are sadly mistaken.Steve is having a career year with 21HR 45RBI's and a .291BA at 39 years old. Steve would have more RBI's but unfortunatly he is playing with a bunch of double and tripple A teamates that cannot get on base for the life of them.Steve will hit another 20 some homeruns by the end of the year and end up with a career high of 40+ homeruns.  Now i Know that alot of fantasy managers are scared to pick up alot of the players with age and knowlege,but if you ask me i think that they only get better and smarter with age.Lets hope that these players can keep up their career years and stay playing Major League Baseball.If anyone feels that i have left anyone out of the picture please add a comment.
