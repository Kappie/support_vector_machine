Supposedly, he heard it in a Modest Mouse song called Lounge (Closing Time) and thought it meant "cut off your fingers". With that in mind, when he got mad at this girl named Cecilia* and said "I want to steal your digits" in an angry tone. I wonder what she thought he meant. Knowing that group of people, they probably laugh at, or at least talk about him behind his back. Poor guy.  I just thought this story was hilarious and wanted to share it.  That is all.         -- Feanor  * There's a bit of a history with him and Cecilia. They were in this Fiddler On The Roof play together and she would always laugh at him while he would say his lines. She also purposely tried to screw him up and distract him when it was obviously pissing him off. Now, some people might think "oh, she likes him, but is just immature" but we doubt that because she's like 15 or around that area and she's not a socially inept bloke like myself. She's probably just mean.
