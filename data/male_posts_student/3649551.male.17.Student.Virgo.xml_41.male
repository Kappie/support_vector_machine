For example, what constitutes a joke? Do people have to laugh? What if it's a bad joke and nobody laughs? I guess, then, that I could figure it to be an attempted joke by the sheepish expression on the speaker's face. I get sick of listening to the same movie moments repeated over and over. Yeah, the gasoline fight in Zoolander was great. Don't ruin it for me. Sure, Johnny Depp is a genius, but the 'human hair from my back' line from Pirates of the Caribbean can only do so much for me. Don't make me hate it. I'm guilty of this, sometimes, but I try very hard to avoid movie humor. I mean, sometimes it really can be funny. If the situation is right. Rarely. But sometimes. The bottom line is that people are simply uncreative when it comes to humor. When somebody says that someone has "a great sense of humor," they usually mean, "they've seen a lot of the same movies as me." And if you haven't seen that movie, or you thought it was stupid, you're a killjoy or an asshole. You don't have a sense of humor. You're too serious. Lighten up. Go watch a movie.
