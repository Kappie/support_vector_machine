The way you express yourself makes it very intersting to read. Keep up the postings. p.s maybe you could put a picture of Kat so we know what she looks like"    fake__dude, I thank you for your vote of confidence on my site. I express myself through writing and I'm glad someone understands me.  I do, however, want to say a bit more about why I like Kat. Ever since about 1st grade, I've always been the class clown. I'd do anything to get any sort of laughs, from dirty jokes, stupid pranks, and just being downright inconsiderate. I made friends with people like me, hence the close handful that I have today. I don't, however, have many friends at all, and I'm not saying I do. Most people, girls especially, look at me today and remember the 2nd grader that licked the trash can, the 5th grader that turned the cafeteria water green. They don't accept changes in people which is one reason I absolutely hate my school district.  The sad thing about my life, though, is people see me as a simple person that likes to get laughs, and they think because I have a large sense of humor they can say anything to me.  I know this is beginning to sound feminine, but stay with me.  To have someone that cares about you and likes you just because of what your personality is like, just because of your way of treating  them , is great. I don't much experience it at my school, and the 3 or 4 times I did, well, let's not get into those.  Kat's one of those people, and that's why I like her, because she likes me for who I am(see first post). For this reason I won't post a picture of her. She could be the funniest looking person in California and I'd still like her for who she is. Imagine a person with a personality like this. You don't need a picture.  Bye.  Also by the way I don't know who fake__dude is. He has some sort of blog account but I don't recognize the name from any of my online friends.
