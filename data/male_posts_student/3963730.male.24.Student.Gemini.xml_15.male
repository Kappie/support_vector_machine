Tell me by adding a comment here, or by e-mailing me)         I have a  2:2 , so I am really pleased. (Ihad foundmy mark a few weeks ago on the internet, so I already knew. But I wanted to wait for the full details to come in the post, in case the mark was wrong.).        For those of you who didn't already know, I havestudied  economics and politics , at the University of the Westof England (and the last year was the best one, I loved everyone!)        Of course my parents are really happy (or relieved) too, after 6 years of uni- they had thought that because I didn't tell them soonerI had a 3rd, or a fail.        (Well that willgive me peace and freedom, andget them off my back for a week! But after a weektheywill be back to normal - I knowhow things work around here!);)        I still don't plan on deciding anything until september, for what I will do next. At the moment I am still in my student job at Asda (at cribbs causeway for those of you from Bristol), although I am now doing about 32 hours a week, with Wednesdays and Sundays off. I am enjoying it and there are a lot of people I like there (I have been there a year anda half), so I will stay until September. Even though my situation is ridiculous as you will read in the next few sentences.        I had to leave my student house in Bristol on 27th June, but it was all a bit sudden - we had all forgotten the contract finished so soon, and expected to have until the 31st of June. So I had to move out without any new house to move into, I spent 2 weeks trying to find houses without any luck. It was a lot of hassle 1. the majority are not available until mid-August and September, and 2. they all want at least 6 months contract, and most want 10 months or 1 year (I only found 2who want3 months). And my problem was that I don't really want to sign a contract, since I haven't made any plans and don't know if I could afford to stay in Bristol6 months, or if I even want to stay for 6 months!        Anyway after two weeks of travelling to Bristol for the day before each workday, and sleeping or not sleeping(unofficially and uncomfortably) in the 24 hour computer room overnight (all my shifts were early mornings- too early to travel). I eventually managed to change my hours of work to the middle of the day, so that I can travel in the mornings and back in the evenings by bus each day. ...Here's the ridiculous part - I spend 7 hours working each day,and 8 hours travelling! (I leave my house inSomerset at 7.30am, and return at 10.30pm - obviously not ideal, but I like the work and it is easy, nice people, and alright money. I am looking into travelling by train, but it may not be much quicker).         P.S.  Went out for a meal tonight with my parents, sister, and aunty Ruby (she's 90)from Newport, at the hungry horse, to celebrate my results. It was really nice.         P.P.S.  I had my first red bull today, since the morning of our last exam (3rd June)- it is a landmark day!        See you all soon I hope, keep in touchwhatever wayyou like.        dave
