I sent mimi to get me some medicine out of the drug vending machine and it ate my money. I was forced to suffer, and I was trying not to be a little baby about it.  After I got home, popped some pills and it was away in a matter of a few minutes. A miricle I tell you! I have been in an awesome mood ever since.  Mimi and I are going to tackle Mt. St. Helena once again tomorrow. We never made it to the top the first time so we will get out there earlier today to tackle the beast once again. When we went out to Clear Lake and back down to calistoga, the drive took us past the head of the trail and there were tons of people parked there. I am some what glad I have days other than Sat and Sun to play. When no one is around.  This saturday, we both go to our bird rescue training. I have to say, mimi and I get along more than I had ever hoped too. I see so many couples that obviously are in some sort of economic agreement instead of a releationship. Peace, Love, and all that hippie shit from beatiful NOR CAL!   current mood:  cheerful current music: Spirit of Versailles - Track 8
