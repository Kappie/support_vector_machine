I didn't get home until past 12... then I was dumb and didn't go to sleep until 3. That's with me having to drag my ass to class by 9 AM... The good news is that the instructor cancelled class for Wednesday! Good stuff!  Oh yea, in other good news... I was distracted from outside during yoga today, because in the room we use at the ARC... you can look right down into the pool and there was a chick wearing a thong... flaunting her assets. It's things like this that make life just a little better!  Ok... things I need to get done in the next few days are:   Work on my history paper.   Do my stats homework.   Work out.    Now for some  RAW  featuring Brock Lesnar, Goldust, and Booker T... the highlights of the show!  ***
