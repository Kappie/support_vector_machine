I didn’t see her speak, but I did tune in just in time to see Fox News talking about it, and the collective attitude, even with the token Leftists, was – “What in the world just happened?” Chris Matthews said he half expected her to break out in “Don’t cry for me, Argentina” at the end of her speech. Funny stuff.  So I find her remarks on Drudge, and I can’t resist a little  urlLink fisking . I know, she’s just a candidate’s wife, but it still is kind of amusing.    John believes in a bright future.He believes he can, and will, invent the technologies, new materials and conservation methods of the future. He believes that alternative fuels will guarantee that not only will no American boy or girl go to war because of our dependency on foreign oil. But also that our economic security will forever become independent of this need.   We can, and we will, create good, competitive, and sustainable jobs while still protecting the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the health of our children, because good environmental policy is good economics.    John, personally, will invent new technologies? I know he is smart, but sheesh. But I guess it fits the template of the Left…ALL that is good springs from the government. But after seeing Kerry in the NASA bunny suit, I wonder if it is a good idea to point out his nerdy uber-competence with science. You know, if Kerry can invent the technologies, maybe he should be spending his time in a lab and leave the presidency to someone with fewer distractions. For the good of the nation, I call upon Kerry to turn his awesome intellect to the problem of conservation. He would be of better service there. Isn't it time we began working to give parents more opportunity to be with their children and to afford to have a family life?    Let me rephrase that – “Isn’t it time we work harder so parents can work less?” Hmmmmm… I, too, look forward to the day when people without families sacrifice so I may stay home and spend time with my family. It is for the good of the nation, and no call to service can be nobler. Mike and Eric, I expect a stronger effort from you two in the future.    John is a fighter. He earned his medals the old-fashioned way, by putting his life on the line for his country. No one will defend this nation more vigorously than he will-and he will always be first in the line of fire.    Always first in the line of fire? Really? Has he cleared that with the Secret Service? Do we really want the man who can single handedly solve conservation problems in a position of danger? Wouldn’t it be better to let the Marines do what Marines have always done? Maybe we can get Kerry in a Dukakis helmet on an M-1, but after he takes off the NASA bunny suit.  The truth we must speak now is that America has responsibilities that it is time for us to accept again. With John Kerry as President, global climate change and other threats to the health of our planet will begin to be reversed.    So while we are off confronting the biggest threat to western civilization, she thinks it is time for us to accept our responsibilities once again. Namely, the larger threats of climate change that Kerry is going to solve for us in his spare time. Hmm… Raving Islamofascist…greenhouse gas….yeah, I’m having trouble with that sense of perspective as well.
