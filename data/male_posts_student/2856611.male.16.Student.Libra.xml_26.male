Nicks trying to learn 'Girl You Have No Faith In Medicine', anyhow the band thing is sorted now, were playing Buck Rogers by Feeder, Hardest Button To Button by White Stripes, and Can't Stop by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I'll be doing chords in Buck Rogers for the verse and chrous, playing all of Hardest Button To Button except for a solo Nicks doing and I'll be playing the solo in Can't Stop which is quite cool. Okay now had my Maths exam today, went rather well got stuck on two questions only, thing I got the first one in the end though but gave up on the other. Only 4 more exams left, 2 RE, 1 Physics and 1 Welsh, all ends next Tuesday and THEN the day after -  RED HOT FUCKING CHILI PEPPERS! , its come around so quick I really can't wait. I'm getting quite the angry fellow in the mornings cause I wake up feeling like crap so I need to sort that out some how, but not long now and I can spend the whole morning in bed *smiles* I love the summer. Okay anyhow, should be going up Nicks later so I'll update tomorrow or a bit later or something, bye kids.
