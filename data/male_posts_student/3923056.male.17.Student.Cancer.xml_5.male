(mandela..lenin..guevarra..etc)      a pastor at my church, nicole conner called all christans to have a conviction such as this, and she called it 'righteous anger' for it was an disasistiaction with the current state of society and a conviction to be pro-active about it and change it for the better.      so why would a leader need a conviction in the first place?   well, remember how i spoke about passion? yeha, well believe it or not, that passion is probably not going to stick around forever, and when it's gone, what's gonna be there to encourage you? that's right, the conviction.   a conviction will lead, or relight the passion that will direct you to becoming a consistent and integrous leader.      i'm starting to repeat and lose focus..so i'll stop it there.   comments and queries welcome..bye for now ^^
