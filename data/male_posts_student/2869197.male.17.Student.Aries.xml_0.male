We were discussing the importance of the Ten Commandents, linking them to the two biggies Jesus pointed out, when the conversation turned to religion in school. A couple views were expressed but I could barely get mine out for whatever antisocial reasons that be. The overwhelming majority thought Christianity should receive some special treatment as it was the basis for our government. I personally believe that this is kind of weak. While I truly believe my religion to be true and that it is important to spread it to others (evangelization), I also believe the government shouldn't give us any more help then it absolutely needs to. The government, in my mind, should be completely impartial to all belief groups. While the only-Christian preference of the early years worked, right now we are too diverse to do any major religious interference without a huge backlash by all the other underrepresented religions. One of the great faults of the US government has been the misunderstanding that atheism is impartiality, thus leading to its promotion in our schools and laws. The government should just give us the basics: here are the big religions and belief systems, here's what they do and think. You choose, we won't judge them or you. The only way I can rationalize the promotion of Chrstian standards in government would be under the pretense of a code of morality. The Christian morality states this (e.g. adultery is bad), I found this to be true and harmful to society as a whole, let us make a law against it.
