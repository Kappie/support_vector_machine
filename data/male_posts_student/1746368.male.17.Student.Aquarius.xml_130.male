In the summer of the year 2000, I thought that connection was about to be completed.  I am sure that you guys have heard of my brother. He is autistic and has been that way as long as I can remember. He is three years older then me and my best friend. I can say this honestly after growing up with him for 17 years and taking care of him for the past 7 of those years.  My dad was still working for a sales company called Famillian that worked in selling AC units and the like. At the time, my mom was cleaning houses for various people around the county. She had to feed Chris by basically sitting on him and feeding him a milk based mixture that was given to him through a plastic eye-dropper.  That week, Chris would not eat a thing. My mom could not get him to let her feed him. At the time, I didn't understand the seriousness of this, but now that I am a little bit older, I can see what happened. Chris was about to die of starvation. My parents had accepted the fact that we might lose Chris.   Something miraculous happened though. Our neighbor, Patty, came over one afternoon to talk with my mother and she made a little suggestion. My mom said that she said "Maybe Chris just wants to feed himself" (something to those words) and my mom just felt in her heart that that was it. My mom started writing a recipe to give Chris many of the protein and nutrients he couldn't get before and she added it all in with a juice base. This is the amazing and miraculous thing: It worked. Christopher started eating again.  But that's not it. No, because nobody can outdo God, except God Himself. We knew that God had spoken through Patty, but another miracle was about to happen. My parents took Christopher to the hospital and I spent the night over at the Jenning's (Patty and her family) house. I'm usually pretty happy with my friends, but that night, I wasn't. I could feel that something wrong was happening. I just didn't know what.  My mom and dad took Chris to the emergency room to see if it was safe to keep him at home. The blood tests came back and praise the Lord everything was  NORMAL .  None of this should have been. His levels shouldn't be normal. He hadn't eaten for a week, but lo and behold, they were fine.  Of all the things that drove me away from Christ, this had to be the major decision in driving me back to Him. It took a full blown miracle in my life to see just how powerful God is. While I didn't start to earnestly seek Him until 10th grade, I know this planted the seed.  As I was walking past my brother's room, after asking my mom a few questions about that day, I see Chris, sleeping there in his room. Healthier then he had ever been. I praise the Lord for His grace. He is fantastic and I hope that God continues to work in my life through Christopher.   As I sit here, almost at tears, I realize why God did what He did. God could have called Chris back to heaven, to be with Him, forever whole. I know though, that that would not make me, me. Chris has taught me more then any human being ever has. He has taught me patience and compassion, understanding and joy. I feel complete with him because of his close connection to God.  Christopher is my brother. He is handicapped, and I know that God wanted Him to be that way to reach this soul of mine.
