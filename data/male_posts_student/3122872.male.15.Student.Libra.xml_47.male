Testing...1...2...3  Right, the name "Blog" is about as random as this post is. The term, "Blog" generally makes me think of a mess, in particular mashed potatoes. This is *probably* what this blog is about, mashed potatoes, perhaps some of the games Black Ghost is making will include a mashed potatoe fight.  But I shall be writing articles, possibly reviews if James can get a decent flash game/movie up :P. Oh, and RPG designing, my specialty, ripping gfx from other games. Oh, and surfing the large large net for useful things to add to the site. Oh yeah, I'm the master of Invisionpower Board forums, giving me admin powers means you get the most out of your forum, trust me :D  "It is equally offensive to speed a guest who would like to stay and to detain one who is anxious to leave." -Homer.
