I wrote the other day before our trip to the Culinary Institute as a summer associate event, but didn't say anything about it afterwards, mostly because the food wasn't that good, and I didn't really think about it.  But I've had a request for more about it, so I'll see what I can do.  Notes on the culinary institute:  (1) They gave out paper chef's hats.  On the way out, I noticed they sell the hats.  These hats should maybe sell for $2.  Maybe.  They sell them for $15.  Crazy people, these culinary institute people.  (2) So they served us some appetizers, and then ushered us into some rooms where we were split up to prepare dinner.  I ended up having to squirt pesto from a tube into a hole they made inside raw chicken breasts.  This is as foul (I mean fowl) as it sounds.  Other people got to put strawberries in a blender.  How I ended up with my job is just the luck of the draw.  (3) The meal took a long, long time and wasn't particularly good.  The event was ok fun, not great fun, but ok fun.  I wouldn't hire someone from the culinary institute if I was opening a restaurant though.  Sorry.
