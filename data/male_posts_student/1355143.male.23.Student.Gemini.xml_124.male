He's absolutely amazing, and he's taking the American political world by storm. He was virtually unheard of when he won the Illinois primary in March (this basically means that he was chosen as the person whose name goes on the ballot on the Democrat side), but he still beat the other 6 candidates by over 30 percentage points. Then he was asked to deliver a speech at the Democratic National Convention last week in Boston, and man did he deliver (speech available for free on iTunes, along with all of the other speeches). He had the US abuzz for several days, and then I found out while at the pub last night that he was speaking at my uni this morning at 8 in a very intimate setting. I got up early and went, and I was not disappointed. He's witty, well-spoken, and represents the America we aspire to be yet often come up short of. His father is from Kenya, his mother is from Kansas and he grew up on the south side of Chicago, and for those of you not from the US, just take my word that that's not your everyday combination.  He rose from a "dodgy" neighborhood to attend Harvard Law, and he now teaches constitutional law at the University of Chicago, one of the top 5 law schools in the US. He's black, he's white, he's educated, he's working class and he's white collar. Many are predicting that the Democratic party is just priming him for the presidential nomination in 2012. It's about time we had an immigrant president, a black president, a president from Chicago (not Texas)! Sorry to write so much about American politics here, but Ulli loves it. I know you guys have probably never heard of Barack Obama, but you will.  A Democrat from Illinois when meeting with President Bush a little over a year ago had to explain (speaking very sloooowly and cleeeearly) that the button she was wearing said "Obama" and not "Osama," to which Bush replied, "I've never heard of him." She quickly advised him, "You will, Mr. President, you will."  Sidenote: A woman in my hometown, the wife of a policeman, currently has 2 kids under age 7, and is expecting quintuplets. Her husband is about to ship out to the war in Iraq, a war we shouldn't have been in in the first place. It's families just like these all over the US that are suffering for George W. Bush's mistakes.  (This message has been sponsored by the frustrated ravings of Tim French, and is in no way affiliated with the Democratic Party)  Tim
