Oh yeah, whats the deal with all those road counter things you drive over???? They are on Highway 14 from I-5 all the way to the 164th exit. Is Big Brother trying to get info from us???? There were a lot of highway pigs on the road too.   Remember, the government is always trying to get information from its citizens all the time, almost at any costs. Dont believe me, then check out this site if you thought the internet is unchecked.   urlLink FBI's Info Stealing Program
