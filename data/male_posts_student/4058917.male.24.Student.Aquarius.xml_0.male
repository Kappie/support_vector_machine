My fiance and I spent so much on her care, but it's worth it. Bouncy is like a daughter to us. Hopefully she'll live a long life.      Tomorrow I will be going to Country Mazda to have some warranty work done on my car. Basically the rear bushing broke and the muffler has two 1 inch cracks on the tip. Hopefully they don't try to deny it. If they do, I will give them so much trouble that they'll think twice about denying me again. I may use a law called "Holder in due course." Basically, I will need to notify my bank, Mazda, to let them know that I will be applying this law until they honor their warranty. Under this law, I will deposit my monthly payments on a separate checking account until the problem is fixed. So basically Mazda won't get any of their money until the problem is fixed. I'm sure the dealership will be in a lot of trouble if I do use this law.
