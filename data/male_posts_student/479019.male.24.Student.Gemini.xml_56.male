I've had  Bigwig 's  Invitiation to Tragedy ,  Lars Fredericksen  the Bastards , and  Guttermouth 's  Covered With Ants  sitting on my drive for a while, but it's only now that I've ID3-ed them and put them into my main MP3 directory.  I'm currently at 2299 MP3s fully ID3-ed. That includes artist name, album, track #, year released, and album cover art. I'm like totally anal like that. But hey... with that many MP3s you need to be organized.   I'm kind of irratated that when I desinstalled Morpheus that I accidently removed my download directory. That really set things back in that I had some  Black Sabbath ,  Skid Row ,  Radiohead ,  Pulley , and  Down by Law  amongst other scattered songs in there. Now I need to redownload all that shit. Hopefully I can find it all again.  ***
