Currently favor a good deal of Hard/prog/pop-goth/soft rock and all sorts of bizzare electronica (trip-hop, IDM, trance, techno). Also, big fan of more classic contemporary and not-so-contemporary classic. Jazz always has a place there. Now I'm back to the "I listen to everything" stage. I try to write in equally as many genres. The playlist I listen to most often (during the summer) includes too much "Smashing Pumpkins," "Lemonheads," "Fountains of Wane," "They Might Be Giants," "Beatles," Billy Joel, "King Crimson," "Air," "The Clash" (bleah) and "Beck" (yeahbuddy!) and some other stuff including teh my originals. Now repeat that all in one breath.     That's about it.
