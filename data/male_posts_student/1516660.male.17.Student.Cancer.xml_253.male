I never realized how many clothes and little space I have. Have to roll and squeeze my clothes. My!   I learnt another cruel fact of life. Custom officers are very corrupt. My mother told me to bribe them if nesscary. Even XC says so. Moreover, you will have to pay taxes if you brought more than 5 sets of clothes You have to pay taxes if you brought in a lot of money. Even your pen could be taxed. What the *toot*! I was scared you know. Either pay taxes or pay bribes. I am NOT bribing anyone, esepcially idiotic corrupt officers. It's against my conscience to do so. However, Wendy said she would bribe if she were me. Sigh. I don't want to bribe. I am having second thoughts of going to Malaysia....if I have to bribe.  I got another worry. What if the train crashes? Then how?! Oh god! I am such a worrywart. What if I meet  things ? Sigh....  Wendy said to enjoy and have fun. Don't be worried so much. She's right you know. I shouldn't be worrying about this and that. I shoulda be going to Malaysia with a happy mood. I'll try.  I gotta be going le. Cook some noodles for myself, then prepare and meet CQ later. Yeah. That's it. See ya around, blog. Byes!!
