It's about these college kids, and they start a club where they get together and eat chicken and watch porn  (fittingly enough, it's called  urlLink Porn n, Chicken ).  The dean tries to shut it  down.  Comedy ensues. Although the author  of the snooty review of it on imdb would like a little more intellectual stimulation out of this fine example of the genre, I'm thouroughly enjoying it.  And I didn't realize that Comedy Central puts nekkid asses on tv during the day.  Butt they do.
