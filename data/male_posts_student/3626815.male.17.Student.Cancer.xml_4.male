It never hits you with how little time you have until August rolls around and you were mentally still in June.  Wait, I'm stopping this line of thought here. The idea of August rolling around and how little time there is in summer has been put into script in probably around 10,000 other blogs by now, and since today isn't "National Write the Same Damn Thing Everyone Else is Writing Day" I won't bore you with what everyone has thought since the invention of summer vacation, back on June 16th, 1842. (Yeah, I made that date up.)  Anyway, I would like to pose a new axiom: "Time flies when you are doing fuck-all." (So you don't get the wrong impression, I am using "fuck-all" to mean "nothing." Ask your parents about it. Don't mention my name.) I mean, I have practically nothing to do, except hanging around with Adam, Ground Zero Gaming, and thinking angsty thoughts while sitting at my computer, without much reason, mind you.     Yeah, I think that's about it.
