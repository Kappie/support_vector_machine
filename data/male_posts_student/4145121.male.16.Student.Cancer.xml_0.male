My mum's off to work and I'm sorta alone at home, sitting in front of the computer. It just leaves me no choice but to start thinking about her. That hollow feeling's there again, and I realised that life's so different without her, but on the other hand, I know that that's the way things are going to be and it's probably going to stay that way. Looking at the days when I used to chat with her everyday and when we used to go out together, thing's have really changed, and I suppose I've changed too. Yea, and now that band's over...I realise that I've learnt a lot throughout my four yrs in it. I know that my Passing Out Parade (POP) hasnt past yet and I'm sorta supposed to say whatever I need to say then, but I think I have so much to say that I just gotta start now. Gotta admit, the sec1 days were hell. Uh huh. A lotta people had musical backgrounds and that was a disadvantage to me cauz i'd be always behind them. While people were comparing to each other that they could play "twinkle twinkle little star" on their instrument, I was still struggling to get my Bb concert scale right. The National Day Parade my school took part in didn't help at all as well. I missed 75% of the band practices every week...including the theory lessons. Not to mention, my nationality seems to be a "problem" to my other sec1 members. Yea, they sorta shattered my enthusiasm in band. "Chinaman, chinafucker, go back to ur motherland la" were just some of the things I received from my peers. It was hard. I picked up the trumpet at first but was later transfered to the trombone section. Using a bloody condemned instrument, I practiced everyday and brought home my instrument to practice everyday. My seniors, were too involved in SYF to bother about me. I would just look in awe at what they could do but I'd just sit there and realise that I'd probably never make it. My senior JianXiang never really encouraged me either. I just get things lyk..."What the hell are you doing?", "Dunno how to blow louder isit?!" and stuff like that. Rensun was better, he bothered to teach me how to polish my slide and I always remembered the trombone slide of his Vincent Bach Instrument as being holy. It was the smoothest slide I've ever seen. So we got a gold for SYF that year, and at the end of the year, I finally went for my first public concert. I was excited, and I played and did my best, as far as I'm concerned. But yet, the band screwed up, literally broke down at a piece. I was sad, really, like...that's how my first concert became. Bloody screw-up. Yea,it's not exactly the best experience a Sec1 can ask for. And that night, when we went back to school, I sorta got punished by my new section leader, Moses. It was harsh punishment, but he put reasoning to it, so, yea. My sec1 days sorta ended like that, and still having bad relationships with all my peers. But that was the year. The year when I said I wanted to become a band major. Not that I'm power hungry or anything, but I just wanted to do something for the band and prove my peers wrong. Drills were harsh too, but I love em. It sorta turned me from doing one pushup to twenty. Oh wells, but me and my peers still suffered through it together, so we can all still remember those experiences till now. Guess it's time to go mug already,will talk about the other yrs in band some other time. Yea...it's gonna be a dry day. Mug mug and mugmug. At least I know there's some other hardworking soul doing the same. And as for Joachim, sorry dude. Oh crap, now I can't stop coughing. Argh.
