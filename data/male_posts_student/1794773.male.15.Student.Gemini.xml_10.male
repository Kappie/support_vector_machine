I dunno maybe I'm  just blind. but the Relient K concert was so much fun. They are soo good. Me and Maryel and other peace ppl were in the front row. I mean front and center it was so awesome. but it got kinda crazy cuz everyone was jumping and it was so futching hot and I was so sweating and on top of that everyone was pushing us and then we fell over. but other then that it was really fun.          I have more to say but I can't think of it right now. and we really need to have a movie night really soon b4 school starts cuz we have alot of things we need to talk about.
