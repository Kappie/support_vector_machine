This  is a news satire blog that pokes fun at the world's happenings through funny made-up additions to real stories and by completely fabricating other ones.  Text that is bold in stories is true ; the rest of the story is made-up. Stories which are drawn from real world happenings will have their title link to the story on a respected news website. Your comments are always welcome but please keep them tasteful.
