So I flew downstairs and hopped into the shower quick. Got out, went upstiars and quickly dressed. I had 5 minutes to spare. I grabbed a banana and headed out the door. When I got to my car I noticed that there were no scratches at all on from the night before. Church begins as every church service does, announcements, singing, a little more singing. The service wasn't that bad. You can tell when I think it's a dull service because I will nearly fall asleep. But this one I was wide awake and listening. Maybe it was the  urlLink Power Point  (by stupid and worthless  urlLink MS ) Presentation that made me want to pay attention. But I dont know.  On my way home from church I spotted Joel at J.I.T. (a company that manufactures metal parts for machines, and other objects.) He was using the power-washer in the shop to clean his truck for a horse show that he was going to do later in the week. I gladly stopped and began to chat. Yesterday I had gotten a new set of BIG Fuzzy Dice to replace my small ones. So I gave Joel the small dice to contrast to his MAMMOUTH V8 Beast of a  urlLink Ford Truck . He enjoyed them I guess. I dont know if he will keep them. But then I decided to go and get some doughnuts at  urlLink Hy-Vee  (which I still haven't done). So now I think I am leaving to get some doughnuts and visit my granparents for a while.
