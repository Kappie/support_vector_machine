Well then the really best part began that night, we left after church to go to the lake, we made it to the lake kinda late, for some people anyway, i was wide awake though..........lol.  Well then the next day it rained a lot, but it was all good because that just gave us an excuse to lay around and do nothing.  That day the sun did come out though, long enought for me and blake to kneeboard a little, i got hurt just a little, but it was all good, had fun doing it and thats all that matters.  Then the next day was the start of the best day of my life.  It was great weather all day, not to hot, but cold either and not raining.  It was a perfect lazy afternoon at the lake with the best company ever, then for dinner we went to a restuarant on the lake that was a lot of fun, it was just me, Melinda, Amory, and Blake, ha we ditched the parents for once.......... then when we got back to the dock the jet-ski had misteriously disappeared...........so then we went looking for that.  I didnt really mind looking for it because the sunset was absolutely amazing and i was with my absolute favorate person, so it was great.  Then when we got back, we had no luck finding the jet-ski either by the way, well when we got back it was a full moon and the stars were out...........it was just the best, i love stuff like that.  If i wouldnt get bored i would be an astrolagist..............but it was the best night ever, best company, perfect everthing, it was just too much fun.  Then we all got drunk on who knows what and played uno...........lol, bad idea, the game lasted for what felt like forever.  It was fun though.  Then today we woke up and it was another great day, except for the fact it was the day we were leaving.............i really really really wanted to stay...........but i knew i had to come back.  It was the best time of my life and i wish i could just go back and re-live it over and over again.
