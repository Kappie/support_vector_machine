When September 11th happened George Bush sat in a classroom full of kids...not knowing what to do...not being told what to do or where to go...George W. Bush read about goats with children for 7 minutes while our country was being attacked...in the most worst attack to ever happen on American soil....even worse than Pearl Harbor. And who's fault is it? Bush's fault. I STRONGLY recommend seeing this movie.  and once you see this movie you may want to do something about it.
