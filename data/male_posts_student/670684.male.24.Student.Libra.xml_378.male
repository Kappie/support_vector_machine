Evan's a decent cook, though he goes a bit nuts on adding a bushel of jalapenos to the brewing chili, rather than to taste for specific preference.    I wanted draft two of the thesis done tonight.  That goal will need to wait for tomorrow.    Last night, caught  urlLink The United States of Leland , a pedestrian offering by Trigger Street, the Kevin Spacey production company that is attempting to redefine screenwriting (and not doing too much with it, but that's understandable).  I'd be a terrible person to take to a film on an early date, because I go into all films in analysis mode, and only rarely does the film knock me out and draw me into the story.    Then the neighbors were throwing a party, which is cool, as I like the neighbors, and liked one in particular, but we watched a movie on Wednesday and it looks like that will be it for us, which is kind of too bad, because she's cool, sexy, and likes documentary film, and it takes very little on top of that for me to devise attraction.  I think neighbor lady is attracted to me; fact, I know it, but a note writing campaign on my part to get on the ballot seems to have scared off the prospective candidate.     Rolin fact - I like writing notes.  I write long notes.  I will write longer notes to you than you will write to me.  It means little outside of the fact that I like writing notes.  It does mean that I like you.  If that's too much to handle, a guy liking you, maybe we should tap.   But she's cool, and her roommate with boyfriend is rad, so we chatted for an hour and drank from the Shiner Blonde keg (never done the Shiner B, but it worked for working).  We ended up grabbing Corey from across the street, and I found myself talking to a girl whose first name starts with an A (Amy?), who had a firm handshake and a boyfriend.  Well, I thought she had a boyfriend, as she was kind of attached to this guy when I walked up to the keg.  Soon she was just talking to me, and quite vociferously...at first afraid to touch my arm when I said something that excited her (trepiditous as she raises her hand to lower onto mine, then realizing "I don't know you/home dude I came with is looking at us), but slowly that ended.  She was also an ear talker; it wasn't the loudest of parties, but she found it necessary to speak into my ear...maybe I've got a good ear.    The conversation stops and starts several times due to bathroom breaks, interruptions, phone calls to hear neighbor with boyfriend's cell ring of Wham!'s  Careless Whisper , and to be honest, I didn't like the idea of having this stellar, intense conversation with a girl who was obviously into me, but I thought obviously with a boyfriend.    Denton, Evan, and Corey were indecisive in support.  All three agreed that the game was mad money, but weren't sure of her single status.  It seemed contrary to original introduction, but hey, she was the one putting the smack down, what reason did I have to think she had a beau other than five minutes of idle standing next to a guy.    Conversation continued.  Moreso than before.  She was very excited about grad school and screenwriting, a sign I should have noticed early, as I've found no luck with girls who are turned on by my status as a writer.  She really wanted to read my work...and then she talked about drama and singing and operas she liked...all the while, calling me dude and nervously playing with the hem of her skirt.    She was a proficient weed-smoker.    At some point, about 90 minutes into our triumverate of conversations, I was trying to feel out something about her connection to the party.  I had forgotten about early stand next to guy, as she hadn't looked at him ONCE since she had seen me.  Neighbor I had/have a thing for was throwing the party for the UT Madrigals, a dinner theatre (yes) group on campus that has never done The Greater Tuna (as I found out on that fateful Wednesday...maybe mentioning Greater Tuna was enough to lose me any stock I had developed earlier).  Since sexy nervous talkative into me pot smoking girl was a singer at Texas Tech who loved opera, maybe she was in this dinner theatre.  But she was friendly with neighbor with boyfriend, so I just asked what her affiliation with the party was...at the most, a subconscious way to find out if she was boyfriendly with stand next to guy.    She sighed.  Looked down, the first loss of eye contact with my face or ear in 90 minutes.  "Well...um...I kind of came with (insert guy's name here...I honestly don't remember...I was well on inebriation road)...and I know Katie."    And I didn't think anything of it.  Really.  Because she wasn't looking at him, she wasn't talking to him, and this was way too close to be with a random guy from a party that you don't know many people other than your boyfriend at.  Conversation continued, hitting George Bush, my thesis (which she loved the idea of...she was a fan of most what I pitched, making the fatalist ending of the night that much more succinct), and political documentary.  Then she had to pee.   I'll be right back.   Denton wanted to leave...he didn't know folks, he was drunk, there wasn't any weed going around.  at this point.  But he saw my success and commented on it, mentioning what the idea was with stand next to guy.  So we asked around, and found out that she was dating him.  I made a quick exit to my house for 10 minutes to kill conversation, got back, and didn't say another word to her.    But that wouldn't be the truth.  She was talking to stand next to guy now, standing like she had before.  I ended up talking about Wham! with neighbor with boyfriend, who didn't believe that  Careless Whisper  was a Wham! song, thinking it was only George Michael (because it's on his Greatest Hits).  I wanted to prove her wrong, and was given permission to find the information on the internet in her room.    Enterance into her room interrupted a conversation between sexy nervous talkative into me pot smoking girl and stand next to guy, where I heard girl say, "I don't think I did anything wrong!" and guy say, "Well then why do I feel bad?"    I was the wrong guy to interrupt.  But she demanded that I share their bowl.    HONESTY NOTE THAT I MIGHT REGRET LATER - When I first came to grad school, I volunteered with CinemaTexas, meeting a sexy little blond named Dana (or she reminded me of Dana...whatever), who was dating a guy with a fish handshake and cool hair who was also working with CT.  I was one of the few responsible volunteers, and was heralded by Dana for this.  I also talked to fish handshake cool hair guy, who was cool, really doped out, but had that great stoned pacing to his speech that made anything he said sound like pure genius.  Anyway, somehow I ended up in a room with just Dana, who said that (I wish I remembered names) thought I was a great guy.  I said I thought he was nice...blah blah blah hoping he's not gay and they're just shopping friends.  They weren't.  Because Dana said that they would like me to come over one night for dinner.  To which I agreed.   And maybe spend the night  she said.  To which I smiled, and somehow got out of before never talking to them again.    What's that mean?  Last night, as I shared the awkward bowl with girl and boy, I was reminded of the last pot smokers I knew who were a couple and thought I was cool.  And as I passed the tools of ignorance from one to the other, and wondered if the same question would come up this time, I realized that my answer would have changed.  Granted, it wouldn't run like the scene in  urlLink Y Tu Mama Tambien  (which she hadn't seen, but loved Mexico and sex, so she should), except for the awkwardness afterwards, where I see him on campus and we share that, "Hey, we nailed the same girl at the same time and know a lot more about each other than we should" casual avoidance nod, quickly looking occupied and walking in the opposite direction.    Anyway, the night ended.  They left together, with guy saying it was nice to meet me (really?) and girl shaking my hand, capturing the events in palindromic fashion, leaving me with the realization that I had just enjoyed the greatest handshake of my life.
