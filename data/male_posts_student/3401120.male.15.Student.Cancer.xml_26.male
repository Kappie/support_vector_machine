All the torment and the pain Leaked through the cover in me Id do anything ever to myself Just to have her for myself Now I dont know what to do, I dont know what to do when she makes me sane.  She is everything to me The unaquited dream A song that no one sings The unobtainable, Shes a myth that I have to believe in All I need to make it real is one more reason I dont know what to do, I dont know what to do when she makes me sane.  But I wont let this build up inside of me I wont let this build up inside of me I wont let this build up inside of me I wont let this build up inside of me  A catch in my throat Choke, dawn into pieces I wont No, I dont want to be this  But I wont let this build up inside of me I wont let this build up inside of me I wont let this build up inside of me I wont let this build up inside of me  She isnt real I can make her real She isnt real I can make her real
