I want to be able to do something like this...  *sighs*  So what happened since I last  really  posted?  I graduated from High School, got a job at the local Shopper's Drug Mart to help pay for my rent and hopefully I'll be attending University this year for Japanese, Drama and Media.  Okay not really.  I haven't visited Blogs in a while. I don't know why.  I don't feel as happy as I usually do.  What  really  happened?  OK.  Summer has come.  I'm still in school.  I should be out early.  And my computer's hard drive was wiped.  All my programs went bye bye.  Wonder when Von will get back from her HK-JP trip.  Anything else big and I'll post it.  -ArV
