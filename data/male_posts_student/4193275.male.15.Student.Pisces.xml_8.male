The current  fucking annoying bastard bloody song  is Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing, Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell... Yeah, OK, I know that nobody I talk to has probably ever even  heard  of that song, seeing as I have the musical taste of a 50 year old woman, but I thought it was worth mentioning.  Yay, I just realised, I managed to keep this thing going longer than one day! See, whenever I've tried to keep a diary before, I've written pages and pages of whining crap for one day, then neglected the whole thing until I find it weeks later and pathetically attempt to make stuff up for all the time that I missed. I've preserved my pathetic attempts, shoved somewhere in my room, should I ever wish to have a good laugh.  That said, I still don't think anyone is actually  reading  this thing (except Shelley, who left a comment on the last thing, hi Shelley if you're still there!), and I don't see why they would want to, but i'll still try and keep it up.  Hmm, I guess instead of the meaningless rambling I did yesterday and have done so far today, I should talk about my day, today. My three cousins are here - they're well sweet, but as they are 2, 5, and 6, they can also be  well  annoying. Right now I'm "babysitting" them and Owen, which sounds like a nightmare, but seeing as one is asleep, one is nearly asleep (although she is furious that "the boys" get to stay up later than her), and the other two are watching Shrek on DVD. Like I say, they're normally well sweet - aw, especially the littlest one - but there are times when I feel like ripping my ears off and hiding them just so I don't have to listen to them anymore. Grr, as I was writing that one of them came in demanding a plaster for a supposed cut on her foot - I'm sure that no such cut exists, but I went along with it, if it will make her go to sleep.  I'd better stop writing cos A) I'm getting bored, and B) I don't think anyone will actually read this, so bye bye, Daniel
