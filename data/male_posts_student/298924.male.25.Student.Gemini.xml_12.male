Celebrating the end of the block is one thing but I went waaaay too far....I just hope there are no major reprecussions....  I think I did reasonablly well on my practical yesterday....I had questions about 10 of the answers but I should be okay, that puts me in B range which is what I need....  Sorry Dani for getting the city wrong....that means you are a true down south Georgia girl though since you repping the home of Pastor Troy...  Well I'll probably blog a little later on..for now I'm going to read what other folks have to say!
