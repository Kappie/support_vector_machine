But I can't help and wonder that if we had won, we'd never hear the end of it.  Today was the first day of work, well sort of, I had to go to the Somerfields in Royton, was ok. Had to stock up the alcohol section today though which I found hard. They have like 150 different kinds of Beer, Wine and so on, and my first day in the store. My superviser who was hardly ever around, just said put these bottles in their places. So I spent like 3 hours doing that. In the process I smashed two bottles of Reef I think it was, they were in a box that I thought was empty, the damn thing fell and smashed.  Thats all.  Currently Listening 2 nothing.
