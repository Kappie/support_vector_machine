This is sad. I know I never owned a slave...and I'm pretty sure that they were never slaves(if they were...they're pretty old for Freshmen...), so their argument MUST be based on  anscestrial heritage... Let ALL know, even before the civil war, only 10% of the white people owned slaves...and none after the war. My family imigrated durring the 50's...and by their suposed logic, this statement must make perfect sence. I am part Jewish. I am also part German. Does this mean that my anscestors were Nazis, and treated my anscestors horribly, and  as such I should hate myself for my anscestors treatment of...themselves? No, this makes no sence, and I find that these...honestly I can't think of a word to call them... are just trying to get an advantage rom their fore-father's strife. And as we all know, the Africans wouldn't even think about selling their brethren into slavery... the Europeans just swept over and conquored the place... I hate people sometimes ... they can be stupid, and naustalgic. And another thing, why is it considered rascist for me to say the "N" word, but they can call me a "Cracker" all they want? GOD!!! It just doesn't make ANY SENCE!!! You know, there was a guy who was walking in the Bronx at night with his friend, when two black guys woth knives started walking towards him. His buddy, the smart one, ran. He, however, felt it would be rascist if he ran. His body was found in a dumpster, behind a bar. Funny...
