(by the way, check out www.urbandictionary.com and search for swifter, trust me it's not bad) but those were 5 brutal minutes. for me it was pure entertainment but for everyone else it was pure hell. allison took it the worst, i feel moderately bad, for the rest... they laughed about it after. we talked about relationships, which frankly is none of these peoples strong points or in ms. morell's words... fortes. then we headed down to the waterfalls behind like Papa Johns, i forget the name. but they were cool. the water was absolutely sickening though, straight from the sewers. there was some moron photographing it, what are you thinking there chief? take a picture of some chewed gum or something productive. maybe some cutie's backside?... anything but that. this was where marcus and liz's relationship ended, but it was peaceful, nobody whipped out their "9s" and capped each other. then back to tom's house, we saw a beautiful 2000 eclipse V6. red. gorgeous. well i have to brush my teeth before that perverted old lady comes on oxygen and shows her expertise on everything that is sex.
