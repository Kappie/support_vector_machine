The other thing I suggest you listen to are three Red Hot Chili Peppers B-Sides. Body of Water, Out of Range, and Rivers of Avalon. Oh man, last time i drove to Virginia(which is a 5 hour drive) i listened to those three songs for at least an hour of the time. I've found a lot of songs that have a few lines that describe where I'm at in my life, but I'd never found a song in which EVERY WORD was talking about what i'm feeling until i heard Out of Range. If anyone wants it, just ask me and I can hook you up.   Ok, anyway, so today sucked. I procrastinate so much. I'm like, 8 assignments back in a few of my classes, and it's not a great feeling. I'm about to head out to dinner right now, so I can't really do anything atm, and i know when i get back i won't have the will to do any of it.   I dunno if i should call Will or not. I think he's under the impression that i'm pissed at him, and maybe i am a LITTLE bit, but not much if at all(im really not positive). But I talked to savannah yesterday, and so i figure maybe i should talk to will soon (if you don't know how thats all connected, you're shit outta luck). That situation is so awkward, with both of them, and i really dont wanna deal with it.    Anyway, sorry i couldn't offer any metaphors or imagery today. Pretty much a straight up bitch session, but I guess that's what these are for, isn't it?
