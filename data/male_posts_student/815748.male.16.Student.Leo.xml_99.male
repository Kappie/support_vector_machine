I would ask for your comments but no one has ever in the history of the world given me his comments after I have said that.  Tomorrow is my last opportunity.  If all goes well, there will be many more events, but if I fail, there won't be another chance.  I'm glad that, according to sources, The O.C. has been duly taped.  These days I actually like one of Arnaud's computer games, though it's actually an American game, a version of Grand Theft Auto (racing).  I've been doing fairly well, and it's a lot of fun.  Today I had my very first crepe.  It wasn't bad, tasting just like a chocolate-chip pancake.  And it cost as much as my Coke.  Speaking of which, love don't cost a thing, but it pays to be yourself.  That was actually a good movie.  I saw it who knows how long ago with Matt KK.  I may take its advice.  There was actually a great opportunity today, which I missed (the window was only a few minutes wide, but it was so perfect... oh well, que sera sera).  Speaking of other languages, on the metro today I was reading the warning sign (the one that says in English "Beware of trapping your hands in the doors"), and I noticed something strange.  In the French version, it ended with a period.  English, period.  German, period.  Spanish, period.  Italian, exclamation point!  Those Italians... a very passionate people.  I can't believe how not-that-quick Loren is.  He read my last post (below), the part about the guide-Noah dialogue, and he didn't think that I realized that the person isn't actually alive today.  Ay yay yay, buenos amigos sombrero muchachos.  I haven't sent out either postcard yet.  I'll do it tomorrow, along with getting more money from the distributeur automatique (ATM), buying a simple, functional jacket at Les Halles, and visiting Versailles with... the group... including... Viggy would be proud.  Of both things, going to the Versailles and...
