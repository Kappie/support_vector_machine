I dont really know where I was going with that one I just like that word. As most of you know I've been in Florida for a week now and I have had a great time. The old people place is kindof a snoozer but other than that its all been pretty fun. Im still in FL right now. I'm at my grandmas for tonight and we're going back to Tally tomorrow. When I get home I'll post my pictures from Downtown Naples, the beach and the everglades.Unfortunately the ones from down town didnt turn out so good. Now I feel bad for Joe, because he has cancer and he only has a month to live. Well thats all for now but check back in a couple of days for my trip journal and pictures. and someday I swear i'll post my incredibly short autobiography like i promised a while back. An example of what 15 hours in a car with patrick will do to you, ...Ryan...
