We're a highschool, not a middleschool, jail, concentration camp, or the like. 2. Students will often be late for valid reasons and proper passes, while distributed, haven't done much. 3. The Principal isn't supposed to do anything! Hasn't he heard of Mrs. Hannah? I think the man's definately over-compensating 4. Getting swept is just going to make the student later. It's not going to speed anything up 5. It leads to stupid people doing stupid things in protest, when they're the ones who actually deserve it and aren't going to help any with their lame attempts at "fighting the power."  Okay, redundant rant complete, on to business.  Thomas, that conversation is reminiscent of the monkey story.  How come I'm never around for those? I smell chicken! c'mon, some one keep going... darn it.   nothing ever happens around here   Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.
