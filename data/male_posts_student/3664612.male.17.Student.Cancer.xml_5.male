In their opening match which was also the opening match of the Tournament they defeat Portugal 2-1. And in their second match they tied against one of the best team in Europe, Spain. Now Greece are 1 first place in group A just in front of Spain by goal difference. Now my opinion is that the Greeks will go through to the final 8 along with Spain. Now in group B England defeated the Swiss 3-0. 2 goals by Wayne Rooney and 1 from the Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard. And France coming from a 1 goal deficit to share the points with Croatia. Now the Croatian played really well besides the own goal. But its too bad that the Croatian did not win that match. They can still make the final 8 if they defeat the England side. Today is in group C Bulgaria will go against their Scandinavian opponents Denmark. But the match of the day will be Sweden and Italy. I think Sweden will win this tight match. Ill update you more tomorrow. If not check the Euro Cup website. www.euro2004.com
