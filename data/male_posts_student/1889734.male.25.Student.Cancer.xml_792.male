Sure, there's a chance the AQ guys could be lying about this, but would you be surprised if the Saudi's are rendering aid?  When we talk about 'our friend the Saudi's', we are talking about the Royal Family, not the nation as a whole.  Much as it used to be 'our friends, the Iranians' back when the Shah was in power.  Yeah, it's ugly, and certainly lacks the idealism that Americans seem to prefer, but the reality is a little darker than we want to believe.  The royal family is useful to keep the Saudi's in line and keep the oil flowing.  That's about it.  We've managed to ignore the Wahhabi problem for decades, but as the nature of the War on Terror evolves, we're going to have to deal with the issue.    Another reason why Iraq is so important.  When the Saudi Revolution occurs, we need to be in a position to move quickly.  The oil fields are too vital to let them fall into the wrong hands.
