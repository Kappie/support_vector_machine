And if the player you select hits safely in 57 consecutive games, breaking DiMaggio's record, you win a boatload of cash.  Well Starter was telling me that he had a nice streak going.  It was getting fairly interesting.  And then he selected Edgar Renteria, who went hitless.  Why the F would he select Edgar Renteria?  Also, Whitey, can you give a bullet point or two on why the Atkins diet doesn't work?  I hear too many people talk about how great it is, and I'd like a few solid arguments to counter with.  Lastly, I have a SWEET story about a recent Deuce. It's too long for the Blogger and I don't have the patience to write as much as Bagel, so I'll try to recount it to Justin so he can repeat it as appropriate.
