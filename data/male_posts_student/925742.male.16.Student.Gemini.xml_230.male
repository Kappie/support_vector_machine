Well..... its a great movie that topples over others.  My dad is cool for liking Tarentino.  Also, I am going to be filling out a position for my underlings when Keith F. leaves. Thats right, guys (or girls, I mean, if you really want to get your hands dirty) YOU WILL BE GETTING A JOB AT EMPIRE STORAGE.  Advantages:  Flexible hours, Friendly boss, simple tasks that take hours to do.  Getting paid.  Disadvantages:  Gary when he ignores what you say, simple tasks that take hours to do, getting paid to little at times.  Yes, Gary pays you a little low, but its worth it for the hours.  Plus, here, you can do pretty much what you do on the weekends at work.... like... mowing... weeding/whacking... eating food... counting boxes...taking inventories.... and accounting (cept he only likes me to do that)!  Also, the obligatory killing small vermin and cleaning out units and picking up trash (one of the shittier jobs I'm gonna have you do).  Workers need to have little or no back pain, must have a some job experience, tolerance to physical exertion and dirty conditions,  and thats all I can think of.... maybe having a car.  Yeah, definitely a car.  Talk to me later, anyone.
