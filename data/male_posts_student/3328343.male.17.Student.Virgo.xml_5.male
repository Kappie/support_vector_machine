The turnout was even better than I thought it was going to be. We had the legendary Mick toting an SR-16 Knight with a silencer and TM M203, John Hansen with his SPAS 12 beast of a shotgun, a mess of M4s and Jason borrowing Cameron's M1A1 Thompson. We started off with a nice game of elimination set at 15 minutes which was a good warmup. Then we moved on to VIP which was pretty cool. Then later on we started playing center flag with a 1 minute respawn time. Oh boy! It got hardcore to the max. It's hard to explain in text, so you all miss out. We got some more airsoft supporters and hopefully regulars as we press on spreading the madness that is airsoft. I'm just now regaining regular use of my legs, I guess I should work out or something, nah. I can't wait till we play again in 2 weeks. Me and Thomas are going to order some BDUs and he's getting a sweet tactical vest, I can't friggin wait! Sometimes I just imagine in class that I have a TOP M249 machinegun and tear up the wall infront of me, that would rule.
