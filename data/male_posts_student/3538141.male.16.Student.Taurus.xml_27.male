I didn't even have my own computer, so I was just sat next to a guy, who was putting numbers into a computer and occasionally grunting at me what he was doing.  Oh, and telling me how boring his job was.  Like I didn't know.  Still, about an hour in, I made my excuses to him and the HR girl and left, chin up.  That's the way.  One thing I need to learn, though, is how to walk into an office, or wherever, and tell whoever it may be, in a most polite manner, that I don't like them, I don't like what they're doing and for that reason I'm going and not coming back.  It's a true art, I'm sure.
