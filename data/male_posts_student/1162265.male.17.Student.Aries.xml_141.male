I intentionally tried to shut off my psyche, and it worked more or less.  The problem with not having any rational thought is that nothing really goes into memory.  I did the process twice because I barely remember the first time.   It was in short, me straining my arms first, and then getting light headed, and then tensing all my muscles towards my lungs and then standing up and whhooosh. I'm out.  It was alot like how we'd pass out at camp, but this time it had a purpose.  I remember thinking as I held my breath and lay on the bed that it wasn't working.  Then something, something I couldn't remember the insant I regained consciousness.  It was something in a circle of blackness both times, and I know it was something material, but because of the fact that my normal brain processes weren't going on I retained none of it, other then knowing something important happened.  Pretty strange, and apparently not the way to retain much of anything.  Anyone who does weed, should try it, and see if it's anything like it.
