I had McDonald's on my break and almost threw up after. Gotta break the habit and stop eating there. So gross.... Hey that reminds me I've been meaning to rent Grosse Point Blank for awhile now. Great movie if ya haven't seen it go rent it now... That is unless you're going to the Rogers by my house in which case wait til some other time. Beat Tony Hawk 4 before work...yeah I'm starting to realize why I be on the single side... I saw some friends of mine at McDicks and got invited to go partying sometime this week. Probably not gonna happen as usual but hey it's the thought that counts right? Heh I've been listening to the College dropout album by Kanye West as I typed this and a funny little interlude came on.  "Now beat that and your mother says go to college so you finish college and it's wonderful. You feel so good. And after al lteh partying and crazy and don't forget that drug habit you picked up at school hanging around your peers HEY now you'll get that 25 thou job a year and you'll spend all your money on crack cocaine. But it'll be your money. No more borrowing from mom or my hide. So now you get your degree tattooed on your back you're so excited about it. If you continue to work at the Gap after several interviews (OH MY GOD!!) You'll come in at an entry level position. And when you do that if you kiss enough ass you'll move up to the next level. Which is being the secretary's secretary!!! And boy is that great. You get to take messages for the secretary who never went to college she's actually the bosses niece. So now you're part of the family. You know what college does for you? It makes you really smart man. All you kids wanting to talk at the back of the class NOT ME I listened ok I was a hall monitor this was meant to be. Do you know how many extra classes I took? Extra classes extra classes. NO I've never had sex but you know what my degrees keep me satisfied. When a lady walks up to me and says "Hey you know what's sexy?" I say "No I don't know what it is... but I bet I can count up all the change in your purse very fast."  It's funnier when ya hear it I'll admit. But it's still amusing.  Wow was that a waste of time. Isn't that the story of my life eh?  So now that I've wasted some more space and air I guess I shall depart and do what I do every night...Try to take over the world!!!! Or just you know....Go to sleep...
