Strange if ya know me, strange even if you don't!  Well *yawn* good mornin' to all you skanky bitches anyway!  Whats up?  Prolly not you guys, cuz its too damn early to be awake!  Dunno why I'm up, but I caught my forty winks and shit, and I'm up, you know, and ready to go!  Hey, that rhymes!  Duh, dumbshits!  Right, gotta make a correction.  I guess  Blogger  lets you choose if you wanna put a title on every blog you post or not.  I thought it was just somethin' they decided to add to every blog, but I guess not.   Nick  musta enabled it on the  T.E.W. , cuz I sure as hell didn't!  I also read the previous posts after I made a new blog this mornin' for the T.E.W. and I remember vaguely (...Shit, already!?  Damn, I've got a bad memory!)  Nick  mentionin' some shit about titles.  Oh yeah,  Nick , your welcome for the nice little comments about me.  'Preciate it.  Haha, yeah, I guess I'll give you my thanks later...or never...whichever  happens you know?  Anyway, I got a brand new story to tell about the horrors of society!  I would like to call it  "The 'Authority' of Rent-A-Cops" .  Rememeber kids, I used the word "authority" looser than a $2 crack whore, and thats sayin' somethin'!  See, once upon a Saturday night, me and my sisters,  Chu-chi  and  Stacie , and  Stacie's  boyfriend,  Ryan , headed out to the city of  Orange  to hang out at the  Block .  For those of you who aren't familiar with  the O.C.  (haha that show is so retarded), the  Block  is a big outdoor mall thing.  Pretty fuckin' awesome too.  Anyway, its kinda late, around ten or eleven, you know.   Ryan  and  me  happen to be minors, and these fuckin'  Rent-A-Cops  come up to us and ask us what we're up to.  I was thinkin',"What the fuck?"  They proceed to ask us if we're 18, and well we said "No" not really thinkin' that theres a problem with bein' under 18.   Chu-chi , who is like 22 years old, comes up and says "They're with me."  I guess it makes it perfectly legal that we were out then, since we were under the supervision of someone 21 and over.  So we just went off on are merry little way, passin' kids up that are our age (17, 16, and even younger!).  Anyway, you should know, that there are tons of kids our age (or well young people if you are older and happen to stumble on this) walkin' around and there are tons of places they would hit too, like the  Vans Store , complete with skatepark, the  No Fear Store , personal fav of mine...and then a  Gameworks-type  place.  You know, an arcade and shit...Anyway, we happened to go to the arcade...and lemme tell ya, there were fuckin' kids like way younger than us, prolly with their parents, but still the ones runnin' around the place...well...I doubt Daddy and Mommy could keep up with them.  But yeah, they were there, teenagers were there, everyone was fuckin' there.  Not a bad choice of games either!  Anyway...we have are little fun and games then head out, cuz we are goin' home.  As we're walkin' toward one of the many entrance/exits of the  Block , we see the  Rent-A-Cops   patrollin' the place likes its a fuckin' ghetto.  They spot us and say "You havta leave," and since we're on our way, we just keep goin'.  Then one of 'em asks me,"Didn't we talk to you before?"  I was like, "Yeah," and kept walkin'.  But  Stacie , who is very confrontational, proceeds to get in an argument with the group of grown-up, big bad  Rent-A-Cops ...Fuck, she has more balls then I do!  Anyway, she's complainin' that they are harassin' us...which is damn true!  Cuz there were tons of dudes and chicks walkin' around that were our age!  Anyway, some dude from a bar yells,"Throw 'em in juvie, throw 'em in juvie!"  That fucker pissed me off...sayin' that to my sister, and plus she's 18, perfectly legal to be out!  I wanted to yell somethin' back, but I find it better if I keep my fuckin' mouth shut.  Yeah, so we're leavin'...and those scumfuckers follow us out!  All the way to our car!  And they had the  Rent-A-Cops-on-Wheels  check if we were leavin' for sure.  What the fuck are we gonna do!?  Well, as pissed off as we were, we woulda done a lot.  Anyway, whats the moral?  Well, shows how much people love to flaunt their authority around...those dumbshits didn't have anythin' better to do then pick on some kids just out havin' fun.  Seriously, what was our crime?  Why did we get approached and not any other kids?  Discrimination?  Maybe.  Harassment?  Hell yes!  Like we didn't hear them the first time!  Arrgh, even re-telling the story gets me worked up!  Anyway, we'll branch off more on this later...More to come!
