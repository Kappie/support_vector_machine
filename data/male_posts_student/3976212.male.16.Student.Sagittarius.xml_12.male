He yelled once again about parking at the grochery store even though it was totally perfect (you just had to see it). I was with him for maybe 5 minutes in the store and I already had a horride headache. When we where half done I walked over to take a look at the new arena. I took a tylenol and then went and sat in the car. I'm making a hamburger patty now and am prolly gonna go for a bike ride afterwards. Besides that, I talked to dave, grandma quickly aswell as called for UPS to pick up the dell keyboard. Talking about computers, my server/radio station will not be online in the next while because the windows is totally fucked up. I reinstalled xp and it still doesnt work..i might just install linux.
