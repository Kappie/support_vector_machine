I realize that Tarantino is very much an acquired taste, but I honestly believe there's a lot to like in this film. The first one is mostly about images, but the second one is mostly about dialogue and ideas. I was also reminded that there's a lot of room for sequels, should Tarantino ever choose to make one. And he's hinted he might. These are the unanswered questions from the first two films, as I see them:  * What happened to Vernita Green's daughter, whom the Bride told "When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting"? She might come after the Bride, but she might also come after her daughter, who would be the same age.  * What great crime did Bill commit, in Hattori Hanso's eyes, that would make him break his oath in order to forge a sword to kill Bill?  * Now that O-Ren is gone, who is the leader of the Yakuza, and how do they deal with those who slay their leaders?  * What happened to Elle Driver; did she survive the trailer with the black mamba? If she did, she'd certainly have it out for the Bride.  * Did Bill see through Elle's lie about the nature of his brother's death? If so, would he have put a price on her head before he died himself?  * Why did the DVAS apparently disband shortly after the Bride's "death"? Vernita, O-Ren, and Bud, at least, all apparently went their separate ways. Bud alludes to an argument and falling-out with his brother, but that's all we know.  * At the time of Bill's death, was his organization still in operation? It could be that he disbanded the DVAS and retired to raise his daughter; but it's also possible he went through new batches of them on a regular basis, a bit like Charlie's Angels. If so, are there more students of assassination (or even ex-lovers) out there who might have it in for the Bride?  * Did Bill also know the Five-Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique? If so, who else might Pai Mei have taught it to?
