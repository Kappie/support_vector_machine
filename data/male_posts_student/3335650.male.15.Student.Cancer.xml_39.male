Are you gonna be in fulford again today? I really like bein with you guys, you're all so nuts, unlike the girls in our class, who either decide for no reaaon to be pissed off with me, or are just toooooo sane for me when they aren't pissed off with me! I should have some pics of Jordan somewhere...  For those of you who don't know whi he is, he's this random kid, who skates. An example of his randomness: I skate over the jumpbox and nearly hit him, and he stands in front of me, and says, in a deranged voice, "Hello and welcome to Norway, if you look on the right, you'll see a giant hedgehog, eating pineapples!" Anyways, I'm off now! LoZ   urlLink The Pencil Case
