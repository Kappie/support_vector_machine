Dictionary.com defines the word conserve(the base word of conservative) as: To protect from loss or harm; preserve.  In that case, I may be liberal (\Lib"er*al\, n. One who favors greater freedom in political or religious matters; an opponent of the established systems; a reformer;) but I can tell you, there are some things that I would like to conserve the shit out of.  My ass and my freedoms, for starters.  We liberals as a group have been so completely cornered, that it is no longer a matter of advancing our causes, but one of maintaining(conserving) the ground we have already won.  Perhaps the "conservatives" should re-label themselves the "voracious" (marked by boundless greed).  Food for thought. Definitions thanks to  urlLink Dictionary.com
