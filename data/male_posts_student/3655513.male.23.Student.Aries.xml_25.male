Of course, living in the capitolistic society that we do, there is a website that advertises for people to swap items for an invite to the magic email accounts. I understand the appeal. 1GB email storage with 10MB attachments is unheard of in the free email world, and for the computer literate, a definate boon.  Needless to say I have shamelessly taken advantage of www.gmailswap.com and posted many lucrative sounding offers to see what kind of response I could get. It took 5 mins. Only 5 mins to get my first invite. Not bad, eh?  Anyways, I will let you all know the final outcome, and whether or not I end up with a gmail account. This should be fun. At the very least it is an interruption from my everyday routine. *laugh*  Shalom.
