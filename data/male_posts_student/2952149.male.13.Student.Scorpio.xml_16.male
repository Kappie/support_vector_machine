But thats none of my bussiness. Then we went to Vans Skate Park and watched the people bail. Stacey is convinced that I don't know how she feels but when I tell her that even though I have never been through it myself, I still have a little idea she still says no which is kind of annoying me...oh well. I think i'll call Chad now.
