The first one went comically badly, but that was the resit and I'll settle for my previous C grade. The second was the mechanics paper, which went okay - probably a B or maybe an A (!). The third and final was plain hard. I reckon that I might have to resit a few exams come January, but for now, they're all over and I can enjoy the summer in peace.  I've learnt a lot over the last few weeks about the way I work and the way I should be working. I'm so easily distracted and that's been a real pain because my revision hasn't been quite as good as it should have been. On top of that, this last academic year hasn't been very focused for me, so I'm going to try much harder next year.  Now that there's no porper school until September, I can sit back and relax, listen to music again (horray!), play some games, write reviews, get my digital camera and take some pictures, watch Euro 2004 and generally be lazy.
