Well, I was inspired a couple of Saturdays ago, when I went to an exhibition of Quentin Blake's work at the Harris Museum, in Preston.        Yes, that's the guy ! The work was really incredible - including some full-page ink and watercolour illustrations for 'The Witches', and cover art to 'The BFG'. There was also huge pieces for picture books he had done, which were stunning to look at. A fantastic trip, I'd say, and highly recommend going, if you can. It's on at the Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Market Square, Preston PR1 2PP (I have the exhibition poster on the wall in front of me). It's free admission, and you can purchase a Magic Pencil from the gift shop, which draws in four different colours ! And yes, I have one. It's so much fun, I've spent countless lessons doodling with it.  I'm not sure what else I can write about now ... Oh ! Congratulations to Oliver for getting 'Tintin and Alph-Art' from eBay - that edition is incredibly rare now, enchanced by the fact that the new edition was released yesterday.   And I believe I shall leave it there. Stay safe, everyone, and remember : feeding Stilton to rottweilers by hand may seem like a good idea, but it's not as easy as it looks, if you are fond of your limbs. Au'voir !
