A brief explaintion of GoogleGroups2: (1) Easily create mailing list (2) Easily create groups similar to  urlLink Yahoo!Groups  (3) Already integrated with Usenet Newsgroups  Why integrate?  Because I want one shell for all my communications.  All three of these forums of communication center around discussions, what better application of the "conservation" feature than these exists?  I want complete integration, including navigation on the leftbar to have not only "labels" but also a section defined "groups".  Each group discussion would be placed in this section, but could also be labeled or starred as a regular email message.
