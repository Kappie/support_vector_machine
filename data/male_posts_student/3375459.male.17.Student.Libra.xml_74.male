I've been walking from Somerset MRT station to site after school for three weekdays, and walking along Singapore River to Clark Quay MRT station every day of those three days. How cool would it be to live there and waking up to take a little stroll along the river? So refreshing, so romantic, so nice  so happening...  But this trips weren't just all play and no work. No no, instead we (Archi students) had to go around taking photos, measuring our site, taking note on existing services, storm the roof top and stuff (Ooppss.. I was told not to use "and stuff" during presentation, Haha.. heck!) all under the hot sun. Basically that's all I did for the whole week.  Busy week, routine for each day goes like this...  1) wake up 2) made my way to school 3) next to the sit(only 3 days) 4) and lastly home(done traveling) 5) look through lecture notes 6) watch TV, surf the web, chat on msn 7) work on data collected from site on A3 butter paper 8) wish everyone good nite..zzZZ 9) repeat 1-8  Nothing much which I can blog about except this. VAL!!! You almost got Tara to not talk to me anymore. Val, we're quits ok? Because I almost got nova not to talk to you.
