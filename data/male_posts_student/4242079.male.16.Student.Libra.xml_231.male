So now, now I'm off work, and there is no one online. So, I will write...  It snowed yesterday, and in typical Alberta fasion, it wasn't just a little snow, or even a lot of snow spread over a long period of time. No, we got completely dumped on last night. Driving home, the roads, they were shitty. 75 all the way home, took for-freaking-ever. I only saw one car in the ditch though, which was good. Wonder how many there were by the end of the night?  I had a dream last night. I think, I think it was about God. I remember only a few things about it. I remember standing in line at the bank without my slips filled out. I was fourth of fifth in line, and all of a sudden I heard a voice all out to me from behind the counter. "I can help you here, Tanner". It was Harry Bodja. For those (most) of you who don't know who Harry Bodja is...Back in my church-going days, Harry was one of the guys I looked up to the most. Family man, booming voice, very nice. I like Harry. Anyway, I haven't seen or thought of him for months, so I have no idea why he was in my dream. The second part, Rhonda (also a very influencial figure in my teen-years), was buying something at RadioShack, but all she had to pay with was a Bible. Or something to that effect, I don't really remember. Anyway, I just remember waking up cold, with a feeling that I had lost something.   I always speak too soon. So for now, i exist in silence, and you, dear, do not exist at all...
