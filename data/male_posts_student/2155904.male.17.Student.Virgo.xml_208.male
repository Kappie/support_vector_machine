Well there is quite a bit to talk about so that is why Tyke didn't really want to blog until he was fully ready.  Now he will just let it go.  Friday, best day ever.  Tyke got up and went to Math and had no problems, then weight training and passed his power clean test, and then to government.  This was the best class of the day.  Tyke played the dad in the prom etiquette discussion in Sanders.  It was a lot of fun and really pretty hilarious.  Tyke just ad-libbed some stuff and with Dotti as his wife they made some nice sexual innuendos for the class.  Haras was Tyke's daughter and she was going out to prom with HoChyt.  All in all it was funny for sure.  After this they talked until class, and the day, was over.  Tyke and Kinker planned out the day with cars and all the prom logistical stuff.  Finally class was over though and they went to pick up their yearbooks.  Then Tyke, Amed, and Kinker drove up to Tyke's house to meet there.  Then they got directions and went up to the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Seattle to check-in for the night.  The hotel was very vast and expansive.  It was really cool.  The lobby had a little drop off where there were a bunch of meeting rooms that were pretty cool.  But it was just so big and lovely.  After checking in they went up to see their room for the night.  It was cramped they thought when they first got in there.  They looked around and thought they would have a problem having the 11 people in there because the bathroom took up much of the square footage.  But after a little bit they noticed that really it wasn't very cramped at all.  So then they decided to leave and Tyke and Kinker went out to Redmond to see if they could get Tyke his fedora but the store didn't have it so Tyke ended up not having one.  Lunch was at Wendy's for the second time this week and it was good.  (funny story, commercial for Wendy's just started on tv right after Tyke typed Wendy's here).  Kinker then drove Tyke home and Tyke's business started up again.  He had to get all of his clothes and everything together before hand just in case they were running late when Tyke got everybody else later.  Then he also had to finish making the prom mix for the car rides and that took a while.  And it was so hot out too.  Especially upstairs when Tyke was making the cd.  After that Tyke went back downstairs and decided to work out a little cuz he didn't have time to take a nap because he had to wait for his corsages to be delivered and then he had to deliver them to his friends right after.  So Tyke got the corsages and flowers and they were gorgeous.  Tyke's was a really pretty gardenia that went over so very very well with everyone who saw it, most importantly Purdy though.  Finally Tyke went down to QFC to deliver the corsages to Skippy and Tyronious.  Then he picked up Kinker after he picked up his own corsage and they went back to Tyke's to finish getting ready.  They finally got all dressed up and left to get Kinker's date up near Trewfanator's house.  She looked great and was all ready to go so they left there pretty quickly in order to pick up Tyke's date.  Tyke was like the chauffeur up until Purdy was picked up as Kinker and his date were in the back seat while Tyke was alone up front.  It was fun being the chauffeur.  But then Tyke got to Purdy's house.  She was incredible.  He went inside and said hello to her parents and made a little chit-chat (as was advised by the prom lecture earlier in the day).  Tyke showed his prom etiquette all night and everytime he would walk around to open Purdy's door and the couple gave each other points for doing what was "correct" to do.  It made the night more fun.  Sorry folks, but Tyke has to leave now because he is going to a movie tonight so he will have to finish blogging the night later on.  But you won't want to miss it.  It will be a great conclusion.  Ok, now Tyke is back.  When Tyke last left off he was discussing how he went and picked up Purdy at her house and they were just about to leave.  Purdy's parents followed Tyke and the cool car group up to Piggy J's house for pictures.  Although it was hot out, the car was nice and cool thanks to the great A/C.  The picture time at Piggy J's was pretty short because Tyke, the ringleader as he was called, made it so.  But pictures were fun.  Tyke put the corsage on Purdy and she, with the help of her mom, put on Tyke's boutineer (sp?).  Since Tyke was keeping the picture time short they took a bunch of quick pictures and started to round everyone up.  But actually pictures were fun.  Tyke finally relaxed at this point.  He was a little bit stressed and anxious for prom up until this point because he had been so busy and still had stuff to do.  They even left Tyke's house late so they didn't get to pictures exactly when he wanted to get there.  But it turned out fine.  Tyke really was enjoying himself already and the night had hardly even begun at this point.  He was definitely excited to be going with Purdy.  Traffic wasn't all that bad for getting to the Edgewater Hotel.  Tyke ended up following Maniak and they got there without any snags at all.  A really easy drive.  Especially nice because of Tyke's prom mix that he ended up being pretty pleased with.  He wasn't able to give it the focus he really wanted to but he made it pretty good because there were quite a few songs that everyone in the car was singing to.  Or, at least half of the car was singing to.  Dinner was outstanding.  The hotel had a lovely restaurant and since the group had 18 people in it, they got their own room which made it even better.  The hotel is right on the water and they have a little ledge that you can go out onto so it was terrific to be able to have the doors open, look out over the blue water as boats passed by and then even see the reflection of the sun as it began to set in the west.  This was probably the second best part of the night.  Actually yeah, it was.  After dinner came the dance.  This was the best part of the night.  The directions apparently gave some people some problems in getting there but it really wasn't that hard.  In fact, the directions were correct.  But some people read the wrong ones or didn't know which way to turn out of the hotel, but that wasn't their fault.  When the group got to the dance they first did pictures.  That took a little while but it wasn't bad.  Tyke and Purdy hopefully have some good shots together.  The group pictures weren't able to be done right away because Dr. Phil's car got lost so the rest of the group waited a little bit for them to get to the dance.  But they finally did and it was cool.  The group was supposed to show as much teeth as possible but in the end, it will be shown who did what and who didn't do what.  Once pictures were done came the best part of the night.  The dancing.  Tina came over with Tyke and Purdy to the dance floor and they started to get their groove on.  Let's just say these three were the three hottest dancers on the floor.  No doubt about it.  Tyke basically got to have 2 dates for a little bit because Tina's date isn't as cool as Tyke is.  The first slow song was pretty good you could say.  Tyke, Purdy, and Tina joined together for a nice 3-way dance.  Yeah, that was something that Tyke enjoyed just a little.  Just a little.  Screw that, it was awesome!!  Totally unexpected too.  Who woulda thought that would happen to Tyke?  But it was fun to dance with two of Tyke's closest girl friends.  Tina ended up leaving not all that much longer after that so Tyke then had the one date.  But he lost nothing by having Tina leave.  He just gained the best prom date ever.  Purdy and Tyke had some good dances.  For the slow dances Tyke got the good idea to have Purdy dance on Tyke's feet because the height difference apparently wasn't real conducive to the best dancing.  Dancing was fun.  A lot of fun.  But eventually the dance came to an end and after Tyke got all of the cameras and all of his stuff they left the dance for the hotel.  Purdy was actually not sleepy when they left, in fact she got kinda hyper.  This is not something that usually happens when Tyke and Purdy leave a place at night.  Don't worry though, it didn't last all that long.  Everyone who was staying at the hotel went back right away so they ended up not doing any activity beforehand.  But everybody was pretty tired so it wasn't a big deal.  They got to the hotel about midnight and then went up and unpacked a little and got cozy.  Although it seemed cramped at first (like Tyke knew it would), it turned out fine for the 11 mates.  At one point HoChyt came over with his girl and Blume came too.  So they had 14 people at once and it still didn't seem super crowded.  There were a few girls next door who were kinda weird so Tyke went outside their room and started flexing and doing the usual Tyke stuff.  Then they followed him back as he went back to his room and they came back with some drinks, but Tyke told them it was a dry party so they quickly went back to their room after hearing that.  Yeah, the hotel was fun.  But it was the least fun of the three activities.  And it still was better than Tyke's house which is all that he really cares about.  Most everyone slept on the floor and they all had enough room.  Everyone said that the floor was uncomfortable but after sleeping on the floor in Ashland, this floor was heavenly.  It wasn't like a bed but it didn't hurt just to lay on it like it did in Ashland.  But if the hotel was like the one in Ashland then it wouldn't have been worth the stay.  The gang did end up sleeping.  They probably fell asleep around 3:30-4 AM which wasn't too bad.  Then they got up at 9ish.  Although Tyke stayed on the ground trying to fall asleep he was awake basically from 9 to when they checked out.  They checked out at 11 and Tyke drove home Purdy and Kinker's date as Kinker had a game at 10 so he left the hotel earlier on.  Tyke and Kinker's date, who were already acquaintances (maybe not so much friends but still talked to each other), had some good talks throughout the night and morning.  Tyke, upon dropping off Purdy at her house, had one last chance to go around the front of the car and open her door and then he took her stuff in to say goodbye and thanks for the best night of his life so far.  It was just so much fun and she was such an unbelievably great date.  Tyke was very lucky to be able to go to the most special (and hyped) dance of school with such a remarkable girl.  He is truly blessed.  But after Tyke took home Purdy he went up to take home Kinker's date and then hugged her goodbye before finally heading home to his own house.  He unloaded the car, took all his stuff out, put his tux together, and did all of the stuff he had to do.  Then he talked to his parents about the night and then he got ready to go pick up his car at the service place and then drop off his tux.  His car is actually looking alright now.  The body shop place looked to see if they could figure out what caused his accident but they don't have an answer yet.  But they did hammer out some of the dent in the hood and popped the grill back in so really the cosmetic damage isn't that noticeable.  It might not even need any real work done on it now.  And the shop didn't even ask for any payment but Tyke's dad insisted.  After dropping off his tux, and getting the discount he didn't get last time, he went home and took a 3 hour nap (he set his alarm to wake up for dinner).  Then he ate dinner and started blogging what he finished earlier.  Then he got called by Amed to go to a movie with him, Dr. Phil, Macaroon, and K-Caj.  They saw Day After Tomorrow which isn't a bad movie but it's just so unbelievable that you have to laugh about it.  And by mere coincidence they sat right in front of Skippy and Samantha.  Then the guys (not Skippy) went back to Tyke's house where they watched some TV, read some of the yearbook, played poker, and then played Risk.  Tyke was proud of himself for being able to hold all of Asia for one turn and thus getting the continental bonus of 7.  He only managed to hold it for one turn which is why he didn't dominate the game but he still was very happy to be able to do that once.  But K-Caj ended up being like Napoleon and fortifying himself on the "island" of Europe and getting that bonus every turn.  Then he just spanned out from there and with the help of the other 4 guys killing each other, took over the world almost entirely.  But he met his Waterloo in Asia and wasn't able to take out all of Tyke.  Then he had every single country but 5 (Australian continent and Siam-Tyke owned).  But if the game had continued he almost definitely would have lost to Dr. Phil's massive army.  But maybe not.  It is hard to say for sure.  But yeah, it is quite late and Tyke needs to sleep.  So thanks for being patient and sorry for Tyke not mentioning everyone's name for the prom night but it is hard to be so thoughtful all the time.  Forgive him.  Love.
