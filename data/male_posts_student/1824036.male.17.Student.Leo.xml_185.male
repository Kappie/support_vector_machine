This summer I have went a few days of just running off of 4 or 5 hours of sleep, but in the last week I have been sleeping over 12 hours a night...  What does that say? Well if you think...I go to bed at 12 A.M. (midnight) on a good night...and about 2 A.M. on an even better night ;)... I sleep until my parents come home from work basically (about 1 P.M. or so). I have been running those sleeping patterns for about a week or so; today I had to get up at 7.  I dont know about you, but I went to bed at 10 thinking oh crap Im gonna be late to work, better go to bed early. However, as some may know, you cant change your sleeping patterns that ealisy...I tossed and turned all night long. Finally getting some shut eye around 2 A.M. (right on schedule for a normal day). Then my alarm went off at 6:15...  Time for  urlLink work !!!
