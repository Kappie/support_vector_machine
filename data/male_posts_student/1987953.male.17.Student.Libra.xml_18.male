She gave me two cards and a sterling silver ring with a Christian fish on it, from His Way, a Christian store. It's a really cool looking ring, and obviously not the cheap plastic kind. She also gave me a Veggie Tales plaque to hang up on my wall. These were all for our three month anniversary. We alway know exactly what to get each other because we know each other so well.   Here's a question: What was the best present you ever traded with someone else? Gotten? Received? Why?  Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike  "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose." -Romans 8:28
