The funny thing was the guy looked like he was about 75 years old!!!  Well, Marissa's roommate started "dancin'" to it and the 75 year old guy looked over and laughed!  Then when the light turned green he squeeled tires tryin' to pull out but it was a red light a block away.  That's when Marissa's roommate noticed that the guy was from the same county of Georgia as she was.  They were shoutin' back and forth to each other about where they lived and all that.  That's when we realized that he wasn't really 75 but only about 30 years old!  It was soooo funny though, y'all just had to have been there.  Plus the three of us together were all just crackin' up.  OMG y'all it was great!  But, the point of me bein' at the meeting was because Marissa thinks the NCCJ YAC's Nashville Project should work on leading a voter registration drive among high schoolers.  Marissa also thinks the Oasis Center would be a great partner for voter registration.  Isn't that a great idea???  LOL   If you can, go out and vote!  We don't need to have a second term for Dubya, so vote his sorry ass out...     GREAT NEWS:   I get to wear my fireman suit to school tomorrow!!!  Well, I've gotta go do homework, I've gotta read about ten chapters of Mary Shelley's  Frankenstein  and answer questions on Chapters 3-17!  Plus, Shonta' can't figure out how to send an email so I can't get any help from her with these questions!  Grrrr, oh well, I guess that means I actually have to do my own work.  Yucky!  Oh yeah, Jessica is really hot but I think she and that Troy boy are gettin' closer because I've seen them together a lot more.  Grrrr, but I think I might call and say something smooth and be like "when you and Troy break up, gimme a call..."  Y'all know.  But of course I have to get the nerve to do that and all that stuff.  In other words, it prolly won't happen for a long time (read: never).  George out.
