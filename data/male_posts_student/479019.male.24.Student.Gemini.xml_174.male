I left the house last night around 7:10 PM for my 10:15 PM flight... which would last a little over 5 hrs. I didn't get much sleep on the plane, and got to Philadelphia around 6:20 AM EST. Luckily Julia is always up late so I managed to kill time by talking with her until my flight to Binghamton took off at 8 AM. I got to Binghamton around 9:20 AM and from the airport I got to my apartment and checked in and all that. After some fiddling with my laptop and unpacking, I went to campus. I didn't get back from campus until around 5 PM. I haven't had much sleep in the past... many hours. I'm exhausted!  It's been cool here so far though.  ***
