The tool they were using to see it with was quite handy.  I heard it cost about Â£100    For both lessons 1 and 2 we had Mrs. Audouin because Bladon was away yet again.  We did another great poem in English by Carol Ann Duffy.  I thought poetry would be quite boring but it is actually really good (this particular poet).  After school I cleared my room up a bit and then went to Zak's to sort out his radio for him.  Me, Zak, Craig, Sam, Oliver, Sophie and Chris then went to town park to take advantage of the river and pool.  We had a brilliant time   Zak kept going down the mini-waterfall things in the river and Chris got pushed in and soaked (again  ).  We then went to the pool and this time I got completely soaked and, well, we all did except for Sophie and oliver.  Craig went home ( ) and we splashed around loads in the pool.  Zak had a few condoms which he filled with water and threw at us.  Afterwards I got out and dried off.  Sam and Zack went and left us remaining four enjoying the quiet of the park.  We sat talking and stuff and then Michaela and Chris went.  Me, Sophie, and Oliver walked through town as the sun set behind the clouds.  God town is so peaceful at night.  It was so relaxing and calm.  The coloured lights from the shops illuminated the streets and a cool breze blew through the streets.  We relaxed on the bench in town square for a few minutes then made our way down the main town road.  The evening atmosphere in town is so pleasant.  Lots of adults around dining out and drinking in pubs and things.  The smells of hot food drifting through the air... excellent!  I felt like I wanted to go and have a drink or a meal or something with a few freinds.  I can't wait till I'm all grown up heh   We walked past a very inviting cinema and made our way home. Today has been so cool.  It's days like these which really make me realise how much I am going to miss when I've gone.  I really want to make a big effort for some kind of leaving party.  Going out for a meal or a drink would be just brilliant
