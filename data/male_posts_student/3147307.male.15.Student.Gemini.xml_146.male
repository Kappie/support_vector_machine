Today, I've got drivers ed, Spotlight, and then I'll go over to the Blackwoods possibly to help Allen on an ECHO movie. Mom and Patrick have to set up for a Robotics competition here in Indy. Mom's helping serve dinner to 1,200 people. Tommorow, I leave for the camping trip (that means I'll be out of the way) and the  urlLink robotics   urlLink competition  starts where Patrick is on the Perry team, Mom will be volunteering at t-shirt booths, serving dinner, etc. and Dad and Joel are helpers to pick up the balls that are in the competition. And then Saturday, the competition continues! There are 50 teams coming from all over the country! Patrick will be so busy that he is actually staying in a hotel here in Indy because it is close to the site of the competition. Here's a good knock-knock joke (it's really stupid): Knock, Knock Who's there? Goliath Goliath who? Goliath down and get some resteth. Did you here about the site  urlLink www.kerryedwards.com ? it was started a few years ago by a guy so that he could post a pic of his baby son. Now he plans to post his site on Ebay and he has had offers up to $30,000 (one Republican said he would outbid any democrat for the site)  "I never understood the idea of camping. We work all year to finally go on vacation and pretend like we are homeless."  - from a Last Comic Standing (NBC) comedian  Dream On - Aerosmith   To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under the heaven... -  Ecclesiastes 3:1
