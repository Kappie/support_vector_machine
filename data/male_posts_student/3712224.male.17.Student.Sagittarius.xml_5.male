The song of Fate echos,    Through the timeless Void.    Eternity harkens to its call,     And hears lament.    And Knows the saddened melody.    The last song of Fate plays.    And with a heavy heart,    Eternity takes away the light,    Buries the ashes of time,     And watches the cosmos pass away.....      *End Messesge*     etouq modnar- There is no such thing as right and wrong, there's just popular opinion.
