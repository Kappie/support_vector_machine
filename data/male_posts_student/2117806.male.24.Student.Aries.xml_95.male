According to Adam, we were probably getting 4 or 5 hits per day, and that seems a little more accurate at this time of the year, if just a bit depressing and deflating.  For a moment, I thought that perhaps we were something huge, that we'd finally started moving down the path to notoriety, or at least some sort of infamy, and it turns out that I was completely wrong.  Wee, talk about a downer.  So yeah, it looks like I was looking at the monthly totals instead of the daily totals.  Big surprise there, eh?  This is why I should just stick to drawing comics and writing words from now on, and not worry about the numbers.  The numbers just confuse and upset me, and I don't need that.  Speaking of numbers confusing and upsetting, OU lost the Sugar Bowl last night, which is gonna make work a pain in the ass for a while.  I really don't want to deal with mopey football players, y'know?  We now return you to your regularly-scheduled ranting, already in progress.  ...and that's when I knew he'd handed me the secret of life, of eternal and complete happiness, and that I'd thrown it away with my luch trash.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Bruce Springsteen, "I'm Going Down"
