Then I'm going to stay there for a month and a half. I'm going to sit on the computer for most of the time, play basketball proly 5 times a week, and try to make out with the neighbor boy. He is the other person I love, even though I don't love him as much as Ryan. But, I not going out with Ryan so there is no problem having fun with this boy. His name is Benny by the was and I think he's 13. Yeah that's right he's 2 years younger than me but what's it matter, love is love. He's home-schooled, which is always a good sign because home schooled boys have a higher chance of being gay. Actually I made that up, but it's good to think so anyway.   News on the Ryan situation. Ryan seems to be ignoring me. I could just be paranoid like Ryo said, but I think he is. I got on aim and he kept his away message up the entire time and then he got back on later but got off before I could talk to him. I think I made the biggest mistake of my life yesterday. *cries*   Going away on vacation means no more marching band(also no Ryan *cries some more*). We remain undefeated sofar and plan to stay that way. That's pretty impressive when we have less than 30 people in our band and all the other bands are bigger. When I come back from vacation I get to play soccer. I can't wait; its the only sport I actually like to play. It doesn't help any rumors that spread around of me being gay though. Oh that reminds me there is another boy that live here in New York, but goes to the same place I go for vacation. He also plays soccer and he's pretty hot. I also think he is gay, but I think everyone that I like is gay so that doesn't count for much. Another thing that doesn't help soccer players reputation is the fact that at a nearby town there was a boy raped by team members of his soccer team.   I bought the Love Hina manga the other day. It's pretty good, but it's the worst manga for a yaoi boy to get because its full of women. But it has a good storyline never the less. Ryan even read it which surprised me because he's not an anime fan but I think he's turning into one. I should have let him read my gravi manga; I would have like to see his expression when the two guys kissed. hehe.   Just one last quick announcement, tomorrow DBGT.com is supposed to reopen. When it does I'll post a list of the anime reviews I done so you can read them. My boss wants me to do 2 reviews before it happens, not going to happen, seeing as I am leaving tomorrow. I will post a yaoi pic latter. I promise I will actually do it this time. That's all the news for today. TTYL
