They won't listen, but that's a problem for next year.  It still makes me happy. What does not make me happy is that the "recommended" summer dance classes are now mandatory... for me.  And only me.  But oh well.  I need it. The new SRT system sucks!  Is it happening at LC too?  I need to know so I can figure out how to structure my rant. Also it is way too hard to get a drivers license in this city.  Bureaucracy sucks. Besides those unrelated pseudorants, I have very little to say, so I'll leave you with a really bad poem.  Trees aren't blue Neither are you You know what to do So give me my shoe  This isn't funny It's really just random Keep doing stuff like this And you won't develop a fandom  That last line sucked and so does this poem so I'm gonna stop now.  I hope you enjoyed that, but somehow I doubt it.  I'll post again when I make sense.  I want to STUFF the MONKEY!
