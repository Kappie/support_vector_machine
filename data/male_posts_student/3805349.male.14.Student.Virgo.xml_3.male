We'd park up by the person who give you your food and we'd blast Micheal Jackson's "Beat It". I don't like MJ, personally. He's quite creapy. That was pretty fun.  We got back to the apartment at around 12:30 and watched "50 First Dates" and fell asleep. I was on the floor of course. No complaints though.  We got back at around 11:15, just in time for me to shower and get ready for my dentist apointment. I had no cavities, which proves that it was a waste to come all of the way back home for a measly dentist appointment.  I am running out of things to keep me entertained. I should go upstairs and check whats going on.  Peace out.
