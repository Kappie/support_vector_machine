He came and sat next to me today in history and he kind of creeps me out. He has almost the same computer as I do and I think for some reason that is really cool to him or something. I don't know. But he just kept breathing on me and it was so loud! It was driving me crazy! And not only was it loud and obnoxious, it was also kind of stinky. Oh, it was bad. I didn't know if I was going to make it through class. He kept leaning on my arm rest really close to me too. Man, I wanted to just shove the guy and tell him to open his mouth and stop snorting through his nose. But of course I didn't. For some reason that would be socially unacceptable. Oh well. I survived the class period. I just hope he doesn't sit by me again next time.
