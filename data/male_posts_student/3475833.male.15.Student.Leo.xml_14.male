Was I supposed to say, "Oops, I made a mistake, let me fix that for you?" And why should I?    I know what I did, it's not a news flash, and I know why I did it too. I have reasons. It was a big decision. I didn't just flip a coin. I thought about it a long time. I killed my parents with switching my choices so many times. I probably printed 10 different versions of a withdrawal slip. It was my decision. I did it on purpose.    I don't care about how bad of a choice YOU think it was. It was a good choice for my needs. I care about you, and I care about what you do, I care if you do well.    Just because I don't do it, doesn't mean I don't care about it. It's my school and I care about every aspect of it, until it starts not caring about me. I have "school spirit" just because I don't dress in funky clothes during spirit week doesn't mean anything. That's not what school spirit is to me. School spirit is about participating in sports and clubs, and caring when another sport does well. It's going and helping the new people in school. It's telling someone that you're from Coventry. Introducing yourself to someone as, "I'm Jeremy Hirschfelt and I go to Coventry."    I care about Coventry, that's why I live 16 miles away and still drive to school everyday. Coventry's my home. I plan to graduate from Coventry, and I plan to graduate with pride.    "In order to excel, you must be completely dedicated to your chosen sport. You must also be prepared to work hard and be willing to accept destructive criticism. Without 100% dedication, you won't be able to do this."
