No devil can have any work against me~!... for we already have the victory~... wooo~! so happy... cleared up all the things... and settle my past... things seems to be so much better... and my mind seems relieved... and relaxed... thank God~!   Today learnt something... as long as you are doing the right thing stand firm... even if from the start you have the wrong attitude... change and set your mind on the attitude you should have... and lift the issue or problem up to God... ^^...    Found The Light     Thinking of the past events, Bring me guilt and teary eyes, Feel so sinful like never before. But once i confessed and share, Exposed the devil to the light, And he never been to fight back right.  Walking out of darkness, To the Glory of your grace. Found the light of life, Which is the way to eternal.  Free myself from sin, Fresh to serve him all the way. Get away from temptations, Let the devil have nothing to say
