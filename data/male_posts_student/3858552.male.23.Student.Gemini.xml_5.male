It has rained every day since the first day of June which is INSANE.  On a better note, Jade and I solved our problem today after a near 3 week standoff, it feels much better to be a family again.  I don't know if I mentioned it last time or not but Matt finally got him a car and can scoot about freely; I know he's very happy about it.  I'm so ready to move, some people came over here to look at the house tonight and weren't very impressed which I can understand why, when the whole lower part of the house floods when it rains, oh well.. in a few more weeks we'll be living it up in the upper crossing subdivision.  I'm hoping that my finances stablize and we can get on track after all the spending Matt and I have done on furniture and other bullshit for the new house, but hell I suppose we deserve it.  Hmmm.. my thoughts on politics for the day is regarding the statement from "Homeland Security" about a terror warning.. ok.. they have cried wolf so many times until it doesn't really matter what they say, no one listens and I can't blame them.  The reality of the situation is that there is no possible way to monitor every single person in the U.S., so if they wanna strike, they are gonna do it.  At this point maybe if they did it would make Bush lose even more credibility and lose chances of getting his ass back into office, I just don't want innocent people to die just so that will happen.  Well, I'm thought out today, but I will end by saying i'm extremely excited about Brandi being pregnant again, I was around when Jaden was born, but this time i'll get to be around for this one!  Woo-hoo!
