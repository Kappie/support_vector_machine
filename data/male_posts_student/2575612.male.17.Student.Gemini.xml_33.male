The band is loud and I'm wandering the shadows,  wishing I was never here. I persevere.  A crowded room, these whitewashed tombs,  they raise their glasses high, they kiss the past goodbye.   This New Years Eve, I'm waiting for tomorrow.  My heart is on my sleeve, and yes I still believe,  this New Years Eve, will turn out better than before,  I'm holding on, still holding out, until they close the door... on me.    got into an aguement with my dad today. kinda sucked. i basically threw out all my feelings on him...church, youth group, friends...blah. everything. i want to be in touch with the Lord, to walk with him and be in tune and obedient. but im so far gone. i wish i had more and better friends. im so blessed but i feel so empty sometimes. as if everything that i seek to fill me leaves me feeling more empty than when i started. the lyrics kinda sum up how i feel when i see and am with these awesome, diligent christians who make me look like a heathen. isolated...alone...everday life.  Thinking about my future. my dad is really pushing me to think of wheaton. its a nice school, i'll probably go see it sometime. but money, cars, my susie, all these things are just bombarding me. ugh. life is so crazy and exciting. at this time there are so many decisions that will affect my life so much. i was asked by an anoynmous friend for advice...he was really wanting to drink and i gave him my two. even i feel like just drinking away my problems but i know that there is no way that will solve anything. foresight is a great thing to have, i know that the holy spirit is still working in me even though ive totally backed off. i dunno these feelings are eating me up.  A wise friend once told me that song lyrics are a great thing to read, listen, and type when feeling kinda down...   Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry? I am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind.    -Guernica, Brand New   goodnite all...love and love abundantly, for that is what makes the world go round.
