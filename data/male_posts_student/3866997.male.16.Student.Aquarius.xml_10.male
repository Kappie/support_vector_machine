I've taken alot of time here in Boston to ponder over these various different "tragedies" and see where I went wrong and correct my mistakes in the future. They say that mistakes arent bad as long as you learn from them, and I do intend to learn from my mistakes. As with most matters of personal philosophy the various realizations that I've come to have sent a ripple effect through ever facet of my being and helped me to realize that, in the words of Dropkick Murphys, "I'm not half the man I thought I'd be". I have turned into the kind of person I always hoped I wouldnt and I do believe its time to change that. I hit this realization when I was riding through Harvard Square today. It reminded me of all the hopes and dreams I had for myself when I was a young boy and that I had lost sight of what is important in life. The way I've been handling relationships and my friends, and how I've been dealing with the various problems has been just horrible and thanks to my newly acquired talent for meditation I'm feeling much better focused on what is really important. So, if you notice a little bit of a chance, hopefully for the better, then you know where it came from. I know two boys (yes, it ALWAYS boils down to boys) that symbolize these two different directions I'm being pulled in. The first shall remain nameless. He is self-centered and thinks everyone else's life should revolve around his. He thinks everyone is in love with him and believes that because of that he can treat people however the fuck he wants with absolutely no concern for their feelings. Then, there's TJ. He is very honest and open. He always gives his opinion on things, and is never afraid to challenge me because I might get pissed and run away. He's bold and very different. We talk religion, politics, etc. and I've never met a boy that would give any of that a second thought. We're just friends at the moment, but I'm open to a relationship if the fates lead in such a direction *crosses fingers*. Before I begin my social commentary for this posting, I thought I'd mention something. Alot of people have been commenting on how much they like my writing recently and I appreciate it so much. Thank you for all of your support and I love you to death for it. Now for my rant of the day: This one is gonna be somewhat different than what you guys are used to. I've been talking about relationships and such, but today you get to hear some political commentary. "We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights,  and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness". How true is that today? The Government has fucked the working man so bad its not even funny and forget any compasssion on their part for all of his losses. The purpose of government is to ensure the health and happiness of the people of the nation and it has been over a hundred years since our government has taken any action to do such a thing. Elections have gone from a "let the best man win" situation to POLITICS. The word itself turns my stomach. What is politics? The science of decieving the masses into believing you are something you are not, or making them believe something they really dont want. Its time that America got back to its roots. Its time that someone stand up and say that they are running for election to SERVE THE PEOPLE, NOT TO SERVE BIG BUSINESS. We need someone who is more interested in preserving our way of life and less interested in financing a campaign riddled with empty promises and broken dreams. Someone who is willing to uphold the ideals symbolized by that sacred banner. GOD. DUTY. HONOR. COUNTRY. I met two boys yesterday, Bryan and Benji. They are both freshmen at Caddo Magnet High School and I must say are just amazing guys. I met Bryan first, he e-mailed me when he found my profile on a personals site and a week later I found the e-mail in an old inbox. Pure luck. He called me a little while later on Jason's cell phone and we talked for a couple of hours. Later that night I convinced him to call his friend Benji and got to talk to them both at the same time. I immediately liked these two little studs and we plan to meet up at Mall St. Vincent this Thursday unless my mom or brother decides to be assy.  The Moral of the Story: If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels,  but have not love,  I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.   And if I have prophetic powers,  and understand all mysteries and all knowledge,  and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains,  but have not love,  I am nothing.   If I give away all I have,  and if I deliver my body to be burned,  but have not love,  I gain nothing.   Love is patient and kind;  love is not jealous or boastful;  it is not arrogant or rude.   Love does not insist on its own way;  it is not irritable or resentful;  it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right.   Love bears all things,  believes all things,  hopes all things,  endures all things.   Love never ends;  as for prophecies, they will pass away;  as for tongues, they will cease;  as for knowledge, it will pass away.   For our knowledge is imperfect and our prophecy is imperfect;  but when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away.   When I was a child,  I spoke like a child,  I thought like a child,  I reasoned like a child;  when I became a man,  I gave up childish ways.   For now we see in a mirror dimly,  but then face to face.  Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully,  even as I have been fully understood.   So faith,  hope,  love  abide, these three;  but the greatest of these  is love.
