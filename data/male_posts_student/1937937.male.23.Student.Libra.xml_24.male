You can't see that, because I took the picture with my phone while peeing in the toilet at a Greek restaurant called Mykonos (possibly not called that, but that is a good Greek sounding word).  I went there to get three falafel sandwiches.  Here's a tip: when you don't know exactly how to spell a word, go to  urlLink Google  and do a search for the word as you know how to spell it.  It'll come back with a suggestion on the top if you misspelled it ("Do you mean falafel?")  That's how the English majors do it.  How do the French majors do it?  With touche, s'il vous plait!  If I had really wanted to, I could have added accents.
