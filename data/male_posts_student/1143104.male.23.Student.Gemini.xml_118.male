Nope! A cool trip Patti and I are planning? Nope!  This is what it took for us to order DSL! Best of all, the order still hasn't been placed! That will happen tomorrow morning and once I get the necessary software and hardware, this process will be finished. In my effort to make the lives of my friends (that's you) a little easier and my goal of leaving a mark in history, I make the following recommendation:   AVOID  VERIZON   AT ALL COSTS!   Their customer service is atrocious, their capabilities are nothing more than a Neanderthal at Comdex, and their internal computer system is less reliable than two tin cans and a string.  ...in other news...  Patti and I had our first barbequed meal tonight. It was her famous aluminum foil chicken dinner and I had it for the first time. I will definitely request that again. Its really good! Food aside, I'm 2/3 done with installing the new tracks on the kitchen drawers and Patti has been busy putting shelf liner in and we're cleaning a whole bunch of pots, pans, dishes, and glasses everynight. She broke her crockpot tonight and had never even used it before. We also bought two new cordless phones last night from Target and they work pretty well. I like 'em and that's teh important thing because she didn't seem to care. Shopping was fun for that!
