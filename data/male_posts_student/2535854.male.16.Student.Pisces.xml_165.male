I guess my choir thing has been cancelled out...its 6 days away and still no sign of anything getting together!Well...no prefects in my class now that they are taking part in Commencements and stuff. Damn. Anyway my plan is to like go at 7 p.m or something and come home at like midnight past and stuff...hehe..Dunno what to wear yet..for shirt its either the  PDI Maroon long-sleeved shirt  or the  John Master   Blue long-sleeveed shirt  where the colours like 2 toned or maybe the  Snails 2-toned Pink elbow length sleeves ?    Oh the possibilities.Lets not even talk about shoes. Yikes..I sound so feminine!Lmao.        Well, Sashya said the Bookmart was out of stock of the Bio text book...so returned  urlLink Nik  his 70 bucks.Book can be gotten at SBL in Taman SEA Appearently...hmm..        Well I was taking my time getting ready for tuition and stuff..   Well mom dropped me off the the curb of Eon Bank and when I got out of the car, I saw  urlLink Jenny ,,  urlLink Michelle !, and like two other girls...I so wanted to meet up with Jen and Mich but like I had to get some goreng pisang for mom at the stall over next to Eon Bank, so got like rm3 worth of pisang abu , and gave the thing to mom, grabbed my bag and ran across the street looking for em...I thought they went into Telawi 3 so I went there although I was cause had Francis anyway there...So I stood in front of Coffee Bean and veered inside but didn`t see em...so I was thinking maybe they were going to McD`s so I like ran that way...and like I think GB saw me from the Gospel Centre, like runnin up the street away from the place...shutters quite see thru-able today.heh. Well I then was near Burger King and GB called and she`s like..there`s tuition on now..and I said yeah I know..i`m coming but I have something to attend to in the meantime but was on the way...anyway in the end, I dejectedly gave up looking for em..Maybe they had gone through Telawi 2 and were still on their way there?But i`ll neve knoe..maybe i`ll ask them..just maybe..but i`ll bet not..well I got to tuition at 4:50 pm instead.Heheh.Meng Kwong walked from home so he was late and came same time as me..but Francis was cool about it and stuff..In fact he didnt teach a thing yet!        Well I was damn sharp during tuition man!Hehe.Francis said so. Its cause I haven`t had much homework during the week so could be relaxed a bit and didn`t study the most..so was quite relaxed and my mind was still sharp and I had totally forgotten about the earlier part of the day and crap.Damn, entering Susut Nilai into the various accounts is quite simple actually!Anyway sat next to GB although my view was like beautifully the ride side of the whiteboard,I`d rather sit there than next to Wei Hong or 'Jahiliyah' and get a proper view though where I sat was quite a nice spot.Heh.I doubt I would be strong enough to lift a table near him anyway, the tables felt so heavy for some reason so suited that I sit near GB and stuff.        Well after tuition Kar Wai and the whole gang all at Irish Pub so lepak with them..but 1st lepak with GB still she left and stuff...me and Kar Wai talking about Shaun and stuff...said to him that GB is his girl but they are on and off...Kar Wai was like damn good only walking around with a file with tuition stuff put turn it around and there`s a Warcraft cd in the back.Lmao. Me and MK new that he couldn`t have been genuinely studying!haha...talked about the Shaun thing..he`s coming after school on Monday..He said he wants to change school but I told him..with they way he is now..he`ll have difficulty keeping up with the rules and he himself says that he has problems with Smkbb prefects and stuff that he can forget about SSC although he want to go there la and stuff...also met Izuan,Nicholas,Teng,Dede,Yan Wei and the othet guys..all at the 'only foosball table in Bangsar'.Playaz in Hartamas is just to darn far way!At 7pm theyw anted to makan...they ajak me but I was like...if I go..i`ll eat something..and I wanna stay fucking hungry and eat like a hog later at night to ciaoed home...Passed by BSC and Vishnu reminded me that I still haven`t poured Coke over him despite threatening every year for the last 4 or 5 years!Damn!What the heck happened?Met U-Waye as well.        So mom and dad are outta town over the weekend and mom doesn`t want me going out and all leaving the maid and my grandma all alone..although i`ll still go out anyway..So got Domino`s Pizza for dinner!Yay!Breadsticks as well complimenting my Extravaganza and my Vegie Galore.So i`d have left-overs and stuff so no need to go out and get food and stuff.        Well, asked Cheryl out but she was gonna be Malacca..so no Paella for us...and Sarah was gonna be at a family gathering so I wouldn`t be able to spend her on her coffee that ive oweed her for the last 8 or 9 months I think..Spanning from November or December last year. Terrible.Anyway lately helping Zhen Cui out with her blog and the template though I think ive done nothing much for her..        Anyway Im blogging at this time cause like after midnight I was on and off sleeping on my parents bed so every now and then checking on the comp and my name is like online....but ive put it as away now.haha.online for one whole damn night.
