On top of that, I'm sick and I had to blow my nose every 5-10 minutes.  It was kinda hot, and I wasn't prepared to get back into the swing of work after an entire week of camp.  I've got some kind of sinus deal goin on so I've kinda got a head-ache, but I've started working on a new Music CD for my cousin.  I have the option to go to work tomorrow or go swimming with Bre and go to a movie with Billy (neither one is set in stone because Bre may not be able to go and I haven't nailed anything down with Billy yet).  The only certain thing about tomorrow is that it will be upon the world (not necessarily including God's people) in almost 6 1/2 hours.  I'm so headachy right now, I don't know what I'm gonna do to get rid of this sickness.  At any rate, I've got to go.  Peace out my peeps.  And all the party people from the front to the back said this is that guy signing out.  Josh G-izzle :P
