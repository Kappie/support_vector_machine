Over the break I will be seeing the new Harry Potter movie with a group of classmates (yay! Looking forward to this hugely!), and a karaoke night has been planned. Not sure about that one, some say my singing is best kept for the shower (philistines, what would they know? Untalented hacks, etc, etc, etc)  Other than work, and those couple of social events, I have four weeks all to myself! Oh, the bliss!
