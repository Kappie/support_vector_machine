So... upon further thinking, I don't think you were talking about me.  Maybe, this is the point where he's feeling, "I liked you, and I think I still like you, but the former feeling of 'I LIKE YOU' or similarly, 'I LOVE YOU' seemed to have diminished in time."  Maybe it is the feeling of "I thought I loved you, but I'm not sure I know exactly how to love you, nor how to treat you for that matter."  It could also mean "I know love.  It means I can spend time with you whenever I LIKE, and if I'm really lucky (not that all men are the same, because I cannot know for sure) I can get laid.  Now that is love."  I don't really understand.  LOVE is such a stupid word.  It is the word that can be defined but cannot be understood.  "Falling in love" is much worse, because someone actually used a word most of us barely understand.  Love is a question I encountered earlier in the Filipino class.  "What is love?" is a broad and personal question.  Not knowing love is embarrassing, but that is truth for me.  I admit, I don't know a thing about love.  Probably it is the fear to commit, but I have no experience, nor do I intend to experience such "love".    Maybe "yuch" is similar.  Did you find "yuck"?
