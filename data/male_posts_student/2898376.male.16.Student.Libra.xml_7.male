After a minute or so, the driver came on the intercom: 'I'm sorry, we are experiencing delays due to ninja-related reasons. Please stay calm.' No sooner had the chime signalled the end of the message when a hundred, no TWO HUNDRED ninjas burst into the opposite end of the carriage. As I stood up and prepared to do battle, a razor-sharp sword sliced through the roof and a final one jumped through. He was obviously the leader. I knew if I could take him down, I had won. I rushed headlong towards them. The first onrushing ninjas were quickly taken out by some well-timed punches and kicks. While I took the first few down, the rest stood around, running in circles or jumping from one foot to another, as normal. One by one more rushed at me. I grabbed the first's nunchuks and threw them on the floor, then as he bent to retrieve them, kicked him over and knocked him unconscious. The second went down to a two-fingered eye-poke. The third and fourth pulled off some fancy moves, but knocked each other out when they both swung at me while I ducked. Grabbing a pole from the interior, I quickly sent the next few flying in quick succession. Then, I noticed some escaping through the already broken windows. They were going to take over the driver's compartment! Grabbing an overhead bar, I vaulted out, knocking their feet out from under them as they came past. The next few fell to a series of deft moves. Suddenly, a ninja was flying down at me after taking a huge jump. Thinking fast, I grabbed his ankle, spinning round and knocking most of the remaining ninjas away, before flinging my impromptu weapon away also. The final few went down to dirty fighting. I was just about to dust off my hands when a sword burst through the roof below me. The leader! I swung through the carriage window again, to be greeted with a sword cutting off a few hairs. 'Hey, don't give too warm a welcome!', I quipped wittily. Evidently my good humour was wasted. I dodged a thrust, a jab, an uppercut and a slash. I managed to land a or two blow on him, but they did nothing. It looked like the end. I stood still, knowing there was no chance of escape. As he sized me up, the lead ninja looked round at a noise behind him: 'What'choo doin' sucka!!' My heart leapt: 'Mr. T!!' It was him! 'Hey, this fool givin' you trouble?' My nodded emphatically. 'No trouble!' Mr. T strode towards the ninja, unworried by the sword. The ninja grinned evilly, but I knew what would happen. The sword came down heavily on Mr. T's chainses, and smashed into a thousand pieses. 'Fool!! Nuthin' hurts ma chainses!! They're helluva stong!' Mr T. picked up the ninja and threw him through a window. 'That'll teach you, sucka!!' he shouted, and with a final wink at me, he jumped into his van, grabbed some Mr T. ceareal and drove off at Mach. 2. His van's helluva fast, fool! 'As the problem has now been corrected, we will resume our journey.', said the driver as the passengers cheered me and Mr. T. I settled down with my paper, and arrived only 6 minutes late.
