I drummed after that. Then I went to my cousin's house, the Maclay's and took my aunt and my cousin Ryan with my mom to the pizza place, got some pizza and then headed over to Jones Beach to see AEROSMITH!!! Man that was a great concert. Gets you pumped and all, especially Love In An Elevator. Oh and Steve Tyler and Joe Perry are feminine skinny make up 60 year old men. It's crazy how they look like they're 40 or even 30 and the make up and hair makes em look so much younger. They have like skinny girl bodies, it's freaky but they're awesome. And the confetti and lights were great. The Cheap Trick band that opened for them wasn't that good...the weather turned out being great. Thunderstorms my eye. After the concert Ryan and I just basically discussed the upcoming Jones Beach shows and bands and stuff, then we dropped em off at their house, and then my mom and I went to 711. I got a Kiwi-Strawberry Slurpee and a Chicken Faquita or something...something Mexican. Now I'm adapting to the calm silence in my house compared to the Aerosmith concert. Now I have to go to the bathroom...goodbye.
