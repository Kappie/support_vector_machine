No. They ask u what u want and then when u look and find what ur looking for they are like oh why dont u get this it looks better. I mean then why did you ask for my opinion. Second is they always gotta bring u down with whatever u have oh why dont u share oh why dont u save oh why do u alwyas gotta ask for something u want, when i was little i never............ ans stuff like that. I mean we were in different circumstances the time u were in were much more difficult than it is now why do you always gotta take it to the past. And when ur in school and u come home from school and u finish all ur work they want u to do even more work i mean its okay to help  a little but they abuse and give  u a whole bunch of stuff i know the parents are tired but come on why cant u divide the work equally. ANYWAYS..... theres many things that i wanna say but some of those things have to be held inside you until u can talk to someone about(no pschyatrist or psycologist) You have to keep most of ur feelings inside of you because if u let them out they think ur crazy or weird.                                       Um one thing i wanna do, i know i sound like a little kid but i wanna make it to the olympics oneday not because i just saw them but i have a feeling that tells me to go. I wanna participate in them, and i only want to participate in one event , that is soccer. Another thing is i wanna make it to the world cup as a player and i want to go see one werever its held  but thats one of my goals for life to make it to the World Cup FIFA. Soccer is my favorite sport, i like playing it everytime and anytime i can, i like to watch it and play it. This is just a great passion that i have. Another thing is this is a dream that i have had since i was 5yrs old. I always wanted to go to the moon or into space that is one dream that i have had for a long time i have been going at both of these things since i was little. I was playing soccer since i was i can remember i started playing on a team at the age of 4. I dont think i m the best i just think im kinda decent. anyways i got everything i really wanted to say
