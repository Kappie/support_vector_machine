The Runebag: This helps mages to store runes and saves inventory space. As arrows and bolts can be equiped, it's only fair. 2. Steeds: Everyone has only asked for horses so far. Why not mules, asses, mares, and stallions? That way, the poor players will have the ability for backup and speed.  If you agree with this, post your comment. Much appreciated!
