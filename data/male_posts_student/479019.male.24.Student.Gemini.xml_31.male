That leaves me about 9 hrs and 15 mins to get it done, sleep, and get to class. As you might be able to tell from my procrastination, I can't wait until the end of the quarter. I'm slowly but surely crawling my way to the finish line. After this week I just have a take home final (7-10 page paper) and a real final for statistics... which will all be done by Thursday!  I'm just feeling totally tired of school. I don't know if it's senioritis or if its the workload this quarter. I hope I recharge my batteries over spring break and I'm ready to go for my last quarter at UCI. It's hard to believe it's almost over.  **
