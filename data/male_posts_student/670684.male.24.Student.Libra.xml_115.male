Granted, a lot of these bands were cult favorites (Devo, Soft Cell), while others were side projects (Frida was from Abba, Joey Scarborough was a jingle singer who got lucky with The Greatest American Hero), and some of the names included are preposterous (Peter Schilling with only one hit?!  The Mary Jane Girls in the same way?!) but the collection of names that are so forgettable is amazing!  I mean, who remembers Rocky Burnette and  To'ing The Line ?  Or even Hayzee Fantazee?  Incredible!  More on my favorite music decade...I was at a Sam Goody on Wednesday with Brian when I saw  urlLink this  album.  I can understand U2, The Moody Blues, George Clinton  Parliament, hell, even Tony Orlando all on the Columbia Essentials label, but Twisted Sister?!  I hate to comment on items bombarded by the national media, but this Great White disaster in Rhode Island begets a question.  You're Great White, an 80s hair band that tours in small clubs.  Small clubs.  You get booked in the equivalent of a wooden barn that has maybe a 15 foot ceiling at the most, and you're on a stage 2 or 3 feet high.  Yet you set up Flash Pots that shoot flames 20 feet in the air?!  If I'm paying to go see Great White in concert, I don't give a shit about flash pots...there's got to be something else that is driving me to that concert.
