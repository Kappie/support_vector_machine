My eyes burn twenty-four seven and my brain keeps shutting down.  I don't feel happy.  Not really... I feel tired.  I feel stressed.  I feel burning.  Can I finish the amount of units I need to?  Yes, but that will come at a large sacrafice.  I guess I should think about that later.  This weekend was...  +++ANIME NORTH+++  It was fun.  It was tiring.   My Notable Events   Karaoke Curse of the Fanboys Voice Acting Contest Q with Atsuko Enomoto   Karaoke  - Rei and I were supposed to do a duet to "Moment".  Unforunately they couldn't find a CD.  As a (litterally) last minute backup, Rei chose Tooi Kono Machi De, and I chose Heart ni Kiraboshi Sakashitare.  Baaad choice. Rei did great.  I on the other hand...  Well, let's just say it's good I warned the audience.  Keane: (As song begins - Serious Voice)  Warning...  During this song please, cover your ears. Keane:  (a bit later from Kyle's idea in an asian accent)  I have noo pwofessional twaining. Keane:  (a bit later after the dance - YES DANCE)  You might want to cover your eyes too.  After my song, Von got sick in the middle of singing her song... And she got sick baaad...  Poor Shoy-chan.  I'm not mad at you anymore btw. Also, Rei sat on my lap...  When I forgot there was a little packet of coffee cream in there.  :\  Ewww....  We were both wet baaaad.   Curse of the Fanboys  - Great panel.  A line of men read a fanfic to us (written in play format with a narrator to explain the actions) in such a hillarious fashion, even the self-insert-hater Von was laughing.  It was also a choose your own adventure type of story, so at times the audience had a chance to pick the next event in the story.  Guy 1:  Bukakke?  What's that? Narrator:  Should he learn what Bukakke is, or should we just leave it alone? Audience:  (well.. let's just say nobody said Choice B) Guy 1:  What's Bukakke?  Really, what is it? Narrator:   Well, it's easier to show you than just tell... (stands up infront of Guy 1) Guy 1:  (Screams in terror as silly string starts shooting from the Narrator's crotch to his face).    Voice Acting Contest  - Les Major had a little miniature audition for a new children's cartoon due out in a few years.  He chose random people from the audience to do parts of the script to see how it worked out.  Not so much random, but people who put their hands up.  :)  Les:  For the part of the village leader... (Keane's hand is waving almost frantically in the uber-front row) Let's choose you. (Pointing to an older asian guy.) Les:  For the part of the kid... OK you.  Only because you were first.  (pointing to a middle aged white man) Keane:  OH!  If THAT's the game! Les:  (Looks at Keane)  Yunno what, okay, get up here. Keane:  O.O  Really?  And that's how I became a Voice Actor.  I still gotta contact him to see if I did well...  He said he'd email us.  :)   Q with Atsuko Enomoto  - Definately fun.  Enomoto-sensei danced gave us an unexpected concert in the first half.  I have pictures.  :)  That was very fun.  The second half we were given the promised Q  Although I was first in line, I gave the position up to somebody asking why Enomoto-sensei became a voice actress.  urlLink  My Question for Enomoto    =D  That was great.  =_= Now I sleep. -ArV
