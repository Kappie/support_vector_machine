It mentions that they will not wear something because it's cool, and basicly that they want to be themselves. I find this very strange because Wal-Mart is the worlds largest retailer, and sells basicly the same products across the country. They are no different than The Gap, one they release a new shirt or jacket, actually, they just release their own styles, Everybody is wearing it the next day. How many people wear stuff from Wal-Mart? Well how about this? Right now I am wearing an Old Navy shirt, and Wal-Mart pants. How typical? Do I try to be myself? Hell no...I'm more different than I would like to be. Do I believe everyone should be the same? Not really. Will I continue to shop at Wal-Mart? Yes. Do I think by wearing Wal-Mart makes me unique? No, quite the oposite. I don't really say a lot of stuff like this...but I do enjoy sometimes speaking my opinion. In fact, I even optionally added the Blogger top bar at the time...At least until I get a bit more traffic coming in here. In fact, Google practicly owns this site. I use Blogger to post, I have Google Ads on this site, Google Search Engine embedded on this page, I get paid by Google (not a lot may I add), I get my mail from Google (gmail)...Could I get away from it? Yes. But google would still come crawling in to *crawl* my website.
