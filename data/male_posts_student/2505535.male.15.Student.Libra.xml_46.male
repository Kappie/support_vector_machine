But it was a good day of video gaming, and it's safe to say he got surved. Heh. He kicks ass at FPS though, and we all bought chips and onion rings, much fun was had by all.  Today me and Dave went round to Alice's for video gaming and poor quality gore/horror films like "Urban Legend" and "Valentine" which were most funny. Still lots of confusion about Me, Alice and Lou, well we're not confused, just stuck in a dilema. I won't go into that, 'cos I might say something I'm not supposed to and cock it all up.  One more day of the 3 day weekend and it's already started, I need some sleep now, cos the internet is boring me and I need to do some english coursework.
