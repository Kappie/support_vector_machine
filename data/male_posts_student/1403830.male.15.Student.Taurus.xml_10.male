Does she realize how much more I care about talking to her than she does   to me?    I could've stopped right there    No wait    I probably couldn't have    She's like crack    Addictive    I couldn't  sit there and be like    "Jesus sam snap out of it get over it"    Boyz 2 men was not going to write a song about this one    Well maybe    But only if it was one of those sexy, put this on before you rip off my   clothes type songs    And I highly doubted it would be.    Never see her    Never talk to her.    Well sometimes    Hell this image of perfection that I associate with her    Could be    Probably is    Just a figment of my imagination    I hear sirens outside of my window    A funny thing    Considering outside of my window is the most comfortable place to be in   my house.    God I hate this feeling    Because you never know what's going on and then you realize that its   just you, and you suck.    So I'm out.
