I am now a House Father in Redoran, I'm at level 24 or 25, and I'm waiting for them to finish my stronghold and for me to get my long blade up to level 80.  No one is strong enough to train me anymore.  ...  Maybe I should quit working so hard at house politics and actually do the main quest... nah.  Oh, I finally figured out how to get my computer to let me take screenshots of Morrowind. ^^
