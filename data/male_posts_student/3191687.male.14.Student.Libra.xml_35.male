Today I have an allergy shot, joy.  Will have to leave here around 4:00-ish.  Although, I will get to go to Borders :D    I have half the info for the troop's website and I like how this is going to turn out.  Still haven't entered it yet, but that's because I'm lazy.  I also haven't had lunch yet, so I'll have to cut this post short because I'm very, very hungry.
