(not in order)     THE WHITE STRIPES!! ::  (::insert loud cheering here::) um...well everything, there are only about 2 or 3 white stripes songs i dont love, but i still like all of it. But if I had to choose a favorite it would be the self titled cd. NIRVANA!!: they have this three disk CD thingy, titled Nirvana (hm..how orginial), thats the best one. Franz Ferinand: one of the CD's in my stereo now, is there one and only CD, self titled Phantom Planet: yes Carson, I do like some emo, both of Their CD's are awesome but the second one is my favorite Jimi Hendrix: Are you expierienced (or the greatest hits, but thats kinda cheating) Led Zepplin: IV and III Crystal Method: greatest techno band ever, um..it's the CD with the crab on it, damn, don't remember the name     Ramones: again I'm gonna cheat and say Greatest hits Red Hot Chili Peppers: By the Way Vines: Winning Day's Weezer: Pinkerton (yes more emo, but only pinkerton) VON BONDIES!!: amazing band, you have to buy Pawn Shoppe Heart Hives: Veni Vedi Vicuois (expect spelled right) Less than Jake: fine I give up, Hello Rockveiw and Anthem are good, but Pezcore still sucks!! Muse: have no idea what the album is... AC/DC: Back in Black, you HAVE to buy this Modest Mouse: damn the radio for over playing this song, this was MY song, i predicted it would get big and now everyone sings it :: sob:: Black Sabbath: We Sold our Souls for Rock and Roll, best quote ever..." I was into sex, drugs and rock and roll, was paying for the sex and the drugs"- Ozzy Bush: Sixteeth Stone, everything zen is a awesome song... Metallica: Saint Anger Green Day: (I'm cheating again) Greatest Hit's Yeah, that's a pretty good list but I'm sure I left someone out...
