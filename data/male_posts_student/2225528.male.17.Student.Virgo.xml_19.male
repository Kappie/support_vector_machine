Homework's been like hell.. two separate subjects for Math (imagine that!), Graph for PA and Physics, Chemistry tuition homeworks.. adding on more for the whole week.. it's a miracle I'm still breathing..   Considering hard on whether to take the interview on the second batch Prefect.. hmm.. It's a Freedom thingy kinda dilemma.. something like either choosing to live in a democratic human life or the animalistic dog-colar life thingy.. get what I mean? For prefects, no offense.. really, u're doing a great job! *cough cough*.. :Ã¾   The competition last saturday was an utter disaster.. wait, hold on.. it wasn't.. because, NOTHING HAPPENED!! The headmaster fled to Manila on the last minute and the competition cannot be continued without the "majesty" 's presence.. leaving a whole burden on our Radio Club as we had ordered a huge amount of lunch food with a debt of RM1000+.. Thanks to the school.. hmmph.. I think they should've resolved the problem by now, hopefully.. Anyway.. for those involved.. the competition will be postponed till further notice..   Sigh.. 30 minutes spent on typing this post and 7 hours, 10 minutes, 16secs left till 12am for me to finish my studies and homework..   Lord give me strength..
