On the other side of sleep at least. Little nervous becose I need to do well to get into uni but I know I won't have done as well as I need to. I'm just wondering how much I have to re-sit. I went to Newcastle yesterday and met up with my friend Jacs (AKA my magical fetch twin), I havnt seen her for a while so it was real good to see her again. Got myself a ticket to see The Rasmus (also asked Nicki, Jayne nd Danielle to come) but Jayne is on holiday so hasnt replied yet, Nicki is seein if she can get the money, Danielle is askin her folks, also Kelly was gonna go with Chris nd some other ppl but asked if she could come with me instead when she found out I was goin, cos I rule! lol. I hope Nicki nd Jayne come, its been a while since I've been out with them, also we could go to Trillians after the gig nd get pissed, which will be fun :).  Also yesterday when I got home there was an email waiting for me from Abi, she seems to be having a good time dispite the storms and the new site she is at has the internet so she can email me from there, which is good. I sent her on back askin how things are goin and tellin her how things are over here. Also asked if she has found loads of goodies for her 'Folder of Shadows' (kinda like a Book of Shadows sept its in a folder). Was raining a lot today, and we had thunder & lighting too, then there was a power cut, right when I was watching The Simpsons.  I talked to Rachael today, havn't spoke to her for ages, it was nice to catch up with things. Also read my friend Toms blog and there was one line that cought my attention 'ah Avril, was there ever a girl as minging as you?' I must say, Tom has SHIT taste!! Did I mention he also called Nicki vile? I think he should change opticians.
