I hate blogging when I have to work the next day, because I can't just let my mind wander, and instead I try to force out what I want to say.  Oh...my blog mix song choices: the Soviettes- "Paranoia Cha-Cha-Cha" Jello Biafra with D.O.A.- "That's Progress!" Wesley Willis- "Fuck You" or "They Kicked Me Out of Church" the Casualties- "Made in NYC" the Clash- "Jimmy Jazz" I think I'll go with these. You may note that unlike John, I moved away from the proven classics to go with some relatively unheard tracks. (Unheard by you guys)  If I were in the Casualties, I'd spell that "trax."  Speaking of music, the Rock Against Bush Volume Two tracklisting was released today. Not only does it have a new DKM song (!) called  We Have the Power , it has live "trax" from the Souls (Born Free), and the Mad Caddies. Also, some mainstream bands are on it, who will contribute bad songs, just as the Offspring and NFG did on Volume One. Plus, T(I)NC, Foo Fighters, Hot Water Music, Dillinger Four, and the Dwarves are also contributing new songs. Oh yeah, Op and BR are on it. No new or rare stuff from them, sadly. It comes out in August.  But where are the Casualties? I might make fun of them a lot, but "Tomorrow Belongs to Us" would be a  great  song for this comp.  Houley is officially M.I.A. If he doesn't blog by four o'clock tomorrow, me and Chris are going over to his house to check if he is still alive.   Same deal with Hobe, who I haven't really done much with this summer. Maybe it is because he works a lot, maybe it is because he seems perpetually annoyed with me.   While wandering the net tonight I found that the Department of Minnesota actually has a Department of Rhetoric.  Well, I guess it isn't as outrageous as it first seemed.  Continuing his streak of horrible choices concerning Wheel of Time, Robert Jordan has decided that book eleven of the Wheel of Time will be named  Knife of Dreams . God, I hope I don't have to explain why that is a horrible name. Now I'll grant you, it is no  Galaxies and Beyond , but  Knife of Dreams ? Come on. It sounds like the name of a scenario from a D+D game that Matt Houle wrote or something.   What is the difference between   WoT  and  Galaxies ? In one, the authors realized that the last part sucked and quit. In the other, the author decided to plod on and continue to take out everything interesting that the series once had.  Which leads me to my next brilliant idea: Transcribing  Galaxies and Beyond , a little at a time, on to this blog. Soon the whole world will be able to view the literary genius that me and Houley birthed. Well, he was like the mother, because he actually birthed it. I more of impregnated him at the beginning and made him do all the work from there on out. Not only will I add an entry a night, but I will add in my author's commentary.  Prepare to have you face melted off by mind-blowing prose and razor-sharp dialogue!  I swear to God, if anyone mocks it, I will throw a brick through their window.  Good night. I'm off to edit  G+B .
