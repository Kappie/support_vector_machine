But for me the unofficial start of summer happened just before noon today. That is when my "F" period final ended, even though it only took about and hour and five minutes to complete. Honestly, who needs the whole hour and fourty-five minutes to complete a Christian Scriptures test. Not me.   My sophomore year at St. X is over. I'm glad to announce I survived. Overall, it was a great year. Homeroom was always fun and Mr. Price was a great teacher. He always knew when to add in a joke to spice the lesson up a little. I don't know how he can still stand to use the overhead so much after all these years. I barely made it a year using it. I somehow managed to make it through Sophomore English. Greg, Ms. Burke is not as bad as you said. Yes, she does have a very loud, piercing voice. But lets be honest, she loves us Dowells. I can't even remember how many times she would say something like "there is no doubt that he is a Dowell." Sorry Greg, she said I was the best Dowell. My favorite thing to do in her class was to test to see how much favoritism she showed toward me. Every time she yelled at someone for doing something that annoyed her I would do the exact same thing. Not once did she say anything. Man, that class was so easy. I survived another year of Mr. Knoop. Too bad I have another one to go. Atleast I don't have to have another Mrs. Roberts class. Man, how dull can a class get? Mrs. Jefferson's class was a blast. It's hard to imagine a person so nice and optimistic as she was. Too bad I only had here for one semester. Then I got Mrs. Vessels for Theology. Let's just say she took theology just a little to seriously.  I didn't really know what to think of Mr. Smith before the year started but he turned out to be a good teacher. That was probably my favorite class all year. Never a dull moment. I actually had fun in that class. Also this year, I got to choose some electives. I chose two art classes which really helped develop my skills. I learned a whole lot about art and improved a lot over the year. I drew some realistic things that I never knew I was able to draw. Overall the year was really fun. I continued to make new friends and build relationships I made the year before. You really don't realize that its possible still not to know some people after two years of school.   Now, its time for the really exciting stuff to begin. The summer looks like its gonna awesome. In five short days I'll be off crossing the Atlantic. Plenty of pool parties are in the planning stages and in 1 month, 1 day I will get my permit. Not to mention that soccer is kicking in to high gear. So here's to a great summer.
