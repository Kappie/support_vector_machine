Spent most of Yesterday  today in deciding what subjects to take during my first trimester of MBA.The Subject selection has to be made online and after much research have decided to take up Financial Management,Economic Analysis,Financial Accounting,Marketing Management,e-commerce  IT (I can take upto 5 subjects and decided to take these 5 core subjects).                                I would be going back to Full-time School (or as we call it college in India) after almost 7 years.Barring the IT Certifications which I have done in the last few years, haven't done much of hard-core studies.So its going to be an exciting future.B-Schools guys , any expert inputs would be appreciated (Afterall isn't the essence of MBA giving Gyaans  fundas :-) )
