I believe it's because I'm giving control to the Holy Spirit.      Sunday night I was baptised in the Holy Ghost again. It was awesome. That's just powerful worship to me. And it's the transfer of power. I feel confident and bold in my faith more than ever. Being filled with the Spirit is the best thing that you could ask for.      Now I'm focusing on prayer, which is a main ingredient in worship. I'm learning how to be more disciplined in prayer. I have a notebook that I've been writing down things to pray for in. It's been a great tool for me, because of my short term memory. I feel like I'm really drawing closer to the heart of God as well.      Juanita Bynum has completely revolutionized my life as well. The other night I heard her preaching on the threashing floor. It's when you get down on your face before God. She also made a guarantee, that when you get on the threashing floor you will hear from God in 48 hours or less. And it's true (see post below).      Sometimes I can't even pray for praising God. And it's truly a place where I think moving worship takes place. In Revelation, numerous times did the elders fall on their faces and worship.      Anyway that's how it's been going lately. God's plan is unfolding. What's awesome is I'm in it!
