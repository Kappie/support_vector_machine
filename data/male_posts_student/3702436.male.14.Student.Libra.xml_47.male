(correct me if i'm wrong) we are not too bad. hopeful. sji's leotard's nice. (but dat's besides the pt). they are high but they dun look gd in their moves. chs is not bad. some high and highly unstable, others are too tall. others are simply quite alright. they stand a chance. so, in concluding, may the best team win.   ***************************************************************** countdown: 5 more hrs to comp
