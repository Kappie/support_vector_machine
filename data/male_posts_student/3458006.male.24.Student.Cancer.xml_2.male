Sooo..., Whats hapening today then... My bro and one of my best mates are going to visit me in Lindau. Sweet. We are gonna be sooo pissed.    Background info: I am doing some work experience in Lindau, Germany. Have been here for about 5 months and will return to the Emerald Isle soon enough for my final year of college. Failed an exam so I'll be back a little sooner than I really wanted but sure, these things happen!         I'll stick up some pics and I'm sure there will be a few tales to tell soon enough too!
