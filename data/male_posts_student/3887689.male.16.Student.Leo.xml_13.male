I can nearly feel the salty tears of future nostalgia stream down my face and enter my mouth, causing me to spit them out on my wall, which then crumbles because of the moisture. It's been an interesting (by which I mean "not interesting") summer. I am currently at my mom's house in Michigan, several hundred miles away from my home state of North Carolina. But let me assure you folks, nothing is too far away from the hellish pit that some people refer to as my home. Boy, do I hate that place. But enough of my ranting. You probably want to know some stuff about me. First of all, I'm a teenager. I'm a pretty nice guy, if I say so myself. I am, however, fairly pessimistic. I believe that the majority of the human race are morons, with my fellow teenagers being the main culprits.Seriously, theactions and attitudes of my peers disgust me. As far as hobbies go, my main one would be music. I love indie rock and IDM, but most of all, I love to play guitar. I'm a good guitarist, but sadly, I'm not very creative. But as I'm playing more, I find that more and more cool riffs are coming to me. As soon as I can scrape together a song, you guys will be the first to hear it. Well, that's enough for now. Next time I post, I'll try to make it more interesting.
