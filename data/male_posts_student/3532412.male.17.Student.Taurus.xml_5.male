"what the... all these while, i've been going to church just for some fairy tale conjured by satanic pagans?". whoa, satanic? how can these satanic ones be there... without our God? God created everything. even the one we describe as absolute evil. how twisted can these historians and scientists be... claiming that God is just something a pagan wrote about and that creation is simply a pure matter of strings of coincidence that brings about the monkeys which eventually leads to humans (note that pagans can not exist without God since they are anti-God, just like satan vs God).        listen, there is no evolution. creation is what created us and no matter what the textbooks would say, note that they mention the whole 'evolution' thing as 'The Darwin Theory". a theory is something that has yet to be confirmed as of whether it is true or not. ha! got you there, didn't they. so really, you didn't evolve from monkeys (even if you did wish someone you know actually evolved from something less than human). but no, that's not really the main thing. let's get back to "is God something that's real?". are you asking me? i'm saying yes. ok, let's see the theories they made up, 'God is just something they wrote about', 'God is just something the pagans write about', 'God is just a fairy tale'. let's take the main thing from these 3 arguements, which says God is just something written long ago and grew along to be something that we all come to believe in more and more each time. blasphemy at it's most possible existence.      the bible explains a lot of things, after all it is the word of God. However most of the time, we fail to actually get the messages of how true He is. a lot of questions, the bible has already addressed and a lot more, the bible has already answered.  it answers the simplest questions like, 'why am i so unlucky? why can't i have what he/she has?" to a lot more questions, we, humans face daily. these questions, science can not answer. go ask a scientist of why you're so down on luck. he can no longer turn to his lab book. how has the bible or those who carries the word of God answered that? well, the  father (father being the one who leads the sunday mass) at this church i used to visit when i was a 7 years old answered me, "if God has yet to give it to you, wait patiently. He works in His own time". so the unbelievers turn back at you, 'what kind of answer is that?'. tell them to ask themselves, how often has their own father told them that magic phrase, "no son, it's not time for that yet, you're much too young for that'. of course, the bitterness of not getting what we want usually drowns the ability to understand that there might actually be someone who knows what's best for us better than we, ourselves, know. then sometimes, they lash back, 'what kind of explanation is that, saying He only works in His own time?'. look, let's say you have a pet dog, the dog keeps begging you for the snack treats you keep giving him. out of fear of the poor mutt's teeth rotting out from the measly snacks, you refuse it the right to more, thinking it's best to give him more of those when the time is right, say tomorrow or later at night? isn't that very applicable to your unlucky situation? of course, that's saying if you're the dog. just pretend you are... it's just a given situation.          you know, sometimes it's this kind of simple questions that most matters in life. it represents what makes us human, the ability to question of what is happening to us. for a person to write a book, via different authors who agree on the same answer, authors from a huge timespan who can not turn to each other due to the gap of time, is almost impossible. so it's possible? yes, if it is God who does it. listen, let's say part of their theory is true, someone out there wrote something about all the things that is important for life, what is good and what to avoid, no matter what times you are in. if somebody actually had the ability to read all the way through time and space into any given situation to answer the questions, is it possible? yes. only one person could do that and that person is God.           so this may not answer whatever doubts people have regarding God... but i tried my best, it's hard to write about all the little things into an essay to explain something that is God... i'm not a pastor... not a religious expert... and not a psychologist, just a teenager with a lot of free time.
