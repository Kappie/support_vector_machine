The song is from Loren's stuffs (and used to be his Xanga song) because I'm still waiting on Ian giving me a username for his server, and this is actually a decent chino song.  Here's a review of my vacation so far:   Friday  Doctor's appointment, report card, good conversations   Saturday  Slept through MT, saw "Kill Bill: Volume 2" with Dan Waldinger and Arnaud, hung out with Dan and Arnaud in Newtonville, went to Matt KK's house and watched "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" on his huge-screen TV with him and Jonny   Sunday  MT, good conversations   Monday  Saw the first male runners of the marathon, went to Rockport with Ian, Arnaud, Dmitri, and my father   Tuesday  Hiked up the Great Blue Hill with my father and brother, beating them severely (figuratively speaking), had my first frappe in a while, acted as judge giving realistic decisions at MT   Wednesday  Went with my father to Clark  White to pick up his new car (he leases), ate at Cabot's, had fun with Loren and Melody who spontaneously showed up at my house, presented new tire-plug theory at MT   Thursday  (Today) Ate lunch with Jonny, John, and Arnaud at Newtonville Pizza, went with my father to Walden Pond to walk around   I hope everyone else is having as good a time.  I went to CVS with Loren yesterday after Melody left, and I was buying these things, and also I gave them the application thing for the "ExtraCare" card which is apparently so they can like keep tabs on you (but as I said to my father and brother on GBH, "I don't mind if I get spied on if I get like a dollar off or something,") and then I only brought eight dollars but my things cost like eleven, and Loren didn't have any extra money, so I was going to use my debit card, but then forgot my PIN (now I remember), and then so I was like "Can I like unget something?" and then the girl had to ring everything up again, and meanwhile behind me this long line was forming and there was this mother with little kids and I heard her like "I don't know what the hold-up is!"  That was embarrassing but funny.  GBH is like a thousand feet, and I climbed it in like five minutes, so Kilimanjaro really must not be that bad.  And apparently most of it is like a gradual going up, with just a little steep part at the end, plus we'll have porters, so I truly don't know for what I was supposed to have been getting in shape.  Rockport, always fun.  The Loren-Melody thing was actually like a compromise that was made after I was seeming to try to curve a situation in a certain way, even though I wasn't really, and apparently Loren wanted it to turn out a different way.  Either way, though, it ended up being really fun.   Juliet: "You yourself are hard of hearing, aren't you?" Luba: "And then she should be like, 'What?'"
