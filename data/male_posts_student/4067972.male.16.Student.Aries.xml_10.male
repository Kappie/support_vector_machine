I don't think i have any teachers that have a bad reputation.  I wanted to go to the pool today, but i didn't.  I need to go sometime.  We pay 270 dollars a year for the pool and i've only been twice, so my mom's not too happy.  I need to go a lot next week.  School starts in 8 days...bleh.  I'm kinda lookin forward to it, but not really.
