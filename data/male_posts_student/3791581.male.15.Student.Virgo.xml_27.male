The house next door was demolished this morning, which means that I have been up at the crack of dawn for the past few days and will continue to be for the next two months. So much for studying at home and getting a decent night's rest.   I've somewhat resigned to a state of complacency, a sort of withdrawal or resolute dissatisfaction since knowing that the boards are drawing near.  This is unlike any other exam I have prepared for; fairness and equality among applicants seems like a misguided storybook ordeal.  In addition to the inexperienced employees at my school, the governing association of BC and the ambiguous evaluation standards which differ from doctor to doctor, I feel at a complete loss.  This sense of hopelessness is not uncommon among my classmates and other applicants.   If I've confused anybody, here's how it works: there are two parts to my exam - a written and a practical.  The written exam is made up of 30 or so case studies to which we must answer within 4 hours. A large percentage of that is made up of "survey questions", which means that the licensing board is still "tweaking" their testing style. The practical portion consists of point location on human models, and the presiding doctor will determine if the points are correct. This is also a problem, because everyone knows that this varies from acupuncturist to acupuncturist, based on their education and personal experience. Now, even if you attain a high mark, they can only grant a certain number of licenses per year.  So, no matter how much I study or practice (and I have been only studying and practicing for the last long while), I don't know what it comes down to.  There is an unusually large volume of applicants this time around since the exams are offered only once a year now. I don't believe in "getting to know" the examiners or those on the granting committee, and I don't believe in "dressing to impress".   I should have applied for the US certification exam initially. It's a little easier since anatomical charts are provided for point location instead of human models.  Well, I will take my chances and keep my head up. Here goes nothing!
