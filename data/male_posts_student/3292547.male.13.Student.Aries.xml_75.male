It takes off where the Burnville Demo left off. I'm thinking that if I like this, I'm going to buy the full version. It's time to spend some of my $$$ I've been saving.  The Call of Duty Burnville Demo can be downloaded  urlLink here . And the Dawnville Demo  urlLink here .  The Call of Duty Official Webpage can bee found at  urlLink http://www.callofduty.com
