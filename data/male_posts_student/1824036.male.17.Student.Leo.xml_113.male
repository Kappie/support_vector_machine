Quite comical what the genius can find on the internet....Chad seriously is a freak show....  Nothing much to talk about. I am borrowing Brian Gorman's (my sister's boyfriend) electric guitar now. My band, well...not  MY BAND  but the band that I am in, is comprised of Jake Short, Tom Hanrahan, Dan Blair, and I. I dont know if we will be any good, but we are all pretty good players by ourselves :) so you never know....  No name yet for the band by the way....  Nice bloggin fer ya....adios!
