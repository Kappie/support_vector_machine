And to make it easier, I'll exclude all the charity work of the Gates Foundation when making this determination.  Obviously, because I'm asking when the answer appears so obvious to most, you can correctly assume I'm all for Gates over the good Mother.  I think we've discussed this before, but I'd like to go over it with Danny, to get to those core values.
