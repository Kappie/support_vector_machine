You too show love in many ways... It's just the "many times" bit which is subjectively based on your character and how introvert or bitter you are.  Yes boys and girls, Simon Cowell shows love too. Through all the tactless advice, is sometimes criticism. If contestants throw away the nasty adjectives, they'll find real stuff to work with in there.  OK. Mr Wee Tat Chuen got married today. I was there at the wedding and I think I needed it. A dose of something little to tell me that romance is not dead. I felt sorry for him though, coz most of the guests were real fools. Babies were crying and their parent's didn't have the sense to leave the ballroom with them, handphones went off when we were told to put them to silent. I mean, even if we were not, it's common sense isn't it? And don't give me that shit about forgetting! It's a wedding! "NO FORGETTING" is a sign that ought to be placed on the door. Also, there was a terrible amount of mumbling going on. I wish people, especially those older than me would respect the ceremony and SHUT UP. You have over 500 people in the ballroom, and say 200 are murmuring. THAT'S A HELL LOT OF MURMURING!  Ah well, I was happy for them and I took n the ceremony like a breath of fresh air. I saw many old friends but it was weird coz it was just different. I was among strangers. And I know it's petty, but I just felt like another guest. It wouldn't have made a difference if I hadn't gone. After the "high tea" a group of us (the others) went to ZARA, ESPRIT, BORDERS and STARBUCKS. We had a good time. Will place insightful notion later.  Then went to Leon (Toh)'s place for a BBQ dinner. Anand came over. Was somewhat glad to see him. He reads this page and told me that the writing inspires him. Thank you boss! He's a nice guy just doing his job. We're similar in some ways. Anyway, for the time he and his friends were there, the group was consumed in UWC chatter. I kinda wish they'd have been more considerate, but I guess it's the only thing that binds them together, so it's ok. Jolyn and I took the opportunity to steal away to a corner and talk. I like Jolyn. She's real.  When the rest had left, Leon, Deb, Jolyn, Shyama and I talked till 1215 about things. Life, people, choices, rugby and we were ourselves. I am happy even when I think about it. We were just sitting and talking in his garden. Very very nice. I love my UWC mates. It was plain and simple and we could communicate our ideas without inhibition. We don't just talk facts and figures, we talk feelings too! I LOVE IT!!! It's upsetting that I couldn't get chosen. My life would be MUCH better. Would do almost anything for a chance. Oh well. Like I said, I've made many bad decisions this year. I have to set the boating trip up soon. Have to give special mention to Deb. The 10 A1, athlete who's a real beauty with a great smile and bright sparking eyes.  Leon and I sat at the bus stop for about 20 minutes talking even though we knew the bus wasn't going to come. I love him. We spoke of our kind and religion and he offered to force me to study. I gladly took him up on that. I sound self righteous? Bite me!  God didn't choose to give me the scholarship but he gave me friends which I could keep for life. I want to keep these people. We are different. Some of us are shunned in certain social circles coz we're misunderstood. We are united in that in some sense. We are different. We have practical intelligence rather than system intelligence. Not that we're duphuses when it comes to homework. It's just that we think all the time. We like to think. It's habitual. Sure we walk about with songs playing in our heads too, but simultaneously, not many people there can comprehend the mass of thought which helps us in a way, appreciate our WORLD better. I am looking forward to facilitating interaction between the Tamils and Sinhalese in the conference.  I have tested myself today. I worked fine and enjoyed myself as well as thoroughly entertained my Fairfield friends as well as my UWC friends. So the problem with the AC classmates is not my fault. It's theirs'. Great! Tim's coming back boys and girls. Hold on to your hats. It'll take a bit of time, but as my favourite cyborg used to say, "I'll be back"
