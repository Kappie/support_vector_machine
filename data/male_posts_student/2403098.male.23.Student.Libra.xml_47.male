THREE DATES in TWO weeks.  that's all I gotta say.  It's dreeaaaaaaaary today, and I'm enjoying it.  I'd love to just crawl back into my bed and take a niceeeee long nap.  I don't think I will though, because I've got things to do.  ARG  I just got up from my comfy spot on the love seat in order to take out some laundry that beeped at me, and my dog stole my spot.  I don't have the heart to move him so now I'm sitting on the floor.  My apartment is so obsessively clean right now that I'm just thrilled.  I spaz, from time to time, and clean the hell out of this place.  So much so that it's spotless now.  I just keep looking around thinking "why don't I keep it like this all the time, it actually looks GOOD."    That commercial is on for Zoloft right now.  You know the one where the lil' white blob gets sad and it starts raining on his little blob-self.  Then, all of a sudden a butterfly, or some shit, comes and coaxes the blob into following him to meet up with other blobs who do not suffer from blob-depression.  My dog barked when the commercial came on, I'm thinking he's trying to tell me something.  Either he doesn't like blobs or he is suffering from blob-depression and wants some Zoloft.  He's gone back to sleep now (the dog) which is actually a SIGN of depression, maybe I should worry.    Can I have a career yet?  Okay, just checking, yeah I'll finish my undergrad degree first.  Anyhow, take care.
