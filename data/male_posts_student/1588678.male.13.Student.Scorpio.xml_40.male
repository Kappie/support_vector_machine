It was my first time seeing the extended edition and to make things cooler I saw it in theaters at the Imax in Dublin. That’s probably one of my favorite theaters that I’ve been to. Any-hoo, it was awesome, awesome, and guess what . . . AWESOME!!!  The Extras - Excellonty! It’s seeing a extra 15 minutes of a 3 hour movie that puts the mojo in a movie. Some of the extras were kinda not important, but there were some extras that helped you understand some stuff better. After seeing to movie it makes me wanna see all of them straight, y’know? My brother says that the extras in The Two Towers is even better. It’s cool because that same theater is gonna play the extended edition of The Two Towers this week. We might go. I especially wanna see the extended Two Towers before I see The Return of the King just incase if I don’t see the extended Two Towers I’m not gonna be a total doosh-bag and not understand Return of the King.   Grade - Duhhh. The Lord of the Rings - Extended edition - Battles with ugly-ass monsters. Okay, a simple as humanly possible, I give it an ass-kicking *****! Gee, that was easy.
