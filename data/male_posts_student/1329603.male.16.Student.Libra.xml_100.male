It pisses me off to do it but I can't be a completely selfish wanker 100% of the time, and I can't make things more difficult by doing the other option, so I'll bide my time, I guess. Phuff. It's just... we go together like ramma lamma lamma ka dinga da dinga dong (thankyou Scott for the idea).   Today I have felt ill. Today I have felt miserable. Today I have felt guilty. But, today I have been to Bristol and heard some of the greatest poets of our time reading their poems. W00t. The poet I most respect who was there: Gillian Clarke. The best performer: John Cooper-Clarke. Carol Ann Duffy: Must write better poetry. C+.  I'm not going to be a git and say why I've been down today. I just have. So NYAAAAAAH.  Learnt a bit more Swedish pronunciation though.  Quote of the day: "We go together like ramma lamma lamma ka dinga da dinga dong, Remembered forever as shoo-bop sha whadda whadda yippidy boom da boom. Chang chang changity chang shoo-bop that's the way it should be, Whoa, yeah!"  From   We Go Together   From the (s)Hit Musical   Grease   Love, Jon Roskilly
