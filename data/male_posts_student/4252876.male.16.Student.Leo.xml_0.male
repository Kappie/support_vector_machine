She happens to be allergic to wheat, so she used a rice wafer, and they called her on it. What the hell is wrong with these people? I thought Catholicism was supposed to be about love and charity and burning the occasional heretic. So now they send it all the way up to the Vatican level to decide. Sounds like bureaucracy to me. I have issues with the Catholics to begin with, but this stuff is just absurd. They're holding out communion like a goddamn carrot on a stick.  -"But I want it!" -"Can't have it." -"But I want it!" -"And you're in AA and you still have to drink the wine." -"But...what the hell?" -"And, you voted for a candidate who supports gay marriage. HA! DENIED!" -etc  So, the overall picture we're gettin here is of a backwards, intolerant, (perverted, no less) bunch of old men who are twisting the idea of faith into knots for whatever reasons they want, And a billion people put up with this shit! If somebody hadn't got up and said somethin about it, they'd still be excommunicatin people right and left and burnin them at the stake. Now, I don't have a problem with the Catholics themselves, for the most part, any more than I have a problem with, say, Muslims or Jews. (Believe me, certain segments of all of the above are definitely getting on my nerves lately). But the leadership sucks. Ok, so that's the theological rant. Sometimes I think someone should resurrect Manicheanism, it makes about as much sense as any modern religion. As the good  urlLink Edward Abbey  said, "Orthodoxy is a relaxation of the mind accompanied by a stiffening of the heart."  In other news,  urlLink Bill Maher is playing the role of Satan.  Go Bill!  I assume there are few people out there who believe that this is true calling anyway.
