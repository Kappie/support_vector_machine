I know I am fairly intelligent (at least not stupid); I know I am somewhat cute (at least not completely unfortunate looking); I know I am a nice (nice to the point of being walked all over sometimes).  However, I don't feel like I really deserved to be loved sometimes.  I am insecure in that I worry about whoever I am dating leaving me.  The main reason I have come to feel this way is from past experience.  When you have 2 people who claim to love you simply dissapear from your life without so much as a good-bye. when you have person after person be not interested in dating you, when you have boyfriends break up with you for no good reason you beging to wonder what is wrong with you.  Even with David I feel some insecurity.  I know he loves me; I know he wants to be with me; I know he wants to spend his life with me (his words not mine).  I can see the truth of it in his eyes, his actions, his touch.  Yet I can not stop the stupid worry that he will change.  Well .... I know he will change as a person.  Anyone who has lived thru ages 20-25 will say that they changed during those years ... some a LOT (like me) and some maybe just a little, but ALL changed some.  Will David's feeling for me change ... will what he wants in life change ... I don't have the answer to these questions ... he doesn't either ... only God Himslef knows for sure what will happen in the future.  David gets upset at me when I say "I hope" when talking about us.  Like I will say "I hope it works out" and David will say something like "You HOPE?!?"  as if it's an insult that I would say hope instead of I know.  I can't say I know tho becuase I don't ... he doesn't ... we don't ... none of us ... WE DON'T KNOW THE FUTURE ...
