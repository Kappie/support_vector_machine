Are you familiar with a little country called Somalia? Sure you are. Last nite, over 10,000 Somalians died. Did you join greenpeace? Did you sign up for the Red Cross to go provide crisis support? No. 7,000 AMERICANS die in 9/11, and we scour the world in an unending crusade to eliminate terrorism. The amount of innocent people alone that have been killed is in the 10,000's range. Oh, and lets not forget the terrorists. But their casualties don't count. 7,000 Americans die, and the world falls to it's knees. Because we are born with all the power, our deaths are somehow more important? Fuck.   If I asked you to die for me, would you? I doubt it. If you asked me to, would I? I doubt it.   I'm the cynic. I'm angry all of the time because the world did not bow down to my influence. What I do not realize, however, is that I will have to do more than ask the world very rudely before it will do anything for me. Nevertheless, I refuse to see it as my fault, and direct all of the anger towards some unseen force in the universe that is magically acting against me.
