It started Thursday night at around 9pm when i finished my calc 2 take home quiz. me, big smut, and jeff took some shots of peach schnapps and whiskey. then headed up to club 21 where the game of the night was flip cup. played two or three hours of flip cup.. i wanted to stop because i was getting too drunk but i was "forced" to play. I somehow made it to my 1220pm class the next day..  Friday i had 4 coronas on an empty stomach. i played holdem against james.. he had the same hands a few times it was fun.. won 2 games... and then lost 2 games.. drunk some more.. had a lot of fun..   Last night was a chill night.. i didn't drink because i had no more alcohol.. i played a lot of Mario 3 in the girls' room... there was a huge game of flip cup.. played a couple rounds..  a lot more shit went down..  that's a totally censored version of my weekend .. if you want to know the dirty details then IM me.. but i have to calm down with the offending posts.. i got called an asshole for my post of life  : (   Congratulations ANDREW on getting accepted to Albany.. you have to graduate high school first to get here.. so do what you gotta do and stop fucking around!!  Have a smutty one!  - R w L super SMUT
