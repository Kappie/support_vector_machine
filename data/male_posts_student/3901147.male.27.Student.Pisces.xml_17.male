I have come to the realization that having no friends gives me a unique perspective on things.  Sure I have friends that are family but those are different.  I don't have anyone that I confide in other than my best friend that is my wife.  You know, play video games with *that I gave up* talk about what's going on with your woman.  Someone to shoot the breeze with and talk about mowing the yard.  Not having anyone to talk to gives me the unique ability to listen to others.  I have this strange knack for dragging the mundane craziness out of almost any stranger without even asking.  I go to get my hair cut, and the guy just goes on and on about his girlfriend of three years and how they just put her on birth control and of course it caused her to have a breakdown.  He proceeds to tell me all the details of it and I am thinking, "Omigosh I am trapped in this chair and this guy has scissors!"  I have so many examples I may use this site to someone drudge up a few of the more memorable ones I have had the pleasure to experience over the years.  Anyways I'm going to work on some laundry before this wiff comes home and take something for this rockin headache.  Rob
