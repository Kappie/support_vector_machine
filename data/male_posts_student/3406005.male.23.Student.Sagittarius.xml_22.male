Harper's response to Sgro is priceless:    When Ms. Sgro attempted to confront Mr. Harper over Conservative MP Rob Merrifield's comment that women considering an abortion should be required to be counselled by a third party, Mr. Harper brushed past her and scoffed: "You better go door knocking Judy, you're going down in your riding."   Don MacDonald also has a mocking article on the whole affair here. I found this bit quite amusing:    Veterans Affairs Minister John McCallum equally made a fool of himself with his own intervention at a later stop in Markham. Caught up in mostly a friendly crowd of Conservatives displaying their support for Mr. Harper, the Liberal minister pushed his way to the Conservative leader.    If we've learned one thing in the past couple of days, its: don't make an ass of yourself while caught in a "friendly crowd of Conservatives":   urlLink    take that, young man! urlLink     Hehe, check out the hearing aid....
