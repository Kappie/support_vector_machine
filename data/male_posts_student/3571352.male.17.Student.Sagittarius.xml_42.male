My computer power supply dies. 2. People are assholes while driving. 3. eBay + Microsoft = Don't Mix 4. Lock down your access point(s)!  That's just the summary.  1. I was wondering what this burning smell was that was in my room.  I though nothing of it and I noticed that my system and  CPU temps were over 110F.  So I finally decided after two weeks to take it apart and test it.  Well now it makes an unusual buzzing noise and gets VERY hot.  Mind you this is the third power supply for this PC.  So I had to run out to Best Buy and order a new one for $70.  Then I really could not have waited to get this fixed so yeah.  I check eBay and they have the same power supply for about $40 shipped.  I was mad but oh well.  2. Some woman in Colonia, NJ decides it is okay to stop in the MIDDLE of the road to talk to her "friends" by their house.  Lady... pull the fuck over!! We exchanged a few words and left it at that.  I had some other sinister plans like blast some hard-core RAP or death-metal rock while laying on the horn till she moved, but I did not think of this until I was 1/2 way home.  This was coming back from Best Buy mind you.  3. Well eBay closed down my auction for Office 97 Professional FULLY SEALED NEVER OPENED!  There was nothing wrong with it!  It was not OEM or NOT FOR RESALE.  So I don't know what the problem is with them.  Well anyway I am never gonna list ANYTHING Microsoft on eBay again.  4. Well someone for two weeks was sitting on my Wireless Network.  I just found this out two days ago.  I'm not sure what he was doing there but he cracked my WEP code.  I was not too happy about this so I changed my name, changed the channel, changed the WEP key, and disabled SSID broadcast.  I will discuss more on wireless security later on when I get some more time.  .Signing off.
