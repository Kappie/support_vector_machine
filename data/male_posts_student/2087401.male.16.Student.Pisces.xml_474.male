No I didn't go back and in a fit of OCD alphabetize those names. Stop looking at me like that. Rachel's not coming, 'cause she'll be in Iowa, which is sad. Can you get the tickets to Thomas or I (we're the closest, so that would make the most sense) before Sunday? I can pay you afterwards if you front the cash for me. Also is there a youth group that day and if so, why don't we all just go together from the show? It'd make sense. I'm all about sense and the making of it today.  Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips..
