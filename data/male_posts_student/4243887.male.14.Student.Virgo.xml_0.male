I'm trying to find some good skatespots anywhere near here so I can make a sponsor tape.... Hopefully I can get sponsored by somone halfway decent (There is a local team called Sane that I wouldn't mind joining) anyway... maybe I can find a nice 9 stair to 360 flip over if I can get my landings good! ;) Talk to you kids lata!
