It is absolutely Hilarious. apparently Entertainment Weekly publishes a list of the 100 most powerful people, and this is the story of some of them. What they say about Vin Diesel is so true. on a side not i think Vin Diesel looks like a puppy, does anyone concur? And yeah id o realise Fame Tracker is one of my links on the side bar but y'know.  Right now I'm listening to  2,000 Watts  from the album "Invincible" by Michael Jackson for more info on them click  urlLink here . I'd give this song about 4 stars out of 5.   I'm also thinking about implimenting a Word of the day, comments?
