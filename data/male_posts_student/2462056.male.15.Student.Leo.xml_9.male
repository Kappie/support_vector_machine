Driver's ed is finally over... well.. not really finally, since it only last a week... but it was still boring as crap... and having to get up at 7 in the morning during summer break? What is up with that?  Now all I have to do is wait 2 weeks to do driving practice and a road test, then I'll have to wait for my 16th birthday, which is August 13th.  Last night I went to Andy's house, along with Claire, Trent, Emma, Cathy, and Megan.  We watched the MTV movie awards, then everyone left except me, Claire, and Trent, so Andy busted out some DDR, haha.  Yep, so then I got home around 11:00 or 11:15ish, got on AIM for a while, drank some lemonade, then went to bed like, crazy early, it was like, midnight:30.  That was the most sleep I've gotten since Saturday, which is crazy.  I had a bass lesson today after driver's ed, which was cool.  Then I came home and ate some ramen noodles, then laid down for a while, which felt good. Yep, that's it.
