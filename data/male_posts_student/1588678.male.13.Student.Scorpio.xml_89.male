I guess if you saw the doc that they did of Dogtown and Z-Boyz, than it's just like this, except there's actual actors in it! So it sounds good.  One thing about the preview that got me was it didn't seem like "acting" type of a movie; it looked more of a doc of a dude who made skateboards back in the day/a craftsman show. Well, I've only seen the preview once, so maybe it's more, y'know, than I thought!  I'll see ya'll there when it's out!   In memory of my big-dawg  Ronald Reagan (1911-2004) .
