Today, from tee to green I had five fairways, only one green in regulation, thirteen putts (no three putts) for a total of four pars and five bogies. To be exact, I actually had twelve putts (I was on the fringe on ten), but that was just a normal putt like any other. I again played the last three holes one over, only bogeying 17. I actually hit the fairway on 16! And the green! And I two putted for par! The stars must be aligned! My five one putts went towards three par saves and two bogey saves.I actually hit it into the forest preserve on 14 on my approach, but I dropped and got up and down to save bogey. I wish I could shoot 41 on the back every time. I can see where some par opportunities could be found if playing the last three holes in one over falls through. I bogeyed both par fives, and obviously they aren't too hard. Still, this just shows me that I  can  shoot a forty one on the back so long as I don't make too many doubles (yesterday was an extreme case). I really wish I was making more birdies, but by averaging only two greens per nine holes, its kinda hard to make a lot of them.
