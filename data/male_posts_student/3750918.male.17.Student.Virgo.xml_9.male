And if you just want to read, that's fine, too. Some of you are men of action, some are more the scholarly type. I'll try to post at least one item a day to keep the blog free of that not-so-fresh feeling, and I look forward to everyone else's thoughts as well.  Speaking of men of action, it appears that a kid in Cedar City has  urlLink launched his own protest , of sorts. Nice. Hey, it's a start. Good for him.  I have added a permanent link to the comic strip called "Day By Day", by a conservative guy, Chris Muir, who consistently nails it on the head without bashing your brains in. Maybe some of the liberal standbys like Gary Trudeau, et al, could learn something from Mr. Muir. But let's hope not.  In reference to the link to the Constitution, I must admit that until recently, I hadn't read the Constitution since High School. Pretty sad. But, you can always catch up. So I did. Good for me. I'd recommend that everybody read at least the amendments. It's really rather short, especially for a legal document.
