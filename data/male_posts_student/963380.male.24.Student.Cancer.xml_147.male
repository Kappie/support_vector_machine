Willfully abandoning your child to crib death as you parade around the deck chatting with friends and joking about the nature of pimentos and their place in the world and your martini. Apologies are being made, accusations are being hurled; it's flat our rediculous. I won't forget this.  In other news, the dream is still alive - Jay has a drive unlike no other I've ever seen - smart lad, jovial and - well, he gets distributed computing on a micro and macro scale. That's kinda cool. I'm glad I can still be a part.  Glen's been in home theatre for three weeks now - he's based for two paychecks. It's sad. That's a lie; it's amusing. I wrote "Dust me Glen" on all of the TVs in his section. I'm not a nice fellow. Full count was tonight - it was over in record time.  I've the aspriation to write the Great American Novel. It's on my to do list.  I think I need a new camcorder and an iBook. Tomorrow I'm going to open a savings account for those two items.  I'm clenching my jaw a lot. I need to talk to my dentist a lot. My teeth are quite a bit straighter now.  I'm now onto Foundation and Empire (as soon as I found my copy - I was searching for quite a bit - it was disparaging not being able to find it).  I haven't been able to use my camera or my telescope of late. That's sad. I will be able to soon, that's nice.  My new computer flies. Bloody well flies. It's uncanny.  Played some Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance II. While I'm broken hearted at the loss of my nigh unstoppable Archer-of-Death, the Rogue Dwarf ain't half bad.   I think I'm just writing for something to do right now. I'm going to go and try to be more creative.  Currently listening to: The Beatles
