I'll tell you about it since theres nothing else I could really talk about, except for the whole Annisa thing but I'll explain that later on.    Now the dream starts off in my college in Canberra. It was lunch time and I was chatting with some of my friends. Now every lunch time most of the time we play a bit of indoor soccer. For some reason I brought my soccer ball. But the thing is I was really protective of the ball, what I mean by this is that I was always constantly looking after it. Lunch is now over, and after class I saw Annisa and Christina. I walk up to them and I started talking to them. But for some reason I turned my back on them and then they disappeared. Then I spent most of the time searching for my bag and my soccer ball. Eventually, I ended up in my old high school in Canberra. I was still searching for my bag but then I found myself in some mall, trying to get away from my parents. o.O After finally getting away from my parentsI walked out side of the mall and I found myself in front of Cita Buana, but as I was about to enter the place a door with a lock was in my way. And then I woke up.    Weird dream, I had some idea of the dream but if people have suggestion please feel free to tell me. AnywaysI have school on monday. *sigh* back to school
