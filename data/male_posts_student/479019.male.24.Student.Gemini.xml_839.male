However, she's perhaps just too nice of a person. Her comments and questions are just too naive and goody goody. When we chat online, I get annoyed with how ignorant she is of so much. I really think she's someone that needs to get out more and enjoy a decadent and debauchery filled life while she's still young. Then she wouldn't be as annoying.   I think the same can be said about one of my male friends... who's sense of humor and social skills can use some work.  I feel bad for thinking these things, because they don't try to be annoying and are good people.  **
