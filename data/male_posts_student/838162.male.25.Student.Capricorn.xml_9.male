Why are you running away? 'Cause I did enough To show you that I Was willing to give and sacrifice And I was the one Who was lifting you up When you thought Your life had had enough And when I get close You turn away There's nothing that I can do or say So now I need you to Tell me the truth You know I'd do that for you So why are you running away? Why are you running away? Is it me, is it you Nothing that I can do To make you Change your mind Is it me, is it you Nothing that I can do Is it a waste of time? Is it me, is it you Nothing that I can do To make you Change your mind So why are you running away? Why are you running away? What is it I've got to say So why are you running away? To make you admit you're afraid Why are you running away?      - Running Away by Hoobastank
