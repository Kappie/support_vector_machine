I keep hearing people say "Yah, I hit the snooze button at least three times this morning!" Yah, I don't care. Whoever invented that button was a bastard. One more way to give people the easy way out.   Back in my day, I remember when I woke up by the rooster's crowing at4:30 in the mornin', and I had to trudge 3 miles uphill in the snow with only my open-toed leather moccasins on my feet to shootthat thingin the head to shut it up.   Breakfast. With a side of toast. White bread. Wheat tastes like dirt baked into bread form.  Time for work.
