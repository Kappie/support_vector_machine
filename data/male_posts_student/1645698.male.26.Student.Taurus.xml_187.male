I should be getting ready NOW but something is keeping me from doing so.  I've been gluing myself to the computer doing bullshit things...mostly looking at sony vaio notebooks ~_~ ooooo i can dream cant i? hehe...and looking at the weather site for about 15 times as IF saying to myself i AM getting a lil ready.  i'm supposed to call up addie too...but not too sure why?  i'm going to the museum to see my mentor..addie's just gonna be at the museum....was she implying to hang out?  or was she gonna join me with my mentor????  i'm so dead; i can barely open my eyes.  i wish i had magic powers.  i could orb myself around *grin* that way i wouldnt have to bother with stupid transportation and stupid male harrassers.  I really should start getting a permit...but then....what use is a car in the city unless ur going to be driving around in queens or something.  i'm really just blabbing rite now..i really dont wanna go!! but i have to.  something about a stupid contest i have to participate in and the deadline is this wed i think...i've been doing this experiment studying kids and all....i've done it maybe 3 times this whole month and the times i have gone I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M LEARNING OUT OF IT....so i'm gonna have to figure out some way to bullshit on what i studied and found out on the application.  this is the only reason i'm coming in today, so mentor can help me what to write.  it's so nice being able to type fast....cuz then u  type more....ahhh i'm really out of it.  but i dont wanna goooooo...and stupid braces...sigh...broken already...watch...i'm gonna have them longer than 3 months.  having a laptop would be nice but i fear this will only lead to more hours of laying on my bed being a lazy bastard and days of leaning towards procrastination.  bah - 11:30 already...i woke up at 10ish and time went by so fast.  seriously....wish i could orb lol.  maybe i should take a shower to wake me up.  i should get a job...yes
