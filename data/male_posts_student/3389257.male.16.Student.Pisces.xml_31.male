Woo, go ice cream. Apart from the chocolate ice cream, today did not go well. At all. I am talking german and listening to further seems forever. At the same time. Sounds weird, really isn't that more than boring. Further Forever are good, buy "How to start a fire" when it comes out.  it was good to see friends from school again. I miss them alot much. Simon and his glands. Luke and his beach boy hair. Sanna and her coolness. Sara and her incredibly small feet. There are more, but there isn't a comical feature ot match anymore. I could of made them up like simon's glands. I am too lazy. My back hurts. I played cricket very poorly for too long.  Well I'll be going now. I can hear my name being called in Peru. Also called in some parts of Uganda. It means something more offensive up there. Don't spend you're time looking that up. I made it up.
