There is just one problem with it, it shouldn't be labeled with the Genre Horror. In fact its hard to place it in a Genre. It has many different elements and that's what makes it so great. I would recommend going to see it and if you have time see it twice. Have ever seen Mission Impossible? Its one of those movies were you can watch it 20 times and still find something new out, well The Village is just like that. I have seen it 3 times and it never gets old.
