If you go out to lunch by the time you get there you only have 10 minutes to eat before you have to leave.  It took me forever to decide what topic I wanted to do. However, once I picked it seemed like good topics came up everywhere, it's crazy how that always seems to happen.  I finally chose to do the benefits of extracurricular activities. It's actually interesting how being involved in an after-school club or sport is related to higher test scores and better attendence. It'd be interesting to see what everyone else came up with for their junior project. Have a fun time with all the nice weather while it lasts!   - Rachel Penny
