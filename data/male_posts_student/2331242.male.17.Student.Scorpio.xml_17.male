READERS: Well yeah, but we're sap mongers! ME: Martha is my girlfriend that I've kept under wraps for a while now, we talked about it and decided that it was too much trouble to always put "my girfriend or my boyfriend." READERS: You mean Martha from  urlLink Octopus' Garden ? *valley girl voice* Like, OMG! She's so cute! ME: Hehehe, yeah, I know *more stupid grins and Brian-nausea-inducing mushy goodness*  It's gotten to the point where I might want to stop being so.... descriptive.... in my blogs :) I dunno, I'll ask Martha about it and see what she thinks. On that note, let me just say that I was busy from 3:15 to 5:00, part of which was spent at Caribou, but most of it in the school parking lot *wink* Hehehe, I'm drowning in love here folks.  Maybe I ought to sober up (figuratively) before the concert. Ah yes, the concert! Well, we're gonna be laughed off the stage if the damn  freshman  don't get their act together. I'm the lone trumpet, and along with my brother and a few select other people, not to boast, but we're what's holding this band together. The saxophones are just plain volatile, and there's this one stubborn drummer who tries to be Devon from that movie drumline, a real arrogant hothead. Well, Matt and I gave them both a piece of our minds today, and for the most part, they took it well. We'll see how it turns out tonight. I'll see you there, Martha!
