With the world at their oyster, record sales in the teens, and live shows that--literally--shocked their neighbors, C + G took an unpublicized long-term break from the music business. Dave "Dio" Hill has built a second cult following in his side band, "Tops Markets." Joe "Licks" Ferguson just performed at the world-famous Grand Old Opry in Nashville, only to be kicked out for being too "Rock  Roll." Frederick Charles Thomas "John Paul Jones" Schrock has taken up award-winning photography and hosts the popular game show "Name That Smell." Well guess what. The band has reunited with a new member, Tim "Novice" Schrock on drums, a new name, The Squeaky Divas, and a new mission: To rocK with a capital K. Because K is a really tough consonant.
