I decided that my desire and blind hope for a good film outweighed the risk of wasting my money on crap.  Unfortunately, Ebert was mostly right.  That isn't to say there are some moments of redemption in the movie, but if you added the good together it would make a solid trailer.  The rest of the film was mostly forgettable.  I found myself thinking about work, the Blog, housework, my own writing and so forth, even during some of the more dramatic moments in the film.  The pace was ponderous, the tension flat, and the characters mostly empty.  When the Big Reveal comes, I had a Matrix Reloaded moment in miniature.    That being said, there were some positives in the film, but not enough positives for me to recommend seeing it.  And it pains me to say that, because unlike Mike, I've mostly enjoyed Night's films.  I enjoyed William Hurt's character - a man who wanders around the film with a woodenness that is actually appropriate.  I liked the formality and stiffness of the dialogue, which certainly gave it an antique feel.  We witness one of the most visceral and disturbing stabbings I think I've seen, remarkable for the casualness with which it occurs.  And finally, Bryce Dallas Howard, the daughter of Ron Howard, makes what is essentially her debut in a major role, and she's going to be something to watch in the future.  Her performance was one of few things that made the film watchable, and I think she's going to be commanding relatively large salary in the future.  She has some real acting talent, well beyond the current crop of 'I'm just a pretty face' actresses making the rounds today.  It's really a shame that this film suffered from such a weak story when you get right down to it.  I've been thinking about it now for a few hours, and it isn't too difficult to come up with a great many improved twists and story arcs from the original material.  I don't know much about Night and how he works, but I'm thinking that he should dump the 'Written, Produced and Directed by' trend and bring in some help.  He dreamed up some real potential here, but it needed an outside hand to help shape it into something stronger.  There was something here at the core, but he didn't bring it to the screen.  Too bad.  Night doesn't have to be 'the trick ending guy'.  I do believe he has a valid claim to Hitchcock, and he should stay with this type of material.  But he should also recognize his limits and bring in some fresh perspectives to help restore the meat to his projects.  I'll still see his films without hesitation, at least for the near future, but if he strings off another Village, I'll have to put him on my rental list.
