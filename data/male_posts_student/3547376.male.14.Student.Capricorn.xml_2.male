I like designing websites  advertising (banners, awards  posters).  I am currently working on a new website at MSN Groups. It is called Dark.Shadows ( urlLink Click here ). If your interested in dark culture  lifestyle, music, writings  dark communities, then take a look at Dark.Shadows.  I am also interested in music (mostly darkwave, gothic, metal, rock  punk rock), art, writing. computers  internet. When I leave school, I want to go to University  study Graphic Art (Commercial Art) or something in the music industry.  As a teenager of fourteen years, I lead a sad, depressing life. Which may explain why I am gothic. I have been in the gothic scene for only a few months now. I like dark, gloomy, creepy stuff like cofins, vampyres, spiders, spider webs, castles, death, ghosts  all that other stuff.  One reason my life is so sad  depressing is because of a secret I have carried on my sholders since I was twelve. A secret I find disturbing  shaking. I lead two lives because of this. One is a lie, which I reveal to everyone. My family  friends. The other can only be revealed to myself as no one know's. I can only reveal this life behing closed doors, away from the human eye.  What I find most shaking about this secret is that I have to reveal it to someone, soon. I cannot keep it inside of me for much longer. Everyday brings me closer to a mental breakdown. This is something else that no one know's.  I shall continue in my next post ...
