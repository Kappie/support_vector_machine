It's basically my opinions on America, which I chose to do because of the furore around Farenheit 9/11, and I've just finished dissecting the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and asserting what I agree with, what I disagree with and so forth. Now I'm gonna write a section of how America has deviated from its initial ideal and is something entirely disparate to what it set out to be. So I guess it has turned into something almost essay-ish. It's not a great work, but I'm enjoying writing it and distinguishing what my opinions on America actually are. Anyhoodles, I bought the 'Morning Star' newspaper this mourn, and was ashamed to discover that it is nothing more than a tabloid, a (much) more left-oriented version of the Sun. All the same, it has some fun stuff in, such as a column on Australian racial apartheid by the muchly venerable John Pilger. Alongside this, it provides a very non-mainstream perspective on events, and it reports what goes unreported in the press. "For peace and socialism", as they themselves say :)  I'd like to take this opportunity to accord myself with the International Court of Justice, in denouncing Israel's illegal occupation of the West Bank, encouraging their imminent withdrawl from Gaza, and the dismantling of the illegitimate, immoral and repugnant land-grabbing of the wall. Furthermore, I'd like to denounce Hamas and Islamic Jihad for sending suicide bombers into Israel to kill civilian Israeli's, which just exacerbates the situation. This war needs to be ended, now, it nauseates me that both sides are foolishly squabbling over land. I'm not going to go as far as Mordechai Vanunu and question Israel's legitimacy as a sovereign state, but I feel that any nation which kills, maims, oppresses, sectarianises (sp?) and subjugates needs to be cajoled into discontinuing such practices through trade embargoes. Anyway, peace out!
