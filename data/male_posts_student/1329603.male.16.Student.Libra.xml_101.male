People that I'd rather hadn't seen that comment. Not that they'll understand it. Eugh, I'm just in a mood with myself for... well, not exactly being selfish, just a little self-involved. *swears again* I need to make up my mind about a few things.  *shakes* Relaxing relaxing...  Random comment, I've learnt the vowel pronunciations for Swedish, now. Which is cool. For example, did you know that å in Swedish is either pronounced like the "aw" in Raw or the "o" in Scot, depending on whether it's long or short? I betcha didn't. Jon's pleased with himself on that front. 1 hour of learning, and I know how to pronounce å.  Also, had a natter with Hector, cause he caught the 94, and then we walked home, because he lives on my route of walking. So, that was quite weird. He's cast me as Mr. Hale. Those of you reading this who're from Tommies, or whom I have told who Mr. Hale is, will understand my annoyance.  Hooooooooojjjjjjjjs. Not in the mood of the century.  Quote of the day: "I might have known the bitch could bite, I might have known the cat had claws, I might have guessed your little secret. Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine! Who keeps herself so pure and clean, You'd be the cause, I had no doubt, When there is trouble hereabout. You play a virgin in the light, But need no urging in the night!"  From   At the End of The Day   From the musical   Les Misérables   Love, Jon ROskilly
