Jasmin (sp?) and Isabell (sp?) came over for Gwen's sleepover last night. I spent the majority of the time playing with Jasmin's hair. It's cool. She looks REALLY GOOD without her glasses on. I decided not to watch her sleeping, I think that would have made me a very disturbing kind of person. Isabell is scary and lesbian-straight, like Sam. But she's good looking too. How comes Gwen never has any bad-looking friends?  Anyway, knackered. I slept downstairs with the girls because they were being nicer than usual so I slept on the sofa. If you know what my sofa's like (Marx, you should, you've broken it a couple of times) then you'll know that's really uncomfortable. My back is killing me.  I just had a shower, I slept in yesterday's clothes. >_  I think I'll marry Jasmin's hair.  I'm set on asking Caroline if she's on MSN tomorrow. Doesn't that sound all planned? Still, I think it might be an idea.  Jasmin got annoyed at me playing with her hair and won't let me do it anymore. Waaah i_i.  Love, Jon Roskilly
