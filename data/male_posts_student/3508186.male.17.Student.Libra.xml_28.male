I payed Jen 30, bought some shoes, and ate out a few times. Hopefully I can get this video card sold so I can get more money. I talked to my mother and she's gotten another check from the money recieved from selling my grandfathers house. Last time it was 10500, this time it was 4500. So my mom is gonna fix up our old house and rent it out. She also said she was gonna give me some money for clothes and such. That's good news.  I'm happy that I'm going to Montana, sad that summer's almost over, happy because things are going somewhat smooth, sad because I'm single. I need to find someone, and I have opportunities, I just dont act apon them. Why cant I have girls fall into my life like they used to. I remember the night Tosha and Lindsey met us cruising. It was awesome, our whole involvement and things we had done are looked back apon as being so far in the past. I hope Tosha moves closer to Tahlequah and I can get in touch with her more.   On the note of girls, Josh, Sean and I were leaving Walmart and there were a van full of girls. We were sitting at the light and one of em leaned out the window and asked what was happenin. Of course we said something like "nothin" or "ehh." We had em follow us to a gas station and we talked for awhile. No spark of convor and the driver had a real bitchy attitude. Out of the three of us (the shyest one) I talked the most. We parted and that was that.   I guess if it wasnt meant to be then it wasnt meant to be. Girls come and go, great girls stay in my life forever.  END
