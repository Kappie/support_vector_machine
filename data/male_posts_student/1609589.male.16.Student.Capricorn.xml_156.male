I'll give you a marker for those of you who know.   START   Each person creates a physical sign, like waving their hands in the air or a peace sign(mine was headbanging to the right)  Someone is chosen to be put in the middle of the circle, and someone is chosen to give the first command.  The middle person looks at the "commander," and the commander does their symbol, then the symbol of someone else, making them the "commander" and the middle person has to tag the new commander before they can do their sign, then another one, etc.   END  We played that, it was fun.  The only reason i wrote this post was because I was trying to sleep, and a friend of mine's alarm went off(i had put it on her when i needed to talk to her about someone, i guess i accidentally saved it), and i decided to go ahead and write something before i attempted to crash again.  I'm wondering what i should do with the rest of these marshmallows before they go stale.  It's 7:40 in the morning, i guess i can get breakfast... or... something.  I've been working on a list of random thoughts, i'll post em up here as soon as i think it's long enough.
