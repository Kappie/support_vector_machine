Would you believe that I don't even own a cellular phone? But this one I just couldn't ignore any longer.  More than that, though I've never kept a diary, I've always had long, literary rants pop into my head, on a variety of subjects, and usually late at night. Normally, I would simply IM them to my friends, but it's been happening later and later, so that nobody's awake by the time I need to talk. And if I wait until the next morning, it's all fallen apart.  So, here I am. This will be my official place to brain dump, when nowhere else will do. But I think I'll let it sit for a while, accumulate some content, before I start telling my friends. Otherwise, they'll expect me to have something clever to say every day...
