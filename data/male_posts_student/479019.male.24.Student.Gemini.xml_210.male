Now I don't ever have to touch RealOne's music library to pull up songs by genre or year released. Oh yea... I'm up to 2670 MP3s full tagged. I tagged a bunch of stuff I've had on my hard drive for a while in addition to downloading a bunch of stuff ranging from the Archies, Wham!, to the Buzzcocks and the Kinks.  ***
