Scott, my mother's youngest brother, and my Dad were my partners in this quest into the woods in search of chilling air and campfires.  We made our way out from Ft.Worth where Scott and I met up with my Dad.  It took us a little longer than normal to get out to Ratcliff because we took I-45 a little longer down to Centerville and from there we crossed over.  The trip was interesting. It rained the entire time, from when we left to just about the time we entered the campsite.  Halfway to our destination the wipers go out on my Dad's Suburban.  That made it almost impossible to see, but we made it to the forest and got to our campsite without slamming into anything.
