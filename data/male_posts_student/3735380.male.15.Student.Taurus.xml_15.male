What freaks me out is that I have a flu, while I'm reading this book about bio-terror. It adds to the effect of the scare, but I don't think it's mentally healthy.  It's kinda like reading The Tell Tale Heart with your dad hammering something. Freaky, because you have sound effects.  Right now, I'll need to delay that book until I regain my health. Until then, I'll just try to enjoy the popcorn, chips, and tylenol I get from sitting in front of the computer for the rest of the week.
