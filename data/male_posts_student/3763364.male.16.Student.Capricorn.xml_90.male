No, for mine, the palaces will burn to the ground. In defense of my good name, I have caused ruin. A blood junkie, I am proficient in the subtle arts of murder and persuasion. My vigil is pure, purified, although we well know I am simply a devil in God's country. When the 11th hour comes, and judgement knocks upon us all, I will be nothing more than a boot scraper.     You know what they say about me? They say:  "That boy is clever like ice is cold!"
