Fucking A! yeps a usally day i nmy life and good in this hood. Yeps no one reads this so i am proud to say pretty much everyone suxs expect for a select few! which is like 2 out of millions! yeps so now i leave you with a couple of kick ass songs:   This first one goes out to a dear friend of minename Patches!    SR-71    "Right Now"     She clings to me like cellophane Fake plastic submarine Slowly driving me insane But now that's over  So what if the sex was great Just a temporary escape Another thing I grew to hate But now that's over  Why you always kick me when I'm high Knock me down till we see eye to eye Figured her out I know she May not be Miss Right but she'll do right now  I used to hang on every word Each lie was more absurd Kept me so insecure But now that's over  She taught me how to trust And to believe in us And then she taught me how to cuss ... that bitch!It's over  I used to be such a nice boy...       Next One Goes Out To another good friend Exit.....    BIG D AND THE KIDS TABLE    "She Won't Ever Figure It Out"   (she won't ever figure it out she won't ever figure it out) you're the one that they complain to - you take the time you give advice, you take the time you give advice - you're the one that they complain to - you take the time you give advice, she's gonna go back (catch on) no matter what he says or does, she's gonna go back (catch on) the drama's what she loves [repeat] don't be dumb can't you see don't be dumbcan't you see [chorus]       THANK YOU AND GOOD NICE LONGISLAND!!!!!!!!
