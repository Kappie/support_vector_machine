YES, OF COURSE! As soon as that baby starts to cry, I'll be there for it, when the rain starts to fall, i'll be there for it, like i've been there before, i'll be there for it, cause it's there for me tooo! Heeheeheee I made a funny...Well, I will try to keep you on a 2-hour update of the events of baby...And when I finish my Baby Journal I will publish it.  Lullaby I will sing to baby: "Strong Enough", "This is a Song for the Lonely", and:  If I could turn back time, If I could find a way, I'd take back those things that have made you, and you'd never be, if I could......Never mind, those are explicit words :D. Talk to you all later. Byes!
