Ethical conflict?  What were you expecting, you are gonna work for Al Capone?  Hehe.  Mando is an honest man. And he's too kind.  Too kind, in fact, that if someone tells him that "dirty money" is more practical in this time and age, he would accept investments on it!  Nah, Aside from his kindness, he carries these moral values that I really don't understand.  Actually I don't understand most moral values, especially traditional ones.    Although I am totally disturbed when people think I have no moral values, or my moral values are completely out of control.  Hell, what am I, Satan?  Spawn?  Wolverine?  I am not the fictitious anti-hero people think agnostics and athiests are.  Actually I want to be out of agnosticism and relive my Christian life.  However, when I pray more, the more I lose my faith.  And when I start to have faith in "The Guy", there's this daemon at the back of my mind taunting the back the skepticisms I bear.  Not that he's really a demon (afterall, daemon and demon are different), but then, would someone deny the inner desire (godlike or pleasure-wise) of someone that is wholly against "His" will a devil within?    Whatever.  I am out of context.  I may also need accountants.  I have a lot of accountacy friends and some of them are not actually dependable at some point.  I have doubts of their dependability in the work place......  And I hate people who unconditionally hate employment and love MLM, and vice-versa.  Wala lang.  IT is so like religion.  Excuse me.
