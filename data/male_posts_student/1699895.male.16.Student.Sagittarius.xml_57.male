There are so many thing i wanna do this summer, so mur.  Today was only biology final, and then sci fi we just played halo.  Got a ride to drews house from dave and moaty, dave, mur, and I halo'd it up.  Then chad came, along with little dave and yang, so i left and went to wendys since i was still hungry ya kno. Then went to the grant hockey game and watched them get clobbered.  It was still fun though.  Now I'm at murs, and I'm about to go to sleep.  ERRR I still cannot find the CD with all the pictures on it. My search still continues...  well, since its summer, lets just say, i have nothing to do but be fat, so just call me or wuteve and we can do sumthing maybe.  mur
