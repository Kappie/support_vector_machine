This morning I woke up dimly remembering a situation in which I was in Japan with someone telling me I no longer care.  And it's true. I thought it just must be a morning fluke, or maybe a day fluke, which I suppose it could still be. But as of right now, I seem to no longer care about Japanese.  Before we all gasp and die, lets review me. Anyone who knows me is aware that I have an extremely obsessive personality. I latch onto a person, TV show, language, job, game, movie, country, celebrity, etc. and immerse myself, often at the cost of money, productivity, morals, and a lot of free time.  This isn't the first time I've woken up and had no interest in something that used to captivate me. Religion, film, theatre, video games, certain crushes, I've been obsessed with everything at one point or another. And I'm taking this extremely well I think, considering this puts me back at square one for "what the hell I want to do with the rest of my life".  So next quarter I will be fulfilling my promise to Shiranne and taking Japanese 3 with her. It will probably be the last Japanese class I take. Clearly I'll be changing my major to something else. I have no clue what. Any suggestions?  And no, I don't think this is just a weird day. I know myself. It's weird, but this is how I work. My life is doomed. I'll never like anything for more than a period of time.
