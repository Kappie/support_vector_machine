You've been the best big brother anyone could ask for. Whether we were making fun of band bands of movies or you explaining the greatness of The Beatles to me, you've been great! Hope your b'day is full of happiness, especially with your new 51" Sony HD TV. Have a good one, man!   And everyone from Suburban Myths, we say, "Happy birthday, Max!"
