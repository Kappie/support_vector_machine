We were shocked by 4 direct,long shot goals and replied by a brilliant run and finish by Dzaki in the first period. We slowly began to wake up in the second period as we began to start controlling the game and slow the pace down a little to suit us. Shots by NP began to lessen and we get more sniffs at goal. However,2 goals were conceded amid errors but we managed to reply again via a fantastic drag shot from Faliq from half-court. It was worth celebrating as we began on a mission to score as well as defend stoically. In the third period, play was intense as fouls were rampant from both sides. Shamil had his stick broken,while Rizal was pushed rather roughly into the boards. Luckily,there were no fights but NP scored another goal which caught us rather unaware. However,congratulations to us as well as NP for giving us valuable team experience for the IVP. HIP HIP HOORAY!  1. Everyone did well just that we sorta wasn't prepared for an onslaught. We werent mobile too n my performance sucked personally. Sorry dudes. 2. Our centre-save strategy worked well. Congrats to all defenders. The NP players were limited to long range shots from the sides. However,they were just too accurate with their long shots. 3. Congratulations to both goalscorers,Dzaki and Faliq. They took their chances and deserved their goals. Three cheers for them! HIP HIP HOORAY!  Next week,a friendly against ITE WEST CLEMENTI will commence at 2pm on Sunday. It will be confirmed as soon as possible and more updates will be posted here. and one more thing guyz. Cut the slack. As Jie Hong had said,we need to be more focused from now on. A loss of focus is equivalent to a loss. Adioz.  Maxigencical Corporation.
