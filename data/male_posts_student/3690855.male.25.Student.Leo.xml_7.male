At the risk of sounding like an ROH fanboy (which I am not, though I do enjoy watching some of their product) I really enjoyed the main show.  Doug Williams is a fantastic wrestler, and really needs to get his due.  His matches, first the four way match with Jay Lethal, John Walters, and Nigel McGuinness, then the Pure Wrestling title match later in the show with Alex Shelley, were both fantastic.  I really liked his exchanges with Nigel.  Since they both work British style, it looks so much different from the styles that everybody else wrestles that it looks unique and is fun to watch.  Certainly it's better than watching everybody work WWE style in that company, not that the style doesn't have its strong points, but when everybody wrestles the same style, it gets kind of boring after a while, not to mention the fact that some people aren't as good working that style as they would be another style.  Then you have people like Randy Orton, who would suck no matter what style they work.  :)   (That was a shout out to my man Jeff, who isn't reading this, because he hasn't read any of these blog items, but he loves Randy Orton for some reason even though he sucks).    So that was what I did on Saturday.  What else have I done lately?  Well, I was supposed to audition for Who Wants to be a Millionaire tomorrow, but they never sent me the paperwork so I'm not going to bother.  I'll probably hang out with Jeff at his apartment instead.  I bought him an Andy Pettitte action figure in between shows on Saturday at the Toys R Us, so he has that to look forward to.  School is fairly easy this week, as all I have is a brief meeting with my professor sometime Thursday afternoon, then I do my show from 12-3 PM EST.  Then I go home and I'll be home in time for dinner, which will be nice.  I work four days this week, as I'm going broke and need the money.  If anybody wants to give me money, feel free.    Also my parents and I have been planning my graduation party.  They're assuming I'm going to graduate in August (as am I, I would be shocked at this point if I didn't).  Just the usual stuff, inviting friends and family, planning out what to eat.  As long as I have burgers, my dad's sausage and peppers, my mom's potato salad, some shrimp, and a good dessert, I'll be happy.  I'm easy to please, what can I say.  Anyway, that's all for now.  Look for an update and a slight overhaul to the main Cox's Corner page at www.coxscorner.org soon, perhaps tomorrow.  I want to add some things to the layout, perhaps move some things around, make it more interesting.  We'll see what happens.
