My life remains relatively straightforward, as I know exactly what I want, and why I want it. People should take note from me.....I'm such a pretentious dick.  I've noticed some major differences between other peoples' blogs and mine. Whereas a lot of people I know speak in semi-poetic cryptic pretty stuff, I tell it like it is. What does that say? I think I just don't have the talent.    I deleted the poem, because it was teh suck.
