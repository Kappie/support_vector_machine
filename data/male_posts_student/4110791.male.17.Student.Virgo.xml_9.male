I would like to start out by saying that I am 17, soon to be 18 :)  While my girlfriend Kendall just turned 17 :)  And I will start out by saying that I love her VERY much, and I don't know what I would do without her :S  I always want to be with her, nomatter what :)  I always want to be able to be with her, to hold her, to kiss her, even when I know I can't :S
