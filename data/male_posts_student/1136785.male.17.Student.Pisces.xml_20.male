Those who know me may understand what I'm referring too, and I ask the Yalies in the background to humor my melodramatic emo-ness or find another goddamned spot to flirt.   It is true - my last, my best chance of political redemption proved to be yet another fevered dream of a madman, who never got that it is no longer freshman year out of his head. Those were the days - at the mere drop of the hat I could crap out some comedic bullshit and win any election in the blink of an eye. Almost without effort I was the president of our Freshmen Class (admittedly only in second semester as I was disqualified for insulting my opponents for the first one) and as the President of my Sophmore Class as well. In that time I set up both Homecoming and WPA! But the end of my sophmore year proved that the days of wine and roses were sorely over. I, unconcievably, lost my bid for Junior Class Election, against Julia fucking Falk - a complete unknown who was apparently much more popular than me in the Junior Class. I who had two years of experience, of building dances, of Student Goverment, of the Non-Academic Life Committee! After overcoming the bitter sadness and acidic anger (look at me, I'm fucking alliterating) at that loss, I sat myself down, said everything would be ok and moved on. Thereafter I went on to lose three more elections in a row - two of them in the same club. I was the only one who voted for me as Thespian President and Vice-President, and the only one to vote for me as YiG President. This one still riles up my blood if only for the quality of the people I lost too, people so repugnant (at least back then) that it makes me want to vomit. Luckily, thereare three At-Large Representatives for the Student Body, and I was one of three who ran, so I nailed that one! I then went on to promptly lose the chance, which all At-Large Reps have, to become Vice President of Student Goverment. My year was over, and I was infuriated. But I managed to calm down, and believed in the possibility of bigger and better things.   Junior year started abruptly enough - theater proved itself all the more harder for me to pretend to skilled at, what with the influx of new, actual talent. But that's niether here nor there. Actually, I'm wrong - its fairly related. With the loss of any actual role in play and therefore that much responsibility I was left with more time to dream, more time to piddle around. Luckily this time was concurrent with Youth in Goverment, and I finished my plans to run as a candidate as Governor from the Western District. I was the only one to file the paperwork on time, so that nomination was mine! But I showed up late to the district convention, and thus they openened to floor t more candidates. One of these candidates who seld nominated themselves was from my own, the Pembroke Hill, delegation! A scream of "I'll gut you from neck to sternum" certainly did not help my chances to win the nomination. Some are creatures of their humors, but I am one of my bile.  And yet I prepared a speech, where in one part I stated "I'm also stage manager for our current play - and if I can keep a bunch of monkeys in line I think I can make a fairly effective governor." The person after me, representing an absentee who had never entertained any thought of being Governor, simply stated "Vote Tougis, because he won't call you monkeys!" THE FUCKING BASTARD TWISTED MY FUCKING WORDS! And of course his delegation dominated the Western District, and despite being the only one to properly fill all of work on time, and prepare to be governor, I had lost the nomination - no thanks to my own delegation.  The sheer rage that threatened to melt my hear cannot simply be measured at this action. I believe I literally began, as I left, to almost cry and convulse.  But I eventually convinced myself to continue YiG, and I went to the convention - no small thanks in part to the fact I learn I could be a write-in-candidate for governor. It would require over two hundred signatures from all over the four districts, but I was willing. I was all decked out with hat and sleek mafioso wear, filled with signs, nametags, and t-shirts proclaiming "Vote Tyson for Governor!" I got those damned signatures in less than one day, in-fact I was the first to get them in. I say first because another, the one who would would take the title, was also a write in. Now our district, the Western, is one of the smaller ones, nothing compared to eastern - which has all the massive magnet schools from the St. Louis Area. People have a tendency to block vote to support one's district, so I knew I had to leave a veritable blazing path across their soul with my speech. So what do I do? I FUCKING CHOKE! IN FRONT OF SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE I FUCKING CHOKED. Those are levels of embarassment that should not be known to one as agnsty as myself, but quite often are. 'Luckily' my speech was so bad I quickly made my peace with the election and simply hoped that the delegation of the liars (The actual candidate turned out to be a cool, if bland, hippie who had no real idea what he was doing) would suffer my fate as well. To no suprise, East swept the elections. I still felt like shit, but I managed to jump immediately into another role in a group I actually cared about - Chief Lobbyist. The Lobbyists this year seemed to like me, and with my failed bid for governor and my previous awards as a Lobbyist, I had hoped that I had that in the bag. But no - there was fourteen people in the room. We all voted and our adult leader announced that it was a close race, seven to six. The current chief lobbyist, whom I considered a a decent friend, suddenly remembered that she hadn't voted - we were all anxious, worried that this could be a seven to seven split. So she whispered her choice to our adult, and he said '"Good Choice, eight to six. Congratulations [blank]" She had voted against me in front of my own eyes. There wasn't even any semblance of secrecy for whom she voted for! As per my personality (Drama Queen/Prima Donna) I immediately sank into another depression and spent the bus trip home moping.  But in my heart (Man am I in a fucking soap opera here?) I knew that this was not what I was truely preparing for. I was going to use this failed leap for sovereignty as an example of what not to do for the prize I truly desired - Student Goverment President.   It may be hard for some of you to understand just how much I wanted that spot, why I sunk over one hundred dollars of my own birthday money into my campaign supplies, or why I'm acting the way I am now. Student Goverment President is the position I've desired ever since my first assembly in High School. He got to make all of the announcements, to be as funny or as serious as he wanted. But more than that, he actually did things! He assembled the blood drive, helped with the Valet Auction, raised money for Jan-Term Scholarship - and so much more. Depending on his will to actually work, he could completely change things while in power! Clubs trembled in fear for the hope of clemency in his desicions. Any action affecting the student body was routed through him. Sure this was the way I could prove myself! Soon, that mantra became "Sure this is that way I can redeem myself!" Now, you may have been questioning my motives for running throughout all of these elections - and its hard to explain. I kinda fell into it, like theater, but then is became a method of self-improvement. I have always been terrified of speaking in front of people, of leading a group on the correct course - what better way to overcome this fear than force myself to perform these very tasks repeatedly? It was all probably linked to the fact that I've never grown up, that I still harbor delusions of grandeur, of being some superhero or god to the masses. My bloated ego was blossoming full speed.  So I prepared like I've never prepared before for this, the grandest of all elections. I through away all trifilings of perhaps joining the newspaper, making my own Historical Society - all silly notions - and focused soley on the prize. I even laid out a decent speech, and got together a core of friends to make the impossible possible. We spent hours (admittedly on only one day) making posters and T-Shirts, and I spent hours more making smaller, computer posters and nametags. I got to school early and plastered myself everywhere. I was taking this seriously - but so was my opposition.   But the two and a half days of campaigning are negligent now, and my speech, though actually good this time, probably didn't affect the vote at all. It was declared a tie between Aroop and I, with Joe knocked out, and that there would be run off elections monday - today. Aroop and I were both tired, and agreed to no more campaigning, which I still hold probably would have not done anything. Maybe I was wrong, but at 12:10 am April 5th, I failed yet again. I've lost more elections than I would like to recall, and frankly I'm kinda tired with this whole system.  I was unable to get a senior class slate together because the due date was friday and the extension in elections made it impossible, so that left my major standby unavailable to me. I can't practically create my Historical Society, as it would merely appear to be College Resume building - so I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't know if I'll go out for At-Large again. I know I could win, and probably be Vice-Pres too. But I don't know. Its bad enough that I'm gonna squirm at assemblies in envy and jealousy, but I don't know if I can serve under him. I'm just tired, fucking mentally exhausted. I've lost the spirit, and realized its over. Its bad enough to overhear why people didn't want me while strolling through the halls. Sure I hate them even more, but even thats lost its spice. All this hate and anger, yet no outlet. I don't know how to feel about this anymore, other than I'm going to be so fucking emo for the next day or two.  I find it highly ironic that I'm going to go memorize that overdone hack solliliquy from Hamlet now.
