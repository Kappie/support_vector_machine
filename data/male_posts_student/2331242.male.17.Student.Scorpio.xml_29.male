I made one about everyone's favorite Tarutaru, Epsilonia. The page is actually quite good, but don't expect me to update the "diary" portion ever again :) It was just a comp sci project. I dunno, maybe I'll mess around with it some more in the future.   urlLink Click here to see the site.   Maybe I'll rant some this weekend when I get some energy. Maybe.
