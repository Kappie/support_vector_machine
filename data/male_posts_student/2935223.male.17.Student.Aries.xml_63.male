I didn't even really notice until today, well, I did notice.  I just pushed it aside.    I can't believe myself.  I have been willfully blinded.  GODDAMNIT!!! Then I learned about sum things that Kyle has been sayin' about me...once again, behind my back.  Tina has always wondered why I get angry at her.  WHY THE FUCK WOULDN'T I GET ANGRY!?!?!?!?  I mean, come on.  I have just been led around by her this whole time, I was just a puppet. You know what the real fuckin' icing on the cake is.... I will accept her back.  I know it.  I JUST know it.    Why do I continually torture myself.  I wish it was all over. I need a vacation bad....REAL bad. Peace Out!  Spense
