As in, that shirt is Josh Mattson. After that, it was decided that Josh Mattson isn't very Josh Mattson. Then, we went on to talk about the emo side of counter culture and then on to things we hate in general. A very funny conversation.  Once again, my theory that Mattson ruins everything. First, he is coming to the party late. Then, he doesn't even come at all. Finally, he asks if we are going to stop and play with them after the party... That just sucks. And  he  calls  me  a sellout.
