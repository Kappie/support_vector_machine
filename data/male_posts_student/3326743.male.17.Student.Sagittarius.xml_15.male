I've become so frustrated with the school and people b/c they just don't get it.  They seem to ignore the Bible on some points and to take such weak views.  I hate to call myself strong, but in this case that's how Paul puts it.  Read the passage, think about it, and I'm going to try to practice it.  Daniel I'll talk to you later about our phone conversation.  See you.
