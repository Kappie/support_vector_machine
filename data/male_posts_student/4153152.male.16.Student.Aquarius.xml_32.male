I'll probably go and see it again, mostly because it's extremely funny but also because I want to take a closer listen to the sound track.  I wanted to get some footage linked together and get a promo halfway done today or tomorrow, but I've found that my tempo replacement hard drive is actually too slow to handle the data of reading both a video and a sound track. You can't tell me that's not sad. I am hoping to get my replacement hard drive back Thursday or Friday. Once that's done I will try and get a second here ASAP and then I can really get some editing done. Thursday we'll be doing a little filming again. (Or at least try to) When Thursday's over scene 1 should be pretty much history. That is, if everybody can make it. We'll have at least 3, probably 4, and maybe, just maybe 5.  I'm still working on the server. I found Windows 98, but I didn't get to installing it tonight. Hopefully a clean install will run a little better than what was on there before. That was painful. Although I guess it did take about as long to boot up as linux, linux was just showing my messages, so it didn't seem as long. I think I will just use the DOS portion when I get everything installed. That way I will have very little overhead.  I've got to work tomorrow, we've gotten pretty far behind. Although it's not like we haven't been behind since June. Well, I guess there was one day in the middle of June where we had one system in. That was nice. The two days after that though, we got nine systems. No matter how you look at it, that's pretty messed up. I'll be heading in at about 9 or 9:30 and staying until 3ish. I need some time tomorrow afternoon to prepare for having 5 people in my house. I may go back after hours though. I enjoy doing some time after hours, because then I don't have to deal with the public as much. I don't answer the phone, and walk-ins are the only people I talk to. I prefer that because I can get more work done, and do it more efficiently. Plus, there are no service calls. It seems like every time I go in during the day to get some extra work in, I get hit with a service call. Every. Time.  Well if I'm to get up at 7:30 I'll need to hit the sack. I'll be around, maybe from work, maybe tomorrow evening. If I'm not back...well then assume I have nothing to say.
