I thought the movie was alright, drug on and on but i like airplanes and the space stuff and growin' up in kettering ohio where the WRIGHT brothers WERE born AND LIVED thats right the orville and wilbur wright used to live like 2 miles from me:-) yeaaa but ne ways The movie really showed how women were just kinda sittin on the back burner the whole movie was about men, and then the women were just at home waitin to see if theyd come home alive or not. It really supported everything i had learned about the 50's and 60's from miss clarks eye of the tiger lectures! BUT YES now i must finish my we didnt start the fire EC! YESSS have a WONDERFUL SUNNY DAY! FOR u overacheiver ap'ers PLEASE AT least study OUTSIDE!!! ENJOY! JESS K( as in kolkmeyer)
