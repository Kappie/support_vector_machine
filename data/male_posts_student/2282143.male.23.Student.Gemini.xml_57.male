Even according to them, Catholocism is a pagan cult.  Of all organized religions, and even with the hundreds of years of craziness, I still like the Roman Catholic Church best.  But then again, I dont really know too many others except for baptist and crazy ass hellfire ones like this.  But it really just freaks me out that people are like this.  If I do not agree with a religion or dogma, I will say I dont agree with with it but I will not tell them what to believe.  God is a lie?  Jesus is a lie?  Honestly, I dont know the answers to these questions, and honestly I dont think anyone else has those answers.  No one knows, and all we have is that faith that God is either there or not there.  You can worship the dog poop in your backyard for its ability to fertilize the earth if you would like.  Just please dont go shoving it in my face.  Keen analogy?  Not one religion is right, and until people open their God damn eyes and accept this, then we are all doomed to live in chaos.
