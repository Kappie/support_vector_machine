Anyhow, I released the Flash movie yesterday, so yall can go over to  urlLink our website  now and check it out. Fred says he'll make a weird Kid Pix Slide Show, so I'll look forward to that. As you can tell I'm still in love with Monty Python, because Monty Python is awesome. And now for something completely different: I really want to go see Fahrenheit 9/11 today or sometime soon. Yeah. Oh, and I'm going to lay off making Flash movies for a while. I think I need a little vacation from it, though I will be writing some comedy material and sending it to the Late Night with Conan O'Brian writers for a response, some tips, and just laughs on my part. Yeah. Until later, Asta La Vista, Baby.
