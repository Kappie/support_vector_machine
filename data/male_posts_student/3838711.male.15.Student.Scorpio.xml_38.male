Basically I stayed at home till about evening when I headed down to Sembawang to my godfather's funeral again, on the way I parted from my parents to fulfil my sudden craving for KFC spicy chicken, and stole some 25 minutes to play some cheap Wangan before I took bus 859 down to their block....  Tried 760/DG on my R34 (since its missing the last 2 upgrades, so no 800/DG), didnt found it to be up to expectation, since top speed was only 330kmh. Wanted something like 350+, but I dont think thats possible. Meh, my New Belt Line Clockwise timing is still stuck at 4'39'397... With the BlackBird... Hope can get it down to 4'37'500...  So this was pretty much my day, I seriously didnt find much worth the mentioning to blog about.  On a side note, my eyes still felt pretty tired, and on the way home, some drunkard vomited on the bus step... By just about 5 seconds more he could have touched earth and spilled his crap there ! He made the damn bus smell like a rubbish dump... and the driver was so pissed... a black face... lol.  Maybe I'll try to get myself to study some english, since its my CA paper on Wednesday, along with my physics retest. For now, its my beauty sleep again ! Ja !
