Super Japanese Day!!!   is an annual festival held by the Buddhist church across the street from my house in which they celebrate, you know, Japanese shit. I'm pretty sure they don't  really  call the celebration   Super Japanese Day!!! -- but if they did, that'd be pretty fucking awesome. Technically, all I have to do to find out the official title of the party is walk outside and look across the street, but I'm too lazy and I'm wearing my skivvies (settle down, Zara).          Anysuch, Zara had to work there since she's like an honorary Jap or something, so I met her while she was working. I bought this kickass samurai sword and went  urlLink Uma  on Zara's honorary- urlLink nipper -ass, then we ditched her little booth and trekked over to Jamba Juice. I killed Zara with my sword [ urlLink ! ] and walked back to the church, where I proceeded to make love to her foxxy mother.          [ WARNING:  The  urlLink Angus Diet  is  not  a real   diet!!!1]          I haven't had a real conversation with  urlLink Mary  for a couple days, and you know what? I don't care all that much. I'm finally starting to get over that repugnant bitch.               -chuck-     ...or eat limes...
