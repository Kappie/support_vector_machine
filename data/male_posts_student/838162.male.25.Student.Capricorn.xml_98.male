I mean, who would name a year after such a chaotic creature due to the very fact that they are the smartest animal around? (arguably the smartest if you take humans into account...actually now that I think about it...) Or maybe it's because I just find monkeys funny. Well whatever the case it seems to me that you're just asking for trouble if you call anything "monkey". I'm pretty sure even the monkeys take offence at it.  In light of this, the Chinese New Year celebrations passed without much trouble or fanfare. Other than the fact that it is exceptionally early this year. Not that I'm complaining of course. Celebrate the New Year twice in the same month? No Problem! Not that I would actually go out and party...that would be so unlike me.  At the end of it all, I realize that I should spend more time with my cousins. I seem to learn something new from them every year. Simple exchange of information that would point me towards a useful resource or idea, I hope to make sure that I'm able to give a useful piece of advice myself each time.  Speaking of spending more time with people, I'm finally settling down and getting to know my fellow coursemates.Of course there will always be the odd cliche here and there but all in all it's a pretty good group. Of note is the fact that more than half of them are forgien students, mainly from Indonsia and Malaysia, which means I'm actually exposed to different cultures and countries without having to go study overseas like I originally planned. Not bad. I hope to be able to get to know them better for we all may not continue taking the same modules throughout the whole year.  As the schoolwork piles up and the projects, assignments and tests approach, I will have to start focusing more firmly on them. This does not bode well for my new interest in Computer Music and production for it also requires a substansial amount of time to be invested in overcoming the learning curve. Oh well, we will have to see how it goes.
