This doesn't mean that I have forgiven anyone for making me feel the way I did, as far as I'm concerned, if they think of me the way they do, and they don't apologise, tell me I was wrong, blah blah etc., they can go screw themselves and get out of my life.  The two friends I'd like to thank are; Natalie, Jim and Kirsty. Thank-you so much for your help, loving careand wisdom. I'll never forget this, and I am in your debt.   Thank you   Paul
