AHHHH!!! why wont the damn lazer place hire me! im so good at that! i dont want to end up working at Rax!!!(for any of you who dont know, rax is the south's equivalent to an underfunded macdonalds. you can almost smell the sleaze coming off the place...and i think theyre hiring)  Meh, i wanted to talk to people las night, but i was sleeping...however, the french comment rachel left proved to be most entertaining in literal form:  my expensive, I t'aime has the insane one. you misses me much because you are the only one which could make me laugh when badly j'avais times my beautiful love, I think always has you.  hmmm...i hope thats what it really translates to, casue then french would be the best language ever. well, back to Morrowind then..oh right, i got morrowind working. badly, but i can play! haha, in your face mimimum requirements and U.S. Law! i need niether a good computer or money to play video games anymore!
