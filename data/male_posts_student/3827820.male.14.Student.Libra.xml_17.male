Polypeptides, restriction enzymes, cheese-making, wine-making, nucleotides, DNA replication, mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, Uracil, cloning, anticodons, sequence, bah! *Brain flooded with information...  Can't think much about what happened today...  Oh yeah, the only thing I remember I did today is I went to Junction 8 to watch "I, Robot". Great movie, great time with Sunny, the NS-5 robot... this reminds me of Lu Jie (who is probably mugging for Bio Test like "siao"), who is a cyborg...  Teddy-O-Ted, collapsing for Bio Test! Must get A1! Get A1! (but I only have faith in Lu Jie)  *Tips of the day - (can't think of a thing)...
