People tends to be blur at times, lol  Just now, i was watching the tv, tinking tat its late and the volume is too high already.. I tried to turn down the volume of my tv... As i turn down the volume, i was tinking, why no reaction one, and i tried turning up and down to see any difference.. No, no reaction at all.. So i turned my head around to see whether the knob is working... Wait a minute, knob? Shouldnt the volume control of the tv just buttons? And finally, i discovered, im turning the knob of my computer speakers.... Erm ok, u can stop laughing now... ok! lol  A few months back, i was meeting up with my platoon mates for a movie, so everyting set, on liao, when i had reached orchard, i was on Lido side.....  i called them up: where are u guys?   they: We are at HMV...  me: do u guys wan to come down to the cinema to look for me? so i dun need to walk there and back..  they: ok, which cinema are you at?  me: Lido  they: har? Lido? isnt tat in orchard?  me: ya, then how? or u wan to watch at cineleisure?  they: we at HMV  CITYLINK  leh..... DAMN, do u believe it? Somehow, i had mixed up city hall and orchard, this one is the blurest ting i had ever done in all of my 23 years of life... Power rite? lol  The two incidents above are power ones, im adding in a not-so-power one as dessert for u guys... As i was heading home, i sat on the bus and was in deep thoughts.. So i was tinking about a lot of tings, and then when i finally "regain consciousness" I was already like 5 bus-stops away from my destination, lol, i tink tis happened to me like two times... Haiz  Blur blur blur, so blur sia, ok please stop laughing, thanks   Current Mood: Cheerful   Current Music: Noriko Sakai - Tenka muteki no ai
