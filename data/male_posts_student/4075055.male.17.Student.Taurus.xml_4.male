I was gonna go out this evening but people was tired, I'm going camping tomorrow night and having a bbq but I'll go out in the day time and hang around for a bit with people.   I've had a wierd headache today, it's been going on and off all day at wierd times and it's been pissing me off but it's gone off now which is good.   Talking to someone for a good few hours today which was good, she was asking me alot of questions because she wanted to get to know me better or something, and she said I was cute and things like that a few times which was good, I sorta hinted at the idea of hanging out but very vaguely and didn't really say much at all, haha. Oh well, I'm hoping to hang out at least once before this holiday is over, I'd like to get to know her alot more.   I've got the house to myself for most of tomorrow until early eveningish around half 6. If I would have known earlier I could have organised something round here but I'm just gonna go out instead and save the hastle.   I'm getting broadband next week which should be exciting and very handy since I've finally got a decent internet speed which I'm very much looking foreward too, for downloads and being able to watch streaming movies and stuff etc..   I've spent most of my day sleeping and doing the collage artwork for Helen for the happy august forum swap thing..I'll be getting mine on Monday hopefully if it's sent on time, I have no idea who got me but I'm looking foreward to getting it and finding out who it's from.   I'm getting quite into photography, Helen has given me some tips for beginners and recomended some early cameras to start off with, there are a few on ebay and theres one going quite cheap but it's got a day to go yet. Dad seems quite keen on me getting interested in something like that and he might help to pay for such a thing if it isnt too expensive, it's under £10 for the camera at the moment and it usually goes for around £70/90 so I'll keep a watch on it and see how it goes...
