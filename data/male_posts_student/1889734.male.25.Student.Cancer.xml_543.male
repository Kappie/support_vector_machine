I am filled with rage against Islam this morning.  I am so utterly sickened by this so called religion.  Where are the condemnations from Islamic leaders?  Where are the Islamic charities rushing aid to their fellow muslims wounded and widowed by the blasts?   I'm so sick and tired of Europeans and UNers and World Leaders prattling on and on about the religion of peace, and how our war is not with Islam.  In the face of so much slaughter in the name of Allah, how can we continue to be so stupid and blind to the reality of what Islam is forcing upon us?    I hate that I have come to this.  Religious tolerance is indeed a cornerstone of our values, but a line has to be drawn when the tolerated religion is focused towards slaughtering all others in the name of their god.  Until a significant splinter of Muslims stand up and begin to preach against this nihilistic culture, I can't accord them any respect.  In fact, this morning I am lusting for the death of MORE muslims.  I want those that praise these bombings to die.  I want those who associate with these thugs to die.  I want to answer death with death, and some part of me is ashamed of what they are bringing me to.  We should begin executing al Qaeda people the same night a bomb goes off.  Wrap their pathetic bodies in bacon and leave them for the dogs to consume.  Begin summary executions of anyone found possessing arms in Iraq without authorization.  Preach hatred from a mosque - you die.  Shut down the religious schools and kill any teacher that praises violence in the name of Allah.  Pick up a stone and through it at an Allied soldier - you die.  I'm so tired of this.  I'm so tired of watching a whole region fester in barbarism for generations while the rest of the world tries to pretend that the root cause is Arab humiliation at the hands of those Zionist Jews.  They excuse Arab hatred by engaging in Semitic hatred.    We are at war with a culture of death, propogated by a religion of hate.  We are not going to civilize them by acting in civil ways.  The judicial system of our courts is not the appropriate way to deal with barbarians.  We need Roman ways in modern times.    And I really hate what that means.  I hate the death and the destruction, and I hate what they will force us to do in order to preserve our culture.  Best be harsh and brutal and be done with it.  The innocent people in Iraqi deserve a chance to build a decent culture, free from a thousand years of a failed faith.  Most of these people just want to live in peace, free to raise a family and make a living.  We have never experienced such opression in our own past, and it is difficult to imagine what this does to a societies will to resist the Islamist.  They need help, and I believe we have a duty to provide that help.  We can't hand them a new life, but those that wish to struggle and change deserve our attention.  As it is, our precious sensibilities against infringing on the religion of peace gets in the way of our ability to help those that would fight for freedom.  Let's get on with helping these people.  Let's get on with killing those that will never accept peace without the iron reign of a childish, hating, death loving diety.  Begin the Roman methods of pacification.  They worked in the past.
