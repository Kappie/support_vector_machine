I was supposed to call her at a quarter to eight to give her feedback about a client I was supposed to meet at 0700. I didn't answer the call of course. I jumped out of bed, rushed to the bathroom and had the quickest shower possible. I then realised that I had actually broken my younger brother's record. That boy would get under the shower and exit before you finished brushing your teeth. I was out of the house the house by 0810. Rushed down to the client's office and blamed my lateness on the traffic. Honestly, there wasn't any traffic on the way. I only live about 3 miles away but the client doesn't know. She does not need to know, its strictly confidential. Anyway, we finished the meeting in no time called my boss later and told her whatever she wanted to know. She did not even bother to ask me why I did not answer my phone when she called. I went back home and had a proper breakfast before going to the office which is on the other side of the world (thats what we say when u travel from west London to east London or vice-versa). I've had a nice day at work today and it's Friday tomorrow. God bless. I will get to know when my friend's wife's funeral will be held tonite or tomorrow. We will and then pay her our last respect before we meet again. Still can't get over the fact that she's no longer with us.
