And we reserved hotel rooms for Friday night and Saturday night, game one being at 11 o clock Saturday morning.  So midweek she is having doubts about going down tonight (Friday) and her doubts grow and grow. So today when I'm leaving to go to watch a soccer game shes like I'm gonna cancel the reservations. I couldnt believe it so now I'm stuck here and I get to drive for 3-4 hours to get to a soccer game.   Highland-3 Kammerer-1  2 Years in a row
