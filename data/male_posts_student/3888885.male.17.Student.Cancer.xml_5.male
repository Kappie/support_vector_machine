Darn. I wish thgs were more different... god help me.  Adding stuff 2 my entry 2day... well... ppl may tink i'm turnin gay. tts bad. cos i'm not. but now i may haf a betta idea of y ppl turn homosexual... lack of trust in e opposite sex? haha but i'm still heterosexual thank u v much. setting ur eyes upon demure femininity is  definitely more pleasant than a bunch of hairy hulks... gimme a break, gals still rock.  well guess i'm feelin betta now tt i've let out... mayb dis blog stuff isnt so bad after all... jez tt it may b tedious 2 update so frequently. oh well...  good to be straight. but i suppose ppl haf deir reasons. i'm a homophobe tho. been stalked by dis gay pervert b4... but shall not go into details *shudders*  i am a mat, a mat is very emotional, therefore i'm very emotional.  Rai out.
