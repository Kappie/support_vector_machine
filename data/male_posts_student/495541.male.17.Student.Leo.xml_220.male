I have an unusual pain just below my stomach to the right.  My thoughts are that my appendix is going to explode, but I can’t be sure.  This weekend I spend a lot of Saturday rearranging my the computer area in my house.  I now have a desk and not a corner part.  I like it much more because I am not angled.  I am looking in the direction of the wall instead of an angle on the corner that I hate.  I always bumped my knee on the sharp under parts of the metal support structure thing a mah-bobbers.  I don’t know what you would call them, but the cut I got from it gave me a nice scar above my knee.  But in addition to moving everything around, we changed the network to allow more users and the wireless router works better around the house.  This weekend has been interesting.  If you play video games you might know that the much anticipated release of Counter-Strike 1.6 officially took place on Friday.  The Valve network was so bogged down, many people couldn’t download the CS update from the new system called Steam, but they had to download a 379 MB patch to get it to work.  With that all downloaded, all I can say is that CS 1.6 is weird.  Many people complain of the new combat shields you can buy in the game.  One of my buddies said that people could just buy a shield and a Desert Eagle and wait until the person shooting at them ran out of ammo and just run at them and own up.  I can see how that might suck.  There has also been a few updates in maps.  Overall, I think the jury is still out.  CS 1.6 will be alright, I think though.  As far as everything else goes, this weekend was kind of a bummer.  Usually during the weekend I never leave the house.  I was supposed to go and play out at Kirkwood for a Sunday basketball league, but my appendix (?) was hurting.  So I skipped that.  Instead, I watched TV most of the day and ate a bunch of junk food as soon as the pain went away.  I think I hate junk food now.  Cooler Ranch Doritos can go and burn in hell.  Those things leave the worse taste in my mouth.  If I can remember, I think I will stop eating them.  Maybe them and chips in general.  I was reading in a book how “designer fats” were being created like Olean that have less calories.  One of the side effects of Olean, in some cases, is diarrhea.  With that in mind, I don’t think chips are healthy at all.  Although I still do not want to do my homework, I must end my post.  I have nothing else to say.  Night.
