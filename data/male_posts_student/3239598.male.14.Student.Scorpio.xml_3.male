Writewritewritewritewrite!  Oh yea!  Well, we're going to Indy tomorrow.  Joy! The bus ride'll be the best part, though, I kind of wish we could have had co-ed buses.  Oh well, you can't always get what you want, can you?  No, Michael, you can't.  Regardless of what you think.  That's right, go pout now.  Buhhhh bye.  We have that mass thingy at the Cathedral on Wednesday.  Oh, boo.  Upside, we don't have to go to school. At all.  We get lunch catered by Casa's.  I like food.  GIVE ME FOOD!  You know, I think that I could actually go for some more dessert, though I ate like half an apple pie earlier.  I'm gonna be so fat tomorrow... I weigh 136 and that's big enough for me.  I think I'll go on a diet.   I do like this new template, regardless of what anyone else thinks.  It's great, so if you don't like it, I don't care so there!  And, I rhymed.  That NEVER happens.  Arrrgghhh... I have to get up at FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE FREAKING MORNING.  I'm sorry, St. Charlie's, but that is just TOO EARLY FOR ME.  But, I get out of a Tuesday schedule, you say?  Yeah, that lessens the bad, I suppose.  But that is still REALLY REALLY early.  Well, I have to go to bed now, so I will.  I just want to say that I adore going to sleep at night.  Do not ask me, do not question me.  Good night!  ~JACK SPARROW~
