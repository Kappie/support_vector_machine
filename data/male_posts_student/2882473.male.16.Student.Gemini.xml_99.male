Well, I half expected it, I'm not a fast reader, and if he wants to beat me at something, he will generally stay up all night until he has. I read a litle more of book 5 today, and I'm now one chapter from the end, which I will read later today, before probably going back to the good ol' DiscWorld books. I've been thinking about whether I should have a change of book type, as I can't even remember the last book I read that wasn't fantasy or set in the past or future. I suppose Catch 22 would qualify, but that was incredibly dull, and I didn't get much past chapter 8 or so before I moved onto something more... unreal. I may try Lord of the Rings at some point, but the sheer length of them is what's putting me off, and from what I've heard, they are either really dull and long winded, or excellent. I suppose I'll find out for myself at some point.  I had to go into school today, for the meer thrill of handing in text books that I have been using for the past 2 years. I didn't have to go in until 0930, but still, it was totally pointless. We could have handed books in on the first day back. So, I was hanging around in ques, waiting for teachers to acknowledge that the book I was handing in wasn't in pieces, and then after about half an hour, I was free to walk all the way home for the next half hour. And hours journey with half an hour in school. Yep, that was definately worth it. But it did mark the VERY LAST TIME that I have to wear a school uniform. Never again will I be restricted on what to wear, unless I get a sucky job where you have to wear a uniform, but I doubt it. Although we have to look smart next year, ie wear a suit and tie, we still have a little slack. Which reminds me, I really need to go out and buy me a suit or two at some point for next year. Well, I've got plenty of time for that. Right up to the 6th September, where we have 'enrollment day'. What fun that will be.  Anywho, I got home, played on the internet a bit, did the washing up from breakfast, did a bit o' reading, played on the internet a bit more and being bored started todays blog. I wonder if I can get a blog done every day through the summer. Well, it's worth a try I suppose, although it will probably turn out to be really boring after a while. But hey! That's my life, and I'm not forcing anyone to read it. (Please read my blog, I NEED readers...) Yes, I'm just rambling on here, so time for a rapid change of subject me thinks.  The Weather. Yes, that's always worth talking about. It's been mainly sunny cloudy today, moving on to overcast for a bit. And then suddenly, with no warning at all, it started raining very very hard. Which came on incredibly quickly. And then there was lightning, then thunder, which repeated a few times, then it stopped. And now it is back to cloudy. I did however, in the span of about 5 minutes that is lasted, manage to work out the distance the storm was from my house, using the fun fun fun distance = speed x time equation. Turns out I was 2,400 m from the storm. Now isn't that interesting?  That shall be all for today, bye bye all.   Weather:  Now, cloudy. Earlier - storm  Reading:  Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix  Listening to:  Nowt  Watching:  Nowt  Confused about:  Nowt...  Annoyed with:  Having to go to school pointlessly  Mood:  Fairly good
