She told me that she was turning 49 this year and I swear to god she doesn't look it, I thought she was like in her thirties. But yeah I'm being lazy again and I didn't get my ID yet I have to shower and all that good stuff before I do. That's a fun filled day in the life of Alonzo. I guess I'll ttypl ^_^
