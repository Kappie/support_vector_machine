Also couldnt find any statement to tell it to start  YaST 9the SuSe installer) with VESA on the SUSE Support Site.      Then came Knoppix 3.4  : Gosh ! it has improved so much. It's much slicker and much faster than before! And it took exactly 10 minutes  to install on my Celeron 851 MhZ/128 MB Ram  Plus the fact that its based on Debian makes it easier to add more packages. All I need to do is    apt-get install kdegames  and all my games are there ! People say Debian is for advanced users but it's my first experience and I find it much easier   than RPMs.  And the SPEED -  it rocks on Knoppix! My KDE on Fedora was a crawl! Knoppix + KDE is much,  much faster.   BTW, If anyone's looking for Knoppix in India: mail me @ ankitmalik@gmail.com     Check out  urlLink www.knopper.com  for more info.
