Well to begin with im a 17 y/o senior at EHS. I love all aspects of the theatre and my soul is one with the sea when i surf. I am heading to the college of charleston this fall(2004)   Not to sure how i feel today, i got the new Five For Fighting cd (the battle for everything) and though its a great cd it brings up memories of a broken heart(acquired 4 weeks ago and 3 before prom). Very good cd to ponder and listen to the lyrics. I also had a very good talk with a friend about life in general and relationships. One thing ive learned my senior year in high school is to value the moment you live in. I was always looking toward college and i really am going to miss my little home town and the things in it, especially one particualar person that will always hold the first and a special place in my heart(whether she believes it or not)  On another note i think im gonna go rent the last samurai movie i havnt seen it yet and it looks like itd be a good watch
