Mowed Steve Hunsted's lawn across the street, gained 15 bucks. 5. Mowed the lawn of 643 Summit Ave. 6. Picked up the drumset from school, and found that the Redrock Swing Band wasn't done rehearsing yet. We waited for about 10 minutes, then took the set away from them. 7. Tried to mix in dinner sometime. 8. Got the food for the party tommorow night.  That brings me up to now, which is pretty late. I still need to take a shower, pack a lunch, eat a sandwhich because I didn't have any dinner, and go to bed at like 11. Then tommorow I'm going to be absolutely exhausted after everything...
