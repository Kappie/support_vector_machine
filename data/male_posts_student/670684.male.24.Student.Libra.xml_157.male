Hopefully Yahoo!  will allow for CGI scripts in the near future so people can comment, but until then, we can all have a posting orgy.    I want to warn everyone that there will soon be a massive war-based essay on this site, to be followed by little or no mention of the Shodown with Saddam or the War on Terror.  I am vehemently against war, I think you guys know that.  And while the pestilence of our president irritates me, there is little I can say in a paragraph that will make a hoot of difference.  So I will put it all down into an essay, post a link here, and be done with it, except for passing various anti-war article links onto you, my reading brethren.    Those of you tired of my war ramblings, you can thank Barry Bitch Tits and Tommy Tucked In T-shirt for this revelation in my life.  But that story can wait for the essay.
