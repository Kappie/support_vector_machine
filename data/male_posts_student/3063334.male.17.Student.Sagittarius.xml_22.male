Oh yeah, If any of you have trouble finding your latest written post on the web, it's because you did not published it; it's only saved ready to publish. So you have to click on one of the icons on top you'll see that says "publishing", and click on "republish latest". Then you will see your nice happy post on the web.........I'm not sure if there are some remote posts posted by people long long time ago that never got onto the website because somebody didn't publish it...........yeah so be sure to remember to publish everytime you write a post......And enjoy everyone.  wow, what a well constructed argument there Rob.......Now there has commenced a real discussion. Yeah I'll get back to your comments soon on a later post.
