RAMS BEAT THE PACKERS. woot squared. isaac bruce was tearing it up, congrats to him on 10,000 yards. and the niners won too, pretty surprising. owens still has crappy hands. and my stupid fantasy team, thrash got NO YARDS, galloway got NO YARDS, calico got 20 yards. bitch fuckers. i'm still beating alex though, haha. tomlinson busted out today, and domanick davis was pretty crazy too.  oh yea, i want our class t-shirt. it looks so sexy. and i drove today! sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool.
