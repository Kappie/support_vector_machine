Well there were a few things, I suppose:  *First, the crazy Bollywood movie at Spider House.  I still don't know it's name, but I am shocked (shocked I tell you!) at how  freaking long  it turned out to be.  It was basically your typical boy meets girl story, and typically Bollywood, involving an arranged marriage that no one really wanted to take place.  I'm only mentioning this movie because, well, there were some killer song and dance routines.  Otherwise it was terrible.  *More stoner adventures on Friday night: I'm thinking my character under the influence is pretty mellow and pretty quiet, which is nice but somewhat disappointing.  I was hoping to open up more, not get quieter...  *Helping Lena move on Saturday, to an apartment on the 3rd floor...and boy was I sore today.  Then various computer related difficulties surrounding the installation of a new hard drive.  The big news of the past three days?  The opening of the XXVIIIth Olympiad (it's Olympics time again) mean two weeks of thinking "wow where did the last four years go" and "man, why do people like sports so much?".  The outing of New Jersey's gay governor was jaw-droppingly stunning...like  urlLink Jillian , I have mixed feelings about what it means for the future of gay politicians (something I'm pretty interested in).  Most depressingly, California's Supreme Court nullified the marriage licenses of almost 4,000 same-sex couples, meaning that all those happy, loving couples we saw on the news a few months ago are now back to square one--almost, that is.  Issuing those marriage licenses may have been a terrible idea legally (setting gay marriage back in California rather than pushing it forward), but it was a historically significant act of civil disobedience that might have done more for gay and lesbian rights than anything happening in Massachusetts.  Why?  Because what decent American could reasonably find fault with people so obviously in love, and so obviously committed to loving and caring for one another in marriage that they would defy their government, their society, and even their culture to affirm with such boldness the strength of their union?
