It goes like this:  I came across some njcsb (sb is not symphonic band but rather softball) softballer. i shall not reveal the name but basically it's a SHE. i wun describe the degree of good-lookingness but basically ppl who noe me shd that i have some taste. From which house i wun say, but surely it must be something so closely (or rather directly) related to mine. Okay, that's all. other information eg complexion shd not be told lest the softballers in our class would start guessing who the hell i'm refering to ( well, surely manda elsa and nana muz be guessing, if not, already got the idea who i might be toking about)   jus in case THAT softballer i'm toking about happens to read this. I HAVE NO OFFENCE. I WAS JUST A DREAM WHICH I ALSO FIND UNBELIEVABLE.
