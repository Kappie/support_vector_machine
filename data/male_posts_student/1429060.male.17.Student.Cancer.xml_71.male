I won't say why over blogger, lest she desire that the reason be kept silent, but I know that a multitude of people are unhappy as a result of this. I mean, truly, her blog was somewhat of a column that a lot of other blogs seem to rotate about. Hers and DOY, perhaps. It's the whole breach of confidence and trust and interaction that disturbs me about the whole matter. I'm sorry, dear Alanna.  Bloody english rough drafts are due next week. I am doomed.  Oh, by the way, an interesting new link to your right. Apparently, people usually follow a behavioral sinosoidial curve (that means like a sine graph) that adheres to three human categories: emotional, physical, and intellectual. These occur in periods of 23 to 33 days. The lines are thus known as  urlLink biorhythms .  Evening, mortals.
