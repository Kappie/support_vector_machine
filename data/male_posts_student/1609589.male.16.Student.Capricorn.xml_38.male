Or get a bunch of people to go see a movie. Or SOMETHING!!! and invite me. COME ONNN!!!! please?  I guess that sums up what 2 days of isolation can do to a guy. I can't have anyone over cuz there's nothing to do, I can't go anywhere because I'm broke, and most the people i want to talk to on AIM are either always away or gone! What is a suffering athiest to do!?!?!  Current Mood: Unhappily stressed!!! ((>  Current music: Under My Feet by Celldweller
