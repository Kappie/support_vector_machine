I can't believe I wasn't able to write it.  I wonder... Will i ever change. will i ever be the kind of person that i should be? who is that person....  I'm drifting away from myself. or maybe going towards myself more. either i think its bad... i dont have that many thoughts today. im depressed... urgh!
