Granted, sometimes we are put in a situation where we are forced to fight in a war (and sometimes we are in a situation where we do not have to), but I believe that, as brothers and sisters in Christ, the only war we are called to fight together is the war on war itself.  Pope Paul VI:  "No more war! Never again war! If you wish to be brothers, drop your weapons."  "No more war, war never again!  Peace, it is  peace which must guide the destinies of people and of all mankind."
