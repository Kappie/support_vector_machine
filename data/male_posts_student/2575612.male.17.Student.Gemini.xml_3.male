       
      The questions run so deep, When its two in the morning I should be lost in sleep But in my mind i am sorting All the things that I cant explain Why so many suffer in pain? Wheres the answer?   I hide behind a smile  But in my heart i am bleeding I can sometimes read the crowd And relate to their feelings never knowing what tomorrow brings And trying so hard to just believe in something  Falling down around me is a world So incomplete It makes no sense to me How can i compete? Except to know the mercy and the comfort That you bring Inspite of me Oh its a mystery  And when i cannot see You keep my feet from falling You hold me in your peace Here in the grand scheme  We can only know in part When we're this side of heven So i'm trusting in my heart For one final amen A day when all the wrong will be made right That's all i really need to rest inside, tonight
