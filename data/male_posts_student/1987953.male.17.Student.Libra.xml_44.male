I took a look at Karen's car (Karen Bertsche, my very very good friend, my penpal from Summit Grove Camp) that she told me she had, and it's not too bad. It's a white Oldsmobile Achieva SL. I imagine it's similar to  urlLink this . It's pretty cool, actually. If I found a good deal on one, I'd buy it. Just not white. I hate white on a car.  Who has their own car? If you have a car, what kind is it? If possible, go to  urlLink Auto Trader  and find a similar type with a picture. Otherwise, what is your dream car? You can go to  urlLink Auto Trader  and find a link for that too. By the way, so the comment is smaller, if you insert a link, insert it this way:  [PLACE TEXT YOU WANT AS A HYPERLINK FOR YOUR LINK HERE] . Take out the + signs in between the carrot signs. I only put them there so they would show up on my blog. When the + signs are out, it is HTML language. Sorry to be such a pain, but a lot of people hate long comments, so it makes it look more neat and concise. If you have trouble, post the regular URL and I will go behind you on my comments (I can edit my comments) and make it the way it should be. So don't stress over it. Just make a note at the end to alter it for you. Also, sorry about the consistant car thing, but until I definately have my own car, that is all I can think about. You know how it is. If you have trouble putting up with it, comment and tell me to write about something different. (Also, I am still taking suggestions for driving songs... see the December 5th blog for more info about that.)   Anyway, blog ya later! Comment me! (Remember... me sad!)  In Christ, Mike >
