I don't know how to act around her. Sometimes I feel like she wants to get back together with me and that she misses me. Other times, she yells at me and gets mad at me very quickly. Also, I sit around thinking that I really really want to be with her and how much I miss her. I don't know if this means that I truly am in love with her or if I am just lonely. I know that I am really really really lonely. I feel lost right now. For five years, I always had Megan to hang out with and now I don't. It is just a real shock because I don't have anyone to talk to or hang out with. Oh well, we will see how camping goes this weekend.
