I had a dream last night about an evil corporation trying to poison specific genetic groups all around the planet - almost some sort of final solutionesque plan to kill everyone except a chosen few. My friends were involved in this plan - apparently involving a binary poison called 1666 (named thusly for the Great Fire of London - the picture accompanying it depicted a 17th century disaster). The stages are called 1667 and 1668. I managed to destroy one of these stations for mixing the binary liquid before I woke - however I spilled some on myself - who knows, maybe I was destined for a horrid dream death.
