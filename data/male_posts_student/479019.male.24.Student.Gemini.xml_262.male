Following the party, we all went to the Belmar and drank some more. I ended up crashing at Zeynep and Gamze's place. Friday, I was only home for a short nap in the late afternoon, as I went directly to campus from their place. Later that night, Jeff, Gamze and I went to watch  Jackass: the Movie  and had some drinks at the Ale House. So it's been a really busy past few days.   ***
