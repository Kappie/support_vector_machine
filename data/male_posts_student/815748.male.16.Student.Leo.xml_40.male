I'm conflicted, whether I should be stressed or not, since, on the one hand, I don't really think they'll be that hard, but on the other hand, there's a lot of preparing to do that I've been procrastinating about.  Today I took the first part of my finals, a French composition.  It wasn't too bad, save for that at the beginning, I was more nervous than I have been in a long time.  Well, since I just finished the movies I got at Blockbuster and the library ("The Mark of Zorro," "The Road to Perdition," "The Man in the Iron Mask," "Changing Lanes," and "Waking Life," all pretty gouda), I might start doing what I be needing to do.  By the way, since you would normally say "I do not ask," instead of "I ask not," shouldn't you say "I do not be," instead of "I am not..."?  Something I just learned from "Waking Life": to test whether or not you're dreaming, see if you can read numbers and small print, and try changing the light levels by flicking a light switch.  If the first is illegible, and if the second is impossible, you're probably asleep.  For more cool philosophical stuff, I would highly recommend "Waking Life."  In closing, here is this part of Steve Martin's "A Wild and Crazy Guy,":  Last summer, I had a few days off, so I decided to go to Paris.  I figured, I don't speak a word of French, English is an international language, no problem, it'll be easy.  The first indication I have trouble, I get off the plane, step into a taxi, say to the driver, "I would like to go to a hotel, please,"  Driver turns to me and goes, "Jeune te suis, les de deux de toi?!"  "What?! What is that you're saying? Hahahahaha."  So, the first thing you do, this is really dumb, you adopt a French accent.  "Ah would lak to go to ze otel."  So that's nothing, so I got a little French phrasebook, hoping to memorize little phrases, like "Where is the bathroom?"  But French is not like Spanish, Spanish is easy for Americans, you can sound it out, you just go, "Casa dey peypey.  Dundey esta, casa dey peypey?"  But French is like, "June de les troighgh.  Jutune noighghgh"  "Come quickly, doctor!"  "What happened, what happened?"  "He spoke French!  Help him."  So anyway, all I could remember was chesse omelette: "omelette du fromage."  I'd be practicing saying it all the time, "omelette du fromage."  Go up to people on the street, "Hey, omelette du fromage!"  So I go into a restaurant, waiter comes up to me, and I say "Omelette du fromage."  Except then, the waiter thinks you speak French, he says, "Jeune te suis, les de deux de toi?!"  And I go, "Yes!"  And he brings you a shoe with cheese on it... and you also told him to stuff it down your throat.  "I'll have a shoe with cheese on it, stuff it down my throat, and I want to massage your grandmother, alright?"
