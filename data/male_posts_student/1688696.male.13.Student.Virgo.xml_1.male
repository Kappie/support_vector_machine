Alyssa called me and that woke me up (better than the radio) and I kind of just wanderedaround the house.        ThenI realized...there was no one else home. KICKASS! Yeah so I told Alyssa I'd call her back and put Blink on really loud on my big and kinda crappy stereo. Showered, contacts in, the whole deal. Yeah I expected my mom to be home, but eh, nope. Sister was at summer stage camp at the time, dad was at work, and my mom, well she was just not there. I called her cell to see where she was cause it was like 12:00 and she should have been home. She left it at home.        Next, I called Alyssa back, talked a bit, then she had to go shower or something so she said she'd call me back. So yeah I ordered Papa Johns for lunch. Creepy delivery guy. Anyway so I yeah skipping forward a to avoid boredom.        At Alyssa's. Alex is there, who is indeed..kickass because she is. We went outside to play cops and robbers but it was basically manhunt. Me and Alex got bored because we didn't know anybody but I did meet this really cool person Katie (Fergy).        Back at Alyssa's house. Me, Alyssa, and Alex started watching the ring and then Katie joined us. Uhh yeah so we watched I love the 90s and stuff... well anyway stayed there until 11 and now I'm home alone...miss her..later
