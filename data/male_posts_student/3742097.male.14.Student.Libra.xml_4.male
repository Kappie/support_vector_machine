Well today I am really bored waiting for the Yankee/Mets game (at 7) that I am going to talk about this article. Well now that I read the whole article I will talk about something else, the top 5 searches by google. Ah google, the page that comes up when I open up a new Internet Explorer Window.  The top 5 searches are: 5.Canoe Trips 4.Soy Supplements 3.Sassy Sleepware 2.MP3 Downloads 1.Celerbrity Diets.  Is this canoe season? How does Canoe Trips end up as a Top 5 thing that is searched? Did everyone suddenly get a little Lewis and Clark in their minds? Does everyone now was to go where no man has gone before? Into the bold unknown? The only place I am going is in my room when my mom finds out I haven't cleaned it yet.  Soy Supplements?!?! I am looking at the Nutrition Facts for Soy and I see nothing wrong with Soy. But whatever, I probably have my facts wrong.  Sassy Sleepware. Don't get me wrong, I am all for chicks looking hot and it is even better when the are showing some skin in sleepware. But who says the word sassy? The last time I heard the word sassy was on a McDonalds commercial when they said that additional toys were available for children under the age of 3. And the toys were all in a line of toys named Sassy.  MP3 Downloads is understandable, no one wants to pay ridiculous amounts of money for CD's with 12 Tracks. I have paid $20 for some CD's, $1.67 per track. I may have some money, but that is a little much for music. Pssssst if you download go  urlLink here  and download Protowall. Then go  urlLink here  to learn how to install Protowall. It isn't a simple double click on the install button and hit OK a few times. Oh contrair montrair.  And finally Celebrity Diets. Again this is understandable. People are all wanting to look like their favorite clelebrity and such. Even I have given thought to buying Creatine, which is much like a steroid. And the idea isn't totally shot down, but it isn't looking too likely to happen. But it is ironic, most people want to lose weight where I want to gain weight. And you would think with the obesity percentage in this country I would be succeding in my plan to gain weight. Nope, last time I checked I lost 4 pounds, and I am down to 136.  I have successfully written paragraphs about worthless dribble, I think it turned out pretty well. Tonight I have lots of nothing planed, but they Yankee Game is on at 7. And tonight I can't watch my show at 2AM. :( Because I have to get up at 6 tomorrow. Oh well I do have the whole summer. And tomorrow I will be at the Yankee Stadium. And I will be with someone who I wouldn't think for a second of not bringing. Have fun everyone while I get jumped in the Bronx, I'll bring you back a souvenir.
