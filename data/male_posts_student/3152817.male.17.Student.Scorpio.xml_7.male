First of all, our class must not have know what Chaplin meant when they voted for it.  It was down to 2 choices, 1. the preachers daughter (literally) or 2. the porn star (not much of a star, but in a porn film none the less).  Since the Chaplin is the religious leader of our class, wouldn't the obvious choice be the preachers daughter?, the girl who's nice to anyone she talks to.  Apparently not for our class.  We elected a girl who made a movie of herself and ex-boyfriend having sex, a girl who can't make it through a day w/ out insulting someone to their face.  And then we have her hypocrisy.  She preaches to me about how I shouldn't talk about people behind their back.  Maybe she should practice what she preaches.  It's not setting a very good "moral" example when the "religious leader" of our class, sits in first period and talks about people who aren't in the room.  If you have something to say to me say it to my face.  I have no problem posting my opinion for all to see.  I don't keep what I think away from you.  If you've got a problem w/ me, take it up w/ me, not everyone in first period.  And this gets even better...  Apparently our class Chaplin was "led by God" to run for the office.  I ask, did God lead her to turn on the video camera as well?  Let me say that I would have voted for this girl for any office she ran for except Chaplin.  She will make a great class officer because she can handle the work.  Chaplin is another story though.  It should not be such a morally disillusioned person, it should be a person of good moral character, a person that hasn't exploited herself on video tape.  If I've offended anyone else in the past few days w/ comments about this, I sincerely apologize.  It was not my intention to group all the officers for next year in w/ the Chaplin.  If you do choose to group yourself w/ this person still, maybe you should really think about it, read the main part of this post again, and if you still feel that the right person was elected, well, then you must be a democrat.
