The general public seems uninterested and unimaginative when it comes to the benefits of a strong exploration program.  It is a shame that we are losing our ability to dream of grander things.  Quote -   "You can't have a war, cut taxes, have the economy in a garbage pail and spend billions going into space," said Dallas Hodgins, a 76-year-old retired University of Michigan researcher from Flint, Mich. "How are they going to pay for all this? I don't see how it's morally justifiable. In Flint, there isn't a school roof that doesn't leak."   End quote.  So we dare not dream of anything more grand than fixing a school roof?  It's a shame that we are squandering that which makes us a great nation - the desire to shape the world to our will, not to defend what we have against the relentless march of entropy.
