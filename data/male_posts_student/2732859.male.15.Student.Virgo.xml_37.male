The votes from the key swing state of Ohio pushed him over the top to the nomination. His running made, Senator John Edwards, earlier delivered an excellent speech to the convention and the nation by saying, "Hope is on the way!" It was a great speech and now we wait for Senator Kerry to deliver his acceptance speech in a little less than 24 hours from now.
