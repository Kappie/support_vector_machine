Well guys, I've been to the Casino today (again); made some money, just 'bout enough to spend it on a few drinks with my best friend. We had one of those "love hurts and life's a bitch" conversations, but I'm guessin' everything turned out oK in the end. :) He's having some "problems" with his (ex?)g/f, and he knows I'm always the one person he can turn to... and so he did... and so we talked for a couple of hours... and we are now so tired... :( Well anyway, I just hope everything turns out oK for them; it would be a shame to let all hope wander off in such an early relationship development.  You must be wondering why I brought all this up... "is he frustrated, having problems with his own love-life...?". I'll give you a straight answer -  NO ... ;) I'm happily in-love and intend to keep it that way! With this said, I'm sending a whole bunch of kisses to my sweety :***...  oH, and btw., don't blame me for typing all of this, I tend to get lonely in the mornin'... ;)  Have fun now!
