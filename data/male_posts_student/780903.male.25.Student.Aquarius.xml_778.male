There is no reason for this post, but just in case you're curious.  I didn't think I'd seen this many until I made the list, although I guess 18 movies in a year really isn't a crazy amount, especially since I think I saw 5 movies in 2 weeks at one point this summer.  I generally try to only go to movies I think I'll like (so my choices probably say as much about me as my rankings), but I would say I only liked the top 11 of the 18, and #10 and #11 are borderline.  1. Spellbound 2. Shattered Glass 3. Bend It Like Beckham 4. Elf 5. School of Rock 6. A Mighty Wind 7. American Wedding 8. Camp 9. Johnny English 10. Seabiscuit 11. Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star  12. American Splendor 13. Bruce Almighty 14. Intolerable Cruelty 15. Thirteen 16. Legally Blonde 2 17. Better Luck Tomorrow 18. The Matrix Revolutions  Heck, just because I'm curious how many movies I saw last year, while I'm at it, this would be my list for movies released in 2002:  1. Antwone Fisher 2. About a Boy 3. The Emperor's Club 4. Moonlight Mile 5. Spider-Man 6. The Rookie 7. Undercover Brother 8. Bowling for Columbine 9. Mr. Deeds 10. Hollywood Ending 11. John Q 12. 40 Days and 40 Nights 13. Kissing Jessica Stein 14. Sweet Home Alabama 15. About Schmidt 16. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 17. The Good Girl 18. Two Weeks Notice 19. Orange County 20. Tadpole 21. Igby Goes Down 22. Roger Dodger 23. Chicago  I'd draw my Like/Didn't Like line right below #16 I guess, although #13-#16 could probably just as easily be on the other side of the line.
