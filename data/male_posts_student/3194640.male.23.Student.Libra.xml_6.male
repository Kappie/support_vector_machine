For once,  urlLink CNN  and  urlLink Fox News  agree on something. I'm not sure if I want to watch it just yet. I think this one might be a renter.  Ever had a "case of the Mondays" on a Friday? That's what I have today (and it sucks). I'm looking forward to making a trip to  urlLink Best Buy  after work to make some purchases. Haven't decided yet if I want to buy  urlLink  The Office   on DVD or the new  urlLink Cardigans  CD,  urlLink  Long Gone Before Daylight  . I'm really torn, but what do you care? Yeah, that's what I thought.  Word.
