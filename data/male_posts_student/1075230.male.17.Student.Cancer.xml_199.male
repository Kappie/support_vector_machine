BC - 2 win 1 loss   my betting line: BC wins by 6   come down to the gym at lunch to see my team get slaughtered ^^     Nunavut team record: 1-2-0 B.C. team record: 3-1-0   Game notes: my betting line was pretty close... instead of winning by 6, BC won by 5. Star player today, IMO, would be Francross, who did some amazing goaltending. In 3-ball, 6 points is  very  little. To my credit, people said that i did a good job too. I guess i can be satisfied... BC had won 20-17 in a gruelling match against a gr.12 Phys.Ed team.   Chris and Derek team were against Jeff's team... Jeff (sue ping)'s team won 16-5...    joe, josh, sheryl, jacky, and i think, crystal and tracy came to watch... so that's cool...   overall, i hope that BC wins the intramural tournament... they've been "scouting" everyday, and it's the only team in which almost the entire team are friends. They're also pretty skilled, needless to say... their 3-1-0 record speaks for themselves. BC overcame odds in a stronger gr.12 team by playing more intelligently. All they need to do is overcome Conor's team and Emer's team. Right now, BC is 2nd overall.   Ahh... busted up my knees and ankles today ^^;; the gym floor is hard   will post the other two events later   ~Chronos
