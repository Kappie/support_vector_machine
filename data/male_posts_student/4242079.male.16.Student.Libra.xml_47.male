Supper went well, as did the massage and time following supper. She really looked beautiful. Hopefully her gift will arrive in the mail sometime next week.   My parents come home today. This makes me sad. I am going to the Kiros/Deville/Sewing With Nancie show tonight in Calgary, and we wanted to leave early to go shopping, but no....I have to wait until they fucking get home. We'll probably have an hour tops to shop before everything closes. They're not even here and they find a way to ruin a perfectly good day. Fuch You.  Meh. Crystal, since you're not responding to my messages, call me.
