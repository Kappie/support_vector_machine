SO i think the saxes are the kings of partying and slacking off during marching band. Unfortunately last year we didnt keep up the streak for longest time without "section of the week" which was cool but wasnt cool because now everyone is starting to look at us more as workers than slackers. We lost some of the best saxes last year (mikey, steve, and max) and those guys taught us how to slack off even though they didnt tell us, we just watched them. Oh well so yeah go saxes and YES I CAN WAIT FOR THE THING ON SATURDAY.  Ok now back to eric morrisons party. It was actually pretty good since the number of girls increased dramatically and according to tyler, kurtis, and I, we decided there were 3 girls that we hot out of the bunch. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!!! so yeah it was very loud because of some girls going crazy during a cranium game so me, tyler, and kurtis went upstairs and watched The End of Evengalism (i think). My first anime that i have seen and it was pretty good. So we need to watch another one guys!!!!!  Ok guys i hope u find morrison to be pretty cool and the saxes to be lazier than expected and with that said peace out and have a good one!
