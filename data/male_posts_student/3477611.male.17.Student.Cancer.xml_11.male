But wait, don’t you look down now, Cause it’s breaking on the ground.  So tell me… What does one guy have to do To be with you? Should I beg? Should I crawl? Would it even help at all If I let you have it all?  Breaking down that wall around you It has been there for too long. It’s time to let your self be free Come on! Come on! It’s something we can find. There is more to life Than these damn deceptions and lies. Please tell me what I can do To just show you?  So tell me… What does one guy have to do To be with you? Should I beg? Should I crawl? Would it even help at all If I let you have it all?  Please!…Oh Please!!!…Let Me into your heart…Let Me in and we could start To understand your mysteries. I’m beginning to see Why it’s not me What do I have to do To make it up to you? So can I ask you…  Please!!!…Tell me… What does one guy have to do To be with you? Should I beg? Should I crawl? Would it even help at all If I let you have it all?  If I gave you all of me Nothing left for me to see But dependency Lying directly on you. Would you take it And keep it safe? Or would crush me? Could I interest you In another casualty?  What do I have to do To prove it to you? Prove that I’m the one All that other shit is Better left undone. Don’t fuckin’ tear my heart! I’m tired and weary. Keep on pushing And you’re bound to see A side of me that’s better left unseen.  What does one guy have to do To be with you? Should I beg? Should I crawl? Would it even help at all If I let you have it all? NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    here ends the love making session
