He convinced me (lots of arm twisting there...) to head down with him and Roo to Foxwoods to meet up with Mark Manley after the show.  Met Mark down there, watched Roo, Mark, and Wrobs kick serious blackjack booty.  We headed back to Boston, and crashed at Roo's place.  Saturday, got up and Mark and I headed back to my apt, where my roommate Dawn was busy moving out (anyone need a phat beachfront apt in the metro Boston area).  Wrobs came over, picked us up, and we went to Suffolk Downs to watch a little horse racing (most importantly the Kentucky Derby).  Then we met Greg Binz, John Clark, Dana Semmell, and Christy and Irene from Six Appeal at Vinny Testa's on Beacon.  We all had a great dinner and headed to Bonk's for a little get-together.  Vic showed up there, along with Matty Lane, Ed Boyer, and a whole bunch of BC Acoustics and Bostonians.  Great night, definitely.  Saw Kaitlyn again... wasn't sure I'd ever see her... turns out her comp was stolen (that's what I get for not using my phone).  Heh.  Night ended, Mark and I crashed at Roo's.  Got up this morning, had breakfast at Tufts with Greg, Mark, Ed, and Mike Flynn and spent most of the rest of today driving around between John Clark's place and Tufts.  That brings us to now.  Mallory, thank you.  Be in touch.  Everything's cool.  Mom and Dad, you're amazing.  I'll charge my phone and talk to you tonight.  Mary, you're in my thoughts every minute.  I hope you're safe and happy.  20 days.  The disc is incredible.  J
