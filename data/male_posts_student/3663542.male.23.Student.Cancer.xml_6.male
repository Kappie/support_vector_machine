So after I showered today I was talking to my mom about my academic penalties that apparently I was under for 5 min today, and as I sometimes do when avoiding unpleasant conversations I started to mess with my hair, and I realized I didn't rinse out the conditioner. Man I hate when I do that; means I have to get wet again, at least partially (witch is worse than totally) and dry off again, and that's really annoying. Unfortunately for me since I started using conditioner I have done this quite often. See for most of my life I didn't use conditioner, thought it would make my hair too, something... But one day when I was having my hair cut the girl convinced me to start using conditioner, so I started. I kinda like it what it dose. Speaking of hair though I really need it cut, its beginning to really annoy me.  Humm... I thought I had 3 things I was going to talk about, but I can only remember two of them... I did the one, and now I don't really want to go into the other, but the short version is: G4techtv is gay, really gay. I was really into this one anime they were showing and the stopped it 1/2 way though the series, to show other gay one... This is not the only thing but its the last straw, I used to really like Tech TV, then they merged with G4 a gaming channel, and it all went to pot. All the G4 shows are sophomoric, you have to be a moron to watch them... Any way this really annoyed me, and I was going to rant and rave about it, but I don't feel like going into it deeper than this at this point.  I got a comment from someone I don't know on this thing. I thought it was awesome... his name was demitri, a greek name, so I went to his blog to find out more, and his is in spanish, and he's from mexico, so demitri if you read this thankx! I figure he came accrost this by searching for similar interests, b/c he had capoiera as a interest also...  I spend way too much time on  urlLink homestarrunner.com , they should make a homestarrunner trivia game somewhere, that would be awesome, I could hold my own at it. I come to this conclusion when my sister holly asks if homestar has a house and I tell her what Strongbad  urlLink e-mail  to go to (by name), where they are in H*Rs house. ah well, there are worse sites that I could spend time on, like g4techtv.com, man since the merger they cant even put together a decent site... its never updated, no content, ('cept if you are looking for a cheat code). so gay sorry I regressed there.  Speaking of H*R I decided that it was time to change what my start button has on it. It did say "Ben's Computer" but I only did that to show my dad how I changed it, but it kinda stuck for a while. any way I have now changed my button to say "eh Steve!" it works for now.  oh yeah I really don't like AOL, I was on earlier and for the second time this summer I was kicked offline because apparently I signed on somewhere else. The last time this happened I changed my password immediately. Tonight however I let it slide, and figured it was a fluke, but about 8 min later it happened again. This time I changed my password and it hasn't happened since. So I'm guessing that AOL's passwords aren't that hard to get past, so I started to figget with it and found that passwords on AOL can only be 8 charitors long, (the password I thought I was using was 9 charitors) any way just more for me to complain about about AOL. Cant waite till I get back to broadband...  I should go to bed, even though I don't have work tomorrow... its my last week of work and I only work 3 days! anyway I don't work tomorrow, I really should try to do something in that time, but it seems like so much effort. so ill probably sit at home and complain on this thing about something... OH!!!! I remembers the other thing, I think I found my problem with kicking a football (soccer ball) tonight. For some stupid reason when I kick with any power the ball will shank off to the right most of the time. Also I was noticing the other day my big toe on my right foot hurt. Well tonight I put 2 with 3 and got 8, saw that wasn't right took away 4 from the answer and got 4, figured that was close enough and turned in my paper. I found that I raise my big toe up when I kick, so its getting messed up, and is providing a uneven surface for the ball, forcing it right. So I taped my big toe to the one next to it and it made a huge improvement. the ball went straighter, harder, and I had more control. Now this may only be a "feather" (think dumbo) but for now it works for me, er it did, ill try it again tomorrow.  I love my dog and all, but right now he stinks. Yeah I'm sure sometimes I stink too, but he likes it, I try to wash when I start to stink. He finds stink and will roll in it. At least he's not one of those annoying dogs that always wants attention.  la la la dum de dum... Oh I finale got my Berimbau strung tight enough so that it sounds right, now if I could only play it correctly for more than one iteration. Speaking of Capoeira, I'm so gonna get beet down when I go back to the club, man I should practice more, but its so hard to want to do without a partner.  well its late, er, its early, so sleep yes
