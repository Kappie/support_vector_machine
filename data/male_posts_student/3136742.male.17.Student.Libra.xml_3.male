I started reading  The Old Man and the Sea  the other day. At first I though "this is stupid. Why does Hemmingway get so much credit?"... Then I read more and realized this is one goddamned incredible book... I'm gonna finish it now.   check out those FOIA (Freedom of Information Act-for those of you not  "in the know" ) documents folks
