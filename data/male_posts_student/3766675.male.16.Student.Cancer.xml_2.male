I've always got a lot of things to say..and not a lot of ways to say them. Hmm. Let's start with an obvious. Life is so confusing. Don't you ever wonder if someone had told you life was this difficult that you would have gave up trying SO hard long ago? I don't mean give up completely, I mean just stop trying to impress everyone. Sure, our parents gave us this advice and they're always right. *Rolls Eyes Til They Get Stuck* If our parents were SO right about everything, they should be psychics. But, they're not. Well, maybe some of them are, but you know... And as if it's not bad enough with parents, you've got just regular everyday people making your life worse. Then you've got your WONDERFUL friends. I can honestly say, I've never had any better friends than I have right now. These people are so permanent and really care about what I'm saying and me. It's so cool when you don't have to ask a friend if they care, because you already know. You can feel it. I always have fun when I'm with my friends...I use to always feel like the outcast. The guy who had nothing to say. The guy who was afraid to speak up. Now you can't get me to shut up! But...just some thoughts for now. I didn't really know where this was getting me, but I got somewhere. Or maybe I didn't? I just rambled on about how life sucks, but what else is a guy like me supposed to do?  ~Love, Peace,  All Good Things~ SiLaS
