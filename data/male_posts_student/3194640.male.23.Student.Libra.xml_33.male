I went to my short story class yesterday. It was pretty cool. The class gets to choose its own short stories to read. I have to pick 2. I haven't decided what we'll read yet. I need to find something cool. I'm looking forward to tomorrow's class, because we'll be watching Tim Burton's  Big Fish .  I read the assignment for my ethics class today: I have no idea what I read. I didn't understand any of it. Hopefully the teacher will be able to interpret it. From what I hear, our professor hates the book, so his interpretation should be interesting.  Word.
