It is rather complex and boring to have to type all that stuff out on it's own page everyday. This way all I need to do is log in and type up today's summary. Ah, life can be so simple at times. It's almost 5:00 AM, and I am so awake it's sick. I broke my damn chair in my room so I had to drag it out in two pieces, which was wonderful. I had a hell of a time getting the leather recliner in here to replace it; but it was worth it. It is ever so comfy sitting in here now!  So if you are just "surfing" into the journal, you should check out my actual website which can give you more insight as to who I am and what not.  urlLink Check It Out!   Well, a quarter of this new day has past. I need to get to sleep. But I can't at the moment, so I'll just rant for a bit. Sound good?   I just finished a cigarette, perhaps that will calm my nerves down and help me to sleep, in a bit that is.   Work was busy as hell tonight, we had so many people waiting to get thru the lines, and all it was were people bitching all damn night. I wanted to kill half of them. But whatever, I am paid to listen to it, so I suppose it's "all good".  I am looking forward to my holidays that start July 14th. I get a whole 2 weeks off while we move houses. It will be a nice break, except for the packing part. I suck at packing, I mean, I can't even pack for a trip. It's horrible I know.   Ah well, life isn't always fair, is it?  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site    I am going to head to bed now though, I will try to sleep my awakeness off. Bye guys!
