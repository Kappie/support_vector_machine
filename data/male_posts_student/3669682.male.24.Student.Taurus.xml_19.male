If you have the opportunity to see them live, I strongly suggest you show up. They don't charge much (by big-ticket-band standards) and put on what is most certainly one of my top-3 shows ever. (The other two, if you're interested, are Pink Floyd's 1994 'Division Bell' tour, and Cowboys Fringants' Bell Center show.)   New single = new album = new tour. I'm giddy already.
