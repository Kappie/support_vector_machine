Erik  Dad's little camping trip got cancelled so they're gonna be home... so much for some nice quiet time.  i am VERY disappointed.  but whatever.  im not really in the best of moods.  man i wish their thing hadnt been cancelled.  that sounds terrible i know.  but i really need some time where this no NOISE!  and they are the main people that cause noise and just get on my nerves!  yeah.  well the past 2 days have just flown by.  i really cant even remember what has gone on.  i am so upset with where i am in life at the moment its not even funny.  i never thought i'd feel this way again.  i thought i was stronger since the last time.  just goes to show you how weak people really are.  i am a perfect example.  torn apart by emotions, rebuilt by logic, and now destroyed again by passion.  its amazing how the mind works.  how your feelings can affect you so greatly.  ha... whats really amazing is how powerless i feel when it comes to my emotions.  blah.  ya anyways.  im spilling too much.  we shall save the rest for another time.  for now its out to eat.  au revoir...
