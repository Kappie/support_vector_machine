I wouldn't call it fun per se, but it's similar to meditating in that it really makes you feel good after you're done. I've been getting back into my running routine these past few months and I think I may have lost some weight. I've never been a part of a running club, but I think I'd like to try to take part in some local running events. ["Mayberry," Rascal Flatts, 2002]  I've never run more than 6 miles at a time, which is almost 10km I think, but I can currently do two miles in 15 minutes, not speedy but decent for me I think.  Ok, I think this 10 commandments in the courthouse thing is getting a bit out of hand. The same sort of thing happened 4 years ago in South Carolina with the Confederate flag controversy. ["Brain Stew," Green Day, 1995] Just because one single judge wants his favorite statue in a federal building doesn't mean he can dismiss the seperation between church and state. However, people too quickly forget that one year ago we were all bitching about the "under God" part in the pledge of allegience. How can one justify keeping the ten commandments sculpture and yet keeping the pledge of allegiance untouched? ["The Cinema Show," Genesis, 1973]  I have a lot of opinions on this, but basically I know that the founding of our country was intertwined tightly with religion and that the two, though now seperate, have a common heritage. Rejecting this fact is rejecting history, which is just goddamn foolish. We shouldn't have to get rid of all religious icons in politics, but we should be aware of  how  these things are being presented (without alternative religions displayed, without appropriate plaques describing the historical significance, etc). Whatever, Alabama's whack.  I'm finding that a sense of community will probably be really strong here at TCOM. ["The Power of Goodbye," Madonna, 1998]  Our class of about 120 people will surely become a really closely knit group. With White Coat ceremony approaching I think we all realize that we're all in this together. Some of it may be that we're a much more mature group (average age 25). I remember feeling the same kind of comaraderie when I was at TAMS ('97-'99), but I never felt that same bond at Duke, maybe between me and certain other individuals, but never as a part of a group. ["Sweet Afton," Nickel Creek, 2002]  I guess I can't really say that. I remember living in the Arts Dorm and most of us in there really supported each other in a very sincere way. This was an exception. Duke was a wonderful place, but I will not be remembering it for its sense of community. ["Putting the Damage On," Tori Amos, 1996]  I really look forward to the possibilities here in this new place.   My apartment is a wreck and I've got to clean it and study more cell crap. Later.  Song of the day: "Minerva,"  Deftones, 2003
