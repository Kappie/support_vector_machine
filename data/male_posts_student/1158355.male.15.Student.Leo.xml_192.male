People were throwing pieces of paper at this gay floutist and the sub thought it was Schreck so now he's getting 2 days detention. But I was a witness and he's gonna have his parents call up. Damn school. I'm sick of adults trying to tell us what to do and how to run our lives. All these fucking punishments and all, and some are after school. They expect us to stay after, after we spent 6 hours in school and just because they feel bitchy. If I ever got in trouble, and had like detention after school or anything, I wouldn't go. Because think about it, they can't force you into coming. You just go home. Next day they ask you why you didn't come. You say because after 1:52 or whatever, every weekday during the school year, you are not in control of me, in fact you're never in control of me. Then they suspend you and you get to stay home! Ha! See punishments are bliss. See that's how I love my life so much. I do what I want to do and I'm not going to let others, no matter how old, tell me what to do. That's why my life isn't a suicidal whore house. Believe it or not much of suicide is caused by adults. And what's with New York being such a hard education, ease off us. I just pity the ones who allow adults to tell them what to do. The only people that can tell you what to do are your parents and the cops, and your parents are only a guide. Listen to them. They're smarter then you think. They've been through life already. Take their advice and hopefully make good use of it. As for the po-po, respect them and try your hardest to avoid conflict with them. But also do remember, they are no more powerful than you. We are all equal, none being superior and inferior in this world, and cops are just like us so don't let them shove you around for no reason. If a cop demands something from you, you have the right to question, to know why he demands. My dad's a cop. His cop parties are insane. They get waisted and pass out and they run around the block with only underwear on, yea talk about ironic. Like I said, they are us, we are them, so don't think just because they're cops, they're here to make examples out of you. But also respect them. What the hell am I talking about anyways, all of these morals, am I high on crack? My point is there is by chance, only one life you live, have the best of it, don't get shoved around, seek the truth, question authority. That's my moral of life. OK, I'm done for the day. Good Bye. Wait, it's me again only it's 8 at night now. You know what kicks ass? Making a movie with Dan and Pat for a school project where Pat is filmed jerking off but they only show the shoulders up and I'm recorded with a =-O disgusted face. Then Pat eases back and I throw milk on him so it looks like ya know. Then Dan records it the controller and the glass of milk, he was playing a video game, not jerking off! Just did that today, lots of fun. My bathroom is also almost done. All it needs is the lights, the mirror casing, the side wall painted and the shower door. Up, Mark the bathroom guy is here again so I gotta let him in and then continue with my drumming.
