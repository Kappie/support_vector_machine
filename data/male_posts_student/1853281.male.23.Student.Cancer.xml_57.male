I don't quite have to begin preparing for my  urlLink Fabulous New Years Party   (which you all should go to) so i can take a few moments to breathe. And Post. Things are going well. Got my grades back, a b plus and three a minus'. Not too shabby. Things are still great with R., they just seem to get better the more I know him. Work is good, everything is good, tho my credit card has been a little too happy to see me this season, but i had to get presents...right? Have my classes all set up for next semester: Ancient Art History, Habsburg Central Europe, British History Two, and Intro to GLBT studies. Shouldn't be too bad, i hope.
