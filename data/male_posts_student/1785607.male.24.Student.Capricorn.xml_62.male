Now, I’m not the kind of person that pretends to be artsy and all cultural. My books are for entertainment, for my pleasure, not to show off. Anyway I have such a bad memory that even if I tried to quote a book by heart, I couldn't. So with that in mind, I’ve read Timeline, Smillmarilion, re-read Hannibal, The Iron Tower, and I’m in the middle of the Jurassic Park series. Continuing with this, yesterday, well today in the morning really, as I said before, most of my reading is at night and most of the time it dawns on me reading. So today as I was reading JP by Chrichton, I had this impulse to turn on the TV. As I was surfing through the channels, my favorite show and my favorite episode in all TV history was on: Ally McBeal, S3 ep02 “Fools Night Out”. And that is lucky, it was 4.30 am.  Now, you want to know why do I love this one? Ok! It has to do with several ideas, the first one: I’m a drama queen, and I seek it. Second, it introduced me to one of my favorite singers: Jennifer Holliday, aka Lisa Knowles. Third: great soulful music. Finally, this time it hit too near. Actually, when I saw it today, I had the necessity to look for the transcript, print it and read it. I think now is ideal to post some excerpts of it, so you can know how good and great it is. Here it goes:     Note:  "Ally McBeal", created by David E. Kelley; own by David E. Kelley Production and 20th Century Fox Television. This excerpst are taken from  urlLink The Attic Zone Scripts Collection  with some scene descriptions to explain the mood of the scene.     ..."Fools Night Out"...     ...Richard’s Office. MARK NEWMAN ( the minister ) and RICHARD FISH ( playing with a recorder )     MARK NEWMAN:  I've kept myself into a situation, and I don't know how to handle it.  RICHARD FISH:  What kind of situation ?  MARK NEWMAN:  I've been in a relationship... ( playing with the recorder and it starts to ive feedback, RICHARD FISH stops it )  RICHARD FISH:  Sorry. She's married ?  MARK NEWMAN:  No !  RICHARD FISH:  Guy ?  MARK NEWMAN:  No !  RICHARD FISH:  Sheep ?  MARK NEWMAN:  Would you just let me talk ?  RICHARD FISH:  Yeah. Go ahead.  MARK NEWMAN:  She's the music supervisor of our choir. She also sings in the choir. She's the one you prevailed upon to sing that short people song ?  RICHARD FISH:  Oh, Lisa...  MARK NEWMAN:  Lisa.  RICHARD FISH ( naughty ):  How was she ? I bet she was....  MARK NEWMAN:  Richard, please ! Obviously we weren't married, and I'm the minister. The minister and somebody from the church, I mean, it doesn't exactly make me an altar boy, does it ?  RICHARD FISH:  If you were an altar boy you'd be with a priest. Kidding. Bygones... What's the big deal ? Consenting adults, even unmarried...  MARK NEWMAN:  I'd really appreciate if you let me get through this ?  RICHARD FISH:  Of course.  MARK NEWMAN:  The relationship ended two months ago, I ended it. And it was very painful for her. And since then, the songs she's been singing for our services, well... I feel they're directed at me !     ...Church. MARK NEWMAN is giving a sermon. ALLY MCBEAL, RENEE and RICHARD FISH in the audience.    ( Band starts playing, LISA KNOWLES is standing up in the middle of the choir, she looks at MARK NEWMAN and starts singing )  LISA KNOWLES ( singing ):  I'm so tired of being alone / So tired of being on my own / Won't you help me / Please just as soon as you can / I guess you know...  RICHARD FISH:  This couldn't exactly be a hymn ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  It's an anthem ! I like it.  RENEE:  She's singing to you.  ALLY MCBEAL:  And you !  RENEE:  You got that !  LISA KNOWLES ( singing ):  Love me if you will / Love me if you will / So tired of being alone ( everybody is up in the audience, dancing, including RENEE and ALLY MCBEAL. RICHARD FISH gets up too ).  RICHARD FISH:  Doesn't relate to me.  LISA KNOWLES ( singing ):  I'm so tired / I'm so tired / I'm so tired of being alone... Yeah !  Audience cheers.      ...Cage  Fish office. JOHN CAGE's office, JOHN CAGE, RICHARD FISH and MARK NEWMAN. RICHARD FISH and MARK NEWMAN against some book shelves.     RICHARD FISH:  Tough to fire her, people in that church enjoyed it.  MARK NEWMAN:  Clearly this is not right !  RICHARD FISH:  Even so you slept with her, Mark, she can run that sexual harassment card right up your collar.  MARK NEWMAN:  But I haven't done anything !  RICHARD FISH:  You're a man, you're breathing... Under title VII you're liable.  MARK NEWMAN:  We had a relationship, it ended !  RICHARD FISH ( sitting on JOHN CAGE's desk, JOHN CAGE sitting behind his desk ):  Thing is, that song last night wasn't overtly directed at you  MARK NEWMAN:  So what, you just let her keep doing this ?  JOHN CAGE:  You need to mediate. We need someone who speaks the language of loneliness.      ...Ally's office.     ALLY MCBEAL:  Why me ?  RICHARD FISH:  Because we think you can tackle into her despair.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Why ?  RICHARD FISH:  That sense of utility that comes with knowing no matter how long you live you'll be going alone, uncoupled, and yet charging for it, just the same, never under the false assumption it'll get any better, you're the who-know she might listen to.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Thank you Richard, I live to help others cope.     ...Church. ALLY MCBEAL and LISA KNOWLES walking up stairs with books in their hands.     LISA KNOWLES:  Is he suing me ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  No, no, not at all, but he gets concerned with your choice of music... ( arriving in a room with the choir robes )  LISA KNOWLES:  People tell me they love it. ( putting down the books on a chair )  ALLY MCBEAL:  So you have ? Kind of shifted your tone, since you broke up ?  LISA KNOWLES:  It's the only way I've had to deal with the pain. I've always expressed myself through music. I don't think the congregation picks up on it.  ALLY MCBEAL:  He does.  LISA KNOWLES:  Well he should. ( taking off her robe ) Do you know what he did ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Well, relationships end for a lot of reasons...  LISA KNOWLES:  Do you know what he did ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  No.  LISA KNOWLES:  He changed his heart.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Excuse me ?  LISA KNOWLES:  That's the full explanation. We talked of marriage, we were in love, then suddenly, he says "I've had a change of heart". Doesn't wanna see me anymore.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Well...  LISA KNOWLES:  You don't just leave the scene of an accident. You mow somebody down, you at least stop, check on the victim.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Lisa...  LISA KNOWLES:  I don't sing these songs to hurt him, I sing them to help me. They're my only release. If he doesn't like listening, he can just leave the room. Don't tell me he doesn't know how to do that ! The man knows how to leave a room, trust me !     ...Church, MARK NEWMAN and ALLY MCBEAL walking along the aisles.     MARK NEWMAN:  So she's still gonna sing those songs ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Well, if it works out her pain, and the congregation enjoys it !  MARK NEWMAN:  This is a house of God !  ALLY MCBEAL:  Well, you're the only one that seems to be bothered, Mark. I want to ask you a question. Why have you never really discussed the break-up with her ?  MARK NEWMAN:  I discussed it, I just told her...  ALLY MCBEAL:  Change of heart, yes. Did you love her ?  MARK NEWMAN:  At one point.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Why did you stop loving her ?  MARK NEWMAN:  I don't know, I just did. ( he sits )  ALLY MCBEAL:  You just did ? ( she sits next to him ) Did you ever bother asking yourself why ?  MARK NEWMAN:  Listen...  ALLY MCBEAL ( starting to get angry ):  Maybe it had something to do with stuff you were going through, maybe there were outside forces, maybe you have commitment problems. Lord knows you must take that "till death do us part" stuff seriously !  MARK NEWMAN:  What are...  ALLY MCBEAL:  Did you seek counseling ? Did you do anything to explore what may have caused you to stop loving her or did you just go "Change of heart, see ya" ?  MARK NEWMAN:  Whose side are you on here ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Maybe hers.  LISA KNOWLES ( from behind them, they turn around ):  What was the warning, Mark ? How about "I'm feeling different" ? How about "I'm not so sure"? Why is it always great with men right up until they run ?      ...ALLY MCBEAL walking in the street, with flashbacks of BILLY THOMAS and her when he told her he was leaving.     ALLY MCBEAL ( To BILLY THOMAS ):  I choose the law too. But I choose Boston ( The song stops like a vinyl scratched and flasback stops too ).  ALLY MCBEAL stops walking, suddenly realizing something.   ALLY MCBEAL:  It had nothing to do with going to Michigan !     ...ALLY MCBEAL at the bar, looking into nothing, sitting at the bar, alone, GEORGIA THOMAS comes in.     GEORGIA THOMAS:  Hey !  ALLY MCBEAL ( startled ):  Georgia ! Hey !  GEORGIA THOMAS ( sitting next to her ):  You're drinking ? ( she motions the bartender )  ALLY MCBEAL:  No, no that's just... vodka. I'm getting ready to drink it.  GEORGIA THOMAS:  What's the matter ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Oh, nothing.  GEORGIA THOMAS:  Nothing ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Nothing I can talk to you about.  GEORGIA THOMAS:  Ah, Billy !  ALLY MCBEAL:  Yep.  GEORGIA THOMAS:  What now ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Lisa Knowles. She was saying how, you know, how when men break up with women, they're running away like they're fleeing the scene and then... It hit me. Billy didn't break up with me because he had to go off to Michigan to make law review, he went to Michigan to get away from me. That was just his way of fleeing the scene. Am I right ? ( GEORGIA THOMAS says nothing ) I am right. He didn't have to go that far. Did he formerly have to go all the way to Michigan ? ( She realizes ) He met somebody who was at Michigan. He met you, while he was still with me.  GEORGIA THOMAS:  I didn't know about you.     ...Church. LISA KNOWLES (sitting at a piano) and ALLY MCBEAL.     LISA KNOWLES:  Singing in a bar ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  This could be something you would really enjoy. It's a forum. You need a forum. And, if you agree, I've persuaded Mark Newman to sit down and talk to you.  LISA KNOWLES:  I don't need to sit down and talk with him !  ALLY MCBEAL:  I've... I thought you did. He's willing to address the break-up if you want.  LISA KNOWLES:  He is ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Says he is. I'll be there as mediator.  LISA KNOWLES ( hopeful ):  Does he want to mediate ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  No, he's not saying that, he's willing to sit down and talk about what happened, at least from his side.  LISA KNOWLES:  A lot of people come to this bar ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Great music at this place...  LISA KNOWLES:  It is a good idea to sit down with him, right ? It's better to know.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is better.     ...MARK NEWMAN's office. MARK NEWMAN's sitting behind his desk, ALLY MCBEAL and LISA KNOWLES in front on it.     MARK NEWMAN:  I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say.  LISA KNOWLES:  You've had the whole night to think about it. That's all you could come up with ?  MARK NEWMAN:  What do you want me to say ? ( LISA KNOWLES gets up and starts to leave )  ALLY MCBEAL:  Hold on, Lisa. ( to MARK NEWMAN ) That's not what this is about, you trying to figure out what she wants you to say, and you're not gonna sail through this like some funeral where the church is double booked ! Now what happened ? Give her that.  LISA KNOWLES:  Was there somebody else ?  MARK NEWMAN:  No !  LISA KNOWLES:  Then what Mark ? What ?  MARK NEWMAN ( getting up ):  It just wasn't you. It was never ever going to be you.  LISA KNOWLES:  You said it was. ( ALLY MCBEAL walks away from them, to the window, looking outside )  MARK NEWMAN:  Because I wanted to believe it, I was desperate to. Lisa, you're the best woman I've ever known, your values, your kindness, your beauty, I mean you're everything I've ever looked for, when I finally found you, I felt for sure that I'd fall so deeply in love, I kept waiting for it to happen, but... It didn't.  LISA KNOWLES:  You never loved me ?  MARK NEWMAN:  No I do, I still do. But I've known greater love with women who for other reasons weren't right (ALLY MCBEAL looking outside the window, sad and pensative, maybe feeling related). Look, I knew that marrying you would be the smart thing to do, I mean, you'd be a good mother, we'd be great companions, the most practical thing I could have ever done would have been to marry you, but part of me would have also died inside because... I have no passion for you (LISA KNOWLES closes her eyes in total pain, soul pain). You know I actually used to pray, "God, let me fall in love with her more, please, let me feel it". ( LISA KNOWLES looks sad ) Should I have told you all that ? Do you feel better knowing ? ( LISA KNOWLES puts her index finger on his mouth and looks totally sad ).     ...Elevator in the lobby. ALLY MCBEAL and LISA KNOWLES get out, LISA KNOWLES carrying an outfit in a cry cleaner's plastic bag.     ALLY MCBEAL:  You don't have to rehearse first, Vonda just thought...  LISA KNOWLES:  No, I definitely want to. I don't need to be humiliated twice in one day, thank you !  ALLY MCBEAL:  You know you don't even have to do it tonight, the invitation's open.  LISA KNOWLES:  Trust me, I need to sing tonight. After that.   ALLY MCBEAL:  Are you OK ?  LISA KNOWLES:  I think so. At least I understand it, Ally.  ALLY MCBEAL:  Yeah. Knowing is good.  LISA KNOWLES:  Actually, you know what the worst thing is ? Suppose he hadn't broken it off. I'd be married to a man who wasn't in love with me.  ALLY MCBEAL:  That would be worse.  LISA KNOWLES:  Oh God, can you imagine ? Well, I'm gonna go rehearse. I'l see you down here later ?  ALLY MCBEAL:  Are you kidding ? I will be there.  LISA KNOWLES:  OK !  ALLY MCBEAL:  Break a heart ! ( LISA KNOWLES looks at her, hurt ) Leg ! ( LISA KNOWLES smiles and leaves )     ...The bar downstairs, LISA KNOWLES singing "Fools rush in".     LISA KNOWLES ( singing ):  Fools fall in love in a hurry / Fools give their hearts much too soon / Just play them tunes of stardust  Camera pans RENEE, Elaine, ALLY MCBEAL in the bar   LISA KNOWLES ( singing ):  Just hang out one silly moon  While LISA KNOWLES sings, shots of RICHARD FISH and LING WOO in a restaurant having fun, of GEORGIA THOMAS in bed doing cross-stitching, of BILLY THOMAS alone in his office, of JOHN CAGE buying a rose in the street for NP, of the bar and MARK NEWMAN entering, of RENEE and ELAINE slow dancing with the twins, of ALLY MCBEAL smiling at LISA KNOWLES, of ALLY MCBEAL walking alone in Boston, of BILLY THOMAS in the office, of images of the discussion between LISA KNOWLES and MARK NEWMAN.   LISA KNOWLES ( singing ):  And they've got their love touch hands firmly / When they should be playing it cool / Oh I I used to laugh but now all I understand shake the hand of a brand new fool / Fools fall in love just like school girls / Blinded by rose colour dreams / They build their castles / They build their castles of wishes / With only / With only bright balls for ??? / I lose enough / But now I understand / Shake the hand of a brand new fool / That's what I am / That's what I am / That's what I am / Shake the hand of a brand new fool.    End Credits     Isn't enough to cry for? Ah the drama.
