She's a bitch on wheels. You can read more about her Memorial Day, 2006 in "Graduation Day, Part Two" coming to Michael's blog soon. Or more specifically less than three years.  PS - I am shutting down What Kind of Day Has It Been...Wait for it...Wait for it...Wait for it...25 August 2006. It's a high school blog, and I have signed a three year, $400,000 per entry contract with Blogspot and Blogger. Don't fret, I am allowed unlimited posts at Compendium, until Marten gets bored, and the Comstocks have to start their college applications (and with all their extra-curriculars, to be considered for the 2006-2007 year, they're going to have to start...right now)  Also does anyone wonder why Thomas is perpetually online, yet never posts? I seem him all the time on my buddy list.
