I came up here tonight to get some studying done, and I'm facing the wall where I stuck the Post-it notes with my schedule for this September.  It turns out that the scheduling mistake I referred to in my last entry was not entirely mine.  The course calender did indeed list "Modern Approaches to East Asian History" as being in a time slot that wouldn't conflict with "Fundamentals of Japanese Grammar", but somewhere along they line they must have changed the time slot.  I'm sure I received some notices of timetable changes; I seem to remember having received some kind of missive in the mail, and the cursory skim read I gave it was insufficient to notice the change in time.
