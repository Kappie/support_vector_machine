I was Sasha's first boyfriend too and apparently, her parents don't want her to date until she's out of high school.  Stupid overprotective asian parents.  So my first relationship lasts a day and odd hours.  Wonderful. And I left the stupid Etymology project at school somewher and I have no idea where. I know you don't want to hear about my love life, but I need to vent to someone.  I hope you don't mind to much. SQ(u)EE!
