It's funny because I look back and see that I actually anticipated all this madness.  Actually, it wasn't that bad; demanding, yes, but bad?  Not by any means.  This last month-and-a-half has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding to date.  I've even experienced a little personal growth, which is always welcome.  For those wondering about the AP Gov't exam, I guess in reality it wasn't too bad.  I really should have worked harder in my studying.  What I knew, I knew, and what I didn't...boy, I sure didn't.  I totally blew one of the free-response essays because I mixed up one of the President's formal powers with his informal ones.  ARRRGH!!!  Oh well.  In honestly, I'm so glad that it's over that I almost don't care.  At least I'll tell myself that until AP scores are about to role in at the beginning of July.  Props to Mrs. W's AP Gov't class for making me feel welcome.  Being in a room fool of seniors can be rather intimidating, but they were all cool (or chill, in hip terminology).  All is well.  Well, I'm off to do nothing for the rest of the evening.  It's great: I missed most of the day today and tomorrow I have a field trip with newspaper and yearbook to go to, so I've pretty much had a stress-free week (excepting the AP test, of course).  Seven days and counting...
