But I'll put this out there for people to read if they really have that much free time :)  I'm not going to go into the past much, just start today and go from there.  Today is a typical day.  Work and AWANA.  I work at a car dealership that my grandfather owns.  Our website is  urlLink www.steenauto.com    I don't keep it updated very well 'cause we sell stuff to fast, but it will give you an idea what we have.  Right now my grandfather is in Oklahoma city at a race called the "Chilli Bowl"  My grandparents go every year for a week or so.  I'm sitting in my apartment right now with my  urlLink wife ( urlLink Brooke ) and  urlLink sister ( urlLink Lacee ).  My sister is staying with us for a week since she lived with my grandparents and it's not kewl being alone for that long.  They are both doing homework.  Last night I got them to watch 3 episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation and they actually like it a little.  They even said yes to another episode tonight.  Sweet, so that's where I'm going.  Oh, and I also started lifting weights again.  I got a little depressed when I was wearing out really fast by just playing basketball a little before AWANA.  I used to be able to run 5 miles and never feel that bad.  So I'm going to try to work on that.  Oh, and AWANA is a thing at church we have on Wednesday nights.  I teach some younger kids around 4-6 years old.  Ok, talk to you later.. I'm also going to figure out how to link this to my website... Which is  urlLink www.ahhyeah.com
