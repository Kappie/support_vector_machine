After all, what makes my ramblings any more worthwhile than others'?  Not much. Which is why my ramblings will be a secondary part of this experiment. :-)  This blog is not about me; it's about what I go through on a daily basis. It's about antiquated Latin phrases and English words that don't mean what they should mean. It's about... LAW SCHOOL.  From the millions of pages I read each day, a few choice thoughts or phrases  pop out  at me. They are words that made me stop and think, or chuckle, or often even cry. These are the words that grab my attention during the day, and keep me up at night. They are published in my case books, and said by professors and students in class. They are law school. And that is what I hope to share with you.
