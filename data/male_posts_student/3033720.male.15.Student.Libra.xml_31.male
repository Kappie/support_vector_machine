There is someone I feel like I'm starting to care about very much (yes, I now like someone else, I guess I'm "unstable" right now.) who is going through a very hard time and I feel like no matter how much I try to help it just won't be enough. It's just not fair, the most horible things happen to the best people. And now someone is just making it harder for her. Worse yet, the other person is another one of my friends. But that doesn't matter. Anyways, I'm gonna do everything I can to help this person, even if it costs me the other ones friendship. I owe this person so much (they were one of two people who really kept me going when I just felt like dying, and she still helps me by just making me feel good every time I talk to her) and I wanna do everything I can to help. If that person is reading this, you know who you are, and I promise things will get better.  Anyways, what else did I do today......I haven't posted in a while cause I've been grounded. Today I went saxophone shopping, and thats about it. Well, the year is about over. Yesterday was graduation, it was sorta sad. I nearly cried when I told Adam goodbye. Anyways, I guess this is it for now. Man, I am gonna be so lonely over the summer.....
