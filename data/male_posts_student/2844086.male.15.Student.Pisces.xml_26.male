Ok well not really, but it was quite funny!! I wouldn't mind doing it again sometime. Not anytime soon, but sometime!  Anway I know its been a while since i last posted. I'm sorry! So I guess i have to catch you up. Ok well nothing happened. :) But I was forced to take drivers ed! yeah i know that's what I said too! (that's my new saying.) Oh yeah and the music recital was June 3rd! to read about that click  urlLink here . And that's about all thats been going on. Oh yeah and sang at church June 13! Whew, big step for me. Anyway, I'm wiped out from the car wash so perhaps I will update another day.
