Mrs. Bladon was doing exams so we had a boring lesson with a substitute (but hey, it's ALWAYS boring).  English was ok, as was Biology and Geography, then Maths..! lol  I've been making mad flash cartoons now that I have learnt a few basic skills.  You can see one I made  Here  which is a little cartoony commercial type flash cartoon based on the crazy "Yop!" yoghurt drink thats come out.  Make up your own mind...  I went out about 7:14 and called for Sam, then went up to Craigs.  We went over the field to look for the Lunar eclipse.. but did we see it?  NO!  The bloody clouds!!  Sam went and got some money and he bought chips (I had some!  I'm supposed to be eating healthly lol).  We then head back up toward the field and didn't see a thing, so we went home, the rain bolting down from the... CLOUDS!!!  Grr
