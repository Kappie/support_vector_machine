But although it's long day, I do had a good start because I do managed to solve a programming problem in PROG2 in just ten minutes. It's just a simple problem. But I don't know what will happen next. At least I had a nice start and that's nice for me.  Oh I need to study and do my assignments in calculus and statistics for the class tomorrow.  As for the SONG OF THE DAY... LEAN RIMES CAN'T FIGHT THE MOONLIGHT  Under a lover's sky I'm gonna be with you And no one's gonna be around If you think that you won't fall Well just wait until, 'till the sun goes down Underneath the starlight starlight There's a magical feeling so right It will steal your heart tonight  You can try to resist Try to hide from my kiss But you know, but you know That you, can't fight the moonlight Deep in the dark you'll surrender your heart But you know, but you know That you, can't fight the moonlight, No, you can't fight it It's gonna get to you'r heart  There's no escaping love Once a gentle breeze (once a gentle breeze) Sweeps it's spell upon your heart And no matter what you think It won't be to long 'Till your in my arms Underneath the starlight starlight We'll be lost in the rythm so right  It will steal your heart tonight You can try to resist Try to hide from my kiss But you know, but you know That you, can't fight the moonlight Deep in the dark you'll surrender your heart But you know, but you know That you, can't fight the moonlight, No-o you can't fight it No-o matter what you do The night is gonna get to you.  (Your gonna know) (That I know) Don't try you're never gonna win  Underneath the starlight starlight There's a magical feeling so right It will steal your heart tonight  You can try to resist Try to hide from my kiss But you know, but you know That you, can't fight the moonlight Deep in the dark you'll surrender your heart But you know, but you know That you, can't fight the moonlight, No-o you can't fight it  (repeat)
