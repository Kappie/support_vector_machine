Your reply: Even if what he says is true, you have to crush your opponent in every way possible. Your advantage here is that he cannot see you. Tell him you have plenty of friends, that you ar teh star footbal playa on ur skools team, that you excel in many school subjects and will make it further in life that he ever will, that you are a drug dealer and have tons of money . . . The possibilities are endless. Try to limit yourself to two of these real-life traits though. Oh, and do not tell them you are Batman, it will not work.
