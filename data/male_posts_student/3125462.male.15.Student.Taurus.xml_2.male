User Garbage Fees Should Be Implemented . The answer is really simple. If Garbage Fees are put into place, then a  whole  lot of illegal dumping will take place.  Yup, you guessed it, I'm posting instead of working again. That's because  I'm done all the research I need!  Crazy.  Today marks the day when I enter the 21st century. I just bought a new digital camera. It's a little piece of crap (600 kilopixels) that is just used for point-shoot-download-then-upload to the web. Expect my photo here anytime soon.
