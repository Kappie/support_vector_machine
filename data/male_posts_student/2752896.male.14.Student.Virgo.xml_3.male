The road trip consisted of: -4 days, 3 nights. -20 hours in the car (total) -4 annoying little kids -my best friend -lots of fun and sunshine.  We went to 'Frankenmuth', which was a retarded town, imitating Germany. We thought we were up for a real treat when the restaurants said: "WORLD FAMOUS CHICKEN, GERMAN STYLE" Boy, were we wrong! It was nothing better than KFC. in other words... SUCKED CRAP!  Next day, spent 3 hours in a car, to get to the edge of Lake Michigan, to ride a ferry to an island called 'Macinac Island'. It was pretty boring, and spelled like horse poo. The island had great history though. As a matter of fact, the only reason the island smelt like horse poo, was because the island banned cars. They have bridges and stuff, but the people who actually live on the island do not own cars. They probably own many many many horses. The population of the town is very small; their school (the one and ONLY school on the island) has a graduating class of 2 -10 every year.... haha. The only other special thing about the island, was that the "GRAND HOTEL" was located on that island, was the set of a famous movie called "Somewhere in Time", dated like 1986... and the Grand Hotel is HUGE. It has a porch that stretches all across the length of the Hotel, which is about 2 football fields long... crazy... and it costs a lot to stay there. The cheapest room, at about $200/night, would get you a window. At the other end of the scale, for $3000/night, would get you a personal chef, waiter, messeus (dunno how you spell it) and a whole bunch of ther GRAND stuff. And to step into the foyer of the hotel during the day would cost you $10/person.  Day after that, rode 5 hours in the car to Sudbury. Dirty Dirty Sudbury. Had another history lesson about the big nickel mines. that was pretty boring. i'll cut you the crap. slept the night at sudbury, and went to theirapparently really well known science center. I say apparently, because that's what others have told me. I have a completely different opinion. In short, it was pretty bad compared to the other ones i've been to.  The ride home was another 5 hours in the car, and slept for three hours of the ride. after the three hours, played cards with my best friend for two hours.. that's basically my trip.   yes... quite boring... i can only hope that ottawa (which i am going to visit sometime in august) can be better.
