I just like them young is all, not too young mind you. Legal? sometimes, but never anything younger than year 8. I've never really liked females of my age or older. Some may say that the liking of younger ones is my way of feeling superior (ie. bigger, stronger etc. than them) but this is not true. I don't know what it is... but... *shrugs* I don't know... Seeing as this is an anti-discriminatory site, I dont expect any criticism or the likes, but still... I want it. Comment.... NOW! I YEARN FOR DISCRIMINATION!!!!  - the deeply sorry and very hideous, Jake.
