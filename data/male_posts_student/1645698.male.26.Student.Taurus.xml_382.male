The girls did their nails today and turned out beautiful...damn bubbles...and yes, I will be obsessive about them.  But still very nice nonetheless.    I was hoping that I would have an amusing anecdote today, but unfortunately, I don't.  So, kind of disappointed by that...but ahh, just so excited!!  See you tomorrow, lads and lassies
