Somehow, I ended up having one of those nights where the drunkenness hits you like a ton of bricks, ALL at once.  There we are, closing the bar down, feeling nice, and everything is right in the world.  Suddenly, LOLA can't walk.  I'm thinking in my head "whew, poor thing, I'm glad I'm here to take her home."  I drive her, get her settled, but while she is using the restroom, MY ton of bricks hits.  I find myself in her bed, fully clothed, passing out.  Next thing I know, we're spooning in bed.  Ahhhh, so relaxing.  That is until the flat spins hit.  "uh oh, be right back" i mumbled as I headed to the facilities.  You know the rest of the story.  The only real reason I got up to leave after that, was because I remembered there was leftover pizza in my fridge at home that i simply HAD to consume.  What a great night anyway though.  As SOON as I get around to it, I will post some pictures form the fun night.  Zac, me, lauren, the randoms at the table next to us who joined in on our conversation.  It was fun.  I don't remember who those people were or what their names were, but I do recall that they were from Pauls Valley, Oklahoma and somehow knew lauren and zac's step mother.  Small world.  Small state.  SMALL hangover.  Goals for the day:  Don't shrink my fantastic new Paper Denim jeans that are in the dryer right now.  Do take a shower.  Don't forget to study for my capstone test Monday.  Do go look at new cars in about 30 min.  Don't drink anything alcoholic today.  Do return the 7 (i'm not lying) phone calls I have received in the last hour.  Don't return the other 2 of people I didn't want to talk to anyway.  Do wrap this entry up because it's boring.
