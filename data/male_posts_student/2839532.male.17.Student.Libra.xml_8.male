If you don't know what kind of car that is, then do a quick google and you'll find many fast things from italy ;) .  At any rate, I got my book on cocoa programming today, so hopefully I can pick that up too.  I've also been reading a great deal.. this one book "The Color of Water" by James McBride is extremely good.. its about this black boy whos mother is jewish, and just sort of a dual-biography.  Every other chapter is like from his perspective of growing up, and the others are hers.. its pretty neat.  Plus its summer reading, so its required, but its pretty good for a summer reading book.  I talked to Danielle like 5 times today.. that was cool.  I wrote her a really long email yesterday talking about a bunch of stuff.. I guess she liked it because her reply email was this:  "Wow"  =p  so anyways she and I are doing well, I'm glad to say, despite the fact she's in New York for the next couple weeks.  My mood is good in general.. except that i have some rashes breaking out on a couple places.. i think it might be poison ivey.  At any rate, I'll ttyl.
