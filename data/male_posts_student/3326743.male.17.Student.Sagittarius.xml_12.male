However, they're may be differing opinions.  I simply ask us all to remember that we are Christians and should act as such.  I hope and pray that this works well.  Prayer requests can be mentioned on here to, but remember that we do not know who will be reading.  Speaking of prayer requests I have a huge unspoken.  Please pray.  God knows what for.  I will send each of you Administrator access as soon as I can.  Check your email for it.
