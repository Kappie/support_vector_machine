We got to the office complex a few hours early so we played in the Centennial Park playground.  It was pretty fun to play on the swings and stuff.  Man, sometimes I really wish I could be a carefree kid who can just play in the park and play...  But, alas, I am not a carefree child, I am a busy teenager with lots of committments and such.  Here's a peek at my schedule for this week after school:  (Tonight was NCCJ meeting), Tomorrow is a Rally for Runaway planning meeting at the Oasis Center, Wednesday is either an OYC training session for the Safe Place Sabbath or is an NCCJ organizational meeting to get Nashville high school seniors to register to vote, Thursday is an NCCJ YAC meeting and Marissa is having a "get-together" at her place afterwards.  And that's in addition to all my other homework and committments.  BTW: I have the rough draft of my senior thesis due on Thursday, uh yeah,  Thursday !  Which reminds me, Ms. Anthony dropped a bombshell on the Senior Thesis class today.  She informed us that beginning with the next six weeks, i.e. next Monday, she will be teaching Government.  Yes, Ms. Anthony will be teaching Government.  As in, I will have to listen to Ms. Anthony talk for two periods every day.  No more fifth period lunch hour, sleep hour, social hour, study hall, Calculus hour, etc.  We're going to have to listen to Ms. Anthony.  *sounds of head hitting desk and soft sobbing*  Also, I think I've decided that Jessica will not be callin' me and I've also decided that I'm not going to try to pursue her because her boyfriend (Troy) is a crazy-ass son-of-a-bitch that I don't want to fuck with.  He's someone who is liable to pull out a gun and shoot yo ass because you look at him funny.  Ain't no way I'm gonna cross him about "his woman."  Hell naw, I ain't touchin' that one.  I'd love for her to call me and I'd really like to have the freedom to call her but I'm not gonna fuck with him; if she wants to talk to me she's going to have to throw out the line.  But I don't think she does want to talk to me because anytime she passes my way in the hall she keeps her head straight forward and doesn't direct her eyes towards me at all.  Of course, I don't help the matter because I still haven't said anything to her, but I don't think complete and total lack of eye contact is a very friendly sign either.  Oh well, I've got a lot of homework to do; I'm going to bed.  George out.
