The song touches my soul in a way...  That I am basically thinking of her again.  What she has done probably looks small in the perspective of others, but to me, she was an angel that lit up my whole life.  Her actually talking to me was such a great gift that I couldn't help but feel gracious for...  Damn.  I told myself not to dwell on this anymore but music does really put me down.  Making me think only about her and her beauty, her kindness, her kindred soul.  Damn it.  I don't want this anymore, I don't want to feel love for another knowing that it'll never work.  I now hate love.  I hated how it made me change just so I could get her attention and make her like me for what I'm trying to be for her.  Why did this have to happen?  I'm so confused, I want to feel love but I don't want it due to how fate will come between it and everything.  If anyone has an answer, please tell me...  Relieve me of this confusion so that I could focus on my life again instead of her.
