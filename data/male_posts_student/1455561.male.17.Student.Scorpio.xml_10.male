I downloaded a hacked version of messenger that lets me log on automatically as offline so i can see who is about and log on if it's clear.   i still havent spoken to him, partly because he isnt online that much (hooray) and that when he was i hid.  what mark doesnt know though is that when i do speak to him it will be entirely civilised and that if i get dragged into any more meetings with him mark is involved now. hes coming too.  the transcript of any conversation will be up here when its been done.  and if he should ask for it he would get marks phone number, address and be fed lies about how mark is very concerned with the environment and yet feels that he doesnt want to join the militarist boys brigade.  on the upside if i got a virus it would now get to him too
