Came back here and had the house to myself for a few hours.  It was nice. 5. Talked to Sean on the phone for awhile 6. Parents got home.  As usual, made fun of my hair. 7. Parents tell me I have errands to run tomorrow 8. Wondered why I have so many Sum 41 songs  Not much for you to read about, unfortunately.  I really have nothing to say.  For you, it's been almost exactly 2 months.  Yes, I'm talking to you.  So far no signs of your amazingness dulling.  --Aaron
