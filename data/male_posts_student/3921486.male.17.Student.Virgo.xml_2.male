She had an orientation at 4, we came there at 1 and got finished paying our fees and seeing the counselour around 1:30. Suprising everything was done quickly, so i decided to stay there with her until 4 for her orientation with the honors program. We saw our friend teri there and we hang out until 4. We walk around the campus and went to the vending machine. The honors orientation was in the admission office and i went in there with them, it was a small room. I ask to be in there eventhough I wasn't part of the honors program. IT was really helpful with all the info that the lady gave us. She ask me if i wanted to be in the program, i told her that i didn't meet the requirement because on the paper it say that you need at least a 3.25 gpa to get in the program and i had a 3.243.(I know .007) but she me told that okays, she can still let me in but i needed to show her my transcript. So she told me to go ask one of the counselour outside to print me a copy of my transcript from high school that my school sent to them but they just say no we can't print you one for some reason. So now am just going to mail it to her.   Am glad that i stay with ngoc b/c i got info about the transfering and important stuff and now part of the honor program.  which am excited for but a little worried b/c i never taken any honors class in high school but i'll try my best and try not to be lazy but that impossible....but I will try.   The honors program seem kind da easy to be part of, all you need is 15 credits of honors class, that mean 5 class. There lots of benefits provided like a special studying area, easier to get in UC school and a TAPS program that guarantee you to get in a UC.   But it also means a lot of works and time to put in.  So yeah......my future is ahead and am going to make the best of it.  you only live once.  well unless you believe in reincartion.  but that still different so nevermind.
