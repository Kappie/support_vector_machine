Though the whole CD is great, he has three awesome songs, two of which are: "I Love You This Much," and "You're The One I'm Talkin' To." They are both awesome.   (Everything in quotes from this point is from the song. "I Love You This Much" is about a little boy whose father didn't love him, but that didn't stop him from loving his dad. He never even saw him but once a year. He stood "stretching his arms out as far as they'd go, whispering, "Daddy, I want you to know: I love you this much. And I'm waiting for you to make up your mind. Do you love me too? However long it takes, I'm never giving up. No matter what, I love you this much." His father dies in the song too. "And he said, 'Damn you Daddy,' the day that he died. The man didn't blink, but the little boy cried, "I love you this much. And I'm waiting for you to make up your mind. Do you love me too? However long it takes, I'm never giving up. No matter what, I love you this much." The funeral service: "Half way through the service, while the choir sang a hymn, he looked up at the preacher, and sat and stared at him. He said, 'Forgive me Father,' when he realized that he hadn't been unloved or alone all his life. For his arms were stretched out, as far as they'd go, nailed to the cross, for the whole world to know: I love you this much. And I'm waiting for you to make up your mind. Do you love me too? However long it takes, I'm never giving up. No matter what, I love you this much." He realizes that Jesus loved him so much He died for him.  "You're The One I'm Talkin' To" is an awesome song. The chorus explains the whole idea well: "I don't think the world's all bad, That life is cheap and love don't last. In fact I think it's just a few who'd like us to believe that's true. I think most are sick and tired of all the hip and uninspired saying cool is in and good is out. I bet I've got your attention now. Oh and if I don't then you're the one I'm talkin' to. You're the one I'm talkin' to."   Here are the full lyrics:    I Love You This Much   He can't remember the times that he thought Does my daddy love me? Probably not But that didn't stop him from wishing that he did Didn't keep from wanting or worshiping him  He guesses he saw him about once a year He could still feel the way he felt Standing in tears Stretching his arms out as far as they'd go Wispering daddy, I wan't you to know  I love you this much and I'm waiting on you To make up your mind, do you love me to? However long it takes I'm never giving up No matter what, I love you this much  He grew to hate him for what he had done 'Cause what kind of a father, could do that to his son He said 'damn you daddy', the day that he died The man didn't blink, but the little boy cried  I love you this much and I'm waiting on you To make up your mind, do you love me to? However long it takes I'm never giving up No matter what, I love you this much  Half way through the service While the choir sand a hymn He looked up above the preacher And he sat and stared at him  He said "Forgive me father" When he realized That he been unloved or alone all his life His arms were stretched out as far as they'd go Nailed to the cross, for the whole world to know  I love you this much and I'm waiting on you To make up your mind, do you love me to? However long it takes I'm never giving up No matter what, I love you this much    You're The One I'm Talkin' To   I ain't the best, I ain't the worst Won't be the last, sure ain't the first Man who ever had a dream the finally got a break So don't take this wrong, I know I'm blessed But what you see is what you get My own interpretation of what's missing most these days Identity, a real point of view A little honesty, things all could use  I don't think the world's all bad  That life is cheap and love don't last In fact I think it's just a few who'd like us to believe that's true I think most are sick and tired of all the hip and uninspired Saying cool is in and good is out I bet I've go tyour attention now oh and if I don't then You're the one I'm talkin' to You're the one I'm talkin' to  I'm tired of seeing youthful eyes Growing up desensitized By what thy're seeing on TV, believing that's reality That sex is love and life's a game Where all the winners look the same Designer jeans, expensive shoes, imported cars and attitudes What happened to individuality The right to choose your own destiny?  I don't believe the world's all bad That life is cheap and love don't last That cool is in and good is out  Have I got your attention now? 'Cause if I don't then You're the one I'm talkin' to You're the one I'm talkin' to  Anyway, comment me!  (Remember, me sad?) What songs have the best meanings to you?
