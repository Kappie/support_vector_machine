Next Sunday I shall be leaving for Cheltenham, then on the Monday I shall voyage 40 miles futher south to Cribbs Causeway where, with luck I shall meet a very old [well not old but I've known her for a long time] and dear friend.  However tomorrow I am going to Yorkshire which isn't so good but hey, you give a little you get a little!  Until tomorrow, Fabius.
