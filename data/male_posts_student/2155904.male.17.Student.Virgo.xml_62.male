But can't take these kind of days for granted.  As boring as they might be or as much as Tyke wishes he was doing other stuff he still has to be happy with the fact that he doesn't have to go to school.  Tomorrow might not be a school day so who knows.  If there is school though it is a Wednesday so it ain't too bad.  But if there is school it means he gets to hang out with Haras and Dottie and Purdy.  Not to mention Skippy and the hilarious Amed and Dr. Phil Lelee.  But whatever.  Tyke is looking forward to the next time he gets to go out to lunch.  He could go for a lot of things.  Pie, JIB, Subway, BK, mmmm...it just never ends.  Actually he wants to go to Wendy's but he won't be able to do that very well during lunch.  So he will have to hit that up at some other time.  But it will be good to get out of the house again.  He still actually hasn't finished sending in all of his college applications too.  Which isn't good but he still has time and there is no rush.  This blog was not as good as the previous nights.  But there was more to talk about yesterday.  It sounds like Tyke's friends had fun sledding and such.  Tyke hasn't gone sledding in so long.  At his old house it was fun but there isn't any spot near his new house.  So instead he just ate and watched tv and chatted online which is fun in itself but it is tough to have a day of just talking to a computer.  Hehe, good times though.  But the best part about these snow days is that Tyke and the rest of the seniors don't have to make up these days cuz they will be GRADUATED!!!  That is gonna be great.  College coming up soon...New people...new great times...This seems like a total repeat of past blogs.  Damn, TYKE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING!!!  This weekend better be a blast!  COME ON SCHOOL, GET CANCELLED!!!
