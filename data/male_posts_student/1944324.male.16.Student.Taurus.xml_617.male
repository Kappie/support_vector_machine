Yesterday I posted my Velma Kelly story-- Marten's read it but I don't think any of the rest of you have yet-- on fanfiction.net and it's been REVIEWED TWICE ALREADY! And the reviews are good! Really good! I'm so happy and excited about it! If any of you are interested, it's called "Closing Night" and it's a "Chicago" fic, which is under movies.  Also, I know the name of my roommate for next year. Her name is Katy Holmes. I haven't contacted her yet, because I'm not sure what to say. I need to think about it a bit. But it's weird, because for some reason I had this odd premonition that her name would be Katy. Spelled like that and everything. Hmm.   I am made of POISON!
