Without catching back any thoughts, the day is over. Working for 134 days, the day is over. People said, candles burn the brightest on its last journey. Today, I saw it burning, so brightly, and yet die off so quietly.   Sitting in the AJC lecture theatre for Grand Debate. Looking at the time, moving so fast, towards the end. I can't possibly arrange my thoughts that it's ending. Four months of preparation, it's ending now, just like this. How can I not to be sad? Tears are just hold it on the edge of my eyes. I keep them with me, because i really don't want anyone see that I am crying. I miss everything, everyone, every moment, every meeting, every jokes. every laughter. I feel like breaking down.   Memories of every moment flow back to me. I am sad.  SLC is over. In my life, it's over.  it's over.
