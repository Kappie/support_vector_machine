"This Life" This Life, takes a toll on my mind. Say "Hello", only to find, That I'm not good enough, Just like a pesky scuff. Each night I keep myself awake. I dream in color, but it's innate. When I think about This Life, I think, nobody shares my strife. And now the second one, this one's on a little lighter note.  "My Pet Mink" I have a pet mink, And he is quite pink. Occasionally I will see him wink, As he's taking a drink. And he'll blink, When writing in ink. Some people may think Minks really stink. But ask my pet mink, And he'll just turn pink. LAST DAY OF 1ST SEMESTER!!! YAY!
