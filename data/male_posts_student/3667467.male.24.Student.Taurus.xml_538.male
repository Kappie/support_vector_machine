And I've got pic after boring pic; you'll see them later this weekend.  Tonight I found 10 coffee pots, an 8-foot hand reaper (like the Grim Reaper uses, and the replacement blades), *about* 9 lawnmowers, 20 hubcaps, 8 expired license plates, 3 sleds, and a whole bunch of other crap that just had to go.    CDs today:  Ween, "Paintin' the Town Brown" [2 discs] Led Zeppelin, "Physical Graffiti" [2 discs]      "Led Zeppelin I"      "In Through The Out Door" Natalie Imbrugia, "Left Of The Middle"      "White Lilies Island"      "B-Sides"  Cassettes today (discovered in a box): Oldies 104, "Buffalo Bills Boogie," 1991 and 1992 seasons.  Awesome.
