We haven't been doing anything exciting these last couple days because I'm in the process of moving.  Anyway, Laura visited me at work today.  We're planning to go garage sale hopping on Saturday.  Sunday we might go to Lollipop Farm again.  Cindy also visited me at work, she brought me packing tape and shampoo for my gym trips.  When I got out of work, I went right to my new apartment and walked around a little bit.  It felt really good to be close to everything, close to work, close to Cindy and Laura, close to Rochester, close.  I talked for awhile with my neighbor, he's a physic professor at UR part time.  He said he's the poorest professor I'll ever meet.  He looked ragged.  Poor guy.  But at least now I know I can enter my apartment through the parking lot door and that I have a little patio if I want to sit outside.  It's pretty cool.  I dropped off a couple things in the trunk to make room for my packing.  I went home and ate some leftovers.  I couldn't find my bread from last night, so I asked Cindy if she'd seen it.  She took it and ate it today.  I think I made her feel bad, but that wasn't my intention.  I was just looking forward to some bread!  We had something like 6 6" french bread rolls left.  Jake got home and we played Champions of Norath for 10 minutes and then he left.  He came back with Rachael and Kristen, they ordered pizza and I started packing.  They asked if I wanted some so I paid $5 and ate a couple slices.  Jake later told me I ate more pizza than I paid for and made me once again feel like an idiot.  I asked him why he complains about everything.  I'd give him more money if he needed it.  But I did just host a picnic for all my friends, including him.  You'd think he'd forgive a buck or two.  Enough complaining.  So I packed for the rest of the night, loaded my car up to the brink and am headed to bed.  I watched 5 hours of TV that I've taped over the past 9 days.  It looks like I'm only got 14 hours to go.  Tomorrow I need to go to the apartment after work to wait for the cable guy around 3:30.  Garry is letting me out early.  Good night.
