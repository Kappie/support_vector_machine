(ie; the sheer force of will to post goth and/or angsty poetry) I would probably use that starter as the beginning of some lyrical diatribe of how I am tired of life, tired of choking on its sick excess, on its simple monotony. But really, I'm just fucking tired - the physical exhaustion from a lack of sleep. And sleep, with its ability to cure cancer (according to Stanford), is about the healthiest thing one can do.  I'm a fairly happy person, if not a particuarlly mellow or happy one, or even a excellent speller, but I do know this; blogging helps me not do my term paper. I'm sorry to abuse you, my deliciously sexy readers, but I am merely involving you as a pawn in a game as old as time itself - procrastination. You see, though my term paper shouldn't be exceptionally difficult to write, and the subject is quite interesting ( The FBI/J Edgar Hoover's reaction to the Civil Rights Movement and its reflection on Goverment Policy), I am against writing it on principle. Therefore, I will waste as much time as possible not writing, ending up doing all the work at roughly 3:00 AM the morning of the deadline, despite the fact I had a four day weekend. Ain't I a stinker?  Speaking of movies, you know what was quite good? Triplets of Bellville, a french animated film with only one, repeated once less than thrice, important line of dialogue, which was thankfully translated into english. All other interaction through main characters was done a-lingual, and though there was much French background speech and signs, it would almost ruin the experience if I understood. The other interesting aspect is that I saw it with a group of people, bar one, I do not typically see outside of my school lunch period, which is always a cool thing. It brought me back to my freshman year, when I was "adopted" for a brief period by Eddie Fonner, who proceeded to take me to social gatherings (bowling), much to the recalcitrance of other members (Sylvia). Luckily, I believed I performed much better than way back when, in those years of  intense hormonal awkwardness.  Well sheeeit, it's pretty damn easy to write when I only focus on myself - though the grammatical construction and spelling of the above leaves me quite worried on the outcome of this term paper. Meh, C'est la vie.
