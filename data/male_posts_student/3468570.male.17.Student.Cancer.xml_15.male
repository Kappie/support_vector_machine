A kinda' boring day as we spent our time under stress at the Economics tutorial in which we made to be under a limited time to complete essays...approximately 45 minutes or so. Furthermore, the other class was so damn noisy that I couldn't really concentrate and had to stop short in my tracks whenever I wanted to resume my essay...*sigh*...enough of such thing already~~perhaps it ain't a good time to talk about it~~ -_-  Another problem that is currently pending would be Project Work. It is so kinda' difficult to coordinate, in my opinion, that we had to probably create some disputes while in the progress of it too. Never mind...and I guessed I would delay my Constitution's effect until end of this week due to the badly done draft, which requires editing again. A strict one that would allow a better student to awaken within me.  Why do I sound like someone in my class? Oh no~~~I mustn't change personality again...especially after secondary school where the major change from extreme introvertism to moderate introvertism is there. What else can I say about today? Looks like there is nothing much...and it's way past midnight too...one past midnight with a strong urgency to sleep now.   I must do some work tomorrow...and TUITION tomorrow....what a terrible day!
