The guy misses debates yet goes up in the polls...gets the best press of any Democratic candidate, is the most moderate of the candidates (even Lieberman shows his Democrat stripes on occasion), and seems to keep people happy by his Ivy-league education and General status.    If you didn't see the Iowa Black  Brown debate, too bad...some great stuff.  The cuts that the media showed of Al Sharpton and Howard Dean going at it are quite unfair...yeah, Sharpton got Dean there, but the specific mentioned was that Dean never had a minority on his cabinet...a six-seat group.  Not good, but not the atrocity Sharpton makes it sound.    Best speakers...Kucinich, Sharpton, Gephardt, Dean, Mosely-Braun...the other three somewhere in there.  Kerry and Edwards were really left out of this debate.  Mosely-Braun is a smart woman.    It pisses me off that no one will even give Kucinich a chance...he's immediately made fun of for his height, what looks like a toupee, his bachelor status...the guy has good ideas.  Cut Pentagon fat, repeal Bush tax cut, help schools, work on Social Security, and strive towards health care for all.  Foreign policy of diplomacy rather than bull-mongering is about all you need from me to get my vote this year, but Kucinich is a real liberal's liberal.  If Iowans listen to the debates, he might come in fourth or fifth...could be the groundswell he needs.
