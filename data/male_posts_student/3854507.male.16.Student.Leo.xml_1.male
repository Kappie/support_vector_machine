And while at the same time performing pointless tasks that have no bearing in reality let alone life?  yup, school sports day. My sisters in fact, who is turning 12 this year. I was watching the budding young couch potatoes committing some daring act against good taste...like the three legged race with three people, or the difficult task of throwing a ball at each other, and it struck me that I am SO glad that I never have to do anything like that ever again. what were we thinking???? What were the teachers thinking???? We hate it, they hate it, even the parents are bored rigid.  apart from the rare one or two parents that are just a tad too 'helpful'. Like when they shout tactics until their voice is raw at their 7 year old children.....I can think of few useful places for this kind of people, the only one that comes to mind is, I think is probably enough to be sent to hell for thinking it...  can anyone actually think of any good points of sports day? Primary school sports day, before you get to touch any of the 'fun' equipment like discus and shot-put, yah know....The fun stuff. Oh yeah....There was always being able to throw balls at the faces of people you don't like, and being able to blame it on "trying to win". That and laughing at the fat kid in the lycra shorts....  Who do we blame for this travesty? The children? They don't know any better. The teacher for forcing them? Or the parents who encourage this sort of thing? nah....Much better to blame it on the government. One excuse fits all.
