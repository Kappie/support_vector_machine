She picked me up and we picked up Loose and Sheila, and then went to Wal-Mart. There, Juliana a.k.a. JuJu Beans met us. She hadnt seen Em in like a bajillion years, so there was lots of hugging. :-) We walked around, I picked up a few things... AND I got a text message from the oh so cool Mark saying that he met John. What John you ask? None other than John Pearis himself. (I KNOW!) After Wal-Mart, Nikita met us all at Hooters for dinner. Em and I had to run back to Wal-Mart cuz I forgot to get my dad's 8mm tape and batteries for Loose. It was tons of fun till we got the bill and scrambled to figure out how we were gonna split the payments and wat not... Then Sheila puked, so she and Emily left... Nikita had to go do something... so JuJu Beans, Loose and I went to visit the ever fabulous Neal at his place of employment Suzy-Qs (or however you spell it)... I must say, regardless of all the teasing and insults we swap, Neal is like beyond adorable. ;-) After some Ice-Cream, melted ice cream and 31 cents later, we left... and now I'm here... listening to GOD aka Madonna, and updating you  on my oh so fabulous life. Oh, and here's a heads up: I won't be updating for a while cuz I'm going to Florida for like a week... so now you know. Ahhh!!!!! Cailtin gets back on saturday (I miss my soulMATE soooo much).... and Rob gets back to Binghamton also on saturday.
