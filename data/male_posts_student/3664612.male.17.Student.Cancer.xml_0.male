Its nothing personal, just that they are too good o.O Angelos Charisteas's second-half header ended the holders' hopes of retaining their trophy. I think Greece will go to the finals and hopefully win their first title. It reminds me of the Denmark team in 1992 which won the Euro Cup despite the prediction that they wouldnt even reach the semi-final. Ill write some shit up later. Good Day
