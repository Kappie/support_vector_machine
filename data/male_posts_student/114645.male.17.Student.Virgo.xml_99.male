All of them, lol 2. Are there any that you like or don't mind doing? Cleaning my room is always fun. I always seem to find something I was looking for like a week before and then I found it, and it is like a four year old with a ballon, you are the happiest person alive! 3. Do you have a routine throughout the week or just clean as it's needed? Just clean as it is needed 4. Do you have any odd cleaning/housekeeping quirks or rules? I always have to be listening to music. 5. What was the last thing you cleaned? The computer screen
