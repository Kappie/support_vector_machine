I know you were still painting when I left at 10 and there was more to be done... Horray doing homework after midnight (not)  I hope i don't make this a habit (wasn't it wednesday night last week too?? seems like so long ago).  well the show is going much better now, the set is almost finished and my lights are done (finally!!)  I'll be so glad when this is over (not that I don't enjoy it, but sometimes its frustrating and tiring). hope ya'll come see the show 7:30 tomorrow (well technically today) and friday!
