I did some hot work on the old  urlLink heartzmackie  last night, it's going to be quite a new site once I get finished with it. The only problem though, is the tiny amount of bandwidth I get from geocities. It might not even be running right now, so don't fret if it is down. If you've actually seen it, then you'll recognize those crazy brain 'anatomy' diagrams I'm so fond of. Phrenology is really interesting stuff, it's all wrong, but it was so instrumental in getting to where we are now in understanding that squishy grey smart part of ourselves.  ***** If I had a pair of special boots, then I'd heist the moon too.  I saw ' urlLink Troy ' this weekend with my pops. I would recommend it, except I wouldn't see it again myself. I'm not saying that you have no taste, I'm simply saying I have more. The story is  very  weakly based on what we've been able to figure out about the battle of Troy. Too much romantics shit, too little character development, and no where near enough naked Brad Pitt, half the movie was him wearing nothing, and I demand he wears less. Skin him.  ***** And if I had an amazing net, with a handle a million miles long,  So I'm learning to play the song "In These Woods" by  urlLink Les Savy Fav . It's a challenge though, trying to figure out the synthed keyboard parts of the song. I think It'll be great once KP can play it though. Check this shit out. "I'm afraid we're Hansel-ed, I'm afraid we're Cancel and Grettel-ed, I'm afraid we don't have the mettel, to make it in these woods." Those are really nice words.  ***** I'd reach out my windows and really stretch, and bring the stars to harm.  "I can't stop to mess around, I got a brand new rose in town, ah!"
