Is that excessive, i have basically doubled the amount of shoes that i have.  I so rarely get to indulge my inner imelda marcos, but i did, including buying this great pair of red doc martin boots. Not sure where i will wear red doc martins, but i am sure that i will make sure that i do. Besides i just read that every man will need a pair of red shoes for next season, so i am so avant guard.
