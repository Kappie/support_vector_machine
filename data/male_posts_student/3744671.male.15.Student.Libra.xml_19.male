Here's what I found in the PC department:  Freedom Force James Bond 007: Nightfire Indiana Jones and The Emperor's Tomb Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds Command  Conquer: Renegade Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit Earth  Beyond Sim City 3000 Unlimited Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire Command  Conquer: Red Alert 2 Command  Conquer: Tiberian Sun Tiger Woods PGA Tour Collection SIM Theme Park Lego: Island Extreme Stunts Lego: Soccer Mania SIM Safari SIM Town SIM Coaster   And ALL those games were a little less than $35 Canadian!      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
