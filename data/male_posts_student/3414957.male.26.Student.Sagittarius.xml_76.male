           
      I have typed up 5 (one page) biographies and am almost done with all my English homework for the quarter. I still need to do a frickin' huge art project but I can't do that here so it will have to wait until tomorrow. I am hungry now. My hands are tired of typing so I am taking a break from homework for awhile.   On a happiness note: I feel like I am going nowhere in life and working my ass off in school and going to work and all that stuff....for nothing. We shall see though.
