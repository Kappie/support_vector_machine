I know at a certain point, I will most likely stop due to lack of time and a different focus.   For all the thoughts I have had on life, love, spirituality, peace of mind; I am well aware that the search for those things can be a trap as well, as it is a never ending search. I do not think it is very responsible to spend a whole lifetime solely in search of those things. The reality for me is to reach a point where these urges do not bother me again so I can get back to activism. Of course I will pursue these matters but not to the point where I cannot do research and organize. There is a part of me that is anxious to organize and I am going to try to get back in the swing of things sooner than later.   I do feel that my time in Michigan is numbered. I do not see myself staying here much longer. I am going to do my best to finish school and then do some traveling in the U.S. and in India. I need to get away from everything that has happened the last three years. I took some important steps today in the hopes of leaving Michigan. I will be graduating in December of '04 instead of May '05.   My urge for wanderlust will hopefully be fulfilled over the next years. There is a part of me that says I will not find a community until I understand myself better. I just do not think I can come to terms with myself by staying in Michigan. I need to leave an Indian community that has never respected me or my family. Since neither my mom or dad were a doctor or engineer, they could never one of the gang in the community.  Part 2 coming soonâ€¦
