Thursday: drunk two forties of st. ives and  got really drunk , played flip cup, oh so drunk, stopped fan blade with tounge, assisted karla in the bathroom, cooked tater tots, couldn't eat without ketchup, got ketchup with ericka, karla called me back and said some guys were following her, came to her rescue, she showed me her room and stuff, passed out on bed.  Friday: woke up at 10 am with headache, walked back my room, had an exam in soc of gender, and a calc class. dad and diana picked me up. got home at about 8 pm. went out to chili's with SMUT. went back home and  blazed  a little bit.   Saturday: during the afternoon me and chris met up with tom, erek, jeff, and derek and i drunk a 22 of bud ice and we smoked a blunt in the mall parking lot and some guy parked next to us and started to talk on his phone so we drove around the mall and finished the blunt. went into the mall and i ate 2 meals. picked up the girls and chilled.. then  smoked a blunt  off of exit 14.. then chilled at my house.  Sunday: picked up the girls and we chilled. we were madd bored so we went to see a movie.. me and jena saw half of "Jersey Girl" but the other girls got bored so we left the mall. and went back to my house and  baked out my room  with the last of my tree.  Monday: nick picked me up to get a new bowl. we picked up the girls from the mall and they stole me some shirts and i gave nick one for picking them up. bought a new bowl and went back to my house and watched texas chainsaw. i dropped the girls off and nick came back. we went bum hunting.  we searched dumpsters and alleys for bums . we didn't find any. i think i chilled at pat's house that night for a bit.  Tuesday: happy birthday reza. darin was kind enough to drive us around on shrooms. we first went to get tuxs for prom and then we went to the 4d theater. we got in the car and then i was tripping so hard i didn't know what was going on. we picked up juli and went to austin's. i briefly saw some ppl while i was tripping. then in the corner of the room was a kid i didn't like. i was in no shape to fight, i feared for my well being. if i was sober i would have stayed and opened up a can.. but  i wasn't sober . we left. went back to my house and chilled. i love shrooms.  Wednesday: me and the guys played basketball and shit at farley. after we went to hoyers and then we went to hOOters. then we chilled at mark's house. then  i snuck girls out of their house and smoked them up .  Thursday: took jena m out to a movie and dinner. we saw "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and then ate at Fiesta. The movie was too much like Vanilla Sky, i was outraged. But i had a really fun time with her. After i chilled at Pat's and this kid mike said he would smoke me up if i drove him to someone's house to pick up weed. he wanted me to drive to the house of the kid that i saw on tuesday while tripping hardcore on shrooms. he asked the wrong person. i left and went to sleep.  Friday: i wanted to drink and have ppl over. but everyone was at pat's. and everyone else was out with their girlfriends. and my girls were at the mall stealing more clothes. so i sat there madd bored on a friday at 6pm wishing i was back in albany. the only person home was lauren!! so she came over and we watched movies and chilled. i love lauren!  Saturday:  got really drunk . hungout with the girls and drove them home at 10.  i got upset because i trusted you would tell me the truth . i didn't drive drunk though. then me and chris went to reza's and EVERYONE was there. after we went to alex's driveway because little kids talk madd shit so we set them straight. then we chilled at my house. then i passed out.  Sunday: ate dinner with family and drove back up with kev. just finished doing 2 hours of calc homework and now i'm exhausted.  i left out ALL of the detail.. madd drama went down but i guess that's over with for now...  just friends right ? I have 4 weekends left up here in Albany. I'm going to make the best out of it!!  You can't lose what you don't put in the middle, but you can't win much either.  - R w L super SMUT
