Life's really been in tandem with the weather recently, and not much could make me feel any more contempt at things. I hit the ground running exam wise, and I've finally got the will power to believe I can achieve things this summer i.e. lose weight, work vast quantities of overtime, and gain some confidence. Getting into revision really started this whole thing of, and now, safe in the knowledge that I'll be of to Cardiff to witness the great war between Ian and Dan (Palace and West Ham to you and I respectively), everything's just feels like yayish excitement.  I'm just really keen to do well this year, and explore hopefully new cultures et al, however, that may not be possible considering the furthest I'll probably get from home is work. Nevertheless, this won't dampen my spirits.  Hell I even feel like doing a jog some-time soon. Oh no wait . . . The sofa is still vastly more appealing *sigh*. Hmmmm wonder what's on the box tonight? xBuBzx
