      So here's my last venting rant for a while. I need to kind of organize things for the state of mind I'm in right now, so I've made a couple of lists. The first is a ripoff of what Rob does in High Fidelity (great book and great movie. I spent 9/11 watching this with a friend). So, here it is, for my benefit, my top 5 job list.  1. Professional Writer  At first my job list was just a conglomeration of writing jobs, like screenwriter, or poet, or comic book writer, but really all of these would be great. I mean, I'll do this no matter what I end up doing, so it'd be fantastic to get paid for it as well. As of today I've only made about $150 off of writing, and that's just contests. I wonder if my moral and ethic code would allow me to write some Tom Clancy crap for the bucks. I mean, these books they have at publix are utter shit. There are literally 15 or so books about jet pilots with names like "Punk's Run" and "Blue Skies." Somebody gets paid for this? Who wants to read these flattened out rolls of toilet paper? Old bald guys with a beer gut who like to make believe they'd strangle commies and arabs with old glory if they got the chance? And don't get me started on Harlequin romances. I can think of 20 synonyms for glistening cock. I can write a book like that. Urgh. I guess I just need to start sending out non stop.  2. The Creative Force In A Band  I know, I know. I'm not hip enough. I don't buy my entire wardrobe at Hot Topic, and I don't roll my eyes at anybody who owns Michael Jackson's Thriller (which is a fucking awesome album that I do own). So how could I ever be in a band? It would still be a great gig, to have people want to listen to your music and get paid for it. My problem is organizing the people for the band, though. I can never quite get enough. Also, pretty much every local scene is just rife with nepotism. You don't play unless you know somebody. You don't come back unless you have an entourage of about 30 mall punk girls who think you're the greatest musician since Ludwig Van, and you're so poetic when you sing about "The girl who took my rotten heart/and stepped on it in the dark." Agh! Open a book! Use a thesaurus! Don't sing about the same goddamned shit everybody's been singing about for 200 fucking years! On a side note, Mrs. Keeler, if you're reading this I'd just like to say that the profanity is as much a comedic and rhythmic element as a device for emphasis, so I don't really mean to offend. Unless of course, the person reading it is in some stupid indie band who's in it for fucking girls and money. Agh! *On a side note I was going to make another entry on my list "record label owner," but I think I'll throw it here as a side note. This way I could reject all of these dumb avril lavigne fucks when they send me their demos that daddy paid for. Grrrr.   3. Comic Shop Owner  This'd be ok. I could read comics all day long and talk to people about comics all day long and be surrounded by comics all day long. I'm a nerd. I'd also be a better comic shop owner than the owner of my comic shop, who doesn't know blip bout blap bout comics. The cute girl who works there does, though. Not that I want to ask her out or anything. Well, maybe I do, but so does every other nerd who walks into that store. I went to Megacon in march, which is a massive Orlando based comic book convention, and I realized that whenever I do get a serious girlfriend again I would really like it if she was into comics and would dress up with me to go to one of those conventions. That's totally hot. And I'm a nerd. Did I mention that already?  4. College Professor  I almost cracked and put teacher. Ha ha, just kidding. But college professor would be alright. I mean, I guess if I made it as a writer I could do this in conjunction, but it would be great to always be in an academic environment, surrounded by intelligent people all of the time. The real world really doesn't have a whole lot of them.  5. Forensic Pathologist  Ok, ok. So this job would be pretty fucking sweet. It's just the getting there that irritates me. I hate all of my smug classmates, I hate all of my boring classes, and I hate all of my boring homework. But I blow all of my smug classmates out of the water on tests, I ace all of my boring classes, and I don't really have homework, I just had to stick a number three in there for the rhythmic triad rule. I also really love when I tell somebody I'm going to be a doctor and they get this brightened expression on their face and say "Oh really? Family practice?" and I say "No. Forensic Pathologist. I'll be cutting up dead people." Ha ha ha ha! You don't want me marrying your daughter anymore! Oh, old publix people. Hilarious.    So that helps me a bit. Actually, I have a little bit more ranting to do, but this is a long post, so I'll hold off for a couple of days. Until then, l8r sk8rs.
