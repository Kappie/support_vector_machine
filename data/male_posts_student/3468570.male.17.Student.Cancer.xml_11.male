It is so irritating too!!  And like my friend kept complaining to me, Ng Hui is appearing too many times on TV and now I kinda' have some adversity towards her. 但是，她的确在电视上appear太多次了！这事也烦死我呀！黄慧应该不要在电视上出现太多次的！Hmm...why am I ending all sentences with exclamation marks? Seems like I'm getting too 哈日了！Okay, enough of Chinese influence in this blog entry...it's gettin' out of hand~!~!! =/  じゃ…これは日本語のＳｅｃｔｉｏｎです。未来には日本をいきたいよ！私は来年日本をいって、楽しい旅を感じました！東京市が美しで、アジアの一番楽しい市でございます。これから、今の日は２００４年６月２３日です。日も平成１６年をあり、じつはその年はＩｎａｃｃｕｒａｔｅです。君は私の日本語が一番事と思いなら、事がまたティンクーしてください！僕の日本語はへたで、Ｉｎａｃｃｕｒａｔｅだけど。じゃ…日本語で使うながら多いＲｕｂｂｉｓｈをいいますよ！そして、つづく！  That was a complete load of rubbish in there. And my Japanese was superb, superbly horrid~! It's kinda' terrible when you're unable to write proper Japanese especially when not understanding its grammar properly. Hmm...but any readers should be able to laugh at it too~! =)  Okay, I've got to end this post now! Bye for now! サー！まった次の度だよ！
