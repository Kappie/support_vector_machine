When "Caring is Creepy," played, I was seriously this close to tears. I couldn't believe that there were people all over the world, in film festivals and movie theaters, hearing James' voice. And then Zach decided to dedicate an entire scene to "New Slang." God, he just sat and listened to a song. It wasn't just background music like every other song in every other movie, Zach made it a part of the story. He thought it was such a great song that he had to make an obvious point that he liked it and that it'll change your life. The directing... well, every shot looked like as he had gone through his life, he was always thinking that if he had a camera, something would make a really great shot, and he finally got the chance to shoot them and combine them all and make a fantastic looking movie.  I need to watch more Peter Sarsgaard. I remember him being completely compelling and great in  Shattered Glass , but that's all I've seen of him.  But, it was weird. I know it was pretty and a love story and it had a happy ending and nobody died (well, none of the main characters died), but it hit me different than other love stories have in the past. Like I've been watching  Punch Drunk Love  on a fairly regular basis ever since it returned from Sarah's house, and everytime it ends I just smile and smile and I'm happy because it's so pretty.  Garden State  was equally pretty, but the end result left me really down, and I'm trying to figure out why. I loved the movie and I know it should make me happy like everything else, but it just didn't. When I got home, I just turned on The Living End and climbed into bed. I didn't even talk to any of my family, I just wanted to fall asleep. I hate being like that.  Maybe I just need to take a break from love for a while. Maybe I need to put away  Punch Drunk Love  and  Lost in Translation  and stop reading  Shopgirl  and just bury it in with my other books so I'm not tempted to pick it up again and stop listening to  69 Love Songs   and crank up Tom Petty or Starlight Mints or something    . Maybe I just need to spend the next few days playing Far Cry and Doom 3 and just forgetting about everything. Or at least trying. I don't know if it'll work, but I'm up for anything.  I also got new clothes yesterday, thanks all to Kit and Sydney. I thought they looked fine in the dressing rooms, but I guess everything looks good in the dressing rooms. The pants all fit fine, and it's awesome that I now have pants that actually fit me and I don't have to rely on a shoddy belt to keep myself from exposing my bottom parts. But maybe it's just me, but I still hate my body and think that the shirts hang out in the back and look ridiculous. Why isn't it like that on anybody else? When I walk down the street everybody has trim fitting shirts that look nice on them. I just want to blend in with those people at least once.  The sheep sweater is really small. I love it but, Syd, I think you'll get more use out of it. And you found it, so you deserve it.  Really icky right now.  But it'll get better. When I grow up, I'll be fine and happy.  I watched  Super Size Me  yesterday, and there's lots of things I want to talk about that, but I'm not feeling up to it right now.  Oh, by the way, this is my 25th blogger entry. I stopped liking blogger at about the 15th entry, but I promised myself that I would at least keep it going until number 25. My next blog entry will be back on my home turf of xanga.
