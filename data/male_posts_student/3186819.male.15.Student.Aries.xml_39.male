I got on the bus and it eased off a bit. I got off the bus and it was torrential downpour like uber water and hail like a full blast water hose. I got on another bus and it was all fine! I got off the bus WAM! It started to fall harder again. So the funny i made earlier, I'll be there for it, when the rain starts to fall.........Damn that funny. Damn it to hell and beyond. Not only did the rain start to fall......I'm pretty sure the Hamilton area churches put their offering monies together to build an ark! Two of every animal, except the homosexual....I poke fun because I am on caffeine sleep (which is the state in which I did not sleep, but let caffeine fuel everything) and if I am a bitch first period (because I am construcively evacuating [blah, im skipping] periods 2-4) thats because I went to bed at 1:45 monday night and woke up at 7, didn't sleep tuesday night, so I am sleeping ALL OF WEDNESDAY (minus first period). Welcome to my world. Don't touch the merchandise.......Cause if you do.......Hey look, pretty halucinations dancing in the corner of my room! Elise, were those really advil? Wait a minute, I haven't taken advil for like 2.5 months.....This is what caffeine sleep does to you.....No sleepy, you see thingys....Actually I am not hallucinating, and I am glad I am not. Have a nice night/morning.
