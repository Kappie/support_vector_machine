I gotz me teeth out, was just sitting there, gabbing with the nurses about who knows what, and then I remember waking up to being told to roll on to a recovery bed. It was cool. That was wed, and it is now Monday of the next week. I couldn't eat until Saturday, so the first thing I ate was pizza hut pizza. It was good. My teeth still hurt, and chewing is hard, but what can I do. I dueled Neraka, but I got out of it. Through a series of rp's and such, I don't have to die. Of course, we'll never know who wins. So, I'll go ahead and post it all on here for you. That's about it, have fun chortling.
