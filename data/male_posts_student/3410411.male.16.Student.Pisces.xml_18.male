"wei wanted to tell her how much she means to me....but then....i know she'll tell me...'We're impossible" if i were to tell her......man....can I really tell her...i don't care what she was to tell me....all I wanted is just to let her know..like this I know that i've tired my best.....that was what is on my mind...before the second half...i already know what is the outcome of the second half.....forcing my whole body and mind to stand up....i just surived the onslaughter......man....all this makes up the Limitation of My Tolerance
