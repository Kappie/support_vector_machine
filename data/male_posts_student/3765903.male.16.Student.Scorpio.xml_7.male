Woo! .... hmmm, that's actually a lot less impressive now that it's in writing, ah, this is just the proof I need to show my lack of originality and basic flair for humour... damned bob-cats!  Okay'z, you may have noticed that for the last two weeks I haven't been fulfilling my blogging duties, there is a perfectly adequate explanation for this: I was busy having my soul cursed. You heard it here first, Lanzerote curses young gay mens souls :P... for those of you who are not aware of the Book Of Lanzerote from the Bib-el, when a person is cursed by Lanzeroti their hair becomes green and they are befallen to a terrible sickness, as well as loosing the majority of their syntax... damn that Syntax Stealer!! The holiday wasn't actually that interesting at all... it involved a couple 'undred (700) volcanoes which were extinct, but I did manage to create a minor seismic shock when I walked along this ramp-thing, which I take to be proof that I am fat... the only really interesting thing about the Island was Cesar Manrique, he was this art-east who said that all buildings should only have a maximum of 3 stories and the only colours that could be used are; white, green and blue - that's why there's so many multi-story hotels painted magneta I reckon... He also erected what I'd call sculptures around the island, the majority of them were free moving (i.e, they moved via the wind) but there were a few pornographic ones! I fully deny that I was the only person to notice these sculptures!!! The only really funny about the holiday, except for the sheer amount of times I managed to bash my head on the bottom of the swimming pool, was too see Mum try and disguise her twitch whenever she was around her parents... ah, I'll never forget that meeting with Angela! lol! One good thing about the island was that everything was REALLY cheap, and I discovered on the last but one day that I had only actually spent Â£13 on myself so promptly brought me a bandana... hmm, you know, I really don't think I could be more boring than this if I tried.  One thing that was definitly NOT boring was yesterday!!! I spent an entire day with Stephanie!! Woo! Mucho Muhco fun!! We toured around Merry Hill for a bit and became appaled at the severe lack of 80's Style Clothes and promptly set of to Briely Hill to the Charity Shops (Well done hunni for comming in by the way :P) but we came out unrewarded  and lustful... sorry, that was back in the lifts... i mean...  ... we then walked back to my house (to work of the chocolate fudge cake...) and hired us a DVD which we "watched"   and some popcorn for us to taste   which we set about to watch for... actually, how long was it Steph, I can't remember myself ;)!. After Mum cooked us a Pizza which we barely ate I chaperoned my Royal Partner back to her home and on the way discovered the plight of Newsagents when they run out of Pornographic magazines, the size of a certain something (LOL!) and how leprachauns walk! I Love You Stephanie!  I also got to see Stephanie today again because I had forgotten to give her back her keys so her Mom had to drive her up to here to pick 'em up, soz I didn't remind you yesterday but I think i was a little overwhelmed ;) and it also meant I got to give you another hug! yay! I have socks on Steph.  Ooohhh! I've gotta be finishing this now, as the bottles are burning and I fear the bob-cats may steal my bobblehat. Have fun! Marin J.
