Really think about how you feel about the issues asked of you, and respond accordingly. Before you submit your answers for calculations, uncheck the three boxes at question 17, "Candidate Viability." Leaving them checked will limit what candidates can appear on your list. (Based on your answers, you'll receive a list of candidates in the order of how well they reflect your point of view, starting with the best/highest match. Then post your list here. Here's mine:  DANNY'S LIST OF IDEAL CANDIDATES, FROM MOST IDEAL TO LEAST 1. Your ideal theoretical candidate. (100%) 2. Cobb, David - Green Party (90%) 3. Nader, Ralph - Independent (85%) 4.
