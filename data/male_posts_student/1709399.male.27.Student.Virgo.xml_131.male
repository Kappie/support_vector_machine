The tune was a complete copy of a Nusral Fateh Ali Khan Qawwali I had listened to a few years back. The most surprising thing was that  they had even copied some of the lyrics too. But this isn't surprising for Bollywood which in the last 20 years has thrived on Plagiarism of all kinds. Here is a wondeful  urlLink site  on Plagirism in Bollywood  Tamil Filmworld. This guy has an amazing repository of the original versus the copied ones (audio files) and you can listen to them and find out how many of the popular songs of recent years have actually been inspired (isn't that the term music directors use ?) .
