From the  urlLink Drudge Report :     The 9/11 commission report offers a broad critique of a central tenet of the Bush administration's foreign policy, that the attacks have required a 'war on terrorism'... The report argues that the notion of fighting an enemy called "terrorism" is too diffuse and vague to be effective. Strikingly, the report also makes no reference to the invasion of Iraq as being part of the war on terrorism, a frequent assertion of President Bush and his top aides...  In other news, a threatning note found on an Amtrak train  urlLink caused a 90-minute delay  today ( urlLink Pandagon  has a nice spin on it). The train, on a Washington-to-New York route, was deemed safe after police inspection and continued on. If you're like me, then you're probably wondering how an Amtrak train being 90 minutes late is newsworthy. Sounds like a pretty efficient day by their standards!
