It's been months since I even thought about posting here. Sorry. I hope none of you contemplated suicide while I was away. I'm back now and everything is gonna' be alright. So. School. First term was a wake up call. I moved up in english and math on level and realized that it would be harder. I scraped by with low a's and high b's, but I earned a C+ in math. Boooo... Semi-formal. Good enough to write about, at least. I danced quite a bit, made a few new friends, and left just as sober as I was when I came in. Funny story: while I was dancing, I saw one of those little bottles of liquor roll across the floor. I heard a bunch of people got kicked out, but mostly for fighting. My trip to Montanta... in August. It was pretty fun. I went fishing with my cousin, ate  way  too much food, and was generally lazy. What have I been looking at lately, you ask?  urlLink http://mehalan.proboards23.com  - This is my friend Requiem's board.
