We have just been in really nice moods with each other 24/7 (for a change). The stubborness that was constantly there has dissapeared and when we get to the typical point where we are on the verge of falling out, we don't. It just seems to fade.  I really want to be with her still and I really do want to be able to say I can make it work. But I have tried in the past and it didn't get me very far. I just don't know why all the petty arguments stop as soon as we split. Mandy and I are still madly in love and it's too hard to just let go of this, even if it does make us both unhappy a lot of the time, because the times we have that aren't bad are fucking amazing. And I'm still not giving up on this. She's still my angel.   Always will be.
