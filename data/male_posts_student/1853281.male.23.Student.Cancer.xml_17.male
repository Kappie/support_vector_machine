I am not in the greatest of mental states, I seem to be a wee bit depressed, but I am going to school, doing my work, not drinking alot, alone, like i did last year. Probably best for my liver and my pocket book that i am not going through a bottle of Jim Beam a week by myself. Thanks to all of my friends, I think that i am actually functioning despite being depressed, as opposed to my past track record of crashing and burning. Thank you everyone who listens to me moan and makes me laugh and keeps me smiling cheers devin
