I had a good time, and I ate a lot of pasta and desert, not a well-balanced diet. Now, that enjoyment I had last night (today is Sunday) was kind balanced by me getting a mild case of diarrhea. That's okay, it isn't terrible, it's just annoying, though now I have a reason to hate case and effect. Also,  today I finished recording my Band Final songs and everything, and I put together a huge Player's Choice package (part of the Band Final). It has a bunch of songs, all of which are awesome. Oh, and Ronald Reagan died yesterday. I'd be sad, except I wasn't alive during his presidency. Weird though, he was an actor, but he spent the last decade fighting Alzhiemers disease. Ah, well. You win some, you lose some.
