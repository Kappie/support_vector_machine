It was OK for me because i felt nothing at this moment. And she wasn't to attractive to me. A normal girl. Not a 'hot chick'.  Two Month ago. 4-5 month after i told her she's not the type of girl i prefer the feeling i could have missed something(or someone...) came up in me. Maybe she's not that bad... Maybe i missed a big chance. Maybe it's wonderful being in a "relationship" with her.. Ok, long story short: I fell in love. But i didn't have her number. She changed her old number and i had no chance to call her.. After over a month of talking about this thing with friends i decided to call her at home.  I was scared. Scared as hell and i never got her on the phone after three times of trying. Today i called again. And guess what? She was on the phone. Wow. But guess again? She had no more interest.  Haha. My hope was totally destroyed by just one call and two minutes of talking.  P.S.: My english is waaaay to bad to explain the whole story...
