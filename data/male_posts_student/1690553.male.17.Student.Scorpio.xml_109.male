Medicine (Anaesthesiology) (UKM)     MANUAL OF RESCUSCITATION  for Medical Undergraduates and Health Professionals  is meant to complement the series of lecture and the various workshops that these students will undergo. It will also benefit anyone who wishes to learn aout resuscitation such as paramedics, doctors, parents and teachers. For those who are already competent in this field, this book will serve as a quick revision for BLS, ACLS, PALS, and ATLS.  There is now an increased public awareness of the value and role of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It is therefore not surprising that the public expect a reasonable level of expertise of medical doctors in the application of the CPR techniques during emergency situations. Unfortunately,many newly qualified doctors often lack confidence and are usually lost when faced with such situations, as they had not received practical training before graduation. The manuals hence will be an easy guide and reference for them.
