So I’m reading it and in midst reading I looked at proverbs and started to look at the difference between the two... I mean it’s certain that Solomon wrote Proverbs (at least the first 26 or so books) and accepted that he wrote Ecc.  I just noticed the difference in tone between the two books.  Proverbs almost immediately starts out that God will take care of the righteous.  He pleads with the young to listen to him that they may have a long life and peace in that life.  He goes on to say “Honor the Lord with your possessions, And with the firstfruits of all your increase; So your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine”   I just noticed it’s almost a polar opposite from Ecc. And I couldn’t figure it out (at first) I was thinking to myself.  Man, what changed? What’s the difference in Solomon’s life?  In one book he basically says it’s all good to “have” things and in Ecc. He basically comes to the conclusion that “it all sucks and is all vanity” so I started studying and found a couple of interesting things about Ecc.    Nowhere in the book does God speak.  Meaning in the entire book there is no prophecy and no message from God.  next it would appear that Solomon wrote it while he was in a backslidden state.  As he states “And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness(1) and folly(2): I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.”  to shine; to make a show; to boast; to clamorously foolish; to rave; to celebrate; to show or display loss of self-control; to rave with self-conceit silliness. Translated as folly or foolishness  So now it begins to make more sense... That of course if you were backslidden everything is vanity.  Life is vanity.  Like he says “Yet, better than both is he who has never existed, Who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun”  And he even goes on to say  “Better a poor and wise youth, Than an old and foolish king who will be admonished no more” (could he be talking of himself? Remembering that he did not have a pleasant childhood and that David had to step down as king while he was still alive due to the struggle for power, and this was unprecedented for a King to give up his throne while he was still living.)
