Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink This Love -Maroon 5  Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #5  Following in the wake of other number-in-name rock clusters, a throne previously warmed by  Third Eye Blind  and  Matchbox 20 ,  Maroon 5  have burst into the mainstream with two high-charting hits, the latter of which is this summer’s pop/rock gem. Called “This Love,” it’s somewhat of a narrative allowing singer  Adam Levine  to evoke sympathy in his grievance of how it’s so hard to “keep [his girlfriend] coming every night.” Reworking the same piano-pound bass line that helped  Santana’s  “Smooth” overheat the masses in summer 1999, the track lays down funk guitars and sturdy percussion to match  Levine’s  faux-soul delivery. Constantly equating love to “just a game” (remember  Santana’s  second comeback hit with  Michelle Branch , “Game of Love?”), the boys of  Maroon 5  chug through a breakup song that ends in  Levine’s  unwillingness to “say goodbye anymore” to his constantly-leaving lady. This single’s underlying moral may be that if you want a relationship with a Type A vocalist (we’re thinking  Rob Thomas ,  Mark McGrath ), your connection will have to be a little deeper than coming and going.   The Verdict:  6.5/10 - The Fork   (3.25/5)
