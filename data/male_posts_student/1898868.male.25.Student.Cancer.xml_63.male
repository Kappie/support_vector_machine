Will this nix our plans to run the marathon in Speedo's? Has the Speedo brand become such a part of the american vocabulary that it no longer needs to be capitalized unless referring to the actual brand? You know, like Teva's. Bagel, thanks for the welcome to the blog. I have actually placed an anonymous suggestion in our PD suggestion box that we wear dark blue capes. I just find it appropriate. I think I will also find it appropriate to suggest swords. Oh, and whips too; big, long ones, with the very thick well-fastened handles.  There are two things I hate in this world. One is Colin Farrell. The other is Josh Hartnett.
