The zoo was kind of empty for the most part there were people but not alot. Anyhow i don't feel lke talking about the zoo anymoremore guess what? I'm dying my hair brown back to it's original color, I am bleached at the moment, in any case I'll probobly bleach it again in a couple of weeks. Let's see i attended a quincenara There's a accent on the 2nd n i would have place dit but don't know how, but as it's been Americanized it is more often called a 15, the female rite of passage into womanhood. From the begining i had mixed feelings about it, so to everyone reading this don't make a decision's that take up time by Flipping a coin it's sad i did and twice but i had mixed feelings about so that's why i did, i was thinking it's a 15 their bounf to have soem good food, and i don't feel like going stayin inside, but then there's also the con's which were what if the food is bad what if they have a terrible band, what if i sit and do nothing my mom told me that we were going to be there for 3 or4 hrs so that assured me more and put me in a position to flip a coin, afterwards i regreted flipping that coin twice....................... more to come in the next entry about it
