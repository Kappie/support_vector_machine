Ok for some reason I'm addicted to this  urlLink Alkaline Trio  song "Warbrain" on the  Rock Against Bush  compilation. Actually I've been listening to Alkaline Trio quite a bit recently. I think they're one of the few bands who can do songs about women and love without sounding sappy and lame. It's probably the dark imagery they employ.  I saw this Japanese movie called  Ichi the Killer  yesterday and it had THE MOST FUCKED UP SHIT I'VE EVER SEEN! I'm pretty fucked up myself... the other that I made the following comment to my friend: "I kind of want to email my 6th grade teacher and say 'You fat bitch, I'm surprised diabetes or other fat related diseases didn't kill you off already.'" Yes, I can make comments like that, but seeing a girl get her nipples sliced off, a guy hanging from a bunch of hooks in his flesh and another guy sticking knitting needles through him, rape, stuff I think was cum dripping and lots of dismembering was really pushing it for me. This ranks up there with  8 mm , but this movie because of a weird plot about gangsters, brainwashing, sadism and masochism made things worse. At least 8 mm had some sort of coherent plot?  Oh by the way, I put up pictures of my cleaned, redecorated, rearranged room.
