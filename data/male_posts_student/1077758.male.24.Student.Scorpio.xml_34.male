Meet up, go to a park, talk/walk around, do some assorted stuff around town between, and then grab a little bite to eat at-of all places-Sonic.  The funniest thing is that I never get bored doing this.  It's the same routine, but it's definitely not the same trip.  P.S.  Sonic Cream Slushes are the wicky-wicky bomb.
