She had second thoughts bout the rumours I was talking about before.. Yeah.. She explained everything... I understand... And I poured what is inside my mind towards her.. She's afraid her friends might despice her and hate her.. I know that.. But the least she can do was to consider what her friends said and think rationally because it's between me and her.. Her friends may have opinions bout the relationships.. Some don't like it.. Most probably I'm not their race.. So.. Jenni.. If you're reading this post.. All I wanna say was.. Please think about it.. Think rationally and maturely.. It's between us.. Your friends may have objections bout us but you have the power to think which one is wrong and right. I know you can't live without your friends.. And I know they're important to you.. All I wanna you to do now is THINK....
