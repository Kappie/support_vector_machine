In the lab, I felt my body temperature dropped rapidly. I was shivering and my last finger went numb. If I were to stay in there any longer, I’ll pengz loh… Taking short walk in and out of the com lab, warmed me up just a little. 2.45pm!!! I’m done with my work, same goes with Shawn… Finally I can leave that freezing lab. We (Shawn and me) went to another com lab which was much warmer to print out our write ups, but I didn’t want to return to the freezer that early so we stayed there playing Bowman while waiting for the others to send us their work to print.   It was a battle of stamina I tell you, we were there trying to shoot each other down for 1hr+. ohya, and Tara got herself 4 more doraemons, bringing her collection up to a total of 11 doraemon figurines. And she was so tempted to buy this gundam seed karapuchi she saw at the same comics connection she bought her doraemons from. After, all the figurines talk (sms), she took a short nap. Just nice, Cher Hao  the girls’ work are all done and sent to my school server space for printing. Yupz I left the com signed in under my name back at the freezer on, that’s why they can excess my server space. Shawn and I did this “Pay Up!” drawing and saved in my server space to let Cher Hao see. And when we got back, lots of 5cents were on my desk… WAhahhahaaa….   Work all handed up, yeah! But Desmond, Kenneth they all have already left school after badminton. It’s so disappointing that I couldn’t join them. Well, you can’t always have things to go your way can you? Did a little figurine search for Tara back at home. She was so tempted to buy the gundam karapuchi and was like can’t decide. So I suggested for her to flip the coin. Head means to buy, Tail means to buy it later. HAhahahaa… I guess she was fated to get them after all, 3 toss and 3 heads. So I told her where the shop was, with a very ugly map. Soon I was chase off the computer by Lao Er.
