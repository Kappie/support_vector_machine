Then when we thought all was fine we went to Wendy's to enjoy a nice lunch.....everything was fine until we realized half way home my sister had left her purse there....great just great.  We got there, lucky for her sake it was there, we drove home only to remember that another car of ours needed to be picked up from the garage, so we went to hop in the rental car when we realized....the battery was dead GREAT.  My dad got someone from BCAA to come over and jump the car and i got to watch Star Trek Nemesis :D :D lol.  Then once everything was settled we sat down to watch The Godfather to remember Marlon Brandow's death.  It was actually an excellent movie, we then watched somethings gotta give which was an ok movie, but it still had its fare share of romance in it.  I tried to drink some vodka today lol, bad idea i almost vomited just tasting it that will take probably 1 month to forget how horrible it tastes...but even then i will still remember that night.  I got my hair cut 2 inches it is still long but i dont like it lol, it looks....suspicous like a criminal lol, looks like its been cut more then i asked for but i did not question the hairdresser because i doubted that she would just lie to me for no reason.  Not alot in the news today, not even in technology wow that sucks, i like to do my daily newsreading but still there was like nothing to read about except for marlon brandos death.  Hehe but i did get the pleasure of reading a National Enquirer front page: Mary-Kates cocaine addiction, they now believe that she had a cocaine addiction and had lost weight from all the drugs, im not positive but it still is pretty possible.  In Ultima Online i went hunting which pretty much pissed me off lol, so i decided to raise my stats so my guy would be way better.  I am good at Player vs Monster, but not Player vs Player (PvM, PvP.)  A girl that i know and am friends with got drunk today, i am not all that sure that i like that, i mean we are good friends and i didnt really expect her to do that, but she did...oh well her life not mine (even though i get drunk as much as i can haha.)  I think that once i finally get home i am going to have to goto the river with my friends, or at least hang out with them, its been so long lol, ever since Sunday when i got loaded lol.  I think if i do get drunk later some other time i most likely will just drink plenty beer, and a little bit of rum, that way i wont vomit from binge drinking.  I only realized today that i only have to go through 3 years of school, i mean that still is alot but i never really thought about how really it is farely short lol, well you know what i mean.  Although once i get out i probably will goto BCIT asap, or get a job for a year or something so i can afford to live in an apartment lol.  I wanna see spiderman 2 that looks wicked, me and my dad will probably go see it next weekend, because right now seeing as it has been out for only 3 days it is probably PACKED.  Well thats really all i have to say right now.  Chris  Talking to: noone Listening to: nothing thinking of :gillian and how hot she is lol
