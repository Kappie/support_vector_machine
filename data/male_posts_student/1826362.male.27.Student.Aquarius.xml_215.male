I gave her a dirty look and when she turned around to look for sympathy from me she said "well, it's just that everybody is so passive nowadays.  don't you think?" No, i don't think so.  I think people are too rude and inconsiderate.  there is a difference between not being poassive, and being a great big jerk.  that's what I would have said if I weren't so passive.  Instead I shrugged and didn't speak to her.
