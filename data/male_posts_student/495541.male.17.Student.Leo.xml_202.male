I got him to sign my shirt.  I first asked him to sign my hat, but decided against that becuase it was an L.A. Lakers cap.  That was weird.  Pretty much all I did today was sit around.  Oh yeah I went to weight lifting this morning.  That was it.  Then tonight I decided to download 50 or so episodes of Seinfeld.  I have over 100 now.  I should have them all downloaded by the end of the weekend.  Then I guess I'll figure out a way to hook my computer up to my TV and watch them in a Seinfeld marithon.  That should be interesting.  Well I think I'm going to bed.  I have basketball at Kennedy all day tomorrow.  I am listening to: " Girls Dem Suga (Radiostorm.com: HIP-HOP R) " by  Beanie Man
