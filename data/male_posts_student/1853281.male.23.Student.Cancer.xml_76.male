Than K. and R. and i hung out....watched a movie...R. and i got plastered on one drink each, but than again i  was  the bartender. saturday...research and than coffee with internest guy, J. sunday....date with J. we went to see in Dreams....Bertolucci's new film. There was no plot. Very attractive people, expert cinamatography...but no plot line. turned out J. was totally unprepared to date...no dating babies in the future Devin!!!
