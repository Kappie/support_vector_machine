Multiply by 80 3. Add 1 4. Multiply by 250 5. Add the last 4 digits of your phone number 6. Add the last 4 digits of your phone number again 7. Subtract 250 8. Divide by 2 Is this your phone number?  This is cool. It works for me, does it work for you? I'm done posting for the year. I hope everyone has a Happy Christmas and a great New Year.
