That means long bus ride.  Now, long bus ride is okay, because I have people to talk to, but it would rock if...oh, I don't know...Katie was in pep band, maybe.  Heh.  But, you know, long band trips always turn out fun in some way in the end, even if I just get stuck talking to Kyle the whole trip, won't be too bad.  -  In other news, I now have heard the worst Starwars Joke EVER...I MEAN. EVER!  Ask me if you want to hear it.  -  Dead baby joke count: 9  SO TWISTED!  SO WRONG!! SO...funny...ew...now I feel dirty...  -  I've changed my drink from Dew to Pepsi, because of that music contest.  I feel so deprived...
