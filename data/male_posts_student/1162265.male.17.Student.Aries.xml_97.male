I think it had something to do with pregnancy, which is a pretty foreign concept to a little nino like me, but I had a complete mental shift from that for a second.  Pretty strange.  Speaking of a Gnostic moment, it all became clear.  The story I was writting, I could continue it in a second story with the most obvious thing? The Illumanati!  I'd better starting writting it soon before I hate the idea, considering my bi-polar nation.  Even better, tommorow I got like 50 bucks headed my way.  Life is good.
