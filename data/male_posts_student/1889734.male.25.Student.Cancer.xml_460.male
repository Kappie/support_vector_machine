Imagine they planted some democrats with stuff.  highly toxic poison... I guess that's one "response" to Bush's falling poll numbers, eh?  Oh yes...  they have to do something to instill fear, terror, and awe...Must be something BIG going on since they're diverting attention again..    how come we managed to go over 200 years and it's only been since Bush took office that we've had all these kinds of 'attacks'. I know there there have been events beforehand, but it really seems to have picked up speed since the sheep put the chimp in charge.  It'd be interesting to know if many people have wondered if the same administration which lays waste to thousands of people OUTSIDE the country wouldn't also be happy to kill off people of different political outlooks WITHIN the country, too.  Politically motivated neocon plant.  They are showing that they can strike congress at anytime.  The PNAC and the NEOCONS is the terrorist group we should be fearing.
