For those of you who don't know, Impact records was one of those REALLY FUCKING COOL independent record stores, that in addition to selling just about every record ever, also sold DVD's, comics, jewelry, collectibles, magazines and funny as hell / heavy metal t-shirts. The staff were about as alternative as you get, and the whole thingoccupied this gigantic basement slap bang in the middle of civic. And now they are turning it into a JB Hi-Fi outlet. BASTARDS!.
