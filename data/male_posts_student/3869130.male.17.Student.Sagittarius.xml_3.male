All right...so I come up today at around 3 and Geoff (a.k.a. Master Biatch) leaves for Rochester at some playboy convention... Anyway, Bob and I installed the wired network at Geoff's  when he wasn't home!   WE ARE the NETWORK MAC DADDYS!!     Anyway... I hope  everyone  is here tomorrow just so we can game like the mass-ass gamers that we truly are!  I love my computer  //Stephen //REM's are the best!
