And oh as I fade away, They’ll all look at me and say, and they’ll say, Hey look at him! I’ll never live that way. But that’s okay They’re just afraid to change. When you feel your life ain’t worth living You’ve got to stand up and Take a look around you then a look way up to the sky. And when your deepest thoughts are broken, Keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin’ it’s time to die. And as we all play parts of tomorrow, Some ways will work and other ways we’ll play. But I know we all can’t stay here forever, So I want to write my words on the face of today. And then they’ll paint it And oh as I fade away, They’ll all look at me and they’ll say, Hey look at him and where he is these days. When life is hard, you have to change.
