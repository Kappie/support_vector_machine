Why can't I just be content? Why do I worry so much? Why did I stay up all night before the last day of school? Why can't other people make up their minds? Why does he piss me off so much? Why does she piss me off so much? Why do THEY piss me off so much? Why am I not special?  I'm such a downer...I wish I was happy.  I wish everyone was happy, but for one person to be happy, sumone else must get hurt...at least that's how High School seems to work. High School is over for now however.  Ever wish you would never see sumone ever again???  And spend hours upon hours into the night just praying and hoping that everything will work out, and people can just be happy, and you could just move on with your life?  Trapped...that's my new theme....I'm trapped. I can't move forward without hurting and can't move backward without hurting, whether it is MY pain or sumone elses...there is always pain.  Why can't people just see it?!?!?!  I try to help one person...but just hurt myself.  I can't talk to this person about it...especially because it's summer now...but i couldn't during school either.  I'm shy too.    Tina was just about ready to cry at the lunch table...and I couldn't do anything to help, evn though I wanted to really badly.  People try to help me, but I can't do anything but cry.    If you were to spend any ammount of time around me, you would be able to tell what I'm thinking...Why can't people help me??  Why must I be so shy and conceded?    Anytime sumone tries to get in my shell, I push them away.  If sumone were to get inside my shell, I would be open and vulnerable, open to more pain...  Can't get hurt anymore...  The pain has to stop. The only way I know how to stop the pain is to cause more pain.  I would be philisophical about this, and say that this is all just a big test or sumthing and it will end eventually, and people will be happy.  That's NOT gonna happen anytime soon.
