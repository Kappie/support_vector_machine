Anyway, I've taken a break while my mom left to take my sister to soccer practice. I mean, there's only so must work you can take at a time.   It's almost August. You know what that means. New desktop. New layout. Hopefully a new book. School *puck*. Fall. New Blogs. A lot of other stuff. My grandmother's B-day, and so on.  Speaking of which, my sister's B-day is on the 29th. Just 2 days away. Hope she wasn't expecting a cake, because as far as I know we don't have one. Ah. Oh well. She doesn't deserve one. (Ok she does, but just incase she's reading my blog..... work with me here)   Anyway, we all bought her clothes. I paid for some my mom picked out. Noooo.... it's gotta be clothes. She wouldn't let me buy anything else. Geezes. She'll be 17. Almost off to collag so I can have her room. Wahoo! Well.... see ya.
