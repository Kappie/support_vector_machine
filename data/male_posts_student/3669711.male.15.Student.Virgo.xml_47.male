Last night, i started a download for Pia Carrot 2 DX.  Something like 948 MB.  It finished in 5 hours.  Yesterday morning it started a download for a set of anime OSTs.  only 600 MB.  14 hours later, 15 %. Thats right, i was more than a bit frusterated.    I've had the OST download going all morning, and it has progressed another 15%, and is still puttering along at a slow speed of about 4 kbps. All that i hope is that it finishes within the next century.  Yes, it feels like it is going to take that long.  But thinking back to the days of 56K (which wasn't that long ago), its not going that slow.  I couldn't use the BT client back then, it would have taken years for a download to complete.  It took years for a 32 MB file to complete.  I think about 3 days... That's a long time.    Come to think of it, i had 56 K not long ago... oh how i hated those days.  Now i have high speed... if i ever had to go bac to 56 K, i would die.  Heh, oh well, its a convenience.  I have been given so much.   Lates
