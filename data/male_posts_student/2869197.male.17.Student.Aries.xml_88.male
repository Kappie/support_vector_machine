This was proven to me today, as I joined Emily, Poonam, Sheshe, Lindsey, and...some other guy for food at a Indo-Chinese restaurant. They had variety to a tee, with 175 different entrees and vittles to choose from. Their "chicken dish" (as I dare not even try to mutilate its name) was delicious and could be eaten on rice or wrapped in naan (bread). I also ordered a drink, that tasted of yogurt and some other flavor I could not pinpoint. Poonam was our guide on this culinary safari, saying this was good or that was tasty. India, I salute you.  A topic that has come up in conversation several times during camp is my desire to gain dreadlocks. Emily doesn't like the idea, but says it is my choice. My mom says that as well. Several girls have voiced the opinion in the negative. All this negative feedbackl, and there is a hair parlor a stone's throw away that could give me my naughty locs. Fear not, mother, I won't partake until after Senior pictures. But I do plan to walk into this parlor sometime during camp, and ask some questions about dreadlocks. I'm quite nervous though, and fear social contact of this sort like the Plague. I shall pray for bravery during adversity.
