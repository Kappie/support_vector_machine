I didn't really do anything special today other than play ping pong for half-an-hour and allow myself to watch at episode of "Enterprise" that I hadn't seen. ["Riot Poof," Tori Amos, 1999]  Oh, there was this former graduate of TCOM that came today to the emergency medicine club meeting to talk about his tactical EMS department in St. George, Missouri. He's a class of '91 guy, but he's a medical director for the medical division of SWAT up there. He gave a very very interesting talk. For quite a while now I've fancied the idea of being an EMS medical director, though I don't really think I'd like being shot at. ["Time Stands Still," The All-American Rejects, 2003]  Since I'm more into public health and health policy issues I imagine that I'd really like to delve into rural prehospital care research when I'm not working in the ED setting. There's just so much goddamn untapped potential in this area. It won't make me any quick money, but it'll make me happy.  ["Till Death Do Us Part," Madonna, 1989]    The UNTHSC White Coat Ceremony is this weekend and I'm really looking forward to it. This is basically a med school ceremony where each entering student is cloaked with the white coat which symbolizes their new committment to medicine and health science. I'm also going to go see "Open Range" this weekend; I'm a very big fan of westerns. ["Southern Man," Neil Young]  That's about all that I can think of. I'm now going to continue studying my patient interviewing rubric and the hellish world of cellular glycolysis. When you thought you had it beat for the MCAT, it returns with a vengence.
