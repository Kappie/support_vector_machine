(sorry guys, i'm going to start using that =P hope you guys don't mind) i put the 8 AMVs in my bag so i can help out a bit with that ^^ is tim bringing any? gahh... this reminds me of the chain reaction it set off. keane announces that it would be AMV week, i felt like bringing some, search "AMV" on kazaa, finds - among others - a really cool naruto one, gets hooked on naruto, downloads cool songs used in AMVs.   downloading the two songs i liked was easy enough... but still have several volumes of naruto to crunch through... i might do that tonight. if not tonight, then summer... can't afford to lose any more time.  oh btw, that title is taken from one of the songs... "bring me to life" from evanescence, mixed with naruto goodness.   ooo... speaking of chain reactions, how about last weeks? ana sama too busy, keane took charge, keane invited jax, jax brought pup, then that incident with kitai. coincidentally, i missed half of anime waiting for kitai ^^;; that was the first time that happened... and everything was set in motion... so cool. seriously, it takes something like that to wake me up, so i'm grateful for pup ^^;; even though he's like "sorry" when i talked to him about it later =P mehhh... i'm going to treat everything as normal, because it  was  normal for them.   kk, s'alll for now! i'm suddenly feeling twice as cheery and productive than i have for the last month... man, whatever happened to cheery being normal? *wants to get back to that state*  ~Chro
