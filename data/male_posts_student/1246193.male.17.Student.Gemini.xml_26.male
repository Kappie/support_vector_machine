I made some new friends and reconnected with a lot of old friends.  I realized that my favorite class is art.  I have to drop it next year.  This isn't a long blog, I just wanted to say thanks to everyone that contributed to my enjoyment this year.  I hope we all have fun next year.  This marks the end of my school year blogs and the beginning of my summer blogs.  Everyone have a great summer!
