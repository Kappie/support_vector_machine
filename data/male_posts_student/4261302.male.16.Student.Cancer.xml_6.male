Something I should write about. Well, where can I start? You've probably heard of Halo, and if you haven't, buy it now. If you can't do that, I feel sorry for you. Anyway. The game is in so many ways the epitome of what a game should be. It's genre is shoot-em-up, mixed with occasional stealth and a fair bit of driving. This includes the beatiful Warthog, THE best vehicle ever created. Think dune buggy Make it the size of a...well, a large car. Cover it with glossy, futuristic armour. Make it open-topped, with roll bars. Finally, stick a huge fat minigun on the end and it's finished. This vehicle can be driven over any terrain, run over any enemy, Survive any falls, and has the most amazing jumps and flips I've ever seen anything do when hit by another Warthog. Endess fun can be had by repeatedly ramming into each other on multiplayer and watching the effects. Its not just about the vehicles though. The AI, while not the best ever created, is damn close. Enemies jump out of the way of grenades, form defenive groups, scatter when things go wrong, and have numerous responses to different situations. Once youv'e heard a grunt cry "Get it off me, someone please get it off me!" whilst running straight towards his comrades with a plasma grenade stuck to his head, you'll want to hear it again and again. The AI is not limited to enemies however. Marines assist you several times through the game (people on your side is something that every game should have), and you get used to their personalities, so realistic do they seem. The funny australian bloke, for example, will react differently to any given situation than, say, the grumpy squad sergeant. Finally the environments are the cherry on the top. There is so much variety, from the beautiful view over the waterfall onto the grassy plains, to the snowy, narrow valleys. This really is a game to treasure, and will be copyed countless times,whih is the highest praise a game can get.
