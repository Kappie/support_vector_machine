Sloth has dug its claws into me, and there's little I can do... I don't even feel like posting... Nothing to say, nothing to express, when I don't have school, I have no feelings. No negative feelings anyway. Computer games make me feel neutral and friends make me feel.... warm and fuzzy inside?! WTF is this?! Wait, nvm...  And this leads me to believe that this is what summer will likely to be... totally, completely, and absolutely meaningless and empty. So much so that I will likely come out of it in such a vulnerable state that my first semester depression period is likely to repeat... WAHH! I don't want that to happen...  Y didn't plan out my summer properly :(. I have no job, no summer school, no vulenteer program planned.... no computer camp, no army training camp,no CS LAN parties.... no internet caf√© package, no computer upgrades, no VB projects, or that of any kind... no new endeavers, no plans of any kind, and definately nothing interesting... I can c myself for the whole summer right now... In front of a computer screen, going to the washroom once in awhile to cry about sucking at online games so much, then giong to bed for a few hours nap, before getting up for the rest of the NIGHT to keep playing with people who live in China and are enjoying their DAY. Pathetic... I no.  But what can I do... I can't shake myself loose of Sloth... she is evil and she clings... her fingers around my throat, her nails dug into my heart... she clings to me life, she does. Gluttony's got me too... colourful food, tasty food, wonderful food... food aplenty, eat to me heart's content, beyond what me body needs or wants... If he had to, he'd taken me from the stomach, or maybe the kidneys or the liver... I got my dealings with the others too... Pride's in my veins and I damn can't shake him off, afterall, I'll boast till I go hypovolemic. You can c Greed in my eyes. He darts here and there, telling me to take what I can. As for what I can't..., he leaves it to Envy, bet u'd be able to c me complexion turn to a sinner's green... And Lust... she stays in my pants, no? I do hope she does, cause jail's an unpleasant place... That and that she clips her nails... If u no what I mean. Now, if someone tries to take me from me earthly pleasures and earthly sins, Wrath be upon 'em... Me Warth ain't something to recconed with. He be raw and he be vicious, and he plays dirty too...  Now... Do u have an idea what I have to deal with? I take upon my daily sins like another takes up his daily bread. I got not guilt, either. They say the seven deadly sins trips those who seek spirititual salvation and takes 'em up on the route of spiritual damnation... Like I give a damn. Humans cannot exist without earthly pleasures and earthly sins, and I certaingly cannot exist without them. But noooooo, society tells us to feel guilty. Let me tell u, let Guilt be the eighth deadly sin. He'll be among friends.  I refuse to conform, but does that mean I'm rebelling? Really though, who the  orange juice  gives a  peanut butter and jelly sandwich ?!
