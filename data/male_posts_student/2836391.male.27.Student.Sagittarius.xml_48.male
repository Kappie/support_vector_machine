I prefer to be busy, than to have nothing to do, but sometimes I find that the days get just a little bit  too  busy!   urlLink Rachel's  post the other day regarding memories got me thinking a bit. I started to think about the person I was when I was younger, the personality I had, and what was important to me then. I found that I was a very different person then than I am now. I guess that is to be expected, that I would change as I grew older.  While I was doing this thinking, and realizing how I had changed, I started to think about what were the things that had caused me to change. At college at the moment I am studying development, how we learn, and what makes us who we are, and I guess a natural extension of this is that I would start to think about what has made me me.  One of the things I have found as I have examined myself is that I always try to see the good in others. I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt, and maybe trust people a bit more easily than I should. When you are young I think it is easier to do that, because you don't have the experience of trust being broken. As I got older, I found that sometimes people you trust can hurt you, not always intentionally, but hurt you just the same.  Eventually I came to the conclusion that the only people who can betray your trust, are the people you trust. With that knowledge, comes a dilemma. I can not trust anyone, in order to protect my emotions, and in doing so not live life to the full, or I can continue to trust people, and, sometimes, get hurt.  While there are times when I feel as though I would like to shut myself away from the world, and keep my feelings locked up in a box where no one can get at me, I know that that is not really an option. If I am to experience all that life has to offer, then part of that deal is going to be the odd hurt. The question therefore, is how to deal with that hurt, as and when it comes along.  More musings tomorrow.....
