So I'll combine yesterday and today's posts all into one compact one. Well yesterday, I got up, and then went to school. I already wrote about my test in a post before this, I think. Sorry if I didn't it, but I'm not writing it again, just because I'm lazy, sorry. Well after my test I came home and really did nothing. I really didn't do anything to later on that day. But around 7:00 I went over to Splashdown, because my ortho, Dr. Arkwell, rented it out. Well it's only been like 68 degrees out lately. And this is in late June. How stupid is that, it's summer and its not even hot. So I didn't swim, I just got the free food they give out. I got some nachos and a powerade. Then I was in the car and Brian and Melissa called and asked if I wanted to watch 50 First Dates with them. So they came over and we stuck it in and we watched it. I had already seen it before, but it was still a good movie. I really like Adam Sandler, he is really funny. So we watched it and then hung out after and then they left. Then I just got online and really did nothing. Then I went to bed and got up today. Me and my parents got into a fight which really put a damper on my day. I asked to do something about three months ago. And they said no. But then about 2 days ago my sister and asked they had no problem with it. So wow was there yelling. Hopefully I get to go with my sister though. But then after all that I really had nothing to do. At around 1:00 my nieghboors who moved here from Massachusetts. They brought like 17 live lobsters back, and like Clams, and all this. And made fresh new England Chowder. Well, I'm not really into seafood. I like crab legs and thats about it. And then there were no kids there under 23. So, yeah. I didn't stay long. I went home and just sat and did nothing. I have been really bored lately, me and Kyle can't ride are bike to K-Mart anymore which is making me sad. He just needs a new leg right now! Right now! Well since he isn't in shape to ride, I have turned to my alternate material. MTV's the Real World. Now I'm not really the person who watches that much MTV, let alone TV. But The Real World is really growing on me. I know some of the people are there that just want to get a start in Hollywood. But then some are actually living it out for real. And it is unscripted which is cool, so its random. But I have been watching the marathon of the San Diego one, and I have been watching it for about 2 and a half hours. I just can't stop. Well I can and I did for a little because I went outside and played basketball with my brother for about a half an hour. But I have been watching a lot of The Real World. I also was downloading an album and the stupid leechers on bittorent screwed me over. I was on 99.65% and it stopped. And there were no more seeds for over 6 hours. I had uploaded over 300MB to other people in seeds, but no seeds out of 114 people for my album. So after I let it kill my connection for about 6 hours I just said screw it and canceled it. But I was mad. Stupid 99.65%! Well back to the Real World! Later!
