If anyone is against gay marriage, than please, donâ€™t marry someone of your own gender.  Why can't we just live our own lives, instead of trying to control every one else?  If people just focused on their own morals, instead of trying to force everyone else to think how they do, than the world would be a much better place.  ~Joseph
