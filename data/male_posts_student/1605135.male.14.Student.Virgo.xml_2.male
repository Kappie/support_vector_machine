You see, HSAs (High School Assesments) are all this week.  They're huge, insanely easy, state-mandated tests that take up the first three hours of every day this week.  If you don't have a test, you either come in three hours late or have to find some way to entertain yourself at school.  Today was the Geometry test, which I already took last year.  I couldn't get in at 10:40, so I was stuck there for three hours.  I ended up doing a lot of chemistry homework and just messing around online in the computer lab.  After the period was up it was a fairly normal day, with Spanish then lunch then half-periods of gym and chemistry, and then English.  In chemistry Mr. Pham gave us a take home quiz, saying he is "expecting all students will do this quiz by themselves - without obtaining assistance from any sources" even though the point is to review for the final.  How can we review when we're not allowed to look at our notes?  Well, I'm off to the chat room to do the quiz.  Until next time.
