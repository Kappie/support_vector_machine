My dad and I are staying home while my brother and mom are at a family reunion... I said i didn't want to go because my legs hurt(which they do), but its more because I feel uncomfortable around my family... what with them all being devout christian and such.  I keep feeling proud of meself every morning when I refuse to do the pledges at school... before i was pretending like i was doing it, but ive just decided to say "fuck em" and just stand up. I'll stand, because I know i'll be sitting for another hour and a half, but i dont say shit. And I take it upon myself to have a "coughing attack" during the Minute of Silence.  I just learned that computer games are being used to treat phobias. They used Max Payne to create tight spaces, heights, and spider-filled areas for people with claustrophobia, fear of heights, and arachnophobia, and tested them out- they worked. Cool.
