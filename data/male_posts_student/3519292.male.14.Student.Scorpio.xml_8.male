Wow star wars rocked.You don't need to make a damn religion out of a  movie.Same thing for those star trek assholes.I swear to god I'm  walking down the street and these star trek retards dressed in these "Star trek fan" shirts come walking down the street.These kids have  pimples and fat everywhere.I mean come on i'm 14 and I could kick  thier little fat star trek asses up and down the street.Don't be  gay and join some D and D cult either.That's even worse.Board game's  suck ass.
