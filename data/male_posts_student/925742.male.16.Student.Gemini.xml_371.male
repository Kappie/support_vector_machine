Then I watched some of the Young and the Restless, which is the best soap opera in the history of.... soap... operas.  I decided against showering this morning, as is the custom when I had to leave the house quickly.  Me and my dad went out (we got some tacos, since he was hungry) and then went to Best Buy to see if my PDA could be repaired under warranty.  Nope!  So, Alex Apostol, you were right.    I guess it would be cheaper to get that sexy E405 in spring.  Hmmmmmm.  I tried testing stuff out, but Quake, GXmark, and FPSEce did not want to work.  Eh.  Whatever.  Then I waited around in the hospital for my dad to finish seeing some patient.  I played PocketEQ in the lounge.  Yeah, I said I was done with EQ for computer, but not PDAs!  Hee hee.  When I got home I decided to take a nap and I was asleep for about and hour when I was awoken by a call.  I'm kinda let down I couldn't come over, but I'll live.  Eh, thats what relationships are about, a little give, a little take, a little surprise.  I get my hopes up too much in my naivety.  I'm clingy.  Its the way I think; like I won't find someone who is better than you.  I don't want to let go, so I seize up the chance to be with you.  Is that a bad thing?  I could stand some room for improvement, heh.  Please tell me.  I guess I'll stay here.  And maybe play some NwN. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Love.  What is it?  I don't know.  I'd bet that no one  knows  what it is.  Oh, people can speculate, make little questionnaires, create hypothetical situations, analyze what you may do when you are around that certain someone, but its all just that: speculation.  I agree in the sense that love is made in the reaction.  How you think after something (or if you even change), or what you may do can make or break a relationship.  In the end, if there are differences, talking about them and working them out can lead to a stronger bond.  But again... love, who knows, right?  Its many things, and I believe that if someone tries to actually say what it IS, then they deserve to be chain punched in the face.  So thats why I may not say it..... I'm not sure what it is, or if I feel it, or if I am ready, or blah blah blah. Also I don't want to scare you.  Wow I'm being open.  Eh.
