I ate roti prata, Mother ate Mee Soto. Anyhoo, at Shop N Save, a Cold Storage supervisor came to inspect the cashier. She chose to inspect Lao Yao Guai's register, check the account and everything. HaHa. Anyhoo, we brought things.   We came back at 10.30, I went online for a while. Dad called and we went down to go to the hospital. We are going early because of parking space. Even so, it was 11.35 when we reached there and it was kind hard to find a parking space.   Hmm. After going through the registration and stuff, we met MaMa's (no, it doens't mean Mother. It means Grandma. My way of calling her) friends in the lobby. Dai Gu Ma and Yee Pak Pak joined us later. Hmm..We sat around till 12, when we went in to look at MaMa.   Hmm. She's looking pretty frail. She hasn't had her operation yet. The doctor's checking her blood, see whether it will be suitable or not. Her blood pressure is mild lor. Anyway, she refused to eat her lunch. I can see why. It smells horrible! The greens are mashed till very watery, the rice is very runny...very horrible smell. Anyway, she drank some Milo lor. It's kinda depressing, really.   Anyhoo, we and DGM are going to the Loyang first. They want to go there to pray for some 4D number. Yeah. We went to eat lunch first. DGM ate already, so all of us ate kueh chap. They were discussing about MaMa, her health, Dai Pak Pak and his stupidity (for calling DGM unfilial...long story, don't wanna say). Aynhoo, we went to the temple lor. We prayed for good luck, Mother brought some good-luick amulet, which I am not brining with me.   After that, Father drove me to the beach, which is very near Loyang. I found them. Okie. They were playing cards/games, then, they decided to rent bikes. The shop-owner very lame leh. Tell us lotsa lame jokes and riddles before letting us rent bikes. We rode around and around. We rested a bit. We went to play at the playground (had so much fun! :D), and even sat down to watch the sea. After that, I went alone to ride bike (and catch up with WQ, KS and Gloria, which I never did). It was a very cool expeience.Just riding and riding. I circled Pasir Ris Park twice. Heh Heh. I thought a lot of crazy thoughts....and I let myself go wild with the wind. Shuang! After giving back the bikes, we milled around, taking photos and playing games till 6+.  We then went to eat at White Sands' McDonalds. HaHa. XC copied nearly all of my contacts into his phone. Meow moo meow! I ate Chicken McNuggets Meal, XC too. I ordered for him ma. :P After that, we started on our journey home. XC and KS alighted at Yishun to find Hann, who is letting KS and XC stay over. Me, Gloria and KK walked home together.  Okay. Sorry if it all sounded very short and simplified. Tomorrow's the release of Os results. I am very very nervous (I am somewhat more calmed down then when I've started). What if I do badly? I don't even want to think. I just know that I am very very nervous. Very jing zhang. God. I can't wait for tomorrow, so I can meet my friends. Being with them makes me more calm and serene. When I'm alone, I tend to hu shi ruan xiang. Think wild thoughts. Stupid. I shouldn't think more. AHHHHHH!  Okay...calm down. I think I go liao la...see ya tomorrow. Night blog!
