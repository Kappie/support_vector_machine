       
      Well due to a SNAFU in the scheme of things. I won't be starting classes until Wednesday.  "Why?" you ask.  Because I have a hold on my records that won't allow me to register for classes, and the person I need to contact about it has been in meetings all day today, I would've started tomorrow, but that won't happen because I'm not registered for classes.  If I didn't want to be done with school with something to show for it so badly, I'd just stop and hit the road with all the skills I'm going to learn about my profession at EKU.  I have no more major classes, all GEN ED.  Health Class, Literature Classes, Biology... CRAP CRAP CRAP!  I'm almost out of school, and I don't have any debt (which is a very big accomplishment in this day and age) and I want to get to the living my life part.  It's all very frustrating.  Stupid 20/20 hindsight.
