I'm currently reading a book called Eragon. If you've never heard of it, this 497 pages book (509 if you consider the language guide, and author's notes) is about non other than Eragon. Wow! don't know how you guessed. To cut it short, he finds a stone; the stone becomes a dragon hatchling; he and his dragon leave. That's pretty much it. It's a series of 3 and just came out, actually, if you read the back of the book, it came out about 2 years ago, but that's a long story. At least I think I got it right.  I'm on 413 right now, however if I wasn't typing to you to make up lost time, then I'd be closer to the end, and wating for the second book to be published. So, off I go, have fun.
