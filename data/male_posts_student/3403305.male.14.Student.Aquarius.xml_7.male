I've been puking for some reason, I never get sick this time of the year. Worst part about that, is yesterday, I started to puke up blood. At least I think it was blood, I mean, I don't drink any redish fluids. Today my dad forced me to go to a cook-out somewhere I've never been. I love my dad, but sometimes he pisses me off so badly.............He kept calling me gay in front of my family because I'm always wearing these two bracelets Bobbie gave me. Hopefully Bobbie can come over on Monday, I miss her so much. I started pushing my hair out of my face, now it looks somewhat good. Did I say I miss Bobbie yet, I did, well I'll say it again. I miss Bobbie a lot.  That's most of the pain I'm going through right now. I'm going into detail on the rest, I'm just going to say if you knew it, you'd probably need a theripist. If Bobbie calls me tomorrow, she said she would, I have trust in her. I'm going to read this to her over the phone, damn, in order to print it out, I need to put more paper in the printer, but I'm too lazy to get up. I always get off the computer when I'm on the phone, I don't know why. My dad is rushing me off the computer. So bleh, it was a long post. I'll try to do it again sometime...:P   ~_~I am the one who waits, I am the one who is here, I am the one that will always be~_~
