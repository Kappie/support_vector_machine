The black guy won ( forgot his name), and my housemates were saying it is expected.   Serene passed her driving test. yah!!! Congrats fromfellow housemates ofof 2/50 Durham Street. So far so good for me, decided to drop one of the modules. So i will be takng only 5 modules here (1 more than normal load), rather than 6.   Tutorials are rolling in and so will be getting busier. Cooked chicken rice, didn't turn out as expected but still nice. Today chefs are Michelle and me. I think i will be cooking for Mondays or Tuesday because i am more free on those days.   Anyway, i have uploaded some photos, go urlLink Holiday At Brisbane Will be uploading more in the future.   Ok, going to have dinner now, wish that all is well back home.  EngTat
