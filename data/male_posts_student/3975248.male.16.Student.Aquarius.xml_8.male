I'm curious to know what your favorite types of movies are. My favorite types would have to be scary/suspenseful and comedy. There's something about scary movies that catches my attention. I guess I just like being on the edge of my seat. Secondly, I love comedies. I always enjoy having a good laugh. Let me know what your favorites are.... could be one, two, or three, or however many you like! Thanks to those who have given feedback, I hope to hear from more of you.
