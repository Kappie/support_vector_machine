So far, we've had very little in the way of active discussion about things.  Is it because of the topics?  Are people not interested?  What can we do to get more action here??  I mentioned a few weeks back that I was looking for ways to get more people involved, and I'm no closer to an idea.  Anyone else have some thoughts?    Help me make this a better site.  Give me ideas.
