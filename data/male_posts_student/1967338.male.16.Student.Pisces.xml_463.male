The fact that I remember middle school so vaguely is worrying to me.  I think I may be going senile early.  I've decided that I need a feature, like fanfic recommendations or match-ups.  So to celebrate election year, I'm having our vary own Compendium of Stupidity election simulator.  Since we have so few people, I'm letting everyone vote in both primaries.  First the Republican primary.  The candidates are:   George W. Bush Bill Gates Senator Palpatine The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra!  Cast your votes in your next post.  Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...
