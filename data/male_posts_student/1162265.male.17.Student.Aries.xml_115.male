I felt physically sick when the Nets started to lose their lead, and knew I couldn't sleep unless I either saw them win or stopped watching the game. Well, being the wuss I am, I saw them blow a 5 point lead and go 8 in debt..... So I decided I'll just watch hockey tommorow.  I can deal with the Devils losing.  They've already had a cup.    Anyway.... You can go back to your little reality now.
