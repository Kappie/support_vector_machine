Working on commenting stuff still but that won't take me to much longer so just bear with me for a day.  This site should look good on everyone's comp but if it doesn't send me an email.  Still working on my profile and getting reid of the kinky too.  Not really in the mood to talk so I'll keep this short and head to bed. Expect more frequent posts, shorter more frequent posts and stuff. Enjoy and tell me what you think.
