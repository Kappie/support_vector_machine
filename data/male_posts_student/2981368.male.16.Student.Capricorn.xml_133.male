Wayne Rooney (youngest player to ever score in a European championship) got 2, one a great header from a Michael Owen cross, the other a great shot which bounced off the post, into the keeper, and back into the net. The match was rounded off by a really well taken shot by Steven Gerrard.  In other Euro 2004 news:  -France and Croatia play soon..like...in 2 minutes. It'd actually help if France won that, I think. -Portugal look like they might just survive after beating Russia 2-0. -I reckon Sweden will top their group after a 5-0 rout of Bulgaria. -And much more I'll post later. Must go watch the France game now.  Oh, but first: meet "World Cup Willie", the mascot from the World Cup in 1966!     What. A. Legend.  Oh, and...COME ON ENGLAND!!!
