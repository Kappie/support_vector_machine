But YES, she was still on, wonder what is the time she finish CNA work everyday, oh well.. CNA reported about tis baby named Jakob, makes me feel kinda upset, haiz.. See my prev posting for more info..   Going to work in a heavy feeling, but after putting up with the nonsense by the kids, i totally forgot about everyting. Only when its break time, i felt so upset about the whole Jakob thingy, i blogged.. Haha  I re-discovered one thing today, the girls are always the one writing up the presentation scripts and taking school work seriously.. The boys only play and dun do anyting.. I was totally pissed off, and i gave them a good scolding.. Haiz but im sure their form teacher had scolded them countless times, but they just wont listen! Haiz! Tinking back of my pri sch days, its quite true, im the playful one, and the girls are more hardworking, haha the art of hormones...   There's a new stunt by the pri sch boys, they bought those round-head pins and poke themselves in the arm to form a line or shape. Their form teacher asked them to stay back and i dont know what happened later.. Do u believe the tings they do now! I tink its their version of tattoo, really, i was like WTF...     The New Tattoo tool has arrived..  My colleague told me that the super "Lork Cork" kopitiam sells really good noodles, went to try it out, and its really TAT good! Most important of all, its only 2dollars, and the serving was quite big... Im saving lots of money eating at the school canteen already and the kopitiam noodles is so cheap! OMG! All the money saving stunts i learnt! Felt "cheap" today! haha     YEA BABY! Stretch TAT DOLLAR!  Oh well, today's meeting got postpone till tomolo, YES! Tomolo im off, got to go SIM for some orientation thingy, so i dont have to put up with watever nonsense the teacher is gonna say, but i do feel bad for my colleague...  One bad ting, tomolo got to reach SIM by 8am! Im living in Serangoon! SHIT! Got to wake up at 6plus! DAMN!  Sleep time soon, got to wake up early, haiz.. Sad.. Support my friends' blogs will ya!
