You wont let me inside why cant these feelings for you subside in my mind. these butterflies and nervous feelings have a hold on me without talking to you i'll probably never be free. tell what you feel inside i just want to know if there will be a time time that is left is rapidly diminishing for the light i give you might not be there again.  When I can Look into your eyes And see only what used to be, I know that what I felt for you is lost and will never come back to me. When my only memories of you Are reveries of pain and sorrow, I know now that you are gone and lonely days will follow. When I look at your picture on the wall With Confusion and uncertainty, I know that something went wrong With all that was meant for you and me. When all I can think about is how you left without a reason, And how you don't remember me now Is nothing like the season Of love we had and how I cant deal with what I have to Live with forever... Is this The End?
