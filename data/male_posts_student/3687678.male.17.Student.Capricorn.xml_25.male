Jobs sent a companywide e-mail from his hospital bed on a 17-inch Powerbook stating that he had a rare form of cancer that is much more curable than pancreatic cancer.  Jobs goes on to say that he will take August off to recover but will return in September.  He has appointed executive vice president Tim Cook to be in charge while Jobs is out for the month.   urlLink View CNET News Article
