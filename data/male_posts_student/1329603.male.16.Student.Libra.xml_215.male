Was dancing around on stage a bit, sang well, the music was brilliant and the audience were exceeding words in how good they were. I'm going to spend an hour telling you about the people surrounding the best performance of my life.  First off, I need to point this out before anything else: Segye, Shez, Nick and Jo all rule so much that even the Queen still has to write "If you in your infinite wisdom would grant me this priveledge" to them. About 4 rehearsals with me and we put on a performance better than I've done with a year's practice with other people. Just... oh my... seriously. I got to hug all of the band members, and that was cool, and I really want to steal Nick and Jo and put them in a box as my pretties. ^_^ Then I'd have pretties ^_^.  I said "Hi Brendan!" to Brendan. You know, there's not a lot to say on the subject. I said hi. He said hi back. *sniffs* It was so special...  *cries with joy* I saw Laura, I saw Laura ^_^. She gave me some nice looks when I was on stage. *dances* Unfortunately, I talked to her not so much... *cries* but still, yay, hugged her 3 times, managed to resist any jumping on and/or kissing her things, so that's all in good fun. I saw Fi too, with her hair and her leg-covering things. Which was quite cool. Oh, and I've [finally] met Nikky! First meeting in person went like this...  Hi Jon!   He!...llo....   You do know who I am, yeah?   Of course... *blank look*   From the internet?   ....int...!! OH!!! NIKKY!!! *big big hug*  Aw, she rules. Ging is superb as a guitarist, possibly the best that has ever wandered into my vision. Well done him. Lisa and Zoe and Patrick... and Digby and Sarah were also there, and they were all super-nice. Patrick was so ecstatic when he hugged me that he knocked my jaw out. Couldn't move it properly for a bit. Ouch.  Saw Jack (Javert) there, he was lighting-helping, and doing a good job of it. He was well pleased, I think. He seemed it, anyway. I also saw Liz, his sister, who I think pulled some of my hair out or something because I felt a yank and then turned round and saw her running away from me, so... but still, I'll find out on Saturday what she thought. No I won't. CAYO's not on on Saturday. Ah. But still.  Tobin and Libby were there, I got hugs from both of 'em... yay! When I come to think of it, all of the hugs were for a bare-chested Jon... wow, Jon was not only sexy but he was huggable, too. Libby was ecstatic, and Tobin was very pleased. Tobin said I'd "done him proud" and Libby broke her voice crying "You ruled!" when she went to hug me. Jon's pleased with that. I made a woman break her voice. ^_^.  Rhi was there! Talked to her for about 45 minutes about everything or nothing, was quite cool. She was looking really lonely, so I talked to her for a bit, and it was quite cool...  A woman borrowed my lipstick. Seriously. A woman asked if she could borrow my lipstick, and she did. I can forever keep in my heart that a woman borrowed my lipstick.  Buzzy ruled. He was the king of the drums. He bust they ass. No, but seriously, Buzzy ruled.  Now for possibly the ultimate in things that are so cool it doesn't make much sense. While I was singing, my gaze was caught by a woman who was watching particularly intently, perhaps slightly quizzically. I noticed a light of recognition burst in her eyes and she almost fell over with shock, shouting "Oh My God" loud enough to hear over the loudish music. I spent the majority of the set trying to work out who she was - this won't mean a lot to you so I'll explain it step by step. I met a woman on the French exchange, Sophie Wilcox, who I liked and perhaps fancied a bit but I was with Sam at the time so I got on well with her and that was that (subtle hint in that MYSELF, I managed to resist the temptation to cheat). We got quite closish on the internet, and she confided things with me about her relationship with her boyfriend (Martin, started going out with him shortly after the exchange). Anyway, her internet broke and she hasn't been able to get on for a year and a half, just about. The woman who was so shocked at seeing me was Sophie, and such an amazing coincidence it was because, although she goes to Pates, she didn't know that I could sing. She must have one amazing memory to recognise someone she knew with short hair and glasses to be someone with long hair and lipstick, with no glasses. I'm so glad she did though, because being me I would never have recognised her, I think. That's probably the last time I'll ever see her. She gave me a couple of big hugs, was Ã¼ber-friendly and in general was cool. Love you, Sophie.  Laura, Fi, Nikky, Tobin and Libby have all seen but one aspect of my performance skills. Laura says she likes performers, so I hope that she'll like me in the very contrasting role of Marius in Les Mis. It's A Heart Full of Love v. Suck My Kiss for today. *bows and runs off*  Quote for today: "At least I have her love, The city, she loves me. Lonely as I am Together we cry."
