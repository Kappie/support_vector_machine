It stands for It's The End and MacPherson is pronounced as "Mad Person". So when you combine those words together, it becomes "It's The End Mad Person". Yeah, it's the end for me studying in this school.  And there really is a mad person in our school who likes going around shouting "Hoo...." to anyone he picked up randomly, I think he's been surfing too much Yahoo. He's so famous that almost all students know him even the toilet cleaners. His favorite hangout is at the school library, and his favorite cartoon is Pokemon. Because of that, we have to accompany him watching Pokemon. Really, I am speaking of facts here. I don't fabricate lies as Xiexue usually does. You can ask any student in my school, they will tell you.  Enough of that, I am gonna tell you what I had learnt in my course, as the name implies, this course deals with everything got to do with Multimedia, in the first year, they taught me how to design a pornographic webpage and then host it on the Internet. This year they are gonna teach me using Flash to do pornographic animated website and then shoot a few porn video and do some video-editing.  This is pretty cool, huh? But I got a B for my Internet Fundamental last semester, perhaps my site lacks of obscene photos and hence not erotic enough to arouse the teacher. Well, this time I am gonna do it better.  Every now and then, I have been thinking how misfortunate I am to be in MMT2J, a class full of insane girls and nuts. Imagine there's a high pitch scream out of a sudden and you thought a girl was being raped, but she was molested by another same species. Yes, lesbians rule the class.  This leads me to suspect Xiaxue is also a lesbian, because she's so highly sex-minded. She even designed her own pornographic website, which my classmates and I visited in school. Don't get me wrong, it's because she claimed that it's not pornographic so I thought I could just check it out anyway. Never did I know she will resort to this "Bu Zhe Shou Duan" (a Chinese idiom describing a person using despicable ways and means to accomplish their goal) method to increase the hits on her website. What a SIN to make use of human nature and weakness! She deserves to be executed.  Ok, that's all of my school life I will write for now. *Phew*
