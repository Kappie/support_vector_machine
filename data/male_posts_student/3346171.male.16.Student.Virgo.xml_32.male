(Malgaxe say)  It's so true, today at school, the geography teacher spent 50 minutes talking about the "waiste of water in today's world", i guess he didn't need to take all the time, i know it is an important subject, but come on.  Thank God the dificult tests are gone, but i'll sitll do: gramatic, geo, bio and history.   Here in Brazil, the lottery is acumulated in R$ 35 million, Jeses, if my dad wins it... I really don't know what to do, i really don't. I would help some people in Africa, travel, buy a house of chocolate, a pool of milk-shake of pineaple, definetly that would be awesome! Well, untill there let's wait, maybe someday i get that.  Who am i lying to?
