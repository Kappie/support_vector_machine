In spite the way you were mocking me, Acting like i was part of your property, Remembering all the times you fought with me, I'm surprised it got so far, Things aren't the way they were before, You wouldn't even recognize me anymore, Not that you knew me back then, But it all comes back to me, In the end...You kept everything inside, And even know i tried it all fell apart, What it meant to me, will, Eventually, be a memory of a time when, I tried so hard and got so far, But in the end, It doesn't even matter, I had to fall, To lose it all, But in the end, It doesn't even matter, I've put my trust in you, Pushed as far as I can go, For all this, There's only one thing you should know, I've put my trust in you, Pushed as far as i can go, For all this, There's only one thing you should know... I tried so hard and got so far, But in the end, It doesn't even matter, I had to fall, To lose it all, But in the end, It doesn't even matter
