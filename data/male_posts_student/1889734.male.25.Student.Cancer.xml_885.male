I still don't think Steve buys into it though...    "Regardless of the purpose, such behavior is immoral. It's a reduced form of slavery. After all, what is the essence of slavery? It's the forceful use of one person to serve the purposes of another person.   When Congress, through the tax code, takes the earnings of one person and turns around to give them to another person in the forms of prescription drugs, Social Security, food stamps, farm subsidies or airline bailouts, it is forcibly using one person to serve the purposes of another. "   Hard to argue with the premise.
