Anyway, my point is that I'd only get my ear pierced, and even then only on one side (probably left, just because; or maybe right... damn). Today while rummaging around the house because Mom is at work and Josh is at a friends house until tomorrow, I found some little gold round thing that looks like it came from one of Josh's toys or something of Mom's. Turns out that I can pry it open, sand the edges down with a file, and wear the thing as if I had a little gold earring. Fun stuff. It actually looks pretty cool and no pain or self-mutilation involved! All I have to do know is remember to take it off when Mom's around or the family is near, I don't think any of them would take to well to that. But it is one good way of sneakily coming out to all of them.
