Big eal if your child is exposed to nudeity/porn there going to one day and its better to find information about that from your parents than from some teacher you hardly know i mean come on parents get real you cant protect your children for their whole lives i mean practicly any search engine that has image search is a porn site.   so i thought i would talk about something differnt in this post and not delve in to the psyche of my life i mean if you want to hear about twisted things from my life then yay me. but if you dont like what i write about then dont read its totally up to you this is just a place i can let all my thoughts out and and just a place for me to hang.  but i must admit i am enjoying posting my thoughts i dont know why but i am who knows i might continue to do this for a long time.  well i think thats enough typing/writing for one day and i say good night to you all.
