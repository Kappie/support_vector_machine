That meant that I didn't get to lunch until 3:00 PM since I had to shower and make my lunch. At least I managed to back up some of my files on CD,   urlLink upload pics  , and take out the trash. At least I managed to get a page of writing done last night (after hours of playing Civ III though). I have a lot of work I need to get done in the next week. I have to write about 11 more pages for my art history class and 5 for my sociology class by next Monday. Lovely huh?  In other news... apparently Brand New is going to be playing here in Binghamton in a few weeks. I should really read the school paper and keep aware of what goes on campus. I actually got news of this from Becky, who doesn't even go to school here (although she is friends with Melissa who does go here) Anyway... I'm still annoyed that I didn't get to hear Greg Graffin of Bad Religion talk here last year. I need to keep up with stuff in Binghamton.  Speaking of shows... I still don't know which date of the Bouncing Souls, Randy, and Avail show that I want to go to. I've already seen the Bouncing Souls and Avail, but I've never seen Randy. They're a band I really want to see. I find their Marxist lyrics humorous. So... 5/5 in Buffao, 5/6 in New York, or 5/7 in Philadelphia?  In a more political vein... I don't see how people could not have forseen this sort of thing going into war. Pro-war people were talking about how easy it would be to topple Saddam Hussein's government, but those same people didn't think about how complicated the situation would be following Saddam's defeat. I don't see how the Bush Administration with billions of dollars of intelligence research didn't realize that occupying a nation is difficult stuff (especially in a region of the world that hates Americans).  ***
