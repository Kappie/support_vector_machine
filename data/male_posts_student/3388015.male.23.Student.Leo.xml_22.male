Watched TV for awhile and now I'm off to go furniture shopping for the new apartment.  I got a really nice shelf from Crosby that somebody left behind.  It's great quality.  Now to find some other nice stuff.  I haven't planned what the new place will look like, but I definately want it to look more home-like than dorm-like.  So I'm off.  I'm picking Cindy up around 4:30 to come back to Brockport to watch Shrek 2.  That should be fun.  Maybe we'll do Taco Bell again.
