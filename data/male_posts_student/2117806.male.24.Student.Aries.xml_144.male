They told me, in no uncertain terms, that I was not accepted.  That just really sorta takes the cake, y'know?  Funny thing is, I'm not really upset right now.  I don't feel sorry for myself.  I'm not mad, not sad, nothing.  I mostly just feel...empty, numb, distant.  Like this is all happening to someone else, and I'm just watching from the outside, a passive viewer, a spectator in my own life.  I'm sure this'll change in the next day or two, but for now, I don't feel anything about it.  I don't really want anyone's pity or sympathy, either.  I've already had my fill of it from my parents and grandmother.  It's not that I don't appreciate their comfort or their love, just that...I don't want to think about it right now.  Not at all.  It frustrates me more than I can possibly express using words, but right now, I'm gonna ignore it.  Like I said, I don't feel sorry for myself, I don't feel cheated, I don't feel that I could have done any better than I did, or done things any different than I did.  Mostly, I just feel defeated.  Something else will come up, I'm sure--but for right now, at this moment, I'm not thinking about any of that.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: U2, "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"
