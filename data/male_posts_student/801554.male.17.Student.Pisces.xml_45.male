On an interesting note, alt.fan.douglas-adams is putting on an interesting performance to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the broadcast of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy on March 8th: We are going to perform the whole show. I'm playing the Barman and Zaphod.  If you have access to an NNTP server, check it out.  Otherwise, my life has been abnormally dull as of late, hopefully it will pick up and I can write something interesting.  I should have some book reviews up some time soon, though.
