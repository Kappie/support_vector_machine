Computer illiterate Susan finally figured out how to do a little bit of this junk! yay for me! as for the candidates, I could honestly careless. I have never been very involved in the presidential elections so I find absutlutely no reason to start now, I can't even vote assumig that even then I'd know anything about politics. Social Studies is definenly not one of my strongest points but as little as I know, the Bushman doesn't seem to have made very good decisions for the past four years. With that in consideration one must wonder if he had some intellectual awakening since his last disasterous term. Kerry, in my opionion would be an interesting president. I can't imagine what the political cartoons would look like. Actually, I'm kind of looking forward to seeing one if he should be the winner. I am not a Democrat and I hate to call myself a Republican when I don't keep track of things, as I have said before. All I would have to say to the winner, is good luck pleasing Americans...they get angry if spilled coffee burn them, as if there was any other way to drink coffee.
Reid out.
