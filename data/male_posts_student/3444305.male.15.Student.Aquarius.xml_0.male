It's very unlikely yes, but it could! Shut up! I know I'm crazy! But! We need to conserve energy. Especially things that pollute because that's just nasty. So, don't by SUVs people! By the Toyota Preus that is sitting on the lot just waiting to be used. Just think too! If you have an hybrid, less gas money! It's crazy, saving money and your lungs at the same time! I know it sounds impossible but its not! Also turn the stupid light off when you leave a room, and shut the water off when you aren't using it. It's just that easy people, it's just that easy. Me and Aimee went and saw this movie tonight, and I think everyone should. Because they need see what they are doing to this world. So conserve energy! Alright, I am officially the biggest loser in the world. But who cares! We need to say the world!
