I went to my orthodontist on Wednesday, but I can't remember when I went to my dentist last. If I can't remember that probably means I'll be getting one of those cards in the mail soon...  3. ...filled your gas tank?  Filled MY gas tank? Never, don't have a car. Filled the family's gas tank, last week some time. Tuesday I think.  4. ...got enough sleep?  Last night. Got to sleep in today.  5. ...backed up your computer?   I don't do that. Should I?
