If divine endorsement doesn’t convince you Dan fans, let’s just say the devil made me do it.  Before being giving the unique opportunity to appear in my brother’s blog, my fraternal unit told me that this article must fulfill one of three requirements. It must be –  1. Blazingly funny. 2. Bitingly sarcastic. Or, 3. Incredibly demeaning to our current Commander-In-Chief, the honorable George "Dubya" Bush.  Knowing that I would fail miserably if I tried to imitate Dan’s bone-dry cynicism or dogmatic liberalism (which is, quite frankly, inimitable), I first attempted to write a humor piece, much like the ones I do for the NYU publication, The Plague. I quickly realized, however, that although my massive compendium of fart and anal sex jokes may occupy the upper echelons of all that is humorous, I unfortunately do not have the writing talents to accurately capture the intricacies of aforementioned subject matter.  Therefore, I apologize, Dan, for failing miserably to fulfill any of your blog’s requirements, and will commence to ramble on in my usual, insecure, neurotic way as I do in my secret journals. (Which, of course, do not exist.) (Or do they?) (Duh duh dummm….)  With regards to writing, two thoughts have been occupying my mind lately. Poker and the huge gash on my right foot, currently held together by eight medical sutures, courtesy of Dr. Gilbert Williams, MD. When I first sat down to write this article, I wondered, much as you yourself are probably wondering now, what could possibly be the connection between these two extremely disparate subject matters. The answer my mind came up with, heavily under the influence of painkillers and antibiotics, was luck.  I have decided, in a simplistic, over-stated manner befitting this blog, that luck, or good luck anyway, is the result of not doing stupid things. The converse is true as well, that if one performs many bad or idiotic things, shit’s gonna happen to that fool. Although my modest nature prevents me from self-flattery, I have always been unusually good at not doing stupid things. That’s why I have become skilled at poker. It is a game primarily of chance, but also one of not doing stupid things.  So I was pretty proud of myself for being good at not doing stupid things. Then something happened the other. I did a stupid thing. I, barefoot, tried to make a gap that the laziest part of my brain convinced me I did not need to walk around.  "Go on, Ben." It said. "You don’t need to walk ALL the way around there… just jump it. Come on….." That part of my brain sent images of me, Prince of Persia style, jumping slow motion over that gap in slow motion as "Eye Of the Tiger" played in the background, with personalized words, just like that Starbucks commercial.  (sung to the tune of "Eye of the Tiger") "BEN! BEN BEN BEN!!! BENNNNNNNN…. Ben’s the man, Jumping those gaps…  Wearing his lifejacket, And no shoes. He is a…. Sailing instructor…."  Or something like that.  Regardless of theme songs, I, in what is now in the running for dumbest move of my entire life, listened to that part of my brain.  Now, I have a six inch gash in the bottom of my foot and half to hobble around on crutches.  And my foot hurts.  A lot.  So, in conclusion, kids, listen to your elders, don’t drink, be promiscuous, or do dumb stuff.  Hey, one out of four ain’t bad.  Much love to all,  -Ben
