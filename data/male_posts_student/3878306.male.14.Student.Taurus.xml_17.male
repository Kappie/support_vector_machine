Hot Topic. I'm thinking of buying a wallet maybe the Nintendo one or the three chain one who knows.  Second we went to the Skating place YMCA. (Trust me their are a lot of those everywhere including NY) I had fun for the only hour that we (me and my cousin) we're there. And they have Dance Dance Revoultion there for two tokens. Tokens are four for a dollar so it's only 50 cents can you believe that, in NY it's 1.00 to 1.50 what a rip off in the City. I haven't skate in a while but I picked up quick and got skating away with only two falls! (This one is a record) the first fall was me trying to avoid a kid. (There was some summer camp there) and the second time I made a sharp turn. (but the fall was fun) and by the end I already mastered the skates once more and was going preety fast and as good as some of the people that worked there.  Thrid We came back ang started downloaded some music and then thought about the Freezepop Remix Contest and I started to look for the Sony Acid to download but all I got was a demo but it was fun I'll buy it later.  Lastly I played outside with some neighbors (see this is what I mean by the oldest of the youngest and the youngest of the oldest it's really an advantage) I got tired and started to play with Acid program for about two hours and that was my day.
