First, in AM Gym, we played volleyball, and the ball came to me a couple of times and I panicked and dodged it.  Sorry, Melody (who is on my team); at least we're set to earn our team name, the Losing Mongooses.  Yeah, like we would win against all the other teams anyway, even without me, who cares?  Anyway, afterward, I was explaining what happened to Alex Turner and Ian, telling them "At least when I go on the French Exchange I'll have something in common with them [the French]: cowardice."  Next, in math, I got into a couple of relatively heated arguments with Mr. Stanley.  First, we debated whether we could assume something and then arrive at something that we know to be true to prove the thing that we assumed.  Second, he was doing this problem one way, but I knew it would get complicated and confuse everyone, so I was like, "No, Mr. Stanley.  Just no."  And then a few steps later, sure enough, it had gotten complicated and confusing, so I said, "See, you've dug yourself into a hole already!" and he said "No I haven't!" in a high, squeaky voice.  Anyway, once his long-winded process was finished, he let me come up and solve the problem simply and in a single step.  He said, "Brilliant, Alex."  I can never detect sarcasm so I don't know whether or not he was sincere.  In English, I had the opportunity to sit next to her, but I decided not to because of the Principle of Adjacency, which is that if I do sit next to her, I have to be adjacent to a boy or a boy-like person (i.e., Stephanie Kaplan, because we talk to each other easily).  I may have made the wrong decision; we only have one free-seating class left before the planned date, so that may not be enough.  And there is a timescale issue, especially since I'm going to be gone for a month beginning at the end of the month.  As I talked about with Ian during lunch, and as I observed during English and French, I've definitely decided on the one being the person I'm going after, despite past leanings the other way.  I like using the Law  Order analogy: you see the defense attorney come up and make an elaborate case with clever maneuvers and brilliant strategy, and you think wow, this guy is so obviously right.  But then Executive A.D.A. Jack McCoy stands up, and brings your eyes back to the simple, inalienable truth: that the defendant committed a murder, and that the jury has a duty to find him guilty for the sake of justice and the state.  It's the same thing with my saga, the other makes a big show (at least in my mind), but then the one comes up and makes it crystal clear that she is whom I want.
