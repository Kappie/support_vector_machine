I sure as hell don't what the thing falling off and me pissing away a lot of money.    Didn't go to school, that nice run I took yesterday morning caught up with me around 6pm and I was dead ass tired.  I worked out my back in the gym for an hour yesterday also, but I really don't think that was why my legs where jello.  i think I am getting a headache.     * * *    I'm in such a bad mood today, everything seems to be pissing me off.  Some days are like this, some days are not.  I hurt all over, I musta woke up on the wrond side of the bed.  Also - I am intching to go camping soon.  Anyone down with a camping trip.  Winter is over, so we will have to battle the bugs!  I want to go to Big Bend, never been there before.  ATTENTION!  All boring, lice-infested, re-hashers of punk rock!  burn in Hell!
