It's all fine to have an opinion, but when you say AIDS is Gods punishment to gays and you've got more Ã¼ber conservatives agreeing and using the word "faggot" twice, and using their own little hateful word "homofag" at least twice with still others saying "I like the word homofag", I start to get really offended. All of you who can, go register to vote, and put Kerry in office. If you take away Bush, their so-called "Great Lord and War Hero", maybe they'll fall too.  It makes me sick. Very, very sick. Their views on the world is corrupt (homophobia, racism, religious intolerance) as well as their view on Christianity. They take it all a little to far, in my mind.
