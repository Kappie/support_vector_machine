Well, it lasted one a half hours, wasn't tt bad after all.  After tuition I was basically slacking till 4pm when my Pri Sch fren rang me up. He asked me if I wanted to go out. My answer was a definite YES as I was extremely bored. Man, there's like nothing to do at home. I've nobody to play wif except my com, which is unfortunately a non-living thing. My sister and I can't get along at all, so we are always like away frm one another. Yea, so I've basically haf no1 to talk wif and play wif at home. Yea, it's sad, I feel the same way too. L0L!  Yea, so I meet up wif my pri sch fren and went to West Mall once again. Tt's like the place I slack at, so ya, we headed there to slack. L0L! We caught this 5pm sneak preview of the Punisher, which is NC16. My veri first NC16 movie. Well, tt was realli some violent shit man. Haha, an extremely bloody show, when it's supposed to be some Marvel comic movie? Well... I dunnoe, but it was nice. I'll gif it a 8/10 at least.  When I got home, I got a hell lot of scolding frm my mum cuz of nothing. She was juz angry wif my sister and juz wanna find somebody to scold. This happens all the time. Haha, but I dun care. I continued to slack and play my Winning Eleven 7. Well, I got pretty fed up playing wif it tt's y I'm bloggin rite now. It's kindda boring to play wif the com cuz they haf limited skills and well it juz isn't real.  U noe wad, I'm realli so damn bored at home during the holidays. Tt's y I'll always find ppl to go out wif or smt. It's like *sigh* so hard to explain when u haf nobody to talk to and stuffs. It's like being all alone and tt's juz darn boring man. Sometimes, I'll juz lie on my bed and stare at the ceiling thinkin about my life in a different way. Oh yea, I can think all I bloody want, but it's never gonna change! So I juz haf to accept the damn fact tt oh well I can't be bothered to finish this, it makes me sick. Cya den! =]
