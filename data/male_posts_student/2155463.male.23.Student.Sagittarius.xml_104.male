Heck, they're even going to pay me ($10/hr.!), so that's gravy; I was thinking about going back there for free once my temp job was over, so this is awesome! :)  Ever since I got back from DC I've had the "criminal law itch" where I've wanted to get back into the "action" so much, so I'm really looking forward to this.  And it sounds like they're going to give me some real responsibilities as part of my position, so I could get some really relevant experience here.  Of course, I have to finish up my temping position first; at the end of last week Superior called and said that Davey wanted me to come back for a while, so I jumped at that (I can use the money!).  But I'm done there next Tuesday; as soon as I get the final word from CCPD I'm going to call up Superior and break the news (which hopefully is sooner rather than later - I hate inconveniencing people like this).  But it is nice to know that DRG requested me; evidently they'd tried some other people and it just didn't work out, so they asked for me :)  But the circumstances aren't what I would like - the woman I'm subbing for could be out for a really long time because they found out that she has ovarian cancer (they only found out after they operated on her for breast cancer), so if y'all think of it, offer up a prayer for her.  Aside from work I've been finding various odds and ends to keep my "busy."  Spanish is still SUCH a drag on me, and I'm starting to feel really bad about my attitude and effort towards it.  On the one hand, don't I have a right to be a little pissed off that I have to take an (expensive!) class in a subject that I'm not good at all in and which doesn't apply to my career?!  But on the other I know that I should still be able to knuckle down and do my best, but I just don't have any motivation to do anything for the class right now (I'm only handing in 50% of my homework and attending about 75% of the classes, plus I'm not doing any class prep).  Hopefully it won't come around and bite me in the butt - I've done ok on the first two exams, but my homework and participation grades could be pretty low and I have no idea how I did on the exam today (ok, actually, I think I failed, but I've been wrong about that before).  Anyway, since I'm not doing Spanish with my free time I've been finding other things to do.  It's been absolutely beautiful around here lately, so I've had an opportunity to get some work done on the lawn and all (and get a nice tan in the process :).  And Paul and Jimmy helped me wash the cars the other day (Grandma and mine).  Unfortunately I haven't had the motivation to do much exercising lately (my mom would kill me if she found out), but that could change now that I might have some motivation...  I spoke with a National Guard recruiter tonight and he's sending me some more information on signing up.  My mom and dad probably think that I'm totally crazy, but I am really serious about signing up for this; I've always had the greatest respect for military personnel, especially with the events of late, and I would really like to do my part for what I consider to be the greater good and instill some self-discipline in myself.  And equally important to me is simply the opportunity to DO something; I'm so afraid that I'm going to just get stuck behind a desk and not be able to do any "legwork" for my job (whatever it might end up being), so this would be my chance to get out and do something with my hands.  Oh, and then there's the loan repayment they're offering (up to $10,000), but I can honestly say that money isn't a motivation for me in this at all - my motives are purely DOING something that I think is right, and since I know that I can't enlist in the military and still have my career, this is the next best option.  Plus, it's the National Guard, not the "regular Army," so they do a lot of civil work, too, and that appeals to me.  I made it up to an Indians game Monday night; unfortunately, the Indians lost, but I definitely found the best way to take in a game.  One of the things that I found out last year are that there are some $5 seats at the Jake way up in the farthest reaches of the nosebleeds, so it's a relatively simply matter to get in for a very cheap price.  And then I can get some of the best "seats" in the stadium if I just go down and stand on the Home Run Porch for the whole game!  So I definitely think that I'm going to have to do this a couple more times this summer; I took Eric Robinson, Paul, and Jimmy to the game and it only cost me $5 parking and $20 for tickets, and that's definitely something I can put up with!  And they even had a really great fireworks display afterwards (in fact, we were so close that pieces of paper from the fireworks was showering down on us and I was all sooty by the end of the display), so that was a great bonus.  So anyone who wants to catch an Indians game when you're in town (or anytime), just let me know!  Speaking of Indians games, I can't believe that I actually had to turn down BOX seats to the game last night.  See, Andy got them from a friend of his and invited me to go, but I had already committed to doing video for a program at church last night (not to mention that I had to study for my Spanish exam, but that was a SMALL consideration ;).  So that was kind of a bummer, especially since the video was HECTIC (they didn't have the words for half of the songs, so I had to manually input the lyrics, and then I hadn't heard half of the songs and they didn't give me a lyrics roll, so I basically had to do the video "by ear").  OH!!!  And I actually got pulled over for the first time on my way back from the Indians game.  This being the 4th of July weekend and all the cops were out in force, and I have to admit that I tend to drive a LITTLE fast (ok, a lot fast, depending on who you ask).  But normally I'm really careful to keep an eye out for cops, but I guess that I was a little tired last night and just missed him (and I was going a little faster than I thought I was).  Regardless, I flew past him and knew I was dead, especially when he pulled out behind me; however, he didn't put on his lights right away, so I thought that maybe he would let me get away with it (since I had slowed down right away and all).  But nope, as soon as I pulled over into the right-hand land the lights came on and I was screwed.  I don't know if he was having a really good day or what, but he simply came up and asked me for my license (while Eric frantically looks through the glove box for the insurance and registration) and asked if I had any prior tickets (thankfully, NO I DON'T!).  Then he told me that I had been going 79 mph (I didn't know I'd been goin THAT fast, especially since it's a 60 mph zone), but told me not to bother with finding the insurance and whatnot and headed back to his cruiser.  And when he came back he just handed me my license and said he was going to give me a warning!  God bless Macedonia cops...I would have been SO screwed if I would have been another 1/2 mile down the road in Boston Heights.  Speaking of tickets, that seems to have been a popular topic lately; Andy got a ticket (and subsequently a radar detector), and I actually saw THREE cars pulled over by three separate cops on I-77 within a half-mile of each other the other day when I dropped EB off at the Akron airport (she was goin to NYC for the weekend).  I don't know exactly why, but the cops were all over the place this past weekend; sure, I know that 4th of July is a drinking and traveling holiday and all, but I haven't seen this many cops out on New Years Eve or Memorial Day or anything!  ANYWAY...I suppose that I should throw in some metaphysical stuff here (but isn't my life SO interesting?!), for personal catharysis if nothing else.  I don't know what it is, but it feels like my life is falling apart again; on the outside everything seems ok (good job, no physical problems, no relationship problems, etc.), but of course no one else know what's goin on in the inside (where I've got myself really worried).  For better or worse (in my opinion, worse) I've become an expert at "manipulating the system" - I am able to do the least amount of work possible and still do better than most people at whatever I'm doing.  I used to pride myself on how hard I worked at things, about how I would grit my teeth and bear my way through the toughest adversity, and anymore it just seems like I've become such a wimp - if something takes more than minimal effort, I either consider not doing it at all or try to find a way to minimize the amount of effort it's going to take. And this just isn't ME, it CAN'T be me!  Have I really become like this?  Have I become such a sluggard that I can't pull myself away from the TV to do the things that I need to do (whether it be exercise, studying, cleaning, etc.)?  Or is something wrong with me?  Am I just missing the right motivation, and once I have it things will go back to being good?  And if so, what is that motivation?  And I'm feeling really lonely again (what else is new, eh?).  I try to avoid large groups of people anymore simply because it reminds me of how I'm alone when I see people together, but there wasn't any getting around it at the Indians game - there were just so many couples standing around and enjoying the game and the night and the fireworks and each other and all, and then there was me - alone.  OK, so maybe not technically (Eric and Paul and Jimmy were there), but I have done an amazing job of making myself so anti-social that I just can't be social even when I want to be (plus, I think that y'all know what I mean by "alone" ;).  And most of the people that I hung out with last summer are out of town (we don't even play v-ball any more), so my nights pretty much solely consist of coming home and doing things by myself.  And as usual I just seem incapable of developing any other sort of social relationships, so when I want to do something there isn't anyone to turn to (especially since my idea of "socializing" usually entails playing sports  competitively , something which drastically reduces my social options).  And I don't know what it's been, but I've been really cognizant of how socially inept I am lately.  I mean, it's one thing to feel alone and hope that you can find someone, but it's entirely another to feel hopelessly alone and feel totally incapable of helping yourself.  I mean, sometimes I mentally pick people out who I think are somewhat like me socially and I've been noticing that even all of them are at least able to make friends and meet people and everything.  But I just don't know what it is...maybe it's because I'm so lazy or uncreative that I can't think up things to do (like I said, my idea of socializing is playing sports), or maybe it's becuase I just emanate an aura of anti-social feelings, or becuase I'm not engaging at all and I often feel really intimidated in social situations and shy away.  Ah well...I suppose the most plausible option is to just find some job or cause or something that I can throw myself into and just work enough that I don't notice my lacking of a social life...  I heard a song on the radio the other day and I thought that it fit my situation perfectly; it's called "I Want to Live" by Josh Gracin (country, of course), and I just don't know how I'm going to get from where I am to anywhere where I'm happy...  "Sometimes I feel like I need to shake myself, to wake myself:  I feel like I'm just sleep walkin' through out life.  It's like I'm swimmin' in an ocean of emotion,  But still, somehow, slowly goin' numb inside.  I don't like who I'm becomin', I know I've gotta do somethin',  Before my life passes right by.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,  An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.  Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',  Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.  Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,  Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.  Take everything that this world has to give:  I wanna live.   Sometimes I wonder why I work so hard to guard my heart.  Well, I hardly feel anything at all.   I've spent my whole life buildin' up this ivory tower.  Now that I'm in it, I keep wishin' it would fall.   So I can feel the ground beneath me, really taste this air I'm breathin',  And know that I'm alive.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,  An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.  Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',  Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.  Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,  Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.  Take everything that this world has to give:  I wanna live,  I wanna live.   Somethin' deep inside keeps sayin life is like a vapor:  It's gone in just the twinklin' of an eye."
