Hmmmm today I went to the movies with a few people. I didn't talk much to anyone, kind of sucked because I felt pretty left out, travis had sam, sam had his brother, and travis h was with rachel, and then there was me... so yeah. I think I made things right with Steph finally. This day has gone on the list as mediocre in general. No matter how much I did I couldn't shake the feeling that I was missing something. God I feel so depressed right now, I really want to talk to someone but no one's on... whatever goodnight.
