In this new version of Halo, the new maps people make with HEK can be easily inputted into Halo, just put the file in the "maps" folder and your done. There are already many good maps for Halo: CE made by fans. See  urlLink this site  for most of the good ones. One of the best in my mind is  urlLink Camtrack Arena . See the pic at the end of this post. Anyway, my map, which will probably be VERY bad compared to the others, will probably never get done because of lack of caring about finishing (or starting, heh heh). Anyway, heres a nice pic of the Camtrack Arena's Red Team base:
