We walked over to Arthur St. playground to play and of course it has to start pouring. So like idiots we kept playing. 2 on 2 on 1 Taps doesn't work well at all. After that crappy game we went back to Dave's to play pool and just hang out. He put in the movie Honey and the only reason I can see why anyone would want to see it is 1. You're some girl who enjoys dancing movies or 2. Because Jessica Alba is so amazingly beautiful. So yeah, I watched it and I can confirm option number 2. I also confirmed that I suck at pool. 0-2. Then one of the funniest things of the night occured. Dominic left his keys on the coffee table and Murph took them. Which leads to his car being parked in an alley. Which leads to Dominic running..no sprinting toward us screaming "I'M GONNA KILL ALL OF YOU". Which leads to everyone running in different directions. I don't know what happened next since I headed back toward the house, but I did hear his car alarm go off. Funny stuff. Take your pick: sweet, dark, or rancid chocolate. We're so retarded.    Listen to H.I.M., A7X, the Used, and Thursday :)
