To tell you the truth, my holiday homework is not in the best possible condition. I have not finished my C++(randomisation)and my geography project is also unfinished. My ACE is also woefully undone, except for one half-finished English Composition. I feel that the weightage for ACE should not be so high(same percentile as tests) Rather, a weightage of 20% would be enough, 10 for oral participation. HAe to contribute 30% to EVERY subject is no laughing matter. Not to mention that a 15 page compo only gets you about 3 ACE points. Maybe, more ACE points should be awarded.  AH well...i guess i should stop my ranting. Wei Xiang uses that word on me all the time. Instead, I will create a schedule for the days to come until school starts. I have ... got a look at my new timetable. We still have a day with 4 periods of Mr Cheng(Thursday). THere still is Chinese everyday. Basically, everything is the same except the day it is on. For example, Doble Science is still on.  Here's the schedule: 23/6-Swimming, completion of C++ 24/6-Frenz's house, finish geog 25/6-EP3 26/6-uh...ACE? 27/6 Rest, some ACE
