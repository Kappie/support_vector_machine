It wasreally fun , i mean when was the last time we actually had fun in class? But maybe it's also the fact that over here , we're not really close to our classmates yet so it feels OK if we do something stupid or make a fool of ourselves. Drama takes like 30 % of our english marks, we have to do solo and group performances. Sounds interesting , doesn't it. Getting marks for something other than writing on paper :/ . But either way , its still my favourite subject so far. One thing though , we need to take off our shoes during class. So better wash our feets every Thursday..... Anyways , for dinner , we suddenly came up with the idea to crash our friend's place Calvin ( not Yew thank god ) and order some pizzas. His apartment was opposite our college at Swanston's , and man is his house big! It's like umm how am i gonna describe this..... lets just say his living room is bigger than my whole apartment. Yeah it is. And he umm lives there ALONE. Wow! Rich kid. He's even got cable TV. I'm so darned jealous. But oh well , he was kind enough to let us hang out there for dinner. We had 4 large pizzas , and it was divided among 6 of us. Mannnn it was gooood. Better than Malaysian pizza anytime. Hehe...  Today is the shortest college day of the week , or every week. 2 classes from 11 to 3. We planned to play sports after skool but it didn't turn out so well for me. We took off to the uni sports center and when we arrived it started raining. Not onli that , the courts we're full. So we headed back. And just when we were about to arrive home , our friends called and said that they were still going to play football. So kafaii went on and play with them but i headed home. No bball kakis sniff sniff. Oh well , good time to sleep anyways. It's starting to get really really cold here , might be because of the rain , but still..... Brrrrrrr  Here's the group pic at the airport. Yeah i know , its FREAKING SMALL but i'm sure u'll find ur head there somewhere =)
