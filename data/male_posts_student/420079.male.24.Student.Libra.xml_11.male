Got to work at 9:30, where I have been zonked all day. That's what happens when I sleep in on Sunday, I suppose.  My meals have been pretty healthy today, my only indulgence being a Mountain Dew to try to combat the effects of sleep deprivation. It hasn't worked. That's what happens when I drink Mountain Dew every day, thereby developing an immunity to caffeine, I suppose...  The plan is: Go to the gym at 6, and hit it hard. I'm tired now, but I have found that during a hard workout, it doesn't matter if I've slept 3 hours or 9 hours; I become fully awake. Unfortunately, 6 p.m. on Monday is about the busiest time of the week. A 50 minute workout will probably take me 1:15 or so. Get home by 8. Have a nice dinner. Relax, make my meals for tomorrow. In bed by 10? Ideally. Then a full night of rest, and start the process again -- this time with enough sleep to exercise in the  morning .   To possibilities!   * * *  Addendum: I made it to the gym and REALLY pushed myself hard for an hour. When I hit my dumbbell presses after doing all those flyes... Wow. A perfect 10.  Now I am completely beat. Grabbin' the shake and flax oil, gulping down some water and then enjoying a night of deep sleep. I'll get my workout logs up here soon.       Today's Meals    Cup of low-fat cottage cheese, apple  Turkey sandwich on whole wheat  Tuna sandwich on whole wheat, Mountain Dew  Cup of low-fat cottage cheese  Turkey burger cut up in whole wheat pasta, with tomato sauce, carrots on the side (this meal was delicious!)  Protein shake, tablespoon of flaxseed oil
