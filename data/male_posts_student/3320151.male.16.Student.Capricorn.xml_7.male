What is true love? often asked.. and answered with, '' when u meet someone whom you know you want to spend the rest of you life with, more often than not that thought is reciprocated, knowingly, connections are just made.'' and then you realise that person has a significant other. what do you do then?  maybe we shall start from the when. when do you know that your true love is in front of you? some say the stars shine brighter, if its at night, and some say the sun is muted and the clouds cover it just nicely in the day. i say who the hell cares about the bloody scenery when the one is standing in front of you.  and theres always the what. what do you do after that? after the first glance, the second stare.. then what? again, the common answer, from my experience, is pretend nothing happened.. the reason again being that if it IS true love.. surely there will be another chance.. when you have gathered the strength and courage to do so? no. wrong. you will never get another chance. the next time it will be raining, you cant keep your eyes open.. next time there will be no stars.. you cant see nothing. lame? tell me about it.  next is the who. may you be gay, god bless you damned soul.. yes it IS a sin. anyway.. what if the person you liked never knew you existed? the chance meeting between the eyes just another glance like any other, the reflection of light from the sun playing tricks on what you see. even worse, the person does know you, does know.. what would happen then? awkward, it would be, to ever meet again? yes. and no. sometimes not everything is in black and white. this is often said.. but u will truly realise everything in life IS black and white. gray is just the transition between both, when your senses are confused about what you see. back to the point. who? what if her name began with a soft whisper as you spake it? a dead giveaway, how do you remain civil when emotions begin to grab you left right and centre?  nevermind the nonsense above, but then after that comes.. the how. how do you go about solving the fire burning in your heart that rages on and on and on? extinguish it? a dead husk would be left behind. caress it? it would just burn on. add fuel? byebye. no.. the only way is to bring the only thing that can stand the test of fire into you heart.. love. but how? i never really answered my question in essence.. are you confused? yes you should be.. because i am too.
