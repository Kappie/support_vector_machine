Today I made a group of kids do laps around the field cause one of them got out of line and I couldn't tell which of them said it so they ran until they rat each other out. It isgreat to have power. After football today, I had a student council meeting. One would think that a student council meeting would be quite and orderly and nothing too radical would be talk about. No we are talking about drag kings and queens. It not as bad as you think but it is still out there. A waring to anyone that goes to Ellender we will get you to get envoled if you like it or not. Sorry just deal with it. There some people that get way to much into it. Like they are willing to kill you if you talk while they are tring to say something. Have you ever notice that when you are alone you think of everything. Damn it sucks.
