And no, not in a sexual way. A couple of the women in the movie we very good looking though, but that's mandatory I guess, "sex" sells.  So as I sit here, listening to Crystal Method, I realize the bordum that is present in my state of mind. Nothing to think, nothing to do, and I am not even hungry so food will not cure this dormant state of mind.   That's okay though, I guess it can't be that dormant if I am sitting here typing. The mind; the most complex, part of the body. It amazes me.  And hence the boredness, here's another piece of work I just rambled off:   I feel a meaningless sense, tapping on my shoulder, A breath of success, filling my lungs, A thought of immorality, bringing sickness to my stomach, A face of happiness, as my eyes meet yours.  An impact of glorification, held high in my thoughts, The sublimity of the light, that meets between us, I feel like I love you, but my feelings are distorted,  A blurred vision leaps into action, and encompasses my true sight, Could this feeling be nothing but a mere fabrication? All I can ask is for you to hold me tight, and never let me go, For if you do, the correlation between us, can become nothing, but a mere mockery of imagination.   Â© 2004 Tyler Kuhk  Basically the whole sex talk going on with friends lately has lead up to this. Don't jump start anything, because it could end up biting you in the ass later. I've seen it happen.  Well, I guess I have said my piece for the day. Even though it's now Monday. I don't want to work today, it's so nice being off :).  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Bye everyone.
