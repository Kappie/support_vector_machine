My right leg is in a horrible cramp and I feel that if I have to live with my sister one more day...I might just do something drastic...like...never mind...I don't do drastic things...but my sister routinely fills my annoyance quotient for the day. Yet, I manage to put up with it. Why..I have no..idea.  Life...is dull...  My mom bought me a cheap skateboard today...the wheels are too tight and the trucks are a bit loose...I can barely stand on the thing. Congratulations to me.   Friends make the world go round...  I heard that somewhere. A secret...it's true.   I got these cool pens today too. They have clear ink, but when you write with them, they turn either blue, pink, purple, or black. They are nice.  For once I wish the phone would ring for me instead of my sad little sis.   The drawing on my wall that a friend did is cool. It needs color..badly...and maybe I'll take it down, with his permission, and color it. I have good coloring skills. Not to mention an extensive collection of very nice colored pencils.   I draw faeries. They're pretty. Amy Brown draws faeries, too. I wish I was as good a faerie drawer as she.   I need to find someone who gives guitar lessons. My guitar is getting dusty.   Good night, or good morning.  Let's hope this war ends soon and no one, except Sadam, loses their lives.  If you didn't know..I'm not for this war. I hate war. I don't like to talk about it.  Queen of sleepiness and dusty guitars, Manders
