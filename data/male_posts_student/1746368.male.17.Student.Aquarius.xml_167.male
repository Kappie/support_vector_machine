I usually will be talking to myself and thinking out loud and other people will here what I am saying. 2. What color pen do you prefer to write in? Uh...blue? Black...I don't have any colored pens. 3. How would you describe your voice? I know it is not what other people hear. I hear it kind of high-pitched, but other people hear it low (I have heard my voice before when I wasn't speaking just then...it was weird.)
