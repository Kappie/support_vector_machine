And may I just say, they are evenly matched at the moment =) I'm disappointed with my Weekend Challenge entry, but nonetheless, here it is     I'll post @ndy's (@ndy is a great 3D artist) entry when he finishes it, but I shall warn you now, @ndy rules =P His site is at  urlLink Artificial3D.com  if anyone wants to have a look. Purely inspirational artist, and he reminds me of LohnC (Australiain Blenderer who I know well)  I haven't been too happy with the results of that... Not sure if it's the bad post processing, or whether its just me, but yeah... This is the main reason I want to keep working on my computer graphics, my sketching, my everything. I want to be able to look at myself some day in the future, and say, "You are a good artist"... When you say something like that to yourself, you know whether or not you are bending the truth...  In other news, great thread by an artist called buzzz3d (although he's a 2D artist lol), of which he is trying to force himself to draw everyday. Good idea... Good idea...  urlLink Thread here   Also, I'm being driven around the bend... The Brady Bunch have been on TV1, mucking up all regular programming, for the last THREE DAYS! That's SEVENTY-TWO HOURS AT LEAST of Brady Bunch   Here endeth the previous babble...  Well, as the LONG weekend draws to an end, and we thank the Queen for having a birthday (whether or not we care about the Queen, go public holidays!), we must look back and reflect... Reflect upon the world, and it's being... And remember that, no matter how long a rest period we may receive, remember that, I HAVE HOMEWORK! ARRRGGGGG!  *sigh*  I really don't quite manage time the way "I should"... I use it quite well I think, but I usually leave unimportant things to the last minute (for example, _homework_) I always do it, no matter what. And if the homework is going to take time to finish (like a writing assignment), I WILL start that earlier. Assignments, I occasionally start before the night before it's due, but that's a rarity ;)  This kind of concludes my report for today. I'm not pleased with it... So, I'm going to go check what homework I have and then, either finish now or finish it midnight plus tonight, and then learn how to rig a 3D object (or, in my hope, an object that'll soon become a character)  Also, I'm running out of ways to say farewell, goodbye, or good night... So...  Out of the shadows I shall return, to reclaim my lost home... Farewell...
