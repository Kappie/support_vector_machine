How do non-local motorists react to a giant B-17 flying no more than 300 yards overhead?  Or when they see seven planes flying in formation overhead?  Or even when they see planes dropping explosives in a nearby field?  Now I'm sure your average motorists will employ deductive reasoning and come to the conclusion that there must be some sort of aviation show going on at a nearby airport.  But what about the not-so-intelligent members of a distant community who are passing through on Interstate-80?  In late September 2001, the northern lights could be seen as far south as Texas.  Some people thought it was some sort of terrorist attack.  What about those people?  What would they think if they saw a plane dropping bombs right by an airport?
