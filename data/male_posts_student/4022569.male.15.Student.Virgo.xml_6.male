Chase busting out his much over done paino songs, and me doing the same on our guitar. I thinkhe andI do that because we know we can preform those songs the best.Thenthe party moved to Craig Bailey's (a friend of Chase). Eventually that turned into a movie marathon upstairs and aDDR party downstairs.I havenever palyed DDR before so it was only a matter of time beforeI found how incredibly addicting that game is. Between games of DDRI would randomly stroll up to the kitchen only to find so suttly ass girltaking of her clothes. Unfortunately she had a crush on me which is just sad.It's kinda of funny because she told she had a crush on metwo nights before.I didnt want to hurt her feelings so i just changed the subject (Somthing about me wanting another Cherry Coke).I got away from that without hurting anyone. As far as the cast party goes it was one of the bestI have ever been to. Even though Chase andI ended up going home because we were very tired and we knew there was no way we were going to beat "Crazy Asian Kyle" at DDR      Kramer, Out!
