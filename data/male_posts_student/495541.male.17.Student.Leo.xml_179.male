Would have been 3 shots and would not have been a pair of foul shots for the Spurs.  2) Kobe should have shot the 3 at the end.  He was about to be fouled.  He's about an 80% free throw shooter.  That would have been at least 2 makes of 3.  Tie game... overtime.  Kobe was hot in the 4th... Spurs were cold.  Lakers would have won.  3) Kobe shouldn't have passed to Horry... he didn't... and still hasn't made a single 3-pointer in the whole series.  Damn!  Lakers are gonna have to win 2.  They can do it.
