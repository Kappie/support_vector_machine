Tomorrow I plan on getting the team together and show our proposal for some massive schedule changes, application forms and rules for the  urlLink Intel International Science and Engineering Fair , the  urlLink Siemens Westinghouse , and the  urlLink Toshiba NSTA ExploraVision  competitions. Hopefully we will be able to enter at least one of these competitions and use our contestant status as grounds to get our group together.
