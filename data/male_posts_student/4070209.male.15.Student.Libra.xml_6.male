There 4 of us there ot was Me Berting Migs and Jason we just fooled around the doin nothin but shouting :hoy aral na... But instead we just sat by the computer chattin with people..There was nobody home except Joelo Frits Berting and Alexys.........After we planned to play ball so we just dressed up and go to the court.....We were brought to the court by Bertings new Volvo because Alexys was goin to a seminar the she do not want to attend to???? ewan ko lng ........But anyways after we played ball i bought each of us a 1.5 L of coke just for to see who gets to finish it first........Then we just argued that we sutdy na then we were at the TV room and watched the movies we did when we were freshys.....The first one to go home was Migs then Jason and me i was the last one to go home because my brother had to go somewhere before he fetched me.........Even though it was exams week we still managed to have fun....It was a blast........That night i studied until 3 o clock just to make things right for me......
