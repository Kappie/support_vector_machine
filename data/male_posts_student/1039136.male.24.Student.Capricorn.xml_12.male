I was getting ready to write a nice long post about "Pride" but i'm not so sure now I have all my ideas on the subject totally gathered and organized but I am going to give it a shot, then go off and ramble about something else that may happen to come to mind.  Pride.. You're a football player, you're proud to have made the team. You're rich, you're proud of your nice car and your armani suits. You're a midget, you're proud that if you move to chicago, you dont have to breate in as much smog as the "taller people." You're stupid, you're proud to be polish.  Pride is something everyone.  It comes in many shapes, colors, flavors, with whip cream, underneath your clothes, inside, outside and everything in between.  If youre proud of something...great...many people work hard for many things, and when you finally reach a desired outcome.  Reaching your goals comes with bragging rights, but often times things get out of hand...pride goes overboard and morphs into the evil exessive type of pride often assoiciated with ego's and the like.  So, when then does pride blow up...NEXT ON FOX...WHEN PRIDE ATTACKS!!!!!!  Instead of coming up with a generalization to create a pride meter...i've decided to leave that work up to you and in place of those few paragraphs, I am going to write about some "Proud people" who annoy the Fuck out of me.  Headline:Suicide Rates in Schools with Evil Cheerleading Cults are likely to be 98.731% higher than in schools without them. These sort of people cheer themselves on... The warning signs of this groups are the excess of self-high fives, "Like OmIgodddddddds", and "GOOOOO US's".  These people are only cool because they think they belong to something that only special people JUST LIKE THEM can belong to.  Headline:King of the world complex drives football player George Hitler to try to take over the world, only ending in him nailing all members of the evil cheerleading cult. These people only join things  because a so called status level comes with it, and once they obtain the status level, they think that everyone else in the world owes them for just being alive.  Common phrases heard among this group are " I scored the winning touchdown last week bitch, blow me! "Of course i can cut in front of you!  Don't you know i'm the president of student council."  "I'm chadwick worthington III, my father owns the company your father works for, so wash my car you peon".  Headline:"During last weeks football game, there was major traffic jams in the bathroom line. True cause unknown, but the suspected person for the incident was known to stare at herself in the mirror for hours and having her ass kissed by her only 2 friends in the entire world."  Go to a party, and look around..you'll see this version of pride gone wild somewhere in a corner, and if you see this type at the PERFECT time...which is most likely all the time, you will notice this person and his/her 2 lackies pointing  and laughing at you or any other given person that isnt inside this twisted circle jerk.  Granted some people do suck compared to some other people as a matter of opinion, these Circle jerks refuse to be part of anything but their circle. Common Phrases : "You: Hi, how are you? "Response from circle jerkee:".....(ignores you, turns to lacky) LOOK AT THAT GIRL...CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT SHES WEARING...WHAT A COMPLETE AND TOTAL WHORE" "...." "................"  Headline: "Bruised Ego causes student to kill a girl and her 2 lackies at a party" This type is known to go off and want to start a fight on any given chance; as soon as someone says something that they feel threatens their image, this type is ready to fuck you up. This type overall takes life too seriously and their ego is the most fragile part of their body. Don't breathe on the glass ego..you do..it shatters, you die. Common Phrases: "You:My car is black. African american w/glass ego (overhearing you:OOOO YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT..I gonna fuck you up cracker..we was enslaved by your people and you aint gonna be dissin me..i'll pop a cap in yo ass"  "You(to your friend) Nice shirt fag. Dyke w/glass ego.:Ya know..FUCK ALL YOU MEN..You're all womanizing pigs, thats all you do is use girls like us for sex, (kicks you in the nuts) (dyke turns to girl next to her) come on honey..you dont need to put up with this, lets go fuck)"  Pride..have it, but don't abuse it...or you will become as beat as a read-headed step child.  And now..i'm done talking about pride.  How much pride is too much? YOU TELL ME..until then...some lyrics that apply to something...can YOU figure out what that is?  "I'm head of the class  I'm popular  I'm a quarter back  I'm popular  My mom says I'm a catch  I'm popular  I'm never last picked  I got a cheerleader chick   Being attractive is the most important thing there is  If you wanna catch the biggest fish in your pond  You have to be as attractive as possible  Make sure to keep your hair spotless and clean  Wash it at least every two weeks  Once every two weeks  And if you see Jonny football hero in the hall  Tell him he played a great game  Tell him you like his article in the newspaper   I'm the party star  I'm popular  I've got my own car  I'm popular  I'll never get caught  I'm popular  I make football bets  I'm a teachers pet.
