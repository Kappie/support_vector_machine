Compton really isn’t all that scary of a place.  At least by appearance.  I’m not saying I would want to be dropped off in this neighborhood at night, but it’s not the urban jungle I had anticipated.  Upon further viewing I see that almost all of the houses have bars over the windows…  Some guy just got on the train with his bike.  Looking at it I see that his bike does not have any working breaks on it.  This dude obviously felt it more important to purchase a matching shirt and hat ensemble than put breaks on his bike. No brakes and matching shirt and hat guy aside I have been pleasantly surprised with how normal most people are out here.  I think it’s just because I was anticipating every single person to have ridiculously odd quirks that I find this to be true.  I will say this for Californians, they really follow traffic signals as pedestrians.    The train has gotten really full.  To the point that there are quite a few people standing holding onto a rail.  Yet Mr. Matching Hat and Shirt continues to take up two seats.  Oh, there a brave soul just stood up to the forces of coordination and took the sear previously occupied by one solitary leg.    It’s hard to type on the train and make sure my bike doesn’t fall on someone, so I’m going to stop typing.  Plus I can tell my stop is coming up because of all the razor wire I can see.
