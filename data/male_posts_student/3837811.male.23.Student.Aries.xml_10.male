But b4 i can say "what a pair of ugly heels", one of her heels got stuck into the cracks of the floor and her whole foot came out. lol, at least i didnt laugh...   Oh well, go to work today and took a class that i hate most.. Very noisy, very mischevious, very disrespectful.. Two boys were 'fighting' and i told them that their group will be deducted 5 points for their presentation and everybody went quiet, lol.. but after a while, oh well.. watever.. One boy asked me whether he can go toilet, and ended up four boys ran out with him, and i whispered "what the fuck" quite loudly.. OOPS, hope nobody heard me, lol...  Best still, the freaking form teacher dont give a damn, me and robin had a hard time... haiz  On the bus journey home, this freaking guy seated in front of me dont bother to take out his bag and put on his knee (which everybody does), so he sit down with his bag sling on one side of his shoulder, and the bag kept slipping off his shoulder and hit my knee.. And being already quite pissed-off whole day, i whispered "why dont u just take out ur bag and put on ur knee, you idiot.." And he didnt hear, so, watever.. lol  Ok, fine i will stop posting about my current underwear.. LOL.. Work early tomolo, sad case...  WEEKEND, i cant wait!
