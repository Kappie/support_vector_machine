The technique they use for the cloaks they call "optic camouflage". (There's demonstration videos on the page. Check 'em out. They're pretty cool.)  Slashdot says:  The inventor's next objective is to make  urlLink walls that are invisible , using the same technology.  Shit, I thought  clean glass  was already pretty invisible. Moreover, not so long ago, glasses that have no reflections were invented. In my opinion, a mix of both would give a fairly decent transparent wall.  Also worthy of mention is  urlLink SmartGlass , which is able to go from transparent to opaque with a controlled electric current.
