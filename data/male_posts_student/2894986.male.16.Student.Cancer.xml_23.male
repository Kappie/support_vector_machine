Not to mention, double the amount of ogres. Who knew big green ogres could be so funny. Add in a obnoxious donkey, a strange Puss in Boots, along with an array of other funny characters and place them in a overhauled fairy tale setting and the result is a brilliant movie. The movie was not as unique and fresh as the first, but Shrek still has plenty left in him the second time aroud. The spoofs of classic fairy tales and movies alike were my favorite parts. When you think about it, almost everyline contained in Shrek is a joke. the movie is filled with many one liners and funny scenes that lead directly into the next funny scene. Much to my liking, the gingerbread man did return. The gumdrop button joke and the muffin man joke return, but are jsut as funny the second time around. I don't want to give to much away so just go see it for yourself. this is one movie that is worth your $8. Don't wait until it comes out on video, see it TODAY!  I also find Shrek interesting because it is one of the career fields I see myself wanting to get into. Something along the lines of animation or video game design is what I hope to get involved with. Everytime I play a videogame or watch an animated film I think about how cool it would be the one who helped design it. To create something even close to the caliber of Shrek would be amazing. People are in awe when the witness how detailed and real the the film looks. I sometimes wonder how they do it. Who knows, maybe one day you'll be sitting in the theaters watching a film i created or a video game I designed.
