I deleted what I had posted before and I'm going to try to rephrase things. I am confused emotionally as a result of many factors and more than one individual and it's hard to really say what is going on with me.   All I can say is that last few nights have been extremely weird at some points and I'm still trying to make sense of it.  ***
