And he plays guitar, big plus for him. lol. But I know I'll never have a chance. He has a girlfriend, a 2 or 3 year old daughter, and a son on the way. Doesn't that suck for me? YES, IT DOES. All of the guys I like are older than me. The youngest is Jake, who is soon to be 17. Then Matt who is 18. And then there's Curt who is 25 going to be 26 on Christmas Eve. Can you say "perfect Christmas Present"?  But I know I can count on Jake and probably Matt. Jake, you really mean alot to me and thank you for always being there for me. Matt, thanks for listening and comforting me. Both of you are amazing guys. If only all guys were like you 3. I'd be in heaven! lol. Well, just wanted to add all of this in because I just got done talkin to Curt although I really wanna talk to Jake right now. And hopefully him and Matt will be online soon. Love all 3 of you lots!  Love to those who care, Mandy
