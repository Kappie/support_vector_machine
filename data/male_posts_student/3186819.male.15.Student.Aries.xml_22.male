Whilst one of these (Joshua Hughes) was dropping a seamingly dead weight, the loss of Tanya Thomson and Michael Chanady will hurt for a while. However I like to think I learn from every path I travel. From that path it made me realize a few things. One is that true friends will stick by you through thick and thin, water and mud, etc. Those who dump you because of an imperfection aren't worth it. Another thing I learned? I learned that you cannot take friends for granted. While you may develop a rapport with friends, it is not wise to let your guard down for a long while. Thirdly, I learned that in life it is never going to help anyone to be negative, pessamistic, and downtrodden. So to Tanya and Michael, and even to Josh to some extent, Thank you. The lessons I learned from these relationships have helped me create a brand new outlook on life, and allowed me to think positively towards life.   Now I have some more good news. After many long and painful months, I have finally made up with my father. Unlike some, he didn't demand a great long journey down a road of self-discovery. All he asked is that I respect him and those important to him. And with that (or as I percieve things) things where forgiven. After months of signing From Evan, its now changed to Love Dad. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ms. Rex, my Guidance Counselor. You gave me the courage I needed to write an email to my dad. Thank you Ms. Rex. Along with an improving relationship with my father, his significant other, Sheila, is also optimistic and ready for a relationship again. She said she knows where the pain and the hurt stemmed from. She forgave me for the past and looks forward to the future.   I have created for myself a statement (quote if you will) that is now my life motto. Don't live in the past. Learn from it. Because those who can learn from their past and use it to mold their character and their future will be the truly happy.  Thats one of my new catch phrases.   Well, it is getting late, and I have to go to school in the morning. To my beloved readers, and those who may read it for a glance of information about them, I bid you goodnight *breaks out into a 6 minute So Long, Farewell, Aufweidersein adieu song like the Vontrapp Family Children*  With Love, Bobert
