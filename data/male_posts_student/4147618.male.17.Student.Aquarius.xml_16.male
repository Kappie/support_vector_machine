She should pick up definately MY SMILE :-) (no offence anyone).  The patience can go on her dad because girls should have LOTSSSSS of patience in order to deal with different types of people, especially after marriage.  Since I don't have much patience I can relate to it.  So hopefully my Ria will end up a cool, calm, and patient.  2)Physically - I don't want my baby to be very "Feminine".  I want a girl with attitude so people think twice before messing with her, but I dont want her to be a "Tom boyish" either.    Lunch time, Ria's hungry for some gulab jamun.... :-) more later !
