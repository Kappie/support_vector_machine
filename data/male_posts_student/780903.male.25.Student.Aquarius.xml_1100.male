[Fox] has given a eight-to-10-episode production commitment to the tentatively titled "The Partner," an hourlong skein in which a group of newly minted lawyers will battle each other to win a job as a partner in a major law firm...  Contestants will be divided into two teams -- one made up of Ivy League grads, the other consisting of players who attended less prestigious schools. Each week, teams will compete by serving as prosecutors or defenders in mock trials inspired by actual cases. A jury of real people -- selected by the lawyers/contestants -- will determine the winner of each trial...  Fox and Rocket Science are in talks with several well-known lawyers about coming on board to serve in the Trump-like role as judge. Talks are also under way with several law firms about serving as the sponsoring firm for the show. Lawyers from the chosen firm will act as advisers to the two teams...  "Lawyers are so verbose, so opinionated and want to be on camera," [exec producer] Darnell said.    1. Lawyers, quick!  Get your resumes into Fox before Johnnie Cochran gets there first!  2. The winner gets to become a  partner ??  Right away??  Is there any reputable law firm that would agree to that?  How much partner-level work can this recent grad do, no matter how talented he or she is?  No experience, no connections... and imagine the terrible press within the legal industry. "Yeah, they have that partner... from the reality show."  That makes you sound really classy.  3. I can tell from that last quote that this show plans to go a long way to correct stereotypes about lawyers... right....
