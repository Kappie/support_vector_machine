We, as Christians, are new creations, where the old is gone and the new has come. We have a new relationship with God, with whom we are now friends with. We are set free from our past, and we are reconciled with God, having a restoration of intimacy with God. Everything we do should be out of love-for example, Paul was under the spell of God's love, and that's why he did everything out of Christ's love for us. The question we should be asking is, how do we become a person controlled by God's love?   In our free time, we had the Lekabio(?) cup (I don't have a clue how to spell it so I dont know!!). It's a touch football competition between the various faculties of the EU. The teams this year were engineering, science, ag/vets/CaL(com/law), and ACES/ecos. Our team, ACES/ecos, won our first game ever at ANCON!! It was 1-0 vs ag/vets/CaL so yeah :) tho how we won seems more than a tad suspicious lol-we only try we scored was from a intercepted pass fromJoyce from the other team, who is incidentally an ex-ACES member =P  The night session was about salvation from God-its history, what the NT has to say about it, and understanding atonement.  1) The history of God's salvation plan-we looked through various areas related to salvation in the old testament-the passover/exodus, the day of atonement, sacrifices, and the practice of redemption. 2) The new testament as a witness to the cross as God's salvation for us 3) The various ways we can understand atonement-  a. A condemnation that brings justification-God condemned sin in the flesh, Jesus, so that we may be justified  b. A sacrifice that cleanses us before God-Christ is our high priest, who by his blood, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without blemish to God, purifying us  c. A ransom which redeems-We were redeemed from sin by the payment of Jesus' precious blood, like a lamb without defect or blemish  d. An obedience which makes us righteous-just as Adam's disobedience led to condemnation for all, Jesus' act of obedience brings justification and life to all  e. A propitiation(*properly signifies the removal of wrath by the offering of a gift)whichreconciles and brings peace-Jesus was put forward by God as a sacrifice of propitiation by his blood, effective through our faith  f. A dying under sin which makes us alive-one died for all, so that in Jesus we have died to sin, and may be set free form it  Meh-too tired >.
