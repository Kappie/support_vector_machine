I had no idea until I saw this film (by Michael Moore, same guy who made Bowling For Columbine) some of the stuff that went on in the eletion, and during 9/11 until now. It also gives the viewer a very interesting perspective of the war in Iraq. Most documentaries are boring to me, unless I really like the subject, but this film found a way around that and kept my attention for the whole ride.   Even though I'm Canadian, I still found this movie fascinating, one of my favourite documentaries to date.     Rating:  4/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M
