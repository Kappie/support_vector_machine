The incumbent premier has resigned and has asked his party chief to become the prime minister. The party chief in turn has accepted this post temporarily till the incumbent finance minister becomes a member of the national assembly and hence eligible to take the reigns in his hand.  At the end of this act the president will have his trusted finance minister Shaukat Aziz as the Prime Minister ensuring that there may be no change in faith when he doffs his uniform, an act that is presumed to considerably lessen his authority. For those naïve enough of the current political scenario I may add that retiring from the armed forces is a constitutional requirement for the president which must be fulfilled by 31st December 2004.   Let’s see how this interim political setup fares for those who call the shots and for the people at the other end of the spectrum.
