Best to do them all at once, and save time as well. But I'm digressing.  Today I went to have my hair cut. For me this is a big occasion, because since my hairline went into its major retreat mode, I have tended to avoid doing anything that might hasten the disappearance. But my hair was getting undeniably shaggy at the back, and so I decided I should have something done about it. I went to a place in the local mall, where you pay eight dollars for a cut, so I wasn't expecting miracles. When I entered the barber was being berated by an irate customer for the job he had done on her son's hair. This did not fill me with confidence, but then I thought, hey, what are you expecting for eight bucks? Joh Bailey?  So, with some trepidation, I sat in the chair. Now, my original intention was just to get it tidied up at the back, and not to touch what little remained at the front. But, sitting there, I was struck by a brilliant idea. If I got him to make it  all  short, the receding hairline won't look so bad. Okay, so I know nothing about how hair styles work. If I did, I'd be a hairdresser, not a student teacher!  When I saw the result, I was a little shocked, and a little dismayed. I was reminded again how big and shiny my forehead is. But, you can't stick the hair back, so off I trotted to class, to see what reaction I would get.  Suprisingly good. I had nothing but favourable comments, and some people who couldn't believe how short it was felt the need to rub my head, which was a little weird. But even some girls in the class who hardly ever speak to me commented on it favourably. In fact, they are now talking about my next style change, which they think should be the removal of my goatee. Its something I've thought about before, as most of the people I hang out with now have never seen me without it, but it is a big step.  Maybe the change in hair style, and the possible change in facial hair is about my change in image. I have made some significant lifestyle changes recently, some forced on me by circumstances, and others by choice. I guess that changing my appearance is part of that, part of moving on to a new stage in my life.
