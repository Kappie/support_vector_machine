So, today I bring you a recap of the last couple weeks and stuff that is still to come in the weeks ahead. So here goes it.  Here I am going to rant about things that blow my mind. Why do people complain about gas prcies so much, but not the price of clothes? Why is one pair of shorts $30? This seems outrageous to me. How much profit are companioes making of clothes. They probably make $25 on every pair of shorts sold. And did you know that in Europe they pay for gas that would be equal to us paying $5 for every gallon over here. Just think how much we are going to be paying for clothes, cars, amnd houses in 20 years. I don't even want to think about it.  Other things that blow my mind: 1. We are going to be in school til June 2. What ever happened to Labor Day to Memorial day schedules? 2. The people on Survivor are retarted. 3. Matts gtraduation is on Derby weekend. 4. Its already April 23?!!!  There is something i hve been pondering for a while that I want some answers to. Will the Hitler mustache every come back in style or has it been permenently ruined for all mankind?  You decide and tell your thoughts on when and if it will make a comeback.  Next, I will discuss soemthing that has been missing from my life until this year. A travesty of my education. Today, for the first time, I made it all the way up to the Korean War in my social studies class. You think by the time you have taken social studies for the 10th time you would have nothing new to learn. I didn't realize until today that the Korean War took place only 5 years after the end of WWII. I always have placed it in a totally different time period. I have finally made it itno the mid 1900's...yay for me!  Next, its time for a soccer update. We have improved our record to 3-0. I added an assist on Saturday to bring my total to 4 on the season along with 4 goals. Jordan leads the team with 5. And for all your doubters out there...Matt Browing ties for the 3rd most with 2!! WTF? What is this world coming to? We still have a shutout for the season. Next is a game against Sawyer on Saturday @ 3 for all those interested in attending.   Jesus said to stop clapping your hands for him so much, he is getting sick and tired of it.
