At the beginning of practice we started jogging and Ipti shot her mouth off so we had to run for for a bout 25 minutes which came out to about 2 1/2 miles. I spent most of the run trying to motivate Alex D. to keep running. I know with his size how hard it is to go through that. I kept pushing him and he kept running, I mean A'sha was a lot harder to motivate but I was very proud of him.
