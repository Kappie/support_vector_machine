Jun long came up, with full confidence both mentally and phyiscally. It was also totally unexpected yet Trully remarkable. Jun Long had just made an impact in his life, which is to make a grandslam (obviously to bring himself and 3 others home). But his running was not fast enough to outrun the ball which was brought back into field and was nearly tagged  out! If i was the umpire i would have called OUT! And all the runs brought in would have been wasted because it was already 2 OUT!! What i risk he took.he score drew level to 6-6, with 2 more innings to go. All we have to do is to score a run and control them till they are pressed. But it proved the otherwise. They made some good hits and we made some good saves. But their good hits overpowered us and we started losing confidence and hope. They were demoralised deeply and badly and hence needed to play with a lost heart. They lost and the final score at Chinese High is Chinese High 12 Maris Stella 7
