At that time, I was so un prepared to face anything going against my will and expectation. I cried loud and relied on family for support.  Now Time changes and ages, I realize one true fact with harsh reality. That time never awaits me but punishes me causing however, unbearable pain this life I've been leading.   Last night was more than a tragedy, I was so scared and angered.  I hated everything save nothing. I could not find any proper reason for this falling.   He complained a healthy problem. The doctor he consulted warned him of some worst possibility in the future. But He was helpless and me either. Money seems to revenge this life.  He cannot get any costly medical treatment ..nope.. He does not want to.. because it will, he think, only burden his family heavily. The truth is not at all for I and all of my family are so desperate in saving him... But He thinks too much. He sure thinks the way he now practices is correct for people around him..   I heard of a word of his despair. I felt totally overwhelmed with pouring tears and relentless feelings tearing me apart. I'm now devastated in mind. I'm helpless.. and discouraged ... depressed by cruelties inflicted upon my home.. just like a curse that is to take someone's life away by and by after causing him or her growing agony heartlessly. which only fate can plot...   I'm so Sad but laugh though. My tears drained. Words found no meaning. I'm so afraid ...... feared....
