Take a look  We all know about Geist, the visually amazing first-person shooter from the boys over at n-Space and today, being the #1 Nintendo fans around, we've got a run down on the top ten reasons why Geist will make Halo 2, or Gaylo as I like to call it, cry.   After reading your list I was surprised to see that you are Nintendo’s #1 fan.  You think that their biggest fan would have to be intelligent.  Oh Well.  "10. Bungie made Marathon, which is dumb "  Marathon is not dumb.  While you may claim not to like it I am sure you would if it was originally for your lover the GameCube.  It is a great game that innovated the shooter industry.  It is not Dumb.  It has a very deep story line.  But of course you like to run and shoot more than run, think, shoot.  "9. Master Chief is a boring character that never talks"  Never talks? Did you play Halo all the way through.  Sure he doesn't give lectures to a class full of pimply morons such as yourself, but he does talk. Boring!?  Did you read the books?  Of course not you were to busy having people talk to you.  After all, anything that doesn't Run shoot run shoot run shoot talk talk talk shoot.  Is boring and not fun.  "8. Halo 2 has not ghosts"   That's not even a freakin sentence.  Retard.  I think that you mean halo 2 does not have ghosts.  How do you know?  I suppose that you are making the game.  It will probably not have fake, cheesy ethereal characters.  However, does Geist have Aliens called grunts?  So I guess it is an even trade off.  Wait. Grunts are cool and funny.  How do shoot something that is already dead?  Guess Halo is cooler in that aspect to.  "6. Geist is made by the same developers that made Mary Kate  Ashlee: Magical Mystery Mall "  Which was an awesome game.  Just ask one of its literally dozens of fans.  Thanks redvsblue. Just because a company made a bad game in the past does not mean that Geist will be bad.  "5. Halo 2 is GAY"  Uhhm.  How can a game be gay?  How does it care for more games of the same gender?  And even if it did have other sexual preferences that doesn't mean that you should put it down.  Gay people have feelings too.  I know plenty of people that have other sexual preferences.  They are just the same as everybody else.  "4. Geist is a more pure first person game. Halo 2 has stupid stuff like two guns controllings and vehicles. Is it a fps or a stupid racing game? Geist is pure 100% shooter! "  If you are trying to tell us that Halo is not a shooter I will simply ask you why do they have guns?  To make the cars accelerate?  To trade cards with opponents?  It doesn't make any sense.  Also,  the best shooters are for computer.  And xBox.  I haven't played any shooters on the Cube I liked except Metroid Prime and that hardly counts.  Its more of a racing game.  Dual wielding is awesome.  The fact that Bungie took the time to write an engine that supports it is sweet.  Having vehicles elevates the discourse.  I can sort of see how having extra features that set a game apart makes it "worse".  But than you should be a Geist basher also.  Their are hardly any games that you control other people's bodies.  Therefore, to your reasoning,  Geist is a poor game.   3. Geist looks better than Halo 2   I guess that you could say that.  I personally think that games should look real.  However you are entitled to your opinion.  "2. Geist doesn't have stupid online play. Online play is just a fad, Nintendo said so themselves. I mean who wants to play online like some PC nerd? I know I don't. Plus Xbox Live has lots of lag. My friend's friend told me that his Xbox caught on fire once."  Have I said retard yet. Or that my gamecube regularly bursts into a ball of lightning that engulfs my entire apartment complex and kills everyone?  I won't stoop so low as to point out that Live has over 1.2 MILLION users.  Or that Live has virtually no lag.  (your friends using dial-up?) Or that online gaming is computer gaming's biggest market.  I won't even point out that Nintendo said that GTA "Will never catch on because of its horrible violence." Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.  Thanks Al  "1. Geist sounds cooler than Halo!"  This depends upon how one bases "cool"  If Constipated Overrated Out of style Loser is what you mean by cool than yes, geist is "Cooler" than Halo. However, If one says which is better.  Halo has giest taken.  "PonyhayStation Goo and Xbomb fans cry away, GameCube is here to stay!"  If GameCube is here to stay why did it drop down to $100 while Ps2  and the Box were still at $200?  The PS2 was out way before the GC. So it kind of looks like the Box and PS are here to stay...    Well anyway...
