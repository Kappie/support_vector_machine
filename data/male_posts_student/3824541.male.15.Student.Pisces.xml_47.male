(red dress)  -This scene is the final scene in which we see Valentina. It's Dean's wedding. Unknown to the narrator, and to Valentina for some time, Dean lived after his pier accident. Before this Valentina had planned to ruin the wedding, and now we see her plan unfold...  I sat on the brown pew wondering when the ceremony would start. The church looked happy, just as everyone in the place. The building was merry and true; it had been decorated in red and white with roses resting hap-hazardly at each table. White streamers hung from the windows. Everyone was prepared for a wonderful wedding. The doors at one end of the aisle swung open, and Dean walked down the aisle. For the first time I had ever seen, Dean's handsome face was totally emotionless. He smiled, but after a second or so his face was plain again. He wore this expression to the platform. A traditional bridal song began to sound from the organ, and the audience turned their heads toward the door. The doors remained closed; no bride appeared. The organ player looked puzzled; should he keep playing or should he stop? A few people in the audience gasped, and the others began to cry. The doors got thrown open after the long period of silence though, but something was wrong. A tall, brown-haired woman walked through the doorway. Tears streaming down her face left streaks in her corroded foundation, and her hair looked like it hadn't been brushed in months. Valentina took the the platform. The church was completely silent, and the audience was in total awe. Nobody did anything but watch the heartbroken woman climb to the altar. She walked over to the couple's table, and grabbed the single bottle of champagne. She removed the cap, and turned the bottle over, spilling it's contents all over the floor. A clear looking liquid spilled onto the carpet. Something was wrong though; the sweet smell of champagne didn't fill the air. The smell of almonds got caught in my nose. Arsenic. Valentina let go of the bottle, and it shattered. She straightened herself out, and walked down the isle peacefully.
