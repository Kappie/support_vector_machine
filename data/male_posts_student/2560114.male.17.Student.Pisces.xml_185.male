I use to think like that, i use to b like, "y am i tryin cuz nothin is workin" or like "i think this life is pointless and i dont wanna b here anymore"...yeah...i had those feelinz. But they really need to jus relax and jus think everything is all good. They need to forgot all the negetive shit thats goin on and try to focus on the positivez, eventhough it may hurt, its worth it. Not everything is ur fault and not everything can b ur way, u jus have to deal wit it and try to live wit it. THATS LIFE PPL!!!...ur never get what u want all the time, u jus have to face the factz and try to make the best of thingz. Live life as it goes,jus live life one day at a time cuz its short so live it the best u can and try not to get down on urself all the time, tiz not good, but life will b good, u jus have to try to live it the best u can...later dayz
