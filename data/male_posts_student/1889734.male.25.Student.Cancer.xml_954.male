The outing of his wife as a CIA 'operative'?  Wilson claimed that his mission to Niger uncovered proof that the yellowcake claim was a lie, and then claimed that Bush retaliated by outing his wife.  Well....   Wilson last year launched a public firestorm with his accusations that the administration had manipulated intelligence to build a case for war. He has said that his trip to Niger should have laid to rest any notion that Iraq sought uranium there and has said his findings were ignored by the White House.   Wilson's assertions -- both about what he found in Niger and what the Bush administration did with the information -- were undermined yesterday in a bipartisan Senate intelligence committee report.   The panel found that Wilson's report, rather than debunking intelligence about purported uranium sales to Iraq, as he has said, bolstered the case for most intelligence analysts. And contrary to Wilson's assertions and even the government's previous statements, the CIA did not tell the White House it had qualms about the reliability of the Africa intelligence that made its way into 16 fateful words in President Bush's January 2003 State of the Union address.      This is melting down  urlLink all  over  urlLink the place .   urlLink Here  too.    This is huge.  The major plank of the BUSH LIED platform just came crashing down, but I doubt you'll see it on CNN or the NYT.  Bias?  So, will Joe Wilson have to give back the  urlLink money ?
