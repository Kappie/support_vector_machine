I went down daves to get picked up by the limo, his Dad took lot's of photos of us all dressed up heh. The food was lush there, but you didn't get much. It was a good night, even though I didn't dance. Heh, well.. I'm not the dancing type. They wouldn't serve alco, and HALF a coke was £1.15. Toss!  Afterwards, Jamie and Dave convinced me to go to Allisters. I was nackered and I couldn't really be arsed, but I went. I got pissed, and that.., and somehow ended up getting a taxi to nowhere in particular and walking home to the village at half 4 in the morning, with Jamie, AJ and Jonny W. We all sat in Jamies kitchen, wrecked. I'm surprised I wasn't really  I'll, or barfin up like AJ, considering the amout of drink I'd had. Hmm, seems instead I've just had to be punished by feeling a bit queer all day. 7AM rolled around, and plans to go to the wind turbine and get more wasted were put to one side as AJ just wanted to go to bed. I did too, really. Everyone went home, and I woke up at 2PM today. My suit stinks of Allahs bonfire.  Jamies Mam gave us a lift to 'Holtfest', a gig down Holy Trinity church in West View- a few different bands were on, people from around and abouts. Including Michael, the hilarious sweaty 15 year old with bouncing man boobies. Heh, glad I went. £2.50, worth it, I'd have only been stuck in the house all night.  It's really fucked up. I got picked up from the PROM, in a LIMO,  TODAY! What the hell! Seems like years ago! Longest and most dodgey day of my life!
