Joy joy joy but they thankfully stopped and are getting along :) They just go on and off on with it. But they're off it now. But other than that it was a good day. I watched some television all sports. I really like watching sports today i watched EURO 2004!!! It was the first day and i've decided to get into it this year and my favourite teams are England,France,Portugal and Italy but my #1 team is england! I have alot of online friends from england so they're happy i'm in with them in euro 2004. In case you didn't know euro 2004 is a soccer event in portugal hosting the top soccer nations. I luckily get it every day but a down side to it is that I miss Wimbledon tennis coverage for it, ups and downs! Anywho my brother took the computer for the night in which i am extremely mad about so i'm on the downstairs computer where my parents are watching television and i would think they could easily see what i'm writing but thankfully they haven't. Nothing much on television tonight so i'll most likely go to bed early and wake up and watch the canadian grand prix. GOOD NIGHT EVERYONE!
