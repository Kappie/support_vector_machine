Jordan first signed on and he said stuff like "hey sexy" and "hey beautiful" and I was like: O__o" He tried to imposter Roger but that was really gay. Roger knew better than to do that when with Candace and we were on the phone so he told me it wasn't him. Hung up a little bit after that so now I'm talking on MSN. A bit hungry but mom's mopping downstairs. Can't go into the kitchen. Otherwise, I'd have ice-cream with me. Oh well. Doesn't matter. Just really hot right now... gonna change into a spaghetti strap later. Phew... Too bad we can't wear that at school. Annoyingness. I'll see if I'm gonna wear a tank top tomorrow... if it doesn't rain. Got Lisa's reply when checking my email. Yeah, she really thought I was gonna sleep with Nima and lose my virginity. NO WAY~! Silly Lisa. I love him but I'm not gonna fuck him! Right... moving right along...  I miss him. Nima, I mean. :( Even though he's on webcam I still miss him. :( *sighzZ* Oh well... Well he's on BRB, beating Jordan up or something. Whatever... just hope he won't get hurt... or get Jordan hurt. Jordan's already got his arm thingy screwed so yeah. Blah...  Nima blogged today in his agenda... haha. Longest blog in his agenda written by him. Of course, I obviously write more in my blogs than him. He writes so little and calls it a blog. Haha... such a cutie. Anyway... it's really really hot in here and I can't stand it... gonna change right now. >O  POP this Friday at Bethel. PLAN OWN PROGRAM. Angie and Brian won't tell us what they have planned. :( Blah... I hope Marcos won't be there. He hasn't called for a while so that's good. Godfrey's different. He's funny, unlike Marcos... he's freaky. So yup... *sighzZ* Whatever. I'll see what happens this Friday. It should be fun. I like hanging out with Angie and Brian. Hm, I wonder if Brian has Friendster. I have Derek's MSN but not Brian's... haha! Joanna's going back to Bethel this Friday 'cos she wants to see Derek. She thinks he's cute. LoLzZ~! Funnyness. I have to admit, he IS nice though... like in a big brother-ish way. But then again, he IS a big brother to Mich and Brian. Mich is like my sister so yeah.  Hmm, Bruce is online. Haha! Gonna talk to Brucey too... blog later.
