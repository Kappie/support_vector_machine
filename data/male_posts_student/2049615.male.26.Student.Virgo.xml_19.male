I think my lifetime average time per sitting spent behind the wheel of an automobile is at least five hours.  Therefore, as you might well imagine, I listen to quite a lot of music.  Over the years I have worn out one tape deck and two portable CD players;  currently I do not leave the driveway without a tape deck, a Discman, and an iPod.  One advantage to taking long road trips all by your lonesome is that you're in total control of the stereo.  Whatever you want to hear, you can, assuming you remembered to bring it along and it's not sitting on your kitchen counter where you will find it waiting, patiently, after your return from a trip which was plagued with the constant unfulfilled urge to listen to "Seasons in the Abyss" while you had to make do with "Raining Blood".  The disadvantage of total stereo control (TSC) is that your every musical wish can be more-or-less immediately fulfilled.  The end result of this is that one is free to become a musical Caligula in one's own car.  There is nothing stopping you, should you desire it, from putting Managra's "Tough Like Truax" on repeat all the way from Champaign to Indianapolis ( Why do we play these games? ).  Or from taking the long way around 465 so you can cycle through "My Milkshake", "Crazy In Love" and Lyn Collins' "Think (About It)" at least thrice before hitting IN-67, which trip has been reserved for Unwound's  New Plastic Ideas .
