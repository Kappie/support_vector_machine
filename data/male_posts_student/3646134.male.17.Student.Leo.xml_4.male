I had physics yesterday which was impossible.  Anti-up quarks?  Measons?  Yes... so I sat in the exam falling asleep and failing quietly in the corner.  Not really caring though, all my exams are finiiiiiished :D mwahaha!  So drove home with Jonny B, he failed as badly as me so I don't feel so bad :p, got home, went on the computer... played counterstrike for a bit, came online... Ian's username: I@n ----{Shit stirring]---- so I was a bit intreagued... as soon as I sign in, I get "omfg!!  You'll never guess what Fran's done!!".  Me + Ian have a long running joke about Ruth being quite childish (which she is) and we were talking about it on Saturday before Ruth's birthday when Fran was in the car.  The party was crap (me, Ian + Kristian just spent it playin rugby and watch people spread Jam over Minty's crotch) and we soon left for the pub!  Nothing more was thought of it... however, then it turns out that Fran had told Ruth that Ian had been saying shit about her!  And on Ruth + Ian's shakey (nasty breakup, lots of arguing) friendship, she went mental!  Told Ian to fuck off etc etc.  I couldn't believe Fran told her to be honest!  It was so nasty, she knew what it'd do!  So I had a go at her when she signed in and she apoligised... but Ruth's still fumming.  Almost as angry as she was when Fran did the same thing when her + Ian split up.  Arg.  Soo, im really rather pissed off with Fran, and Ruth for some of the things she said to Ian!  Raar.
