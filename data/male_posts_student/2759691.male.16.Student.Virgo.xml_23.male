The current owner of the napkin, who claims to be a supporter, says he will donate the proceeds from the sale to the Keyes for Senate campaign. As of 5:45 PM (EST), bidding was already up to $520. The seller has said that he may choose to stop bidding at $999.99 to bypass some Federal Election Campaign laws that call for the creating of a political fundraising committee. Although some may consider the seller a little weird to be offer such a product, I want to know who would want to pay any amount of money, set aside the $520, to buy some politician's sweat-soaked napkin! Maybe it's because of the free shipping the seller's offering, or maybe its just proof that some people have more money they know what to do with. The proceeds of the sale would be better spent if they were donated to a charity or other such organization, not a politician.
