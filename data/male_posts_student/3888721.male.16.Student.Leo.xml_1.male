Actually not alot questions la, but these questions require you to think, therefore, waste alot of my time. Today founder's day, shiok, 2 periods of lesson, then went hall attend mass. It's quite lame la, ask non catholic go attend, of course is sleep rite, and thus i sleep while they sang. Yup...after that went to justin house...OLE! The atmosphere quite relac today la, everybody play play, slack slack. Then Ivan the monkey climb up a 20m tall tree to get the ball down, Ball Pick Of The Day. After that go justin house bathe, then going tuition that time saw trevin, thia they all, so me and junlong also sat down and eat. Then after finished eating about 525, then my tuition at 530, haha.
