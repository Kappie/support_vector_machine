It's another day of orientation, and while that usually means we are busy; it hasn't been very busy today.  I am doing nothing (well nothing but blogging [as should be rather obvious seeing as this post is being created]).  I am tired .. wasn't sleepy enough last night and didn't get a whole lot of sleep.  I am off Sat and Sun (the help desk is closed then).  Jamie was talking about going to Atlanta for pride.  I was interested in going(and told him I would go with him).  I know i will probably enjoy it but it's an rather long drive (especially going down and coming back in the same day).  So it wouldn't bother me if we decided not to go -- he said that he may not want to if it's going to be rainy and messy like today.  UGH ... well this will end the boredom ... just had two laptops dropped on me to fix ... better get to it
