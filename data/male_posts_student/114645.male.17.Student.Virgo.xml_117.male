Sorry for not posting any lately, I have been hella busy with school. I moved into Physics Honors, so now I have Physics, US History, Alg II, and French Honors. What a load. Plus add Ground School and American Lit. Anywayz. Well, lets see. The US passes a Homeland Security bill worth $30 billion. What the hell? Why not pass $30 billion towards education. Oh yea, thats right, we don't care about the future of American schools. Just about the damn military and our fake war in Iraq. Well, enough political venting. I will post more later.
