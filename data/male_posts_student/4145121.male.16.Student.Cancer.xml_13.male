The whole morning was pretty good, and in the afternoon, I went to do the CCA points list update. But so unfortunately, the miserable system is down, and being the long-winded teacher that he is, the HOD of CCA took like...almost one hour to brief us while we sat there staring at his "handsome" face. Yes, in any stupid dictionary, that would be the perfect definition of wasting time. And thanks to my stupid injury, I limped my way to Junction8 and took bus home. Spent from like 430 to 730 doing A mths and a chinese compo. After my short dinner accompanied by some olympic action on the TV, I went back to A Mths. And though I'm getting faster at the sums, it is HORRENDOUSLY irritating when I have any small difficulty doing any question. 8 to nw. about 3 hrs plus, yes, the frustration and weariness is growing. But what the hell, it's MY O lvls I'm sitting for here, and if I can't do all these for myself, then no one can. Argh. Even my damn good band pieces aren't helping to relief me now. And I must say, though my mum shows concern fer me and stuff, but at a time like this, I just can't stop but to add that to the frustration I already have about A mths. ARGH...some times parents should try to understand us more and at least see we're in a pissed off and frustrated state. And yea, johan de meij is a gd composer. Pretty grand pieces...but of courz...T-bone concerto's still the best.
