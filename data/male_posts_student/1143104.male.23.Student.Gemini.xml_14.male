Hell, even if you haven't noticed a damn thing cuz you're too thick-skulled, comment on it anyway. This is actually pretty basic to understand. If they see that you are noticing their progress, they believe you're focusing attention on them and actually taking an interest in their life! You should be doing this anyway, but most of us guys don't notice things like that. Women, on the other hand, are so jealous, bitter, and backstabbing that they always notice the slightest ounce and go for the jugular with each other. I know - they're weird.
