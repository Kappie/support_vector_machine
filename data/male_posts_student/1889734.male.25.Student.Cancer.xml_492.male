After being back in the region for a year, we FINALLY got some time scheduled at Steve's to do something 'fun'.  With the goal of 'fun' in mind, we inexplicably settled on playing Magic for the evening on Saturday.  I'll try to report back on how the activity interfaces with the goal....  I haven't played in probably two years, so we'll see how the old stuff holds up against the new stuff.  There's a chance I'll end up on three roller hockey leagues starting next month.  The closest rink to my house (actually three rinks in one building) has an adult and a coed league, and I plan on doing both, mostly to get extra play time in the coed league for exercise.  I drove by a second rink yesterday, about five miles from the house.  I put a request for information in, and will know more soon.  I also started walking to work this week (1.4 miles each way).  Didn't do it today though because it was raining heavily this morning.  It feels good to get active again, after essentially eight years of sitting either at a desk or behind the wheel of my car for most of the day.  The basement is looking good.  My dad and I built what is essentially 138 feet of shelf space, and I've already filled it all with books!  Now I can work on alphabetizing the whole thing.  Maybe I should hire Steve to Dewey it for me?  I also installed high brightness flourescent lighting, so now I can see what I'm doing down there.  Now I need a reason to invite a whole bunch of people for some activity that will be 'fun' for everyone.  Poker tournament?  Advanced Squad Leader?  LAN party?  Or just club each other with sticks?
