That's a load of crap in my opinion. But it was kinda cool to have the world's richest man a block away. One of my friends worked the event, so I'll have to get all the dirt on Bill and disseminate it around the globe. Y'all can be my international lackeys in this diabolical scheme. Ahh, too early to be doing homework already....so tired...must sleep.
