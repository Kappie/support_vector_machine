We were leading by about 5 points when they started catching up. Soon it was 19-18 to our favour, and yet we still lost in the end.  The girls were buzzing around taking photos with Shu Xia's digital cam, and they kept telling me to end the game quickly, just so that they can go get their ice-cream.  Later that day, i went online and checked for 'Live' coverage of the Euro 2004 on TV3 and to my surprise, they were broadcasting it live on TV3! So for those without Cable, tune in to TV3 at 2.45am and you'll be in for a treat! With the likes of Zidane, Henry, Viera, Gerrard, Owen, Lampard and more, prepare for a match with lots of action!
