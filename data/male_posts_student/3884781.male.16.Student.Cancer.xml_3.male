Whilst this can help us to put our own troubles and worries into context, it can also make us feel useless and without purpose.   However we should all remember it is a matter of scale. The most important people in our lives, our family, friends and others, have a huge impact on our lives; sometimes we cannot imagine life without them. This is what we are like to them.   We as individuals have a lot of power to make all the people we know happy and to positively assist them in their lives. So therefore each of our groups of family, friends and peers can be heavily affected by what we do, and when in some situations we can seem to be so small and useless, in others we have the potential to do great things.   I believe that every action we take has an affect on the rest of the world, be it very small or diminished. The small things we do in our lives to benefit other people, no matter what our motives are, all contribute to making the world a better place, even when we cannot see it.
