Look what I got for 47 bucks...A serving of spicy pork something, veggie side dish, rice, gulaman (that is not so fun) plus this extremely delicious turon that I am craving for...  Now I promise to eat there at least once a week for their extremely good turon...although it is actually kinda far...it is located far beyond the Comm Building and Manang's...  Plus I have two other cravings...well, not-so crave-able food but I find them nice for their prices...Waffle Combos from Wafflers at 35 bucks per combo, good for breakfast especially before English during Wednesdays and INTACT during Fridays...  The other is Wraps by Healthy Kitchen, Chicken or Crabstick Wrap that is so good as well...with a healthy serving of nice crisp veggies, nice dressing and er...nice stuff...although its much more expensive at 45 bucks each...  There...I am now in the process of rereading and reanalyzing our stories in Lit as practice...  I find the next pair of stories for Lit nice..."Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" {yes...this is a fairy tale} and "Snow, Glass and Apples" {uh...no disclaimers just yet}...its so nice...I actually can not explain what "nice" means without saying disclaimers so I would not...ok?!   --Bye!--
