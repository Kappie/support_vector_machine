I'm sentimental. 10 years is a long time.  My O.G. group is great. We're bonded. In a superficial sort of way. There are four stages to the creation of a successful organisation. The group dynamic alters as time pogresses. I think the four stages go something like this. Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing. Now, we're at forming. everyone puts on a charade, a facade, a mask. That will change with time. I don't wish to ponder the outcome of the relationships formed with my new-found acquaintances. I choose to enjoy the now.
