I got my English test back today - got a 106%  in high school i never got above a C - maybe things are finally starting to sink in - WEll, i can wish can't i?   Didn't get any financial aid for the fall so i'm gonna have to kiss the feet of the alternative loan companies. ... I'm so glad that the government controls the monetary system of this country - NOT!!! What idiots, they tell us that we spend too much money - yet they take tax dollars and give free services to the smokers to help them quit.  Why don't they take some of that money and give it to the colleges - this whole "Leave no child behind" thing is a bunch of crap.  They lost the children, and control of the classroom when they took the Bible out of the Public Schools - it's not a well rounded education unless you get the myth of evolution and the Biblical truth of Christianity.  I think of a carman song right now- but i can't think of the title words to the first verse start out:   Ball got dropped in 62, they wouldn't let the children pray in school Grades went down the kids got high teen pregancy on the rise Free love, gay rights, no absolutes abortion on demand  Brought VD, Aids and no morality  Today no one knows right from wrong  THere's blood on people's hands  World you 've had your turn at bat Now stand back and see  Chorus:  That it's our turn now  Things are gonna change WE're gonna bind the devil at every hand by the power of Jesus name And, it's our turn now . . . .  When the gates of hell come crashing down and you begin to see the church arise  Well that's about it for now  - Peace people God loved you and died for you - die to yourself and be a servant -
