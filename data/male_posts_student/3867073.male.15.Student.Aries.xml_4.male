I shot much better on the back side than the front, which is good because it made up for the 46 with a 42 to round out to a okay 88. Saving par seven times was a definite boon, but the fact that they were my only pars was not good. five fairways and one green in reg do not a good score make. Thirty putts rocked, but four doubles and a triple don't. But hey, if this was a not so good day, I am getting better.
