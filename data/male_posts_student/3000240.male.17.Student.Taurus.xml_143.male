I had a big soup and 2 glasses of fizzy flavoured water and a chili from Mother and afterwards a yogurt and several microwaved pieced of plain brown bread (which actually tasted rather better than you might expect).  I felt rather out of energy today, and I hither to guess that it was a combination of a lack of binge eating, and work last night. Nothing else radical to report, apart from I'm trying to think of what filsm to bring to Jen and myself film whoring tomorrow evening. I fancy something epic/horror fuelled. This could involve that Sam Neill film I saw once when I was half asleep which was just AWESOME (so after this a half hours research to get the title and availability of this beauty). Wel that and fight club and american history x and HELLRAISER!!! MwAh. xBuBzx
