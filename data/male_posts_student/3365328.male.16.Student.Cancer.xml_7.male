For a start, even a chimpanzee with a pencil and a vague idea of scripture could average about 25% marks... And it was all stuff I knew already, not got taught at school.  Then I had my french speaking test. The role play was easy (You went to a football match last weekend...) and the presentation went OK, but the questions didn't go brilliantly. Either way, I averaged a B so I'm happy.  When I got home, I found nobody was in and I had no keys, so I hung around in the back garden for 2 wrist-slashingly dull hours. It was as fun as having your skin eaten off by a flock of enraged buzzards. Anyway, life goes on...
