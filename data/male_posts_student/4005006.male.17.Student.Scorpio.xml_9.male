Yes, i know that there'sa contradiction between soft sounds and epic... its what one calls a juxtaposition.  Not much to do for the rest of the day, probably get down to writing some more poetry or perhaps writing a story or three. We will have to see.        Ohh good god, its just got to the double bass-pedal beat on "Nectar" and the shredding solo... I love this song, its beautiful. Download it if you can, its 10 minutes of aural bliss. Vicious as it is beautiful, like a rose.        Ohh that I could play guitar like that, but alas I cannot.   Signing off for now, can't be bothered to write and not fully listen to Opeth at the same time. Bye!
