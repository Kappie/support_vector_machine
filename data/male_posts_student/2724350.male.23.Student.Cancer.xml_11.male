Henry David Thoreau    Interestingly, the first question I asked myself when I woke up today in my bed wasn't questions like, "What time was it?" or "Am I hungry?". I asked myself sincerely," What do I want in my LIFE? ". You must be wondering why I asked myself this question. The reason was because the previous night before I slept, I was reading the biography of Anthony Robbins, or otherwise known affectionately as Tony to many. Anthony Robbins, a high school drop-out, went through much to become what he is today, a multi-millionaire and much-celebrated individual. When I was reading his book, I was asking myself what seperates a successful person from one who wasn't until I came across a quote he wrote.   "It is in the moment of your decisions that your destiny is shaped."   After I read that quote, my heart beat faster and suddenly I saw a path of light in front of me. It seems I have found the answer I was desperately trying to seek all my life. Throughout my life, I realised I had made several bad decisions by actually NOT making any that have lead to what I am today. I knew I was in command of myself that very moment and I shifted the gear from automatic to manual. It was also at that very moment that I was able to visualize my dreams, my goals and my future. Confucius once mentioned that one can become closer to Perfection not only by learning from one's experiences but also from others' failures and successes. How true it is! Do we step into a hole if we saw the person walking infront of us falling into it?   The answer which I was trying to find was actually inside myself all along, hidden to be uncovered.
