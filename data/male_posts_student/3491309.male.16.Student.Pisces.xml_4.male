First of all, I've  been offered a weekly political column at  http://www.introsane.net , so I shall be  writing political things there. I will be devoting space in this blog to  spiritual issues, among other things.      Ashley, good luck at Nationals in Salt Lake City! Also, if you have  any chance at all, could you find out how old Harold Keller  is?
