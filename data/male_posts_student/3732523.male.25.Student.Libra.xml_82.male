Not to mention that I've actually had to work quite a bit in the last week so I've generally been busy and extremely tired.  Not really much is new in our world.  Adam is combatting the evil pollen that snows around here (STILL) and we've actually spent more time with his family this past weekend then we have in a while (including his grandmother!).  It was actually nice - and I drank lots of red wine so thats reason to be happy on its own.  We got to see Rob/Snarf on Friday which was nice - hopefully he wasn't too wired after having some  Tarte au Sucre  ;)  For a recipe see KathrynAnn's website.  Tonight we are most likely going to see Sue/Sydney  Scott/Weagle as they are also in town.  Last time they were here we played this great boardgame (Cranium) so we'll probably end up doing the same ;)  Nothing major planned for this week - maybe I'll get my butt back into gear and finish up my scrapbooks which have been sitting idling by since I lived in Toronto.  Perhaps I will also do more yardwork - I don't know.  Depends on how many shifts I get this week (so far, only one).  As for how I'm feeling myself - physically, much better.  The pills they gave me seem to have the done trick and I no longer have any sort of abdominal pain.  Hopefully it stays that way and everything returns to normal.  Emotionally, I'm a little bit up and down.  I was pretty down by the end of this weekend due to feeling exhausted from work, etc so that rather sucked.  Hopefully things will improve.  Right now I just feel like I need a vacation somehow (no dear, not an Alaskan cruise - thats next year ;)).  But then again, in the past when I have felt kind of crappy I always took some sort of vacation - whether that was to my dad's in Ottawa or somewhere in Europe or flying transcontinentally - it just sort of happened.  On the brighter side of things - I'm down 3lbs.  Yeah okay not THAT much but its a start and I'm happy with that.  I'm looking to be down 20-30 lbs by CAN3 in Oct so I'm totally getting my butt in gear.  I love having an elliptical trainer at home :)    Anyhoo, must be off...
