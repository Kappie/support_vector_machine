When we got there, we rang the doorbell over 10 times before he finally answered. Then he said he couldn't do anything because his mom wasn't home, and he walked into his neighbor's house (probably to play video games). I guess he just didn't want to play with us. Just for that, when I get back I'm gonna tell him how much fun I had at Cedar Point without him. :)
