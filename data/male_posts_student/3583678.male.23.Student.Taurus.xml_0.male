False prophets will take you in and change you from within. Unless you hold onto God's will, God's purpose for you, and the whole of your trust and love inside you, evil can creep in and make you push God aside. He never leaves his children but earthly commitments can step between you and God. You may say God has abandoned you. No. God is there in the shadows of free choice and if you choose to bring him close into the light in the name of Jesus, you are held in his peace and love and stepped away from yesterday. Choices are what comes between you and God or can bring you forth together to make a gentler earth.   Life is just a journey onto the final destination, heaven. I want to put this aside for a moment. Today you have choices to make that will be cruel or kind hurt nature or protects it, be honest or lie, swindle you neighbor or help them. So many choices, as it is said, 24-7. Just as the butterfly's wing can impact the world, what do all the choices we make impact the world, the people, nature, advancements in care of all of these and more. "His eye is on the sparrow so I know he watches me" I would venture to say a sparrow has few choices in this world. God lays down before it the things it needs, food, trees, flight, and ultimately death. There has to be fear in there but not hatred, has a parental instinct to care for the young until they too can be in the world, they have a song to sing and they use it no matter what the other birds, people, animals, think of it. They do not judge, scorn or hold grudges. They live today.     We are much more complicated than a sparrow. Our behaviors and feelings not only impact the backyard but also have a choice in every thing. Each choice has an influence on everybody in the world. Scenario: A man has a very important appointment, haven't made good choices with his time, make the choice to speed so he don't be looked upon for his poor use of time. His choice will impact on so many levels. Some of them we hear, "Why did God let this happen?” "Was it supposed to be this way?" "What happened was not deserved, was it?" And the question remains, which is at fault. Of course we would "Blame the speeding driver". But what influenced his being late? We don't know. Maybe his electricity was turned off for lack or money. Could the weather have influenced it? We do not know nor can we judge why his time was "miss-managed". Why was the appointment so important? Going to a dying friend or family, late because the appointment was so hard to face, job interview to pay for the electricity, a friend was in need before making a serious mistake, who knows? There is no beginning to a tragedy and no end on the influence it makes on the world. The only way it is made better is by trusting God, not judging others and ultimately, saying "Thy will be done" looking to our father who loves us. A father that finds us so important and so loved that he not only gave as a rainbow as his promise to not harm us but also gave his son to save us. Not just help us, not just to be an example, not to just teach us, but also to take all the sorrow and pain the choices bring to the countless men and women.  If the chain of events is stopped by one person trusting God to provide the right choice, that is, one that is not self-centered and self-serving but God centered and God serving, as small as a butterfly's wing, can change the world.
