Seriously...I give it two thumbs and four mechanical claws way WAY up. It made me sad though... His life reflects mine so well it is scary, ya know, besides the super hero part and stuff.    **SPOILER...kinda** At one point in the movie, Peter and his aunt are talking about this neighborhood kid who looked up to SpiderMan, but now that SpiderMan was gone, the kid was sad.  So his aunt says these great words, that I can't remember exactly, about how self-sacrificing people are the ones considered heros.  Heros always have to sacrifice themselves for the good of everyone else.  But, in the end, it pays off, because people would wait in line just to meet that person, would sit for hours on end just to say "Hey, I met them." **END SPOILER**  That made me feel better about myself.  Spenser, Hero for the day. XD  Then, about halfway through the movie, I lean over to Ervin and say, "Tell me this relationship between MJ and Peter isn't Tina and I." He got a realy serious look on his face and said, "I can't.  I honestly can't."  Which made me feel a little weird....but happy, but sad.  ALL MIXED UP INSIDE!!  Anyway, I'm now Peter...Peter Parker.  Hero for the day.  The self-sacrificing, everyday person. I forgot what else I was going to put on here.  Oh well. Peace Out!  Spense
