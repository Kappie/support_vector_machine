Padraig Mannion, the Taoiseach of Freedomstaki, this is new age, 21st cnetury equivlent of weekly radio address, but now it's daily or even hourly, or whenever I feel like it or remember it. Yes, I'm lazy or I'm just to busy or tired to type a blog entry for here or I don't have something to write down. Not only does this allow my citizens and people to get and touch with me and become friends in some ways, but it allows other citzens of other countries to check up on the daily of us Freedomstakians. Anyways enough with the grand-opening discussion, hoopla and hubub.  LET'S GET ON WITH THE SHOW!!!      Pat
