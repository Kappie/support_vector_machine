I agree that JRR Tolkien uses a lot of descriptive language and I can understand that you might get bogged down in detail in some sections.  Try to remember though, that using language like that is a way of establishing a realistic "other" world.  It's a way of making the whole place (Middle Earth) seem more realistic to the reader.   The descriptions that JRR Tolkien give us in his work are also the basis from which Peter Jackson created the visuals in his films - if he hadn't described the environment so carefully the films might not have been so beautiful!  What did everyone think of the characters?  Who was your favourite character in the book and why?  (remember you can choose from  all  the characters, good and bad!)
