After a week of darkness and fallen, i realised that i had always been sleeping awake for the last whole life of this year just as usual. This year, is just another year of lousiness, failure and loss - the hopes and ambitions of glory and victorious i had in the beginning of this year immediately collapsed after the losses and failings that i had been suffering till even the very present second, I screamed, moaned, cried (not that bad), bleeded, even thought of suicidal - I want to come out from this consumption of darkness, now only God above is able to heal me.  Am I losing my faith? Am I giving up? There is no faith and things to give up in the first place, life still goes on as boring as it is. I have the things I wanted-PS2, friends, internet- but don't get to use them effectively. Mental breakdown am I facing now? Can someone great enough out there just be bothered to give a pat on my shoulder telling me "dun worry, i'm with you" truly from their heart but not what they react to?  Maybe I am not making any sense here, that must be why I kept getting miserable score for my English so far. Nevertheless, this may be the very first blog that I spent some time to type, and the ever last thing that I am able to use to express my thoughts. I know that I am born to this earth with a, in fact multiple purposes. How many people out there would like to testify that I indeed have served a purpose in their lives? Maybe my absence will at least reduce the burdens and serve purposes in their lives...  Sorry for wasting your precious time sometimes to even think or care about me once.
