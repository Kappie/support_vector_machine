I just thought, hmm... a white hair, and continued with my things., haha.  Why I suddenly remembered it, I do not really know... it just popped up suddenly in my head(yeah, my head, get it? Haha.) I just love to play round with words occasionally.  Ok, that's all I've got to say for now. I'm sorry about this short post.
