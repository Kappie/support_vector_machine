What type of food is good for the baby, eating nutritional food, what will help the baby grow, blahblahblah !!!  From my personal experience during pregnancy, I dont have a choice on what types of food to eat.  Even before pregnancy I personally never liked vegetables or Indian food (because alot of veggies are involved) and now especially during this stage I dont feel like eating indian food as much.  Maybe my baby will end up eating alot of veggies or maybe she won't, who knows ! The point is, I don't like veggies, so dont make meeeeeeeeeeee eat it. ( I admit I am a little picky about food-just a tiny bit)  Since Dharmesh will eat anything, I dont mind if the baby takes after him for food preferences. (just don't go over board with food, otherwise she will regret later) :-)  Dharmesh should feel lucky because I did not get any type of cravings.  The baby should thank me later for not eating certain foods since it will be a problem later, such as WATERMELON AND BANANAS (these two are small examples).  I loooooove both of those fruits and couldn't wait till summer came so I can gulp down a whole watermelon, but me being so sweeeeeet, I gave them up for my little girl so she won't end up having a cold (old wives tale if during pregnancy eating too much watermelon or bananas or cantolope in the last 3 months, the baby comes out with a COLD) I guess my three months sacrifice will help the baby for her rest of her life.  (ain't I sweeeeeet).  Ok bahut ho gaya, ab mujhe bhook lag gayee khane ke baare mein sochteh sochteh !! :-)
