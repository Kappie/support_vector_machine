I can't stand it. I got one Grandmother talking about how she hates guys with "that messy stuff on their heads" I guess that means she hates guys have any other hair style besides short hair.  I mean she probubly couldn't even stand Afro's, but here is a woman who straightens her hair...... I mean, damn at least they aren't doing what guys used to do and straightening their hair.  That's a serious throwback attitude....  Then I got the other grandmother, who I'd assume was worldly, but is almost as bad.  She didn't think we should eat at Mazar because they were Afghani's (and to a lesser extent probubly Muslims) so they might put SARS in our food(?)! What type of BS is that?  Thats a serious problem, it pisses me off to no end.  Then you got all the "old" black people with their crazy form of Christianity, that can't except anything new.  I don't see how they got over complaining about TV's and Movies to even have time to complain about Rap music (but Rap music is what parents are meant to complain about I guess).  That's why I can at least understand Muslim guys, at least they change more with the time.  Majority of the really religious rappers are Muslims, because their down to earth on stuff.  Not up into "I'm gonna go read Sura Wahid to Ashra."  Whatever.  I'm just on a rant.  Speaking of that, I really gotta go to Howard (or GWU) or some school in DC.  I so wanna get in on that DC scene.
