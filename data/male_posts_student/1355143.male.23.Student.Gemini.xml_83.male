As for the whale hunting, I am not so knowledgeable on the subject. I live far from the ocean and any whales, and far from any fishing towns. People here don't exactly protest the killing of corn or soybeans. I suspect your problems all stem from that damn movie, Free Willy. Everybody wants to save the damn whales now, and they think the best way to save them is to not kill ANY of them. Not always the solution. It's a good thing Runa, Lars, and Vegard killed Keiko. And who said Icelanders and Norwegians don't agree? I should be reading all about auditing and the US tax system right now, but I find Ulli's recollections of his drunken gallivantings much more interesting (better look up "gallivant," Ulli). Got a mean craving for bravas right now, but none to be had here. Heading home this weekend, so there should be some good Polish food awaiting me at my girlfriend's. Watching this funny European finance masters student across from me right now, and he looks thoroughly confused by his computer. Perhaps he has the same problems you had, Ulli. Well, time to go before he decides that maybe I can help him.  Toodle pip (as Adam has been known to remark), Tim
