It's like all that high-insight crap you get from smoking too many drugs - but i don't do that. I just get the crap come to me, without the funny hallucinations. Without the fun! :) here it goes:   	I envy Smokers. 	They have it easy, I think. It’s not that I like it. I hate the smell, and the taste, and the way the toxic fumes stick to your clothes and your skin like a fly does to flypaper. Also, I don’t think it looks ‘cool’ or anything. The whole notion of something so silly being such a symbol of status in the world is not only absurd, but also frightening. Frightening because it scares me to think that people can be so stupid. 	No, I envy them for one reason. Their absence. Whenever they feel the urge they can leave the room to go outside for a quiet, solitary smoke. They don’t need a reason to leave, they just say, “hey, I’m going for a fag” and there are no questions. You try saying “hey, I fancy a small walk, a bit of fresh air maybe, to clean out the old lungs. Maybe clear my head” and you’ll be looked at strangely, maybe heads tilted at an angle, and thought of as some kind of loon. 	You’ve seen it in the Movies. A Man with a long coat on and a shaggy head of hair that has a mind of it’s own, leaning up against the stone wall, taking a drag and then blowing it out into the air, so it can dance with the snowflakes for a moment, before it passes and diffuses. He’s escaped the party, and the endless mingling, and the mindless chitter-chatter of the moronic masses who have attended some social gathering. And once again, the old cliché shines through, of the Smoker, who yet again has no reason to escape, but can. 	I wish I could say, “Hey, I’m going outside for a smoke” and be left alone for two seconds. If it’s really busy, or everyone’s chattering away, trying to be heard but never getting anywhere, finishing up so they don’t care, they just love to hear themselves speak, then I want to get out. To be able to get out, out into the cold, into the snow, into the winter that we never get here. They only have that in the Movies. The dark backdrop, with the tree’s topped in creamy white snow, and the snow on the ground, like a fallen cloud, just waiting to be stepped in, but you don’t want to because you know you’ve never seen anything so perfect in all your life as the fresh fallen snow. And the tiny speckles of white that fall from the sky, out of focus in the lens so they don’t interrupt the frame, but noticeable nonetheless. And then they dance in the sky, floating sideways, falling a little more, or maybe shooting up in a gust of wind, only to meet the smoke from the Smoker’s contraption, and to play a little more in the air. The Smoker, leaning there on the wall, knowing he has to go back inside, and continue to glad-hand the hoards of mongrel Salesmen, but he enjoys his moments alone, and treasures each and every second, as if it were his last. 	Too bad it kills you.
