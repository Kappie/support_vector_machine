Because now that Tyke is home he is missing out on all of these things he did over the trip and thus that makes him sad.  Here's how it started.  Tuesday morning Tyke got up and got ready and all of that good shit.  He tried to post a final blog on here but his computer sorta froze as he was trying to do so, thus he figured it was a sign telling him that he should just let it go.  He got to the school just as Purdy and Dotti were getting all of their stuff onto the bus so he put his on the bus and then went to Physics to turn in his homework.  Senor 1/2 seemed a little bit mad yet again and most likely he was like that this week but Tyke really doesn't know.  Anyway, the gang all got on the bus and Tyke and Amed sat next to each other in front of Karla and Bean who were in front of Purdy and Dotti.  The seating on the way there wasn't perfect but it was fun.  Tyke and Amed had many many good jokes and conversations.  At times some of the bus folk got a little rowdy and pretty annoying to Tyke but he trudged through it by staring out the window sometimes and just having some fun with Amed, Shirley Temple (new name for person who might have a name but this one just came to Tyke cuz it's funny), and Macaroon.  Tyke and Macaroon really didn't hang out much over the trip but they did talk sometimes.  The bus ride to Ashland, Oregon is a long one.  9 hours people.  9 hours.  But it was a bus that had reclining seats and a bathroom so this was definitely a luxury.  Tyke was never really uncomfortable or sore like he sometimes is on car rides.  He felt pretty eased and relaxed for almost the entire time.  They stopped off at Woodburn, Oregon (about 45 minutes from Portland??) for lunch.  Tyke, Amed, Shirley, and Macaroon went to KFC/Wendy's for lunch and since it was Oregon this was the first time in a while that Tyke had been affected by the lack of sales tax.  And when there is no sales tax, it makes purchases a lot easier.  It was splendid knowing how much everything would cost and thus there were fewer pennies used in many places.  Tyke loved it.  After eating the gang walked around the city a little before Tyke decided he really wanted to go to Wal-Mart.  This was both Tyke's and Amed's first trip into a Wal-Mart and boy was it an eye-opener.  Blue America met Red America here.  The Blue Americans from Issaquah entered Anytown, USA with flags waving and patriotism abound.  Wal-Mart is huge!  It is bigger than Farget even and Farget is pretty large.  They walked around and listened to some music, looked at Mary-Kate and Ashley and bought some food before heading off to the bus again.  The next stop was a rest area farther south in Oregon where some of the guys got off and played frisbee.  At this point Tyke had been getting annoyed by some of the bus riders and he really needed to get off and just cool off some.  Once they got back on the bus everything calmed down and Tyke had a much more enjoyable ride.  Final destination was reached at about 5 something in Tyke's recollection.  They saw much of the city and finally got to their hotel where Tyke met a mini-roadblock.  Tyke had planned to be sleeping in Purdy, Dotti, Karla, and Bean's room so they wanted to get adjacent rooms so as to make everything easier.  Well, this wasn't easy to do because they got their room keys at different times.  So Tyke had to find the group next to the ladies and convinced them to trade keys with Tyke's group.  And they luckily did.  So everyone got in there and that was fun.  That night Tyke and MormoMan got together with Purdy, Karla, Dotti, and Bean and they went out on the town.  It was about a 20-25 minute walk to the town/play theater so they got some exercise in.  They ate dinner at Pasta Piatti the first night and they were charged 4 extra sodas by the fucking waitress!  She was a bit of a ho-bag.  Oh, but that reminds Tyke.  Right before the crowd left the hotel the ladies decided to play a game where you get a point if a member of the opposite sex (member haha...makes it sound like a club or something) shows interest in you basically.  Well Tyke said that he wanted to play and at first the girls decided they would give Tyke some advantages cuz it is way harder to win as a guy than a girl usually.  Whoops, Tyke just left the computer for a while to talk with his mom and dad about their trip to Europe and now Tyke found out that they are going to take the Chunnel from France to London which means Tyke gets to be underwater going 180 mph in a train.  That's just cool.  Tight really.  Back to the game though.  At the restaurant that first night Tyke wasn't even trying hard to get a point in the game but the waitress came up behind Tyke and as she slowly walked by Tyke she caressed his back and kind of trailed off with her fingers.  Tyke wasn't even paying attention.  And she wasn't just trying to get around him either.  But Tyke did get a point for that and he ended up winning the game as he also got checked out by 2 girls, says Purdy, when he was walking in town.  He didn't get any points for that but he still one with the 1 point.  After dinner they went to bookstores and other stores before finally heading back to Safeway and then the hotel.  Tyke and Mormo Man spent the night in the ladies' room.  Tyke slept in between the two beds on the floor and it wasn't too bad.  Being able to spend the night in their room made the nights really fun.  Amed and Shirley got to spend the nights in their own beds because they didn't have to share them with Tyke and MM.  Mr. Merrit and Senyohl both did "room checks" at night but they didn't actually go into the rooms or ask if there were people in the room that didn't belong there.  So it was just so easy to sleep there.  And they had some very interesting conversations.  Conversations that most Mormons probably don't have, if that gives you any clue.  That was a blast.  In the morning they got up and did a bunch of shopping before the first play.  The play was Comedy of Errors.  It was ok but Tyke didn't like it.  Tyke sat next to Purdy for this play, and everyone hereafter though so it wasn't like the experience wasn't enjoyable.  The play just wasn't.  After the play came more shopping (man, there sure was a lot of shopping but Tyke didn't really complain cuz it wasn't that bad).  Tyke bought only one non-food item the whole trip.  A $5 necklace that he liked and felt it made him even more "pretty boy."  Cuz that is what Tyke is...a pretty pretty boy.  The second play was Henry VI.  It wasn't much fun but once again Tyke and Purdy made it fun.  The actors would spit a lot.  *Tyke puts Bee Gees CD in the CD player.  Here's some stuff that sorta got Tyke's group-the rebels of the entire group-bootlegging (albeit somewhat minimal), whispering, laughing, mocking, pussy signs, etc.  It was fun to do, well all but the bootlegging that is, but it still sorta got them in trouble the next day.  That and some of their morning escapades.  The night was pretty much over after the play.  Not all that much went down that night.  Talking of course but some of the roommates, *ahem*Satan*ahem*.  There was a lot of hair petting and massages through this trip.  Like sitting out in the park in a hair petting circle.  Total hippie.  Totally cool.  But during the night the room, which now added Tyronious and Trewfanator to it, decided to not go to the Q with some actors so they just slept in late.  They watched TV and stayed in the hotel room til about noon.  Then they got a little snack and went to the theater where Gretch (what they called Senyohl the entire trip) decided to talk to them.  She basically said 2 sentences to them, she was mad though, and then just stood there.  Nobody said anything until Tyke thinks Karla said, "sorry."  And that was really funny but Tyke decided not to laugh.  Really though she didn't say anything bad to them or punish them or anything.  Some of the gang talked to Al (Merritt) but he was just saying how they had nothing to worry about or anything like that and Tyke made sure to finish the conversation with "Thanks Al, we like you!"  Oh man, Al is fun.  Too bad he is still sorta a teacher so they couldn't just talk to him about everything.  But the first play of Thursday was really really good.  It was very controversial and Gretch didn't prepare any of the students for it but it ruled still.  It was a two-man play with two black guys.  There was tons of cursing, masturbation, porn, gambling, shooting, death, crying, it was phenomenal.  Best play Tyke has seen in a while.  Even if it wasn't a great message, so say some people, the play was just so marvelously acted that Tyke really felt like you had to respect it nonetheless.  But that play definitely sparked debate.  Among the IHS students too.  That got a little dicey at times but it was fine.  Tyke spent most of his time with MormoMan (for guys) and Purdy (for girls) but really it was just a big group hang out of Tyke, MormoMan, Purdy, Dotti, Karla, and Bean.  After the play they walked around town and they sat on a grassy knoll eating really good chocolate and watching hippies freak Tyke out.  One hairy-armpitted chick went up to this guy who was walking his toddler around and asked if he could hug the boy.  She did and just picked him up and went all hippie-crazy on him.  It was just awkward.  Then later on Tyke noticed that the father had decided to take off his shirt and tie and was walking around shirtless with the baby.  Just picture the 60s.  Thats what it seemed like.  And then finally came the last play at 8.  That was A Raisin in the Sun.  It was fine.  Tyke wasn't exactly in the mood for yet another play.  But Purdy made it more enjoyable and Dotti gave Tyke a few pets to keep him awake so he still enjoyed the experience.  After the final play they boarded the bus to go back to the hotel.  Tyke got a little bit of his all of the massages he had been giving out returned but he still provided more anyway.  He likes giving massages and even more petting hair and rubbing heads and forearms.  It is double-pleasurable usually.  For Tyke and the recipient.  Even if Tyke doesn't particularly think he is that great at giving massages that's ok.  Better than nothing, right?  Well that night Tyke and MormoMan thought that they would be sleeping in their own room but they ended up just going and staying in the ladies room again.  So every night they slept there.  This time though Tyke and MM slept in one of the beds.  They just fit 4 people in it.  That way the petting could continue and then just everyone would drift off to sleep.  Hopefully all of the "petting" doesn't make it sound like a huge orgy or anything or that there was anything going down over there...it was just friends helping friends.  But at one point Tyke woke up Friday morning to find that to his right was Purdy and to his left was MormoMan whom Tyke had his hand on for some reason.  And Dotti was on the ground.  Tyke was like...ummmm...what did I do last night?  Then he remembered pretty quickly what happened but it was still weird that he was touching MM cuz he wasn't at any other point.  Whatever, it's just another hot blonde guy.  Nothing wrong with that.  Friday morning was the last time in Ashland.  They all got packed up and got back on the bus.  This time Tyke and Amed sat closer to the party in Dotti, Purdy, Karla, Bean, and MormoMan.  The ride was fun. Tyke had a lot of energy and was making himself laugh a lot cuz he thought he was funny.  Hopefully others did too.  He sang a lot of songs and Tank sang some great renditions of "I Believe in a Thing Called Love."  He really rocks at that.  It's a pleasure to hear.  They went to a rest area again and played some frisbee before finally getting to Woodburn for lunch again.  Tyke and the gang ate at BK before heading to Wal-Mart for Tyke's second trip in his life and second in 4 days as well.  It was great.  They tried to figure out ways to get kicked out but they never did.  They had some mini-races on mini-girl's bikes.  And Amed and MormoMan played volleyball over one of the aisles.  But the best part about that Wal-Mart trip was the end where Amed took a picture of these two hicks wearing matching tie-dye shirts.  It was freaky.  And hella funny.  They went well with some of the people-watching pictures that Karla had been taking.  Karla's awesome.  She laughed at Tyke's stupid jokes the whole trip.  And Tyke's large tongue too.  And of course Dotti being there for Tyke and rubbing his head and keeping him happy.  She sparkled for Tyke.  And then Purdy kept Tyke smiling the whole time with her jokes and caresses and lovely aura with her.  This trip was splendid.  On the way back Tyke was pretty sleep so he just looked out the window for a while and then Purdy joined him and they both kinda drifted off but now Tyke is finally home.  He came home to find the deficiency that Little Twigg was supposed to pilfer, right on the kitchen table.  So yeah, that didn't work.  His mom had some nice comments for him and now, although he isn't in any real trouble, he will be watched with a more watchful eye.  Which could occasionally mean a day where Tyke isn't quite as free as usual.  But that could be a good thing.  Come on, Tyke is sooooo lazy a little work can't hurt all that bad?  Shiit, it has started.  Tyke is thinking he should do work.  Now Tyke gets to look forward to baseball tomorrow, doing his grad speech, and his tux shopping date with Purdy on Monday.  So things are still going to be fun but with only 15 days of high school left, Tyke's days are really winding down.  And so is this blog.  Here is the most important thing to come away with from this blog.  Tyke enjoyed Ashland, was glad he went, is content with the past, happy for the future, and longing nonetheless.  This is just going to be a blur for Tyke, these last few weeks.  Prom is coming up too and that is going to be sooooooooooooooo much fun.  Tyke is really really excited for it.  Tyke is going with who he wants to and that means it will be simply awesome.  Tyke.  Simply awesome.
