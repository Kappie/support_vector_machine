When the time is right, I'm sure that we'll have a summer residence in Portland or SW Washington.   To get you up to date on the goings-on:  : Noel and I are in the midst of purchasing 320 square foot cabin near Idyllwild.  It's rustic and small but it's at 6200 ft above sea level.  And it's just an hour away.  We take possession on August 16th.  : I start a week intensive course in Polarity Therapy.  More on this later.  : Incredibly, the tangerine/orange hybrid tree is still bearing sweet fruit.  : Joe, our gardener of 5 years, will no longer be trimming our backyard hedges.  It stands at nearly 10 feet and adds an additional 6 inches every week.  I hope that we can find someone to do this.  Otherwise, they're coming out.  : Noel and I have graciously offered to paint the large living room of our dear neighbors, Hans  Lorraine Berg.  We owe them big time for all of their assistance, especially Hans, in home repair.
