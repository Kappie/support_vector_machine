First round was relatively easy, I managed to beat Jordan Yap's dad. I played some cool move Bc7!!(divinely inspired. I must really thank gGod for the sucesses I have enjoyed so far in this tourney), capitalizing on his backrank weakness. Played too fast, though, so only won a pawn, I think. Surprisingly, weilong drew dominic's dad, but no-one really blames him lar. Such things happen to every1.(tt situation might change by the last round though :))Second round I also won, by the grace of God. Cheapoed Jordan yap a pawn, after he played tt weak opening against Caro. Just cheapoed in complications, nothing really special. Third round unfortunately only managed to dram, after acheiving a positionally superior position against a 1689 player. Now for the results of the other players: Great Upsets. Firs round Timwee won tt Iana trainer! pro rite! And its not he first time either. I'm beginning to get an iferiority complex just looking at these pple. Round 2 upset: Suzanna Sia acheived a superior position against Sean Tan, but drew. Still not bad, RI team drew 2-2 overall tt round. Every1 in both teams drew. Round 3 Gabriel beat Chan Peng Kong! At the risk of sounding oversentimental and petulant, i must honestly say i wasn't too happy abt that. I mean, its all well and fine for gabriel and the rest, but I feel very inferior to those pple, hu can draw or even beat IMs. Still, its not v nice to say: "hey how the heck u win? I was hoping u would lose!" or something like that. Besides, I also dint feel very happy for a variety of other reasons. Number 1: I'm still irritated at Gabriel. He hasn't said a single word to me other than repititively mocking me in an irritating tone. Number 2: I think I feel quite a bit more insecure?! The fact that he doesn't seem to mind even when I'm having this really big argument wif him, and even when I mind so much, says something about how he regards me. It simply doesn't seem very important to me. It might sound a little silly (or actually a lot silly) that I dun like the fact that he seems able to be so dismissive, so inconsequential to him. His life just keeps going on, but I am like, fixated?, on this crazy argument. Anyway, I haven't spoken a word to gabriel today either. i have just asked wee to help me in a plan: Tok to gabriel over msn and find out wad he really thinks. Of course, I have my strong suspicions tt he doesn't care either way, but it is worthwhile to find out either way. I can at least find out if it is worth my time and trouble trying to salvage my friendship with gabriel, or is it simply wrecked beyong repair. I wan to go somewhere else other than a hawker center tml for lunch la, I dun care...I actually asked bryan wad he thought: Is pride more important than friendship? If it was simply a matter of tt alone though, I think my frenship would be more important to me. However, I also dun really noe if there is a frenship in the first place, or even if its wrecked beyond repair. But as bryan put it, Pride doesn't really have a value anyway, whereas Friendship is worth more than gold... Still, on a different n brighter(slightly) note, i will be playing Joash Ee tml. I tink I will get screwed, but u neva noe. tyconess has its benefits... :) with God on our side, who shall we fear? No-one of course, but I dun noe if He wans me to win. He might have other plans. I will try my best to accept them though, even if they seem bad to me in the short term, such as if I lose. "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD. Plans to help you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." On this (divinely inspired?) note, I shall end this blog entry. Its really quite late already, anyway. Good nite, my alter ego!
