Didn't have a big party or anything for turning 16. Just had my grandparents over, an uncle, and Tom. Got a big ole Spongebob Square Pants cake, and that was really cool. Well, school is coming up really soon just weeks away now so our summers are about to end. I didn't get to do much at all if anything what so ever. But there is always next year. Hope you enjoyed your summer and enjoy the last bit of it. I'm out.
