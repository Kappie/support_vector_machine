Normally if I were to wake up while it was dark and gloomy outside, I would be pretty happy and snuggle back underneath my warm blanket. But for today, I stare out the window thinking. Thinking of really silly questions that have no definite answers.  Then the rain comes down hitting the ground telling its secrets, secrets that once I could hear. But now it’s covered with deep thoughts and emotion. Why is it always so easy to complicate stuff and so difficult to see the simplest of things? Crap, I’m just typing crap. I drew this sunflower you below to distract myself hallucinating (errmmm.. too strong a word to use, but I think you get the idea.).    For the rest of the afternoon, I did a sketch of a full detailed character. No name for her yet, any suggestions? Maybe one day with a nice story line, I might use her to produce my very own series of Manga. But until that day comes, I shall remain as an architect in training. Packed the room a little, what difference can I make when it’s my sisters’ stuff all over the place? ARRGGHHhh!   Towards the end of the day, I was feeling a little bit better. Tara gave me a song to search, but she can’t remember the singer. So I had to gather some clues from her, lucky for me she remembers the lyrics. Having an idea of who the singer was, I searched the net and at the same time, asked around. Thanks to Kenneth, I got to know that there still this server on mirc with that song. I can’t remember the last time I actually chatted on mirc, but it felt weird using it again after such a long pause. Yupz, I’ve got the song downloaded and sent over to Tara. Got myself a nice long shower, and hopped onto my sister’s bed. Since I can’t use the computer because my Lao Er was watching animes, I tuned into Perfect 10 on the radio, or rather Baby T’s radio. I got bored and so I started forwarding nice sms(s), can’t let my free sms go to waste now, can I? Cleared Baby T’s inbox as I replied new messages, can’t believe I pressing the wrong button sending my unfinished reply into draft. Before long, there was no one to bug on the phone, partly due to my slow replies I guess. Off I went to bed…zzZZ
