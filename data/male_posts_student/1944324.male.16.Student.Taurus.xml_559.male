Fanfiction Recommendation of the Week ("You might not care, but I do"): "Eye of the Storm" on fanfiction.net. It's about several OT Star Wars characters getting stuck on Earth. In the Star Wars universe it was in between ESB and ROTJ. On Earth it's the middle of convention season. Not as bad as most with that general setup as there are no fangirls. Quote: "I think I need my dosage checked. At the moment I'm in Colorado with my ex-husband and Luke Skywalker while Artoo Detoo serves iced tea and my son plays with a Princess of Alderaan in the kitchen." She gave a high-pitched, hysterical laugh. "So are really, really realistic hallucinations a common side effect of that new stress medication you put me on?"   It's May, it's May, the lusty month of May! :)  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.
