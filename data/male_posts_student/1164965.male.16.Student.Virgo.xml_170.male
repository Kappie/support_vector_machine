I have had some friends in the past month bring up this fact that i do resemble Alf the tv icon.  i think its great and will make sure that this never dies.  Another thing i want to add is i loved your little peace on JNCO.  i was one of the unfortunate kids and never did have a pair because my parents thought they were hideous, but i envied everyone that had a pair.  --Alf
