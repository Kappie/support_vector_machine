You see, just a second ago, I decided to go out and get the mail, because sometimes I get mail, and I can read it, and it gives me something to do.  Well, before I went outside, I had to make sure that I was fully dressed.  And I was, but I didn't have anything on my feet!    ------------------------------------ JUSTIN'S RULE OF LIFE NUMBER ONE: It's usually a pretty good idea to put shoes on if you're going outside.  Otherwise, you can hurt your foot.  You can also get tapeworm.  Or roundworm.  Or whatever worm it is that you get by not wearing shoes.  And that's not good.  Because it can eat your stomach and you can die.* ------------------------------------  Well, I didn't want to have to get socks on (because it takes quite a while), so I decided just to wear sandals.    Now, my sandals are velcro.  And the fine makers of my sandals (Faded Glory) decided to make the sandals easy to put on for people like me.  You see, on the left foot, for example, the straps point to the left.  That way you know that it goes on your left foot.  I usually have no problem with that!  It's quite easy.  So, when I went to put them on, I looked at one of the shoes.  "Which foot does this go on?" I thought to myself.  The strap was pointing to the left.  "It must go on the left!"  So, I started to put it on my left foot, when suddenly I had other thoughts.  "Maybe it's pointing to the left because it goes on the foot that has the big toe furthest to the left."  I thought for a moment.  "That would be my right foot!"  So I put it on my right foot, and put the other on my left foot.  Suddenly I realized how uncomfortable they were.    But, at that moment, I fell down.    It kind of hurt but not that much.    I went out to the mailbox only to find that there was nothing for me.  And the world was saved yet again by JUSTIN KLINE!!!     ----------------------------------  *JUSTIN'S RULE OF LIFE NUMBER TWO: Don't smoke.  It pollutes the air.
