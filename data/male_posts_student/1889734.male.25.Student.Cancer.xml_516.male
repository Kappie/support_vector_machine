We have spent a generation trying to mediate some peace in the middle east, urging restraint and struggling to keep the tensions from boiling over, resulting in nothing but continued murder.  For example - "Hamas has never accepted peace with Israel, and while Sheik Yassin was the group's spiritual leader, Israel accused him of responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks. Still, it's hard to see how his martyrdom will make Israel any safer. Hamas will now redouble its efforts to send human torpedos into Israel."  The NYT, like most, fails to recognize that this is a WAR.  It isn't a managed conflict, it isn't some 'cycle of violence', it's a war, and the sooner we treat it as a war, the sooner it will end and the sooner lives will be saved.  To fret that this killing will only increase the fighting is like being surprised that the Germans fought back in the Ardennes.  In a war, you fight harder when the other guy is making progress against you.  The misguided sense that we can negotiate an end to this is doing nothing but furthering the bloodshed.  By tying Israel's hands, we only embolden the murderous thugs to continue their operations.  It's time to allow this thing to end the only way it can.  It's time to recognize it as a war, and unleash both sides to fight it out and settle the issue.  Peace has NEVER lasted without total victory.  OUr efforts to break through this historical fact is only serving to maintain the misery.    Let Israel kill the Palestinian leadership.  Kill Arafat and his ilk.  Then establish their own governance there in Ramallah.  Colonize the Palestinians until they learn that peaceful coexistence is better than sending their children to explode in Tel Aviv.    The Wall Street Journal has a good column today www.opinionjournal.com.  They make some startling statements, such as the average Palestinian is a human being, with human desires.  It's amazing that we have reached the point where that seems radical.  The average Palestinian is so screwed up, so confused, and completely caught up in the lies of their leadership.  They are not blameless in all of this, but I believe they will respond as humans historically respond when faced with a simple choice - an improving life, or continued death.  So far, they haven't been free to confront this choice so long as thier leadership is immune from removal.  Let's get this war over with, for the sake of coming generations who have little more in their future but a bomb belt.
