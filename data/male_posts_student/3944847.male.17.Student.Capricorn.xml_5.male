Today we took Sejarah Paper 1 , Additional Maths Paper 2 , and English for Science and Technology Paper 1... The Sej paper 1 was quite hard because the optional answers are almost the same...Hopefully I can get pass for Sej...For Add Maths , it is damn difficult for me...Was kinda confuse because the paper 1 was more difficult than paper 2...30% of the question I can`t do...There is no more chance for me to get an A for Add Maths this time...For EST , I was shocked because I thought paper 1 was suppose to be objective but it turned out to be structure and essay question...('-'ll)...Luckily I was able to do the paper with crap in it...    Well , I`m here to announced that she is getting back with her ex(I think...) and there is nothing I can do... I lost in the war without a battle... She doesn`t even need to choose to make a desicion...Maybe this is because I`m not someone that is important to her...Maybe I`m just a friend to her...A normal friend... Maybe I`m just a dot in her life...A dot that will not change anything...I remembered once she told me that she doesn`t have trust in her ex and thats why they broke up... But time changes everything...Now they have become better and her ex often come in our class and visit her... I feel kinda sad now... Not too sad... I can`t really concentrate in my studies... Thinking about things...This will sure affect my results of the exam this time... I think this is the end of the story... It turned out to be a sad ending...A really sad ending... I miss her but I think I should not contact her anymore...If now I were given a wish , I wish that I could have know her earlier...Maybe it will changes everything...Or maybe it will be still the same...Same ending... But who knows ? There is nothing much I can do now...All I can do is wish her for the best...And I`ll wait for her...   Current Music : Onitsuka Chihiro - Infection  Mood : Sad  : (
