If he were going to, say, be honest, or answer questions that weren't pre-submitted by a select group of reporters then I might be interested in what he has to say.  Well, in theory.  In practice I would tune out because he makes me ill.  Although I did love the comment at his last press conference:  "The great thing about being president is that millions of people pray for me."  That's not made up, y'all.  It was a response to a hard-hitting question about Bush's religious faith and how it helps guide him (the media really should be embarrassed about that).  But, dammit, I need to know what Quentin Tarantino is going to say if the singing on AI sucks.  I need to see if that redheaded kid won't suck the energy out of the room.  I want to hear Jennifer Hudson yell at me.  In short, it's an important part of my week and for a man who has already fucked up my future to fuck this up is irritating.  (umm...to be on the safe side: I love Bush.  Bush is God.  All who oppose Bush are evil.)  Second, on the subject of the news media- if they don't stop revealing scandals now they're going to hand the election to Bush.  People will get sick of hearing the bad news and it wil make it seem like he's getting attacked.  Wait 'til August, reporters, to get over your guilt at being (mostly) ridiculously lazy for the past 3 years.  Third, if a singer is American why should her cd not be released here first?  Last night I stumbled onto a website where I watched Anastacia's new video.  You probably don't know who she is because she doesn't sell well in the States, but if you do and you enjoy her then I love you.   So the song was good.  And more importantly it's stuck in my head, which means I should listen to it to help purge it.  And that means ordering an import from some website and waiting a month, unless by chance I can find it at Tower in the village.   But it shouldn't be a question of "if";  it should just be there.    Heck, being an American in the Age of Bush should at least give me the advantage of having the damn cd I want available when I want it.  What else is the "War on Terror" if not the "War to get Americans Stuff as Cheaply as Possible by Opening Markets in and Gaining the Labor of Muslim Countries"?    Also, if you haven't heard Nellie McKay's album, "Get Away From Me" you should.  It kicks ass.    On the bright side for the first time in years I know where the Vice President is (China.  And, coincidentally, a bunch of Chinese in Iraq were kidnapped a few days ago).  Which means I have to find a new $5 question....
