You may respond by answering it yourself, or picking out something you liked/hated/thought was funny/now want to kill me for.     1: Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4  type it here:   -guage because the advent of writing has perserved Latin for our    2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?  A book:  The Creator and the Cosmos  by Hugh Ross, Ph.D   3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?  Umm... I haven't done that in about a week.   4: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is?  7:10 PM.   5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?   7:13 PM; not bad.   6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?    Yesterday  by the Beatles. (The present "Song or Tune of the Week!")   7: When did you last step outside? What were you doing?  I was walking out of Mt. Assisi after having completed work and getting ready to walk home, about a half hour ago.   8: Before you came to this website, what did you look at?   Nothing at all.   9: What are you wearing?  Clothes...   10: Did you dream last night?  If I did, I certainly don't remember.   11: When did you last laugh?  Maybe at school.    12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?   WOW, like everything. In my room I have: 4 maps, a chinese lantern, a calendar, miscellaneous pieces of paper including poems, lyrics to a Scottish song, prayer cards, birthday cards, a class picture, the pages of my Word of the Day calendar on my doors (since January 1, so exactly 146 of them), and a picture of Sister Camille's car with hot dogs, condiments, and whipped cream on it (a senior prank from last year). Also on my wall is a portrait of Christ and a tapestry from the Middle East.   13: Seen anything weird lately?  I found a ripped up note on the sidewalk entitled "Dear Nick." The rest of the pieces I found are unfortunately too random; I can't make anything out.   14: What do you think of this quiz?  I hope people don't get bored.   15: What is the last film you saw?  "In America," about an Irish family that immigrates to America and their transition here; sounds boring, but it was very good.   16: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?  I would buy either some more cool stuff for my room or a USB port for my computer. Or a country. And I'd give some to Vincentian so they could a) fix the bells and b) get air conditioning and c) enlarge art facilities.   17: Tell me something about you that I don't know:  Well, as Adrian Henry put it, you're just a quiz. But, if, as I suppose you mean, I should tell  everyone  something about me they don't know, I guess I will. Uh... I really like Scotch tape.   18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?  Wars would stop and everyone would be smarter and more open-minded, and with more common sense. People wouldn't make fun of people (earnestly) for stupid things and one wouldn't need to take classes about things they'll never need to know about, such as biology. And more people would play the bagpipes.   19: Do you like to dance?  Nope. Not even when I'm alone.   20: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?  No idea whatsoever; I'll let my wife decide.   21: Imagine your second child is a boy, what do you call him?  Theodosius and Demetrius are both famous saints, and go nicely with "Schrenk."   22: Would you ever consider living abroad?  Yeah; I'd like to live in Scotland or anywhere in Western Europe.
