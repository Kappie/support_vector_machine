It's in Barcelona, I mean, not that I don't like London, but considering I was up last night at about half twelve, and it just randomly started raining, I mean, honestly, that's not how summer should be, should it?    I'm trying to lose some weight before I go, but ..meh, you know...anybody who has tried to lose weight will know how I'm feeling.  In other news, I'm addicted to frosties.
