So if anyone has any pictures on disc, let me know or drop them off here so I can do that. I really need to do something with my time, and since I can't quite motivate myself to reread  Owen Meany , a really good book that I need to summarize chapter by chapter as well as comment, in addition to keeping a list of characters with descriptions. And do that for  Snow falling on cedars.  Both books are fantastic, but as in all scholastic pursuits, busywork depresses me. Plus I have to read three books for history. Time management is not my forte.   urlLink this land
