And as we spoke of her relationship with Noah, I wished that I could give her some sort of advice. She is such a sweet girl, and Noah just isn't really right for her. I think she sees that on some level but he doesn't. I have no idea why they're still together. Oh well. I'd write more but I must clean my room and write a biography on Ezra Pound. I do need some sleep.
