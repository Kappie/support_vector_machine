Ain't she cute? :D     That's the Visual Memory Unit (Memory Card) of the Dreamcast. You could download mini-games within the game itself.  I love Hikari. For some reason, she has some nice philosophical ideas, like which came out first, the chicken or the egg (the never-ending question that no one will possibly provide a correct answer). She said that the egg came first because without the egg, there won't be any chicken.  When I first entered the Chao Garden, the first thing I found were two Chao Eggs. So, the idea is kinda true in my opinion :P  I just came back from a family gathering dinner. It was to celebrate my uncle's company's 40th anniversary. There were two tables. The food from each table cost around RM1000. The most expensive dish was the abalone, mushrooms and sea cucumbers. It costs around RM300. It tastes like crap, anyway.  It seems to be a waste of money, eating food that costs RM2000 which will be digested sooner or later. My three female cousins seemed to be great singers, to my surprise (there's a karaoke at the restaurant). They seem to speak in drawling voices, but when they sing, they seem to be like S.H.E.  And, I seem to notice that some girls stare at me. Is it because I'm cool, or because I'm a nerdy geek (this applies to one of my cousins)? Sometimes I think I look cool, but then I stare at my tiny arms and feel like a dork. Anyone care to answer this question (to those who have seen my picture before)?  About my RO life, I managed to get my Huntress at last. But then, Iona seemed pretty angry at me for using her name (said something about "you guys degrading me", which is referring to Dinghy, Clem and me). Iona, if you are reading this, I want you to know something. I LOVED your name. It's probably the most beautiful real-life name (not something like Aeris, Rinoa, Yuna, Tifa, etc.) which is why I named my Huntress after you. If you are still pissed off, I apologize and will ask Syn to change her name (Sora said it's possible, so I gotta contact Syn when he's online).  Till then, ja ne~
