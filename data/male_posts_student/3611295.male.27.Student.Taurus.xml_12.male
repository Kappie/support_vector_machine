I wonder whose turn it is to buy Rubio's?  Maybe I'll shine up my wooden nickle and splurge this time.  Luke's class also is coming up tomorrow morning.  We'll see if Joe comes back with a vengeance or sits on the DL again with Montezuma's Revenge.  I know I'm waiting at the edge of my seat.  Ok guys, that's all for now.  And by the way, and rebel factions within the Guppies WILL be dealt with accordingly.  Certain Guppy members need to realize that they're not Che Guevara or Pancho Villa or any other radical leader.  Some people need to just shut up and trim the edges and pluck the fruit, metaphorically speaking.  So, quash those feelings gentlemen and deal with it.  I believe "Flaking" is stated on you contracts on page one along with getting drunk and inappropriately touching one's sister.  Read your contracts!  Later!
