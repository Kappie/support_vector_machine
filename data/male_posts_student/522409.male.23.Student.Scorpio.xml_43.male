Like sheer will can create situations that are agreeable to you?  It's time I get over that childish notion and accept reality.  There are no sure things.  Only luck, and hard work.  And even then, some things are left up to intangibles.  Call it the affirmative action maxim or whatever else you feel like calling it.  Sometimes, regardless of how many ducks you have in your proverbial row, you get it stuck to you.  And that's where I am right now.  Me, the optimism poster child... the "take 'em as they come" guy (at least in talking with my friends... never so much in my own dealings)... And this really sucks more than I can say.  Anyway, um... on the same day that this swift punch in the gut came, I got a really incredible email from someone I don't even know.  She reads this blog, and enjoys it... and took the time to say so.  And so V, thank you for making this day sting much less for a while.  I've spent the last 24 hours doing almost nothing but reading up on grad schools.  It's torture, because I have to wait to go... but it's great to know there are all these great programs out there when the time comes.  And come it will.  And I don't really hate snow.  I've been lying.  I want to go skiing.  heh.  But I need to go away for a while.  Away away, not ICCA road-trip away, because those aren't relaxing.  Cape Breton away.  Jesse, you with me?

Blogger is only letting me post selected archives or something?  Weird.
