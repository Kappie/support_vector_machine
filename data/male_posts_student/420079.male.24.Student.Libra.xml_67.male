This sucks for two reasons:  1) I don't like waiting, and 2) this means I have to research and write the law review write-on entry this weekend, on the (quite large) chance that I didn't grade onto law review.  Dammit!  Points of note: Because of regulations at the court, I have started to put two spaces in between sentences.  Despite the fact that this goes against everything I have ever been taught, and everything I have ever done, it is strangely satisfying.  At the same time, I am concerned, because I have railed against the practice in the past.  Should be interesting to see what happens.  Second: Frith and I are cooking dinner tonight. She wanted to get me scallops but, upon doing a Google image search and realizing they look like little sea dumplings, I would have none of it. Disgusting! I told her. She asked if mangoes were okay. I asked her if she was referring to the fruit or to another kind of dumpling fish. It was the fruit, so I gave her the green light.  Third: My new favorite drink is a Crown  Coke -- i.e. 1 part Canadian whiskey, 2 parts Coke, all over ice. It is absolutely delicious, and I am shelling out the big bucks for the first full-priced fifth I have purchased in a long time!  (The last fifth I bought was in the Virgin Islands, but the liquor there is as cheap as the girls on the corner of Cedar and Lee, so that probably doesn't count.)  Fourth: I want to be a writer again. Ideas are slowly accumulating. Latest musing: What would happen if someone decided to hunt down all the federal judges they disagreed with, in an attempt to get more likeminded judges nominated? This idea popped up when I was told that the judge shouldn't be answering the locked office door, for security reasons. Hmmmm.....  Fifth: Now that I think about it, I should have talked about buying a fifth in this sentence. It would have been very poetic. I guess I can talk about how my girlfriend's name is Frith? That works.  That is all -- M@
