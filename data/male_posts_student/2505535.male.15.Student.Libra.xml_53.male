French oral - went very well, I was 2 marks off an A* and it was the exact same exam I'm gunna get next year for GCSE. A whole year to try and up myself 2 marks.  English media - very hard, and there was almost nothing to get from the sheet, no facts/opions, clever techniques, just a webpage and an article on Wayne Rooney.  Tomorrow I just have RE and then it's the weekend, yay, should be good.
