I have been feeling pretty low after Pritam left for TCS, but since he is obviously getting along okay. Just for the record, it’s purely platonic feelings for him, I mean. Well why do I have to clarify ?? Well, seems that nobody can be trusted nowadays… just heard from a friend that her closest friend( another girl ), had suddenly developed some SPECIAL feelings for her which weren’t purely friendly. You can’t be too safe anywhere, can you…? Other then that, Debi called up. Debi who? Well he is one of my closest friends from college. We were pretty close together. Our group was mainly Debi, DD, AD and me. We shared some pretty good time together. We had lost touch with Debi some time back, but it was great to hear from him.  Besides, workload is heavy at the office and it’s getting pretty hard to balance things, but I am managing. Not much else really to say… Good bye and God Bless
