It'd be with kids from the ago of like 6 to 11, and for most of the day. I could expect just over minimum wage, and an eventual meltdown from over-exposure to adolescence. One problem with that plan is that since applying, I've signed up for a film course over the summer at the high-school. This will occupy my days from 9 until 3 for the whole month of July. I've also made a commitment to my dad to assist in the construction of a second house up at the camp in Maine during August. So my options come down to this;  A) Damn kids and canceling my visit to the great open North and Film County, USA, or B) No damn kids, some worthwhile education, and a great time with the pops.  No doubt, I'll go with the film and construction. The point of the story, is that I was given a job, I'm going to decline it as soon as possible, but I was still given a job. I hope my mom takes this the same way. I'll also most likely make more working for my dad for two weeks, than I would working for the Baird for a month.  Of course all this talk of jobs and money is just so I can pay for my car insurance. Most of my friends' parents will be paying for theirs, but not me. I guess $800 a year isn't that bad though, and it is giving me a more realistic idea of what paying for my own expenses is like. Also, without it, I'd never get to  drive .  I certainly didn't expect the lead singer from Harvey Danger to look like such a damn  urlLink nerd . Same thing with the guy from Barenaked Ladies. Didn't anyone tell them that you can't wear glasses and have parted hair unless it's a cruel joke?  Here's concept for a film/video. The screen is split in half, either top/bottom, or left/right, and it is two different little stories in each. The thing that connects them though is that they both have the exact same camera movements, and they're perfectly synced up. So for example, while one is panning left across a scene of a crowd milling about outside a train station, the other is panning left following somebody walking down a hallway. Then, at the exact same moment, both cameras stop panning and turn right sharply. It might be impossible for me to make, but I like to imagine it could work, and that the two stories would be interesting. It also demands an awesome sound-track.  Today I'm supposed to be working on my final projects for both Spanish and physics, but instead I'm just taking naps and eating. I've also started taking things apart, like transformers toys and my Super Nintendo. Luckily, I was able to put the SNES back together with no harm done, but the decepticon wasn't so lucky...
