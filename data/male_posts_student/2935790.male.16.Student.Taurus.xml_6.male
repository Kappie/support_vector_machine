The 'on the spot' questions with contestants are more fake than wrestling, and worse acting than 'orno. I answered every question within like, the first couple seconds, and I used the rest of the time to think about how stupid Americans are, sitting at home crappin' themselves over the right answer. I've taken real I.Q. tests, the kind you pay money for, the real kind, and some people portray the show as if it were a 'real I.Q. test'. It's not, it's just not. Don't be gay, don't watch the show, unless you feel like barfing all over your TV.   Dissapointed in the human race,  Sean
