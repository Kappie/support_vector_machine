(am i crazy, yet?) i'll explain it in more detail.  i'm sure everyone has had that sensation when they are waking up; you get excited to drive your new car, or spend all your million$ of dollar$. then, reality crashes in and you're back to your crappy life. (right?)  for me, it goes a little deeper. i have actually been in dreams and been reminded of ppl and locations FROM OTHER DREAMS. but those things do not exist! i have had dreams where i interact with close friends, but they are not real ppl i know. i have even had fake girlfriends, and even been reminded, in dreams, of ex-dream-girlfriends! when i wake up, i do not know who any of the ppl were, even though i can picture their faces and stuff. every couple of nights, i will go back to that neighborhood and hang out with my fake friends again. and of course, there are dozens of other identities and locations, which i revisit time and again. this has gone on for years. i have all these different alterego universes...in my subconcious.  so, basically my mind is using valuable memory space to store all these scenarios. and they are linear. let's say i dream about trying to find a job in suburbland on monday. the next night, i'll be in warriorland with its storyline and identity. some time later, i'll dream about suburbland again, and pick up where i left off. this time, i'll be at a job interview, as though no time has passed! what is that all about?! i mean, in all these dream lives, i have a specific personality with habits, memories, and motivators. why does my mind feel the need to file all of these character traits? is it really necessary for these dream lives to have a past? especially when i usually have lucidity and understand that it is a dream and not real, while it is taking place. i knew a native american woman who told me that when she dreamed, she would watch someone else's life unfold. she said it was part of her culture, and she could even choose a specific person to inhabit ahead of time. she also claimed that she could control their actions, and mess up their day if they had pissed her off. is that real? maybe when ppl on the other side of earth are sleeping, one of them is passively watching my life, and it does not make sense to them. perhaps, i am not who i think i am, but only a drifting spirit who is in this body today and must act accordingly to my prefabricated personality? does any of this make sense, or does it sound like the rantings of a crazy person? i have tried to understand this for some time. do you dream like this?
