I'm a big fan of Ed Norton, from films such as Fight Club, Primal Fear, The Score, The Italian Job and others.  So despite this being a Spike Lee movie, I decided to give it a go.  I was entranced by this film.  It was art.  The use of the camera, the power of the soundtrack, and the near hypnotic quality of one particular voice over at the end was just masterful.  This was an Oscar quality film, and I'm surprised it wasn't recognized.  According to  urlLink BoxOffice Mojo  the film did a measly $23 million on a $5 million budget.  Sure, it made money, but it should have had a wider viewing.  This is not a film with a real plot in the regular sense.  It is a one night examination of the moral structure of three friends, a father and a girlfriend as they try to cope with the fact that Norton's character will be reporting to prison in the morning for a seven year stretch after being busted for heroin dealing.  The underlying commonality of each character revolves around their lip service to rules.  Each seems to think that rules exist, but when push comes to shove, they can break them without being all that concerned.    It's a long movie, clocking in at over two hours, and it might seem slow at times, but like many good movies, the real action is in what is NOT said.  The interest lies in watching the characters hesitate, clearly choosing their path, yet seeing an acknowledgement that this isn't good...but I'm going to do it anyway.  The movie plays over the backdrop of the World Trade Center, after the collapse.  In one scene, Barry Pepper's bond trader character is in his apartment, with a direct overview of the Crater.  He comments that they could bring down as many buildings as they want, but he isn't moving - he worked hard for this place, and he isn't going to be inconvenienced on the account of others.  His entire attitude suggests that the Crater, for him, is nothing more than a nuisance, devoid of any meaning outside of himself.  I highly recommend the film.  Pay attention to the music and how it sets the tone.  I'm not ready to sample other Spike Lee films, but he certainly impressed me with this one.
