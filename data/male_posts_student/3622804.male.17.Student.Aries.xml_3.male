Today was just a really really BORING lecture by Mrs. Aileen Williams, former malaysian citizen, married to an Aussie guy, hence the name.  Anyway, me and Sean were like half asleep during her class... so borrrrrrrringggggggg Zzzzzzzzzzz.  People were saying i had bad breath.... (not my fault.. mum gave me garlic bread for breakfast...) so Sean gave me some breathmints.. the garlic was even stronger than the CK cologne i was wearing.. XDXD  Then did some maths involving Matrixes... or wateva.. My maths has improved to the point where ppl are actually asking me for help... XD  Gosu gosu gosu... wahahahah  Then went to computer lab again, where i saw these really lousy half life players... wanted to woop them but no coms... :( then mum picks me up from school and here i am awaiting ZZ and Mellie to come online... so bored...
