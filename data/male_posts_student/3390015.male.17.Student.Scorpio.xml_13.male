The Wolves were both mentally and physically drained from their emotional Game 7 victory less than two short days ago.  On Sunday, they will be rested and focused and the Lakers better watch out!  On a lighter note, only two half days and three exams away from freedom and the end of yet another school year.  Three down, one year to go.
