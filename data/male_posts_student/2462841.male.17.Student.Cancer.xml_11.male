I also reckon kde users don't fully support the opensource movement, as they use a desktop environment which mimics windows. On the other hand  urlLink gnome  is different from windows, and doesn't come with a default config to look/act like windows. The difference between the two is that kde has more support and more users, because there are more people in the world who want linux, but don't want to learn linux while the gnome camp has a smaller user base, yet has more applications, because its users are more inclined to contribute back to the opensource community. I also believe this is why  urlLink wxwidgets  chose to use gtk as their native toolkit for linux rather than qt.
