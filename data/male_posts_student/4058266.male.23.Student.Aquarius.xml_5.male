(Yesterday I did buy something =D) Well, anyways... I was standing in front of the shirts and some guy walks up to me and asks me if I could grab him a "Trust me, I'm a doctor" shirt. I looked at him and said "Um... I don't know bro, you probably have a longer reach than I do." He looked at me with a confused face about to say something but then I said "Dude, I don't work here." He said "Oh you don't?" and then he got it himself. Man... This guy is a little bit taller than I am but still wanted someone else to grab his shirt. I swear some people are just soooo lazy!
