By the time I'd got up, had breakfast, done the washing and so on, it was 11, so I got about an hour of revision in before lunch. I then spent three hours alternating between playing  FIFA Football 2004  and revising Geography. The rest of the day has just been spent sitting around doing not a lot. Oh well, tomorrow is marked down as 'Pure Maths Revision'. The fun.  Work phoned up and asked if I could do Sunday and I said 'no' because I had to do revision. They phoned back again and asked if I could do Bank Holiday Monday (double pay) and I agreed. I'm such a sucker for money, ha. Talking of money, grandma phoned me up this morning and said that she'd deposit some money in my account for my trip to Poland in September, which I thought was nice. I'll be going there for only a week or so, but it's going to cost £350. My parents have put £175 towards it and I have to pay the rest of the money.  My mum also mentioned to me that I "should take lots of pictures", to which I responded, "what, which my invisible camera?" You see, I have no camera, but plan on buying one for my gap year in autumn 2005. I might just buy a camera this autumn though and face the fact that it'll be out of date by the time I leave for Australasia.
