At precisely 12:15PM yesterday afternoon (I say yesterday, but we are only 2 and a half hours into today)- during the news on channel 4 (oh no big loss there eh?) the power went off. I went home at about 3, thinking that the power would be on at the top of the village which is miles from my grandads. Claverings electric was on (the housing estate inbetween) and the bottom of the village but- my street, no luck. I've been amusing my cousin all day so I didn't have any dire need for electricity, but then he went home. So I went for a ride out on my bike- this is about 7:00PM btw. I discovered, much to my amusement, articles Grrr1, 2 and 3. (Yes, I just happened to have my camera with me).   As we can see, Grrr1 shows that, in the event of a prolonged period of no electricity (thats about once every two months where I live) the mysterious little 'Hartlepool Water Pumping Station' hut near my street (which is on the top of a hill), attracts a little bald man (sadly not in the picture) brandishing a red petrol can and a bag of spanners. So, the little hut gets its own electric, eh?  Grrr2 shows that, in the afore mentioned event, EVERYWHERE ELSE BUT MY STREET OF 7 SEMI-D's (14 houses) gets its own generator. Before our street (they normally just forget about us). The blokes were hooking that generator to about 5 bungalows and 4 street lights, there.  Grrr3 backs up my point. That generator managed to power a whole 300m of street lighting and Mr Davisons farm (who was at the pub with my mam and dad at the time, there was only his wife and a barn full of poultry actually there). At 7:00 some NEDL bloke told me that our gen was coming over from Doncaster and would be installed within the hour.   After boiling water for cups of tea, heating some soup and making some bacon sarnies on our small gas camping stove (see the last picture) by light of some candles and a light I wired to an old car battery I found in the garage, and also after we all went to bed, the electric came back on at 12:15AM (a few hours ago). So then I came on the computer and ridded myself of the electronic cravings that had built up inside me (these were not extinguished by listening to the undertones and some weird 70s punk music on my ancient 'personal' CD player).   Heyyy we have my 5 (or 6?!) year old cousin coming again tomorrow. At half 8 AM! Oh god no I'll have to get up :-(   Oh- some news! I've aquired the Euro Blogs webring. Don't have a clue what I'm on about? Shame. Click 'Euro Blogs' on the right of this post! If you have a blog you european lunatic, join it. Cheers. Bye bye, aurevoir, auf weidersehen- tschoos! (Or something like that)...
