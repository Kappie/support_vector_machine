As Pakistan batted both the openers missed out on scoring but a huge third wicket partnership allowed Pakistan to post a mammoth score of 343.   During Hong Kongâ€™s batting, Pakistan tried to play a grandfatherly role by allowing the underlings to play, bowling with part timers like Imran Nazir and Imran Farhat. Interestingly Farhat ended up with the best figures at the end.   As for the reward I got for criticizing the commentators, there was no transmission during the first innings, officially due to technical glitches.
