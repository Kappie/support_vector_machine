Last night Chris Michaelis slept over. This morning Chris told me that last night he was talking to Renegade something (Dave D) and he asked me what he should say to him and me being half asleep, half awake, actually it was more like 3/4 sleeping... anyways I told him "In a million years from now, you'll be in good hands, cheddar cheese." So Chris decided to put the away message as 'Nacho Cheese....' and of course everyone was all like WHAT?! In the morning Chris and I had a huge sleeping bag war and I won! I got him pinned like 20 times. The game is you go in a sleeping bag headfirst so you can't see anything. Then you attack one another, yea it was dangerous, I fell down the steps. Right, so I had a track invitational at home from 3 pm to 9:30 pm, INSANE but luckily it was home. I came home, helped my mom walk the neighbors dog (Pepper) just in the backyard for like 2 seconds and then back in, went online, laughed, jumped on my bed, and did a dance. Oh yea, I also found out who Domokun is from some people, this brown awesome dude.
