Whereas Austin is Austin, Round Rock is Round Rock, Arlington is Arlington, and Fayetteville is Fayetteville, most everything around San Diego is part of San Diego.  Mesa, El Cajon, Carmel Mountain, La Jolla, Del Mar...different school districts, and I'm sure there is issue with public service and the like, but it all goes into the San Diego census.  So San Diego is the sixth largest city in the US, but there is no true surrounding area to talk to; its metro area is a small bit larger than its city, so it's honestly maybe the 20th largest city in the US.    We went to a bar in RB called the Instant Replay; Colin and Mike say it's always been there, right next to the Edelweiss Bakery and Dicrenzensio's Deli (two Westwood Shopping Village favorites of mine from the 1980s; the RB Sports Shop on the other side of the fashionable strip mall used to make the best knock-off gatorade to touch human lips; I'm sure they mixed in quaaludes).  But I'd never been.  The place looks like a small version of Austin's Showdown Saloon, and the bartender just moved from the 183 area (working at a bar called the Castrated Cattle or something).  Both Instant Replay and the Showdown feature Big Buck Hunter, one of the greatest drunken video games available to play, where you grab a sticky orange gun off the console and fire at deer on screen; when you hit one, you get an instant replay and even commentary from a "pro hunter" or something... that deer had no chance, shot right in the neck with precision .  Some guy who I don't remember, but he makes money in the internet world and wants to start a website to sell knock-off Starbucks items, owned the game, with finesse shooting and conservative bullet usgae.  Colin and I sucked, with Colin the better of the bad.  "This is why liberal arts folks shouldn't carry guns," he said, and we drank to Karl Strauss, San Diego's version of Shiner Bock beer.  I always want to explore San Diego when I come into town; nothing against the family, but at 23 (or 21, or 16), I'm not too keen on heading out to the Gaslamp District with my dad or grandparents, looking for drinks and conversation and unattainable action.  But my friends don't know the city.  They know Rancho Bernardo/Poway/Escondido.  I'm impressed that they've opened their eyes to the wonders of Mira Mesa, but we're still talking 15 miles north of SD proper.  And while all of us have expressed interest in seeing what San Diego has to offer, we've never done it.  Pool at Instant Replay or any other 50 cent table bar in town seems to win out, not to mention that Colin owns one of the greatest video game collections known to man, and he lives in one of the few white trash sections of San Diego, which is just worth visiting to wash away the skin of SoCal pretention that comes with any visit.    I am on the internet at this late point in the morning because when I woke up to log on, the phone service was disconnected.  My dad is a fan of living a high class lifestyle on a workless budget; we ate a $30 lunch yesterday, but he doesn't have phone service today.  We'll probably play golf today or tomorrow, but his debt is much larger than I'd ever like to admit.  A witty comment would fit here, but I'm not sure if this is witty or just sad.  And it's neither...it's just the way things are with him.  I see my parents both twice a year, during the summer and during Christmas, giving one two weeks and another one week.  This allows them to grow quite old while I'm not around.  I used to come and visit and want to lounge around, take time off and not worry about working or doing anything strenuous.  These days, I want to clean, paint, fix problems, and get both of them on some sort of course, rather than the obligatory "I need to get to that."    Too nice outside to be on the blog...a crazy dream about my roommate getting stoned and drunk and driving me around, and driving into a Vice City-esque Little Haiti (but Chinese), expecting me to get the car out of there.  He told me to go inside the house and I did, and I fell asleep, and woke up and he was gone and I had to run six miles home.  I was pissed when I got there, probably because I didn't have the Uzi-9 in case I ran into the Cubans.
