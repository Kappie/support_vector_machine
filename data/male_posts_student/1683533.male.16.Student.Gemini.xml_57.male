There is still no proof of "weapons of mass destruction" in Iraq, here is a recent column in  urlLink punk voter.com :  "For those of you not in the know, it has been recently discovered that Bush cited documents that "proved" Iraq was actively seeking materials for making a nuclear weapon. It turned out that the documents were forged. The fact that our President used false information to spur military action is unsettling to say the least; and there should be some serious inquiries as to what motivated the use false information. Clinton was fully investigated for lying about a sexual relationship, shouldn't there be an equally thorough investigation of Bush for lying to Congress about the urgency of attacking Iraq? No one ever got killed from a blowjob, but hundreds of Americans and thousands of Iraqis died as a result of Bush's fictitious war. Things have gotten so bad that even the corporate media is starting to wonder about Bush Jr.'s credibility. Here's what CNN has reported:    urlLink click here  "  -taken from  urlLink Punkvoter.com   4. He says some pretty stupid shit...for example:     "Arbolist...Look up the word.

Beaverton, OR 9/29/00   "I understand small business growth. I was one."  New York, NY 2/19/00   "Natural gas is hemispheric. I like to call it hemispheric in nature because it is a product that we can find in our neighborhoods."  Austin, Texas 12/20/00   "If affirmative action means what I just described, what I'm for, then I'm for it."  St. Louis, MO 10/18/00   "This is Preservation Month.

Dallas, TX 5/10/00    (Note: Yes, everybody says stupid things...but you got to admit...this is all stuff that got caught in the media...imagine how much stupid shit he says off cameras...)  5.He cut a half a BILLION dollars from the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget. Who needs to look after the environment when there’s all that oil drilling going on?   6.He approved a bill that denies financial aid to students convicted of misdemeanor drug charges (though convicted murderers are still eligible for financial aid). ...it's kinda ironic seeing that he did drugs....  7.He wouldn’t sign the Kyoto Protocol agreement on global warming, which was ultimately signed by 178 other countries. He also told the entire European community that he would listen to their arguments, but he would not change his mind, effectively treating Europe like an 8 year old child. This may have something to do with why most of the world hates the US.   8.He provided every member of the Bin Laden family living in the U.S. a chartered plane shortly after 9/11 to fly back home to Saudi Arabia without questioning them. One of GW’s first petroleum venture was partnered with the Bin Laden family and George Sr. has been getting filthy rich selling defense contracts to the Bin Ladens. These are just some examples of the many ties the Bush family has with the Bin Ladens.   9. He recently sent a delegation to the UN children’s summit to declare that the use of condoms is not a valid way to fight AIDS and that abstinence is the only solution. This is the view shared by some other countries such as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Syria, and the Vatican.   10. International Plan for Cleaner Energy: G-8 group of industrial nations (US, Canada, Japan, Russia, Germany, France, Italy, UK), July 2001: the US was the only one to oppose it.   11. September 2001: he withdrew from International Conference on Racism, bringing together 163 countries in Durban, South Africa   12. He refused to join 123 nations pledged to ban the use and production of anti-personnel bombs and mines, February 2001   I may be editing this with more reasons....I can't wait to see this guy out of office...I wish I could vote...Note: I got much of this info from   urlLink punkvoter.com  a site created by Fat Mike from NOFX...this has got to be the most in depth rant I have had yet....Much thanks once again to punkvoter.com.....I would be very happy if all of you that read this blog(...and that means just about nobody I bet...) learned something today...and maybe you hate the president at least a little bit....I mean c'mon...the dude can't even read....
