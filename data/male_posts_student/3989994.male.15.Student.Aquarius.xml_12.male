Ok so there were people and stuff so it was fun for like the first 1 or 2 hours but then later it became boring since there was not much to do... The people there were mostly girls and i did not know them so...the conversation was rather stilted. Mostly introductions, the people i knew were few only michael and Valerie and the host...racheal.      I was not feeling to good anyways, i don't know but i have been awfully grumpy these past few days, annoyed or angry i am not quite sure... possibly PMS...but i am a guy.          Hated yesterday...the racial harmony celebration was comparable to staring at the wall...yes it was darn boring. And even worse, lessons were carried on as per normal.     I had the stupid math test which i so know i flunked.     I knew how to do the question but a misinterpretaion of the question and i drew my graph inversed! it was blooming upside down! I just give up...Like as if things can't get worst my bloody leg hurts!          Grumpy and annoyed     byrOn
