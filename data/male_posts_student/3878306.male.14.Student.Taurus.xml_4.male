I know some things but I don’t know what Tarah feels if I know. Did she want me to know? She didn’t mention it. So you I know. I wish Tarah would of told me but all right. I went to the dentist office today and in two weeks my braces comes off. I’m so happy. Today they broke the metal things that were on the top back teeth. Drilled those babies right off. And broke the teeth guard on the back of the front teeth. Then I had to get a new imprint. This means tasteless pink stuff pushed on your teeth to make a make this way they can make a retainer. Good thing this time it was only on the top teeth. My mom and me went to Bedford café and ate club sandwiches. (Yummy) then we crossed the street to the supermarket. When we got home my I decided to choose my clothes for Walt Disney. I have a nice luggage. 7 shirts 5 pant 5 boxers 1 sneakers 1 sandals 1 bathing suit. That’s about it. Since my mom doesn’t let me put on new clothes until the trip she noticed she had too much clothes so I can put clothes I’m not taking with me. Crappy thing Michael left today to Florida. I mean he could have lived here but he rather roams free in Florida. I talked to Jessica today she’s really annoying me, I’m not calling her anymore. I talked to Kristina today instead. I miss talking to Kristina, her and her boyfriend and their problems. Not really problems but anyway we talked for a long time mostly about nothing but it wax nice. She’s leaving to D.R. Monday and she’s a little afraid of planes and turbulences and this is beside the point she doesn’t want to leave her boyfriend but he’s going over there too so I don’t see what’s the problem. I really like Tarah and I’m telling her in an email. I think she likes me too
