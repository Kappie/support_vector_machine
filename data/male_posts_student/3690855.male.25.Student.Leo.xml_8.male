I have no doubt in my mind that it sucked, but I have the option to rewrite it, and I will do so.  I was just trying to get it complete instead of putting forth my best possible effort, knowing I'd be given a rewrite option, so I didn't give it the full college try (which you think I would, considering I'm in college and all, but...that's another story).  I've had my radio show, which has had its ups and downs.  We had Grim in studio two weeks ago, and he added a different dimension that the show didn't have before.  We'll see if he makes any other appearances.  I'd wager he would, but he didn't make it last week and I've been unable to contact him for this week, so we'll see.  By the way, if you read this and want to listen, my timeslot was moved to 12-3 on Thursdays.  In addition, I have added a Sunday shift as well from 3-6 PM, if I can get access to the building this week.  Last week, I went to do my show and couldn't get into the building.  Not having been given instructions on how to get in when the building is closed, I didn't know what to do so I went home.  Hopefully, we'll have that issue cleared up for this weekend.  Let's see, what else...my 4th of July weekend kinda sucked.  I didn't do anything.  I've been working some.  Work hasn't gotten much better, but I'm kind of learning to deal with it.  Other than the paper and the radio show, nothing of importance to note about school.  Home life has been weird.  My dad has been having issues of late.  I hope he isn't drinking again, but I'm not so sure.  For some reason, he isn't home tonight.  I just got home from work, so I have no idea if he and my mom had a fight or whatever, but he definitely is not home.  Before I left for work, he was ragging about this and that.  I think he might have started drinking frequently again, but I can't prove it.  I really hope I'm wrong.  Weekend plans?  I'm trying to talk Jeff into going to the Ring of Honor show in Elizabeth, but I'm not sure he's buying that.  Grim probably won't go either, so I wouldn't be surprised if I went by myself.  Ugh.  Going to independent wrestling shows on a Saturday night by yourself = Bad.  Going to ROH shows, with ROH fans filling the building pretending matches are Match of the Year candidates when they clearly aren't by yourself = Really bad.  Still, I have nothing else to do, and I don't want to spend it at home, and Jeff wants to go to 3PW, and they suck, so ROH is likely what is in store for me.  May God have mercy on my soul.  That's all for now.  Nobody left any feedback for the last blog item, so I'm assuming that I'm writing these all for myself.  I can deal with that.  That means I can bury more people.  But I will ask this in my blog tonight.  Can anybody think of a more constructive way for me to spend my Saturday evening, keeping in mind that most of my friends will likely not want to do anything and that no matter what, I'm spending it by myself?  If you can and I like the idea, I may just use it and give you credit in the next blog update.  But I doubt anybody will respond to this, so...touche.  Word out.
