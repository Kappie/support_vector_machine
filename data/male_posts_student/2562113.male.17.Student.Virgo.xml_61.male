Today I looked over my transcript and found out that my 3 SUPA Economics credits from Syracuse University transferred!!! I had a 4.0 in that class, boosting my current cumulative GPA up to 3.70! Mr. Galati is the man for offering that class!!!  Upon finding this out, I immediately dropped Macroeconomics from my schedule and replaced it with Intro To Logic, which will fulfill my Gen Ed requirement in Humanities. Here's a look at my current schedule:   ACHM 120N (General Chemistry I)  Mon,Wed,Fri 2:30PM-3:50PM  ACHM 122A (General Chemistry Laboratory I)  Mon 1:00PM-4:00PM  AMAT 113 (Calculus II)  Mon,Wed,Thurs,Fri 3:35PM-4:30PM  APHI 210L (Introduction To Logic)  Tues,Thurs 11:15AM-12:35PM  APHY 150N (Physics II: Electromagnetism)  Tues,Thurs 9:45AM-11:05AM  UUNL 205 (Information Literacy)  Mon 5:45PM-7:45PM (starting March 12)  ...for a total of 15 credits this semester.  No classes till 2:30PM on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday! I'm a happy man! :D  Vernon just informed me that we might go to Sneaky Pete's tonight to get wasted, so I better bust out with my colored pencils and junior license and get to work!  -BIGsmut.
