This should be fun. Hopefully Brandon and I will be able to meet up with PM there.  I have to work today from 4 PM to 8 PM... I get the feeling that it won't be fun. I'm going to have to leave early to find parking. Then from what I understand, it'll be extremely busy.  I'm getting more and more things done on my redesigned website. Stay Tuned...  That's it from me. Not a whole lot is new with me, and I haven't had anything to rant about.  ***
