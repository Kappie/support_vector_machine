Hit the crossbar. (hence the  Crossbar  Game)  3. Shoot the ball into the net.  4. Volleys are worth 2 points, one bouncers are worth one.  5. First to three wins cash money.  This game is quite difficult.  The hardest part is hitting the crossbar and hitting in a way that it bounces back to you and not straight down or not over the goal.  I was very unsuccessful for the first hour, but after some good coaching from Pat, I got the hang of it rather quickly and almost got two points.  Blasted headers.  If I could have volleyed it I would have had a sure two points.  Oh well, I was shut out.  Can't wait 'till the next practice on Wednesday.
