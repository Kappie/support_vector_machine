I took the  urlLink  political compass  test today and found out that I am at a -4.15, -4.25 on the scale which makes me a collective anarchist (or communist libertarian, whichever you want to read it as) along with Ghandi, Nelson Mandela, and the Dalai Lama.  I think Im in good company on that one.
