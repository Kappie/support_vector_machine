And oh man, its like nothing you've ever tasted, for my non-durian eating friends.  You probably wouldn't like it.  Mainly because of the smell.  I think it smells odd, but its also sweet in its odor.  It tastes like.... I don't know... nuts, rum, banana (wtf?  I don't know), pudding, and some weird other thing I can't put my finger on.  Its definitely an acquired taste.  Good thing I have acquired it.  Its such a good thing.
