I drove one of these bad boys for the weekend and it has now become my new love.  Here's a list of what I would give up to have this...  1) Cursing *I swear!* 2) Video Games 3) My habit of eating out all the time 4) The 20lb's I've gained since ok 30lb's since I've met my wife 4 years ago. 5) Pestering my wife to have my babies 6) Pestering my wife for sex 7) Git N Go /Kum N Go *I swear that's their new name!* 8) Free Balling *yes I would start to wear undies* 9) Bad Posture 10) My braces!! OMIGOSH take these damned things off already.  Rob
