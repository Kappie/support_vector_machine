Anyway welcome to my blog....This being  my first post I thought I might share my brief life story with you.  I  was born in Hobart, Tasmania way back in '86.   Until I was 8 I lived  "high on a hill" up on Mt. Nelson, had a brillient childhood and went  to Mt. Nelson Primary school.  Bloody oath that school is tops.   Anyway, we had a good time there, lots of family holidays to Coles Bay  and visits up to the farm, then in 1994 or so we moved to Albion  Heights Drive.  I love my house so much, and we're still there.  I then  went to Friends' High School and now im in Clemes in Grade 12.  I have  my license, and my car, a 1987 Honda Civic, 1.5 L, 5 speed manual.   Little pocket rocket it is too.  Life is good.  Plans at the moment for  the future are as follows:  Finish school, do well, get a score close  to 90.  Then I will be off to England working a GAP year there.  I will  hopefully do this with school and go to another Quaker school outside  of London called Saffron Walden.  If thats not possible, I do have a  interview with GAP this friday, so hopefully one of those will work  out.  After my year away I will be back in Tassie, get my job back or  get another, then start my degree at University studing Agricultural  Science.....after that what will I do.....your guess is good as mine.
