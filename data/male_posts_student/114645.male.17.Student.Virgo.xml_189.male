If you haven't seen it yet, you should, and I just read a thing that says its first day it made an estimated $5 million!!!!! Take that George! Hahahahahaha! But yeah! I am probably going to see it again with Anton and maybe Leffner. Now my fav quote from the movie:   "If you fool me once, it's on ......................................... you. You can't fool me again!"
