(.. a hot chick thought i was some 27 yr old.... jeez i wonder what she was smoking.. .lol.. jp).. naw.. I unno.. I was jus bored.. Well of all the benefits of my job.. I barely use my ability to stay after work and watch previews.. Wondering why right now? REnts .. cuz of them i can't stay out that late.. EVEN @ work.. blah that.. o well. Still kinda pissed off cuz i could have gotten a ride home from a friend tooo.. GRRRRRR.. anywho.. Im scare.. Not even close to finished my cookbook for Foods Class( I KNOW YOU ALL ARE LAUGHING.. but i did need a social science or G3 credit.. so i chose foods.. thinking it was easy.. OO.. I should've have shot myself then:P.. lol..).. Foods is easy but LOTS of work @ the same time..Enough of my ranting. I haven't updated in a while cuz well LAziness, school ( figures) and mostly due to NEED FOR SPEED UNDERGROUND... ( BEST RACING GAME EVER!!)... Right now your either disagreeing w/ me  or saying WTF.. why does NFS UG matter to me.. but then again you are reading *MY* blog..  All in all today was pretty good I made CIP.. but for you guys that means absolutely nothing and thats good.. :P... hehehehe... (.. * evil smirk*..) ne way.. ppl. Im slightly tired.. gonna lve now.. PS Try the Submit a site and Feedback forms.. Wouldn't mind getting some ideas for the site.. and if anyone wants to make me a spiffy home pg.. ALL THE POWER TO YOU!:)  ColdAsFire Aka ACZ
