The sign read like this:     Yard Sale 318 East 1655 North Log Furniture,  Baby , Clothes  Let's see, I already have plenty of log furniture, I have clothes, but I could use a baby. Honestly, how could you not have picked that mistake up when you were writing it? Or double checking it? Or hanging it up? People are morons. That's all I have to say for today. Thanks for your time, I'll be here all week. Try the veal...
