     
      Back in April, I laughed at Tanya and Michael for using conditioner. But now I too have fallen victim to the conditioner craze. It just makes my hair a little nicer to me. A short little blurb, but all the same.  Also, my heart and sympathies go out to Tanya, who has lost a dear loved one. I'll be there for whatever you need Tanya.  Final Note: Cher is coming to Hamilton in August.
