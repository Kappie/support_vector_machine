So yes Mr. Six is defenatly a he, but he is not old.  all suspicians are covered except for...dun dun dun...race.  you can't really tell through the thick make-up jowls he has, but as her day progressed, his make-up began to wear off.  it soon became clear, Mr. Six is indeed, BROTHA SIX.  i should have know that a white person could not dance that well.  not even a chinesse person could do that.  oh well.
