Well, I think tonight at around 15 after midnight, one of my prayers was answered... or maybe God is giving me the terms for answering my prayers.  I haven't been feeling too well the past few days, I've had some bowel issues... but that's all you need to know for me to continue.  So I was going to the bathroom, and I wanted to take something to read with me... so I opened up a box of comic books, and what did I see?  The bible I was given by my church for graduating high school.  Now, I haven't been able to find this bible since I moved to Richmond, and I haven't looked at any of my comics... can you guess?  Since I moved to Richmond. That was over three years ago!!  Last week at my connection/small group meeting, I was challenged to start diving into scripture, to really learn from it, but I hadn't actually taken the plunge, yet.  I don't know if I should take this as some kind of clue or not.  I'm really not used to getting signals from God or anything, so I'm trying to be semi-objective... but I can't help but think that my prayer actually did something... but God wants a little more from me before I'm ready, I guess, to recieve more of his gifts.  Today starts a new day.
