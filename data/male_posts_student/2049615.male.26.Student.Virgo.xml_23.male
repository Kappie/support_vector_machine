Taking into account the fact that spending a full week alone in Bloomington with nothing to do but do actual schoolwork would have driven me mad, mad, mad I tell you, I took to the road with nothing but the clothes on my back, some personal hygeine supplies, and 1,900 pounds of Dodge Neon shrieking down the highway.  My quest for nothing in particular led me through five states, a pair of musical venues, and a whole fuckload of restaurants.    Monday, 15. March -- Dillinger Four@The Fireside Bowl, Chicago IL   I hate to sound like an asshole, but after so many years it's still ho, hum, another D4 show.  Back in the less-than-halcyon days of my youth in the frigid wastes of central Wisconsin (see below) I saw these guys many a time, often in various stages of public undress.  Then as now, the pop-inflected, gruff gallows-humored punk rock throwdown was in full effect.  They're good and all, but this wasn't really my bag then, and it's still not now.  If I were more comfortable rocking out with beer and kielbasa tightly in hand, things might be different.  There were three openers, and two I guess stood out.  Sweet JAP are a quartet of poppily spastic Minnesotans who while provoking quite the positive crowd reaction were lost on me.  Their album, which I heard in part later on the same day, was even poppier than their live appearance, and more rock-classicist besides.  The band that really got my attention at this show was the Tyrades, from Chicago.  Where the rest of the day's bands were loud, fast, angry, and melodic, the Tyrades are just fucking splenetic.  While so many bands in their position temper the punk rock with heavy metal in order to  convey the usual range of pissy emotions, the Tyrades just vomit forth electrocuting punk rock on par with Skull Kontrol.    Tuesday, 16. March   I went to  urlLink Soul Vegetarian  and  urlLink Metal Haven .  Within two hours of each other.  How's that for cognitive dissonance?    Tuesday, 16. March - Friday, 18. March   I always like driving in Wisconsin, even more so when it's still cold and there are periodic flurries like there were Tuesday night.  It's just so not Indiana.  My overall experience of Wisconsin this time was not positive, because I remained asleep on my parents' couch, sick with a mild mystery ailment, possibly  urlLink Nugent's Disease , for most of the week.  During my periodic bouts of consciousness I caught up with cable television and hung out with the folks.      Friday, 18.March -- Joan of Arc@The Triple Rock, Minneapolis MN   If there can truly be said to be any sort of overarching irony of the week it was that I drove to Chicago to see some bands from Minneapolis, and then drove to Minneapolis to see some bands from Chicago.  Those bands were Joan of Arc, Make Believe, and the Love of Everything, all of which share a substantial portion of their memberships with one another.  Evidently Friday was one of their birthdays, so there was some family in attendance and a cheesy group photo was posed for from stage during a later Joan of Arc number.  The Love of Everything was a reasonable proposition.  There was a great deal of sequencer frippery underpinning many of the songs, which filled them out nicely.  The tendency for one particular sequencer loop to manifest itself again and again led one concertgoer to threaten violence against the performers should he hear it again, but variety was the order of the day and no bones were broken.  Make Believe are a new Tim Kinsella-fronted band whose membership is essentially coterminous with that of Joan of Arc.  Make Believe are furthermore much better than Joan of Arc has been in a while, exhibiting more of the chunky rockiness of  How Memory Works -era JoA than the later stuff.  The songs were faster, and the playing and singing were more together than the Joan of Arc performance which was to follow, but you can probably chalk that up to some of the band having been on stage for two hours already by the start of their set.  Joan of Arc were also better than Joan of Arc have been in a long time, although they could have been better.  If you, like me, were one of the seven people still patient enough to actually buy  In Rape Fantasy And Terror Sex We Trust  then you'll know what you could have expected.  The first part of the set was good, but by the middle of the seemingly-infinite (probably more like fifteen-minute) version of "Shadow Government" (no shit, Tim Kinsella can actually remember  urlLink that entire list  without help) nobody in the now-peaked looking audience would ever mistake Tim's arrogance for shyness ever again.  Joan of Arc, in the later part of their set, showed signs that they are ready to disintegrate into a truly unpleasant folk-percussion based hippie jam ensemble, only without the marijuana;  a pair of new songs played as an encore helped to dispel that suspicion.
