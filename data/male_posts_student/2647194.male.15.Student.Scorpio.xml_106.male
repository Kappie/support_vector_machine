I went to Prescott to get some fireworks today...the real kind. That was pretty fun. However...  Shayl's in the hospital with a fractured skull and a bad blood clot near her brain. Results of a bike crash w/o a helmet. I wasn't there, and probably couldn't have done anything, but I for some reason could have expressed the importance of wearing a helmet. I'm a racer, so if I didn't wear a helmet: 1. I would be kicked off the team. 2. It wouldn't be possible to kick me off the team if I was dead. Crashes suck, but without a helmet they can be catastrophic.  How many teens have to get seriously hurt before people start wearing helmets?  No real happy note today, and I'm tired.  P.S. We're all pulling for you Shayl. Just hang on a little longer...
