I think I did really well, despite the fact that I basically learned a whole semester's worth of vocabulary in one sitting the day before. The essay I wrote was extremely well organized and structured, one of the things that Mr. Floyd likes the most. Hopefully I can count on a 50/50 on that part.  Lucky Martha didn't have an exam today, and unlucky me didn't get to see her. But I guess that gives me at least  one  reason to look forward to tomorrow, THE AP AMERICAN HISTORY EXAM. *thunder clap* So is it a bad thing if I haven't learned diddlysquat all year? Yeah, I thought so. The five hour (no joke) review session begins in eight minutes, so I had better get my empty head over there.  luv ya, Martha ;)
