I simply spent my day playing Winning Eleven 7, watching the television and chatting on msn messenger. Yea, today was basically a damn slack day. A lot of time was wasted on slacking and stuffs.  As u can see frm the tag board, the fat pussy cat used my name and stuffs. He always tries his best to irritate me. Haha, always saying I'm skinny when I'm thin and many other stuggs. Although he may seem to be a rather irritating guy who juz loves gettin on ppl's nerves, he's not like tt. Haha, I can't believe I'm saying this. Seriously, he's a nice and fun guy to be wif. I dun wish to elaborate further, ahaha. But in my eyes, he's still a fat pussy cat! L0L!  Well, nothing much happened today. It was a simply boring day! There's realli nothing to do or nobody to play wif when I'm at home. So yea, I think u shld noe by now how bored I actually am at home. Tt's y I'm always finding ppl to go out wif, whether it's juz for a dinner or a game of pool. Yea, tmr I'm hafing some 'o' lvl seminar at this RELC, so I hafta haf an early nite. Cya! =]
