There really isnt a 2, I'm just going to say some crap about the stories...just read and you will see.  Mikes story: In the land of the ancients, in the third age of the world, there lived a humble man, alone. He did not have kin, nor wife, nor children, and thus he jacked off his humble penis often As one day he walked through the meadow of the Wedoe, contemplating his troubles, a bearded negro approached him. He spoke to the dark man: "Why douth thou approacheth me, colleage?" for in those days, all men were colleages. The negro spoke slowly, and with much effort, and his beard shook as he spoke thus "You owe me three fitty." And thus said the humble man, "I have not three fitty, for I am humble" And the negro looked at him, and vanished, and in his place stood a terrible creature, at least the height of the tallest of the village buildings, and he was the loch ness monster. The humble man yelled in humble fear, and was soon-after humbly eaten.  What John has to say: Mike gets +12 points for talking about a sexual body part He gets -4 points for taking something from South Park He gets +35 for using the word "colleage" more than once Final score -74, F (not an average) Notes: Dude come on you totally said "three fitty" (man come up with your own weird way to say an amount of money)  Bekkas story: There once was a man from Bandu, Who fell asleep in a canoe. He dreamed of Venus, And played with his penis, And woke up with a hand full of goo.  What John has to say: Bekka gets +83 points for saying Bandu (such an awesome place) She gets -3 points for saying "goo" (you could have said something like poo and then the reader would say "what the fuck!?!?!") Final score +1, C (not an average) Notes: It was really Close to a F  Micas story: There once was a boy named john, he was a nut.  The end.  What John has to say: HOLY SHIT -3 POINTS FOR NOT CAPTILIZING MY NAME Final score N/A, F (not an average) Notes: I dont know why I bothered with this one  Petrs stroy: There was a gay guy named John Haltertop, and he liked males. Not just ordinary males, gay elephant males. However, he couldnt find one anywhere, so he went searchin, but all he could find was his fat gym teacher. so then he was wondering, and he was like “Man I could just go to the zoo.” And he did, and there he jumped the fence. Except he didnt read the sign that said it was the fence to the jail next to the zoo. so he was walking, and walking, and he couldnt find an elephant. So then he stopped where the inmates played and asked for directions. They told him to go to the showers and maybe he'll find one there. So he goes, and there a guys soap falls on the floor. John Haltertop bends over to pick it up, and we all know how the rest of that story goes. The End.  What John has to say: ... Final score .... Notes: Give Petr $12 tomorrow  The winner is....Bekka!
