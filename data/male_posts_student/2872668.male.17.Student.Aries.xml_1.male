There we were, stonin at the table in silence, unable to say anythin to each other. Perhaps we were ponderin about our memories abt her. But it was still a very awkward moment, and i wish we had talked cheerily abt kelly, instead of brooding to ourselves. It would be a consolation to her mom, at least.  Death. Is there anythin greater to be feared? I feel indignation whenever i see those interviews in newspapers n magazines and ppl say they're not afraid of death, that its all natural and everythin. Rather, the fear of death should be normal, and anyone who doesnt is either a liar, or dead by now. This fear propels us to survive in this world. Darwin said the need to survive initiated evolution. This can be rephrased to be the fear of death. This is what keeps us goin after our scholarships and distinctions, jobs and promotions. People fearin death invented seatbelts, researched HYVs, worked to earn money, and ate and drank.  I fear death. Yet even if it is all around us, we just have to keep livin and survivin. Rest in peace, fren. We'll be goin your path soon, too...   Hark! mere mortal,  dost thou fear of death? If thy answer be no, you surely speak in jest!  Thou wishst all of acquaintance good health and pain's immunity, to rest in peace upon the earth and lie in slumber for eternity.
