There are a few things about this that I find interesting, beyond the obvious glee at bagging another bad guy, even if he wasn't an active terrorist.  1).  This guy appeared in a video with Bin Laden in December 2001, where he praised Bin Laden on the 9/11 strike.  They gloated together for some time.  2).  This guy is paralyzed from the waist down, confined to a wheel chair.  3).  He turned himself in to the Saudi Embassy in Tehran, Iran.    Now, if Bin Laden is hanging out in the Afghan mountains through late 2001 and early 2002, how does this paralyzed elderly man get to a meeting with Bin Laden?  Strap him to a mule?  Or is it likely that Bin Laden was or is hanging out in the outskirts of Tehran?    What seems likely?  And by the way, I just noticed that this is post number 1,200 in the history of this blog.  I don't know if I should be proud or disturbed.
