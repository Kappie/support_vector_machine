I started this with the initial intension (alliteration) of it being an avenue of self expression and examination- (alliteration again). BUT! One thing I've learnt at CAP is that WE the writers write for YOU. So, bon appetite mon ami.  There's a lot to say. Firstly, about CAP (the camp I was at for the last week of the holidays). Well, if I'd blogged about it straight after the camp, I'd have so many intuitive things to say. Unfortunately, procrastination breeds memory loss. What I can remember is that I know I've come out a better person. This is the catch- I was the same person when I went in. So what happened inside was that I realized that I retained my value as a person. I'm still as funny, and I still know what my rights are, and I'm still able to fight for them. I'm who I was before, but better in the sense that I'm wiser about social interaction (hard knock lessons from college). The sad Tim's dissolving and The generally entertaining one's back. That's not all there is to me, but I'm happy that that facet of my being is back.  The people at CAP were great! They were friendly, open, and swore a lot less than the "Christians" at school. Have come out with many good friends. Denise, JJ, Nigel, Han, Jia Chuan, Wei Liang, Zealyn... Just to name a FEW mind you. I've met Jia Chuan again after 2 years and Zealyn again after about 11 years. Woah... yes... tell me about it. For those of you who are reading this and have not had your names mentioned, you are still on my mind. Babirusa, JC Drama, and all the other neat people I've met along the way.  The camp started out draggy, but it picked up along the way. I got closer and closer with my peers and got many commendations at the end. It made me a new person, or rather, the old person. Whatever lah. Oh! I was put into this workshop with a HIPPY art teacher. Damn man! "Feel the energy of the plant and connect with it. Feel the beautiful flow of connectivity children." And that's only the tip of the iceberg. I got put into another workshop. The drum clinic was definitely the best thing that happened to me there. Made friends with Kenny Hogan, one of SEA's best drummers. He had my mouth open. He asked me to do a solo gig with him on stage for the dinner, and I was like... wow.. and then we were talking outside and I told him that I was a singer and that I wanted to make entertainment my career and he asked me to sing on stage whilst he drummed. I was like *BLOWN AWAY*. I called Leon who was in M'sia and asked him for fever lyrics. AND ALL THIS WAS LIKE 15 MINUTES BEFORE THE GIG! WE DIDN'T PRACTICE, but the funny part about it was that I wasn't particularly concerned about that. Went up, did fever with one of the best drummers the region had to offer. Just the two of us. SURREAL! The audience LOVED it. Then the drumming bit came. Nigel was on the cowbell, I played snare and he played the set. AND IT FLOWED DAWG!!! Was commended many times after that with "wow Tim, didn't know you were so good". I was like what?! and I said thank you. OH MY GOSH READER! I'M SORRY, BUT I'M EXCITED THINKING ABOUT IT.  Babirusa was my group name. We were supposed to be called "the eleven and a half apostles" but we decided to scrap that and take control. We put on a little skit about the excursion we had at the night safari. It was mediocre, but that's because all the rest of the groups had the same ideas and memories. None the less, I love my babirusa! (Btw, babirusa is the name of the pig thing at the night safari. We were entertained my it, so we adopted it's name). JC Drama started out slow. I have learnt the magic of sound- scapes and tableaux (is that how you spell it?). Made many friends with the Hwa Chong'ers there. They're great... most of them. Pretty people. Miss them to death. I got put into this artsy thing where 4 girls and myself created the poem (below - Rythms of nature) from our individual poems and put movement to it. It was hard working with the girls coz some were you know... inhibited... but that's alright. It was great working with lovely people like themselves. The other two groups which were in JC drama put on very entertaining pieces from very boring scripts. CHEERS TO YOU GUYS! Hats off... really. I can only hope we stick together, but then again, year after year, everyone hopes for the same thing. Pre-u sem or cap.. the numbers will dwindle. The inevitable is inevitable. There are so many things to write about but I've covered the 3 things I wanted to cover. However, no vast amount of writing will ever do true justice to what I wish to express. My gratitude, sentiments and love overwhelm me currently. I feel sad that I can't write about everything. So many people, I miss the way we used to play with Khalwat patrol. We were so desperate to study, that Han, Bernie and I snuck tot he toilet to study. But we were caught there too... so we had to go back to sleep. I was really inspired my them. I want to start writing seriously. It's in me I think and I can hope to become better at it.  The exams are finally over and I'm chilling these few days. Developments on love front. I've decided that it's too dangerous to like anyone, so I won't coz it will turn out badly in the end. Sad. I know.  Joe just played sacrificial lamb for me. She's getting blasted in school. Thank you Jo. I'll call you tonight. I'm upset that this had to happen but I have my own life and drama's going to have to realize that, but they won't coz things are going to have to be done their way. I mean, they can't contact you the night before and expect you to change your plans just when you've just finished your exams! THAT'S RIDICULOUS! Unfortunately, that's the way it is there. I thought things would change when I joined drama... I was wrong. ACJC's ACJC wherever you are weather you like it or not. I'll just have to deal. At least I know that I'm not inapt ont he social front. It's just  some  of my classmates who are jackasses. And if you're one of them and you're reading this and you're not happy, lets get it on then.  Till the next entry then. I'll be telling you about the things I learnt at CAP as well as other great stuff about the 1AA1'ers. Later.
