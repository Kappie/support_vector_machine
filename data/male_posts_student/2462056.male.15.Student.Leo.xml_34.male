Yeah so.. damn I haven't updated this thing since Warped Tour, that's crazy.  Well now that Warped '04 is over, I'm looking forward to Warped '05.  Oh, and If anyone has the Billy Talent CD, I'll love you (long time) if you copy it for me.  Well nevermind, I decided to buy it off of iTunes, thanks anyways.  So yeah, since Warped Tour I went to a LAN on Friday night at Phillip's house, stayed up pretty much all night again playing CS and messing around and getting hyper as hell on energy drinks.  LAN parties are so fun, especially when we set them up ourselves, because then we don't have to pay for stuff, like we would have to at eBaang.  Well yeah, they do have machines that are like, 20 times better than the ones we use, and the internet is a lot faster, but oh well.  My parents went out of town from Saturday morning until Sunday evening.  During that time my brother came over and took me and Lacy out to eat, and my cousin came too.  Nothing like Chimi Changas from Laredo's.  We came home, my brother went and got his N64, and we ended up staying up until about 1:30 playing Mario Tennis, which is one of the most addicting N64 games on the planet.  It was very fun though.  My cousin left after that, sister went to bed, and I stayed up and watched James play Starfox for Gamecube.  Great night.  Didn't do anything on Sunday, except sleep, until like, 1.  I got up, did some more nothing.... and again today I have done nothing.  Yep.  Sorry for everyone that has problems, and I hope they all get fixed!
