Well, I'm just at home now merely brainstorming about all the stuff that I need to find and obtain for this trip.  It's coming up pretty soon, and it sure is awfully exciting now, isn't it?  It'll be awesome, and all I have to worry about now is not forgetting anything.  I say overpack.  My luck will probably leave me without any underwear! lol.  Well good luck to everyone else as you go through this packing adventure!
