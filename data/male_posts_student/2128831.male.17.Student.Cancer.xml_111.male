Kelly:  Congratulations, my friend.  I bow to your courage which is superior to my own.  Today's aphorism, and another useless tagline from the past.   "Bring a sequinned hat and make a little money."  "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature." It's one of those days when I have nothing to say. I mean, like, absolutely nothing to say. It'd be nice to have at least one thing to say, but no. I got nothin'. See? Oh well. The cat scratched my eyelid the other day and lived to tell the tale. I think it was because my eye was twitching in my sleep. I'm sure that twitch has nothing to do with me.     Your yoga stretch for the day.  Sit up straight, knees slightly apart. Clasp your hands together, and put them between your knees. Next, push your shoulders up and begin curling your upper body over to stretch out your spine, then squeeze your elbows into your waist, as if you are cold. Keep curling until you can't curl anymore, comfortably. As you enjoy the stretch, you will hear something similar to the breaking of a stick of chalk, a quick grind and snap in your neck. Oh muther @#$%ing ouch, that really hurts. So never mind then, don't try this at home alone.   Ayyyah!  The United States Supreme Court today will consider the case of the Pledge of Allegiance, or, more specifically, whether the phrase “under God” in the pledge violates the country’s Constitutionally-mandated separation of church and state. I am not at all certain why the Supreme Court is taking up the matter, as it doesn’t appear that the Pledge was ever mandated by any municipal, state or federal law. Nevertheless, I refuse to recite the Pledge ... although the reasons aren’t premised entirely upon my disdain for organized religion.  On April 19, 1942, in response to war-time hysteria brought about by the allegedly surprise bombing by Japanese imperial forces of Pearl Harbor, then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the forced removal of 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast of the United States. The Order decreed that anyone with as little as 1/16 Japanese blood was subject to evacuation, and that they leave their residences within 48 hours taking only what they could carry by hand. For the duration of the war, life for these evacuees would be eked out in a 10’ x 20’ space in tar-paper barracks, strategically located on the most desolate lands of the U.S interior, including Death Valley. But despite the fact that not one individual of those imprisoned was ever been found guilty of a war crime or espionage, the Supreme Court determined that the U.S. government acted properly. That random abrogation of Constitutionally-guaranteed civil rights -- just one of many in the U.S. and all for no better reason than unfounded fear -- demonstrates unequivocally that neither loyalty oath nor pledge will save my ass from the whim of government or its God.
