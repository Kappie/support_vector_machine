When i reached school, someone came to me and told me that later in the afternoon will have a photo session. I was like "what the hell??? Mr Ang didn't even tell us!!! oh no!!! my hair!!!" Thank goodness Shi Kai brought his stick wax to school... The whole class eventually spent the whole day during lesson talking bout the photo taking session... I think its me and Aisyah who talk the most about it...   When the bell rang, signalling the end of the class of the day, we dashed out of the class room and went to the toilet and style our hair... When i came out of the fourth floor toilet, i looked down... Then i saw Kian Peng they all at the 2nd floor, first floor i believed dominated by Ivan they all and a few dominated the third floor... I was like " hey, now then i realised that my class 4E5 is the most vain class of all!!!" even my assistant monitress asked this:"did you guys practice smiling???" she was the least vain person i knew on earth and she eventually said that!  Well i am also surprised that i passeed my second mock exam! I never ever have the thought that i would pass it... Perhaps it was just a dream... But it will be a very nice one... Hehe... Better don't say anymore... Later people would critisise me again...  The next thing i am going to say is going to make me feel irritated and shameful... We (Gerald, Marianne and Ling Feng) were walking home, when sudden;y me and gerald got into a "fight"... He start messing ym hair and i tried to mess his hair for revenge... Then he started to run off and i start to give him a chase... After running for a few distant, i realised that i have landed onto the floor... I had slip and fall upon a puddle of water!!! Then i felt a very painful sensation starts dwelling aroung my knees... In stead of help me up , Gerald started to laugh and run off again! When i stood up, i saw white patches one my pants... I tried to use some water to wash it away, unfortunately it didn't came off... i believed that its worn out at the moment when i fall... Untill now, my knee cap and my wrist still hurts... Let's hope that nothing will go wrong with them or else there won't be any one who is able to help my mum!  Gerald!!! I swear that tomorrow you will get it from me!!! Thanks for nothing!!! To think i still treat you as my good friend yet you ran away and broke into laughter upon seeing me falling!!! You good!!! I'll remember this!!!  That's all... Got to rush off... If not my mum will be nagging again... See you guys tomorrow... Chiao!! Bye!! Good Day!!!  Ps:this reminder is for 4E5 puipls... There will be a D test tomorrow and a Phisics verbal test (what ever it is)...
