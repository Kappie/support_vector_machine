Just like I'ma try to turn working out into an everyday thing. But that's another story entirely.      Anyway, today, even though it was my little brother's birthday(he turned three. Go him XD) mostly sucked. Around....12:00 pm, I got really freaking sick. Headache, right behind my eyes...And everytime I moved them, the pain got worse...Plus nausea, dizziness, and the entire left side of my neck is sore. Along with my back. But, then again, my back has been non-stop sore since March, when I was the Tech Director and threw my back out. Yes, I threw it out. Yes, I'm only 17. Hush.   But, and this is what worries me, it's gotten worse. Not better. And it's gotten worse a whole hell of a lot faster. Since then, the headache has moved to encompass my entire head, and now both shoulders are sore and I can barely stand, much less walk. But what do I care?  Anyway, I'm going to my girlfriend's house tomorrow morning. Hopefully I'll be feeling better by then  --Out
