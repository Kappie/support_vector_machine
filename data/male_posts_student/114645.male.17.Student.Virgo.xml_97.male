Yes, that is big because Rancho's football team hasen't been very good, but we are now 2-0! Oh yea! We beat Cheyenne in overtime, 18-12 at Cheyenne. I went to the game, and I am gonna try and make it to every game. I'm buying a Rancho Football T-shirt on Monday.   and two...Ken told me he loved me! Isn't it great? I feel loved. I am loved. Could like getting any better? hehe. I love Ken. He loves me. hehe. :-P Okay, I'm gonna go before I get all giddy. Nite all!  PS - I'M LOVED! hehehe
