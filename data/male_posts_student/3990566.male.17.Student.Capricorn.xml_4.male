BCA was rather boring.. i was listening to perfect 10 98.7fm in class and i dedicated 2 songs to my good brothers in secondary and primary sch.. it was limp bizkit' s boiler and linkin park's numb.. i made those request online but i din know if it was played anot.. hahaz.. well, maybe i shall try nx tym when i am at mcdonalds doing project or studying.. (coz there's this free wireless internet shit)  then aft the BCA workshop my CATS group went to lookup this spinster lee irene coz the Mr Goh she recmmended to us was on half day leave.. we wanted to find sum1 else to help in our artefact.. but she sucked lah... she claimed tt she was busy wif sum1 doing sumthing(wonder wad thing) then cannot see us.. nvm.. then she tell us see Anson.. Anson was quite helpful lah.. hahaz.. muz thank him..   aft tt we went to canteen 1 to stick the parts into 1 piece. Amanda wanted to do it so we din stop her..and she was foolish enuf (sorry for saying tt u are folish)to squeeze the glue onto the syringe which causes the glue tooverflow andstain her fingers.. poor thing.. then she went to clean it off.. howeva, it cant be cleaned off and she said tt its burning her fingers.. poor thing.. and she nearly cried.. then gary wif the thinner saved the day..   went to meet guo qing at the atrium to wait 4 derek then we go canteen 2 eat.. the chicken chop was jux as good as b4.. always up to the standard.. no wonder its on the newspaper.. went home aft tt and din went to play pool..
