I don't know why its today, but this week I have been reading  Youth Walk Magazine  devotional called the Body. And it's all about using your spiritual gifts. And you know that's exactly what I think God is trying to show me what to do right now.  For so long I have just been terrified to sing in front of anyone, and God is just telling me that I will overcome that fear if I lay it down. And I have to sing in front of the Church this Sunday and that's majorly important to me. Recital was important, but this is a bigger step. I'm going to be ministering to someone. THAT'S A BIG DEAL!! But it's what I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life.  I'm embracing what God has called me to do. And I will eagerly work to be the best that I can be.  Sunday night I will not perform to the crowds, I will worship my amazing God. May I lead others with me.
