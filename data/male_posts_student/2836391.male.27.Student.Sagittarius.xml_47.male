Like the stranger that you've met, the ragged man in ragged clothes The silver thorn of bloody rose, lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow  Now I think I know what you tried to say to me How you suffered for your sanity How you tried to set them free They would not listen they're not listening still    Perhaps they never will.
