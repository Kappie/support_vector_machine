And we trimmed the weekend's worth of auditions down to 5 contenders.  It's going to be a really hard decision.  They sure aren't making it easy on us.  So after my week in San Fran, I'll return to a hellish night of decision-making.   Week in San Fran, night of decision making.  Week in San Fran, night of decision making.  I'll survive.  A couple days of duty and a week's vacation during which I'll see a city I've never seen, an ocean I've never seen, an old prison I've never seen on an island I've never seen...  Yeah, I'll take it.  Free vacation.  Had a really frustrating conversation with a friend tonight.  Brought up a topic that has all of a sudden become very touchy for me.  I'm such a winner.  Gahd.  So the Harmony Sweeps finals are lining up.  I won't say much about the NYC regional except to say there was a huge collective sigh of relief from Groove when neither Duwende nor the Exboyfriends won in NYC.  However, I'm told the group that won just blew everyone away.  Was incredible.  So now we're looking at Chapter 6, who won the ICCA finals last year; 2x2, the new incarnation of the Georgian Six who made a strong showing in Boston last year and won in NYC this year; III of a Kind, a trio from the Phillipines; the Tone Rangers, a group from the DC area about whom I know very little; and Groove.  Woo.  Gon' be a fun time.   I'm off to bed.  Melodia just got home and we got a chance to talk for a bit, which was nice, because I've missed her dearly.  But now I'm really exhausted.  So I'm off.  But I'll leave you with one final thought:  My arrangements are going to be performed at Lincoln Center.  Who wants to touch me?  (can y'tell I'm a little excited?)  lates.
