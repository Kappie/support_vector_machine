They list 10 principles by which members of their congregations can better evaluate a candidate’s stated policy objectives. These Christian principles:  1. War is contrary to the will of God. 2. God calls us to live in communities shaped by peace and cooperation. 3. God created us for each other, and thus our security depends on the well being of our global neighbors. 4. God calls us to be advocates for those who are most vulnerable in our society. 5. Each human being is created in the image of God and is of infinite worth. 6. The earth belongs to God and is intrinsically good. 7. Christians have a biblical mandate to welcome strangers. 8. Those who follow Christ are called to heal the sick. 9. Because of the transforming power of God’s grace, all humans are called to be in right relationship with each other. 10. Providing enriched learning environments for all of God’s children is a moral imperative.  At the end of the list the document adds:  Finally, our religious tradition admonishes us not to bear false witness against our neighbor and to love our enemies. We ask that the campaigns of political candidates and the coverage of the media in this election season be conducted according to principles of fairness, honesty and integrity.

A number of these principles are strikingly similar to some of the Quaker testimonies, particularly the first one: “war is contrary to the will of God”. The document notes that there might be times wherein force is required, but only as a last resort and in rare circumstances (a sort of narrower, stricter interpretation of the Just War principle, I guess). Nonetheless, the fact that a major Christian ecumenical organization would declare such a principle is still remarkable. Part of the work of the “ urlLink Every Church a Peace Church ” is to assist individuals and congregations to learn, meditate on, and move towards a Peace Church stance.    If there’s one point that the historic Peace Churches ( urlLink Church of the Brethren ,  urlLink Mennonite ,  urlLink Friends ) are accurate about is that Christ taught and lived peace. To follow him and his ways is to be one whose actions and attitudes are full of peace. These days this sort of individual would be labeled a “pacifist”. It saddens the heart that the religion named after Jesus is associated with warfare. Pacifism is associated with several other world religions. Many people equate pacifism to  urlLink Buddhism , for example. It is a failure of the church that this can not be said for Christianity.
