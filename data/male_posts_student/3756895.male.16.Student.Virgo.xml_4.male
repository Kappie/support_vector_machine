That Beckham is a bloody dickhead, taking a penalty as though it was a free-kick. Nevertheless, it didn't dampen my mood to play Shattered Galaxy(SG)!! Taking damn bloody long to max stats and get my units to max lvl.  Gotta do homework before my chem teacher, Mdm Koh, starts running up to me saying :"Stay back and do your work!" ;( Lastly, must thank Qifang for guiding me through the process of making this blog. ^^  Thanks alot, Qifang ~
