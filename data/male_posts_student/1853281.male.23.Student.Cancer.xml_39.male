I am really loathing the whole broke-can't-spend-any-money thing. school is going that is all i can really say, got b minuses on two papers, and i am rather peeved at that. have a revised paper due wednesday, so i have to revise it tonight, should not take too long, and than i will need to start clearing out the office, which will be tylers room. otherwise, the weather is nice, and i get to wear my hot leather jacket. I am ten pounds lighter than the last time i weighed myself(like a month ago) nothing else new cheers
