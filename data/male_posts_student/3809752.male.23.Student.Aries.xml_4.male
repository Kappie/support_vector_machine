We found out she had a faulty surge protector which blew her first one :( We remedied this problem by buying an expensive batter backup/surge protector. Since I have forgotten what chapter we had to read over the weekend I will be checking Mr. Harden's blog to see what I need to brush up on tonight and what questions I need to do. Hopefully I'll be able to get my grade up eventually :(
