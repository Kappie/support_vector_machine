I tried explaining to him about straight-edge in German, but quickly slipped into what I generally do in German, which is lying by saying what I know how to say instead of the truth. Ultimately I told him that my edge was something I had sworn myself to as a youth and therefore upheld. His response was to say, literally, "Respect". He has a much, much younger girlfriend with him and is surrounded by a cabal of black-wearing grey-haired German acolytes. Other than them, no-one seems to like him. Last night me and my conference-buddy Drew Chastain rented bikes for 20kr. (the system here is like with shopping trolleys, where you put 20kr in the slot and the bike is released, and then when you bring it back later and plug it back in, the 20 is rereleased) and cycled over to  urlLink Christiania . It was kind of difficult to work out what was going on there in the darkness - there wasn't a lot of street lighting - but it was a bit different to what I'd been led to expect. We basically though it was like  urlLink Tivoli , where we'd been earlier in the evening, minus the entry charge and rollercosters. Cops were patrolling and there were heaps of little capitalist enterprises, like restaurants and bars. The had a big screen TV projection. Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven was showing so I watched that while Drew drank. I was pleasantly surprised by what an awesome movie it was. At the end of the night, after a visit to one of Copenhagen's zillion 7-Elevens, where I palmed a Daim ice-cream, I rode home on my twenty-krona bike and abandoned it outside the hostile hostel, where I found it this morning, gone, unsurprisingly. Ok, as a final musing on this country, I have to observe the incredible unhealthiness of the diet of these people, which undoubtedly goes a way to explaining there porcinity. First, smoking is rife and you can smoke pretty much anywhere compared to Australia. Secondly, beer drinking is of course very popular. Thirdly people drink Coca-cola as if it was water, much as I once did - well, actually, I've been off that wagon since I've been here becuase they've been laying the shit on in glass bottles. Fourthly, the most ubiquitous food is sausages. In the Seven-11s, there's like a massive frying area with five types of sausage, including sausage wrapped in bacon, plus sausage rolls. Hot dog stands are everywhere. Just thinking about it makes my stomach contract painfully. On the other hand, this shit is counteracted by the incredible bicycle culture of this city. Cycle lanes are real lanes, not just a designated area at the side of the road, on all the main roads. 50% of Danes reportedly cycle to and from work. It's awesome. Sadly the 20kr. municipal/tourist bikes are, though of sturdy desing, fucking slow, which diminished my enjoyment somewhat.
