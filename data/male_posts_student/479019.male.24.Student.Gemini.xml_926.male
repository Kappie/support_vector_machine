However, maybe I shouldn't be bitching. So Cal's got a heat wave going on right now. It was hitting 100 and over a few times.  Freedom is mine for the most part. I handed in my 2 papers yesterday and now there's just a few formalities left for me to deal with and then I'm done. It'll be pretty much chilling and packing until I leave next Thursday.  Human rights violations in Iraq and by violations... those prisonners were totally violated (sexually). This is an example of why I have major issues with how people defend the military, not just in this case, but in general. The military as a total institution has no social checks and balances to behavior. Common sense goes out the window, and things like the raping of women in military academies, bases and "accidents" that kill people are not accounted for. I'm not such a hippy in that I do actually believe that as long as there is a interstate system, we need defensive forces. However, I don't like how it is structured as almost a world apart from the rest of society.  Tomorrow is the Bouncing Souls, Randy and Avail!!!  I'm in a pretty good mood right now despite two little somewhat related things. The first is a problem that I knew I'd have to address sooner or later. I don't think it's that big of a deal, but I guess like I've comment on politics... you don't know the implications of decisions when you make them. The second one is sort of the trap I let myself fall back in, that has me feeling apathetic about problem #1. Yea I'm vague... but whatever, I'll be in California in 9 days!!!  ***
