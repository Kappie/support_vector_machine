It turned out to be really stupid. Who would make a show like that? I guess with all the reality tv being so popular in the here and now it makes a little sense. But Amish people living in the city, give me a break.       The fun thing about reading that story was that I got to make fun of a friend. Doesn't sound very nice, but it's pretty funny. Somebody he works with thinks he's Amish for some reason...... pretty interesting. If you're interested in checking out the MSN article here's the link......  http://entertainment.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=164904      On a side note, there's another great article I had the chance to read from MSN. It's called "How to Jazz Up a Tiny Room". I thought it was an interesting article if you look at it from a creative standpoint. Check it out......  http://houseandhome.msn.com/Decorate/5ColorSchemesforSmallSpaces.aspx  Adios.
