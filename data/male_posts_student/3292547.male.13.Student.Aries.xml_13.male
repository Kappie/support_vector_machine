No more teachers (except for my mom =P)No more lockers. Nothing until this Fall. I still have to get my report card tomorrow,but that doesn't matter.  That's all I have to write right now. See ya later. Oh wait, I'm working on uploadinga few MSN smilies to a server so that I'll have some color in these post.
