My favorite anime changes rapidly, but anime I enjoy usually air on Adult Swim and the International Channel. A great deal of my friends also enjoy anime, but not as much as I do. I usually judge a new anime by the artwork, then the story line because I know if the artwork sucks, then even if I like the story, I will get sick of it. My Bass skills shock my family and friends mostly because I spend at least 4 hours a day practicing. Blink 182 is my favorite band, but I also like Linkin Park, Sum 41, Simple Plan, Hoobastank, and some J-pop like The Pillows, Every Little Thing, and others. I spend more time on my Xanga site at  urlLink www.Xanga.com/xXOrangeJuicyXx  but I thought It would be fun to have a blogger thingy too. My favorite song to listen to and to play is Adam's Song and I am currently seeking out a band to play to drum, guitar, and keyboard part. As of yestarday I was working on a song called "Hinata." I got the bass down, but I'm still working on the lyrics. O well... I guess I'll see you around.
