They apparently falsely accused a homeless man of attacking them in a park to cover up why they were late coming home from school. The guy served eight months in prison before the girls confessed that they had made it all up. If i knew more about the case, I would tell you, but I don't because the story was interrupted by a press conference about John Ashcroft's gallstones. I mean, come on people, I know he's a big part of the American government and all, but do we really need a 5 minute segment about him going to the hospital for gallstones? I don't think the story even warrants one of those little headlines at the bottom of the screen.  The things that pass as news these days.
