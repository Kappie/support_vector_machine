But hey. Anyway, I will now proceed to tell you the basic outline of the greatest story never told. Don't mind if it contradicts itself or just sounds rubbish, this is basically only a plot outline. If you feel that you can write this book, please feel free. Just remember to send me a percentage of the royalties.  Story starts, we have one bloke who's captured by angels after doing a good deed, one bloke kidnapped by devils after doing a bad deed. Both are given godlike powers and are told that they are the weapons in a war between heaven and hell, which will be staged on Earth. Winner takes all, losers are wiped off the face of the universe.  Devils and Angels then begin slaying living people left and right, and the people become spirit warriors for the side that killed them. This is because spirit warriors are quite difficult to hit compared to soft fleshy humans.  Stuff happens, and then we get to the anticlimax of the book. The armies of heaven and hell race against each other, all set for a stunningly cool battle. Two godlike blokes begin having a matrix-style kung fu war with lots of magic effects thrown in as well*. However they soon discover that neither of them can win as they are both equally matched. They begin talking and discover** that the angels/devils that recruited them were actually not angels/devils at all, just vastly powerful beings playing a kind of chess with the human world as we know it. They then gather the armies of Earth (as well as all the spirit warriors) and march against the beings fiddling with human affairs. In one cool final battle they destroy those that created them and then they both die, due to them not being needed any more.  I then proceed to rake in money from hardback editions of the book, film rights, and merchandise (specifically spirit warrior cuddly toys).     *Alright, so maybe I also planned a film version as well. Is that so wrong?  ** Via some cool plot elements  I failed to mention.
