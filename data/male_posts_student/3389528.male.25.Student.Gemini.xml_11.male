I'm supposed to greet some Lutheran pastor from the area who is falling in love with the Church.  I hope I do it justice.  My dad is good at that thing.  The least I can do is make him feel comfortable.   In a matter of weeks I will be expected to get up at 630 again every morning and go go go go til 1130/midnight all the way until August.  sheesh.  I dont know if I'm up for it again.  2 years is a long time to get lazy.   I know what you're thinkin.  Haven't I been doing that here at school?  Yes and no.  Nuff said.  I'm lazy.  There's nothing else to it.  Surprised?  Didn't think so.    I love seeing rays of sunlight revealed via incense in the chapel.  Just thought I'd share that random thought.  Guess I was paying attention to something else after all. peace
