Two units almost complete (just needs some group work parts), almost done my english essay outline, and will complete history essay notetaking. I might go and do some computer science, or religion later too. Manage to play half an hour of b-ball and half an hour of piano too =P    At times like this, you sometimes wonder: "What if I worked harder at the beginning? I was so stupid! *slaps head* Why did I waste so much time?" Luckily, those kinda thoughts don't come often, and I try to get them out of my head asap, before I waste more time wallowing in self-pity. ^^;; The only thing to do, really, is just look forward and do the damn work already.    Looks like I could probably make it... I have around 65 units left, not counting exams and "free" units. That's down from 75 units last week... I think it's cause I forgot to count some "free" units, but whatever. All I know is that summer school and carryover are not options... my dad was pretty clear that he did not think much of those. And taking that into account, he would probably kill me if i  did  take those options. yay.   S'all for now, ja!   ~Chronos
