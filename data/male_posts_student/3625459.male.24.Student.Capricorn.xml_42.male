I had 2 dreams about her this morning, about me meeting her ( why me ?) .. sometimes things dont work the way you owntthem to .I guess i must lean to accept the consequences. I mean she's happy.. thats what really matters, not how i feel. Aint easy trying to be there for some one as a friend whom you like them a whole lot more.   Why did you ask me to be there for the wedding C. You know that i wont. Dont think i;d be able to hold myself if i were there.   Still have so many plans for, i wonder if they'd ever take off. I mean somethings are worth it, i do have a reason to live.. maybe i'd never tell you about it . as much as i want to, im not real to you. I can tell you stuff, but i cant make you feel.   Wonder if we'd never walk along the wall of berlin, wonder if we'd go to all those pretty places I dont want to go alone, In a way i nevr alone cos i carry you with me, a memory  A man without hope. that will never be me, i'll always have hope ... its got me this far. I may have never accomplished a lot in life.. ive been there for ppl , ive been there when some one needed me ... i not destined for greatness or anything ,. im that silly sidekick , who'd always be there.
