I know the possibility that Daniel or Greg is gonna read this and hate me for admitting this, but i have to. And besides, they already sorta knew.  The deal is this: I am only just coming up to 17, with my exams occupying most of my time between now and the summer, and then im spending practically the whole summer working with Scottish Youth Theatre. Plus i'll be writing on here all the time, so i really have little spare time between now and September. I have no time for proper relationships, and it would be unfair to get into one - like buying a dog and leaving it at home all day while u go to work.  That doesnt mean im about to do without sexual activity though. And would you deny me it?   Recently i've been "seeing" 5 guys. They all know about each other, we're all very inexclusive, and i havent been sleeping with any of them or fucking them around. So anyone who wants to call me a slut can find a decent arguement first...    ~ Greg i like. Lovely. Black as well, so its very much a turn-on. I've known him longer than the other four, but if i ever had anything with him it would be purely sexual. I couldn't get emotionally involved with him...too clingy.   ~ Ross. Used to talk to him a lot, and he doesnt currently have a boyfriend. But hes been looking for a bit on the side. Not sure i could do that to his boyfriend. Or myself.   ~ Jamie i feel bad about. He's 18. Percussionist from RSAMD that i met at one of his concerts. What we have is only sexual. Bearing in mind i havent slept with any of them. So as far as it's gotten so far was a meeting last Tuesday for an outdoor-oral-sex experience. It makes me feel dirty just thinking about it. And i think i like that feeling.   ~ Ryan is now over. Half an hour ago he was dramatic, condescending and patronising to me for the last time. I'm hardly one to talk, but he's a collosal geek who overreacts with everything and thinks the way to a guys heart is to inform him that he "gave a bj in a public toilet today". Ick.   ~ And last, but by absolutely no means least we have Daniel. Who i love. I'm not in love with him, but theres so much about him i love. He's such an utter dork it is massively cute. His eyes are gorgeous and just scream sincerity, and his smile makes me melt. He's coming over on tuesday for a nice day of sitting about doing "nothing". I seriously can't wait, not just because i'll be getting some ;) but because i'll be near him.   And i just realised - what the hell is my dillemma again?! Why the hell not Daniel? DUH! The problem i have is that while im getting emotionally invested in this, so is he, and so i have to keep reminding him as well as myself that i cant get into anything exclusive just now.     DAMMIT!
