Apparently the analysis was requested by Democrats who oppose the Bush tax cuts, which brings up an interesting quesiton: what parameters and numbers were used to calculate the "tax burden"? Never forget, not for one second, that when you're dealing with numbers it is all about what you look at and how you report it - numbers (especially when you're dealing with extremely large numbers) very seldom are a complete reflection of reality. We're trained to think otherwise because simple mathematics do, in fact, reflect reality (2 + 2 = 4; always has, always will). However, when you're dealing with numbers so large that your mind can barely wrap around it (can you possibly concieve of how much money even $1 billion is? - with the government most revenue runs into the  trillions ).   So, in the article, one side (the budget report requested by the Democrats) says the middle class tax burden has increased. In other statements made by Republicans looking at different numbers  in the same report  say that isn't the case. WTF?  So, who to believe? You and I may never know. We aren't told precicely how the calculations were made, and we aren't told all of the parameters around the calculations or what numbers the calculations were based on to begin with. Without that information this article is just so much partisan hot air.   One of the more laughable quotes is in the middle of the article where they compare the amount of money the tax cut generated for each comparative income level. The bottom 20% recieved $250, the middle 20% got $1,090, and the top 1% got back $78,460. They tell us the top 1% averages $1.1 million income per year, and the middle 20% earns about $63,000 (I'm extrapolating from their statement that the middle 20% earns between $51k and $75k pre year). So if I have my math correct that means the middle 20% recieved roughly 2% of my annual income back as a tax cut divident. The top 1% is getting back roughly 7% on average. Not a very bad deal considering that the upper tax brackets pay a far larger percentage of their annual income in taxes than I do.   Another thing to consider is that there is a much more broad range in revenue for the top 1% than for the middle 20%. The difference in the mid 20% is between $50 - 70k, (a 40% swing) the upper 1% we are told averages $1.1 million, well what is the actual range? $1 million to several billion (we have quite a few billionairs in America)? If that is the case we are talking a swing of over 90,000% - that's a HUGE margin of difference for the top 1%. So those numbers quoted in the article are averages, which doesn't really do well in reflecting reality (remember in high school how you hated the dude that wreced the grading curve by doing really well on a test? - the same principle applies here: the curve (average) isn't terribly reflective of the true nature of the upper 1%).   Anyway - all I'm really saying is that these numbers are kind of silly to be tossing around. Especially the "top 1%" numbers. Those are just plain stupid. There are all kinds of special tax/income rules that apply to the top 1% anyway so all these tax numbers being tossed around are probably more meaningless than we can possibly realize.  I'm just odd enough to look at it differently to begin with - I have no problem with tax burden being more equitable to begin with. Here's what actually happened: my "tax burden" went up and the wealthy "tax burden" went down, but that's because taxes were lowered across the board. We are all paying less in taxes. As long as I'm not paying  more  in taxes (which I already feel is too much) then I don't particularly care how large or small my "tax burden" is. It could be completely equal across the board (flat rate tax anyone?) - and I wouldn't care.
