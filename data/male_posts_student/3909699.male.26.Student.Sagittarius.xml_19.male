To set the scene, after living in the UK pretty much my whole life, except for really quite brief stints in France and Germany, I relocated to Australia two-and-a-quarter years ago and now I'm going back to the Northern hemisphere for the first time since then - in fact, it's the first time I've been North of Brisbane or out of the Easternmost three states of Australia in the entire time. So, tomorrow, first stop Saigon, second stop Paris (technically the day after tomorrow), third stop Manchester, and fourth stop Lancaster, where I have never been before.
