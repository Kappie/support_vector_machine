The week so far: crap, except for when one of the gorillas at the zoo tried to bust out and kill Kevin Rosenberg...that was funny.  This week has been pretty much junk so far. Although, I did check out two excellent, and I mean that wholeheartedly, books, both by an author that should be more widely recognized-much more. You get 3 guesses: 1. Tom Clancy? no 2. Michael Moore? no...lol 3. Al Franken? he should be, but no  Give up? Well here's a clue: He's from British, er, in other words, he's British.  Ok fine, I'll tell you: Neil Gaiman is the guy, and Stardust and American Gods (highly recommended!!) are the novels. But I do warned you, these books aren't for everyone. They are generally exclusively for people who actually  want  to read, and not just books required for English class. Also, you need an adult mind, as it is the definition of an "adult book". Everyone's assignment: find out more about this author, and write an 8-page report on him. j/k  As for this weekend, I'll be cross-country skiing and downhill skiing up north at Duluth and Lutsen, respectively. Should be hellafun, so as long as I don't break anything performing a 360 helicopter.  Well, I must be going, as the old man needs the internet.  Again, I thank everyone who has given me the ideas and such for this blog. I especially thank Amelia for recommending that wonderful book-it's a must read for all book junkies out there.
