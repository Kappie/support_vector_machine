It was like a Main Street Fair but in Sewaren by the water.  The food was too expensive so I just got a $4 smoothie instead.  NJ 101.5 was there and I got a cup and a catwoman poster (purr).  My sister played piano for a crowd at the park and got sunburn (pwned).  I left after she was done playing and I tried out the "course" at WHS.  After that I came home and stuff.  Tomorrow were get to start finals! Yay!
