I didn't really mean that...but this week has been extrememly stressful and its just so damn annoyin' that school had takin' up like fuckin' a lot of my time.  And plus,  Eddie  told me that neither  Nick  nor  I  have been updatin' the blog.  Its nice to know that have some readers and that some of them actually look forward to hearin' what we havta say!  Anyway, I think I'll blog about this week...sigh.  OK, lets re-experience the horrow, shall we?   Monday  had not really turned out so bad.  It was  Memorial Day , and we had a nice little barbeque.  Yeah, my  Lolo  (thats what I used to call my  grandfather ) was a war veteran, but I'm pretty sure we weren't commemoratin' that.  Of course, we didn't mean anythin' disrespectful by doin' that.  We just saw it as an opportunity to have a fuckin' party.  It was really great, with barbeque (tons of it too!), swimmin', karaoke, and just relaxin' with friends and family.   Josh  and  Naoki  came over, and we hung out and did stuff.  There was a really kick ass karaoke machine too.  Everyone loved that damn thing!  Anyway, it was really fun and stuff and so I couldn't help but think,"Wow, it feels so much like summer right now!"  As we all know though, summer wasn't exactly here, as in summer vacation.  Thats when  Tuesday  reared its ugly fuckin' head and I had to drag myself to school and withstand more slave labor.  I was gettin' pretty stressed cuz I hadn't really done much of the work required for the  World Cultures Country Project !  As much as I really think that class is kick ass, I really hated doin' the work.  I had to make a video, find some articles, make a poster, and do some required (but strangely unnecessary) work, and get some ingredients to make a Japanese dish.  Wow, I was practically losin' my fuckin' hair dude!  Anyway, in the rest of my classes, work was still comin' and comin', but most important was (is) the  Author Project !  Also, a group project for  Spanish 2  was sprung on us.  Fuckin' school huh?  Anyway, I went to my sister  Sheelah's  boyfriend's house.  His name is  Mark  by the way.  I had to seperate those two sentences so that there wouldn't be any confusion.  Anyway, there I downloaded some songs for the video portion of the  World Cultures Country Project .  It was fun, but I got a little carried away with downloadin' music.   Kazaa  is pretty addictive sometimes, but yeah.    Wednesday  came.  It was a  minimum day , so that was when I decided to invite  Nick, Eddie, Josh, and Naoki  over to sorta force them (yeah in typical  Fascist  style), to help me with recordin' and makin' the video.  It was really fun, and they started comin' up with pretty cool ideas and stuff.  There was tons of choreography, cheap shots, screw-ups (mostly made by me), and a lot more.  Too bad there wasn't much fact, which was what the fuckin' video was sposta have.  Oh well, had a lot of fun doin' it...yeah...all (however many number of hours) it took to make it.  I later went to the  Asian Market  (yeah  Eddie  its seriously called the  Asian Market ) with  Sheelah  and purchased some  tempura  batter, tempura dipping sauce, and  Aji Nori Furikake  (its some seasonin' stuff that has seaweed and seasame seeds in it...great stuff), and some other stuff.    Its seriously early  Thursday .  I've been workin' fuckin' tirelessy all fuckin' night god dammit!  I don't even wanna think about it much.  It seriously pisses me off!  That mornin', I got my shit all together and made the tempura and stuff.  Yay!  I get to present!  Didn't go too bad, and I was satisfied.  Sounded like the class and  Briski  were too.  Video induced laughin', food induced compliments, chopsticks induced confusion.  The rest of the day...I kept fallin' asleep!  Crap!   Eddie  absent, so I went to his house and tried to help him out with the shit he missed.  I hope I helped.  And now we come to today.   Friday .  You'd think that it would be time for rest and relaxation.  Nah, you got that wrong.  Even if I got that fuckin'  Country Project  done, I still have the  Author's Project  thing to do!  Great, huh?  Well yeah, today  Nick, Eddie, Naoki, Ashvir, and I  attended the  CSF Awards Banquet .   Nick and Naoki  got 2 service awards and  Ashvir and I  were able to scrape up an award too.  There was free food, which I thought was even better than gettin' an award.  I gotta get a new I.D. too.  Sucks, cuz there isn't a lot of days left till the end of the slave/school-year.  Its kinda a waste of a good ten bucks...but I want the damn yearbook.  Also,  The Inkblot  (school's magazine) got its published and printed magazine,  The Inkblot .  Niiiice.  Yeah, thats 'bout it for now.   My 'rents  are singin' on that damn  karaoke machine .  Its fuckin' funny to watch 'em sing and stuff.  There kinda cool.  Maybe I should start  Filipino Idol  and they can try out and get rejected.  Heheh...anyway, I know that it was sorta weird to blog about my life, especially since this is a dual blog, but I didn't really have anythin' to talk about.  Anyway, most of you were involved some way, somehow, so its pretty much about yer life too assholes.  Anyway, this thing is kinda like a journal or somethin'.  If you don't like the personal life in there, don't read it, cuz personal life makes up a portion of what we blog about.  Shit!  Alright, thats enough for now...gotta check up on the  P.R.E.
