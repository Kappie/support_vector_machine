For if life was good all the time, then we wouldn’t appreciate the times that it was actually good. I hope that made sense.  In any case things are looking good now. I finally got a stable and fully functional  > after 3 long months. I have some new software and games that I can enjoy and get lost in, no more deadlines, no more tesst. Ahh Life  is  good.  Of course it not all fun and games. Can’t totally slack. I’m behind on my reading for my current module and I still have to review my last two modules often so as to prepare myself for the exams next month. I’ve also picked up some learning material for Windows XP Professional. If I’m going to be working in the IT industry like I hope, it would be a good idea to know as much as I can about the most used operating systems. Normally I would like to learn with self-taught hands on experience. But I’m kinda tired of just messing around with stuff on my own. Things are getting more and more complex nowadays that it’s good to have some sort of guide otherwise untold damage can be done. That being said, one can learn a lot from taking things apart with one’s hands and trial and error. Oh to go back to simpler times.    >  Some other things that I would require to focus on include helping some people source for PDA’s. Can’t keep them waiting for too long. And I still have yet to get around to that article about PDA’s that I was planning to do up here. But you know what they say, no demand, no production.  My church is acquiring some new computers and planning to link some of them up in a network for the study room. I offered to help and give advice on the setting up. Time to put that new book I bought to good use.  And in the mist of all this I have to find time to start on driving lessons. Still don’t know why I’m resisting this fact of life. Guess the information on how much the COE and car prices are keeping me getting excited about it.    > Such a great joy today to get into one of my all time favorite computer games that was once thought long gone.  urlLink Ur-Quan Masters  is the remake of Star Control 2 and features all the same gameplay, deep and rich story, fast-paced yet tactical action and huge doses of humor. Many new features have been added such as remix soundtrack and speech, makes this a must for fans, short of a true sequel, since Star Control 3 was made by different people and thus doesn’t count. Looks like sleepless nights are here again. *grins*  I shall close with this regularly uttered quote from the game:  "Yeah! tonguing! The tonguing is the best!" - The Zot-Fot-Piq talking about their  Sting er ships
