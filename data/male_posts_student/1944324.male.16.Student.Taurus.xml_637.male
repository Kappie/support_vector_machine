I told you that, right?  I got my braces off?  I don't remember if I announced that to you or if that was after I "quit".  Who knows, eh?  Ooo!  I'm going to start saying "no?" at the end of sentences.  Sounds good, no?  See?  Doesn't that sound so foreign?!  Okay, sorry, I'm a bit hyper and have a lack of places to express my hyperosity.  Plus I'm putting off reading The Scarlet Letter.  I hate that book.  GRRRRR.  :D   There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!
