Normally I give passing celebrities hardly a passing glance; their impacts upon my life are usually relatively miniscule, and the impact of their passing will be even less so.  But I found myself really feeling sorry for President Reagan's death; perhaps its somewhat my own childhood sentiment, but in many ways Reagan stood for the good things in America.  During his presidency America was relatively united both internally and, as such, presented a united front in a period of extreme political tension and potential horrific disaster.  And I think a lot of it was just the way that he brough people together through his positive attitude; few politicians emanate the genuine aura of goodwill and optimism that he did, and for that reason the world is less for his passing.
