KICK ASS... how cool is that ... really i love it... but then i think i did pretty decent on my physics quiz... which was a shocker to me ... because i have been kind of struggling... i dont feel like ive learned anything except for maybe 4 equations.. but i like the class... so anyways .. the rest of the day was good too.. i got out all my NHS app. stuff except for extracurriculars, but ill do that tomorrow and i dont have much homework tonight... times are most definitely good in hudson today... and with that i am done
