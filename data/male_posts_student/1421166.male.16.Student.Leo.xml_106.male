Have been thinking about the same thing and people for the past few days until now. It's like I just can't get it out of my mind. Oh well.  Anyway, have to introduce a new member of my life story. Esther is a sweet Chrisitian girl that I got to know recently. She's kinda like into love poems and novels. Kinda like me a while ago. Yup. (Do not worry my brothers and sisters, I don't need sermons from everyone of you guys after this...hehe...there people who need them more them me! Oops! Almost spilled the beans.)  Today is Yongquan's sister's(imagine if I take out "sister's") wedding day. So kinda was at his house earlier this morning. Cool, got some updates from him, and new secrets. Yeah! Don't worry Yongquan, I will not tell the world that XXXXXXXXX! Haha...no way I'm gonna say it. Continue hoping that I'll actually do so. hehe.  Ok...I'm camp group leader for this year's Youth Retreat. This is so discouraging cause I have such busy people in my camp group. Press on! Empower me!!! But hope to get to know some people better like Jiahui *waves* (though I don't think she visits my blog. Like anyone actually do.) , Gareth (Glen's brother) and Paul (Louis's friend). This is exciting. But with the knowledge that I have less than two weeks to complete ALL my holiday assignments at the back of my head. I guess it'll be quite torturous when it comes to mind.  VS and PLMGSS clarinetist are up to no good. Sorry Cheong Hing and Eudora! It's not my fault! But it's gonna be fun!!! *cheeky thoughts in my head* It's great that no school people have my blog. If not I won't be able to be so transparent about this. If it were so, I probably would get it from my "dearest" section leader.(it's sarcastic, but he's my friend still)  Ok...should go and do something about my homework.
