That's what any intelligent voter would do, right?  One thing that is always fun at convention time is the 'ol campaign tunes.  Kerry's aren't too exciting, but then again who can possibly top Clinton's Fleetwood Mac.  But this got me thinking about why my tune would be.  I don't think Maynard screaming for the end of the world would be a good choice.  Well I am actually typing this from a hotel room in St. Paul.  It's about, or as the locals say "aboot," time for me to head out.  So enjoy your weekend friends!  73's de KC0SVT
