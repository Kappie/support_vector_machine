There are other out there. You know who you are. Well, actually you don't. Ya stupid prick. But you'll find out sooner or later.   I finally found meself a new dream. Fuck love. Fuck hapiness. I'm going to be a billionaire. But, unlike those other dickheads, I will actualy DO SOMETHING with my money. Yes, of course I would live quite comfortably, but not like others.  For starters, I won't have a fucking twenty three bedroom palace for just myself. I won't have gold plated toilets. I won't pay some guy to drive me everywhere. I won't spend $300k on the latest Versace merchandise. Yes, I would buy lotsa stuff, I mean, who wouldn't. But I wouldn't live in excess, when others just can't live at all.  If I were a billionaire, I certainly wouldn't be able to spend all of that money in a lifetime, so I would donate loads and loads of cash to different organizations across the globe to help make the earth into something it should be. Fuck the Canadian Cancer association. I'd donate to Unicef, Greenpeace, things like that. Millions and millions of dollars to help those who need it. Not those who enjoy the luxury of it. Hell, maybe I'd even start an organization or two of my own. What's a good charity that hasn't been started yet. I know! The anti-crazy-dictator-motherfucker organization. TACDMO...Hmmm...Not quite the ring I had hoped. But it would helped. A big problem with this world is crazy dictators trying to police and bully the world. Well, one Texas-borne individual, in particular.  Or perhaps an organization promoting humility and an end to extreme avarice.   Let's talk about an ideal society. In many minds, and ideal society is one without guns, one without wars and fighting. Such a thing is impossible, as it is human nature. A prohibitively difficult thing to change.  Another ideal situation would be one without such greed. Lacking greed, there would be an end to poverty, the rich and the poor would rejoice. Alas, it is human nature to be greedy. Lay a billion dollars in front of any person and leave the room. Surely enough, the billion dollars will be gone when you return.  Rather than treat the cause, why not treat the symptoms. There is no cure for the common cold, the best thing you can go is take some nasal spray and hope for the best. Take away the money. Money is the problem. Greed is not the problem. It is money. Abolish money. Take away money, and people no longer have to kill each other for it. Take away money, and people no longer have to poison the earth to get it.  In my ideal society, money does not exist. You go to work every day just like normal, except every other week, you do not get a paycheck. When you need a loaf of bread, you walk into the store and get one. When you need to see the doctor, you go in and he gives you some medicine. When the doctor needs a loaf of bread, he just walks into the store and takes one. When the store manager needs a new car, he walks down to the dealership and pics out a car. Now that money does not exist, prestige does not exist, and, thusly, fuel inefficient sports cars do not exist. He picks out a nice fuel efficient honda civic. When the farmer who grew the wheat that feeds everybody needs something, he just goes and gets it. Everyone in society does their job, and everyone gets rewarded for it in that they have everything they need. As long as everyone fills their role, perfect harmony will indeed exist. Lumber mills will no longer have to cut down countless trees just to turn a profit. They take only what they need. Without having to worry so much about ourselves, we would become less selfless, and nations would branch out and help the less fortunate, giving all that they can. Currently, there is more than enough food and resources in the world to sustain everybody. The only thing maintaining world hunger is the greed and excess of western nations. Take away the excessiveness and you have enough to go around. If we stopped hogging all the resources, everybody could have their fair share.  But what can we do to achieve this? It will take a long time. Society does not just convert instantly. It will take time. Time and unification.   Does anybody think I'm bordering a little bit on the dictator side of things?
