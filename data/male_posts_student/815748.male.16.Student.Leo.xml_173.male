I don't know how I'm going to do, though.  I misspoke today in history.  We were talking about the Middle East briefly:    Ms. Heidlage : And they have theocracies.  Noah Jampol : What's that?  Me : Rule by the government.   This is an awfully empty-looking post, so I'll put the essay that I wrote yesterday for English about the progression that took place in my writing over the year:   How My Writing Became Sophomoric    	Every year, often imperceptibly, the style with which I approach education changes.  It is not my expansion of knowledge that proves to be the most significant growth; it is the small shifts in my behavior toward my schoolwork.  Writing has demonstrated this the most bluntly.  In the beginning of this sophomore year, I had a prosy, self-important air in my essays.  As the year went on, as most students, I grew tired, and began doing each assignment with a set formula.  By the end, I had realized the need to express myself in my writing, and that, along with the flaws I learned to correct, made me respect my work.  Throughout this year, I took great steps in transforming my English ability, helping me to understand how to use my own voice, engagingly and effectively.  	 When I entered room 348 in September, I thought I had it all figured out.  I had learned “the formula” in middle school, and I used that to churn out virtually every essay I wrote.  All I had to know, I thought, was introduction, body, conclusion, with topic sentences, closing sentences, supporting evidence, and a thesis thrown in there somewhere.  My natural inclination to prevent each paper from being The Most Boring Essay In The World, then, was to use flowery language at critical points.  For example, I used classical allusions and metaphors every so often, as this line from my first essay of the year (the “I am proud of being…, but it’s not without its problems” assignment): “The students and educators of the past two years have argued that to take five honors classes is to steer toward Kharybdis.”  Understandably, above the last word I found the following written on my paper when I got it back: “??!”  This arrogant style made for some decent grades, but some writing of which I am not proud.  	Around the middle of the year, I noticed that I had become stuck in a creative rut.  After months of conditioning, I found that all I would do was the formula.  There was no creativity, no personality, no insight, and no fun in my writing.  Papers such as Black Boy responses made this especially evident.  I hate analyzing literature; I always have, I do, and I believe that I always will.  I believe that books and poetry are meant to be read and enjoyed (though I rarely find poetry enjoyable), not dissected.  Bob Dylan is often credited as refusing to “reveal” the meaning of his songs, for he thought that they meant whatever the listener thought they meant.  It’s just music.  It’s just art.  It’s just entertainment.  As a result, I was completely disinterested in the kind of writing done in English class, and I fell back on the kind of formulaic way that I could use while barely thinking about it.  Added to my apathy was the subject matter: racism.  Truthfully, I do not particularly care about racism.  Perhaps it is because it has been hammered into me by English and other politically correct classes for so long.  Perhaps it was the fact that almost every chapter of Black Boy had the same message, and let’s face it, that’s annoying.  Because of these factors, I turned off.  I had no reason to read the comments that were written on my papers, because I had no reason to improve.  I did not write because I wanted to write, as I am doing now.  I wrote because it was assigned, and it had to get done.  	About three months ago, I had a revelation that changed my writing forever.  It came in the form of a short story about looking at another’s hands.  I chose my friend’s, because I had some moderately funny things to say at them; at least, they would be funny between us.  For example, I made light of how his hands were anorexic, yellow, and feminine.  I fulfilled the requirements of the assignment, and had fun doing it.  I wrote all of the interesting thoughts I had while I was thinking about his hands, actually made a decent point about society, and infused a lot of my own language, my own voice, into it.  The last few sentences of my paper exemplify these things well:  	“Alex,” he questions apathetically, “I forget.  Who was Mustafa Kemal again?” 	I say to myself, back to the drudgery of school, back to this place that produced the very same cycle in which Loren is trapped and in which I may be doomed to fall. 	But dammit, who the crap was Mustafa Kemal?  I think that I got a B on that assignment.  I can’t find it.  Even so, I prefer having received a B on a paper I liked and that my peers liked (I put it on my blog) than a technically sound but boring paper. I enjoyed doing that so much that later on, on the plane back from the mock trials national championship in Orlando, I wrote another short story entirely for fun, and posted it on my blog.  Here, I expressed myself even more honestly, and again, my friends liked it.  When I enjoy my work and it is entertaining to others, I feel that I have done my job.  	I went through a great number of assignments in English this year before arriving at my grand conclusion about English in the recent past: that being entertaining is nine-tenths of being a good writer.  I moved from formula and pretension to burning out and being left with formula, and finally realizing that I could indeed have fun while doing homework.  I accept that my grades on these papers are not the highest they could be, and that my new style (which in fact transferred almost directly from the style I use on my blog) and its colloquialisms and jokes are sometimes lost on my baby-boomer teachers.  Maybe my writing would not impress Charles Dickens, but frankly, his does not impress me.  When my generation inherits the world, its writers not be composing to entertain nineteenth-century English newspaper fiction writers.  Its writers will be composing to entertain their peers.  After I had posted my “hands” short story on my blog, one of my friends told me that she was laughing the whole time she was reading it.  That is the only grade I need.
