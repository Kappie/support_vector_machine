That is untill me and caroline got in on the fun, then it was OK. But first to piss off caroline because it is just wasted space, and to piss off luke because well.. it's a semi naked male here is a   hot cowboy      Here's the song  urlLink  Better Than Jess   The title was caroline's idea after she saw the last song i had made was "jesstastic" which can be found below as song #2 i believe
