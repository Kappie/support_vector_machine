I mean, the origin of the genre was a deviation from the era's popular sound, a frustration with conformity in the music scene. When "punk"  is  the popular sound, it obviously isn't really punk anymore. The spirit is sort of lost.   Also, I would never want to be associated with the "punk" clique at my school. They are just as bad as any other clique. I never hear anything from them but a bunch of gossip about their other hardcore individuals who happen to all dress exactly the same. Every REAL punk rocker has a Xanga Online Diary ©! If you want to be REAL PUNK, go buy some CHUCK TAYLOR ALL STARS ©. Fucking whores. And do you ever notice that a REAL HARDXCORE PUNK ROCKER knows the words to any song by Britney Spears, 50 Cent, or N Sync?  I don't know, just fuck it. I'll listen to whatever bands I like. I feel pretty stupid for putting so much emphasis on labeling bands in the past. I'll take my MUSIC and you can keep your hypocrisy, your fashion, your hollow political revolutions, and your bullshit scene.
