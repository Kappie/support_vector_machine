Get kicked in the groin, at least you can join the Boys Choir, etc etc =)  Anyway, something which I'm trying to persevere and cultivate in my head is that it's the quantity of ideas, not the quality, that is important. It is better to have lots of strange ideas, all different in their own right, than one or two extremely defined and carved idea, as you can always continue concentrating and improving a thought, but you can't get the same inspiration you had at that very moment back, and that may just be the difference between a smoking crater in the ground or your science experiment (made that up on the spot, a little OT, but just deal =P)  I do also note I have been negligent in my blogging performance, therefore I apologise to the ghosts or umbrae reading my blog, since no humans seem to be =P   School  Got a Distinction in Computing, whoop diddy. The main thing I remember about getting it was putting my mind in a blender to try and find a way of getting out of the middle of an isle without annoying anyone else. Luckily, I was adjacent to a walking corridor (well, not really a corridor, just a gap in all the chairs to walk through), so I pulled my seat out into the corridor and walked along it, therefore not annoying anyone else and having to leap over others feet =P Even one of the girls noticed my 'heroic' attempts and criticised someone else in our row for not doing the brave and daring maneuver.  Had parent teacher, overall, very happy with it. Main criticism was 'Stephen can't rely on his natural ability anymore...' Darn, they're forcing me to study now =P lol Was very pleased with my English teacher though, she told me that the story I wrote in the exam (had like 40 minutes), the nightmare one I talked about earlier, really revealed a 'light and fluffy' side to me (she didn't say light and fluffy, just thought it was the perfect description lol)  Everyone was expecting a futuristic, techno, over the top, serious, etcetera, story from me, and instead they got a romantic comedy, and NO, I didn't plan to write a romantic comedy, it just... Happened... Pretty good while starting from the word 'Nightmare', huh? =P   Shrek 2  Saw Shrek 2 on the weekend, was crammed into a tiny spot at the back of the room as we were late lol I had a very kind girl next to me (I also had to help give her back her handbag, it was accidently kicked to the left as my mum walked through the isle) and her annoying (what I thought) boyfriend, who kept complaining about the smallest things, like a child crying a bit, and babbling about the Box Office returns of the movie.  About the movie though, I liked the story overall, but they may have to create a new story soon as they're beginning to massacre it. Graphics, as per usual, were excellent, especially with the implementation of global illumination in all rendering and that of fast subsurface scattering, made some of the characters at least the quality of Final Fantasy imho. Of the main two things I remember is a mushroom splashed in a potion, which, from one corner of it, becomes cocooned in an aura, and then puffs into smoke and becomes a rose. I also loved how Shrek was played out as a human.  AND ABOUT MOVIES IN GENERAL A few of the biggest movie names, I'm using Scary Movie and Shrek  Sh-2 as examples, are making huge amounts off of a mock plot. While Shrek may have a bit of a deeper plot, a lot of it is made enjoyable by the mocking of other stories, such as the Lord of the Rings and other legends or myths in Shrek 2, or the use of scary movies and completely mock playing them such as in Scary Movie. These have all made giant gains at the box office, and are not to be underestimated.   Creativity  Thinking about creativity also, I think I prefer making full worlds as the larger the world, the more things I need to make to exist within it, and therefore the more ideas I am able to generate. Small disconnected ideas are fine, but this makes the idea seem to have a depth around it, as if it does come from somewhere, by the ways it links to other things. Stuart has really fallen in love with my story about a flying world (project name is Aerial Spires, and a beginning story of it is below) The whole world is beginning to be based upon Hallows Peak, and it has become partially destroyed during a war. Stuart and I may be planning to make a story based around it, but how far it will get (whether it gets anywhere at all lol) is questionable =P  'The only power I believe in comes out of the barrel of a gun' A quote from the movie 'The Phantom' (on in background) Well, that's an interesting statement. A society based around settling all of their affairs through singular gunfights, almost in a Western style, but I've never been a fan of Westerns =P Singular gunfights being one on one warfare, with great dishonour coming from having outside help. Preferably these gunfights aren't a one shoot kill kind of thing, but a way that the world becomes partially seperated into certain clans, and one clan's actions may have a reverberated effect on all else. Well, that's weird enough at least =P Then of course, you have either the singular hero, or an ungoverned group, a group not associated with any others, a group with no bounds.  Or you could have a singular hero, and a servant of him, who will take his place once he falls... Imagine it now, the hero is draped and hidden, but with a strange gun clutched in his right hand, elongated to look almost like a blade, and engraved with a symbol of a tiger, with claws upfront, ready to strike. The gunfight starts, everyone moving in a dash, dust is beginning to build up in the air untill almost all you can see is the wake left behind the movement of the bullet. Suddenly, *chink, chink*, he's out of bullets, so he almost slides to a corner of a building. There, his servant is waiting for him, with bullets dangling from clips on his shoulders, and a vest full of armaments on him. There, he does a last check of the golden bullets, tipped with a translucent blue, and with the speed of lightning, drops them into a clip and passes it to the hero, where he succinctly replaces his ammo and returns to the fight.  If you could only see the dust and bullets echoing inside my head... =P   STUART  One of my best friends, and a great buddy when it comes to creativity, has been GROUNDED... ahhhhhhhhhhh..... Why you ask? Because he forgot to hand an assignment in on one day. His mom is an authoritarian, very very rigid, and because of this he has been grounded, at the very least, for the whole of holidays. DARN!
