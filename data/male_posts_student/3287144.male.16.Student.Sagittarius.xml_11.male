After the exam I went in to town to see someone off on the bus and then decided to stop by the record store, during my time there I managed to kick the store clerk [well kind of nudged him with my leg] and bought a Joy Division t-shirt.  Only when I got home did I realize Joy Division never released any official t-shirts [can't remember where I heard that but I think its true], but its not too bad; I only know one other person who knows of Joy Division so I doubt they're going to tear me down for wearing a fake, assuming they know it is.  Finally my horoscope tells me to look for romance. Hmmm.  Music: Joy Division - Love Will Tear Us Apart Mood: Relaxed! Site:  urlLink http://www.horoscope.com/
