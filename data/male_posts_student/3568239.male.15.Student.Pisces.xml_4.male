I'm really bored :-) I have nothing to do.  I went to a movie with my friend Maggie, that was way fun!  I got in a couple of word fights with my best friend and ex-girlfriend, Mandy.  I thinks it's ok now, she just doesn't trust me.  We would probably still be together had we not if 'stuff had not happened.  I wish it hadn't.  I used to really not like her new boyfriend Nic Lake, but i figured out that hes ok.   Well I have to go out side away from the computer *shudder* on this very awesome day!  I love all of you, -Danny
