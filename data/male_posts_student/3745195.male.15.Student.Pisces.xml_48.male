Like she comes out and sits right by me while I'm IMing people and then I have to halt my conversation and nothing is said until she leaves. If I was hiding anything from her that was potentially harmful to myself then I'm sure I wouldn't be talking about it with my friends. I understand that she wants to be a part of my life, but if she waited for me to share information with her then she'd probably get more outta me. Catch you cats on the flip flop later
