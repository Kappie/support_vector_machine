(You know, the assessment that tests everything that you were supposed to have learned in high school and is a large factor for college selection.) Although I had planned to prepare for this test months in advance, I didn't get around to reviewing until only of couple weeks ago. Somehow my planning turned into procrastination, so it didn't do much good.  Although I'm confident that I did well on the English and reading portions of the test, I'm not so sure about the math and science. In fact, I barely had time to finish those parts.  The time given for those parts allows for less than one minute per question, and that just won't suiffice on nearly half of the questions. I can only hope that my poor performance in those areas won't make my score plumet into oblivion. I'll just have to wait four to seven weeks for the results. I hope that I passed at least.  If not, then I guess I have next year. I better start studying...
