I want the stars to come out, even though I have noone to watch them with.Blah.  Why do you guys fight in my shoutbox? It's just trading random insults for no reason whatsoever. And I don't even know a Steven so apparently it's attracting strangers.  If you don'twant to read this, 'Steven', fuck off and don't. I honestly don't care whether you read it or not. I'll still write in it regardless.  --Aaron
