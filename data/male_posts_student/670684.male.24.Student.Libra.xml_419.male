I started one yesterday, but it just didn't have the spark, and I didn't have the time to redraft it, and we were going out, and if I get it to people a few days late, I feel like the energy held today will be gone.  Letter writing is an exact science in many regards, much akin to any formulaic writing, which is what most writing is, really.   I drive today.  To Albuquerque.  Then on to Palm Springs.  Got 2-3 weeks planned there...haven't vacationed that long in years.  Hopefully I can knock out an outline and a few pages of this script I've got floating around.  24 hours of car ride won't hurt the creative process.  Maybe I can also think of where I'm going to move after this.  That's the really big one.  I have ambitions, I have dreams, I have goals...but I need a city.  I'd like to have a home again.  I could make San Diego my home, but it is so far from everything I've come to know.  I'm taking nothing and no one, and yes I'll have old friends who are great, but I don't feel like leaving so many of the new ones.  I like the South.  It's comfortable.  I've grown to love it.   That's why the job is so important; it dictates where I go.  The Maine thing seemed pretty nice, except for where it was.  Another job like that would be okay, but not really what I want to do.  I've got this year to write.  The original plan was to nomadically travel a bit.  I'd love to still do that, but fear crept in with my dad's death.  Fear existed regardless, but underlined and boldened by that.   It's going to work out.  I will make it work.  This is what I want to do.  Schedule.  Structure.  Something wonderful to pass my days with.  Work.  Hard work.  Good work.  Honest work.  And a city that I can call my own...at least until I go back to grad school for the Ph.D. =)  Kansas, you were great.  And a staff I will miss tremendously.
