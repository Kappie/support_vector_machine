Top drug researchers huh? It's always drug "researchers"...     PEOPLE concerned about drug-induced psychosis can call the SANE Australia help line on 1800 688 382.    				  Make sure you check your parents! According to statistics, one in 10 of the original one in 5 are dependant,  so, if there are 4,000,000 adults in Australia, 80,000 use it weekly, and of that 80,000, 8,000 become dependant.  I blame Queensland, they call themselves the smart state. Nobody there is smart, it's just a big marketing con! Viva la Victoria.  Okay, okay, i'll go do my stupid English thing now.
