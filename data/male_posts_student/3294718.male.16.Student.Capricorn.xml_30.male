Not to mention Bush is only helping by digging his own grave.  O yes, I borrowed (stole)  "Pressure makes diamonds." Hobie also donated the catchy "The man with a plan" thing. Got new guitar strings after school (finally). Thats good. Did some other stuff and then went to my orchestra concert. Thats about it for today.  (Josh's Note): Borrowed is such a pretty word. Let's use stole.
