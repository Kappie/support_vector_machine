The public transportation system here is like looking at a buffet of all the different varities of people. My favorite stop on the T thus far would have to be the South End because thats where all the hott gay boys get on. They're like the cream cheese won-tons... Anyways, we've probably spent the majority of our time riding on the green, red, and yellow lines and sitting in the Common, Jason playing with his sidekick and me talking to Brad and Preston while I drool over guys and scare the shit out of the squirrels. Jason has a feature on his uber-sidekick that lets him put people on a speakerphone thing, so the patrons of the Boston Common that evening got the privlege of listening to me and Preston fake phone sex as Jason walked through large crowds of people with his sidekick's speakers blazing. Today we went back up to Harvard so I could take some pictures, then pretty much road the T around until we had to head back to Jason's house to get dressed to go to his dad's country club. I must say that dinner at Brae Burn was the funnest meal I have had in a long time. In the course of the night's activities I was told by Jason's dad I could go to NYC today to meet the one... the only... my HERO... William Jefferson Clinton!!!!!!!!!! Jasons says he doesn't know for sure if it will actually happen. While we were at the country club Jason cut himself on a glass that he broke from squeezing it too hard and took a few napkins back to the car to stop the bleeding. Once we got back as he left the car he said, "Wait, lemme get my blood rag out of the car..." totally unaware this was a term used to describe tampons. Mia noticed and commented on how dirty Jason's vocab was. We also got to meet up with some friends/relatives of friends of Jason's at the Mall and I bought a round of Passion Herbal Tea Lemonades for everybody in Somerville. THEY WERE NASTY!!! At the other Starbucks they tasted just fine but good god these last ones were horrible. I was appauled at the nastiness of it all. I mean, wow, just awful. I've been making good use of Jason's webcam and alot of people have see me in motion for the first time and all the compliments were VERY MUCH appreciated. Thanks so much. You guys made for a major self esteem boost.  I have taken an interest in a couple of guys over the past few days. Three in particular have caught my fancy. The first is TJ. He goes to Capt. Shreve with Brad but is thinking of going to Magnet next year *crosses fingers*. We're gonna be meeting up for a movie sometime this week if all goes according to plan. I KNOW AUDREY I SHOULD BE DOING MY READING!!! BUT HES TOO CUTE TO PASS UP THIS OPPORTUNITY!!! He and I actually talk about meaningful stuff. Its not constant flirting like usual. I feel like we would go really well together because there would be actual conversation instead of just useless crap. Number two is Steven. He's older, but that's a good thing. More mature guys usually work out better for me. The best part is... HE HAS A CAR AND WILL DRIVE TO KEITHVILLE. So I can see him on a regular basis. In case you're reading this Steven, no I am not using you for your car. I'm only happy because it will allow me to see your sexy ass often =). Steven and I will also hopefully be meeting sometime this week if all goes according to plan. He's a musician too and has sent me a few clippings of songs he's working on. He's got real talent and creativity and I absolutely love them. I'm definately looking forward to meeting him and if I'm lucky, seeing those songs played for me in person. Number 3 is Sean. He's really far away but  absolutely incredible. He's got a wonderful personality and would have to be, by far, the sweetest guy I have ever met in my whole fucking life. He too is a little older, but like I said its a good thing. This guy is one of the hottest boys I have ever seen in my entire life. He could have any guy up in Pennsylvania he wants, but he is going to drive 2 fucking days halfway across the North American Continent to Louisiana just to see me. All I know to say is just WOW.  The moral of the story:  For Boston, for Boston we sing our proud refrain For Boston, for Boston 'tis wisdom's earthly fame For here all are one and our hearts are true And the towers on the heights reach the heavens' own blue For Boston, for Boston 'till the echoes ring again  For Boston, for Boston thy glory is our own For Boston, for Boston 'tis here thy truth is known And ever in the right shall our heirs be found 'Till time shall be no more and thy work is crowned For Boston, for Boston 'till the echoes ring again
