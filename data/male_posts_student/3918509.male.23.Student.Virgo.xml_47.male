I'm working on an essay on third parties, and on Christians and voting, but neither can be written off-hand.       So you'll have to make do with some thoughts on Sandy Berger.  He was President Clinton's National Security Advisor and is (was, he just resigned today) a top advisor on the Kerry campaign: he is  urlLink currently under investigation  for removing classified documents from the National Archives.    According to Berger, he inadvertently removed the documents and then inadvertently destroyed them.  An honest mistake, that's all.  Sorry.    I don't see how he expects us, the American public, to buy that, let alone the FBI.  He was a National Security Advisor for at least four years (was he there all eight years?).  There is no way he did not know the rules about handling sensitive information, and I simply cannot imagine that someone who had been in his position of responsibility would become so sloppy and careless to accidentally remove secret papers and then accidentally dispose of them.  It's possible, to be sure.  But it so stretches the realm of credibility that I find it an extremely dubious story, though I suppose it's a better defense than saying he removed them on purpose.  I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I'm finding it hard to believe.
