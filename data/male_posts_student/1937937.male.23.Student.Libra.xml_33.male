It's always like this for me right before I begin a new round of classes: not exactly anxious, but just awake.  I knew that as soon as I finished my exams, I'd stop posting here as often.  Also, a friend of mine e-mailed me and said that the site was "stupid... no, sophomoric", so I got a bit embarrassed.  But basically, fuck him: he was just kidding, anyway.  But I took it to heart.  Plus, I thought to myself: what are most 23 year olds doing?  Are they making weblogs?  Especially weblogs about themselves?  Well, I've tried to make these blogs about "current events" or "mathematics", and I never keep them up!  So I'm just going to have to go with this for now... besides, it's fun.  For me.  Not necessarily for you.  Especially if I'm standing over your shoulder, making you read it.  I need to sit down with Rick and Marcia and discuss the fact that I'm interested in moving.  I'm sure we can work something out financially: the lease, which is not actually "binding" at this point but I'd like to respect it, ends in August; thus, even if I do leave within the month, there will only be two months that I need to pay.  Or whatever.  We'll see.  I looked at an apartment today in "The Mark Yacht Club" -- it was gorgeous!  I mean, I was totally blown away.  It's $2,000, and my friend Brad wants to pay $1,200 of that.  I'd  really  like to live alone, but this almost seems like to good to pass up.  The thing is, Brad and I have a certain professional (is that what I'm calling it now?) relationship which precludes moving in together; thus, before we'd move in together, we'd have to end that particular interaction, and that'll be a shame.  I bet you have no idea what I'm talking about.  In other news: Women want men to be princes and kill giants.  More on that coming soon.
