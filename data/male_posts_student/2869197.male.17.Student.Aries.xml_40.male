I plan to go shopping, mostly behind windows, perhaps attempt some behavior modification (more on that later), and go hiking. I recently got some lovable hiking boots and am itching to test them out.   Yes, bev mod. I learned of this in Psychology class (where else?). It basically entails giving yourself rewards and punishments for your actions. Example: If I do my homework for 30 minutes every day, I can buy a book at the end of the month. I figure it's worth a try; I have no self-discipline and anything that could either fix or bypass that is welcome indeed.
