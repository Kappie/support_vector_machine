They will be discussing a wide range of global issues both economic and political. The tense situation in the Darfur region of Sudan, which is a human rights catastrophe as described by the UN, will be taken up today, also expected is an announcement of some kind of an aid package for the AIDS affected African nations and the rising oil prices. But still this summit is an incomplete one as the Italian Prime Minister said, Why you may ask because two of the most rapidly growing economies of the World both India and China are not involved in the discussion. How can World leaders discuss global economy without the participation of these two nations in the debate. One can only hope that the leaders of the western democracies will pay heed to what the Italian PM has said.
