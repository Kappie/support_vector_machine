While talking to some friends on  msn , i got accross fileplanet and noticed that  Ground Control  (From  sierra ) is now free to download. It's a nice game, but i just tried the  Homeworld II  demo and THIS is a threat. It's actually the game with the best graphic displayed on my screen since i bought it in 2003.   Got bitched around by a girl on msn, why can't people leave you alone when you need to? I believe you don't need to be  Einstein  to understand that.  2 more tests this week and then it's finished until August, Canada, here i come!  Regards,  Zephyr
