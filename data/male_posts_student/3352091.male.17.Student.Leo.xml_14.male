I dreamed that i was in an irish pub playing the saxophone and that was the whole dream, i was just playing like smooth jazz and then some upbeat stuff. while its easy for me to translate others dreams its hard to translate your own (personally i think it takes an objective mind to do this) so if someone reads this and had an idea just post it here as to what this cool dreams might mean lol
