Hopefully one that Tay or Schilling won't be at because they are both the biggest jackasses in the world.   Now Jason and Mattson are off to play Madden. I hate Madden but for some reason I own it. In other news, Goat show down will be sometime soon. If you hear some baaahs of anguish, then you will know it is because Team Goat got their asses kicked. And that will happen so prepare yourself for the baaahs.
