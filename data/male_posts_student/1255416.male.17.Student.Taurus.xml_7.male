Not even that, I could have given away the TWO invitations i was given for a combined total of an amount of money I don't really want to think about.  Damn it all to hell.  But beyond that I'm doing pretty damn well.  Finals start on friday and I already have 75 percent of them done.  I've got very little forseeable homework (actually, a grnad total of 2 assignments) and am secure in the knowledge that this time next week I will seriously be rocking out to the fact that finally, finally it will be summer (4th period off, bitches!).  Oh, hope you like the new look for the blog, wanted people to comment.  By the way, for anyone interested in my oh-so-well-informed political opinons (hell, if you read this thing) check out my and Joe Seago's political debate blog at pinko-vs-biggot.blogspot.com.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised over who's the biggot and who's the pinko.  Man, i crack myself up
