(and an excuse to conveniently deny my precal text's existence.) not that i enjoy the anal-retentive essays and ridiculously meticulous questioning in the multiple choice, but it gives you a reason to remember the more important aspects of the curriculum. as in, i still don't give a crap why *insert 50's sitcom here* contributed to the supposed homogenization of american society, but i appreciate being able to connect the middle east and vietnam in a more thorough manner. chemistry shall make my tear ducts flow, however. FLOW.   urlLink iraqi prisoner abuse . no long-winded speech from me today. i agree that these soldiers here are pathetic, utter crap. at the same time, i've had it with democratic critics like ted kennedy (my favorite kennedy ever) and every liberal newspaper on the planet who perpetually espouse their self-righteous bullshit of "it leads straight to the top." even though this shouldn't have happened, this is more of a reagan-esque sleeping on the job mishap than a hierarchical collapse of the military. let the prison guards' immediate supervisors deal with this crap. anywho, i think it's ashcroft, not rumsfeld, that should go.    urlLink last samurai ! that movie is hella hella cool. if you haven't guessed yet, i have it and i want to watch it with friends after testing is over so i have an excuse to go driving. on a second viewing, it's still a crazy good movie, although it focuses on tom cruise a smidgeon too much. after katsumoto dies (such a great scene) and the uncultured fartfaced japanese soldiers bow, why are we still gaping at tom cruise's unblemished mug? the emperor is hella cool..."we have weapons and western clothing. but we must still remember who we are, and where we come from."  holy shit, all of a sudden i have stuff to talk about. here we gooo...   [+]  urlLink harry potter 3  baby! with that edgy new cuaron director person, supercool gary oldman as sirius black (who WASN'T sexy in the books, a fallacy widely spread by an iranian person from greece whose name rhymes with parisa), a badass-looking malfoy and the best actor of the heroes in rupert grint, it should be a LOT better than the first two. [+] i have changed my brackets a bit:  spurs over lakers in 6 kings over timberwolves in 7 pacers over heat in 4 pistons over nets in 6  spurs over kings in 7 pistons over pacers in 6  spurs over pistons in 7 the lakers, indeed, are nothing more than a grouping of individuals...an exhausted shaq, selfish kobe, passive malone and OLD payton. all the west teams besides the spurs are having their lack of cohesiveness sorely tested, and san antonio shall pounce like rabid, sars-infested dalmations. the wolves and indiana need better centers, which is also the only true weakness of san antonio. [+] spiderman-2. it looks beautiful. as i worry with all hyped sequels (see above), it better look like the first. in other words, no excessive special effects, no drastic mood changes, no ugly plot contrivances. that's why lotr worked so well, because it flowed so smoothly from movie to movie.
