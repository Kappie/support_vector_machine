I wish I wasn't such a pansy though....THAT kinda sux.  I'm sure I'll get over it eventually, someday when I stop thinking that everyone is better than me at everything....Wow, I'm a loser.  I'm torn between whether I should ask her out now, before she leaves, or after she gets back and prom is over...I'm sure I'll make the right decision.  Today is gonna be FUCKED up, I mean..I gotta make it to an orthodontist appointment at 3:30 I believe, I'm supposed to go to the Mall of America with Ervin and Kyle, and I have to see Keli sumtime...I don't know how I'm gonna do it all, I must trust in the force.  It will be my guide....GO DORKS!  Alright, I think that's pretty much it..... Peace-Out!  I'll miss you Keli..  Spense
