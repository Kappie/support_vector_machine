Well that shit took forever to get done, I was just way too tired to do it and all, so then when I got back I decided to get online and look at some stuff...I guess I was lookin at CO2 pistols this morning or somethin which led me to go out and get one from Walmart, I got a $90 retail Gamo P23 for about $60. I havent gotten the chance to take it out and fire some rounds off because all the ammo I have is a box of pellets, the gun can shoot them one at a time, but whats the fun in that when you can fire off 9 bb's in row??? And my mom wants me to get some safety glasses so I dont lose an eye or somethin, fuck that!!!! But yea, after I got that I just came home and did practically nothing for a long ass while and then finally got to talk to Tasha for a while...Then tonite I ran at X-Country, I went about 5 miles which aint too bad but I just wanted to get home...So I got home and grabbed a bit to eat then took a long ass shower and played some CS, then, luckily, Tasha got on!!! Woohoo..except we never talk too much online. But when she called around 10:00 I was all excited and I got a rush of energy real quick and we had a lot of fun talkin on the phone, lol, I cant remember anything really that we talked about, but it was fun! So after we got done on the phone I got on here and started writing in my blog again....and then guess who called.....Tasha!!!! Well she's dumb and she has a ghetto tv and vcr and it was only showin stuff in B+W. Amazingly, I couldnt help her...mostly just cause I'm all tired and cranky but yea...now I feel bad...just cause I didnt fix something with electricity in it!!!! Rarrrr....but oh well, its gettin late so Im gonna be headin off to bed hear pretty quick......
