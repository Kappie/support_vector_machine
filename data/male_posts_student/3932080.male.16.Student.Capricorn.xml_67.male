Rosie  and partner  Kelli Carpenter O'Donnell  were married in late February and spent a week in July on the cruise, experiencing everything from New York to the Bahamas in the company of 500 other gay and lesbian families. The documentary was filmed by  Rosie , who is blatantly in favor of pushing the liberal message behind the cruises. Asked for her comment,  Kelli Carpenter O'Donnell  enjoyed the sea trip but didn't see the need to go to such lengths, explaining that she "doesn't usually have to leave the house to see a whale."  0000000000
