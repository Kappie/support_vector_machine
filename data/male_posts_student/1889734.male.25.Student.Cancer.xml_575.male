Most of you probably won't care about this, but it contains three things that interest me.  1). An example of poorly thought-out government reasoning. 2). Idiocy by the French. 3). An example of the havoc of price controls on drugs.  Aventis is a French pharma, and they've been in trouble for a long time.  Sanofi is another French pharma, also not in the best of health.  Primarily, this is due to the price controls in Europe, which fail to reward R spending by limiting the profits gained on any drug.  Most of the EU pharmas are existing on drugs researched long ago, and most are reaching the end of their patent lifetime, meaning that they go generic and anyone can make them for cheap.  Few new drugs are in the pipeline, and that's where the money is really made.  Aventis was tendering offers to be bought, and Novartis, a Swiss company, issued an offer.  The Aventis shareholders were leaning toward accepting it.  Then the French stepped in and put a stop to it.  The French government, citing national security needs, flexed their muscle and encouraged Sanofi to make an offer for Aventis, and encouraged Aventis to accept.  Essentially, the Novartis offer would be stopped cold by law if it went forward.    So France artificially pushed two ailing French companies together as one large, ailing French company, and the shareholders of Aventis were forced to accept a lower price on thier stock.  The message to investors is - your money is not wisely invested in France.  I hope they lose capital over this.  The essential heart of capitalism is letting the market decide, and letting industry die if it cannot compete.  Propping up failing business does more harm than good.  Look at the steel industry in the US.  Or the airlines.  Let the market run it's course.  I hope the French and the rest of the EU keep right on making these decisions.  Viva la France.
