My first thought was like: "Has he started skipping sat classes to go to hoshi-chan's house?", then later I asked hoshi-chan and she's like: "no... haven't seen him...", and I was thinking: "ohh... he must be sick... I should phone him", but then hoshi-chan phones him first and then tells me: "Keane didn't go to sat class cause he slept in."  *Face-fault*  ... and there i was hoping he was ok...  grrr ...    On to sadder news... I got 94% on mid-term exam and 91% in midterm overall for my sat class... and I hafta say that really sucks. No really... it does... cause this stuff is like extremely easy...   Started playing a bit of Warcraft... haven't gotten addicted to it... and I hope I don't...*mutterz*  3vil 3ric...     On a misc. note... i think we should end off all the blog entries with something that can snap you back to the top of the page... think anchors.
