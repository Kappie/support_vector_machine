       
      A few things:   1.   For the first time in my life, car repairs have actually cost LESS than I was quoted.  2.   I feel like a giant in my little Chevy Cavalier compared to the nice roomy interior of the 2004 Honda Accord that I was renting.  3.   It's good to have my car back.  4.   No more having to explain why I don't want to drive somewhere.
