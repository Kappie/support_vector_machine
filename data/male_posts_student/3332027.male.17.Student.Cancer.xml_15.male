She won so I had to teach her my signature lap dance. Well today, she told me to forget about that and meet her at funstation to "hang out". That smelled fishy to me. She doesn't like arcades so I thought maybe it was another hook up. She's trying to get me to forget about my ex so she's setting me up with people. I told my ex to call my phone at around 6:45 P.M. just incase it was a hook up. I told him that I keep getting setup. He thought that I moved on quick. I figured out something. I called Christina to find out what's going down and I told her that I couldn't go because of something important. She gave up the lie and told me there was gonna be someone there for me. I told her off and went back to talking ot my ex. Christina just wants me to move on and fuck 'em. The truth is, I never moved at all. I'm still his and I'm waiting until I'm his again or if he moves on, I will have to move on too. I'm afraid to tell him about those blind dates because I don't want him to say fuck it and forget about me. I told him that today. He wants me to be happy. I told him what is the only thing that would make me happy and I know i'll never get that. We just talked for awhile. He hasn't called back, so i'll call him back. Around 9:00 P.M, Christina called me and had the nerve to put me on 3-way with the blind date. The dude was a complete dickhead. I cursed him out and told him that I have an STD and someone I'm completely involved with already. The guy said I was a nasty man-hoe and that he was out. I started laughing and told Christina to stop doing that. We argued and bitched for an hour. It's 11:38 P.M, and I'm gonna call him back. I want to tell him this, it's funny.!!!    This is the first time I'm using a song that has nothing to do with Hotel Paper!   "Something's missing And I don't know how to fix it Something's missing And I don't know what it is, no I don't know what it is At all  I can't be sure that this state of mind Is not of my own design I wish there was an over-the-counter test for loneliness For loneliness like this"
