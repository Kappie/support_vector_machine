I already figured out first impressions online (when I "met" the same person twice, once on AOL and once on Yahoo - he thought i knew it was him, I thought he was completely different people, it was then that i learnt the impact of first impressions)   But what if you already know someone online and then meet them in real life? Does your opinion of them change? I could understand if people didnt really think of online people as people, and  therefor meeting this net person was like a "new" person who you just knew alot about the background. I could also understand if it was like meeting a friend you hadn't seen in 10 years and you kind of have to re-evaluate your relationship to see if it is still where it should be. And then it might just be like meeting someone you already knew. And then there's the question of how much all of this changed when you add in audio chat, and then when you add in video conferancing...
