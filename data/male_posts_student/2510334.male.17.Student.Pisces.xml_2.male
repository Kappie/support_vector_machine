You can actually get an award for blogging from the guardian newspaper (a v. posh paper read by nearly employee of the educational system in the UK)  urlLink Guardian Article  2. It can actually get quite expensive to blog up to $130 for a years worth of blogging 3. In my opinion most blogs will never ever be read because of the time needed to trawl blogs to find a subject interesting to you but you might try  urlLink BlogPulse  4. And perhaps the single most important thing I have found out is that there is no perfect formula for blogging and its best to keep it simple and write a load of crap off the top of your head like I'm doing right now...  So, blogging, a valued tool to all Microsoft employees who dedicated minutes a day to enlightening their colleagues and captivated customers on, what I am sure to be, ground breaking developments.
