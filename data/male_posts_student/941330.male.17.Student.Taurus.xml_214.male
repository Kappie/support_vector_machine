"NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league only recently became aware of large parties planned in Las Vegas and elsewhere around the country." BULLSHIT,  urlLink they've known for years  or else they're absolutely blind and brainless, they just want to be the only entity raking in the dough for sunday. "As far as I'm concerned, the NFL is full of soup," Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman said. "I would tell them to go shove it."
