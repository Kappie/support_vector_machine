Win.  Played some Civ3 multiplayer with Dave and Jon yesterday, it's not that good multiplayer, cos I find it goes too slow, and then I talked to a most drunk Alice on msn, she was drinking jug after jug of pimms, then I went off to said party - for which I had only 5 mins warning of - "We have to leave. Now."  But right now my throat is sore, and I just finished my coffee, yeh I know I should be drinking tea, cos it's tastier, but I figure coffee = more awakeness.  Right, that's all the talking you're getting from me, 2 posts in 2 days? CRAZY
