Now i got to save money for all those wonderful presents that I'll be giving in December. Well I hope they'll be wonderful anyway, depends on how much I save. But I do love buying presents for people. I'll probably go broke again, haha. Oh well, that's what aunts and uncles are for, they give you money when they couldn't think of anything to buy you, Haha. That always refills my wallet. Haha. Ok so Merry Belated Christams in July.
