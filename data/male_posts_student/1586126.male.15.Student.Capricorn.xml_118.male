XD  it looks so cool heres what u gotta do:  -get some gel, hairspray, and your hair  i made big chunky spikes, so what i did was to wait for it to dry when its dry, i work spike by spike without water.   what you do to each spike:  you grab a chunk of hair and twirl it up. While holding it with one hand, you put gel on it with the other. i put lotsa gel on it while i was at it.  after youre done with your spikes, grab the hairspray and put it all over, lots of it, or itll fall after a while.  youre done! dont move until its kinda dried, cuz itll fall :P look at the pics:  urlLink SpikedHair002.jpg  and  urlLink SpikedHair003.jpg
