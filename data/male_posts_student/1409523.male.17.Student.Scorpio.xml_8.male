Good Friday... technically it should not be good and all (seeing as Jesus died today) yet i can't help but enjoy myself.... i went to my grandma's as i always do today and stuffed my face full of as much bread, tuna, and elephant ears as possible... technically i shouldn't be eating in between today but my philosophy is if i never stop eating ill never be eating "in between"  ... lets see what else is on my plate... no pun intended... hmm..well i just got about 15 cds in from the library (if you are reading this lisl those were great recommendations... especially Mehldau) anyways so i should be busy for quite a while....i think i am going to sit down and relax now.. this may be the first time i have done it all week....
