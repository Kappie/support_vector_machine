So with my three-hour class starting each day at 9:00, and it being about 14 degrees Kelvin outside, I've been grabbing a cup of tea the past couple of days (I'm not into coffee; I'd rather be a little sleepy in the morning if it means I've got no problems falling asleep at night).  So today I put in a little bit of what I assumed was sugar, from one of those glass sugar containers with the little metal spout.  But I noticed when I was drinking it that it was really, really sweet.  I didn't think I'd put in that much sugar, but....  So at the break we've got in the middle of class I went to refill -- it wasn't sugar; it was Equal.  Man, that stuff is powerful.  2. There's a terrorism class in a room across the hall from mine.  I don't know the professor who teaches it, but I think there'd be a good joke to be made if it turns out that the professor teaching the terrorism course is truly terrifying.  Sorry.
