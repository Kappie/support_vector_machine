Thanks to Justin Timberlake, the entire country had the opportunity to see one of Janet Jackson's boobs on live national television! A smutty day, indeed.  In addition to the surprise titty shot, today's Superbowl was a great game! It came down to the final seconds of the game -- you really couldn't ask for a better Superbowl.  We had some special visitors to our dorm today: a couple of state troopers! Bob and I were playing a game of Counter-Strike at the time. Due to the loud nature of Counter-Strike, we didn't even notice the cops were in the dorm until they shined a flashlight at us. I almost shit my pants when I saw them, knowing that there's approximately 20 things in our dorm that could get us in deep shit. They asked us if we knew anything about a "suspicious green backpack" that was found "somewhere around the building." I later figured that they were using that as an excuse to check the dorms for people kicking back to some beer before the game. There was some tobacco strewn all over the table (because Zach rolls his own cigarettes), and the cops asked if it was weed. Please keep in mind that tobacco looks absolutely nothing like weed. Little did they know that Bob's fridge was packed with beer at the time, and that our couch is stolen from the hall. Cooper 207 came out unscathed! Man, those cops were fucking dimwits.  Ugh, a full week of classes to look ahead to. Happy happy, joy joy!  -BIGsmut.
