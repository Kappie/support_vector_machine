I supposed i have MCS... i often felt that i am unfairly treated... for instance, my sis did well for exam, my parents bought her a hi-5 set... i wanted too... my mum say i can share with my sis...  finally!!! i did well for my exam... i requested for a mp3 player... not a hi-5 set... my mum say she will buy for me at a later date... [which may signifies NEVER!!!]...  yesterday, my mum ask me to help my younger brother wash his school shoes.. i say why... she say u muz help your younger brother, he is younger than you... then i say he promised to help me wash last time, he oso nv... my mum shouted "why u everything jin jin ji jiao [muz count so clearly]?" then i say he so big size, taller than me, fall sick oso can wash his own shoes wat... my mum say u jealous for wat...  I was like thinking "What the?!?!" it's like all my fault liddat... freakz...
