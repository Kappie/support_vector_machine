It doesn't really start until Sep. 6th, but today was a sneak peek. I had already seen a handful of eps in japanese via the Intenet (thank you Internet!). But hearing it in english is a lot better. Psy of Fireball20xl.com missed it and now he's all mad. So until next time, ...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
