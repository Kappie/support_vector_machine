Fortunately, with the wonderous internet, it will become much easier. This year, we are signing on to  urlLink Tesco.com  . For those who do not know, Tesco is a massive food supermarket chain. They offer, on their website, an 'online shop', where one can browse through items you want, add it to a cyber-trolley, and pay for them at an online checkout where you put in your credit card details. In the next few days, a Tesco van will pull up outside your house, and deliver these items  to your door. All you need to do is unpack! Well, it so happens that the cottage we are going to be staying in is in an area where Tesco will deliver. So on our arrival day, we should see a Tesco van sitting outside, with all our food needed for the next few days. You'd have never thought it'd happen!    urlLink Dawn Eden , who I met last week is back from her travels. Go check out her blog at  urlLink www.dawneden.com/blogger.html   Right, thats all from me. G'night.
