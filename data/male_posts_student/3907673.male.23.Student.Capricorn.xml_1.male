Everyone was there waiting in class for the teacher, Mr Alan Tan to come in to class. But at 9am, another teacher came in and told the class that Alan Tan was on urgent leave which means that the lesson is being cancelled.   U guys might think that all of us would be damm happy as there's no class. But NO.. all of them their face turn black. must be wondering y rite. Cause most of them stay in the east and they had to spend on transport and also having to wake up early to rush to school, then turn out to be in class only for half an hour and dismissed..   Whew, lucky for me, i stay nearby, but well, it was really a wasted trip. i could have slept longer or even plan for other programs. Anyway, wat a wasted day.   Bad things aside, nw for the happy part was that i got the job as a cashier at carrefour and would be starting work on monday, hehe. Hope that class would not end late on monday, as i've to reach plaza singapura by 1730.   Well, think that's for today, tomolo still got practical lesson.   Cheers and nite. Thomas
