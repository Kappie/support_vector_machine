We did a free show for 450 people there this past Sunday, so we're hoping that packs our Thursday night Chatham show, as well.  I'm out.  Just wanted to check in.  Grace = gone.  Ooh... cool Kierkegaard quote---  "And the people crowd around the poet and say to him, 'sing again soon'--in other words, may new sufferings torture your soul and may your lips continue to be formed as before, because your screams would only alarm us, but the music is charming."  I realize the last 24 hours worth of entries have made it seem as though I'm unhappy.  I'm not unhappy.  It's a weird thing to describe... everything in my life is as I want it to be.  I'm doing the things I want, I'm moving ahead at my pace and doing the things I need to do.  My friends are wonderful.  But there's that one little thing that's missing, and that not-so-little thing is really becoming crucial now.  Whatever.  I'm done.  I'll write more later.  Call is in an hour and I haven't eaten yet at all.  Save two Dole raspberry popsicles.  Mmmmmm.
