Today's lyrics.. here they are:  It's the luck of the draw How you wound up with me You don't know how at all But i beg you to stay Crawl around on this earth While the world's still small  Honey don't think About it too long now Honey don't think You're liable to figure me out  Something wrong in my stars Could you look at my chart Help me healing these scars Could you learn to read minds In the case of mine Do you read in the dark  Honey don't think About it too long now Honey don't think You're liable to figure me out You don't wanna figure me out You don't wanna figure me out Don't wanna lose  Honey don't think About it too long now Honey don't think You're liable to figure me out  Honey don't think About it too long now (about it too long now) Honey don't think You're liable to figure me out  Honey don't think About it too long  -Grant Lee Buffalo, "Honey Don't Think"
