"How can Republicans find unlimited amounts of money for war, for killing, and for destroying, but not a dime for peace, for building, and for creating?   The WarDebt clock is ticking at a rate of a billion dollars every few days. Just think of the good that much money could be used for, such as our country's infrastructure, preschool, children's health, public education, college scholarships, aid to veterans, helping our elderly, prescription drugs, and public housing.   It is easy to convince a Republican of a need to kill people, but almost impossible to get their support to help people."
