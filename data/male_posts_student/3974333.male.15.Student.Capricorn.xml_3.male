I believe a few months ago, I wouldnt have cared about it, though I'm only young I reckon its essential for me to have faith in something. I saw this picture and it reminded me of something that my grandad said to me. He said "Try to think about faith, think about it in the form of a tap, if you allow it, and turn the water on the amount of water coming out is totally up to you, that tap won't turn itself." That really opened my eyes. In this day and age I reckon a relgious identity is what I need..
