I for one didn't really mind it, and in the end enjoyed it like any other Sunday. It's cool how God can always make a crappy day somehow turn out good in the end. He seems to make everything right always....no matter how wrong life can look at times.  So starting my day wakin' up at 730am, I quickly ate, did usual morning stuff and then headed to church, all ready and such for Sunday Morning Worship practice. Got there a bit late....and already I thought "Ok we gotta start this now." HOWEVER, yes....I still had to fix up Slide Show Presentation to fit with the order....something I believe Josh shoulda stayed online for last night instead of sleeping. And then afterwards, yup Steph wasn't b/sing when she said last night no trombone today. So yeah...basically I wasted 40 minutes of my morning doing jack, however harsh sounding this is but yeah I myself felt that worship this morning was not what any of us hoped for. The fact that all the songs no one knew, and low rehearsal time also added to this, making today like I said before not one to be remembered for effort. So Josh, Rebecca, Steph, if this seems a bit harsh, well it's true. I actually felt this way....and there's not really anything that can change history now. So when worship started...yeah I didn't pay much attention since I barely do anything today anyways....so I might as well had slept in 50 minutes and not even bothered going there early. All I had to really do is get the Slide Show in order...something that should have been done the night before.  Sermon today unfortunately still had abit of aftermath from the earlier things, so I didn't really pay attention, and used the time more for reflection....on things like "how did we even think of doing worship this week?" or "Why did we put forth only 60% instead of 100% of our time into this?" Maybe the others don't feel the same way as I did....but it's pretty crappy hearing Josh say he needs his sleep when I myself only got 6 hours....because I didn't know what the heck I was doing for the whole time while making Presentation. Oh well...so yeah before I knew it service was over....apparently thinking can make time go by REAL quick.  So after service, I went downstairs as usual. By now I felt that I had no need to be angry anymore at the events of the morning, so I went about with my day, and I felt more relaxed and not as peeved as the day went by. So first off with Bible Study, we had a guest Jason Perry come in today. He tought us a different way to do Bible reading (I normally do the Lectio Divini way...spelling?) But he tought us the AEIOU way:  Ask Questions Enunciate (emphasize some words) In Your Own Words Other References Use it  I guess it's a somewhat interesting way...and it never hurts to learn new formats of doing devos/ just regular Bible reading. Also with Jason being an undergrad psychologist...yeah when me Gavin and Rebecca thought we knew what the passages meant...he could ask the most simple question...."Why?" and we were all stumped lol. Oh yeah and Rebecca burned Carmen and Lina today pretty bad too lol. Basically calling the two blondes/ditzes....Oh boy lol.....never thought Rebecca could pull a burn like that lol. So me and Gavin afterwards branched out from the burn, and yeah that was talk of the town for a bit haha. Oh yeah and the thinking of how Carmen and Lina could actually figure out a Bible study together LOL. I know its ounds kinda mean but after Rebecca made that Brulee....yeah me and Gavin went overboard on the burnages lol. Oh yeah and also I made smiley faces on Rebecca's shoes =P. After the lesson *and brulees*, Calvin, Jason, and Gavin came to my place...  Where we ate Dim Sum, played some PS2, and then headed out for ball. PS2 was pretty funny......and oh yeah I switched Jason's MSN name...which he recovered but when he saw it *quote*:  "DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO WRITE THAT NAME OUT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"  Thank goodness he has message history lol. Anyways......after fixing that *I think* and whooping some ass on NFSU, BALLING TIME!  Basically for two hours....we played basketball. some 3's, 4's, and 2's almost at a time but then eventually turned into 3's lol. Kendrick and Thomas came for a bit also....and also playing 4 on 4 full court....lol it turns to be as exciting as golf after a while. Ugh....I need to work on my driving again....get stuffed almost everytime I go for layup....except for the one good time where I actually completed a decent crossover and finished also. My defense is actually somewhat tolerable now, though I need to work on stuffing still, but man to man coverage I'm getting decent at now again...well when I actually try to do defense lol *this isn't including our one on one games where a pylon is more effective than me Jason.* Anyways....so after two hours of that, headed home....pretty tired...and my feet hurt also heh.  Played some NSFU again until they left, then SCed for a bit. Showered, ate, then did my cosine law math homework. Ugh so stupid.....and now I've forgotten Sine law lol.  So....as you can see my day turned out decent. I think God put those laughs in today for a reason, as they really did cheer up my day from the sluggish morning start. Anyways...I'm out for the night...and yeah Thanks again God for lighting up my day =).  Oh yeah and Jason found his 3cm cockroach/ant....well w/e it is anyways lol. Hopin' to see it on Friday when I go over haha.  Later.
