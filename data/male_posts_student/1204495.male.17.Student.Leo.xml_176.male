Postman Danny, Postman Danny, Postman Danny and his black and white Jess, All the birds are singing,  And the day is just beginning,  Danny feels he's a really happy man.  Everybody knows, his bright blue clothes,  All his friends will swear as he waves to greet them,  Maybe,  You can never be sure,  They'll be a thump,  whack,  He’ll walk into your door,  Hay hay,  Postman Danny, Postman Danny, Postman Danny and his black and white Jess,  All the birds are singing,  And the day is just beginning,  Danny feels he's a really happy man,  Danny feels he's a really happy man,  Danny feels he's a really happy man.
