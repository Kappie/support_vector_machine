This woman ate McDonald's food all her life then blames the restaurant for making her fat.  NEWS FLASH: It's her own fault for shoveling all that sludge into her pie hole.  Someone made a documentary not too long about in which they ate at McDonald's 3 times a day for 3 weeks and gained 25 pounds.  This person really needs a get a life (and go on a diet).  Just recently however, a woman wrote a book about how she also ate at McDonald's 3 times a day for 3 weeks and  lost  10 pounds.  The difference between these two individuals is that while the man ate double quarter pounders with cheeseevery day, the woman ate salads.  (If you haven't had the California Cob salad you should really try it)  This lack of responsibility extends into other areas of life as well.  Example: Girl has sex, gets pregnant, has an abortion.  It's not her fault she had sex.  The abortion is just an easy way for her to escape taking responsibility for her actions.  Its sad and scary the way this country is gone.  At this rate, in 50 years we'll be a nation of fat people and trial lawyers, suing every company into bankruptcy.
