Actually the Aeta I've met have been very industrious so I'm sure this popular misconception is unfounded.    Arnel explained that the Aetas live for the present and do not generally have any long term goals. However the leadership and organization courses that are scheduled later this month will be the first steps towards the Aetas having a substantial community plan and direction, self-management and hopefully empowerment.    The Aetas eat like there's no tomorrow. I was told that it was because they usually don't eat too much when they are back home (just kasavas) and we were providing food for the tribal councils so they seriously grubbed.
