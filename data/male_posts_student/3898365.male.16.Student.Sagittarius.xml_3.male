Doesn't he talk about how sometimes you just have to stare at a wall and things move? Something like that. And so Rosso gave him the career survey to see what he would be good at. But just because he had a guest spot on "Freaks and Geeks" doesn't make him a cast member of the show.  Goddamn, I miss that show. I know it's on dvd. I should Netflix them all. Although that would take forever. My family puts movies on our queue, and then when they get here (which only takes two days), they never watch what they order and they just sit on the kitchen counter for weeks. It's irritating. I've had  Manic  and  Dummy  and  Liberty Heights  and  Pee Wee's Big Adventure  and  Gigantic: A Tale of Two Johns  on there for over two months.  Yesterday was better than Monday. For me, at least. I think my class experienced the low point of our three weeks. The day started out with us discovering that someone had broken the front driver's side window and mirrors of the short bus we use to get around. Just fucking shattered them. Yet, the front door of the bus was still unlocked and everything we left inside remained. Cowards. At least take something as proof that you did it. There was glass all over the driver's seat and the floor and the pavement around. We had to spend a good thirty minutes cleaning everything out. While we were doing that, this lady that needed the bus next to ours revealed that someone had broken into her bus too. Nothing was broken and nothing was taken, but there were cigarette butts all over and what looked like urine sprayed all over the seats, floor, ceiling and windows. It was so icky.  But luckily our bus was urine and cigarette free. It was also lucky that it was so damn hot outside and Mr. Gilford would have rolled his window down anyway, had it remained intact over the night.  We spent our time in more shady areas so I didn't get as hot as I did on Monday.  Oh, bees. At the second site we went to, on the path about three feet from the stream, there was this giant log that had a bees nest inside it. So after about half the class stepped on the log to get across it and down to the stream bank, the bees started getting pissed off and attacking. This one kid, Bobby, had two or three stings on his hand and on his back, Andy had a couple on his legs, and Mr. Gilford had at least four or five stings on his legs. It was weird when they first started their strike, nobody really knew that there were bees around until Gilford started hopping around slapping his legs. It was fairly humorous until I realized that insects were boring their sharp-as-nails stingers into the skin on his legs.  But I got away bee-sting-free! Although a couple huge-ass mosquitos bit me on my hand and arm. Now I have these huge, itchy, red swells on my hands.  The rest of the week is just inside work, which is great. We've spent today in the computer lab and will continue to after this lunch break is over. Dude, today, Gilford said we can break for lunch from 11:30 to 12:30. He's like meg awesome.  Nah,  Feed  slang doesn't work for me. Null.  Jenny walked over to Safeway to grab some lunch. I should've gone with her. But nope, I'm lazy and tired of walking in the hot hot sunshine, and I needed to type this out, because I'm a slave to my blog. My sexy, sexy blog. So now I'm sitting here typing, drinking my Code Red and listening to BK's great, great, great cover of "My Drug Buddy." It's nice.  I had good talks with Amy last night. I realized some things that I need to try and take care of. It's gonna be hard, but I don't think I can be happy until unless I at least try. And I still think Amy should take my advice, because it's not good to let things fester inside you.
