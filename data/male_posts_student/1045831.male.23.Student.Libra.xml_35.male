They were just looking for one cocktail waitress...  When i went in they made a point to say to apply for bartender and door man..  You look at me and know I am in no way a cocktail waitress..  The big red headed cocktail waitress..  just imagine me in a pair of tight pants walking around taking drink orders..  doesn't work that well..   well anyway..  Friday I went to work and then I went to McBrides had a few Beers with Bonomo and Sieckman then to Coach's with them...  Sat I hung out with my mom for a while.. we went to the Kona grill cuz my Dad and Sis were out of town..   It was pretty good..  I drank some scotch and ate some Sushi..  Then went to Lawrence and to Toms'..  I went to the bars wth Toms, Sieckman, Whitney and this girl Kim who came up to see Sieckman..  She was pretty hot and I guess after the bar her and Sieckman had some crazy sex which Is good for him...   Other than that not much happened just a traditional sat night..  Ohh I forgot to say that Paul got mad at me for some stupid shit and started acted like a four year old..  That kid acts more like a chick than most girls I know..  Who can explain these things..  Well I'm off to jump in the shower and go work out.. I'll comfort you guys with more tales of my life later..  Your Hero..  Zeke
