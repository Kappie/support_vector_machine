As it was, I did the usual go-to-bed-late-and-wake-up-early thing for the paper due today, so I'm tired.  Of course, I've been telling myself the same thing for 6 or 7 years now, so you would think it would have sunken in by now...  Oh, and then it was raining this morning.  I don't know if I have bad tires or if I'm still getting used to the manual, but I swear I spun my tires six or seven times getting to school and then to work.  One time...well, let's just say hydroplaning isn't the right word for it.  Fortunately, it only happened in first (my nemesis!).  I think that Wendy's is starting a new ad campaign or something.  I stopped by to pick up something for lunch, and I swear that every person I talked to said "See you tomorrow."  Now, I hardly ever go there, so it's not like I'm a "regular" or something.  I think I'm not going to go there tomorrow just for that...  Hard to believe that yesterday I was running around in shorts.  Looking outside now...yeah, it's snowing.  Pretty hard, actually...the roof opposite my office is totally covered.  Maybe we'll have a white Thanksgiving? :-P
