First, Samiam said:  What that moore sayes is truth?? sorry to offend but he is a bafoon in my opinion driven frome birth by overexageration..How can anyone posibly believe him??? He has done nothing but Bash bush since he took office,some will say anything to advance a agenda...his movie is a exageration..of his own opinion  Cactuscat later posted:  I just returned from seeing the movie, and it was amazingly powerful. I think every democrat should take a republican friend to see it!  Which got Samiam going again:  To acomplish what? Im sure that probably all republicans know it is nothing but propoganda! If i went to see it i would probably be sick..I seen what happend on 9/11 and ervryone that did should have the same view, Stop terorist's and there money sources..to manny people died to not do anything,and for moore to make a movie intending to discredit action by i feel one of the only Administration's willing to make a stand!!! No NO nO, maybee a republican should take a democrat by the hand and pray nothing like that ever happens again in this country...To me its not about left or right,its about pay back long over due...Unless others think that we should just allow the building of threats to our freedom..God forbid thousands die again simply because moore said we are wrong....  Then Cactuscat responded with:  I have some questions for samiam. Like "payback long overdue" for what exactly? Since Iraq had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks on the US, what is the payback for?  There was more, but those quotes capture the essence.  Samiam - the ball's in your court.
