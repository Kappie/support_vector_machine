So yeah I'm pretty much screwed, I just have to wait this one out I suppose. I hope it goes away pretty soon, I've taken 6 Tylenol now and they haven't done a thing for me! Headaches are like the biggest annoyance I've ever experienced. I think this one is a migraine though, I can't look at anything bright without it making my head feel like its going to explode! Well anyway, I managed to mow today, that was such a fun time! Let me tell ya! It really wasn't that bad since I had my Simple Plan CD in the whole time so that kinda got me in a better mood. Speaking of Simple Plan, I have to talk to Courtney about concert plans since we only have 5 days left. I'm not sure the best way to get there and all so we have to set all of that up pretty soon. I checked the weather for Saturday and it is 76 and Sunny so that rocks, the UV index is going to be high though, 9, so I better bring some sunscreen or something meh maybe not, I actually like a good sunburn. Well, I must go now, I need to go lie down or something, maybe it'll help...
