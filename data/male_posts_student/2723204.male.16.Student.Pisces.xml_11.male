There are alot of Birthdays coming up, lots of piscesians............ Ben's, Woon Han's, Xin Yun's so I gotta really budget lol, gotta get presents.............but I think its good, to really celebrate birthdays as a group, there's really a sense of camaraderie in that, much deeper than just camaraderie i must add. But above all, not only I'm gonna get presents but also a new wallet............so what do I do? It can only be summarized into 1 word.........BUDGET !!!! .........and hopefully I won't have to approach the IMF (my parents that is....) for a loan package to tide over this period of economic slowdown.  and for some..........uhhhh...........eye candy........here's a pic of a really kickass guitar............  http://www.projectguitar.com/gal/2d.htm  yeah, very classy imo, white hardware against a blue body............  okok, enough about guitars, and back to my life............music wise, yah, like I said, I just gotten back into my guitar playing mood. And I've got a whole series of tests next week, so gotta really study.........on MSN now, with only Chin han doing maths online now.........lol........i'm pretty guilty, cos' i've got maths homework not handed up...........so I gotta cheong this weekend and hand it up on Monday.........hmmmm.........  ok this blog dao ci wei chi, btw, I've got a geography competition tomorrow so wish me lots of luck.....
