Anyways, my grandma brought out a piece of cake she had saved from her wedding (remember wedding was in 1954!)! It had been wrapped in foil and left in a pantry! The cake, originally white, was rock-solid and brownish, black - kinda looked like salmon. Oh, on a sports note, the  urlLink Tour de Lance  jk. (France) started with the prologue. Lance Armstrong (he's shooting for his 6th win in a row - never done before!) placed 2nd in the prologue today. He did 3.8 miles in under 7 minutes. that's fast by the way!
