Hm.....what happened today....Focus was an entire waste, I just sat in the broadcast communications room staring at the wall basically...because the group using the computer ahead of us was a fuckin' slow ass bitch!!  and he should be dragged into the street and shot :-D  That would make me happy...and a lot of other people happy too....because it was Jim Linehan.....stupid fucker.  I bet my friends were in Mrs. Loney's focus talking to Tina the whole time again......god she is pissin' me off.....I swear to god she is slowly stealing my friends.....and me not talking to any of them at the moment doesn't really help that much...but......that's another reason I did this whole thing, as a test almost.....to see if they would still be on "my side" after I don't talk to them.....and if they aren't......oh well....then they weren't good freinds in the first place...and I shouldn't have been friends with them....but if they are, then they are doing exactly what they should do......am I sick for playing tests with peoples heads??  Or am I just WAY TOO PARANOID!!!!! I still think she's stealing my friends....if she were to decide whether she hated me or not...this whole process would go smoother....because than I could hate her and not feel bad, even though at the moment I don't feel bad......GIRLS ARE SO.....no....not all girls....TINA IS SO CONFUSING!!! How hard is it to make up your mind?!?!?!?!?! Seriously.....and as for my friends....wtf are you thinking?!?!?!?  Sure, you have your free will and all, but......REALLY.....DOES LOYALTY MATTER TO ANYONE ANYMORE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  God.....I sat down writing this and I was totally calm...and now I'm a frickin' ragin' psycopath.......I'm gonna go listen to music.....  Spense  P.S. Yes, Brittany, I still read your blog, and you haven't totally lost a friend...just....I can't talk to any of you right now...because I'm getting ready to*or trying to right now* get rid of my memories of Tina....which are quite a few....because she is *as far as I know* just booting me out of her life....and so.....I'm trying to return the favor...even though it won't matter to her.....but......if I can associate anyone to a memory of Tina, I can't be around them for a while.....because it brings back that memory...and then I get sad.....because MOST of the memories were good....mmmm.....back seat......who?!?! what?!?!? oh....nuthing..I wasn't saying anything......but...I should probably go now..before more memories arise.....Peace Out!  Spense  ME AGAIN!!  O.K. So I just read Brittany's blog...and it talks about how Tina is "trying to make things better between us".....frankly......I believe this could possibly be what I would like to call.....BULLSHIRT!!!  She has never even talked to me...or contacted me in anyway..so...how exactly she is "trying to make things better"...I have no klue....even though that DOES make me feel a little better...and I think I might be ready to talk to you guys earlier than expected...which I think most of you need....considering two of you were farely sad about me being all :-X-like....oh well...I'm gonna go back to......doing.....sumthing.......which I haven't decided what it is yet......Peace!  Spense
