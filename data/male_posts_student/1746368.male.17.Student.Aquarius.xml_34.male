Yesterday I read a lot. This morning I finished that book and now I'm reading the next one. I am more than halfway through it and it needs to get better or I'm going to drop it like a hot coal on a summer day. It's not that the book is boring, it just hasn't interested me yet. If a book is not good within the first few chapters than what good is it to even have been written? Anyways, I'm extremly bored and I needed to write in my journal today. A few people have called this journal "interesting". Quite frankly I don't know what they are talking about. The last time I checked my life was pretty boring, but amusing to most. Well, that is your guys opinion. Enjoy reading my journal as much as you can. I already enjoy writing it, so now it's your turn. This will probably be one of the shortest journal entries on account of me doing next to nothing today. I did get McDonalds for lunch, but that is the only time I left my house. Have a great night everyone. Sorry if this entry wasn't that interesting.    *EDIT*  Tomorrow may or may not be a different day. I should be online more than I was today, but I'm not making any promises. My mom and I are finally putting my shelf up and we need to get some anchors (hard to explain). She and I are also going down to Funcoland in Dublin and I am probably going to buy either Mario Golf or a MegaMan game. I will try and turn my computer on when I wake up, but I might get distracted by something shiny.
