I did buy a pair of pepe jeans and a pair of pepe shorts and white uptowns. We went to Perkins which wasn't too bad. I rather eat at Jonny Rockets, but it wasn't too bad. I wanted to order a steak, but I lost my appetite so i just ordered a melt. Tomorrow I have to go to some party that I was dragged into. I heard there will be kids my age and filipino...(oH BoY hoW FuN is ThiS GoiN 2 bE, FYI: i hate hanging ot with out filipino people my age unless it was my bestest friend in the world Maria and this eye candy guy name JefF)I'll be sure to wear something that will make me fit in so they wouldn't notice me and i can get lost. I don't really want to be bothered by those suburban people. I'm hoping that we can find a mall to go to so i can extend my birthday shopping. (LOL) Ya i didn't get to buy my jeans a matching shirt. I also need to get a bookbag for school this summer. For 1 month, I will be attending CSI taking PSY100. WhoOp-t-dO   *I'm starting my ex-boi intervention. The first step is admitting to myself and blow the cloud of illusion that will be back together. I had faith, but fate has made up its decision. The hope and faith for him now dies and from the ashes a rebirth of my faith, not in him, but faith in myself.   Here is the 1st song: Christina Aguilera - Walk Away. The song admits that I do have a problem and what I need to do. (Some parts are bolded to really admit it)    What do you do when you know something's bad for you And you still can't let go?     I was naive Your love was like candy Artificially sweet I was deceived by the wrapping    Got caught in your web And I learned how to plead I was prey in your bed And devoured completely    And it hurts my soul Cos I can't let go All these walls are caving in I can't stop my suffering I hate to show that I've lost control Cos I, I keep going right back To the one thing that I need to walk away from    I need to get away from it I need to walk away from it Get away, walk away, walk away    I should have known I was used for amusement Couldn't see through the smog It was all an illusion    Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds) Woke up in love and seems so great (deeper, deeper) We both can't subdue Darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)    I'm about to break I can't stop this ache I'm addicted to your lure and I'm feeling for a cure Every step I take Leads to one mistake I keep going right back To the one thing that I need...    I can make it It's some state I'm in Getting nothing everytime What did I do to deserve The pain of this moment And everywhere I turn I keep going right back To the one thing that I need to walk away from    I need to get away from it I need to walk away from it Get away, walk away, walk away    Everytime I try to grasp for air I get smothered and this sky, it's never over, over Seems I never wake from this nightmare I let out a solid breath, let it be over, over    Inside I'm screaming Breaking, pleading the world Ahh...    My heart has been bruised So sad but it's true Each peep reminds me of you    It hurts my soul Cos I can't let go All these walls are caving in I can't stop my suffering I hate to show that I've lost control Cos I, I keep going right back To the one thing that I need...    I'm about to break I guess I missed it I'm addicted to your lure And I'm feeling for a cure Every step I take Leads to one mistake I keep going right back To the one thing that I need...    I can make it It's some state I'm in Getting nothing everytime What did I do to deserve The pain of this moment And everywhere I turn I keep going right back To the one thing that I need to walk away from    I say... I need to get away from it I need to walk away from it Get away, walk away, walk away    Only thing I need to do is walk away    I need to get away from it I need to walk away from it Get away, walk away, walk away  I need to get away from it I need to walk away from it Get away, walk away, walk away  I need to get away from it I need to walk away from it Get away, walk away, walk away
