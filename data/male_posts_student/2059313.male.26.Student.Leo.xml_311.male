I'm sure most of you are aware of the stunt where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts.  So...   Do you think that:  A)  It was truly an accident thanks to too little or no rehearsal of a movement that was to take place during a performance. or  B)  It was a publicity stunt to get their names into the press.   Short and sweet or long and drawn out... leave your comments and votes....   NOW  !
