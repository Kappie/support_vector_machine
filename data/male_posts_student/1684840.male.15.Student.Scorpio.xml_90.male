Plus, Spirit had a file storage problem!  It's always a computer fault isn't it! heh  Britain has now entered the sub-zero temperatures that is mid-Winter.  The air is getting colder and more quiet every minute.  It's as if you can tell snow is coming :D  Mrs. Bladon must have the plague or somethin; she has been off for a while now! (YESS! Because French is utterly boring!)  We had tutorial today so we didn't have the Perminator for a lesson.  Ah well, we're only doing the amtosphere (BORRRING).  Checketts wasn't so bad today either, she seemed a little more frosty than usual...
