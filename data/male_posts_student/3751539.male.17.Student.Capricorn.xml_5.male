Who will read my blog?  Some friends, family, but if I don't keep it interesting many will stop.  If I don't make sure there is something to keep drawing people back, many will not come back.  Why do I write this blog?  Sarah did it.  There was a dream there.  That was why I started writing it.  I had a dream of writing and people reading, being enlightened.  Getting out all the thoughts and ideas I want to tell people and usually don't because it is too strange or uncomfortable or the oppurtunity does not come up.  I don't think that is wrong, but I'm in danger of making my blog strange and uncomfortable, if I haven't already (por ejemplo; all I've already writtn in this blog so far).  I want to make reading my blog a pleasant experience.  I want people to come and be enlightened.  So, first: the ideas need to be worth reading; insightful, original, and at least semi-applicable to people's lives.  Second: It needs to be well written; organized, readable, making sure that wherever I break the rules of grammar it is to some effect, and is still clear.  Third:  It needs to be written in a positive, true tone; no negativity or pessimism, and with an eye to the great oppurtunities ahead, although a variety is still necessary. So those are my resolutions for this blog.  It means I will need to take a little more thought about writing it, but the possibilities of this medium are huge.  So many people, so many views, so many thoughts to search through.  I wish that there was more truth out there in these blogs.  That is going to be my omniresolution, to put truth on this site.  Sorry when I fail, but please be open, and take the time to check back every so often.  I think it may be worth your while.   A blog is an interesting thing.
