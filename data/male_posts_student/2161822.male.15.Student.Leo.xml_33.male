So, I woke up to go to Spanish class for 4 periods and eat brownies and drink iced tea. Yep, I didn't wanna go either. We did however get to watch the video of my U.S. History teacher when he was on Jeopardy. He owned the first round, but it all deteriorated after that. So beside that and stuffing my face with food, school was a waste. A third of our class was absen...skipping today. About 20 kids. Funny how 20 kids absen...skipping today is alot for Hafey, but for the high school, 20 kids absent is equal to 1 kid absent here. So that makes me feel very special because over the high school, I would mean jack. But our class isn't really the cream of the crop either. I can't wait to get to college. Escape from hell..er Hazleton finally and experience a better way of living. Compared to the life of a high school student at Hafey, it must be better. And if it isn't, then I will be very disappointed. Anyway, today after school I thought to myself "What a great way to celebrate the last day of school before Christmas vacation by going down to the court to play basketball and toss the pigskin." So me, Neil, and Matt go down to the court. It's usually just us since I live right by it and Neil lives close to me and Matt lives somewhat close to me. So basically, we live close to the court. Anyway, I get there, and the court is filled with puddles. And of course Neil doesn't bring the broom to sweep the water off. (Sadly we did try this, but in fact it worked. Sort of. It just kind of moved the water to a different section of the court.) So we start playing basketball and it doesn't go to well considering our skills that we never had aren't too polished. Let's see, how bout we toss the football around. Well, this worked better than basketball, and we actually played for more than 3 minutes. But "monkey in the middle" gets old after 20 minutes. If you know our court, (which you probably don't) there's a playground right by the court. And we usually go over there to fool around since we suck at basketball. Well I go to the swings and wow. What happened. There are 2 massive puddles underneath the swings.  MASSIVE . They were about a foot deep and covered with a thin sheet of ice. Of course I had to still swing on the swings. It worked well until I jumped off and landed in a huge puddle of freezing water. I'm already wet and cold, so why not step up to a dare. Somehow I end up standing in the middle of the ice cold puddle-lake for 3 minutes. The water was up past my ankles and I had shorts on too. So after the first 30 seconds I lost all feeling in my feet and my ankles turned a weird shade of bright red. Of course after I finally got out I couldn't feel anything. In fact, they hurt pretty badly. And they still are after 9 hours later. Yes I am a retard. After I finished being an idiot, we went back over the court to have a half court contest. Sadly, we're better at half court shots than normal free throws. Recap what I'm good at: not basketball, standing in ice cold water for x amount of time, and half court shots. Yep (points to self) this kid's a winner.  Listen to H.I.M.
