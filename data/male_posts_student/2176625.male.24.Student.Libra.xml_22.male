Out of all my female friends she is the one I can always count on and I do hope she feels the same. Get out of your pjs, shower, eat  something  because you can't survive on water and celery, go somewhere and think. Please come over. Call me. Don't shut me out. You live in Detroit but I swear I will come see you any time of the day at a moments notice.
