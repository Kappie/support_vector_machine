What are they you ask? Well, let me tell you...        Chris' Vacation Thoughts:   - Dairy Queen is a dirty resteraunt franchise.. Under all of the DQ signs you always see another sign underneath that says brazier. What the heck? What do ladies undergarments have to do with ice cream?  - Clint is such a balla name! I wish my name were Clint... Everybody would throw me parties... or name a sandwhich after me... Yeah, I love sandwiches.  - What's the deal with that Oprah chick anyway?  - If I had any super power it would have to be the power to ROCK! I would just whip out my guitar and strum such a fine ditty that everyone would be way better off than before. I would also solve world peace with my Rockin' power. And make a fine chicken scanty!  - Notable observation: Why are there no pretty girls in Colorado? I swear! I was there a whole week, and do you know what I saw? NOTHING! I'm dissapointed in you, Colorado...  - What was the name of that 80's sitcom with the family that had a pet sasquatch? I used to love that show!
