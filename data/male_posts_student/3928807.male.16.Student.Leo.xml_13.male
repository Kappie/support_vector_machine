I think I have a fairly good chance of being invitied back next year. I have a Mcdonalds interview on Thursday. I'm not sure whether I want to work there or not. It is the last week of camp and tonight is the staff banquet. Last time I went to a staff party, I got high, which just backfired. This time i'm going to get drunk. Damn, I am pathetic. Whatever.  I tried shrooms with Darren... they didnt really work because we didnt eat alot. Basically I only got the very very small effects like feeling warm and comfortable. I'm not going to try them again for a long time. They are unsafe. I talked to my cousin Adam yesterday about pot. It was an akward  conversation but for some reason I felt I had to. When I was with Darren, I saw Ricky again. He seems to be cooler now, but looks can decieve. His girlfriend is amazingly stupid. She didn't know what a bigot was. I think Max gets back from his camp pretty soon. I have to get gum surgery 5 days after camp ends, which sucks. Speaking of sucking, tomorrow at camp is parent day and it ends at like 8:00.. and then on Friday we have to clean up the camp.  Summer is almost over, but I don't mind. I think I had a fulfilling summer. Sam got some sort of part time job every Tuesday working at his friend Chris's mom's place where he has to tutor kids or something. I would pay to be able to come visit him and work and see what it's like. Today is his first day. So anyways, i'm trying to figure out if I really want a part time job during the year. I have to worry about community hours and homework and universities.. not sure if I have the time. Plus I think I lost my community hour sheet when I was throwing shit out. Which means I lost like 8 or 9 hours of community service.. I hope grade 12 will be cool. I know it's not going to be a walk in the park.
