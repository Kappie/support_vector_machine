So we got to thinkin about talkin to him about joining.   And in recent updates, we're gonna change the name. To understand it better as a reader let me enlighten you on what we do as a group when were not practicing. Josh  I are very disturbed young men  we have a lot of pent up rage inside, so when we get together we usually break stuff, or take stuff, hurt ourselves or eachother in increadibly idiotic stunts, or get people pissed off at us. So Josh got to thinking and now we are gonna  change the name from "Under War Torn Skies" to "Deffient Youth."    So thats the recent band update. Enjoy.
