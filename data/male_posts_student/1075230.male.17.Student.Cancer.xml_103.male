I called my parents, so they said that they'd bring it at 11.30... they were 15 minutes late...  Kyle came with us to Parkway Mall... I told him he couldn't come... he came anyway...  Emerson was there too... We left after class, but not before meeting Lynn and Renae at OCS.  ====notfinished====  Ugh... too tired to finish this tonight... maybe tomorrow...  -ArV
