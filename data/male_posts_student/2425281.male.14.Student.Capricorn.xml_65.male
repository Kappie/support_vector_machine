Grandmaster cHoWy'  GM-cHoWy aka Mr Match has been called on by Fox Studios and sent to an unknown part of the world. It actually has been TV's biggest plagiarised practical joke, bigger than the Joe Schmo show. GMC actually thinks he is up to win $100,000, when in fact he is being set up by a secret lover, Grandmistress cHoWy! Why is Fox doing this? Because the idea was copied and they can get him to do stuff unimaginable!  Find out weekly on Introspective.tk for the next installment of CounterAttack - Feat. Grandmaster cHoWy
