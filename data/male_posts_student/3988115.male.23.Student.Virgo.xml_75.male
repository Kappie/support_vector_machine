That is, for pictures that are already online, (for images on your computer you would have to use Hello or Flicker). Here is how you do it. To insert an image in your blog, (anywhere in the blog, you don't have to put it at the top) simply click the "Edit HTML" tab while you're typing your message and type this code tag:  I can't type it all in one line or it thinks I'm making a real link to an image.  Type this first   Then   inside   those carats you type this:  IMG SRC = "http.address.com" get it?  So you have the first carat:   then you type:  IMG SRC = " urlLink http://www.address.com " and then you have the last carat: />  You can click over on the "Compose" tab again to see if it worked. Like I said you can put this tag wherever you want, and as many of them as you want. So you can fill your blogs with images of oh-so colorful things.
