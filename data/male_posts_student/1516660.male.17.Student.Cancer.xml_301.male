The stupid thing started when we went to YJ to get done with the withdrawal process. The trouble is with the stupid process itself. WQ has to go find his teachers to meow (okay okay, SIGN) on the withdrawal form. We had toruble locating some teachers. We met Janet and Gloria on his quest to get signatures. Sigh. I was so totally complaining (yeah, I was bitchy. Sorry WQ....but I was terribly irrtated). We met a girl la, who is also quitting. Fine. They went searching together lor. In the end, they have to meet the vice principal's signature. I waited outside the office and saw HuiLing and Julia. Oh yes, I was reading my Book 5 Clues book, so meow. In the end hor, the v.p. refused to sign, saying that they lost too many pupils (HAHA! Huo gai!). Both of them then handed in their withdrawal form, and left the school. The office called them to come back, but they heck care and just walked off. HaHa! Steady sia! Anyhoo, that's what I have been telling WQ to do. Just pon. Why bother going through all these idiotic processes? Wastage of time. In the end, he ended up taking my advice. Sigh! Seee, don't listen to me some more la.   After that, me and WQ shared a meal together in KFC. HaHa. Eat and eat and eat chickens. Meow moo!!   Hm, after that we took 855 towards Lornie Road. HaHa. I didn't really know where to get down, I only know that it is after Macritchie. Yeah....we got off at the right stop la. Meow moo. The way to Mediacorp Studios wasn't as long as I thought it would be. Quite short actually. Meow moo! I collected my tiks!! YAY!!! Hmm...have to be there latest 5.30. We have to be there earlier!! EARLIER!! Or else no place to stand le!! Meow!!   After getting the tiks, we took the bus 852 to Khatib MRT. Meow. We then took the MRT towards Woodlands lor. WQ went to tighten his watch while I went to visit Wendy and show her the tiks. Meow moo!! After that, we went back.   Hmm...I went to bath, then went online la. Oh oh! Thursday must do something for Wendy. Cannot tell. Secret. After that, we ate dinner la. I came online, then went to watch shows and came back.  AHHHHHHH! AGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE! Stupid static!!!!! I ADJUSTED THAT STUPID ANTENNA LOADS AND LOADS AND LOADS AND LOADS OF TIMES! AND WHAT? THE STATIC IS DRIVING ME NUTS! THE STATIC IS OVERRIDING MY MUSIC!!! I HAD ENOUGH!!!! I AM SWEATY, MY RADIO IS STATICKY, I AM TERRIBLY IRRITATED! WHAT FUCKING RADIO IS THIS IF I CAN'T EVEN HEAR MUSIC PROPERLY! I WANT TO SMASH IT INTO MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PIECES! (Of course, I would then have no radio to listen to) AHHHHHHHHHH!!!
