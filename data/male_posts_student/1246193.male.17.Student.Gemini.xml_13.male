Tonight I have a communication merit badge class (I don't want to go but it is required for my eagle, every benefit has a drawback).  Wednesday I go to patrol leader council meeting.  The senior members of the troop decide what the scouts will be doing for the next month.  Thursday is music festival rehearsal. Friday is music festival.  Mrs. Nolte has no idea what she is doing setting up the chairs.  She expected us to set them up without so much as a seating chart.  urgh.  I hope we sound good,  I really think we will.    Surgery last Tuesday was good.  I was in very little pain.  The anesthetic along with tylenol and codine makes you feel better.  Actually, it makes you feel nothing at all.  I shouldn't have gone back to school Wednesday.  The oral surgeon told me not to, but how can you miss the excitment of the first day of school after a break?  My mouth is healing up just fine.  Tomorrow I have another appointment in Springfield.  The stitches or "sutures" as they call them will be removed.  I was told to expect "minimal pain" tomorrow.  There is no such thing as minimal pain.  I don't deal well with pain.  The appointment is at 7:40 a.m.  We have to leave Taylorville at 6:30.  POOP.  Well, I will be off to my communication class now.  All I have to do tonight is get my card signed.  I'll probably be there until 9:00.  I hate when things interfere with sleep.  People don't want to bother others in the morning so they schedule events for the evening.  I am an early bird.  I hate late events.  Why can't we have events at 7:00 in the morning.  Much more convienient. Ciao
