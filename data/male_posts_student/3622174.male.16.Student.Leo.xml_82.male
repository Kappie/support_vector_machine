I'll have a final review of the camp and how it compared to the past two years. So, here we go.    urlLink    Eh...what? Melissa and Alex were wrestling, and the door was opened...this is where Melissa's mom walked in. Melissa jumped on top of him.  urlLink        urlLink    They continue to fight.  urlLink        urlLink    There goes Jarrod on the floor during Jonny and Jarrod's pillow fight.  urlLink       urlLink    Wooo...way to go Alex! Or not. What's Courtney going to do next?  urlLink      urlLink    She attacked him.  urlLink      urlLink    Melissa M. did this to me. I didn't realize the camera was in my face until about 1/2 a second before the flash went off. Gave me just enough time to try some kind of smile thing.  urlLink      urlLink    There's me and Adam. Neither of us were ready for any kind of picture.   urlLink      urlLink    Jonny (left) and Jarrod (right) continue their pillow fight.   urlLink      urlLink    Eh, Caitlin...what exactly are you doing?!  urlLink      urlLink    Oh. THAT. That's very interesting, Caitlin.  urlLink      urlLink    There. The finished product. Good job Caitlin.  urlLink      urlLink    WOW, that's cool! The bathrooms at TGI Fridays in Orlando had those sensor activated paper towel dispensers. Here, Alex and Jonny play with it.  urlLink      That's all the pics for now.  There's a few others, but, nobody is going to see them until I come back from the New York state.  I just can't keep going with it for now.  So, here's the rest of the stories from Camp Orlando that will wrap up this month's Nerdular Nerdance report.     Story: Universal Studios   This one isn't intended to be funny, for the most part, but, hey, it's good enough and worth telling.  Alright.  Tuesday night we had our "Team Time," where we could go off the hotel site and go to a theme park or whatever.  So, we all chose to go to Islands of Adventure.  But, Alex was feeling like going to Universal Studios, as was Lauren.  So, I went along with them.  We got on Revenge of the Mummy, the new ride in the park, and that was awesome.  They call it a "psychological thrill ride," and it was part roller coaster, part like the Spiderman ride at Islands of Adventure.  It was a bit on the short side, but, it was awesome.  We were also able to get on Back to the Future, E.T. (we all laughed at that one, even though I'm sorta scared of moving puppets).  We also got on Men in Black and Terminator 2.  We would have gotten on Earthquake, Jaws, and probably Shrek 4-D, but, the lines were insane, even when the park was getting close to closing time.  We really only had 4 hours, so oh well.  I think we probably had more fun than the other guys did.  I just don't like being with huge groups of people like that.  Not to mention, I couldn't just leave Alex and Lauren to go to Universal by themselves... they'd kill each other.  We had fun, and if we could have gotten on Mummy again, I would have, because it was just that awesome.  Getting out of the parking garage at the end took forever.  Some person somehow got his Beetle onto a curb and hit a palm tree, and traffic was backed up for a while.  Not to mention there were people in the parking garage that obviously didn't know how to drive in traffic situations, which made it even longer.     Jonny and Jarrod         These two are hilarious.  Together, they make this absolutely hilarious duo that make you want to laugh nonstop.  Jarrod is this odd, crazy fellow who likes jumping between beds like a salmon on its spawning spree.  His belching gave a whole new meaning to the word belch.  He takes his tongue and moves it around when he burps, giving it this weird, hilarious sound.  He'll do anything to make something funny...which is probably how the security guard ended up in our room.  Jonny is a second year staffer this year, and he'll be the sports editor.  His twisted sense of humor made us laugh for a really long time.  These two together are the funniest guys in our school, at least that I know of.  They deserve an award!      The Skit      The schools had the opportunity to participate in a skit contest in order to win money for new Yearbook equipment.  Last year, we decided not to do it, but, this year, however, it was different.  This year's workshop theme was "Hats Off to a Great Year."  All of the workshop instructors came up with these weird hats on the first day, and they announced the contest.  We had to create a hat that resembled our school's yearbook staff.  We came up with a parody of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  They had me tripping all the time (why me?), and they had all sorts of funny things.  Did we win?  No.  A school that sang "The Wheels on the Bus" with a hat on won.  And that skit was officially lame.  But ours...ours was awesome!    I'm sure there are more stories, but, I can't think of them at the moment.  So, if Alex or someone reminds me of something, I'll definitely post it.  Overall, this year's camp probably was better than last year's, but, I think I overhyped it a little bit.  The hotel was pretty cool, but Housekeeping and the complaints from our neighbors were really annoying.  A couple of the new staff members (no Alex, it wasn't you, it was a specific girl) got on my nerves a lot.  Even ADAM prank called my phone like 25 times last night, and I just found out about it this afternoon.  Camp Orlando was awesome this year.  I just wish I wasn't in such a bad mood for half the time.  I would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't in that mood.  But, oh well.  It was fun anyway.    That concludes my Blogging experience for a while.  I'll be back on August 3rd for more action.  This fall is going to be completely different, because I'm going to be working on changing my image, because it's going to absolutely shatter once my brother gets to the school.  I'll have some help from my friends, and we're going to make it work.  But, people will definitely be seeing a new me this fall.  For one, I'm not going to be a pushover anymore.  It's not the path I want to take.  Second, I've gotta get fatter.  I'm going to set up my own workout routine and stick with it so that I can gain some weight, because I'm just too damn skinny.  And, I'm also going to find a girlfriend, get a job, and not be tied up with my computer so much.  Yep.  I want to change.  This lifestyle that I'm living now is just pathetic.      Well, I'm leaving for the New York state EARLY tomorrow morning, so there will more than likely NOT be any entry.  So, I'm going to go up north and refresh, because once I get back, things are going to be much, much different.  To all my friends in the River, enjoy the rest of your summer.  To everyone else, continue with your every day lives.  And that's it from me.  See you guys on or after August 3rd.  Bye.
