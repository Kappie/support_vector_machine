Allegorically you could liken this to Foucault's Pendulum (how's that for a segue from the title?) as it behaves before, during and after an eclipse.  I would imagine that not everyone reading this blog knows or remembers what a Foucault Pendulum is. A Foucault pendulum is a lot like any other pendulum that you would find out there; it's a weight attached to a wire. In the case of a Foucault pendulum it is usually a very long wire; this allowed for the pendulum to swing back and forth at a remarkably slow rate. They've got one at the UN.  Here's what makes it unique: There's a universal joint at the top allowing the pendulum to rotate in any direction around it's fixed point as it swings - it'll rotate at the rate of about .2 degrees per minute. Here's the mind bender: the pendulum isn't really rotating - the EARTH is, underneath it, which gives the appearance, yup, you guess it, of a rotating pendulum.  Alright - to the point of the tangent, as it were: During a solar eclipse, the pendulum doesn't rotate as advertised. In fact, according to physicist Maurice Allais, it ripped through a space of 13.5 degrees in 14 minutes during a total solar eclipse. Whacked out - what does that mean for gravity and our planet?  God damn hicup, that's what it means.  So today's been a down day, but suddenly I check my email and... if all goes well, I'm going to be a published author.  Yeah, my article was accepted. Very cool. It's nice to have a slightly bright spot on the evening.
