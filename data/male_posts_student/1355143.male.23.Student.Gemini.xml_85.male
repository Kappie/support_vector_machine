Over here, it is scorching, there is no reason that I should be in the CPD typing away but I thought I would let you know how nice it was and how much fun it would be if you were all here!!!!!!!  Take Sunday for example, started of with an enforced lie in after getting smashed off my face on Saturday at a house party.  Was followed by a leisurely taxi to the beach with some CEMS and was subsequently treated to 4 hours of sun loving checking out all the talent that seemed to creep out when the sun shines, an unbelievable selection!  Ulli you would have loved it!  So after this relaxation I get a call offering me free tickets to Barça's last home match of the season, a couple of socis gave us their cards and we had prime position on the half way line in the second tier to see Luis Enrique play his last match.  The sun was on us until well into the second half and a couple of spliffs made it an entirely enjoyable experience.  A little local tapas bar welcomed us afterwards and after a few jarras I was ready for bed!  I can only imagine how crazy it would be if everyone who had studied here this year was still here now!  I spent the whole of last week in Paris enjoying the sun as Barca got the last of the rain out of its system.  Spent two luxury days with the fam celebrating my ma and pa's bdays (same day, bit funky huh?!?) and then stayed with my best friend from uni who has an apartment 5 minutes away from the Arc de Triomphe.  Even had the chance to have a few cervecitas with Steffen who was passing by to see some friends.  In fact Steffen and Valerie are both coming back to visit in a couple of weeks.  That means I am gonna TRY to get all my work done before that and then the real party will begin!  Anybody else fancy it¿?!?  Hope everything cool with the gang, comments galore remember.  The blog is not dead, long live the blog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Peace out, one love, respect,  A
