Keep on resisting on you’ll be dead!”  The men rushed forward, only to realize that two of them had their weapons broken in an instant. It was the teenage…  “Wu Jian swordsmanship?! You little brat…prepare yourself!”  The teenage continued to pant, he had been running and defending himself, looking for the right chance to strike back…Now is the time.  Teenage cried out, “Re…return my parents!”  The teenage ran forward and in a split second, he pierced his flimsy sword right into the abdomen of the most prominent figure in the group, blood gushed out all over his face.  The rest of the guys were stunned by this sudden change of events. The boy once again struck, this time killing four other guys with just one stroke. In the end, only one man was left standing.  “Tell me…why?! Why must you kill my whole family?! Where did we offend you?!”  “Argh….Som…someone paid us…, we’re just in…instructed to do it….”  “Who paid you?”   “A masked man, we don’t know his re~~…”  “You don’t deserve to live…”  The teenage now began moving out of the dark alley he was in…  The time and location is in the ancient times of China. The teenager’s name is Jian Tai Wu, the only heir to the Wu Jian swordsmanship. His mother died ever since he was borne, thus he has no image of his mother and received no motherly love. The previous group of people killed his family of thirteen in just one night through a sneak attack. Strangely, although the bodies of them were present, his father’s body was not there, on his father’s bed is just a note,   “Look for me”  After traveling and pondering for a week after the whole horrible incident, Tai Wu had his clothes tattered and torn, feeling hungry and depressed at the lost of his family. His eyes became misty, he was tough…but even man cry at times.  Suddenly, out of nowhere, a voice rang in his mind…  “South…head for south now…”  Amazingly, Tai Wu felt obliged and head towards south…despite feeling weak, Tai Wu just kept on running. After crossing over a last bend…  “You’re finally here…”  A vigilant looking middle-aged man with a huge and long broadsword stood there. The sword radiates a fiery orange glow. Being blinded by the light, Tai Wu cannot exactly focus out this strange man’s looks.  “You will understand all there is to it of this world and get answers when you reach there.” The huge man spoke calmly.  “Who…who are you? Wha…What do you want calling me here?”  “All the doubts which you have will be discovered upon reaching the other world, now hold this sword…I do not have much time.”  Tai Wu stepped forward and did as told, “What is the other world? Why is it that you want me to hold this sword?”  “Good…this sword is called Flamer, take good care of it as it’ll resemble your fate in the other world. Now, I’ll teleport you there.”  Suddenly, a pillar of light appeared on the ground where Tai Wu is standing.  Man,” Fire of the south, may you summon this child to the true world. Help him with all your might as he is the next wielder of Fire!”  The pillar of light explodes into a column of fire, engulfing Tai Wu who is shocked and somewhat petrified.
