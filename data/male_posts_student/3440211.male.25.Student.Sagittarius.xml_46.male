I am looking forward to that is going to be half way bettween a hackers guild and a philosophical thinktank. Also spoke about the unspeakable with my mother, that did sort me out. I know have a better idea of how to handle the thing and new regained energy after having seen so many sunrises this week-end. Its grey outside but I don't really care.  Went for lunch and a "frapee" with Sandra. No coment on what I think of it as it is still pending discussion with Thrasos.  I am working and the bugs seemed to have been ironed out. The mood is upbeat yet aware of the amount of stuff I have to do. I feel like I can kick some ass again. Lets do it....
