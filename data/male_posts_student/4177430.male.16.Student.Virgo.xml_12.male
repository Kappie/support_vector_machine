Ask anyone about his "flip-flops" and they can't back up jack shit.  "He voted for the war" well yeah, that was before anyone knew that the president LIED about the WMDs.  Many of these "flip-flops" posted on Bush's reelection site span 10-20+ years.  Four years ago, I used to think Will Smith was a great musician, but I don't now, and no one's calling me a flip-flopper.  And have people forgotten that changing your mind is OK?  Hello?  Yes.  Changing your mind...is OK.  What do we want in office?  A guy who's bullheaded and never goes back on what he says or someone who can admit when he's wrong (and been wronged).  Anyone who talks about Kerry's Flip-Flopping has no idea what they're talking about because there is, in fact, nothing to talk about.  What about Bush "flip-flopping" on No Child Left Behind--a program he praised but left terribly underfunded.  What about Bush applauding veterans, then cutting their benefits?  What about Bush flip-flopping off his bike...twice!  There isn't a band-aid big enough to cover up Bush's scabbed political career.
