So, yesterday, my mom, my grandma, and I went to the Half-Price Bookstore, where I went and blewthe money I made in the garage sale (according to my mom, I still say I've got $20 or so left). I got the first four Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books, which are excellent, an older copy of Arthur C. Clarke's  Earthlight , which is an awesome book,  The Jesus Incident  in paperback and  The Lazarus Effect  in hardcover by Frank Herbert and Bill Ransom, and a copy of CC: Tiberian Sun w/ the Firestorm expansion pack and the  MASSIVE  Prima guide, and a copy of Battlecruiser: Millenium, which looked cool. And I found a cool video on  urlLink www.homestarrunner.com  for They Might Be Giants, and I keep listening to that. Later!
