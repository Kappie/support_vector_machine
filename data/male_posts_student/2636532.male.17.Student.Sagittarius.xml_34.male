Ah yes! the other day i finally got around to seeing  8 Crazy nights  with my girlfriend, it was an ok movie i suppose but one thing i hated was ALL THOSE DAMNED CITY PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!! seriously, i can't stand them, all those know it all fashion obsessed too much make-up wearing sheep, piss the hell out of me. so fucking inconciderate too, there was a group of maybe 5 girls that were standing around talking in high, ditzy, "um, like, duh" voices, right in front of the fucking ticket counter with the sickly sweet stench of too much perfume wafting off of them. but they were right where everyone else wanted to go and you couldn't tell if they were going to buy a ticket or just stand there like fucking retards. and another thing is those stupid dance video games? seriously?? what the hell??? you get some music, find some clear floor space AND YOU FUCKING DANCE!!!!!! you don't need to spend all that money just to put some stupid numbers on a stupid screen that just shows people that you can put your foot down when the little flashy lights tell you too better then anyone else. you can dance anywhere if you really want to, and you can do it for free too. now when you get to those fighting games and first person shooters that's different, how often can you go around shooting random people? or dinosaurs? you can't! either because it's illegal or because they're extinct. Even racing games serve some point, while they aren't all together realistic, people don't have to spend years training and practising to become good enough to actually be allowed to race and they don't have to fear for their lives everytime they get behind the wheel. not to mention people look fucking retarded just stomping around, i know, i'll make a game where you have to sweep floors, not only will you be paying to do somethng that you would normally be paid to do, but i'll have huge competitions so that some lucky boy or girl can proove that they are the best. Hey, stuff that's even more impossible have happened before, like the Yanks learning how to read. -Matt
