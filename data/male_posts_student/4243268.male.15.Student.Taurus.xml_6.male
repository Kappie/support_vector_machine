I mean, friends are great, but really, what else do you need than a small machine that sits on a desk and beeps from time to time? Life's greatest companion.  But really, who's going to read this? Hahahahahahaha. Just the idea of anyone actually caring enough to read something this pointless and stupid makes me laugh. I chose a unused URL and the most boring template for my blog. Who'd want to go here?  So I'll start my first entry with why I am depressed. I went to California not too long ago for acting camp. Going in I was afraid that the people wouldn't be cool there, but they definately were. Problem is, all joking aside, I miss them like a mob informant misses his non-concrete shoes.  But one in particular - Kat. I miss her the most because in the last week or so of the three-week camp, we started a sort of sweetheart relationship kind of thing. It grew faster than any relationship I've ever had, and Kat liked me for who I was, and I liked her because she liked me for who I was. Hah, like THAT makes sense. Problem is, of course, the camp was in California. And I live in boring old Pennsylvania. Bummer.  So that more or less means that I'll never get to see Kat again, unless I come back next year. It is so depressing knowing that we'll never get to cuddle like we did during camp, with everyone pointing at us and saying "Connor and Kat!" It bites. Really. It bites REALLY hard. We still talk via cell phone and IM, but it's not the same, and any chance of a relationship has been ruined.  Aside from that, camp for band here sucks, its 7:30 to 3:30 every day, and I'm sick, and missing half a tooth on the left side of my mouth, but I still have to go. And I can't get out of it. My best bud is going to an amusement park on tuesday but I can't go. I can't even get out of it 2 hours early, let alone the whole day. It SUCKS.  Blah. I'm done for tonight. Remember folks...  DOUBLE DECKER BUS! And the chairloaf in my arm the birdy says TWEET TWEET and that's a summaray!
