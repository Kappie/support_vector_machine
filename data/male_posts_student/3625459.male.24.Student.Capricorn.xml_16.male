Why are there so many deaths? dont these people realize that they cant change the system by beheading a few.. the system cannot be changed ... revolutions just get a new sysyem in place that over the years will deacay.nothing changer .. eventually the country is run by a few , we as masses just exist .. attimes its us individuals that matter .. our petty lives all the people that we know .. nothing else .  Why do i feel sorry for these people .. feel sorry for their mothers and their relatives... i know no ones gonna grieve for me if i get killed, well except for mum   Thought of her today morning while packing my bags.. keep telling myself that its over no matter how much i want it not to be over.
