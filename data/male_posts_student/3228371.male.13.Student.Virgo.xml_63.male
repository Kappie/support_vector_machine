Yup, we talked about losing virginity and spaghetti straps and how hot it is in Texas! 30 something degrees! Whoa... I'd pass out in that temperature. Phewness~!  I miss Lisa a whole lot. I've never had a big sister... only a little sister. I've always had to teach her homework, teach her about boys, make-up, girl stuff... I've never had anyone to teach me that stuff... no one to ask for advice and stuff. I mean, yeah, you can always talk to friends but an older sister's different... someone you look up to. I'm really grateful for Lisa. I'm grateful that God blessed me with such a great friend and sister in Christ. She has guided so many people and been a great person to be around. I tell her everything and she gives really good advice. She's always been there for me... the only thing I didn't tell her about is the time when Wilfred went somewhere he wasn't supposed to go. Only thing. She was already "troubled" when I told her about us kissing. So if she knows about the "other thing" she'd totally freak out. Talked to Ingrid about this. Haha~!   There's... also this thing that happened to me a long time ago... but it always... bugs me. Nobody knows... only I do. Not planning on letting anybody else know. Scary... comes back to haunt me even years from the event. Like now. Don't wanna think about it... *sighzZ* Gonna take a shower.
