The first time I actually quit out of the window on accident, so it was actually my fault...  This second time was Mozilla's fault!  I'm sorry Firefox, you're a good program, but you crash too often (not as much as Internet Explorer at least ^^)!  Ok, so this morning I went running.  That's always fun, get up early in the morning and the first thing you do is run...  No breakfast or snack or anything ^^.  I'm actually getting better at running now.  I didn't know that running at least 3 times a week one mile at least would help so much...  Even though it DOES seem kind of obvious >.  Haha!  So I've been playing Pokemon, no wait...  Pokémon.  I can't believe that even after like... what, I don't know how many years, but a long time, it's still fun.  I'm currently playing the Gameboy Advance version, Ruby.  ROMs have always been fun, but with Pokémon, there's one thing that an emulator can't emulate... playing with other people...  I really with that they would make an emulator that could play with other people over the net...  They have one for Gameboy, why not Gameboy Advance?!? /cry  MAX 300!  Oh sorry...  Whee!  Guess what peoples?!?  I'm going to Puerto Rico next week.  Yep, that's right, you didn't hear wrong.  I'll get to have lotsa (that can't be a word, but it's so much fun to use...) fun!  It'll be cool.  Hang out with Ricardo, hang out with his friends, steal his friends from him, kill him while he sle---  I, er, mean... yeah, fun stuff with Ricardo... *evil smile*  So... uh... *checks schedule*  I guess I have to go, I'm really busy... *crickets in background*  Yeah, I'm gonna go do something productive... like leveling up in Pokémon ^^.  Oh, and remember to stab MSN Messenger.  While it is cool and all, it doesn't let me do cool symbols like ♪ or ₧!!!  Or this: ♫ ☼ ◄ ► ↕  See ya all later ^_^
