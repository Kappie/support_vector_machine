Changed song again..guess i am fickle-minded     Boyz 2 Men- Four Seasons of Loneliness        I long for the warmth of days gone by  When you were mine  But now those days are memories in time  Life's empty without you by my side  My heart belongs to you  No matter what I try   When I get the courage up to love somebody new  It always falls apart cause they just  Can't compare to you  Your love won't release me  I'm bound under ball and chain  Reminiscing our love as I watch four season's change   Chorus:  In comes the winter breeze  That chills the air and drifts the snow  And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe  When springtime makes its way here  Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume  When summer burns with heat  I always get the hots for you  Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do  When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare  When you're not here it doesn't feel the same   Remember the nights when we closed our eyes  And vowed that you and I would be in love for all time  Anytime I think about these things is shared with you  I break down and cry cause I get so emotional  Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain  Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change   (Repeat Chorus)   This loneliness  Has crushed my heart  Please let me love again  Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain  Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again   (Repeat Chorus til end)
