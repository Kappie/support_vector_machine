But people use them like they're commonplace in vernacular, as if they are cool enough to be cliche.  I remember reading an article by Tom Krasovic, the Padres beat writer for the  urlLink San Diego Union-Tribune  where he talked about Tony Gwynn hitting first in the order, and called Tony  Larry Lead-off .  Tony was one of the 75 greatest baseball players of all time, and probably one of the five greatest pure hitters...and he gets lumped in with Larry Lead-off?     Michner brunch in the morning.  The MFAs meet with the MAs from each section (Fiction, Poetry, Playwriting, Screenwriting) and hobnob, drinking coffee and pulpy orange juice.  I wanted to go...I want to meet these people I didn't meet last year but who share my passion and drive for success in the written world of the arts.  But these things are always the same...people clique off, writers from departments stay in their respective department circle, and no one meets anyone because all of the groups look so daunting, full of tall thirtysomethings wearing horn-rimmed glasses and laughing about Picasso or Isabelle Allende.    So I went out and found the stragglers, the folks without homes.  It's the most fun you can have at a party, because you don't get yourself roped in with a social circle and start talking in elitist tones.  Met a few cool folks, most from New York and the East coast area.  I'm still fascinated by everything East of the Mississippi, mostly because I've spent an extreme majority of my life surrounded by people who live out West.  And it is out West, to the Easters.    Even in the elevator today, I was talking to a sexy girl in a black cropped shirt and tight jeans, who seemed to just be riding the elevator for her own whims and fancy.  While my success in pick-ups of any fashion has been atrocious in recent memory, if I could find a way to go out with a girl who I met in the elevator, any curse I might see upon myself at this juncture would undoubtabdly be lifted.  Of course, I need to see her in the elevator one more time.    Last night was a night for the blog.  Needing internet at the house.  Honestly missed The Ex for the first time.  And the Padres got shelled.
