Surprisingly there was a heron in our garden once.  i was reading a newspaper and looked up to see a heron take its head out of our pond and then fuck off with our fish.  Then just to rub our noses in it, a few minutes later, i looked up from the paper again to see it flying off with what looked like some pond plants in its beak.  Finally the next day i woke up to find it trying to siphon water out of the bond using a bilge pump and an atlas  one part of the above story was a lie.  can you figure out which bit it is?  Yes, of course the heron didnt steal the plants: what would a heron do with lagoon like flora?    "People do get alzheimers you know"   Dan from school was telling me today about some woman he had seen walking round without any shoes, which reminded me that the day before i had seen the same woman and yes, it was indeed odd.  The person sat next to us: the harry potter wannabe sociopath, rob then said the above phrase in his typical way.  I unwittily replied "Well its not going to be an imaginary disease made up by doctors to make themselves feel good.  is it?"  and he saw that he was wrong and hence i won.    But rob also thinks he is pregnant as long as you apply the freudian idea that whatever people accidentally say must be true.  Just like when you accidentally say par cark you are actually revealing the truth that all car parks actually have a slightly different name in the real language that you must secretly use to yourself.  but maybe if freud had spent a bit more time doing work instead of thinking about cocks and taking cocaine he would have been able to make things like this clear.   so from free money, to herons, to freud in one blog.  put that in your black forest cack search engine and find some psychological deeper meaning you internet witches.
