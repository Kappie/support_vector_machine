June 2: English written exam June 4: English ISU June 8: Drama exam June 16: English exam June 18: Business exam June 25: Report cards June 27: My 16th birthday  I feel kinda weird now, because i'm sitting here waiting for Alex to call, i'm turning into one of those girls whose life is based on someone else, it's sorta a good feeling, i mean, i really like him.  but on the other hand it's not, because i love the sense of independence that i use to have, i miss it, but i like how things are like now, i wouldn't trade it for the world.    I should be doing my career studies homework, but i can't concentrate, and for the first time listening to jay chow doesn't help anymore.  i'm sitting here talking to mike about the one thing that i wish i didn't take, but it's not helping.  School is acutally getting fun, it's probably because i get to see Alex, but i'm actually enjoying the classes now, well, it's about time, i would say.  My lip is getting better, i should thank someone for that.  *wink* Today's weather was good, only if it was a little warmer, or i had a jacket or something, i love the sizzling rain, but i got a lot of goosebumps.  i'm waiting for baseball to come on, yes, i'm a toronto blue jays fan, but it's not on until 10, 20 minutes away.    apparently, i need to get my act together, i'm getting a 74 in business, and according to my parents that's not good enough, not even near good enough, in this house, 80 is passing, and if you don't want any lectures, about 90 is what's expected.  But hey, i'm not that smart, and my mom knows taht, i think she's just lecture me a bit, that's all, hopefully.  now, Alex called, got to go.  my priorities are straight, i think.
