I was supposed to mow fields for someone but they weren't home... so we tried to get our tractor started but flooded it so we moved on... 1960 Ford 601 Workmaster... Was my great-grandfather's tractor... Anyway, we moved on and went to my grandmother's house. I mowed and trimmed her yard, moved and stored some boxes... and then I had a little incident with my dad while up in the attic storing some extra stuff in boxes that my grandmother didn't need. So, he walks up in front of me and I said "Just go on the rafters"... then he goes "Oh, I see plywood over there" so he walks over and "CRASH"... he falls through the ceiling and falls onto a coffee table and tries to hang onto cords that I was grabbing onto up there... I was holding onto a beam and didn't fall. We now have a gigantic hole through the ceiling of my grandmother's family room... I also was going to put a bookshelf together and get it all situated for her... Then I find part of the shelf cracked... so we have to take it back to Haverty's. Then, we come home and my mom's gigantic gas guzzling lincoln navigator is blocking the driveway... so I rad to run in, get the key, and move that on the street while my dad pulled the truck into the front yard, waited, then parked the truck. Then, when we got inside, my mom goes "The mower won't start"... and we find that she put in Gas and Oil mixture instead of regular gas... it ran but it sputtered the whole time. Anyway... not a very good day as far as that goes. I managed to bruise my hip and hurt my ankle when I was grabbing onto that beam when my dad fell through the ceiling.  Oh, by the way, found out today my uncle died of an enlarged heart... Shelly's webcam is on but she seems to have fallen asleep... what to do, what to do... oh well... I suppose I'll sit here and wait until I get really tired ::yawn::... anyway... I suppose I'll go put the salsa back in the fridge, watch TV, maybe check ebay out, and go to sleep in a bit. I'm feeling a bit chilly. I'm going to go and check my dad's weather station thing or w/e. bye....
