I started studying here at home but sitting on the couch and trying to study is a deadly game to play with ones GPA. With out having a desk to sit at all of my books and notes were getting mixed together. To make matters worse I had a television with 70+ channels begging me to watch them. After a couple programs I decided it was time to get serious about my law exam. I packed my book bag and began my treck to the library. When I finally reached campus I grabbed a student paper to brush up on the current events happening on campus. After reading through the paper which was decent for a change I was ready to start my studies. I started for the front door of the library as I got closer I noticed a steady stream of student walked out and the lights in the library were out. What is going on I thought to myself is everything going bad for me today? I decided that it was not that. I think it is because I am the biggest procrastinator in Hawaii possibly in the world. Any way I got away from all the interruption including my cell phone and am almost done studying. Aside from right now I have not used the computer all day.
