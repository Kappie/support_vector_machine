It's finally cloudy out but not enough for rain ( i've been waiting for rain a LONG time ). Yesterday I went Skytraining with debra. For those of you who don't know what Skytraining is I will give an explanation. Skytraining is when you get on a skytrain and go to random places. We went to MetroTown and Pacific Centre/Granville Station. I bought jeans and a shirt at metro town which look good [ my reasoning for buying them ]. After arriving at Granville station we decided we would try and get to Granville Island [ which isn't even a real island ]. We got on The Number 4 Bus which said Powell, needless to say this was a huge mistake as we ended up in the Downtown Eastside. Walking what seemed forever and avoiding scary homeless people we made it back to Granville street. Where we joyously walked uphill 10 blocks [ which was great for my already aching bones ]. We stopped at subway and split a veggie delite sub which was delicious and then walked the rest of the way to Granville Station. Then we walked through Pacific Centre and skytrained to Debra's. After a quick family guy episode or two my mother picked me up. Then I had salad for dinner and watched The Secret Window. Anyways I'm off to do uhh stuff and make my blog known. I am a blogger 8-.
