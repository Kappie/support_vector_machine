I started talking to my one of my friends again today. Monica AKA monular. we went to school together freshman year, then she moved and now she goes to a different school. but hey at least we started talking again.  this year i had to "buckle down" and worry about grades and stuff cuz i want to go to college and be able to support myself when im older, but i just missed constantly being high and drunk. ive only smoked three times in the past 2 weeks... if this were a couple years ago... i couldnt have gone 2 weeks without smokin at least once a day, and im not talking one bowl, im talking fucking RIPPED off my ass. and one of the best nights of my life was when i was on x.... everything was so fucking awesome, i felt sooo good and everyone was having a good time. i miss shroomin too...  you know youre good and fucked up when your living room starts getting smaller and smaller. heh.   last year was kinda like that. but i always make friends with older people and then they go and graduate. i had a good share of my drunk and high times, and now my BEST friend in the world is moving away and getting married aug. 21st and the rest of them are all going to school and working everyday. this sucks...im going to bed.
