Lol stupid guy. Then he goes "Anyone caught out of dress code will have to wear a jakcet, tie, and blazer." (I go to a priv school and we have gay uniforms.) He was onfire with the stupid today. Then the seniors for the last day of school for them pick a song to play over the PA between periods, well aparently the VP didnt like the song so he played Hotel California instead, which was way too long to hear in 3 minutes. So everybody figured he'd start it up where he left it off. Oh no, not commander dumb fuck, he played it from the begining until the same point every period. He ruined the song for me. I hope his Jaguar explodes tomorrow.
