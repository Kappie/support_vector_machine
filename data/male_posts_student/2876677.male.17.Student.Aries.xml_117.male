Everyone one wants to be able to "speak their mind" or "express themselves without fear of reprisal".  No ones thoughts are orignal.  People are just shallow mouthpieces as saying the same thing in different ways.  No one thinks of new ideas.  They just say what the "cool kids" say.  I should note that "cool kids" does not mean I am referring to teen in this post ANYWHERE.  This is about the global populus as a whole.  Everyone goes with the flow.  Even the "anti-flow" or those who "rage against the machine" are just another cog in the machine blindly stumbling down the highway to hell.  The truth is that individualism is a myth.  Someone somewhere does things just like you.  The more people there are, the less unique any one person is.  You may be a deviation from my system of belief but you are not original or alone in doing so.  Don't fool your self.  The belief in free will does not allude to original thought.  Have a nice day. Sincerely, Your fellow puppet
