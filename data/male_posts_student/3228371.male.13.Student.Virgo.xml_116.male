I can't emphasize on how much I love this guy. When I look into his eyes, they seem to captivate me and I just totally freeze. I get lost in his stare... His smile is so warm that it can warm me up during a cold winter day; and his voice... His voice is so comforting and assuring. Whenever I get so stressed out and I hear his voice, everything seems to be okay again even though nothing is. I feel so relaxed and just the mere prescence of him makes my heart skip a beat. :) Gee, I'm good at this stuff! Haha! But yeah... he's really special to me and stuff...   You kno wwho else is important and special to me? My best friend Erica. My buttcake! Always been there for me through break-ups, crushes, stress, homework, hyperness, everything! I love my buttcake~! ^^ Hehe! Through all this crap, we're still great friends and that's what makes this so special! Erica, if you're reading this, thank you so freakin much for always being there for me through all this shit and I really appreciate this! God has blessed me with a best friend that I have taken for granted so much... :) Ty for everything!  Of course, I can't forget Will! He's totally a big bro to me! I talked to him about my problems although it's not often and no, I don't want to create pressure for him, but he's also a great role model for me in my spiritual life with God. It's great and I love him as a spiritual brother. He's always been there to give me guidance when I needed it and I totally appreciate that too! He was there when I was with Wilfred, he was there when I liked Nima, and he's been there when I had my problems with Nima! Will if you're reading this too, THANK YOU! GOD BLESS YOU!  Alice... my sis! ^^ Oh my gosh! She is so cool! Hehe! I didn't know her that well but we've talked and yeah. She's sooo been there for me! I had my talks with her and everything and it's all cool. She's a cool person and everything and I appreciate all that she's done for me too! Thanks sis!!!  Big hugzZ~!  Next is INGIMON! Hahaha! A proud member of the Gummy Bear Trio! Muahahaha! You gotta be cool to be in the Gummy Bear Trio! Ingrid, Jay, and I are all cool people so we're in the Gummy Bear Trio! Ingrid and I have had our share of bitching about stuff and she's always been there for me to bitch about everything that's bugging me and she's done some bitching with me too! We've never bitched about each other though... which is good! We've both bitched about Wil, Nathan, [wastebucket], certain people, and yeah. Ingrid is cool! She's the Queen of the world and you have to give her cookies! Roofles! Of course, I met Chrissy through her and yeah. Thanks IngiEE~!  Oh, yes, I mentioned Jason too! He's a cool dude! Hehe! So cute! I mean that in the baby-cute way! Only Nima's guy-cute! ^^ So yeah... as I was saying... he's part of the Gummy Bear Trio! Cool guy! Hehe! Another big brother-ish person that I look up to! Haha! He's Ingimon's pokemon trainer and loooves pokable cheeks! Hilarious! Hehe! So yeah... thanks for being there Jay! Definitely made a difference in my life!  And then... there's Moca. Yes, Moca. We are the MOFU TOCA! Roofles! Yeah inside joke... anyway... STOP DROP AND ROLL! *cough* Inside joke again. LUPPER TIME! Yeah, another inside thing. Okay anyway... she's a great person once you get to know her. She's not all that snobby. To be honest, I used to think she was a big ego-ed snob when I first didn't know her that well but she's actually really cool. Good but blunt advice. Blunt isn't necessarily a bad thing though. Very straightforward and everything. Moca thanks for putting up with our Lupper sessions! TY~~~! *cough*Garurumon hugs*cough* *shudders at the thought*  There's one more person... CHRIS! Ahahaha! You weirdo! Haha! He's funny... He doesn't have my blog site but oh well. He's been through that girl (don't know her name), Becca, Jess, and now I think he's single again? I don't know... whatever. Only white guy on Friendster... haha! He's hilarious! IngiEE told me about the Shrek movie and I was ROFL! Actually it was Chris that made up ROOFLES! :P Cool guy. He's like a little brother I guess. Iunno not quite sure yet but yeah. Totally cool.  You know who's coolest though? Yeah, I was gonna say Nima but GOD is cool too! God is THE COOLEST! :) He rocks! Yup!  Nima's sexy though. I can't really call God sexy 'cos well, He's my God. But Nima's not my god... he's my alien... my boyfriend. :) I have a different love for Nima than for God. Very different. So yeah... I should go now... dinner and then Bethel... I'm out.   *mwahzZ*
