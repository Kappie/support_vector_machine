Maybe we bought the folding table and the plastic porch chairs, but that's, what, twenty dollars? I have two lamps from who-knows-where. My filing cabinet was thrown away by someone in the Science Department. I use a nightstand that I built in a summer camp woodworking course. I stole a second filing cabinet from my parents. A small cabinet was found in a little-used closet. My father helped me grab a bookshelf/entertainment center from a neighbor's garbage one Christmas; it covers one full wall of my bedroom. In turn, I helped him rescue a large, metal teacher's desk from the scrap heap. Until recently I had a set of video shelves thrown together with some old wooden boards and empty shoe boxes. And how could I forget the green table besides me, a twenty-five-year-old reject from an ill-fated shop class? (I made the trim out of a roll of packaging tape. Someone threw away the tape as well.)
