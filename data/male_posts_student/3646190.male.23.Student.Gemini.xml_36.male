That is something I will not allow for what part fate has left that power to me. This community is a place where my spiritual, emotional, and political needs have found home and I want it to grow.  -----  Yesterday was an amazing day. I hung out with a friend/ political comrade. (We can call her Hawra) Hawra is someone who I have been close to for the last two years. I have wept with her, laughed with her, and fought battles with her. She finally moved back to Detroit for the summer and we had dinner to celebrate the occassion. I am so lucky to have her in my life.  I sent this email to her after we had dinner:  I guess I just wanted to email you tell you how happy I was tonight. I loved hanging out with you and laughing together. It seems like it has been such a long time since we spent some time talking. I hope you did not get annoyed by my consistent remarks to LDD. To be honest it is an organization where I have found something I never thought I would--community based on politics, love, compassion, sadness, laughter, and a myriad of other human tribulations. I hope one day you and I can both share in that community, but that conversation is for another day.  Anyways, I missed you a lot this summer and I am so happy to see you again and to have you in the neighborhood. I know I have not said this enough, but you are just the BEST!!
