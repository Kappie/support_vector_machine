It's all blue and light black which is like country club sort of shit. This has made me soo mad as my friend too. Anyways i've played tennis again and I lost 6-3 7-6(1). My forehand is something I couldn't control which was nervewracking for me. Also the olympics starts in 29 days. I just can't wait! I have always had a passion for it and the events and the cities! Well not muc else to talk about bye
