We watched one the other night...the teacher was trying to get fired, and he had his gay sex slave in class.  I can't even remember what he was supposed to be exhibiting, but he used a clear tube to put a gerbil in the slave's arse!!  Then, they cut to an 'interior' shot of the gerbil beginning to explore....and then a soft wobbly voice, like in the original animated "the Hobbit", starts rhyming about the adventure!   OMG!!    Talk about Shock and Guffaw !  Throughout the show, they come back to the gerbil for a stanza or two.  At the end, he finally pops out of the slave's mouth and the show ends with a final, vibrato verse.   Stunning hilarity.  Stunning.
