And well, that isn't too good now. It is 140, I went to bed at 12 and I simply can not sleep. I tried watching TV, I got a drink, I had nothing on my mind at times, I had great thoughs other times. I even had the foolish idea to get my dog and try to fall asleep with him by me. And in my house everyone sleeps in a different room, even the dog. We are just a group of anti-socials. So I went into the extra bedroom, where my dog sleeps, and I called out his name a few times. But not to my suprise he didn't show himself. So I got down on the ground and reached under the bed, I know he is under the bed because I heard him scratching on my wall, and on my first attempt I lay my hand on a big ball of hair. It must have been his back or something, but it wouldn't have mattered if I touched his tail, head, back, or butt. He then let out this nasty sneeze/growl at me. And right then I knew I woke him up and he was pissed. But I wasn't too worried, he has all tomorrow to sleep. So then I went back into my room and got back in bed. I wasn't in bed for 10 seconds before I got the idea to come on the computer and report to this Blog Spot. This Blog Spot which is read by no one :). Eh, I don't care, I am writing this for something to do and for myself, while letting other people read if they choose.  LOL, up there instead of anti-socials I had anti-socialists. I meant people who were anti-social but I wanted to make it sound better. Good thing I caught that, anti-socialists are much different from anti-socials. For one, one of them may get shot showing their anti-whatever shirt around mid-Europe. And this year this whole thing went around how I was communist. It all happened when I bought this video game. Now in this game it had music that played, and I liked most of the songs that played. And there were only 20 or so, so I downloaded the ones that I liked. And one of the songs was Handful of Redemption by Boy Sets Fire. Months later I am in Coconuts looking to blow some money on a CD, what I do weekly. And I was looking at the artists names and I saw one name that stuck in my memory, Boy Sets Fire. So feeling happy and all that I remembered a name of a band that I heard of months ago; I bought the CD named Tomorrow Come Today. When I got home I turned on the CD on my computer to listen to the whole CD. Some of the songs were good, but others were horrific. So I saved the ones I liked on my computer and I looked at the Enhanced CD part of this Boy Sets Fire CD. All they had were live songs, so I listened. But inbetween two songs the singer said something like, "Next month on the White House lawn we are staging a protest against Bush." And they went on and on about Bush and his handling of Terrorism. And this got me thinking, this isn't your normal Fathers 70's protest band, these guys were more ratical. After watching the Enhanced CD I went online and searched for Boy Sets Fire. I found an interview done with them and I thought, "Great, now I will know what is up with this band." The results were unexpected. They were communists. One of them ordered the Communist Manifesto (A book about the Communist way) when he was a young teenager, 14 or so. Later that week I went to school with the CD and showed everyone what a fool I was, and how blind I was. Man was that a mistake. It was always a joke, always, but it stuck. Jimmy the Commie. It rhymed, a little bit. I even caught on calling myself a communist. And people went on and on and on. But finally it died down and the communist thing is only in the memories of the people who found it worth noting. They may have been communists but their music was great. Not too long ago I found out in Windows Media Player that I could see how many times I have played a song. So, curiously, I wanted to see what song I had played the most times. The results were unexpected. With 48 plays, Handful of Redemption by who else? Boy Sets Fire. This was a little suprise becasue when the whole 'Jimmy the Commie' thing started I stopped listening to the band. But, now, I figure it wasn't so weird. I have over 600 songs and to play one 48 times would be quite a job. But then again I got this one song 3 days ago and I have played it a whopping 40 times. But that may be because I have gotten a little tired of the 600 some songs I have.   Ha, look at the last few sentences. All I do is say one thing and contradict it with my next sentence. I guess I do that becasue in arguments I can't go wrong. Think about it, if I say, "Bush did a bad job with Terrorism" and then I say, "But who would have done a great job, no one could have predicted what would happen." I am covering both sides of the argument. It is weak because I am not focusing all my attention on one side of the argument but you can almost never go wrong. I have even done that in an argument with my dad and he noticed it and commended me on it.  Wow, it's 215. I have been writing this for 35 mintues. And, lol, I am missing the show I usually watch at 2 to write to my loyal fans. That show is Spin City, with Michael J. Fox. This was before Mike coudln't continue the show and Charlie Sheen took over. I really like some of the older shows. I will always watch a rerun of Seinfeld. Infomercials are cool too. You set it and forget it! And my new favorite one, You can't clean the air if you don't move the air. That is classic. Said by a man who looked healthy, but he gave you the sence that he could fall down any moment. I have babbled on long enough. And I feel a little tired!!! Ahhhh I have to get up in 6 hours and 20 minutes. And if you actually are reading this you know that I said that I wouldn't be counting down. What can I say? It's the Yankees. Have faith in the great DiMaggio my son. It was something I said. Ahhh I will go on and on if I don't stop myself right here. Okay, I am done, finally. Goodnight/morning depending where you are in the world. I should probably stop tring to be funny because I haven't made anyone laugh in months. Oh well, sometimes you lose it if you don't use it.
