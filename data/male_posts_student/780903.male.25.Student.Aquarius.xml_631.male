This is my attempt to recruit.  They're looking; I said I'd help.  If you're a Harvard 1L without any interesting in writing a column for The Record but read this anyway, I'd also be delighted if you e-mailed just to say hi.  But you don't have to.  I'll never know.  I am pretty nice about sharing my old outlines though.  (This is what happens when I go six hours without any new e-mails... I think I'm just bored.)
