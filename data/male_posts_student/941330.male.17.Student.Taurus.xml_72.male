EVAR. at 8 pm invertigo closed, this really cool guy told us to wait a little bit for alex's phone...maybe half an hour...eh, you can go sleep. we wanted to jump the fence and get the phone but he said terrible things happen, you get the police, the media, you're sent to jail, sentenced, just cuz of a phone. but alex got it in the end.  fourth of july...went to the parade at warm springs. hella people for its 3rd year, no celebrities tho. not even Kristi yamiguchi...shucks. saw our band, rigo chacon (abc7 news! he had a mic and everything), some Scottish people swordfighting in kilts, and some pirate lady going: "can I buy that thar child from ya? two bits, or one?" then I went to the nhs car wash. there was one squeegee. what kind of travesty is that, a carwash with one squeegee. it's like...a house with one tv. or something. the lazy juniors let some guy wash his own car. yeaa rita! but I ain't trippin. we made over $200 total, not so bad. tam was thinking of doing paintball for a fundraiser later...that's...unheard of! Joanna was going around, "do you want to donate to support breast cancer?" and you wonder why people didn't donate, besides, guys dont relate to breast cancer silly...lol then jack London square that night, we passed by Melissa Shinto! she was on the phone though. off went the fireworks. some annoying AS HELL kids were going ooh! wow!! after every firework, even the crappy ones. smiley face! flower!...I wanted to throw them into the bay. the end was crazy, they set off 20 fireworks at the same time for half a minute. san Francisco, eat your heart out...alex: "well I was at great America so fuck YOU!"  yesterday ate at del taco (where arby's used to be) and used three coupons. for one meal! only my dad...then terminator 3. it was good, it all made sense. lots of random carnage, which is definitely helpful. "talk to the hand!" funny stuff. the naked chick: not too bad...naked ahhnold: ahh my eyes my eyes my eyes
