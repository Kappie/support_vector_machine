Probably, but I may do it anyway. At some point. Not now. Another time.  This morning was as dull as ever. Learnt my German Oral presentation in about 20 minutes, but I still have to look at some of those practice questions and 'think' of some answers to them. But why should I do that when I know that the only other person to do so will be megatrobe, and the teacher won't be able to prove if we've done it anyway. I may do it a little, spend about 15 minutes on it. Later. The same with English homework, which Mr 'Opf boyyys' Herbert set last lesson. Just to do a sheet I think, but I know that if I do it I will be the only one who has, and I mean the only one. Not even dickybod or deutsches will. I may do it though because I really could do with the revision. But thinking about that, I have all the notes for the poems anyway, and as I have the notes in the antology book during the exam, there's not a great deal of point revising. Again, I may do a little. Later.   Oh, I finished that chemistry test this afternoon (about 20 minutes ago), wasn't too hard. I'm feeling fairly confident about chemistry, but a shame I can't say the same about biology. That test was hard. Meh, I'll do a bit more revision. Later. :) In other news, I have been practicing my juggling skills over this weekend, and I'm quite impressed with myself. I can juggle 3 clubs for about 2 minutes, and the same with 3 rings (about the size of... *gets ruler out* 20 cm across). I can do 3 small balls for significantly longer. It's great fun, I would recomend anyone take it up as a hobbey... wait! Is juggling a hobbey...? If it is.. wooooo! yay! I have a hobbey! It's not is it...? No. Oh well, I still need a proper hobbey, but juggling! What fun. I generally listen to my music on the computer and try to juggle in time to it, which can get tricky, especially with the fast 'element song' or 'nations of the world'. anyway, my most recent attempt it to juggle 3 balls whilst spinning around on my computer chair, which is fairly hard, but you soon get used to it, if you go slowly at first. So everyone, go and start juggling! So much fun. And I'm the only person (other than my 2 sisters, whom I TAUGHT) who can juggle 3 balls properly. It's a great feeling knowing that. Anyway, that's what I've been doing this weekend, other than revising, homework, eating and sleeping. (If you leave out the comma between homework and eating, it looks like 'homework eating', which is probably not the best idea) 'Opf, David, whyyy are you eating the homework I set you, yeh? We reallyyyy haven't got time for this'.  Anything else to say? Can't really think of anything. Oh well, bye for now.   Playing:  Nothing  Listening to:  Some Disney songs I copied to my computer from a CD, some are actually quite good. 'Prince Ali' in German probably the best :)  Watching:  Nothing today actually  Annoyed with:  Not being able to eat homework  Confused about:  Juggling in circles  Mood:  Nearly happy (but not quite)
