Oh, and yesterday also heralded the best Kung Fu lesson I can remember.  Life is sweet, apart from my fear that the better life gets the further it has to fall... but I won't think about that.  Even better, the guy I'm working for has a thing for Jaffa cakes, and his wife makes great tuna sandwiches... so I'm never short of a bite to eat either.  Bad things - well I suppose part of my job involves calling people from a list and asking if they would be interested in our services.  I can't remember the technical name for it, but fortunately I am not working for a double glazing salesman, and the list of people to call is quite specialised, so I get a positive response on about 1/2 the people I call; still the other half's responses aren't always pleasant.  Next time a double glazing salesman calls, think twice about telling him that 'I doubt I've got the same number as somebody else' (NONONO what I meant was that his number was listed twice) or alternatively spelling out your whole address in the phonetic alphabet (alpha bravo charlie etc) just because he didn't hear it the first time.  Then again, they  are  double glazing salesmen aren't they... use your judgement.
