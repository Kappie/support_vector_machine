For those who arent initiated into the world of nerdom, Xaos is a store over by In-N-Out that specializes in the sale of Card and Role-Playing games. Ive been more or less a regular fixture there for more five years now, but recently I havent been able to get out as much as id like. (Damn AP bullshit..... i shouldnt be studying... im too young for this shit.) Any way, for anyone interested in getting into the nerd community, I hardily endorse this sevice and/or product. Good people, fun times, and a whole lot of random shit.    So, I asked Carol Ralls to go to Prom with me as a friend. This is the third time ive tried to find a date for this thing, and if she cant go I going to officaily give up and go and cry in a corner. Hopefully her parents wil be cool (hell, for that matter, hopefully my parents will be cool), and well be able to go. It should be fun, going in a limo with Rolandandliane, and Roumie my Homie. Good times will be had by all.    Random thought for the day: Do I look like Quentin Tarantino? While i was hanging out at the store last night some new guy who was a friend of another one of the regulars told me that I look like him. This isnt the first time ive heard this, but I just dont have a clue if its a truthful or accurate statement. What does everyone think?
