At least I have a life beyond my computer with volleyball (no offeance Amy, Andy, Kelsea, et al).  I saw Deanna too...  In a song the Barenaked Ladies say, "When you die they make a list/Of every girl you never kissed." The song is about regreting the act of doing nothing. I regret not kissing about three, maybe four, girls I have ever met. I regret a lot of things, but these regrets haunt me the most.
