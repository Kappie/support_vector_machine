D eftones  O asis  U sed  G reen day  give it a shot.   it's pretty late but i think a mini-me of a post is in order. today was weird to comment mildly. some more unneeded hassle which i have become all too familiar with. i don't want to really go into detail just yet, so let's not dwell. today was the senior awards ceremony at bhs and since my girl was getting a bunch of honors, i felt the need to show my support. i didn't mind going, but holy christ that ceremony was longgg... the auditorium was real hot and dr. hines voice is definitely not a songbird's. (atticus finch would shoot her if he had the chance.) amber looked real cute when she hugged ms. dean on stage, i was proud to see the oogles of awards my smart girlfriend got too. the whole event was nice and humbling however. hell, i'll be up there in the not so far future. isn't that crazy?  sleep tight kids...
