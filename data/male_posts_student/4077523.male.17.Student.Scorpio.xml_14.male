He basically said that struggle is delayed obedience. And I agree to that. In most cases struggle is caused because we tend to not obey God and try to do it ourselves. Anywho, I just thought I would say that because it really stuck out to me.       I can't wait until Friday. Jessica, Ashley, Justin, and I will go to Geyser Falls (a water park) and hopefully it wont rain and we will have fun. If you could, pray for it not to rain in that area because I know it is supposed to rain there tomorrow, hopefully it wont continue through Friday.      Well, i'm gonna go and post later, like tomorrow or something. -Fly with Christ.
