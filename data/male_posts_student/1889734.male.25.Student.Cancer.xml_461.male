I am not ashamed to admit that I worship the ground George Will walks on. He has succinctly put the fundamental trurh of conservatism in one sentance:  Conservatives say inequalities of outcomes are manifestations of freedom and prerequisites for progress.   Embrace the idea that some will not have the happy outcomes of others, no matter what money is thrown at them. Donald Trump is rich because of his own actions. A crack ho is destitute and doomed because of her own actions. While I do not aspire to greatness, I do know what it is and where it comes from. No one can be handed success. It must be earned, and the pryrimidal structure of achievement in society compels those who would climb it to strive against one another.   What Leftists seek is to crush the spirit of competition in the name of fairness and security. This is otherwise known as Communism. If there is no apex, no pyrimid to ascend, why would we ever strive to be more than we are? Why improve yourself and take risk when there is no payoff? Ronald Reagan called the USA a shining city on a hill. We still are, but for how long? Note the language used: on a hill. That means we are above the rest; elevated above the others.   I hope we do not forsake that which made us great. Things like freedom and liberty. An ethos that rewards and idolizes those who succeed. Americans love a winner, but it seems we now want everyone to think they are winners. This has the paradoxial effect of manking the true winner a loser like the rest.  If we hand over the freedom to succeed or fail in exchange for the straight-jacket of security, then we truly have forsaken what this country was founded to be. George Bush is offering it to us. So are his Democratic rivals. The nanny-state cometh, and I fear it is inescapable. I'm sorry I can't offer any hope for the world, as it seems we no longer care about hope, only our base needs.   This is why Space is so important. Though we fall into the darkness the rest of the world embraces, we can at least pave the way for an escape for the future generations. Space, and other worlds may ultimately be that avenue of freedom. One day there will be another generation with the greatness of our Founding Fathers. They will need some place to go to escape the oppression of the Old World. But now that oppresssion seeks to deny them that in advance. We would sell the future for some breat in the present. The Children and the Old need our money more!   No, they don't. The old have their own money, earned through a lifetime of labor. If they do not, they failed. Plain and simple. The fact that old age comes to us all is well-known. So the duty to prepare is also incumbent on everyone. It is not incumbent on the young to labor in support of the old. Children have thier parents. They do not need the State to pay for their education! Why should those who do not have offspring pay for priveledges for those who do? Again, that is called slavery. These two groups do not need the State to take care of them. They can take care of themselves, or have their relatives do the job for them.  In closing, I must reiterate my reverence and awe for what the Founders did. They threw off the shackles of prior thought, and oppression to found what is the most perfect nation that has ever existed. ut we are not perfect, so the state cannot endure. It has been steadily eroded and mutated almost beyond recognition. The only way to turn back lies not in elections or legislation, but in our hearts. Know yourself, and know that you are your own master. You have no right to compel labor or sacrifice of others! Own your own actions and ask the same of others! Do not trade freedom for the dubious offer of security. That way lies slavery.
