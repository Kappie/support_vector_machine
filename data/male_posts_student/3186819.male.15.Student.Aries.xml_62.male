Well, of course, I saw Farenheit 9/11 on the 25th, so here we go from then.  I had a pretty quiet weekend. A doctor's appointment, but other than that. I am being taken off my medication! Yeyness-esk! Then there was an Election on the Monday. My beloved Liberal's won! I didn't do anything on the 29th. Except Michael came forth with an idea to revamp the Hamilton Student Union. Thats all I can say, due to a nda...Then on the 30th.....Don't even get me started. On the night of the 29th (oh, Michael came over with his broken computer, so I fixed it), Tanya and I were discussing what the 3 of us should do on the 30th. Somehow, Wild Water Works became an idea. So when the 30th came around, I thought it would be a good idea to have my ticket anyways, just incase we were going to go. So I bought my ticket at Shopper's just before going downtown. This was seen as presumptious, but I was prepared at least. Even after saying we didn't have to go that day (repeatedly saying that) we did end up going. Michael didn't swim. Then the 3 of us had dinner at La Spaghett. Best food I have ever eaten! And that pretty much summed up June. Canada Day rolled around, and we planned to do a lot of work on the HWSU. Unfortunately, my family duties called, so Tanya and Michael got stuck with all the work. I do feel very much so like a "rubber-stamp President" but what can you do! On Canada Day, we priced a boatload of stuff for garage sale, I planted the grapes and strawberries, and then made dinner. I made steak and chicken (my mom eats only chicken and occasionally turkey/fish), baked potatoes, and my sister made some corn-on-the-cob. It was a good meal (but it's no La Spaghett). Then after the dishes were washed, we went over to a field and set off fireworks! It was the first time we had ever set of fireworks, but it was very fun! Then we came home and I went to bed a few hours after. And now today I am writing this post and excitedly (but impatientely) waiting for the 24th, when I fly to Winnipeg. Let us hope that time flys!   UBER THANK YOU TO TANYA AND MICHAEL FOR ALL OF THEIR HARD WORK YESTERDAY. THANKS SO MUCH!   With Love, Bobert
