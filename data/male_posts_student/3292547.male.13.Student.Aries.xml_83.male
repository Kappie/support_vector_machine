The whole purpose was because most of the people on  urlLink Neowin.net  were using it in a team and not Tiny KeyCounter. So, leaving my 330K key count behind, I start over again with a new program. All the more reason to try and type as much as I can. A few days from now I'll forget it, but then I'll pick it back up again when I notice the picture in my post. For my current count, you can look to the picture below, which should update every time I "Pulse".  Anyway, I'll leave you alone now. I still should be folding towels, but decided to post this little peice of imformation before I left. See ya!   urlLink     Note: My username is  NeoTech , though it isn't shown above so I could make it smaller.
