Took all afternoon, but now only a few things are missing.   Received 6 invites for  gmail , gave 1 to  Helder  and 1 to  Justin . They were both happy about it. Also i'm trying a complete transition over Gmail and just drop  hotmail  if possible. It is said on Gmail that it will become a  pop3  soon.   Also, after the satisfaction provided by  Mozilla's Firefox , i decided to install  Thunder Bird , their E-mail pop3 client. I have yet to experience it, as soon as gmail turns pop, it will be done.   Well, tomorrow is maths test, hell in a can.   I'm tired so good night to the few souls who read this.  Regards,  Zephyr
