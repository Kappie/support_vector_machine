Anyhoo i decided to march on writing and updating my blogs cos at one day i can look back at my so far boring , yet incident packed life..          Firstly I would like to write about all those thing that i promised that i would write in this blog as of yesterday... Well all thru the last one and a half terms of last year i found myself in a sort of precarious situation .... i find that i recieved a very ICE COLD reception into my new class ... something that i was unusd to because i normally get along with my friends with minor ups and downs every now and then....i find one day that nobody really wants me in the new class.  Ok iam going down history lane and hece if Aj or anybody is hurt after reading the following,i am sorry..i am only doing my job of writing my blog...I am your friend for life  Ok moving away from myself, Arvind Jayshankar,,,,"Dearest of all my friends" turns his back on me...the reason simple...he is/was and always will be a grade A ass licker....So i decided once it was holidays time to have some fun and decided to get involved in class politics for the first time in a year.....and boy oh boy was it fun.... I made new friends actually in the process..in the form of Hareesh Krishnan And Rohit....Then I Went on unleashing the beast within me to find out where i went so badly wrong so that i could rectify myself...but the funniest part is that as of date i dont get as to why a few people (whose names(s) i dont wanna mention becos they have some intergrity) turned their backs on me...???         Anyways Past is Past And i followed my policy of forget and never remember....Then the funniest event during the holidays....AJ's so called treat.........Oh God! If You Exist Please Give Arvind J Some Sense.....For He Took 12 Others To A Hotel Fit Only For Food Poisoning....Going TO The Mattar...Actually A Friend Of Ours Called Arving Jayshankar    (AJ for short and not because he looks or sings like the Aj in the backstreet boys...hmmm i can also assure you that a donkey will make better noise when it shits rathar than aj singing...i promise you ,u dont wanna hear him sing)   is in love with a girl named Gowri Manohari....And For the stats she happens to be the second person that Aj is loving...his first girl friend ,sharnya krishnan apparnatly dumped him or he dumped her ... what ever way u like to have it .... So aj has actually proposed to Gowri and if any of u girls from e1 are reading this aj told he proposed to her because the girls in e1 will not take things seriouly if boys propose to them......So Aj wanted some high class flirting time and hence has had the balls to ask her out on a date to Taj Coramandel....But Gowri had other ideas and told aj that she would call her friends...and although aj would have liked it if he were the only male party in the treat he called upon some 8 fellows for company to eat the worst food that they have ever tasted all their lives...so i decided to ruin his party becos for all that i get for being his closest friend for 2.5 years wan a "DONT EVEN THINK OF COMING INVITATION" ...so i went there to Hotel Sudha with a few of my friends and i think that i will leave the issue there.........  Nextly The Id Hacking Contreversy........OK I TRIED TO HACK ARVIND J'S EMAIL ID BUT PEOPLE PEOPLE   WHY THE HELL WOULD I NEED TO HACK GAYATHRI SHIVAJI'S EMAIL ID........I DONT UNDERSTAND Then Nagini ,Gs(Short for Gayathri Shivaji),Uthra-who happens to be my std.10 class mate , Aj,myself,hareeesh krishnan and rohit were codially invited to watch 2 very close friends in the name of hareesh and aj tear the life out of each other at adayar bakary....the feud infact got so violent that we were asked to vacate the place at once and hey, the fight did not end there these 2 fools took it even to the road....But from a personal point of view,without any favouritism i would like to say that Aj has hacked Gs's id.....but i still dont understand what i had to do in all this mess? if someone knows the answer please tell me.. That about wraps up some of the non sense that happened in the holidays and as always ..alls well that ends well and i am friendly with every one including aj now not cos i really wanna be friends but i want to make the last year of my schoolong a memorable on efor all the right reasons       Then      ON A day called TODAY...........            Well today was an exciting day esp. towards the eveing as the school had reopen for all the other classes...we being in the 12 th standard did the traditional job of vote begging as we carried on the glorious PSBB tradition of requesting,pleading and even at times crying to our 9-10-11 th junours to vote for us Anyways our male candidate is ramkumar whose blogs are losing popularity day in day out and i think that he has a fantastic chance of winning and stealing the limelite..... W e are in a very confident and a sort of defiant mood and are sure to be victorous but one can never say after all the BJP led NDA got a royal kick in the ass as ramani would say,did'nt it  So i think that thats all that i can put in for the day and see ya on the morrow Hello People....Time To Say Good Bye
