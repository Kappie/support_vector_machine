We walked around her neighborhood  for a while and then when we were towards the back we saw cows over the fence. We were like WTF is that?!?! At first I thought it was a horse but then when we got closer and I saw it was a cow lol. I didn't know that cows could live in the woods. When we were in her house we tried to do the Bloody Mary thing in the bathroom....I wonder if all four of us going in the bathroom looked wrong...anyway we were staring at the mirror in the dark and it was dead silent until WHAM!!!! Stacey's dad banged on the door and it scared the crap out of everyone lol. Then we listened to Lynard Skynard and looked at pictures. At 12:15 we went outside to wait for my mom to pick me up because my aunt, uncle, and cousin are down from NJ. We just sat on the bench and when they came I was really sad because that was probably the last time I was gonna see Stacey for a while. So I gave her a hug and kiss goodbye and went on my way. For some reason Deidra keeps on calling the two of us "Grandma and Grandpa".....whatever lol. Then I went out to lunch with the folks and we went to the pool. After dinner my uncle, cousin and I all went mini golfing lol. My lil cousin won, my uncle came in 2nd and of course I lost. We got outa there at about 11:00 and then we went to Hooters for dessert lmao. That was the first time my cousin who is 10 had been there. My uncle was like wow, I was like omg and Justin was like wtf? *sigh* good times. Now I just got back from the pool and I am stuffing my face with CHEEZ-ITs lol.
