We harassed pedestrians from the van while driving through New Paltz, and there was this one fairly hot chick hogging the road with her bicycle, so we slow down next to her and John yells jokingly "THERE IS A SIDEWALK, YA KNOW"...as we're driving away, she lets go of the handlebars to blow John a kiss and by doing so loses control of the bike.....so the bike tips over and she goes flying off the bike right onto the sidewalk! We died laughing, it was the most hysterical thing to see a hot chick fall off a bike. I guess we're all going to hell now.  -BIGsmut
