Outside the baseball stadium stood an approximate amount of 300 pro-Palestine protestors stomping on Israeli flags, spitting (THEY ACTUALLY DID IN THE BEGINNING, TOWARDS THE PEOPLE COMING) on the people attending the event, and shouting curses at the people.  It's okay to protest, that's one thing. Then it's one thing to protest during another nation's holiday. But it's absolutely wrong to act that way in front of another country. That is just inhumane.  Spitting, acting violent, yelling and burning flags is disrespectful and simply uncool. It's just morally wrong. Especially in the USA.  Fuckers.  Purely inhumane.  Then I met Ari, Lucy and Simone... And Ari and I wanted to throw shit at them, but Simone thought that throwing Hershey's Kisses at them was wrong, but she said that swearing at them was okay.  I am pissed off.   If I were a Palestinian (tfu tfu tfu), I am sure that I could not have picked a better location, and I would be happy that my protesting worked and pissed people off, but because I was one of the people who the protest was directed at, I have no choice but to be pissed off and angry. Woah, big run-on...  I am angry.  It just gave me more reasons to hate Palestine... As if my current reasons aren't enough.  If it took being violent to make the protestors shut up, I'd have hurt them all. Each and everyone of them. Muslim, Christian, and even Jew (there were Anti-Zionist Jews protesting with them...).  I would have thrown stuff at them, even if I got arrested for it.  I was so tempted to hurt them, it was unbelivable. Just seeing the Palestinian flag makes me wanna punch someone.  I hate them. I fucking hate them. All of them. Even the non-radical ones. Just because you're not willing to die to show your hate of a country doesn't mean you don't hate them and want them dead.  This protest made me want to join the Israeli army, as I had doubts about that. I want to be drafted and fight in Palestine, against Palestinians.   I am almost 14, and I will hate Palestine until the day that I die.  If I ever become a millionare, I hereby  swear  that half of the money I make will go to aiding the State of Israel.  Back to the protest, I think some people were kidding when they said: "Let's cuss them out!" or "Let's throw shit at them!" but I was serious. I had a plan to steal the microphone, run with it to the bathroom, and from a bathroom stall yell anti-Palestine chants.  Fuck them all.  Fuck the radicals, the non-radicals, the Anti-Zionists, the Nazis, the Skinheads, the KKK, CNN, Al-Jazeera, the Palestinians, the Arabs, the Muslims, and most of all... The misinformed ones.  FUCK THEM ALL!!  May you die you fucking sons of bitches.  My heart is with Israel forever!!  ~1~    P.S. I bought an awesome shirt that says: "Pro-Israel... Pro-Peace" and there is a flag of Israel with peace signs on it. I bought it to support the greatest country on earth, and I shall wear it proudly tomorrow.
