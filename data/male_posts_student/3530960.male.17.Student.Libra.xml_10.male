It's gonna go towards trips and stuff for the rest of the year.  I'm working at Panera from 4:30-10:00 tonight. Saturday nights usually aren't that busy, so it shouldn't be that bad. I could use the money.  I just got a nice licence plate frame for my car that has flames shooting out of it at Pep Boys. Now all I need to get is a nice subwoffer and my car will be all set.  Alright, I really should go and get changed now. Later.
