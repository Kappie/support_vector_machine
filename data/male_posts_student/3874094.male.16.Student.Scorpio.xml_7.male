Anyway, relieved that i FINALLY received my reprint of the school's leaving cert...oh  yessss ....Was kinda amused to see the Big P of the school going around wearing a blue cap, grinning away and asking students how they liked his er..hat. Hey its always better to have a loony principal than some dry old fart.   And todaay? Today was the best day i have ever had for mytimetable, classes ended at 12! Oh yea, blissful relaxation all the waaay....turned down george's invitation to go catch Brotherhood..was feeling lazy...had lunch in canteen 3 with me big sis and some of the guys from class. Hah, Ericia and her friend thought my sis was my gf! Dang, does she look THAT young....nah i think its because she's rather shoooort...wahahahahahaha  Kinda wasted my whole afternoon, played warcraft3, then went on to a few rounds of cs...god have i lost touch of that game...i was seriously a free frag for the bots during the first few matches. Oh yea, blasted the whole house with my Sprite Hip Hop compilation, finally got to make full use of me 5.1 speaker system, bass absolutely rocks! Spent about an hour bobbing to the music of Obie Trice while tacking my newly bought posters..goodness, three posters for 24 freakin bucks!! Oh well.... guess nothing really significant left to say..post ends here i guess, really gotta go practice violin...seriously screwing up every sat...god help me....  Later people
