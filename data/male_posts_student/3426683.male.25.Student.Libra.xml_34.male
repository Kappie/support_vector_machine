"On the other side, we have Nomar Garciaparra, who sulked in the Red Sox dugout for the entirety of last night's game. Either he's getting traded, or he's determined to turn the city against him. Boston is a weird place. If everyone is standing at the top step of the dugout, and you're sitting awkwardly on the bench with a 'I wish this game would end, I could go for some pizza' face, you may as well just start strangling kittens on live TV at that point. I'm not a betting man -- okay, that's a complete lie -- but unless Nomar gets traded in the next 48 hours, I would bet that last night's game became one of his defining moments in Boston. And not in a good way."  Maybe he's right.  I don't know.  But on some level, I can't help but think that Simmons' ending is apocalyptic on the level of some of Dan Shaughnessy's columns.  It feels a bit piled on, to be honest.  I don't know if I blame Nomar for being a bit prickly.
