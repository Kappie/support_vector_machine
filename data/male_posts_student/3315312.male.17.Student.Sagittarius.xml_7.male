We oppose that and any other attempt to rig the electoral process...Nor should the intelligence community be made the scapegoat for political misjudgments. A Republican administration working with the Congress will respect the needs and quiet sacrifices of these public servants as it strengthens America's intelligence and counter-intelligence capabilities and reorients them toward the dangers of the future."-  urlLink The Republican Platform during the 2000 election
