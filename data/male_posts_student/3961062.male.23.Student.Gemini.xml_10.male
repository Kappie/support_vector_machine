Looks like fun, and two friends' respective blogs have also exacted influence. Hats off to Mitch Harden ( urlLink http://discord.us/blog/ ) and Megan Elder( urlLink http://thesojourner.blogspot.com ) for this unintentional accomplishment! I suppose it's not much of an accomplishment unless I post really cool stuff though. Forthcoming, I hope.   My sleepless night was due to several things: jet lag thanks to a 15 hour return flight from China on Friday, 14 hours of sleep Friday night and Saturday morning (and1 hour of the afternoon), and my racing mind. Soon I will get ready to go to church by eating waffles (I hope) and getting dressed. Until then I am going to explore more blogger features such as profiles and what-not. Expect lots of stuff from meabout movies, Christianity, politics, and of course the mundane aspects of my life in Evansville. I apologize for my lack of sentence flow andcombination; hopefully that will improve with more sleep and better health!
