Well, at least 5x cooler. I'll be getting some comments running in a little bit and everything will be fine.   I think.   I plan to do with this blog, what many others might have done had I been paying attention, but basically post about computers and technology and crap. Maybe life just a little bit of the time. But, lets not let life take control of you before you take control of it, right?   So to start off with my plan... (I should use less "dot, dot, dots" and more "dots") Google is introducing  urlLink G-mail . Should be interesting and I will definitely check it out because my hotmail account if 87% full 70% of the time and stuff google makes is cool anyways - 1GB. Who cares about a few text ads. (I guess these people do)   Have you ever been to  urlLink musicplamsa.com ? This crazy music artist search engine displays results in a spider web format with your artist in the center and related ones close to it. It has a little disagreeable and some short clips. plus the ability to zoom in and out. Definitely cool.   Speaking of cool search engines, check out  urlLink kart00.com . Its flash based.   So this last weekend, which is the one the happended before this week, I made a new user profile in windows xp. Why you may ask? wait you didn't ask anything. Why?-you may ask: Because my other profile was screwed up really bad and wouldn't display pdfs and windows media player. So now everything is fine again and I promise to make a log off all installations, errors, malicious code, viruses, and other bad things, all in one file called index.html. Yes, that's right, this file. Because i thought a plain word file on my desktop would be too boring. SOW....   Today I installed dBpowerAMP wma to mp3 converter. Because I needed to covert my previously converted files back to mp3 so that they can play on my new mp3 cd player.   Put a dash between crazy and joe? No of course not.  urlLink (homestarrunner.com)    So until the next thing...
