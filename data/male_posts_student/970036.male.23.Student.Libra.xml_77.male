Nicole and I have managed to stumble upon an attractive suite in Renaissance Place.  Yes, ... urlLink that  Renaissance Place.  I used to think it was quaint that we were moving into a building where a man I knew of, Gary Prime, was brutally murdered in his own suite by  hatchet wielding maniacs . When we first checked out the building, I even joked that, "If we're shown a suite at the end of the hall, we're  not  taking it!"  But now, with yet another brutal murder in the same upscale building in the past 3 years, we're living in one of the deadliest buildings in Edmonton - which makes our new place  even better ! I can picture great Hallowe'en parties already...   Currently: Packing a few items for our weekend getaway.
