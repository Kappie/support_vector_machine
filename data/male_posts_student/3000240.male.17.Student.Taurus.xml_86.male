However it doesn't mean that I give less of a toss about her than say what identical twin sisters would about each other. So, tonight at 10, with me and my Mum minding our own business watching CSI (a rarity considering I hate CSI and "TV with Mother activities")I hear that she had collapsed from a rather sordid night of, from what I'm told "alcoholic blood transfusion" I got quite concerned for  the old lump .  Ahh well, after much transparent activity, me and Mother decided that Morden accident and emergency was far too much of a distance to reasonably give a 2nd thought about, as we had came to the conclusion that: 1. She shouldn't be drinking at that age 2. The police cell was a far more viable alternative for her.  Anyway been a boring weekend so far, apart from I met someone new who I like sort of, and I might ask her out sometime soon I guess. Well I hope I get the courage anyway. Ciao. xBuBzx
