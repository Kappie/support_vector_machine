One thought to begin with, I just watched Simple Life with Paris Hilton and I just have to ask in anyone realy amazed that people around the world think that Americans are stupid. For legal reasons I would like to point out that I dont think that Americans are stupid I just understand why one would think so. Anyway Paris Hilton is the daughter of one of the ritchest guys living and one would guess that he could afford decent education apperantly not. Miss Hilton didnt know what a well was or what you did do with it. She didnt have a clue what wal-mart was, not even it was a mall or a store.  About my week, I have been sick most of it and just spent my time watching downloaded movies (loved Bloody Sunday (shame in Brits) and Average Joe) and slept, not very interesting. On Friday I reconed that I was regaining my health so i went to a science trip with my school to IMG Gallup whitch wasnt the best one coz' the guy who was introducing the company did talk for over an hour and in the end over half the people had left, including me. The Students then chatted for something like an hour while drinking free beer (the only reason we came). Afterwards  we went to, I guess, the hottest bar in the city Herfisbarinn (could be translated as the Local). Where we got more free beer and everybody were on track to get wasted (Icelandic style;). Me and Svana did have serious chat about Adams hair, not realy but we talked quite a bit about our experience and other stuff then everybody went to the dancefloor. About an hour later (around 2-3) I called one of my friend, who had gone to see other friends, but he was home, another friend was barely alive, for to much alcahol, since he was with his girlfriend I decided to leave and went to other bars but with little success, so I called a friend who had offered to pick me up we went to eat some drunk food which is so much better than BCN. Tim when you come here Ill introduce you to BSI´s pizzasandwich, just classic.   The morning after me parents left for Italy where they are on a skiing trip but I still spent most of my time watching football and didnt realy do anything thing until 1:30 in the morning when I went to pick up my drunk friend and then another and finally somegirls asked me if I could drive them home which I did.  At 5 I came home and went to sleep and just woke up at 13 to see "boltinn með Guðna Bergs" which is the best program in Iceland and its about football:) after that I watched Chelsea win Blackburn in fun game and went to work. When I came I just felt sick and have had a headace al the shift, since Im off in like 20 minutes and i think I just might watch Super Bowl not that I like anythin' about it just dont think Ill fall a sleep.  Next week will be difficult coz' we've got 7 projects to hand in, that most definatly means that Ill have to get drunk on Friday but man's got to do what man's got to do.  Úlli
