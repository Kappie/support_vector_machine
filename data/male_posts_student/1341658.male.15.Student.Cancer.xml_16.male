This site is free and you are the ones who have to look at it so if you really wanted to, could pay to get rid of the ads.  But, what am I talking about...   "you" most of the time ends up being me and as you can see, I generate about 75% of all my hits, Not Google.  And that should change sometime.  And I hope I get some g-mail invites because that would rock considering they are worth anywhere from $30 - $50.  Or  urlLink even more !  So get the  urlLink google toolbar , or else...  really popped is the correct word for the title.
