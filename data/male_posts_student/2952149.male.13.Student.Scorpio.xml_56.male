Then I said "Who are you callin boy?!" Then Krystal and Marcel were arguing and I said to Krystal "You're white, it's alright." But Marcel didn't pick up on it. *sigh*. Then at lunch Thomas was like "FUCKIN NIGGERS!" We both turned beet red because he said it so loud...omg lol. Then in 6th we had a pizza party thingo and me and Tim P. were saying spic a lot little did we know there was a whole table of them behind us lol. Then they were giving us dirty looks. We also made Klan hats out of our napkins and put them on the Sprite cans lmao. Well, now I am talking to Stacey on the phone...bye.
