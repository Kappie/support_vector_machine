It had a plotline which parallel's Baldur's Gate 2.  Allow me to elaborate. In BG2, you play a humble adventurer who is just realizing you are something a bit... grander.  Same with Bruce Willis in Unbreakable.  He is a plain old security guard that survives a deadly train wreck.  That event could be paralleled by being the "Hero of Baldur's Gate" by killing Sarevok.  Then you are confronted by an evil mage Irenicus who uses you to find out who he is (or just become immortal, whatever).  Like Sammy Jackson in Unbr.(eakable), both are evil, frail, and geniuses.  Both also murdered masses to get to you (Bruce Willis).  Over time, and with the fragments of Irenicus's knowlege (Jackson), you realize you are more than just a petty adventurer (security guard).  You are a hero!  You rescue Imoen in BG2 (the family in the movie) and also learn from flashbacks and dreams who you really are (in the movie, Willis flashes back to college when he survived a car wreck).  You finally can get to your enemy (Jackson) who says they needed you to find/help themselves.  You kill him (Jackson goes to jail). That plotline compares Willis to you, the Hero.  Now here's the fun part!  Both have themes!  Is it right to murder mass amounts of people for things to be the way they should be?  For you to find youself? What if it is in the name of "good"? Is it a hollow existence?  This question is brought up many times in Baldur's Gate 2:Throne of Bhaal and at the end of the movie.  It really isn't justified.  As an adventurer, you either fade into mediocrity ("good") or become a Lord of Murder ("evil" or as in the movie, Jackson could've been an insane super-villain).  Both are not anyone's desired fate.  Comparable to the game, Jackson fades into mediocrity (jail) for his mass murderings, but realizes, "Hey, I found who I am! I discovered this hero!".  That's like in the game you found you "had" to kill thousands to become evil or somewhat good. That plotline compares you the Hero to Jackson.  So I guess that in finding youself, there is always a good part, but can't always be justified.  And for this theme to be communicated in BOTH a movie AND a computer game made me realize that themes are communicated so openly, that you just have to look for them.  Also, I know I am NOT on the dot, but it really made me think.
