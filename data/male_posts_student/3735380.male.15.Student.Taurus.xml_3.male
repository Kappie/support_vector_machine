My mom is really beginning to complain that I'm not tan enough. "You need dark skin to attract ladies.", "You look anemic.", "A tan would get you some popularity, or a girlfriend.", or my favorite: "When we go on our vacation, you're going to get real bad sunburn."  Who needs that? My skin is perfect as a slightly pale white. I don't need a tan. I'm one of those people who look bad with one. I'm just a regular pale-skinned friendly person. Maybe a little gold would work, but mainly I look perfectly normal with this skin color.  Usually we're dead on Sundays. Until about 5:30, we were. People then came in waves of about 5 separate groups each. Probably a baseball game across the street.  Near the end of the day, about 6:30, this group of 6 girls came in. They seemed a little nervous about me. They bought food and sat down.  15 minutes later, my supervisor let me take the night off. 15 minutes early isn't much, but it's enough time to eat my meal, and I was thankful for that. I clocked out and sat down next to and facing the side door, as I always do.  I finished my food, fries, and the group of girls passed me. They said "Hey, sexy!" and giggled. I almost jumped.  So much for my mom's advice. Look what a tan would  lose  me. I guess my skin color is fine with what I had now.  It's not time to get my ego all flared up because of that, but it really is an interesting situation. Maybe I don't need a tan. Maybe they're just joking.  Whatever it was, it sure was surprising.
