I don't see anything wrong with that.. but I think that people NEED something to do.. in case they end up having nothing to talk about.. in case they bore each other - they have something fun to do to make it seem not so bad.   I'm thinking you should have gone to Oldham today though.. they'll eventually stop asking you to go places.. I know because that's what we did to a few friends, we got sick of hearing "no" or some lame ass excuses. Go next time! You might find that wherever you go is fun.. at least you'll be with people. Hermit. =P   Pssst, the harm in going for a walk is that it's exercise ! =P *hugs you lots*  Edit: I'm thinking you should have gone to Oldham today though... I meant yesterday..
