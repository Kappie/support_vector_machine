I may call up my good buddy Jason and see if he wants to go golfing next week. Personally, I hate golfing, I find the game pointless. You are expected to hit a little ball so far and land in the place that you want it to. Right, the only thing that ends up where I want it to is my driver in the pond! The beginning of the summer is horrible for me. I wasn't home for 3 hours today before I was bored out of my mind! Imagine what I am going to do over the summer. Yeesh! Well, it's only 7:18, and time is going by so slowly! Maybe I'll go for a walk, and that can be the highlight of my day!  Mike :P
