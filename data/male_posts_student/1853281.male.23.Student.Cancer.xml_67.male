I feel horrible, ill, headachy, and my throat is coated with some nast film. Smoking really is disgusting, but so so sweet. Oh i love the Camels, but they don't love me. Will try and not smoke tonight.  Have been reading all sorts of inspiring things on the net, and my souls is starting to graduallycome back. I want to do all sorts of things like Kill my TV and go veggie and grow things and care about people and effect change etc. It will be interesting to see how long this lasts.
