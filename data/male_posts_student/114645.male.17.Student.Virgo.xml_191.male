She is scary anyway. “Monica called the former president's account of their relationship dishonest and said he is a "revisionist of history" who has missed an opportunity to undo some of the damage their entanglement caused her.” *as reported from the Daily Mail, London*  I find that funny. LOL. Anywho. I worked today, set up a printer, then I came home and found out I have a potential job for another artist. That is cool! LOL. Well I am outta things to say. Zen and I may hang out, but I dunno.
