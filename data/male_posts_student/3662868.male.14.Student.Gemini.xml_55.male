It's my grandparrents wedding anniversary, I don't know how many years they've been married, but it's been a damn long time.    Me being the procrastinator I am, I'm packing now. We leave in less than 3 hours. Good planning right? Well, the only plan is there is no plan. Thats my motto. Anyways, I might, repeat, might be on aim, etc while I'm there. Last time I was on a lot, but that's cuz I could be...But, situations and conditions change...   until then, I'm out.
