It never occurred to me that maybe they too went through the same crap I did and perhaps had found solutions to life's mysteries.  It just never occurred to me.    Now here I am getting ready to pack up the car with my girlfriend and go drive to spend time with her family. (Please pause from reading and go watch the movie  Meet the Parents. ) Now you know what I have to look forward to.  So what  does this have to do with experience?   Not too long ago I was asked to address the Board of Trustees of Hellenic College and Holy Cross as the new SGA President.  I was ridiculously nervous about the whole ordeal.  Imagine a large conference room full of suits and dignitaries from all over the country who have been listening to report after report all day.  Now enter this 25 yr old "kid" who wants to talk to them.  Yeah.  So all these thoughts were running around in my head.  What if I trip?  What if I get up there and can't think of anything to say?  What if I say something stupid? What if I have something on my face? What if? What if? What if?    But I did it.  And not only was I fine, but I even received a million compliments afterwards.  I met and shook the hands of so many "important people" that I could have been running for president of the USA.  The point is I did it despite all the what ifs. The same thing happens with chanting.  I seriously, without exaggeration, feel like puking before I chant something solo.  My time comes and I honestly have no clue what I'm doing and somehow the instant I open my mouth the sound comes out beautifully.  To bring it all back, these and other experiences have been times when I have been full of doubt, low self-esteem, minimum confidence, and yet I just did it. (sorry NIKE)  The guy in Meet The Parents was a shmuck.  I am not.  I know in the end that I will be fine.  The times of trial I've had up to this day have proven that to me.  So I guess I'll either be typing my next post in the safe confines of the Village or from a lonely bus stop somewhere in the middle of Ohio borrowing the laptop of some well to do college undergrad who just decided to bus across the country.  take it easy folks.
