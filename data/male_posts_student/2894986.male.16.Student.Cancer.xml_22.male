With todays victory, my team completed its first undefeated regular season. The 6-0 victory in the blistering heat of Sunday summer afternoon capped off the season in spectacular fashion. The whole season my team had playd very well together, which surprised me considering this is the first season many of us had played together. But the way we played today was amazing. We played as a team, passing the ball well, calling for the ball, and looking to get someone else a goal. I did score two goals, but it was a total team effort. We scored three goals off direct kicks, one off of a PK, and Bailey added a header into the mix. Jacob finished off the season with yet another performance in goal. It jsut goes to show you, having a great goalie is the first step in building a winning team.   But this is jsut the middle of the season. 2 weeks from now, while I'm enjoying my trip to Greece and Egypt, my team will be winning our ticket to Bowling Green for the Tide Cup. The fun is just beginning. I am really looking forward to the all the fun we are gonna have this summer. Who knows? Maybe this is the year. Finally.
