I'll skip right to the library CIP. Yes. I was having a terrible flu. You can imagine the horrors of an air-conditioned place! It's hell on the sinuses! I kept sneezing and sneezing, and my sinuses kept running down. I felt so miserable!  Yes. About the work. Me and CQ were assigned the children's section again! Wah! Worked there all day long! HaHa! At the last hour, the librarians decided that we should broaden our sights and worked at other sections. We were assigned to Young Fiction, Chinese Fiction and Non-Fiction, Cookery and the magazines section at the end. We found Gloria there and we worked together to clear our load. Heh Heh.  After that we went to KFC to eat. Joyce soon joined us afterwards. Sigh. She persuaded me to go Expo with her, 'cause she needs my expert opinion on computer. Right. I wanted to go home and rest, but since she needed me, I go with her lor. What are friends for ma?  I slept on the train. Slept slept slept. I was so damn tired and cold. Oh yes. Did I tell you? I wore my jacket the WHOLE day. Everywhere I went, the jacket's with me. So cold man!   Yes. We reached Expo and met WQ. Woah! Joyce is an efficient shopper. She takes a look at the CD-Burner, decided that it was good, then brought it just like that. The same thing for her Discman. Well, I didn't say it was bad. Heck..the Expo was so crowded..so what she did was good and efficient. I just never encountered a shopper like her before. HaHa!   After that, we went to Orchard to eat sushi buffet. HaHa. I was quite recovered by then. Even the sushi is very nice. I sat the nearest to the conveyor belt, so I ended up taking orders for everyone. HaHa! Right. What a fulling dinner.  Right. After that, we went back home lor. Even ducks were meowing and mooing. I bathed, then slept. Too tired.   Sunday   Hmm. Shall I skip to the exciting part? Yeah. The morning and early afternoon's boring anyways. Yep. I met Amanda, WQ and Wendy at 4.30. Okay. Most of them were late. Some were excusable, while some were just late to annoy people. Right. No morals!   We took the train towards Orchard. We met SuPing on the train at Admiralty. Okay..we went to Delifrance to eat dinner. HaHa. I ate Pasta Gratin. What a nice pasta gratin!   After our dinner, it was a mad rush to the cinema! The show's about to show and we are so close to being late! Yes!  Onto the movie! Prisoner of Azkaban! Right... duringthe first few minutes, the projector spoilt twice and everyone was complaining and complaining. I thought the management will give us complimentary tickets, but oh well. No such luck. Yes. The movie. I digressed. It's bascially okay. A tad dissappointing. I mean, it didn't really stay true to the book. A lot was changed around. I think people who didn't read the book would have enjoyed this movie far better than avid readers (with the exception of our WQ, of course). Non-plot-wise, it is a good movie. I loved the special effects and the acting skills of the actors. Really improved a lot. Hermione was more prominently featured in the movie. I also loved the new Dumbledore. Professor Trelawney is damn cute and funny! Emma Thompson really did a good job protraying her! YaY! HaHa! There were loads of funny bits, but I don't want to spoil this for me friends. Watch then you know! :)   Okay. After the movie, we went to take NeoPrints. Yes. We saw a lot of Goths. they were quite fascinating, yet scary at the same time. Why people becomes Goths is beyond me. Right.   WQ wanted to go back. I felt obligated to accompany him. On the way to Orchard MRT, he's acting so bastardly that I left him and joined Amanda they all to shop. I wanted to shop in the first place. Right.   We tried to shop, but the shops were closed. We brought drinks, sat down and talked and then went home. All of us alighted at Admiralty and went home lor. By that time it's 11pm+. I bathed, then watched Practical Magic (really nice movie!) till 12, then I fell asleep.   Today   Well well. It's quite an eventful day. Yes. Skip skip right to 1pm. We have just finished lunch. Our performance group was supposed to meet at 1 to practise on our songs. People came in late. Oh well.   Choir was quite good compared to the last time. Yes. Very good. Anyway, our group have to spilt up, because we can't sing a single song with 6 people. Me, Boon Chai, CQ spilt up and Gloria joined us. HaHa. Now we are singing Wu Ding! What a nice song! YaY! My dream came true!  Right. I came back, ate dinner, watched TV and came online. Of course I watched Friends just now. HAHAHA! Another funny episode! HAHA!   Right. Today's entry is very rushed, due to me being very tired and I got distracted..again. Right. Okay. So I'll end here. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
