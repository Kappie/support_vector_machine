But the problem with her is that she is a stuburn girl and would probably deny my help but Damn it Brandi you know we would end up fighting it and we would go after it for a good 1/2 hour or so and since I usually win all our fights we would just sit down and you would tell whats going on. So would blab on and on about how your problems are and I'm just joking babe don't kill me you don't blab.............. a lot. Joking again. But I have to go but seriously Brandi when ever you want to talk just call me. Love Ya much
