Its a long story, adn i still want to get some CS in before I get kicked off the comp...  Anyway... Long time since I last posted, well, *check blog*  4 days... seems like an eternity... anywho...  here goes  Friday: Not much of note, my plan of ripping of second years in trades suffered a major setback as i realised Yao had already taken everything that was worth anything off them. for that matter, this isn't a major setback, more like a fatal one... :/  Saturday: Saturday we had the Chess thingy... we came second and Sullivan won... surprise surprise...  Only real thing that is worth mentioning is that Simon lost in like 10 moves to a crappy guy from St Malachy's  Sunday: *rubs hands in glee* Oh ho ho, don't get me started on Sunday, *realises* oh wait I already have got myself started on Sunday... in fact I think I'll devote a *drum roll* WHOLE post on Sunday, *listens to sound of one hand clapping*  Bleh...
