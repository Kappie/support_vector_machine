Dunno why... but i find today's SNL... simple and good... the flow was good... the praise and worship was simple and not really added with special effects or whatever... its just well done with the presence of God... lolX~... ^^  Really thank God for being with us... just pray that he continue to mould my cell into something he want it to be... ^^and build up the bond between the brothers... ^^ ... Glory Goes To The Father In Heaven~!!
