I smell Indian food a'brewin'. And the creepy sound of a pressure cooker being opened.  Did most of my Costa Rica shopping yesterday. (Random: Why isn't the prefix 'yester' used more often? I should fix that.) I stil gotta get some more stuff, some osrta mosquito cage type dealy. And I should probably make some vague attempt to get in shape before partaking in hours of backbreaking hard labor. Meh. And I'd better start on that Cipro...  Downstairs my sister is playing some computer games that involves lots of popping and whistle noises. Neat, by which I mean annoying.  'The Long Fuse' is the best history text we've been assigned EVER. It winseseses.  Whaelse...  Downstairs: "Brunch is ready!" And away I go.
