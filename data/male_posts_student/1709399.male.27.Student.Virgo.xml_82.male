Illayaraja shows why he is called the maestro with skillful  wonderful use of Stringed Instruments to create a delight for the ears. There has never been a question about his Genius but this Album didn't become too famous with the masses but just ended up in the shelves of the classes.                                                  Particularly his usage of Violin in this Album is awesome.
