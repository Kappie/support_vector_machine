Harley.... NO ONE CARES... w.e anyways she stayed overf a couple of nights and i think it was like her way of trying to get with me... luckily nothing happened but i really really have no feelings for her--- shes just so... ugh.. gross. I dunno.. shes kinda tall and really skinny... she smells kinda funky... her feet are all callousy and her hands are really gross too.. she does so much stuff to her face that she has uglified it... hmm it kinds hurts to talk about her like this but its just so true -- i really dont like her. shes off to New Brunswick for a while .. family trip or something. and she thinks shes hot shit... she talks about her future as if only her decisions matter or have any sort of importance... every time i tell her that you knw i look forward to mcgill and being in university and whatnot she comes back at me with this stupid smirk and says.... well. you know.... youre the type of person who wont succeed in university... like what the fuck... i thought we were friends here and i was all.. he just because youre gonna get stuck in BCIT (not that its bad at all -- i just wanna go to uni) you dont have to take out your stupid regrets out on me... you screwed up academically and your love life sucks.. she goes out with these retarded people that only want to get with me haha its soo sad but w.e i really  dont mind her otherwise. she showed me her sketchbook the other night... talking about her 'technique' and all this bullshit she doesn't have... well its actually kind of saddening... she thinks shes this really great artist but her paintings and work have no feeling at all - theyre all pretty much crap... i dont have the heart to tell her because she tries to damned hard... i just wanna like pull her back and say - hey you know what.. your art sucks... it has no depth.. value.... or feeling at all. everything looks so 2dimensional yet she brags about how its so so great and no... it's not. Every time i talk to her about my achievements she pushed me down shes like oh well you know you only got it because your school is so small... and i say fuck you -- you know what i dont need this crap... i think im a great person and ive grown really tired of you...your friends only hang out with you because they feel sorry for you - youre really just a sad loser... get over yourself... youre not that great -- yeesh and again i have to admit she is one person that i have confided in about everything about me.. she knows a lot about me but not the most important part of me which is reserved for only certain people... yeah... i almost told Gabe who is becoming a pretty good friend of mine...yaargh it just gets me so mad that Harley thinks she so fucking high and mighty... like oh yeah im painting the gazebo because SOOOOOOO many people are counting on me... no theyre not you retardyoure just a pompous, talentless bitch who wont get anywhere because you cant get over yourself.... i wish there was some good stuff i could say about her but no... everything is about her... everything she wants she has to get whenever it pleases her... ewww...well you know what... not anymore... you have really  ugly shoes too... haha that sounds so shallow but shes the cheapest person ever... she has money but she walks around in these messed up scraggly-ass shoes... argh... i have no idea why i hang out with her --- shes such a loser... yet... i dont know... somethings keeping us bound... but i hope the binding loosens soon. maybe after this trip to new brunswick she'll chill out a bit ---  AAANYHOO-- back to Kate..  yeah so i havent heard from her since... tuesday or wedneday i think and its starting to bother me - i think ill drop her a line maybe give her a call let her know im still interested in her...  oh today i had this long and deep discussion with my good buddy Gabe - shes the coolest girl ever but she gets involved in such crappy relationships... hmmm they guy she has been dating doesnt really appreciate her and i think its breaking her heart. i would seriously go out with her but she doesnt know --- haha i lead such a double life its not even funny... i think it might become a problem soon when people meet other people i know -- and argh... especially now with me being int he public eye because of certain achievements. haha its not so bad at all. but back to gabe - she really needed someone to tell her that she was really a great girl and i took this job upon myself because i really believe she is.... we talked about everything and nothing all at once and she told me how i am so very undefined... and i asked her..... well.. how so hmm.. you knoow what it'll be easier if you just read our convo... then again... no i dont think she would appreciate that --- nope i will just tell you the crude details that only pertain to myself - such as... okay i am scred of comitment. theres no other way to put it - i wont get involved with a girl because everytime i start to something inside me panics or something.. i swear i have no idea and i just go into a frenzy.. okay no maybe i dont go into a frenzy but i do break it off.. why? i dont know because im a n idiot i guess...there was this one girl whos name we shall not mention.... i got to know her pretty well but then she did the unthinkable.. she gave me a kiss that was to mark the begining of a more serious relationship ..... sooooo.... ive only spoken to her once more and it was kind of awkward. i dunno it was just weird and uncomfortable and i have no desire to see her again oi havent had any long deep talks with her because i have no idea what to be around her - haha and the thing is get this my friend abe has a friend who's cousin is this wonderful girl im talking about.... *sigh* ... if i wasn't such a coward i would call her up and ask her out on a date  yaaar...  then i remember that im broke and really cant afford to take anyone out.. not even myself out for some coffee or w.e.. hmmm this depresses me but i really have to get a job or else i will be doing absolutely nothing for the rest of the summer and that would be a very boring and tedious waste of time.... :-S hmmm i think i will go to all the strabucks in this city and bed and plead for a job... i will too... haha i need to get PAAAAAID and...... laid. haha yeah...anyhoo now i must go take a shower because i feel like a filthy pig - eww its like 7.30 at night.... and its not really night either its stills o light out.... hummm. well have a good one.. ill write late on tonight prolly...   ciao babes
