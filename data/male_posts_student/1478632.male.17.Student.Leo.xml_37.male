Whether I'm cleaning my car, as I did this morning, or I'm at work cleaning up the mess of Ranch Dressing someone decided to leave in the middle of an aisle, there has been one thing on my mind: Whitesnake. lol, no, not Whitesnake. It's been Laura, my girlfriend. Yes, believe it or not, I am going out with someone, like I said in my last post. And unlike some other people I know, we aren't the kind of couple that bases our relationship on lust (at least not yet :P). There's no way that  can explain why I like her as much as I do. She's smart, she's funny, and she's really pretty too. How she ended up liking  me,  of all people, I'll never know. I sit here in my computer chair, in front of my computer screen, trying to hear the music from my headphones over the blenderlike noises coming from my computer, and no matter what is going on, I just can't seem to stop thinking about her. My one fear at this point is that we'll grow apart like she and Matt did. Yes, Matt, her last boyfriend (I think), and one of my close friends. I don't konw why I've done it, but I broke one of my personal rules by dating my friend's ex. No, it's not like she's his property or anything, but I just usually don't make it a habit to do this. I haven't talked to him since the morning before Laura and I started going out, but I can't help but wonder how he feels about all this. *le sigh* I just hope he isn't too mad...
