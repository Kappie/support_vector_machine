It could probably even be made into a video game, but if anyone like Nintendo is reading this, you might think I'm crazy.  It started with me and my family in a cabin, enjoying our lives in the Medieval times.  I was warned that I had to stop a scientist from using his experiment, because it would fail and possibly destroy half the world (somewhat like Doc Ock's experiment in Spiderman 2).  I ran over to the place where the scientist was doing his demonstration. He turned his machine on. I was too late.  This created tornado force raindrops that were actually entire ponds and lakes repelled by the machine, but no wind. I took quick shelter.  After the raindrop bullets ended, the town got out of their houses. There was no water at all except the dew left from the experiment. All the water on this side of the world has been jetted to the other side of the world. I was set out on a mission to go to the other side of the world and bring that water back, before it was too late and everyone died from dehydration.  So I started, and only got halfway through until I woke up. Now don't tell me that wasn't a crazy dream.
