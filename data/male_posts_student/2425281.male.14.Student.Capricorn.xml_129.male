I've just finished my geo assignment and now have to complete a 2 page essay on women's role and attitude changes during and after WWII and it's actually worth  something like 10 percent of something or other.  AAARRGGGHHH!!! Plus and english speech. DOUBLE AAARRGGGHHH!!! Thanks Yi Long for helping me with the geo, you're the best.
