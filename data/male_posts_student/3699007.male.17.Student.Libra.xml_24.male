I thought she wouldn't remember who I was, or much of anything else, but in 3 hours of talking with her, the only thing she couldn't remember was what church her former preacher had gone to.  Still, she has a brain tumor, and it is a very serious condition, regardless of how she acts.  Hopefully, the doctor will fix it bright and early monday morning and she will be fine.  The surgeon told her "I'm not God, but I work for him."  I like that.  Was talking to my uncle yesterday and I may start working at the Gwinnett Arena.  Interview is July 21st.  Get paid to see concerts, basically.  Sweet.  If anybody actually reads this, I'd like to thank my friends for the thoughts and prayers for my grandmother.  Y'all are great.  Ok, I'm out...I need to find something to do because I can't sit here and have a 5 hour conversation with 2 hot girls because they're both in FL now.  :-)
