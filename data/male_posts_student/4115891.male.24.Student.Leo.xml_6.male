And foremost we believe in the unmitigated right of this nations people to pursue happiness.  Here, in America, we elect our leaders for the sole purpose of bringing to us these good things.    Recently however it seems our leaders have attempted to limit good things.  On Tuesday, February 24, 2004 President George W. Bush stood before America in the Roosevelt room and offered his endorsement for an amendment to ban same sex union in this country.  Eight years prior President Bill Clinton signed into law the “Defense of Marriage Act” which defined marriage as the legal union of one man and one woman.  With few exceptions, the attitude toward same sex union in this nation has been overwhelmingly negative.  The most recent example of this is yesterday’s approval by the voters of Missouri to instate a constitutional amendment to ban same sex marriage.  In closer examination of this conflict one can’t help but notice the terms and rhetoric being thrown around.  I hear phrases like “defense of marriage” and “family values” and I can not help but wonder if someone has their priorities inside out.  “Marriage” and “family” are abstractions, mere titles above columns as we sort through life.  These are simply terms for the complex, and wonderful preexisting phenomenon that many people arrive to, in, or at with or without any given labels.  It is at best a highly dubious notion that any government or institution can distribute or deny the objective world in such a way, and even more ridiculous that any people are made to suffer because of such an absurdity.    The sin in all this is not that people engaged in same sex relations are missing the wholesome and vitalizing essence of human interaction, intimacy, mutual respect, and all the other wonders of close fellowship; for indeed these occur regardless of anyone’s acknowledgement.  The real offense is that in such a good country, devoted primarily to the happiness of its people, its happy people are not recognized by their country.  The United States can ill afford to over look and refuse to validate what so obviously is a meaningful, spiritual, and most importantly veridical good of its people.
