However, I still got pimp slapped several times after said achievements. I decided I'd had enough, and played Counter-Strike the rest of the weekend. On Tuesday I dropped  urlLink Mike  off at Charlotte Douglas International and on Sunday I picked him up. He mentioned something about a high school freshman girl getting it on with an 18 year old guy on the dance floor of a California club. I'm sure he'll tell you all about it.  But that's not what Thanksgiving's supposed to be about, now is it (not that I care). So now for the family-oriented Thanksgiving breakdown. My aunt, uncle, cousins came to town like they always do. My uncle is a medic in the FBI and just got back from Iraq (am I allowed to say that?). Of course he had lots of cool photos to share, including one of him sitting on Saddam's throne. Rock on. My aunt was her usual polite and quaint self. My cousins were interesting. My female cousin's superiority complex continues to blossom, as does her stomach. She's a nice girl, but both are going to be problematic for her when she grows up. My boy cousin was all dressed up like a marine when I got to my grandmother's house, which was cute.  (OMG shut up mom. No I don't want to explain what I'm typing at 11:00 at night. She doesn't know about this blog and I don't trust her judgemental self with all this personal information. But anyways, let's continue...)  He came over and spent the night. We let him shoot the painball gun and he played with the pets. He walked in on me playing CS right as I was blowing heads apart, and I promptly explained to him that this type of thing was happening in Iraq right now, hoping he'd understand. I hope I didn't disturb him too badly (God I feel like an ass). The food was pretty good. They left, and my normal weekend routine began.  I played some racquetball with my dad, which was awesome (and humbling too, since he's got a lot of gut and still managed to beat me 2 out of 3 times), went bowling with my youth group, and clicked some more mizzouse. School resumes tomorrow, AKA my 8 hour personal hell, which sux. But there's one person I'm especially looking forward to seing...  ME: So there's this girl...  READERS: *sigh* there's always a girl... this could get ugly  ME: No, no, let me explain!  1) She's humble: she acknowledges her flaws, and wants to know if she's doing something wrong or being annoying, which of course she never is. 2) She's happy: she relishes hugs, and always has a smile on her face. She has an inner warmth that is absolutely contagious. 3) ...and I think she likes me. I have my sources, ones that she specifically told not to tell me, but of course they did.  I came to watch her cheerlead for a Varsity basketball game Tuesday night. After that we went to dinner and had a blast. I got kinda sick so I actually had to leave on time, but I would have stayed hours longer if I could have. If you're reading this, I'd would really  really  like to do it again some time.  Sealed with a hug or two (or ten), JD
