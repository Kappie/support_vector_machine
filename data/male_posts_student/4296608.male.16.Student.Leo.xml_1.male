I even put off going out and enjoying myself thinking "this is what responsible people do"...  Well you know what ??  aparently I wasn't meant to be responsible ;p   I decided that since I wasnt going out I would catch a bus to the video store and get a few movies ( mistake #1)     So I spent some time there and walked back to the bus stop...now lemme tell ya that I'm really not that good with buses. So when the bus came to the stop and I saw that I didnt say "San Juan" on it and instead said "Plaza las Americas (a giant mall we have down here in PR"   ~~~ From here on feel free to say "what an idiot..."    I figured.....It'll probably pass my house, no worries, and got on...  It started towards my house and I was feeling like a smartass, and then it turned off the road.  "It's probably just gonna take a roundabout route, no worries."  Nope....no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no...wrong awnser~ Will, you are the weakest link.  so the bus kept on going down the streets and I sort of got lost...but the interesting thing was that what weiging most heavily on my mind was the fact that for some reason all the buss stops are rights before traffic lights here. Lemme explain how this works.  Bus moves, gets to stop (light is green), waits for everyone to get off, then starts to move~but wait !!! nope, can't move cuz now the light is RED...that happened at every damn stop...oh well  So anyway, I ended up at the mall and so I figured "What is beter to study with than a game ?" So I went to the stores and chipped out my money for electronic entertainment :)  Anyhow eventually I got home and started studying, but it's hard to do with a friend in the room watching movies...I'm sure I wrote stuff like "  The Azteks are well known for I'm going to kill bill, and the human sacrifices they used the 5 point exploding heart technique "   and other good things :)   But eventually I got some work done, but not as much as I wanted so I have to work more today, but instead I'm writting this heheheh...Post your comments on time wasting or whatever floats your boat.
