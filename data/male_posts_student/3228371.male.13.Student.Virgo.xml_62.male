We bought some water for our water machine thing that you usually find in office buildings. Very cool. Anyway... So yeah... when we drove there, I saw Nima still at the bench outside the school and when we came back, he was walking down Grover Hill. Missed him so much while I was gone. Couldn't stop thinking about him. Hee hee~ I'm crazy... about him.  So anyway... Got home and helped my mom carry the stuff into the house... so damn heavy. Then we put the thing together and then I went upstairs. I wanted ice-cream but was too lazy to get some. Went upstairs, turned on the computer, and checked my email. I read Jay's blog and he said something about these two guys in suits going up to his house and he found out that they were mormons. Oooh~ Coolness! Cool but scary. Cool only because they're weird. Don't like 'em. I talked to him on MSN about mormons (right now) and he explained to me that they're just weird people who are kind of Christian-ish. They make up stuff that aren't in the Bible. Kinda like the devil. Kinda scary. I'm grateful I've never met any mormons yet.  Spent lunch recess with Nima. I missed him and didn't get to talk to him too much so yeah... Hee hee~ I hope he didn't mind to had to have spent the entire lunch recess with me instead of playing basketball with his friends. I just like spending time with him... no matter where or when. I really hope he didn't mind. I know he'd rather be playing basketball though. Not gonna make him do that much anymore... hee hee.  Bethel tonight~ Yay! I wonder if Nima could come or not... I really hope he can. I know that his parents don't want him to belong to a religion and that he thinks he's too young to commit to one and I respect that. I only want him to come so that I can spend time with him. POP... in the gym. Wonder what's gonna be happening.  Haha! Still talking to Jay on MSN. He asked if Ingimon (Ingrid) is going to Bethel. She usually goes so yeah... told him that and he told me they made up an attack for her. LMAO! She spits out 3 gummy bears at her enemy. LMAO! GUMMY BEARS RULE! Her weakness is eating and sleeping. LmAozZ~! Funnyness! [inside joke] Gummy Bear Trio rox!  I miss Nima... He's so captivating. :) I love him so much... I swear, it's impossible for me to get annoyed or mad at him. I love him. I mean it too when I say that. Why else would I miss him so much?! I miss his brown eyes, his irresistable smile, his gentle touch, just everything about him. I love him so much.   He said he'd call me when he got home or whatever. Hee hee~ I wonder when he'll get home...! *yawnzZ* A little tired... but it's not gonna stop me from going to Bethel! Can't miss POP! Hee hee! Anyway... I'm gonna go back to talking to Konez and Jay... blog later. Bye bye~~   Note to Nima  I hope you don't mind me talking to him so much. If you do, let me know. It's nothing serious or whatever. He's just a really cool guy that I look at as a brother. Nothing more. :) Remember that I love YOU! XoXo~
