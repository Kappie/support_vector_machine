"I'm working on it Stram, I'm working!" shouted Stewie to his friend in peril. Stramboli and Stewie had been friends for about 10 years now, and knew eachother like the backs of their palms. They were both 15 years old and lived life very nonchalantly. They lived in a mountanious area surrouned by mountains of coure and many trees and waterfalls. Everyday they would go out into the mountains exploring, and today Stramboli happened to fall into the river. The current was strongly pulling him towards the 20 story high death trap, the Topeka Waterfall! "You dunce!" screamed Stewie "how the hell did you manage to fall into the frickin river?!" Stewie threw a long branch at Stramboli as he was yelling. Stramboli grabbed on and pulled himself up to shore sputtering out mangled phrases. "Gahgbag I'm ok." Stramboli was very flustered and needed to lay down for awhile before speaking again. But before he could do so, something started flopping around in Stramboli's pants. "My God" muttered Stewie. Stramboli reached into his pants and pulled out a whopping big fish. "Looks like I caught myself dinner!" yellped Stramboli in utter disbelief. The boys decided to start on home sharing their story about the river adventure with eachother, each time adding another part that was not mentioned before. As they were walking, the boys ran into a freakin huge bear! The boys both screamed "Jee Wilikers", and ran for their lives.
