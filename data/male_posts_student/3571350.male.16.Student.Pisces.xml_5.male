I've been on the computer most of the day and watched coronation street today because it's one of my favourite shows. It's a british soap opera that is 30 mins long and i haven't missed an episode since last winter when I got into it. We ordered out for supper. I had my favourite food which is hamburgers :) the rest of my family had an all dressed pizza  yuuck! I especially hate the peppers on there. The only way i'll eat a pizza is with cheese nothing else on it. Someone said i was depressed in the comments but i don't feel depressed. I'm not always mad or sad it's just that my mood can go from mad-happy in a minute but when i'm mad i go almost all out. Is that a teenager thing or is it just me? Today and last night I watched the trailer of the movie Saved! I wanna see that movie so much now. It's about a teenager who was at the top of the popular list at her catholic high school but got pregnant etc. and had to deal with a lot of stuff. It seems like a good movie and it's usually funny. Well it's been a boring but pleasant day for me. Hope i keep up the happiness :)
