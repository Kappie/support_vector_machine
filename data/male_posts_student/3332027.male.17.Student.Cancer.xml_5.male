Time will tell if I go back. For now, just working on me is good. I still want that relationship; don't get me wrong! But as far as being everyone's personal assistant, wardrobe consultant, secret agent, and psychologist, I'm threw. I don't need that stress. I'm just going to keep to myself and not even let out a helping hand. I'm just taken for granted and I don't need that. I want to thank my ex for helping me realize that. I had a conversation with him yesterday. It was ok, no more benefits and i have to get a reality check that, that part of him is gone forever and it's not coming back. I also decided to stop drinking. No more stress, no more reason to drink.   Here's another song. It's basically saying that I'm leaving my life behind cause I don't want to be the one who's down anymore. The song is saying that I'm leaving someone, the truth is I'm leaving who I use to be.       "Here I am take me It's easier to give in Some people mistake me They only hear what they want to hear If you're losing sleep Forgive me I just can't keep pretending  I'm packing my bags 'cause I don't wanna be The only one who's drowning in their misery And I'll take that chance 'cause I just wanna breathe And I won't look back and wonder how it's supposed to be How it's supposed to be  There's a prism by the window It lets the light leak in I wish you would let me You feel the water but do you swim? And it's only me empty-handed With a childish grin and a camera  I'm packing my bags 'cause I don't wanna be The only one who's drowning in their misery And I'll take that chance 'cause I just wanna breathe And I won't look back and wonder how it's supposed to be How it's supposed to be  la da da da  I'm packing my bags 'cause I don't wanna be The only one who's drowning in their misery And I'll take that chance 'cause I just wanna breathe And I won't look back and wonder how it's supposed to be How it's supposed to be  'Cause I'm packing my bags And I won't be back"   *WondEr WhaT i'M DoiNG ThiS MeMoriAL DaY*
