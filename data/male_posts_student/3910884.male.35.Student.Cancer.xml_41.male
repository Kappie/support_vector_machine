Yearly rainy seasons since the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo have been devastating to the Pampangan region with several towns being totally immersed and buried in lahar.    Despite the devastation created by the lahar, the Kampampangans have overcome their misfortunes and have rebuilt their lives sometimes literally above their burried homes. Again their attitude to overcome obstacles and tradgedies is apparent in their daily struggle to overcome adversity.     Also visited several beautiful churches (some affected tremendously and some unscathed), made some wishes and said some prayers.
