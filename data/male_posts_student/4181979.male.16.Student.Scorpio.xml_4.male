Today was the 35th convocation of IIT DELHI!!! /...bleh...(u think i am intersested???)  Anyway,did some matrices and determinants....and wasted a lot of time but not knowing how.....actually,i did NOT waste a lot of time...i just feel that i did.,...i don't know....there i go babbling again!  So....Saurabh had called over some friends (Sirat and i think some nirmalya(?) )  for lunch or some thing.... (bleh!)  so...actually nothing.  As a reader,you must be quite aquainted with my current state of mind by the usage of repetative unintersesting speech words and topics... BLEH!  Anyway,went to maasi's in the evening....And ya...before i forget.....played a li'l tennis outside the house itself....after a LOOONG LOOONG TIME!!... And again the cable-man came asking for the money and AGAIN i argued for a better reception and again he went away disappointed!  Ya...where was i?ya....went to maasi's in the evening.Kannu came back with us. AND had another torrid car journey!(i am not sure if that's the rigt word as i dont even know its exact meaning momentarily and dont even care coz of an exasperated state of a relatively entropic mind!!  Anyway, came back and trhen made a li'l of my physics practical file! BLEH! And another BLEH!!
