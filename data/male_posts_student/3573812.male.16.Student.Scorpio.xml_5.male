GOD I CAN'T WAIT!!!  I don't have anything to say really other than ... no I have nothing.  I haven't eaten breakfast and I really ought to.  Ow my stomach is grumbling.  Shhhhhh stupid stomach!  School starts in 1 minute and I need to eat something so I should probably go.  'auto-de-fe, a capillary hint of red, only this manupod, crescent in shape has escaped'
