Whatever crime against humanity it was that I committed, it comes with a horrible, horrible duration of doing penance.  Today that penance was watching my new store manager easily woo the ladies I've worked with for years.  Talk about your "seduced by power" scenario.  Another part of the reparations was cleaning every inch of chrome in the store from top to bottom.  It was like a male Medusa, you scrub the chrome clean until you can see your own face, but you quickly turn away because of what you see there.  The art of being single is quickly becoming it's own satirical work.
