I think it's partly due to the environment. Hilly river valley inland, versus Pacific coast. There's also just a different vibe here. Everything in California is so much more vibrant and alive. That makes me feel more energetic and crazy. Here even when it's not snowing, it just doesn't have that feeling. It's also that here I don't get the chance to be crazy. Everything is just so neutral here.   The  Short Music for Short People  compilation always reminds me of Summer of 1999.   Ok time for breakfast.  ***
