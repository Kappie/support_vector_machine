The following is a quote from an official Planned Parenthood pamphlet :    "Is birth control an abortion?" "Definitely not. An abortion kills the life of a baby after it has begun. It is dangerous to your life and health. It may make you sterile so that when you want a child you cannot have it. Birth control merely post-pones the beginning of life." Currently, the number of abortions Planned Parenthood does increases each year as it converts more of its clinics to killing centers. In 1985 it had 51 chambers which killed 110,000. By 1994 it had 70 which killed 134,000. Every year, it refers to other facilities almost as many abortions as it does itself. Planned Parenthood has even promoted a pro-abortion "comic book," geared for teenagers, entitled Abortion Eve. On the back cover is a caricature of the "Assumption of the Blessed Virgin" depicting a pregnant Mary with the idiot face of Mad magazine’s Alfred E. Neumann. The caption says, "What, me worry?" One Planned Parenthood pamphlet even goes so far as to state:  "In every generation there exists a group of people so filled with bigotry and self-righteousness that they will resort to any means — even violence — to impose their views on society. Today, such fanatics dominate a movement ironically called ‘the Right-to-Life,’ a movement which threatens the most basic of all human rights."  As a matter of fact, Margaret Sanger was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Focusing originally on birth control, as noted, it moved its platform to abortion as the trade became more lucrative. Supposedly focusing on prevention of pregnancy, Planned Parenthood is in an uproar over parental notification laws. Take, for example our own state. The State of Minnesota had such a law in place since 1981. Then the law was challenged in court and suspended in March 1986. The Supreme Court later ruled that the law was constitutional, and it was reimposed. There were excellent records kept for several years with the law in place, several more with-out the law, and then again with the law. Results were very clear.  Perhaps not unexpectedly, the number of abortions to unemancipated minors dropped, and by a figure of 34%. Correspondingly, the number of live births to this group increased. The unexpected result was that the number of  pregnancies  in this age group to unmarried girls decreased by 27%. This is an unprecedented amount, more of a decrease than any other preventive measure previously attempted. I mean, we're all about making abortions RARE, but available, correct? Even Mr. Kerry states this, and I'm assuming DJ Wang stands the same. But is Planned Parenthood pleased? Not at all. In fact, they brought the lawsuit which suspended the law. Planned Parenthood has constantly been telling the world that it wants to reduce teen pregnancies. Here was an outstanding example of an effective method, and Planned Parenthood showed its true stripes. It went to court to stop the only major successful program that limited teen pregnancies. So much for Planned Parenthood’s claims that it wants to reduce teen pregnancies.  Now for some fun facts:  PLANNED PARENTHOOD HAS NOT DECREASED THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS TO UNWED TEENAGERS. The number of births to unmarried mothers hit a record high of 1,165,384 in 1990. That was up 7% in one year and 75% over the decade. Nat'l Center for Health Statistics, June '92. This is after two decades of Planned Parenthood's sex education. PLANNED PARENTHOOD HAS NOT DECREASED THE DEMAND FOR ABORTION. After years of Planned Parenthood programs, legal abortions have increases 101.6% since abortion became legal. According to their own reports, Planned Parenthood itself performs almost 10% of all abortions in the U.S. PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS IN THE ABORTION BUSINESS. Planned Parenthood performed 129,000 abortions in 1991. Compare this to fewer than 5,000 referrals for adoptions, and only 7,000 cases of prenatal care. 1991 Annual Planned Parenthood Federation. This means that less than 10 percent of the services performed for pregnant women at Planned Parenthood have to do with non-abortion services. Planned Parenthood promotes itself as "privately funded". Yet, in 1991 alone they received $124,000,000 of taxpayer dollars in government funds.  Don't argue against parental notification, either... Not old enough to go to war, not old enough to drink, nor vote, not considered a legal adult; a person should not be allowed to have a life-threatening operation done on them without parental knowledge.  That's all I have for now.
