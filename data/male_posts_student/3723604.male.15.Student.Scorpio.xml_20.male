This isn't just a small sandbox... this is the biggest mf-ing sandbox EVER.  It's 12 x 12 and has  SIX   TONS  of sand in it. There's a four foot mound of sand in the middle.  I wish we had done this about ten years ago. My army men never really had a place to put the smack down on eachother.  I am one sad, and tired, panda.  ~Reb
