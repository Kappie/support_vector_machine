Tiffany Webb is amazing, Jonah made for an excellent disgruntled employee and Nathan an excellent chorus member, and the orchestra too was pretty darn good. So hooray! Everybody get hyped!  Michael: Tact 101-- Tact does not mean lying, it means telling the truth gently. And, all jokes about you being dead inside aside, you're going to have to learn to use it because people tend not to like having their feelings hurt, and if you hurt their feelings you will sooner or later find yourself very much without friends.  The Betty-one looks drowsy!
