I need to run for hours in the middle of nowhere. I need to punch something really hard right now. I need to sleep and not wake up for a really long time. I need to cut and see the blood flow and then passout. I need to flip out on something or someone. I need to tell someone how I really feel and not care. I need a break from life, stress, and anger. I need to get away, turn and not look back. I need to climb and tree, fall and break my neck.  That is how I felt last night.. this morning when I finally started to fall asleep the phone rang.. it was my doctor.  She told me that they didnt have all the tests yet (duh I didnt take them all) and she was like we need to get you back in here to take them.. and I started to cry. and I went back to lay down and Ed called me and stuff we talked for a little bit but he had to go then I went back to sleep and I had a really weird dream about going to skewl and Ed was in it.. here is the dream sorta..  I was geting ready to go to skewl it was in the fall and I was moving into my new appartment and my one neighbor was this really freaky guy.. and he came over and he was bothering me and stuff.. well the one night he came over and tried stuff.. and I tried to get him to stop and he wouldnt then he left finally and then I called Ed.. and he came up the next morning and he kinda took care of him.. and I felt really safe when he was up there with me and I didnt want him to leave but I knew he had to go back home to go to skewl so he left and I was crying sitting on my bed and stuff.. and then I woke up and I really was crying..  it was really messed up.. oh well and then I got outta bed and ate dinner and then I listened to mom yell at me and then I went and started to type out my poems again and then Cyndi showed up and we were having fun being all drunk-like and stuff.. then she left and now it is just me and Ed talking.. I hope he can come over tomorrow but if not I understand but I really want him to come over.. well I need to go now.. ttyl ~Donna~
