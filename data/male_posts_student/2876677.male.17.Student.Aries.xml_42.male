This blog needs a name.   Happy Flowers  just isn't milking the goat if you GMD.  I know it was  Dead Souls   but some people aren't well acquainted with the Russian classics and thought it was a bit morbid.   urlLink Send your name   If your blog name is chosen, your name will be put in a hat with 100 of mine and if it is pulled you may be eligible to recieve a nice unspoken passing thought from me.  Good luck and may the best win.  Few will enter, I will win.
