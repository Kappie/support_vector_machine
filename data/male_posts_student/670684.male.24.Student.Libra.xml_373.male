They're character driven stories that touch so much more than a simple plot, subplot, and cliche theme.    In fact, Barbarian Invasions includes an overtly cliche moment near the end, where the daughter mentions that the first man in a woman's life is her father.  The line sounds like it belonged to Kelli Kopowski rather than the sexy nautalist wearing the stocking cap and enjoying the hell out of life on the high seas in Denys Arcand's incredible realization of preparing for death and life in the interim.    The awareness of weakness in writing would have scared the shit out of me only five years ago.  It actually was a little more than five years ago when I first felt the intrinsic rush of the creative writer.  I sat at my desk area under my lofted bed (it was the greatest work space I ever designed in a room, and am determined to see something similar through when I move into my next adventuresome place), got out the simplest of Bic pens, and wrote  Lighting  (on my other computer...I'll throw it online, how about that).  It was my first poem, the first time that I didn't feel like writing a poem was a trite realization of blackness and hollow feelings.  And it just caught the fuck on, and the class loved it, and people who read it seemed to find what I wanted in it...and there was immediate euphoria.  I was tops in Centenary's creative writing class for Fall 1998...the world was next!    But the memory of my true realization as a writer came that December, or maybe late November, as I sat on the stage in the band shell and wrote  The Last Temptation by Christ , my ode to salvation.  It was a cloudy day, one of the first honestly cold and damp days of the semester.  Most everyone was inside.  But around 4pm or so, there was a break in the rain, the breeze stopped, and it was passably pleasant outside.  And I took my notebook, sat on the shell, and wrote for 45 minutes, just working my ass off to get the stanzas to work in my anapestic pentameter.  It wasn't just pouring thoughts onto a page and center justifying them to give it the faux meaning of 17 year olds who read ee cummings.  It was work.  Every word meant something.  A filler word, an errant syllable, and the poem was ruined.    The poem I turned into Dr. Havird for my final project wasn't any good, and I knew that.  But it moved in the right direction...the work was there, I had poured effort into it, and while to rewrite it correctly would require a complete overhaul, it was a moment of recognition that I understood how people do not just sit down and type out greatness, but greatness is realized, and the work is turning the words into the ubiquitous realization.    So I loved  Barbarian Invasions .  And it made me feel utterly insignificant as a writer.  And I love the feeling.
