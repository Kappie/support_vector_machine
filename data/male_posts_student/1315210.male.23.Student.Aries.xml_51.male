If i had enuff money........i would make it spin faster.........but that would basically be a waste of my money cos it would achieve nuthing for me..........on the other hand.............it's the easiest way to create the world's largest joyride.........  Technically, the world is slightly oval cos of the magnetic fields..........yadda yadda yadda.............
