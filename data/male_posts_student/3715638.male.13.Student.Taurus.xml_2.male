I felt like a guinea pig, they were almost testing me and asking me everything about it. It was strange, but I was kind of glad when it was over. I was getting in a fight with my mouth about the team. I kept saying stuff and she didn't say anything till we got home. I really want to go to Agawam this year for Labor Day. Otherwise, we have to go to North Andover which would be a hotel one. Well, I hope this coming year goes well.
