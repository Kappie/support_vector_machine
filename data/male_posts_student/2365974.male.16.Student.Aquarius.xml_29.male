(i'm so sorry i missed out!!!) grabe. i just wish everyday could be spent like those days. that's what makes summer so likeable maybe. life would be dull without friends.  lessons have been taught and learned this summer. not just inside the classroom, but on the outside as well. yes, there are important things that you'll can learn outside the classroom. there are some things that will be of more importance to those of the things you'll learn inside a classroom.  all those escapades, parties, hang-outs were some of the things that made summer very much enjoyable. yes, classes are out, but the things that made it better was the times spent with the people that means much to you- friends, to be exact. you don't really get to spend as much time as you want with them during the schoolyear.   aaaaaaaaaaaack. so much for that. school starts tomorrow! hahaha
