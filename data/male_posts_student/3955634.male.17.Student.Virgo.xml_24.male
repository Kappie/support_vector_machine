It gets better:   You've been acting mighty rash And talking that trash Let me give you some advice You can crawl back in your hole Like a dirty little mole   And this is the best we can do? I'd encourage people to avoid Charlie Daniels wherever possible; both as a political statement, and for the common good. This shit is  depressing !
