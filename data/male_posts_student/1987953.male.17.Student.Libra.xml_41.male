For those who don't know he is a teacher at my old school  urlLink Baltimore Lutheran School.  He is a funny guy to say the least. Anyway, when you all wake up/get home, tell me about your days (except for Eh Steve, because most likely Steve, being home schooled, did absolutely nothing on this invigorating Monday except woke up late and went on to  urlLink Conglomerate Speech , his new cool forum site that you all should join). Also, it is to be voted on in coming weeks, and I want to see how you all feel: Gay marriages in Maryland? Massachusetts already did it and while the gays feel they have won a victory,  the church believes this is the end to the institution of marriage, and many bishops have been quoted to have said this is a "national tragedy." Comment me! Also read the lyrics below my signature, and if you can, listen to that song. It's a great one! Download it if you have to. I recommend it highly. Anyway, blog ya later!   In Christ, Mike  "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." -Ephesians 2:8-10 NIV    "Everything to Me"  - By Avalon  I grew up in sunday school I memorized the Golden rule And how Jesus came to set the sinner free I know the story inside out I can tell you all about The path that led Him up to Calvary But ask me why He loves me And I don't know what to say But i'll never be the same Because he changed my life when He became...  Everything to me He's more than a story more than words on a page of history He's the air that I breath The water I thirst for And the ground beneath my feet He's everything, everything  to me  We're living in uncertain times And more and more I find that i'm aware Of just how fragile life can be I want to tell the world I found  A love that turned my life around They need to know that they can taste and see Now everyday I'm praying  Just to give my heart away I want live for Jesus So that someone else might see that he is...  Everything to me He's more than a story more than words on a page of history He's the air that I breath The water I thirst for And the ground beneath my feet He's everything And looking back over my life at the end I'll go to meet you saying you've been...  You're everything to me You're more than a story More than words on a page of history You're everything to me You're more than a story More than words on a page of history You're the air that I breath The water I thirst for And the ground beneath my feet You're everything to me Lord, you're everything to me
