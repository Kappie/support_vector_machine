God.. now the kicthen is smelling meat, ew ew ew... the service area is unstading.. i can't stay there for 30 seconds..my mom said that the smell will be good again in 1 day.. that's too much time!  Dad didn't buy the DVD.. i should have known that he wasn't saying the truth.. well.. i'm used to it so i didn't get mad. Let's wait and see of he really buys one.     P.S: Thanks to everyone who gets in here everyweek and try to understand a little bit more of what's my mind.. a special thanks to John, who teaches me my englishes doubts.
