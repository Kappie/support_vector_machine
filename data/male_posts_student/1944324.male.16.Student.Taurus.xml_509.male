You completely annhilated (i spelled that wrong, didn't I?  curse late nights and little sleep!) two of my favorite genres.  Does Silly Songs with Larry count as a musical?  Cuz I understand that Dumbo's out thanks to the AnimationCon and Grease and whatnot is out until MusicalCon or whatever it'll be called...why don't you have a "ChickFlickCon" too so that I'm further lost.  Yet not in translation.  Haha.  I'm hilarious.  Anyway, I still have no idea what movie to bring.  I'm sure Pirates of the Caribbean is taken or all bloggers are exhausted with the stunning performance of Johnny Depp.  But I DON'T KNOW what to bring!  I'll end up bringing a tape-turned-DVD of my 5th grade musical production thing and make ya'll sit through it.  Ha, how'd you like THAT?!  I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.
