Just picture 2,000 elephant seals creating a blubber platform by the ocean, and you're there! Apparently, this is the breeding season for the elephant seals. Our tour guide was cool as well. He knew so much about these seals; how the live, eat, sleep, ect. I mean, they swim up to Alaska to eat, which takes 30 days, and then come back. Now this is REAL amazing, most elephant seals can swim down over 2,500 feet underwater and stay down there for 2 hours! Pretty cool, eh? The amazing thing is that 100 years ago elephant seals were almost extinct and that they made a tremendous come-back, because, well, 2,000 seals is a lot! Me, I don’t normally go to these kinda things, but if I ever have the chance, I’d definitely go there again. If you’re ever are bored, and interested, check out Ano Nuevo to see the seals.     I'll try putting up a pic of some of the seals today or tomorrow.
