Here is what is included in the kit:  1) 11 containers of Blue Foundation Grease Paint (1.25oz each)  2) 5 Bald Caps, 4 Mehron caps and 1 Special Effects cap, all same, and instructions on application.  3) 8oz container of Pros Aide 2 adhesive for Bald Caps.  4) a half empty 1.25oz supply of cabo bondo ridge filler (used to make transition from skin to cap seamless.  Not necessary, but usefull if the glue does not adhere, you can smear some of this stuff on and it acts like bald cap spackle.)  5) 1oz Castor Sealer (used to keep glue from deteriorating)  6) About 12 or 13oz of Pro Face Makeup Remover (in spray bottle)  7) 4oz of No Sweat Skin Prep, in spray bottle (Spray on before greasepaint and after greasepaint is applied, keeps you from sweating too much, great for fat blue men)  8) 4 oz of Invisible UV Makeup, blue (clear when applied, glows blue under blacklights, be sure to work into greasepaint to get good effect)  9) A myriad of rubbing alcohol, brushes, and other things that can be easily purchased at your local supermarket.  There are only 2 things you still have to do to be a blue man.  You have to dye gloves, which is as easy as buying latex gloves and rit dye and mixing the two until you achieve the color you want (ps- wear a pair of regular non dyed gloves under the dyed ones unless you want blue hands), and buying adhesive remover.  Rubbing alcohol works, but buying ben nye makeup remover, putting it in a spray bottle, and using that will make removing any excess adhesive easier on your skin.  Please ask all questions before bidding.  Shipping is $10.00 anywhere in the USA.  Thanks for looking and happy bidding.
