Even though the food kinda sucked, it was worth it to see Kelly flog this guy. And Sounds and Fury is the best group of...anything, ever!  I am now engaged to a 35 year old man. Good times.  Dude, adorable guy in Japanese class rant time. I'm still not completly sure whether my attraction towards him is kosher. I mean, he looks all kiddy, but maybe I'm just a pedophile. Anyways, he is obsessed with orange, which is a shame, but he likes Spongebob, which isn't. He also is very very effeminate, though this could be a prepubescant thing more than a gay thing. All I know is, he's going to be damn sexy one day.  Gab and Ryan are fucking again. Let's all cry. And then cut his hair.  I have ordered all Sandmans in existence. I will soon be locked in my room reading until the end of....me reading Sandman.  Once again, since NO ONE answered my last poll, I ask an all important question. Am I sexy? I think I'm sexy. Do YOU think I'm sexy?   Nostalgia much? Like everything in this post makes me go "..." I mean, its the first mention of me having a crush on Bret! Yowza. And Gab and Ryan are together again. Yowza. I had not read like  any  Sandman? Yowza. And this was around the end of the days where I had a large quantity of engagements. Mega yowza.
