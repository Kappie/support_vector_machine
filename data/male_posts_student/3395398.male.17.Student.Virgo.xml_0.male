My words, My thoughts, My feelings, My unhappiness, My sadness, are sent out with the radio signal. Sent to unknown places, or maybe they are all sent to thin air. Did you hear me? I guess not. They all gone into the thin air.  No matter how long i talked to the walkie talkie. It will forever be dumb. It will only listen but never understand.  When i talked about myseld so much Did you hear me? Did you understand me? I hope it is a "yes" but i know it is a "no"  Another rainy day, i hold my tears and it shed for me. i stand in the rain, nobody can see, i am crying.  Can you hear what I said? I hope so.
