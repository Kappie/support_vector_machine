They only said Jared needed a haircut and they were going to get lunch at Sonny's Barbeque. At first I wasn't going to go, but I did anyway thinking it was going to be quick trip. Then Tyler decided  he  had to go... after finally waking up. That made me a little upset. But I went anyway. Jared got a cut, then we went to lunch, as planned. THEN Mom decided she must go to Staples for Tyler's last school supplies. So we went. Then Leonard (my stepdad) decides he must take an hour and a half at our attourney's office. I hate lawyers. - I got this snazzy USB 2.0 hub that, of course, looks cool with my eMac. But, I'd better not say that... because apparently it labels me as a hipster... Zak. - I'm really considering a new title. If you have any suggestions,  urlLink email me.
