I shall post this little poem I found, which I think is rather good (well, compared to Heaney and Clarke anyway)  I think mice  Are rather nice.   Their tails are long,  Their faces small,  They haven't any  Chins at all.  Their ears are pink,  Their teeth are white,  They run about  The house at night.  They nibble things  They shouldn't touch  And no one seems  To like them much.   But I think mice  Are nice.   wasn't that a good poem?  Anyway, today's rant. As I was walking home from shool, I noticed that the local bus stop had graffiti over the timetable and the glass behind the bench. This graffiti looks awful, and it's even worse as I walk past the bus stop every day, and only a few weeks earlier that glass had been new, because someone had smashed it (youths no doubt). What is the point of graffiti? I really can't see any gain to the offender, as they are risking being caught. They have now totally ruined a bus stop, which will probably take several hundred pounds to replace, comming out of the tax-payers money! This money can then be no longer spent on school or helath supplies. Graffiti is a waste of money, and THERE IS NO GAIN FROM IT!! I really think that if someone is caught vandalising public property they should be made to pay AND fined several thousand pounds. I would also suggest 5 years in jail, if they weren't all full up already. These youths are making the town look horrible, and make it a less pleasant place to live, and most are getting away with it, and if they are caught, they only get a caution!!! I would like someone to tell me why people do this.
