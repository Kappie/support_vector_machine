I thought I'd mention what I've been doing here education-wise. I'm currently trying (and struggling through) to obtain my Masters of Arts in the fields of Public Relations, Journalism and Performance. Quite simply put, it's a combination of Mass Communications (PR  Journo) and English (Drama).  Wot a weird mix,  some of you might think, but that's not necessarily the case. At least, I don't think it is.  You see, I've always been keen on writing work, whether it's journalism or contemporary creative writing. And, as the title of the blog says, I like to make music; that is, I enjoy composing songs, stuff like that. Last year I embarked on my English degree here at Murdoch and discovered the excitement of theatre and live performances, and as such, my aim in my studies is to write an original script suitable for stage performance, and compose songs to accompany the script. In short, I aim to write a musical. That would cover the Performance side of the degree. On top of that, I have to document the entire publicity process: the press releases, the news articles, the interviews, etc. That would cover the Mass Comm side of things. And when you think about it, in trying to promote any sort of event, publicity is the key. Hence from where I'm sitting, Mass Communications and Drama make an interesting and complementary combination. [Meanwhile, I've just reread the above sentences and realised how formal and "academic" they sound. See what happens when you spend too much time writing essays and stuff? Jeez. Sorry about that. Heheh.] __________________________  Anyway, that hopefully explains a bit of what I'm doing educationwise, although most days, when you're in a theatre environment with a whole bunch of loud, extroverted drama and creative writing students, it's hard to remember that it is, at the very heart of it, an education. For those who are interested, I've been involved so far in writing the songs for three shows at Murdoch Uni, two of which were plays aimed at children. I'll post more on these later, but again, when you're interacting with actors who get dressed up in animal costumes and sing songs that sound like a combination of  Bananas in Pajamas  and the pseudo-pop sentimentalities of Disney animations, it's not surprising that you might stop, reflect, and think,  I can't believe I'm doing this for a postgraduate qualification . It's surreal. It really is. If any of you out there are studying with a sense of surrealism as well, drop me a line, let's talk about it. :) Cheers.
