So yea....I have nothing to do....nothing to talk about....I am just really bored....I wrote a couple songs.....I finished  "I Am In Love With A Girl Who Has Narcolepsy" ...the guitar parts and everything...I can't wait to work on that...it's a funny song...I wish I could type the lyrics out on here, but I am afraid some asshole will steal the lyrics.  Me and Mike were hoping to practice today but we couldn't get ahold of Ben....he was with his girlfriend...but he hasn't seen her in awhile and he wont see her till tuesday...so that's ok...  So, I am just running around the house playing with my cat while I blast The Suicide Machines on my computer....I have to admit, in the past couple days I fell in love with the Suicide Machines...They are so great!  You know Nike bought Converse?  Yea, it happened like a week ago....I hope Nike doesn't put a damn nike logo on the chucks....that would look stupid.  Cool...I am slowly finding things to talk about....well....thats all for now I guess....later days!  "I can take a leak in my kitchen sink." -Nerf Herder
