It was getting pretty late, and about halfway through I decided to just fuck it and do it today.  Now, where was I?  Greed is a big part of what punk is, deep down.  But that is not just why I hate it.  Punk fuels a group mentality, one that severely impairs the minds of listeners/subscribers/followers/cult members (it all amounts to the same thing) and in the process drains their wallets.    Want to be a part of the crowd? Can you mountain bike? How about skateboard? Well, do you play guitar or bass?  You see, there is no real room for individuality in the punk subculture.  There is only more of the same (and in this case, the same means shit).  Now, I'm not saying other types of groups don't do the same thing (the "ghetto" culture, for example).  However, even that other horrible subculture has a small glimmer of honesty to it.  Punk has none.  And it does more than just that.    Now, have you ever seen a perfectly nice, awesome guy turned down by a girl (a girl who says that looks don't matter and that she is looking for someone who won't just constantly demand action) because he wasn't "good enough" or "cool enough" (I have personally heard those two nauseating excuses and many more) but then she turns around and starts going after some total asshole because he fits the stereotypical "cool guy" look?  Well, I can rightfully say that you can blame punk for that too!  How the hell does that have to do with anything, you ask?  Well, I'll tell you.    You see, punk puts a labels the type of guys girls should look for (and vice versa).  To get to anyone, you have to be "in". You have to be "part of the crowd".  You have to be "cool".  To be sure, this has the smallest (thin enough to slice your finger off) glimmer of truth.  The very smallest.  But that's where it ends.  Punk takes this and emphasizes it as much as they can, to the point where if you aren't an exact member of the punk movement, where if you aren't perfectly uniform with the rest of them, you are on the outside.  You are left out in the cold.  You miss out on life.    I myself went along with this bullshit for many wasted years of my life.  I never really got it until around 4 years ago, when I met someone who I still hate to this day and will hate until she is dead.  We had met at the beginning of the summer, in early June, and were interested in each other from the first time we met.  For 4 weeks, we were inseparable, until she said something against my religion and I defended it.  This is not what brought about my eternal anger, though.  What did was, when I defended myself, she simply looked at me, said, "I thought you were different", and went on to the next guy like nothing had happened.  I could not say anything to respond to that verbal betrayal of my trust.    Since then, I have mostly accepted my role as the outsider, the loner, the one on the outside looking in.  However, in this past year, I have reopened my wounds (in the ways explained in the "God hates me" article), but there was something I forgot to mention: both girls that rejected me there were avid punk fans.  The one from Nevada was going for me (maybe) ...until I was supplanted by the guys from Washington who are all complete followers of the movement (extreme sports, the whole drill).  Pathetic knows no bounds.  Oh, and as a side note, I relinquish my provision about Nevada being spared.  It can all go to hell too.  As far as I'm concerned, it wouldn't matter if she liked me anyway in the beginning, and it's no use to complain.  The outsider will have his day, and when he does, he will show no mercy.  No mercy for those fools guilty of profiling.  No mercy for the greedy corporations fueling the fires of corruption.  No mercy for punk.
