My mother is mad at me for being a Wicca, which is a completely different story, my family is acting extremely stupid and at the same time I deal with the constant problems of bois.  I will be forward in this journal I am gay.  And there is a guy I like a lot.  He is 36 and I am 16.  Yeah extremely large age difference I know but we have talked for several months and we have built a friendship that is stronger, more deep than that which I have with even my best friend Alison.  It is odd he seriously knows me betta than anyone else.  It is as if he can figure me out see past my fake smile and innocent face when no one else can.  Point is we have flirted a lot lately.  I mean a lot it is upsurd really.  And I have realized age is truly nothing but a number and I want to pursue this only problem is I am scared he doesn't.  Which would mean I could ruin or damage our friendship.  So I have had my friend Katie and Alison helping me out.  I have decided tho to talk to him.  If worse comes to worse I will just eat lots and lots of choclates have an extremely emotional time and have a Buffy marathon.  That always solves my problems.
