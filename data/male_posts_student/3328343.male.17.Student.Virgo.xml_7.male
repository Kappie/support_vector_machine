I would think that he would now have more time to blog now that he is out of school, whatever. Mike's House has been canceled. Thursday night Bible study, canceled until July or something which is a little more reasonable. I started working doing random jobs so I have a little less time to do stuff. It seems like I havn't done anything with anyone since vacation started. What the... there's obviously something wrong here. Sir Thomas Francis Ryan, Duke Bradley Duren, and I will hold a summit tomorrow to discuss these issues and pass a resolution.   In other news, I just realized how great Rise of Nations and The Ataris are awesome. I think we should play Rise of Nations at the LAN party, it really is genius. I'll bring that issue up at the summit tomorrow. Until then my fellow Americans, goodnight.
