At least, I THOUGHT it was today - turns out that it isn't until tomorrow :P  And there weren't any other trials going on today (which I couldn't believe, but 'tis true), so I basically went down there for nothing (although it was helpful to find out where the courthouse was :).  But I think it's kind of ironic that I spent all of last semester working with an attorney in the DC Public Defender's Office and I didn't get to a trial (they have a LOT of them every day over there).  Oh, and it's also ironic that the one case we had last semester that went to trial is going on right now (and my partner is testifying in it :).
