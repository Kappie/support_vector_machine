Oh and by the way, I didn't do anything else today other than that though I still have 2G.P. compres which I'm gonna screw, A book review which I'm gonna cheat at, an econs essay which I can't cheat at and a case study... what's a case study? Urgh... I feel sick and I HATE STUDYING.  I want to sing and have people sing my songs as they listen to the radio every night! I'm meant to do that! Either that, or I'm meant to dream of it. Maybe I'm meant to be an example of a dreamer who lost it all when he chased the impossible. But if you take impossible not as a statement, but a challenge, it won't be impossible.  Speaking of dreams, I had a dream. Guess who boys and girls! YES! Guess who's back, back again. She must be pretty tired after running through my head all day long. It's just that, this dream came to me at 1230pm. I remember, coz daddy asked me what I wanted for lunch, and I mumbled something and fell asleep again. Remember I ran into her at a food place the other day? Well, I was in a cab (later I had a fight with the fat cabbie which involved me calling the police)(and I called 999 with my cell phone and some girl came on and put me on hold! Then a guy came on and told me that if I wanted to call the police, I had to use a public pay-phone)(Funny assed shat). So anyway, the cab stopped right in front of her table at the open aired food place. You know at night.. with one of those big round wooden tables at coffee shops. This table was slightly smaller.  She smiled at me. It didn't say I love you, but it did say I'm happy to see you. Her parents weren't around. But when they returned, I had to go for some unknown dreamy reason and I bid them farewell. They all smiled! I was so happy!  I suppose dreams tell you what you really want. Your innermost desires. I'm afraid to go to camps. It's embarrassing. But if you think about it, is it really? Oh! And from what I've noticed for me, I dream of things that I thought about 2-3-4 days earlier. I think it takes time to get to the subconscious part of your mind.  Think about this, "In a dysfunctional world, being dysfunctional is normalcy". I spoke to Khin. She's special. Funny, sporty, S.M.A.R.T. Her scholarship will take her to New-Mexico. From what I see now, she's definitely the type of person I'd like to know when I grow up. I have to keep the UWC group together.  I'll be sending out a survey to my address book by tomorrow. It's on homosexuality and I'd really appreciate it if YOU filled it out the best you can. It counts pretty heavily toward my OVERALL A-Level grade, so please help me out. Thanks. Later.
