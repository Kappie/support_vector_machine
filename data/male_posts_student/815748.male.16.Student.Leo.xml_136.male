I can never get a straight answer out of either of them.  And I don't know what the crap has been happening with Jing and Kevin, ooOOoohh.  Mr. Stanley said he would let me retake the test over the weekend, and if I got it all right, he would change my test grade to a B+, and maybe make me take the tests I missed.  This isn't exactly what I was hoping for, but at least my grade will improve.  Maybe.  If anybody wants to do anything with Arnaud and me next weekend, like a movie, let me know.
