I woke up at about 11 (extremely early for summer) and did my online work and since then I have sat here and done nothing, partly because it has been raining like a mofo outside and I don't wanna go out in it.  Is it wrong to like the rain?  For some reason I do, I guess because it is a change of pace from the usual sun and hot weather we have here in Georgia.  So last night after I got home I talked to Blair on here for 3 hours (Thank you for staying up until 2:15 with me).  Sounds like she had a nice birthday, which is nice.  And she is probably the only person who has read this thing...hahaha.  My dad said he won't buy me ABB tickets...he is EVIL.  I wish I had a job so I could buy them.  But hey, it's not for lack of trying.  I don't guess I'm doing anything tonight unless Britt does one of the "I'm pulling in your driveway in 10 minutes" kind of things like he has before hahaha.  UGA got eliminated from the College World Series after blowing a 5-0 lead over the best team in the country...ridiculous.  Oh well, only 72 days until football season.  I can't think of anything else to say right now, so I'll write more later.
