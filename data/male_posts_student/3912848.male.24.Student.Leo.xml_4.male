I think it is in part our deep-seated need to confess our wrongs.  The blog allows this, though I'm not yet sure it's the best way to confess.  Of course, I know that the confession that  matters  is confession to God.  He's the one to whom we need to be reconciled.  I think that the blog can be a good supplement, though it should certainly not be a substitute.   I am a fairly prideful person and not very open to sharing faults, so I don't suppose there will be much confessing from me on this page.  Any confession will probably be cloaked.  Time will tell.    I do know that for those of us receiving the confessions, we owe the confessor a proper response;  true concern, forgiveness, humor (at the right time and to the right degree), and prayers.
