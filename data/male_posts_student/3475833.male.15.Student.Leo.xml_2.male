That's the rule of the house. Well, he thinks he doesn't have to go to church so he spend the whole time complaining, which gets my dad mad, which gets my mom mad, which snowballs into a horrible day. Oh well, I'll live... Well, Maybe not. More problems in the distance.  Okay, The near future. Apparently something broke on the pool, a little strap that helps the pool form. No biggie, go get a new peice slip it on... Everything's gravy, right? Hell no. As we are checking the strap to make sure it'll survive, I get wet. Now, I didn't fall it, it's not raining, and no one splashed me. How'd I get wet? A hole. A hole in the side of this "nearly indestructable" pool. Oh yeah, GREAT FUN. Let the cuss words start flying from my dad's mouth. So, they (my parents) stormed off to the pool place to get replacement stuff. So, I'm sure I'll spend most, if not all, of the day fixing that. Sorry Alyssa.  Whoa Whoa Whoa, Sorry Alyssa, how does that fit in there? Let me explain. Alyssa has been harrassing me to come and eat her pizza. No sexual inuendo intended. She wants to prove to me that she can cook without burning herself, or the house. And prove that she doesn't break things when she cooks. So, I'd like to go over, regardless if it's for pizza or not. But as of right now, the option doesn't look good.  Bleh, I really hope this day goes good. I also need to go to the mall and buy a book, because I hope to finish Bloody Bones by today or tomorrow. It's been a great book, I recommend the WHOLE series to anyone who is insteressted in books about vampires and the such. I dunno, I'm so confused. I really need to organize thoughts each and every morning.
