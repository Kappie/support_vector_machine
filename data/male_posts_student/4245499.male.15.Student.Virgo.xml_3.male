I'm alone on the internet with my computer and the chair is blocking the door to my room. STOP RIGHT THERE, YOU DIRTY BITCHES! No I was not doing that looking at.. stuff! I was bored.. everyone went to sleep.. I was about to read The Sun Also Rises. I decided to check on my dream girl on ratethisasian.com and see if she was keeping her position on the top 25 list! On this page there were pictures of pretty girls.. and girls that are HALF-naked. Ok the chair was there, because me and tommy were gonna play games on the floor, and moved the chair out of the way. And it ended up there. So anyways, I am a guy.. and chose to look at one of these half-naked girls... ALL OF A SUDDEN MY DAD WALKS IN.. and I get startled! And turn around! HE LOOKS AT ME.. AND THEN THE SCREEN.. oh shit! THIS IS NOT PORN.. "Oh wtf! A pop-up! Don't you worry, father. This shit happens all the time! I just have to click this button here to make it dissappear..." "Jimmy, why do you look at dirty things? It is bad stuff, you like bad stuff? You dirty boy?? You dumb dirty boy!" Ok it didn't happen quite like that. It was an array of akward stares... But you got the idea right? Anyways, I figure this happens to a lot of cool guys out there.. and this helps me minimize my embarrasment. In fact, I know believe that I am totally innocent... I AM YOUR TYPICAL TEENAGE KID.... I have not done a crime here.. it is a crime done against me! Who's with me! HUH??? WHO'S WITH THE WALRUS?   And that's my time... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.
