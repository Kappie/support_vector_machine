So here are my long term and short term goals, enjoy being bored :-)  Long Term: Gain Weight, work out, straight A's in school, SAT I  II prep. Build vocabulary Practice Guitar everyday  Short Term: Learn Calculus, German, Finish Summer HW by Aug 18, Gain weight  Well i'm a boring guy, leave me the f alone ;) And here are the lyrics to Ill Nino - This Time's For Real. Kick ass song :)    Why do you tell me all these lies?  I just want to live my life  I don't want to leave my dreams behind  Tell me  Why am I only getting older?  My patience getting shorter  I'm running out of time  And I hope that I get what I wanted   This time's for real  Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?   This time's for real  Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?   Why do you make me feel denied?  Always pushing me aside  You do not decide what's wrong or right  Tell me  Why am I feeling so much pressure?  Am I searching for the answer?  I'm running out of time  And I hope that I get what I wanted   This time's for real  Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?   This time's for real  Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?   This time's for real  Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?   This time's for real  Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?   Is there anything I wanted?  Is there anything I needed?  Anything at all?
