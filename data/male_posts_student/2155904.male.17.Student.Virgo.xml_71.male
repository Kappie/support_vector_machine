Monday came in with a "Reeee-errrrrr...reeeee-errrrr!!!"  That was the sound of his alarm clock and not the winsome wail of the big red fire engine.  He lumbered out of bed and drained his MW in the broom before going back and making his bed (if ya really wanna know what MW is then ask him but be warned).  Well after he got to school he went over to Skippy's car and ended up just sitting there.  They didn't really even talk but it was warm in there so they didn't need to.  Then Tyke got out when the bell rang and he had told Macaroon that he would bring a tennis racket for him to use in physics and give it to him in the morning.  Well Macaroon wasn't there so he just decided to leave it leaning up on the side of the car next to Macaroon's spot.  Then Tyke walked with Tina to math class as usual and they chatted and played games and such (yeah) and then he walked with her after class as usual and then he went to second period.  He and Kinker and Triple Threat talked and shtuff.  Then he left that period to go meet up with Purdy and walk with her to 3rd.  Well he talked to Macaroon on the way there and Tyke asked him if he got the racket.  And Macaroon was like, "oh that was for me?"  He said that he had told Dr. Phil in the morning that "oh somebody left a racket there next to his spot."  Tyke immediately went into "ARE YOU F*ING KIDDING ME?" mode to make sure Mac realized he was a moron.  He got the point and at lunch he gave the racket he got after 3rd period and gave it to Tyke.  So at least he didn't lose a racket too.  He already lost his bball on Friday.  Well 3rd and 4th periods were great cuz they entailed not doing shit.  Just talking girl talk with Purdy and Dottie.  Ya know, the use.  Tyke is such a girl, its hilarious!  Ahhh, good times, good times.  But seriously folks, good times.  After school Tyke did nothing again.  Came home and after a while he talked to Karla.  They talked for most of the night really.  They started doing would you rather's and Tyke came up with an insanely good one.  Here it is: would you rather go through an entire 24 hours in the body and mind of your biggest crush ever or have your biggest crush ever go through an entire 24 hours in your body and mind?  Good, ain't it?  And all Tyke's idea really.  He realized post-delivery that it sorta resembles Being John Malkovich but this is different still.  More like being Tina Tight-shirt.  Well actually it would be Tina being Tyke.  Cuz that is how he would pick it.  For her to go inside him for a day and find out how he truly feels around her and all of that kind of shizz.  Not that it would change her thinking-well it isn't possible anyway-but it would at least open her eyes to being more sensitive about things.  Tyke talked to Dr. Phil also during the night and they ended up getting on the subject of how it is hard when you like someone and they don't like you back.  Tyke immediately said, "TELL ME ABOUT IT!!!"  Haha, that was funny.  Then he progressed to recant his list of lady-friends he had been seriously enveloped in but to no avail.  Here is the list: 1st and 3rd grade Karla.  4th grade Carmen O'Neill.  5th grade Haras.  6th grade Haras and then Rachel.  7th Rachel.  8th Ali.  9th-present Tina.  It is a solid list right there.  Some great gals on it.  But if your name is not on the list, don't worry, you are still most likely a great friend of Tyke's but he just can't be all out there liking everyone now can he?  This blog is sorta disappointing to him because compared to the last couple of days it is not that long and Tyke himself loves to read long blogs.  But he has run out of things to say.  OH!  He just remembered how he was talking to Dr. Phil about blogs and how Tyke is good at his.  Then Tyke said Dr. Phil should have an Asian blog, or XANGA, and the doc said that he couldn't cuz it wouldn't be interesting to read nor would it accomplish anything.  But anyway they both agreed that Tyke's blog was just his diary.  And then Tyke realized that he is a girl.  He keeps a diary and talks about the opposite sex all the time.  And gets all sentimental and shizz.  And not to mention the fact that he posts it all over the internet and even put his blog up on a site to rate it (which by the way was a total failure to do since none of the votes are being counted for some reason).  But he also realized he doesn't care.  Cuz that is just the kind of person he is.  And it allows for some humorous moments.  Like his singing.  It is always loved by everyone.  How many people feel comfortable enough to just start singing songs to anyone around?  Or how many people have the balls to just flat out tell their MONSTER CRUSH how much they think about him/her and all of that stuff you already know?  Not many.  Tyke is one of a select few.  Be proud you know him.  Be proud you read his blog.  And most importantly remember...don't worry...be happy.  Tear...
