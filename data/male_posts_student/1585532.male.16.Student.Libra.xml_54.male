Girl, 6, thrown from Sizzler, injured   Anyways, it made me think of the restaurant, and I then started writing up my own article....Here's the result..    Girl, 6, thrown from Sizzler, Injured   	Six year old Jamie Forester was thrown from a Sizzler last Saturday.  As of this time, investigators are unsure as of what actually caused the ejection.  The Sizzler, opened May 10th, 1998, seems to be in working condition, and hasn't had any reported problems. Several eye-witnesses saw the little girl tossed from the Sizzler, and say it was her fault.  	"She only tipped the waitress 2 dollars," says Arnold Weight, an eye witness, "she should have tipped her at least 4, she was under the gratuity percentage."  	Other witnesses say a piece of cheese bread was at fault for her being thrown from the Sizzler.  DOSH has requested the Sizzler to stop the sale of all cheese bread until they can inspect it for any faults that may have lead to the ejection.  	The family has not released any information of legal charges they may be pursuing at this time.  The Sizzler remains open, selling quality meals at reasonable prices.
