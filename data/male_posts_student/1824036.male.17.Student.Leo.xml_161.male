Somebody (who could kick my ass) didn't quite yield and we almost hit each other...so I honked just in case he didn't see me...  He must not have liked it. He slammed on his breaks and made a HUGE screeching noise. I kept driving (faster of course). His backup lights turned on and he started to go in reverse. I kept speeding up, knowing I was no match for the smoking, beer drinking, bad ass of a man that was pursueing me.  He put it back in drive and tore around the block trying to find us. I freaked out and drove to the local Fareway and walked inside so he couldn't really beat me up without causing a  HUGE  scene. I didn't see or hear from him the rest of the night.  Now for the real test. I see him in the halls tomorrow once or twice by just casual walking by...I dont know if he knew it was me, but we will see. If he does then there is going to be a rumble tomorrow. And I dont fight much and dont like to fight too much...so Im either gonna get laid out or summin.  We will see if maybe he killed enough brain cells last night smoking dope or not to remember the confrontation that we had. I will blog later about this (maybe saturday).  I have a track meet tomorrow, its gonna be a BIG ONE. Conference meet!!
