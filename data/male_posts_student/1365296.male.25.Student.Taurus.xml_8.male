Let's hope the South Koreans have more guts and sense than the idiotic Spanish.  The worst thing that could happen is for South Korea to hand another victory to the terrorists.  I can only hope and pray the Korean those bastards are holding somehow makes it out alive, but the chances are slim.  These people don't negotiate despite what they say.  I wouldn't be surprised if they killed the man anyways even if South Korea decides to leave the coalition.  These are the kinds of people (I use the term loosely) they are.  They don't care.  Its simply an excuse.  I may have my disagreements with the war and how it was handled, but its situations like this that convince me that the fight must go on.
