My uncle's family is travelling to Malaysia and am going with them too.It would be my first visit to Malaysia.                                  Life is Strange.Incidentally my interview at IIM-Indore is Scheduled for this Saturday.Of course I would not be attending it since I have already commenced my MBA here in Singapore in a very good B-school. But then , if someone had told me a few years ago, that on the day of my IIM (Indian Institute of Management) Interview , I would be Travelling in Malaysia , I would have called them crazy. I now realize nothing can be more crazier than fate !
