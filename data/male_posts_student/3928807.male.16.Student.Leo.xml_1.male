Then after lunch we were doing something else, but I got pulled aside to help put up a sheet of paper that covered an entire wall so our group could paint a mirale on it at 2:00. That was a tiny bit stressful but overall okay. They pained for an hour, and then we were basically done. The kids behaved pretty well today - it might have helped that one of the worst kids wasn't there. Nicholas is still my favorite camper. Or did I say that Evan was? Whatever. I signed up for a potluck on Thursday and I have to bring fruit. There's going to be alchohol there, butI don't know how strict they're going to be with letting underage people drink (hopefully not very). Anyways, the day was alot less stressful than yesterday.  It still rains everyday. It's miserable. I'm too tired to do anything tonight.
