At that point, your treacherously "tratorial" nature had already been remarked upon. Hence, no need to reiterate; redundancy is a time waster. The ascription of "Paully" was meant to disparage your apparent shouting that, not the British, but the Bloggers are coming. What I meant by this has since been nullified after talking to Brendan. Apparently he found Misreadings all on his very own. Yet, based on his  urlLink article  of last night where he identified you as my arch-nemesis, I assumed you had got on the horn and started yelling "Have you seen Winner's blog? Have you seen that it completely bites your own in both style and content?" (cf. the "in consultation" sentiment of aforementioned Terrain Cognita posting). Obviously, this misreading can only serve as an index of my own shame at being lazy and biting another's style. Perhaps a battle only to be fully reconciled on the 6x6--cardboard confrontation, my man--rock it steady.   As it turns out, you did no such thing. I suppose these types of misunderstandings take place when one is in involved in gangland warfare. Yet the question remains, how did Brendan intuit our rivalrous stance toward one another? Red vs. Blue? Burnt Sienna vs. Aqua Marine? Has word spread so fast along the UofC pipeline? Paranoia is compounding daily.
