It also there for takes a while to get you into the movie. The intro is kinda cool but it feels kinda disjointed to me. Probably just because I'm used to modern movies - though Citizen Kane was good.     urlLink Everything you wanted to know about sex*  *but were afraid to ask   (5/10 value for money)  I've only watched part of this but the first part i saw was rather boring, but the second part was pretty funny, so I will have to wait and see if it's goo(d).    urlLink Tigerland   (7/10 value for money)  It has Colin Farrell, and it has his screen test. Perfect.    urlLink Jamelia's Thank You   (8/10 value for money)  I LOVE Superstar, Thank You and See it in a Boy's Eyes. From the singles (those just listed) you'd think it was RnB / Pop, but it's more RnB... it's crazy. It's like expecting Celebrity and getting Justified.     urlLink Ministry of Sound's Sessions One   (13/10 value for money) WOW. This is why I impulse buy CDs incase i find something like this. Great mix of songs, great songs, mixed well. anyways i love it. It has all of the singles i was thinking of buying... well about 5 anyways. It's up there with This is me... Then and D-D-Don't Stop The Beat.   Two singles  (8 / 10 value for money) Both pretty good. Counting crow's accidentilly in love and Janet's all night.
