Found that actually those which-are-assumed-to-be homeworks like tutorials are not important. What's more important is actually the common test = midyear exams... Two days to get 6 subjects is equals to 1/3 day per subjects! hahaha.... But this exam is really important to me coz if i don get at least a D grade for all my A level subjects, i'll have to drop one... which actually not important but i had worked really hard to get that 4 a level subjs...   Not quite confident in this coming exams... downloaded lotz of songs this afternoon! All nice ones.. popular chinese pop songs. :) Whole day reading bio notes and watching tv.. sian ah... how i wished i can go Northpoint or Orchard Road with delp, kairong, koonjin... It's really relaxing and keeps my day busy. Days seemed long alone at home.. Don't feel like studying... weather so hot. haha.. wasted another day again....! Tomorrow muz muz muz muz study le!
