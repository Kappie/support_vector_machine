I finally had Turkish coffee. It was fun hanging out.   Having the coffee made me realize that probably one of the most useful classes I've ever had as an undergrad is Topik's history of coffee course. There's the whole knowledge / academic part where you learn about the world via one commodity; however, perhaps the best part is that the history of coffee is just interesting especially since you drink the stuff. I liked the Turkish coffee. It seemed a bit gritty, but it was good coffee.  I've got to go grocery shopping today... here comes the crappy produce.  ***
