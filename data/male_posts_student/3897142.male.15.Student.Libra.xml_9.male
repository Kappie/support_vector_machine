I suppose you think I think I know it all Nobody hears the things I sayI guess that nobody cares My head's so full of things I set my mind free of them I'm breaking the rules Breaking all the rules Can't you see they're nothing without you? Empty heads full of fools Now you see, I'm breakin' all the rules (breakin' all the rules) Well, I know that you would love to go to heaven But you know that you're just too afraid to die And I know that you would love to know the answers But to you the truth is just another lie Nobody hears the things I sayI guess that nobody cares My head's so full of things I set my mind free of them I'm breaking the rules Breaking all the rules Can't you see they're nothing without you? Empty heads full of fools Now you see, I'm breaking all the rules (breaking all the rules)
