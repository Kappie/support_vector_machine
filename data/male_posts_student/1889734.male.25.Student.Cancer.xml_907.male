Then I stopped to consider what I had just done.  A beheaded body has become another mundane report.  Kidnappings and executions in the name of Allah has sunk to the same level as the latest labor dispute in Europe.  Maybe I need to go find the Nick Berg tape again and remind myself what this means, and why we are fighting over there (or maybe not, since some believe that the entire war was strictly for WMDs....never mind that the WMD argument was only trotted out to get the UN onboard, in deference to the multi-national crowd.  It never really mattered, and for the record, I still believe Saddam had them, or was very near building them despite the sanctions.  But that's another post...).
