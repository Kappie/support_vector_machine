Coz before tat, around 3pm....i had sake sushi with my church fren.....Was really kind of full.... but even before tat, went to catch a movie with my church fren, Harry Potter  the Prisioner of Azkaban.....Then after lunch, went off to meet wei ci  dennis at bugis in a arcade centre.... Watch them play some sort of a card game football, was really interesting though.... Then after tat, we took a train to pasir ris, there we wait for another fren of us, Emily, before going over to the chalet there for BBQ. Not mani of us went to the BBq.... then most of us who were there were just talking to one another abt their schools or work. Some of us didn't ate much there, while others like kenji, roche  edward were eating alot of stuff, Guss they are realy hungry...... But everyone started leaving the place like around 10+pm.... hmmm.... but i guess it was good gathering though mani other didn't came.... i still got to see my other good frens....
