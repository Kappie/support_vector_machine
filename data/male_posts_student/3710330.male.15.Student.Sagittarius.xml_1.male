Mr Vorilhon, who calls himself Rael, claims a space alien visiting him in 1973 revealed that extraterrestrials had created all life on Earth through genetic engineering.", excerpt from Straits Times, Thursday,June 24 2004, article on  "Cloned baby? Science shows its snake oil."  For what I feel, this guy is definitely a crackpot to me. Having seen an extraterrestrial is strange enough, having spoken to one and even being able to speculate on issues of mankind is seriously out of this world. I wonder why they still allow him to continue his theory on such inane claims, they should put him in a mental asylum if you ask me.  "In a not-too-distant future, advanced cloning technologies will allow us to even recreate a deceased person in an adult body, with all his past experiences and memories, allowing mankind to enter the age of immortality as it has been announced by His Holiness Rael founder of Clonaid, in 1973 alread, after his contact with the Elohim, mankind's extraterrestrial creators," the company said.  They seem to be trying to create another 'The 6th Day", which remains as a scientific fantasy. I am not surprised that they were met with great scepticism, for they seriously need some polishing to work on with their minds to be able to believe in Mr. Vorilhon.
