The flight went well and there were no delays J. We got into the Ontario airport and the first thing I noticed before we actually landed was all the SMOG in the air. It was really bad… nothing compared to Phoenix! The airport itself was busy. Luckily we didn’t land in the LAX airport. We got our rental car and drove out to have some lunch. We went to this restaurant called “Tokyo Lobby” and the food was alright but the service was horrible. The last time I was there (a year ago), it was a lot better (both food quality and service).  Well, then we went to my Godmother’s wedding. It was a great one. The actual wedding, which took place in the church, was about an hour and then there was a reception after the wedding. We spent about 5-6 hours at the reception and it was really fun. We danced and you should’ve seen me… I was WILD! Then, right before I was about to leave, the DJ picked my Dad and I to do the YMCA with 3 other guys (1 of them being Groom). Haha and I had the time of my life… I was entertaining everyone! I had a great time and after all that hassle through the airport and stuff, it was all worth it. In fact, I just got back from the reception! 4 hours after the reception, the bride and groom are off to Rome for a couple weeks!  Besides going to the wedding and seeing the Bride and Groom, I met a lot of people from the church we used to go to all the time. I’ll post some pictures soon and will show you some pictures of the wedding. That’s all for today! Tomorrow we have planned a lunch with my sister and her boyfriend. That’ll be fun. Otherwise, that’s all I have for tomorrow. I’ll let you know how it goes!
