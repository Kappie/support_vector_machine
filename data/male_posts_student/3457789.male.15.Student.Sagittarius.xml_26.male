While i swayed, weak, trembling and alone,  the everlasting arms held my own.  My burdens did the Lord Almighty help me bear,  while generously showering His tender loving care.    Despite all of my immense pain and sorrow,  even though i am left without a purpose or aim,  Iknow for a fact that yesterday, today and forevermore,  My Lord God will be the Same!    -------------------------------------------------------------------    Dear restless heart,  dont moan and be sorrow so.  Be still! for peace is found just by looking at His smile.  He has a meaning for the chilly winds that blow.    Just hope, and hope and hope,  until in Him you braver grow.  God is always there! He will never, ever flee!  Just pray, and pray, and pray till' you have faith to see!  ------------------------------------------------------------------    Everything seems so so bleak,  "I'll put my trust in him",  my bruised heart faintly murmured,  as over me rolled a huge crushing boulder of woe.    I am singing without the sound of melodious music,  without the sound of tuneful strings.  I am crushed and defeated but i will continue to trust  and ride on his caring wings.
