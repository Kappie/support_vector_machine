I just thought of the idea today that I'd document what Counter-Strike is all about.  Most people, like parents, don't know much about the game.  I figure it'll show people how constructive it can be.  I don't know if I'll be bias towards one side or another but I'll try to just tell it like I see it.  I don't know how it'll go but we'll see.
