There’s no room for individualism there. They don’t like revolution. Sit. Kneel. Obey. You don’t like the idea of it all. I know you still believe in God. I know you still feel guilty in the middle of the night, while laying there awake, looking back on all the thing you’ve done. I know you still believe enough not to say there is no God. You know there is a God. However, religion, like all things, is man-made. This is what you believe, isn’t it? And so, if it’s man-made, how can it be perfect? How can it be true?  Once, you were so strong there. So much passion. So much love. Now what have you got? So much hate. So much rage. Apathy. Lethargy. All of that. And more. Or less. You hate organized religion. I know you do; I can feel it in you. The councils. The education.  The politics. They’re not better there than anyone else in the world. They’re not any better. No, organized religion is not for you. Or for anyone, really. That’s just what they’re adjusted to. The world hates change.  I know you still need to worship. So you occasionally go back there, to their building, to their House of God. You go to celebrations, like Christmas, like Easter. And you still go a few Sundays a month. It can’t ruin you that way. I know, because I’ve seen it. I’ve seen you sitting there, reflecting quietly in your room. Your faith is pure there, with no one else around. No priest and his message. No Vatican Voodoo. Nobody with a show put on, singing, dancing, praying, just so everyone can see them and say “Boy, are they ever a good Christian”. No. Maybe your faith isn’t as strong as theirs. But then again, it might be, because it’s true.  Sincerely, Yourself    urlLink  postCount('nov32002');
