Fortunetly I barely had any homework, so that's why I drummed so long and now I'm gonna watch a movie on the new downstairs dvd player with my papa. I can do it. I can do it 9 times. Told you I'd put a homestar quote at the end of every blogger entry...wait it's not at the end... I can do it. I can do it 9 times.
