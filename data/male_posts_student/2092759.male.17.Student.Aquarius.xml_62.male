I didnt do any of the homework, and I didnt feel like just showing up, taking the test and then leaving without turning in anything so I just stayed home, in theory to do my homework. Of coarse, because the nephew is over, I never got around to doing my homework before or after I had to head over to the High School for band practice. It went preety well, all things considered. Basically the section leaders learned what marching techniqes were going to be using with our new Marching Tech/Assistant Band Director/Brass Instructor/etc.., etc.., Dan Zillinger (Sorry, If I spelt that wrong...), then we sat down and went over some new pep tunes for next year.   Today we (meaning Me, because im single, bored and lonely) will begin to bring you a short character evaluation of Comic Book legends. The ten most complex, layered and well written characters in the medium. Everyday for the next ten days, Im going to go down the list and write between a paragraph and "Only god knows how long" on the particular character, in addition to my already riviting and moving moments of online goodness. The profiles begin tommorrow with our number ten character,my favorite gangster from any form of literature (Take that and cram it in your Cannoli, Don Corleone) Alberto Falcone, from the seminal, unappreciated Jeph Lobe/Tim Sale Batman peice, The Long Halloween.
