Today I clean up the pad and washed mimi's car, had some chinese food, took a walk over by the SSU campus pond and filled up my car with gas. Then we drove up the small mountain range behind my house to find the Fairfield Osborne Preserve. I was just curious as to where exactly it was. They only do guided tours of the area but even the drive up there was super wild. After that I worked at the bookstore and that was blah.  DO IT NOW!   current mood:  predatory current music: Soul Coughing - Sugar Free Jazz
