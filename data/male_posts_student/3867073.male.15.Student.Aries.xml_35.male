       
      This is my first blog, and my first blog post. I was finding myself wanting to do so many things and having lots of great ideas, so I decided to use a blog instead of paper (it crumples too easily) or a whiteboard (I don't have one!). I will review my day sometimes, but mostly random ideas that I won't have to remember. If I don't make a post for a while, either I am way too busy to post but should to unload mental cargo, or I am not needing to put ideas in a place where I can come back to them because I can act on most of them immediately. My mind goes in cycles like that. I happen to be at a peak in mental productivity and am consumed by various commitments right now; that is why I started this blog. I have tried rigid calendars and to do lists before, but random thoughts just don't have a spot there. If I have any more random thoughts regarding the topic of my blog, I will randomly post them.
