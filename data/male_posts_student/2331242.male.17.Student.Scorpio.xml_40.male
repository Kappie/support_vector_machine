The whole place had a certain  alive  feeling that W and Davidson were lacking. The campus was big, beautiful, and up-to-date. W wasn't. Davidson was kinda in the middle. So I suppose the visits were all worthwhile. I found out lots of good information, but also came to a disturbing revelation that I had been protecting myself from. Computer Science is a really frickin hard major, and it involves a lot of math. Anyone who knows me knows that: A) I suck at math, and B) I am a slacker So I've been thinking..... How about a major in spanish and a minor in music? Those are the two things that I'm really good at and enjoy. Then, after I get whatever degree in those things, I could do some sort of technology job training, the type that doesn't involve the ultra-complicated-inner-workings-of-the-computer stuff. All that really ever interested me was programming and graphics (websites, photoshop, games, etc.) With a degree in spanish that would include appying it to the business world, I would be pretty appealing to any employer. I'll keep the minor in music because it's something that I love to do and that I don't want to just drop. Maybe I'll make a little extra money from it in the future. Who knows.  I want to see my girlfriend again. When she gets back I swear I'm just going to attach myself to her and never let go.  I bought UT 2004. Something's messed up w/ my Alienware. I have double the recommended RAM and a 3.06 ghz p4, and the thing still has incredibly slow load times. What gives? And the lag, as with any conquest-type FBS, is atrocious. Oh well, the game got excellent reviews. Hopefully, they'll release a patch or something that speeds it up to a comforatable level. I need to find something to do to burn up the rest of my energy.
