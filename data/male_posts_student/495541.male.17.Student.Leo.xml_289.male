It was probably just the weather.  Planted some flowers in the front yard today.  That was exciting.  There were ants everywhere.  I think I might have gotten bit by one on my right elbow.  It was weird stuff.  I don't like having dirt under my fingernails.  That is annoying.  I need to be getting to bed now.  I have the last full day of my junior year tomorrow.  I'll post a picture now of the car I hope to purchase as soon as I get a job.  Do me a favor and don't buy that one.  They have 4 others you can pick from at the lot.
