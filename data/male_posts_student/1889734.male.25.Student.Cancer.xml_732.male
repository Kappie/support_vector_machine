It was good - quite entertaining - but not 'changemylife' good, which is what I (unfairly) expect from anything recommended by the EB's.  (The same thing happened when I watched 'The Ring'. )   I'm sure part of the impact is seeing it on the big screen.  I verily enjoyed the ending, though - a swashbuckling smirk from Aubry that pleads for a sequel.    What is it that makes this a better than average movie?
