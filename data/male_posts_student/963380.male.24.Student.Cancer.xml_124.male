I used to own one, which I sold to Johnny Wise a few years back, due to lack of use. "Why do I want a new Mp3 player?" (accurate usage of qvotatcions!) you ask? I want a new Mp3 player because it's an iPod. Yeah, an iPod. I've always had a soft spot for Mac technology (that's a bold faced lie - I used to loathe macs with a passion. Shortly after, I hit puberty and grew the hell up) - Hell, I'd trade my mom for a fully loaded G5 (seriously, is she *really* that necessary?) so this iPod thing has really tickled my fancy. I'm going to cease all extraneous purchases until I have the funds to buy one. I'm starting today by putting $20 in a jar, hopefully my dad won't decide it's another levy that he imposed and forgot about (he's worse than the Mayor Quimby during a visiting film production).  So yeah, the 15 GB iPod is $599 retail, it's got a rechargable battery, belt clip, headphones, dock, the whole shebang. The 10 GB one would suffice at $469, but it doesn't come with all the goodies. God damn, if I'm going to buy over $400 worth of gadget, I wan't the full fucking monty. Needless to say the 30 GB model is waaaaay overkill, after all, 15 GB gives you 3750 songs of average length (you there, the one giggling, grow up). 15 GB worth of Mp3s means I really have to jump on the piracy bandwagon. In FACT, you might say that litigious behaviour of the Recording Industry Artists of America is *precisely* why I have returned to downloading illegal mp3's as well as sharing my own collection online. It would be nice if there were a more impactful way to stick it to this particular man. As it stands I doubt I'll buy many CD's ever again. There are the obvious ones, The Dave (tm), anything they manage to slap The Beatles or Elvis on (contrary to popular belief (aka Quentin Tarantino) you CAN be both an Elvis man and a Beatles man. Living proof here. Other than the big few though, I won't be buying much. Certainly not their bubblegum flavour of the week.  The second facet to this whole iPod thing is that I don't own a stereo. Well I do, technically, but none of the ones I have now are for listening to music. I think I'm going to get a very subtle set of speakers and hook the iPod up to them in my room. It's got an alarm clock function - that means I could wake up to Iron Maiden, as opposed to the Christian Bible Hour (you think I'm joking? The LAWD woke me up this morning). Yeah, that'd be hot.  Run to the Hills indeed.
