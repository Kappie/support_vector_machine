Expected the aftermaths of yesterday's incident, which i wouldn't mention here, to happen today, but nah....yay~ I'm still happy, what'cha gonna do 'bout it? And well...I will wait. What do I mean? It's none of your buisness, but the person I'm referring to would understand, although I doubt she would take the time to read me blog :P      Can't believe that Xin Mei and Sili thinks that I should be sad...hmmm....why shud I? Sorrow only brings pain...yay...So I see it from a good direction. Can't blame me, I'm still da optimistic freak~    Okie...so what happened today? I'm not gonna explain it in details...we had a hard science test afta skool and after it we head to da Bball court for a day of Bball...a trio came down and wanted to play...and yeah, we did. The tallest one seemed AWFULLY familiar but I cud not remember who's him. Well well, we(En Kai, Zhao Kai, Me) lost to a 7-4, which in chinese...has a pronouncation of "go and die".      Bah..who cares...afta the game the tall one lik...keep diaoing us...I kept quiet bout it...then another person cum... I heard the tallde complain to that guy...who in turn challenged us to ANOTHER game...man...life's tired...but fun :P. I think that the tall one diao us b'coz...I lik...keep blocking him out from the...erm..."Red Area".... then no matter how hard he pushes I just stay there....Ayah...since he lik bueh song le...I lazy blk him oso...it was 5-7...yay...another loss for us....    Donno why...the tzll one knows that i dwwn go blk him...or maybe juz coincidence lah... Then he asked for another match...which we won in 11-10...yay...      Fun day overall..worsened my right leg's blister s ...left leg new blister... then my right leg de toe nail lik falling off le...but I still wun care...         ~!~ hApPy mE ~!~ ~+~ I aM tYcO...hEhE ~+~ ~-~oFfIcIaLly dEcLaReD cOnTeNtEd~-~ ~/~ i WiLl wAiT dE...i rEaLlY wILL de.... ~\~
