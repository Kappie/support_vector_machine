We woke up at 9 and were out to the skatepark at 10, we stopped by Cassandra's house on the way, and I saw her for about an hour. After Cassandra's we got to the park and skated there for a while, I was mainly focusing on the 1'6" box and the rails, and I learned a new trick, a fakie-backside flip. I had plenty of time to practice it because Richie fucking ditched me for two hours. I was so pissed off I would have punched him in the face, but he said he would, and did get me a pack the next day. We got a ride to my house and slept here. (Sunday) Jon came over at 10 and we [Jon, Richie and I] went to the new skatepark, one word, IT SUCKED... yeah it's two words... buuut. When I got back to my house Janette, Eric and Mike were in my pool, it was weird. We met Cassandra and Darlene up at St John's church, and hung out there for a while, it was all going good with Cassandra at that point. We all went to my house, and hung out and ate EVERYTHING. My house, is food-free, but everyone got along well, so it was cool. We ate: Two large pizzas, waffles, sausages, popcorn, crouton things, poptarts... everything; the more I think about it, the hungrier I get :). Jarred came over too, we walked to convenient and Cassandra and Mike [my bestfriend] were hanging all over eachother, holding hands hugging or having their arms around one another... we went back to my house to get our boards and go to the mall. On the way to the mall, Janette, Eric and Jarred [Jarred just followed them and didn't even know them, he's so stupid sometimes] went ahead, and the rest of us got a call saying that everyone's rides were on their way, so they went to the mall, not known to them that we weren't going. At my house I was pissed at Cassandra and wouldn't tell her why so I just ignored her for a while, I kissed her by though, but she didn't get any tongue. Everyone left at 8, but Janette, Eric and Jon stopped by at 9, and Jay and Eric left, Jon's still here and it's 9 30 on a school night... my parents are going to yell at me because of it. I'll talk later... fat kids rides still not here, so I'm going to wait for it with him. Later.
