It's never that I don't want to write...a trip to Georgetown to play cheap golf at Southwestern University inspired a dearth of blog topics, but I was far from computer, and ten hours later the spirit no longer subsided.    I ended up pretty defeated a few weeks back...a run-in with Javier, some pedestrian work on my thesis, resounding apathy from the workshop on my Dawson script, and a shitload of printing problems with the thesis that led to the use of $2 White Out on a copy of a document that supposedly will remain at UT Austin in perpetuity.    I'll come back around...it's what I do.  This is what I do.  Two steps forward, one step back.  It's progress, albeit grating, distressing, aggrivating progress.    How do you get someone giddy about script?  Or writing in general?  What must you do?  Where does the careless audience find interest, and how do you continue it?  Especially in screenplay, where the writing is so brief and the mind's picture so vital?    I want success today.  I think the realization that I won't have it for a while longer is tough to deal with at present.  Hopefully tomorrow will be the day that I get up and start working on the old script, or the new script, or the book idea, or the documentary proposals.  The day that the grabass stops.    Until then, I'm playing some kickass golf.
