My console sold more than yours! Yeah, act like a moron and see how far your getting yourself. Honestly, it just doesn't matter. All you need to know is that as long as the title " *Insert Console Here* is DEAD" doesn't show up, then you shouldn't really care about how much it sells. Infact, what you SHOULD care about, is how much a particular game you like sells. That way, there "might" be a SEQUEL for it's success. See where i'm getting at here? Fanboys don't think... Not enough gamers get an education, and the whole world falls to where every possible sale number counts. So in conclusion, what i'm trying to say here is that... you need to get yourself a life if sales numbers make you really happy(unless of course, you work for that company, then you know you won't get laid off).
