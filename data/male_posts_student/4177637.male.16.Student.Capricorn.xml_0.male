It's currently at the end of the 200 hall towards the commons, and I'm convinced it's impossible to get anywhere using the 200 hall. I'm going to credit the traffic in that hallway partly on stupidity and obesity. First of all, you have people who stand in the  center  of the freakin' intersections, talking to their friends as if they wanted the entire school to know what they wore to so and so's house. Wow. Really? That's so interesting. Now, move you retard. Not to mention the fact that a lot of people are so large, they take up the entire hallway and roll over everyone else. Please lose weight in consideration of our safety? Thanks. One day this week, I was at my locker and this enormous black guy just shoves me aside so him and his 3 chins could get through. Well, I obviously didn't do much since I really didn't want to be sat on, but I sure did take comfort in the fact that he'll probably be bagging my groceries a few years later anyways. Of course, he's probably an idiot too and will end up putting the eggs on the bottom. Damn.  Really, if anyone wants to switch lockers with me and you have one in the 300 hall (or even the other side of the 200 hall) I would pay you. Not really. But I'd be thankful.
