By doing so, we show that we do not care about what the Almighty God has given us. We only care about our survival. Fortunately, we have a forgiving God. He forgives us even though we sinned against him. But, sometimes I wonder, if we deserve his forgiveness? Are we grateful for what he has done for us? I too have sinned against him. I know that I have committed many sins. But, I want to repent. Too bad there is no space for repentance in this cruel world. Many people around us cannot accept the fact that one has repented. They just keep on reminding themselves of what evil things that person has done in the past, and always doubting whatever he says. This is also part of human nature. What is the true meaning of Humanity anyway? I think it's meaning is forever changing. Can we call ourselves human when we kill in wars? Can we call ourselves human when we destroy God's creation? I think we deserve to be punished by God.     Anyway, about today. I had quite a terrible day. It's a miracle i can still be happy about it. Firstly, my handphone and mp3 player got confiscated by Miss Chan, my geography teacher. Then, I had a very long lesson of A-maths. My handphone to me is very precious. It's like my personal assistant. It keeps track of all the important things I need to do, the important dates that I tend to forget. But, it got confiscated. All thanks to Mr. Nicholas Han. He is just one bored guy who has nothing better to do. As usual, I was playing with my headphones in class, I put the over my ears, as though I was listening to music. And my mp3 player was turned on to record the day's geography lesson. Miss Chan saw me playing with my headphones, and thought I was listening to music. She ask me to hand her the mp3 player. It was under my desk. Then, I told miss Chan that I was only playing with the headphones, but then, all of a sudden, Mr Han had to open his mouth and said that I had the mp3 player under my desk. So, Miss Chan asked me to hand her the mp3 player or I have to eat rubbish. I told her that I would gladly eat rubbish instead of handing the mp3 player over to her. So, I stood up and walked towards her. She walked to my table and checked under my desk. She found nothing. But then, the guy who cannot shut his mouth, said that the mp3 player was in my pocket. So, Miss Chan asked me to empty my pockets. Then, she saw my handphone and mp3 player. She took both away. I was very angry at first, but, I remembered that someone told me that God is a forgiving God. So, I knew that I had to forgive. In the end, I found out that forgiving is much more better than holding a grudge against that guy. When you hold a grudge inside of you, you keep the anger inside of you. Which is very bad. Anyway, I've decided to look on the brighter side of life. At least my things that were confiscated were in good hands. It's still better than getting it stolen. When it's stolen, you know that no one is going to return it back to you, but, when it's confiscated, you will always know that you will get it back someday or another.     I know that people are laughing at me right now, but I don't really care. When they laugh at me, I will also laugh with them. I will not hold a grudge against anyone. As I have to forgive them, like God forgave us of all our sins.   But, the sad fact of life is that I don't really have any friends. I guess that's the result of my attitude problem. I know that I have to change, but it's hard to change. Anyway, living life without any friends seems alright to me. But, in the end, I still have to change.
