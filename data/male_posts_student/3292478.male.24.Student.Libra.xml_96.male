Polling readers on their favourite guitar, drum, or piano solo, best obscure lyric and so on.  And so they devised the  urlLink Top 50 Coolest Song Parts ! Complete with small MP3 files to hear the song parts in question!!!  Not sure if I agree with all the choices but there are some blinders on there,  urlLink Prince's guitar riff  from " Let's Go Crazy " is wicked and  urlLink The Who's opening synthesiser riff  from " Baba O'Riley " has always been one of my favourites!  I do think the lyrical gem from " Tribute " by Tenacious D should have got higher than #41, facing the demon threat with such aplomb.  Demon : "Be you Angels?"  Tenacious D : "Nay, we are but men,  ROCK !"  The problem with polling a Top 50 list like this is that it always misses out some of your own favourites. I'd have loved to have seen the whiney synthesiser riff from Tina  Ike Turner's  'Nutbush City Limits' !!  A quality title and a great tune!!
