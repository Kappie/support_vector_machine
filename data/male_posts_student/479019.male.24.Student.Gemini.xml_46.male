So my stomach is feeling good right now. Nothing really excited planned for today... I'll probably do more research and try to catch  Scorpion King  with Jon and maybe Brandon if he's available.  Today's plan is relatively similar to yesterday's in which I researched and then hung out with Jenny. Seem's like research always has to come first these days... how exciting.   Oh yea... that sand sculpture in Gateway Commons at UCI is simply awesome.  In rotation right now is some  Lars Frederiksen  The Bastards ' self-titled (2001).  ***
