But this is the first time I'll ever be anywhere far without my family(kind of a scary thought). I know this will be a memorable experience. And the girl I like is coming too. Maybe I'll make my move while on the trip. Yeah right, I'm way to shy, especially cause I haven't really liked anyone in a while. Hey you'll never know, It is a different backdrop, anything can happen.
