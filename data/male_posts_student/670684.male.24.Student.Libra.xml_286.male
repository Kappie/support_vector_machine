Matt helped me open the account...a 30-minute excursion at his contemporary desk, no personal affects of any sort.  I wonder if he constantly wishes he was back in school, as the throng of UT hardbodies walk through there, wearing tight shirts, showing off their blooming bosoms, and believing that college requires fucking on frat boy terms.    The bank won't release my personal effects, unless required by law.  That is supposed to be comforting.    No new cell phone yet.  When I bought the old buddy, it cost $50...about $30 cheaper than the new phones.  I figured I could find refurbished again.  No such luck.  Sprint will take $20 off the price of a phone.  I can buy a new phone at $80, after my rebate.  I am so cheap.  I'm going to shop around at other Sprint stores just to see if I can find a chink in the armor.    30 minute haircut.  A blonde from Beaumont washed my hair.  New to Austin, loving it, and fitting in at the alternative hairstylists I visited.  I got a half inch taken off the long stuff.  Almost seems a waste, but it's now a controlled shaggy, and what must be an embarassing tanline is almost completely hidden since it stayed so long.  That's what poker'll get you.    Won $19 again.  Yeah, I don't have it today.  The blog hits me when I'm about to go to bed at 5 after standing around waiting to drive Brian's drunk friends home and teling Brian to get them in the car but then Brian opens himself another beer.  At 4:30 in the afternoon with a mind focused on catfish stir-fry and getting more errands done before writing and/or EverQuest tonight, the blog just suffers.  I write about my day.  That's great, but who really cares?
