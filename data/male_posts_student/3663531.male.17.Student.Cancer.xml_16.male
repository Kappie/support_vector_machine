Is it just me, or is anything beyond 12:30 am while by yourself either creepy (seeing things crawling on the couch seat next to me) or strikingly lonely?  Now I sit in my room, the clock just going over the 1 am mark, henpecking away at this keyboard, The Simpsons playing in the background.  Sleep will come, but what before it?
