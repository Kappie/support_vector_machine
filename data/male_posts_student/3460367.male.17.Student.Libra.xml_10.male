Tuesday I worked at the shop, then I ran 3 miles in under 20 minutes in 95+ degrees.  Just cause I was dared that I wouldn't.  Wednesday I worked at Bobi's then played basketball for 2 hours with Kyle.  I felt awesome.  I could have kept on going.  We played 5 games and it was a 3-2 loss for me.  But every game was decided by 2 points.  So he really only won by 2 points total.  He had to keep taking breaks too.  I had so many nice blocks.  I had to sit through Bible study because Renee came.  That wasn't fun.  Then I did the garbage and etc.  I got online (which was a mistake) and Lisa was on.  I didn't IM her, she IMed me.  Then she expected me to be talkative.  Which was okay and I tried.  I asked her how her day went, etc.  But this is something I've noticed.  Ever since Lisa and I agreed we didn't want to be dating I've gotten to see a side of Lisa that she hid pretty well.  When she yelled at me for trying to help I was pretty astonished.  Not the fact that she let lose, but the fact that she didn't apologize later.  Then last night she got online and she didn't really have anything to talk about.  So I tried to give her things to talk about.  I asked her how her day was, I asked her if anything exciting happened, etc.  She didn't ask how my day was etc.  It is really annoying.  Maybe I'm wrong or over reacting but I don't think so.  I ask about her day and her life because I care.  So when she got angry at me for talking about Nikki, IDK I was angry/hurt.  If I didn't care about Nikki and what was happening to her I wouldn't have asked.  It is really annoying.  I've noticed it more and more lately.  I want to talk to her about it but then again I am afraid she will flip out.  She doesn't handle being criticized very well.  Sometimes she will accept all the blame for something (losing a track meet etc) and then other times she won't accept any of it.  I guess I feel like I'm undervalued, I really don't like the way she treats me.  Just because we aren't dating anymore or whatever doesn't mean I get to be the one who gets to deal with her when she is not in a good mood.  I know she doesn't treat Kevin the way she does me.  Oh well.  Tomorrow I am working at Brownick doing who knows what.  Then more coding at night.  Saturday is the massacre.  Should be fun.  Off to the wonderful land of PHP with no girls... especially moody ones.
