(remember kiddies, thanksgiving was NOT invented as a prelude to christmas shopping.) it would be cool if other people did the same, but hey, it's not like i'm a trendsetter or anything. (yes  urlLink james , i'm doing it anyway :-D)  first there's the obvious things...  + friends...i can't say enough about you guys, friends make life worth living...yes that's pretty damn cheesy, shut up and read more... + family...even when they seem annoying as hell, they're always doing things with you in mind, they've been through a lot of strife and hardship to bring you up, and sometimes we kids don't understand that + being here in america...yea i told that to ira, it sounds stupid...haha...but i mean, we could've been born in africa with aids and extreme destitution, or worse, we could be born in FRANCE + and from america we have abundance...whether it be food, money, space, freedom (as opposed to say, taiwan where you have 8 hours of school and tutoring and blah blah)...we're pretty lucky to be here + school...don't be silly here and say oh, school sucks...even considering how crappy american schools are, esp cali schools, we're pretty blessed to have a decent education and a chance for our future  and then the small comforts in life...  + THIS KEYBOARD...mmmm feels so good...hahaha + fantasy basketball, if you haven't played it you have no idea what you're missing + music, fo sho...when you feel like crap, it's sometimes the only thing there for you + the internet...oh man, aim alone is worth about 10 paragraphs...screw tv, what would i do without my lovely dsl ;-; + sports, as a type of social gathering, as a way to hone in skills, as a way to just kill time, sometimes as an emotional release...not to mention the thrilling ups and downs of team loyalty (1-13) + books...although i don't read much anymore, not too many things beat the feeling of being engrossed in a wholly different literary world that keeps you up till 3 am reading reading reading...can you say parry hotter? + clothes...stupid as it sounds, oh man it's so cool to wear my rams jersey and t-mac 3's (with no-show socks, no less) + my room...it's got all of MAH SHIT in here, all condensed into a...16x10? foot space...including my color uncoordinated computer  i think i've run out of things to be thankful for. but you get the picture...i mean while it's great to be buying stuff and cooking and watching football during the holidays, sometimes it's good to just sit back and think about what makes these last few weeks of the year so special in the first place. everything from the material gifts, to the more immaterial...from what we want, to what we need...from what we enjoy, to what we truly cherish.
