I'm hyper-tired... you nkow that feeling you get right before you get crazy sleepy?        Hmmm... for those of you who couldn't figure out who Billy Bob and Ms. Crap-apple were in the last post, i'll tell you this: I don't think I want you to know if you couldn't figure it out on your own. Yesh... so today, all of the baby lizards we found in our garden finished hatching! Well most of them hatched yesterday/2 days ago, but today the last one hatched. It was cool. We set up an "environment" for them in an abandoned terrarium I used to keep my frog and fish in. So yeah, now I have a dozen baby lizards in my room! Yay! But they are just babies, so they mainly hide in the dirt... I haven't seen one come up today... oh well... Yep, and I got to go to my second favorite fastfood restaurant ever!! ARBY'S!!!!! Which FRIGGIN ROCKS by the way... but I mean... Arby's would have to bow down and kiss the feet of the ALL MIGHTY CZAR OF FASTFOOD SUBWAY! So yep.... I gotta pee, but I wanna finish this post first... Yep... we are getting a puppy! In about 4 weeks! Its gonna be a Boykin Spaniel... so I'm excited about getting it, because I absolutely love dogs. Yep... Claire doesn't like dogs... I miss her a lot... haha. Its been soooo long since I last saw her... or even talked to her.... so yeah, that blows. Nine more days! I think I can handle it, especially since Andy is having a party tomorrow night.... yay! Finally someone having a party! I'm happy! Hmmm if someone knows a cool song with a sweet bass line, tell me, because I want to have a really cool bass line to play over and over and annoy people with! Peace out holmz
