You know, my fucking diet has gone to shit. I was all for the eating healthy thing. Every time my friends would pick up a chesseburger or a cany bar, I would yell at them. I'm not fat. In fact, I'm a skinny pale white guy. I go to the gym a few times a week.I'd rather keep it that way. I'd rather stay healthy. I'd rather stay alive. What has changed to make me stop eating right? Do I not want to stay alive?  For fuck's sakes, I think I'm actually gaining weight. I have not gained weight in three years, and it is happening now. FUCK FUCK FUCK.  Whatever. I gotta get to the gym SOON. I have to get back to eating right. I have to. Just because I've venerably given up on life doesn't mean I'm going to be an out of shape slob.   Have you ever wanted to scream, but your lungs have collapsed? Have you ever wanted to love, but your heart won't beat? Have you ever wanted to be with someone, but you're on a remote island in the middle of nowhere?  That's what I feel like. It won't go away.   She's all upset about how she's hurting people. Newsflash: love hurts. Life hurts. You may hurt people, but most of them won't hate you. I don't, for one.  Does it even matter who you hurt? Shouldn't who you help, who you save, matter in the end. Perhaps it does.     I used to help everybody. I was like a personal psychiatrist, except for free. Now I create more problems than I solve.   I've always had somewhat of a sixth sense. Call it latent psychic ability. Call it wisdom. Premonition. Call it bullshit. Call it whatever you want. But sometimes, I just know.  I know it's going to end. I just don't know how.  She fuckin hates me. I fuckin hate me. The world fuckin hates me. Fuck.
