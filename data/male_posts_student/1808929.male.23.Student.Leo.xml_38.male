See, there's this one person who I'd really like to tell off. However, we work in an organization together so I can't exactly just tell her to go fuck herself like I would like to. Instead I just try to avoid talking to her at all, but man if I could only let the language flow from my mouth like water from a fire hydrant I'd tell her to go lock herself in a dark room and fuck herself repeatedly. She's such a bitch, and not in that cool Meredith Brooks kind of way either. This is a cold, petty, stupid, and irritating kind of bitchiness. Do her bitch-powers have no bounds? As I recall the stories of young King Arthur pulling his sword, Excalibur, from the stone I wonder who but King Arthur himself can pull out the stick from this girl's necrotic ass?  In more political news, my mother is actually considering voting for some democrats this time around. My mom is a veteran teacher who's been screwed over along with countless other teachers. Teachers in her position have their salaries frozen at 20 years of teaching experience. When you combine that with the fact that their health benefits keep on getting cut and that their requirements for retirement will probably increase it means that she will be getting paid less each year for the next several years and that she'll be forced to work 5 more years just to qualify for retirement. Educators are getting fucked by the Texas State Legislature. It's been this way for years and it's been due to dems and reps alike, but generally democrats are more friendly to teachers. I'm telling you something, whenever you get a conservative like my mother to consider voting democratic you know you've really fucked things up for her.
