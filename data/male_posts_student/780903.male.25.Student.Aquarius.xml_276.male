Quick story: I was going to the bathroom before class, and as I was walking in, a professor was on his way out, and there was another student on his way in right behind me.  I heard the following exchange:  STUDENT: Oh!  Professor! PROFESSOR: Yes? STUDENT: I'm so sorry I missed your class yesterday. PROFESSOR: Well, it was a very good class. STUDENT: Yes, I'm sure it was. PROFESSOR: And I hope you have a good excuse. STUDENT: Uh... PROFESSOR: I'll see you there tomorrow. STUDENT: Uh... yes.  Yes.  See you tomorrow.  I thought it was funny.  In international environmental law class today, the professor made a comment that I think would make a great slogan for the country Jordan.  "Jordan: Surviving entirely due to aid."  Yes, that'll get the tourists coming.
