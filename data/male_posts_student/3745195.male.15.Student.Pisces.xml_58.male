Not that exciting, but at least it's not about anisia (for those of you out there who are tired of me talking about my feelings for her) [ugh] Well Church was fun tonight. We went to the bowling alley and bowled. It was kool. The first game we played I didn't get one single strike or spare until the 10th frame when I got three strikes in a row and it was then that my nickname became Vin Deisil because on the score board it had a triple x. "XXX" nice. Oh but before all that (like before church) Anisia called and that was a pleasant surprise. So we talked for a while and I got to hear what Maggie's voice sounds like and I have to say...from her voice she sounds like she's hott. lol. Any way then I went bak to taking my nap and then got online for a while and talked to who else but Anisia and Maggie. I told anisia a little bit more about how I feel but I always feel like if i told her how I truely feel it would make things akward between us and that she wouldn't understand. Idk, but we're going to talk about things when she gets back, hopefully not immediately though cause I think we should see how things are working out as friends still.  Love you all Bye
