The thing is that mom had said she would pay for the 100K mile check-up, but this is a little bit past what she was expecting to pay.  With tuition and doctor's bills from a couple of visits last month,  I'll be living in cardboard style and sipping up mad puddle water to keep myself alive! Jebus!  I guess I'll be forced to stop using the gas pedal for a while.
