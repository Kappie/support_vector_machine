Then right when I got out KLT called me and I was getting ready then the awesome Brian came over. And I gave him his CD, but then I had to eat, so I ate. My sister's boyfriend Jason is staying with us for the time him and my sister are here. He is a really cool guy, he is sleeping in my room while I have to sleep in my brothers with him in his other bed. But Jason is really cool, after we ate, me, my dad, my brother, and Jason went golfing together. I haven't been golfing forever and I totally sucked it up. Really I did, it was horrible, but what can you do. Then after that, I came home and really did nothing. I just kinda did nothing. I just said that didn't I, oh well. But it was an awesome day outside. It was b e a utiful outside. Like 70 degrees, sunny. It was amazing. Then at 5 we went out to dinner for my dad. We had to register my brother at Bradley for his basketball camp first though. So we went there, and then went to Lo's Drive-in. I got chilli cheese fries which were really good, and an awesome choclote shake. Then after that we had to take my brother back to Bradley and then we went and visited my Step Grandpa, well kinda step. But they are the funniest people ever! I love them it was great just to talk to them. They are so upfront and say whatever, it's great. I love people like that. We stayed there for about an hour and a half and then went and picked up my brother from Bradley and then went home. I totally forgot about my APS. So I had to do all of it. We got home around 9:30, and I hadn't started any of it. But I just finished it 2 hours later. Oh well, at least I'm done. All I have to do is go wash my face and brush my teeth and then fall into bed. I'm going to be dead for summer school tomorrow but I always am so it's nothing new. I didn't get to talk to Amanda today though :-(. That made me sad, well I can see her tomorrow after summer school. So that's good. Well, I'm going to finish listening to my Brand New and then going to bed. See some of you tomorrow at 7:30 to learn about the Goverment and such!
