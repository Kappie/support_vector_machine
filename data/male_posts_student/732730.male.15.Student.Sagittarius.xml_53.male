The author meta tag says rufan-redi are  still  developing it.   That's bad for me because there goes any chance of a contract, and here comes yet another shitty, boring BB website. Crap.  In other news, I made kids cry at work today! "You cold, heartless prick!", I hear you cry. "Ha!", I reply. I didn't really make them cry. They were just dumb kids and made themselves cry.   Mr Seven comes up to my register and hands me a toy truck and says "Is this five dollars" in a sweet, innocent voice. I check, and nod and say "Yes". He then proceeds to hand me a five cent coin as payment. I say, in the nicest possible way, "That's five  cents , not five  dollars. " Then he goes all puppy-dog eyed and says "Puh, puh, puh-leease?" I say "no", because I don't want my till out by $4.95! Then he starts crying and mum comes along and says to her child "You can't buy that with five cents" and gives me a "Sorry, what could I do?" look.  Ms Five stands next to my register and plays with the little laser thing that makes the conveyer belt go. She plays with it making it stop and go, then when takes her hand away one time it doesn't go at all. I joke, "You broke it!" and try switching it on or off a few times, but alas! It still doesn't work. "Oh crap, it  really  doesn't work", I say. Ms Five sees the pained-slash-scared look on my face at starts crying in to her mum's leg. I feel bad, and say "Don't worry, they stop working all the time", but the snivelling continues. It starts working again a few moments later and I show her that it's all good, but she keeps crying. I get another "Sorry, what could I do?" look. I don't think she'll be playing with registers again any time soon, though...   Yes, another un-eventful day in my five hour shift at Woolies.   I had a kebab for lunch. I was feeling sick before I ate it, and I felt even worse after I ate it. Heh. I still feel like shit, so I think I might take a sicky tomorrow. Meh.
