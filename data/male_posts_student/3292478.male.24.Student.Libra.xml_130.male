Otherwise known as the  corpse flower  it releases the stench of rotting flesh so as to attract the flies it needs to pollinate it.   urlLink     The  urlLink University of Connecticut  has been cultivating one for the last TEN years! And its about to open. And it's all live on the net!  Take a look at the  urlLink webcam !  The flowering only lasts for a few days so catch it now!! Luckily it isn't  Smellyvision  as the plant has a smell akinned to old socks, rotten vegetables and dead fish!!  And if the whole thing isn't cool enough, the plant is warm-blooded so that it can heat up and better spread its putrid aroma!!
