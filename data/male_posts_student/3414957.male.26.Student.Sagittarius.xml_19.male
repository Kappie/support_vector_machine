I did some maintenance on all the computers, restarted the fileserver (it was responding way too slow) and restated the primary server. Everything is running smooth now. The fileserver is back to its old self again too.    I still have a paper to write, but I am not in the mood right now. There is nobody in here!! 2 people at the most have come in. I wish Paul would come in!!!! I really want to show him the K-Meleon Kiosk browser that I configured yesterday. He probably had tons of super genius homework to do.    I think I will surf Craigslist for awhile. I can't wait until Monday afternoon so I can start my art project (which is due Tuesday) and build my new computer!!!!! Muah ahahahahahah.
