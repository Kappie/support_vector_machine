She has pretty eyes, big and bright eyes. However it doesnt really matches her face. And something extra, she doesnt really have nice body shape. We went to Popular to buy some books at first, then we met Shueh Hao. He is the kind of annoying guy that i hate a lot. Then she went to meet her friend and i went to see some posters. Then she, her friend and i, went to buy posters together. Well we went to her friend's working place to buy. It was kind of embarassing there. Her friend thought that i was her boy friend. And we picked a lot of things together. Her friend, i thk she is called Qiu Ling or what so ever. Chiou Pyng kind of held my arms when we were going through tides of people. It was kind of embarassing for me and her. Well i tried to hold her arms nearer to me, she loosened her hand though. Explaining. Hahaha. After that, we went to the arcade. We met her classmates there. So funny.
