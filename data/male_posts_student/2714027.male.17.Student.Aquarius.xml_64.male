I managed not to think about the girl from the party too much, since  Trigger Happy , a brilliant book about videogames had arrived in the post and I read through quite a bit of that. It didn't stop me from developing a curious habit of listening to all the love-themed songs on my iPod though. I've been trying to keep myself busy because if I think about it too much, then my mind just goes into overdrive and I start thinking about it way too much. Tomorrow will be interesting though, since I'll see my mates for the first time since the party. There's a lot of chatting and gossiping to be done.  Anyway,  Serious Sam: The Next Encounter  calls and it needs reviewing...
