So, I have a Valentine's this year!  And I swear Edwin boi.  You rock my socks!  Dude I am sooo excited about this weekend!  I get some time with my boi... So yeah here he is  urlLink Edwin   I look forward to everyone listening to my tales of grandeur, my crusading by ranting. I also will indulge you all with stories of good haircuts, like the one I get tomorrow, both past and present. Mind you, some people might find what I say vulgar or offensive, but seriously, if that. I will say what I want, simply because I feel it needs to be said. I'm not going to be a complete dink or anything. I'm just saying, if I drop the f-bomb, or say something like gays should vote, well its my right, and you can go to hell for trying to stop me.   Hell, even if do say something incredibly stupid like "We should ship all the people with AID's onto an island, torture them, and finally put them to death after murdering their family" and someone starts bitching at me, well hell, I'll just put together a study, crunch the numbers, and prove why that is the best solution even when I don't agree. But I won’t maybe I will…  Is there a funnier word than flaccid?  Seriously, I don't think I could name one. You say the word and the absolute only thought it brings up is a limp noodle, so to speak. Even though it technically means lacking firmness, resilience, muscle tone, vigor or energy, no person ever talks about how their arms are flaccid. I invite you to try it on your friends though. Just mention how flaccid they look. Especially while showering together after a good workout. Feel free to mention how you wouldn't mind working out with him a few times a week to get some firmness in there.   Do you see? Even though what I just said wasn't that funny, because I kept throwing around "flaccid" and using it's inherent connection to penis jokes (which are incredibly funny in their own right) it became funny enough to stand on its own.   And just so you know, I am not here to be a comedian, so if that wasn't funny enough for you, go to hell. I am just trying to explain why this word is so damn amusing. Throw the word flaccid in the middle of any conversation, and suddenly any topic is interesting. Start telling Jim in marketing about how flaccid his work is. Tell him Jill on the third floor can help liven it up. Watch the sexual harassment hilarity ensue.   Hell, I am pretty sure its going to be part of skater lingo pretty soon if it isn't already. People just going on about how flaccid that move was. Of course, once flaccid starts moving away from the general consciousness as no longer just a word that describes the state of a penis, it will lose its funny, and we are stuck with just another word like "wiener" or "manipulatingunderagedgirlstohavesexwithyou" which have been played out to the point where they are meaningless.   So in closing, while my jokes may have been flaccid, the word itself is anything but. Try it out yourself today. I bet you bring out a smile in every persons inner child, or at least it will be awkward enough that they will have to smile and pretend they aren't extremely annoyed by your idiotic lack of tact.
