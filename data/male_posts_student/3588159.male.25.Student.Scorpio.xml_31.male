O think,  oh ...that's sad. There's a unexplainable sensation that such things shouldn't exist. They're awkward.       But the remarkable thing is that such "aethetics" of life even bother me, considering the societal fragmentation and crying needs all around. Why should "mere" matters of appearance even register?       May I suggest that it's a testimony to the fact that that Christ gave us not just a moral compass but an  aesthetic sensibility  as well... a sensibility that's meant to lead somewhere. He means us to enjoy creation, and know the good and beautiful when we see it. And (same as in the realm of truth and ethics) therefore the inverse is also true.
