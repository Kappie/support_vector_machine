YOU DON'T!! ahh ha ha ha MY FACIST PARTY RULES THIS BLOG WITH AN IRON FIST! MUAH HA HA HA!!! anyways getting off a huge acid trip...last night i hung out with ninja and evan...we stayed up until about 6:30...saw the sun come up...made me reflect on things...you know...just what's going on with me now. but in the end it wasn't that smart of an idea i mean...i had to get picked up at 8:30 for a trumpet practice...meh. as usual I get very little sleep but for some reason i do shitloads better than i do when i get good sleep...hmm can we say negative influence? yeah it went well...except that i won't get a lesson until september...meh.   So yeah...this is probably going to be my last post until july 24th...it seems like so far away, but i'm hoping it will go faster. it's sorta weird though saying goodbye to people you won't see for a month...but it's sorta like, you have to do it so you might as well do it how you want to.  Well i'm gonna sign off now. i'm eating a hotdog with spices and such everywhere...and i'm gonna watch Love Actually...hmm i've noticed i like watching love films now...i guess that's cool..i mean for emily's sake.
