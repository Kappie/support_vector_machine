Awww, that's boring... nothing to talk about... Anyways, ... nothing to say...  Oh, I'm so mellow that I can't get mad... Anyways, I might make this a member's only blog so that no one will be able to post comments anymore. I no there's a lot of good-intentioned people out there, but the recent comment by HiddenAssassin(deleted already) is completely unacceptable. It was complete, unconstructive, pure insulting, flaming. I will not tolerate anymore or this. Since I can't do much about it as long as this blog is public, it may not remain that way long. I do wish, however, that everyone continues to visit my blog, even if u cannot comment.  I'm terribly sorry for the stupid actions of the lesser humans among us, who, I'm sure will go to hell.  Thank you for ur attentiona and I understand if u never come to my blog again, but don't hate me. Hate HiddenAssassin(MSN me for his real name). He's ruined a good thing so take him up for it.  I can't be bothered with this too much. I can only handle this much insult and still be mellow, so I'll just go revel in my mellowieness. Cya.
