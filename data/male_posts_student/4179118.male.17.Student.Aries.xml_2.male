Here's the story,  one fine noon, a Weyland satellite is flying past sector 14 and heat signals were detected.. (for ur info. Sector 14 is a place that looks like the North Pole..) As the technology are very advanced then there are able to make out the blueprint of a temple hidden 2000 ft below the surface.. For fear that this place will be uncovered by other people/coporations, Weyland Bishop ask for the assembly of a professional team which includes a guid a.k.a pro ice climber, a chemist, a archegologist, some soldiers and some drilling experts, immediately. On the night that they arrived at sector 14, the beam was shot from the outer space impaling the thick layer of ice and open a path to the Temple.. When the Weyland's team discovered the hole, they are bewildered but they went in through there nevertheless. Reaching the bottom, they found out that they were the first to be down there and they are more bewildered than ever..  blah blah blah.. then they went in the temple.. unknowingly they step on a trap which triggers the temple to self activate.. The temple then automatically revives a frozen Queen and she was force to lay eggs... meanwhile, the party have went past a sacrificial chamber and half of the party were left there.. the rest of the party come to a place where they found the Predator's most powerful weapon.. the shoulder cannon.. btw i forgot to tell u all that 3 Predators have already landed on Sector 14 and they have killed everyone for surface and are beginning to worry because if the humans remove the shoulder cannons frm their positions the aliens will be released.. and that was wad happened.. so because of the activation of the second trap by the removal of the shoulder cannons the temple will rearrange itself internally every 10 mins..  Let me go straight to the first encounter between the two alien species.. it happens that the humans ran into the Predators( but that is because in the first place the Predators are looking for them) then got this scene whereby one of the Predator was on the verge of  trying to kill the leading actress.. however, a tail can be seen driven through the back of the Predator's body.. THE ALIEN HAVE COME TO RESCUE.. haha no la.. u noe the aliens got this cute cute tongue that they use to kill victims, esp by impaling their skull.. that was wad happen to the first one.. it so happens that the second Predator was nearby.. Upon seeing this he threw down the human he was  also trying to kill and went after the alien.. the fight was spectecular.. both of them are westling on the floors while the human ran away.. then the Predator was seen cutting off the Warrior(for ur info thaat is wad a normal alien is known as.. to know more about aliens leave a msg on wad u wan to know as a comment for my preview) tail and also tossing the Warrior about.. At a point, the warrior was trapped by a net thrown by the Predator.. this net have a self-tightening device which will squeeze the victim to death..  there was a big flaw though.. Aliens' blood are known to be acidic and it corroded the metal wires.. and out sprang the warrior jumpin on the Predator and adios amigo, the warrior does its fav trick impaling the head with its beloved tongue..  Its then back to the pathetic group of three humans again.. they are found by the third and last Predator.. Mr Weyland is at the same time dying frm a disease and he sacrifice himself(in a way) to stop the Predator.. while running frm the Predator the two other human, one of them the archeologist and the other the guide a.k.a the lead actress found a ancient text, the guy decipher it and found out that it was the Predators which thought human the art of  building.. and that Predators use the Temple as a Trial Test for all the Predators.. the Predators will come to Earth every 100 years and have this trial test.. this trial test is to prove that the Predators are worthy.. however if they fail.. which means they die.. they will then destroy every alien by self-destructing.. At this point, the humans decide to side the Predator and return their weapon to him..(supposedly the Predator is a male..)after 10mins the arrangements change again and of they went to look for Mr Friendly Predator.. *abit tired writning so much* something happened on the way, then it was the leading actress left.. she found the predator and return him the shoulder cannon.. Meanwhile, an alien came out and attacked the Predator.. he was abt to die when the gal found something to wack the Alien... she took the spear the predator and fought with the Alien( dunno where the Predator go to in the meantime.. must be watching show at the side..) Luckily the warrior died.. Then something happened.. the Predator let the gal join him and made her some weapons out of the alien's body.. Then off they went running together out of the temple.. Before leaving the temple, the Predator leave a time bomb behind.. Before going to the surface, the Predator was attacked frm the back like how the first one was.. but he survived because the gal was there to help.. then went to surface for the final showdown with the Queen.. u shd place more notice on the Predator's expression when he noes that the Queen nvr die.. Comical is the word i will use to describe his expression.. anyway, the predator was being stabbed frm the back again by these mother f***er Queen.. the Queen was exterminated by a pulling water tank which drag her to the bottom of the sea.. Sadly, the Predator died frm the injuries.. the ending was quite grand with the Predator's comrades carrying him off and a Ancient pass a spear to the gal for her recognition..   Thus this comes to the end of my preview.. pls comment on it if u think there are some parts that i shd add.. also post anything that u think is interesting in the movie..  Signing off, Zhengwei,Zatherus
