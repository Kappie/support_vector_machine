The flight was  long and really boring but we landed an hour early on thursday so we got through customs without any trouble and got our luggage and got our Migane car. IT could fit in the back of the office van. We then drove to Brighton and Uncle Doug spoke at 2 work shops. We stayed at a B which was good because i fell asleep on the job twice now were back to do another 3 workshops. End of transmission!
