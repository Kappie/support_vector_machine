My grandma died just now.  Don’t worry, don’t be upset, and don’t say anything.  Just let it go.  For you reading this now, I'll see you tomorrow, talk to you on the net, or anything of the sort.  I'll be the guy making jokes to his friends.  She went slowly, without any struggle. She had friends and family around, crying, comforting, reminiscing, and making jokes to change the mood.  I said I would start worrying when my grandma stopped criticizing people, and I don’t think she stopped.  She was probably still looking at us, just laughing at the singing, telling my mom to stop the music, and telling me to cut my hair.    I just looked at it all.  I watched my family crying, I heard vague whimpers; inaudible, but present.  No one feels extremely bad.  We're all upset, we all miss her, but we felt ok about it.  I know I'll see her again, I'm positive I will.  With my grandpa, and my aunt Judy, and anyone else from my family.  I'll be the guy making jokes.  Good night everyone, and seriously, whoever you are reading this, thanks.  Thanks for taking the time to know me and read my stuff and help me out.
