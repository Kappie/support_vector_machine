But I would like to focus on a different aspect of Sunday worship, I have been reading my past posts, I have been a little bit too critical of today's church.  I need to have a positive outlook about the church, for it was the church Christ gave his life for.  If God who knows the faults of the church (including mine) more deeply than I can fanthom, yet has great faith in the church achieving his purposes, then maybe I should cut the church some slack. But back to Sunday, let us not focus on how wrong other people/denominations/the world's values are, let us focus on how great and perfect our God is and this is the same perfection, I pray we strive to achieve until we humbly down before glory for eternity.   EPH 3:14 For this reason I kneel before the Father, 15 from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name. 16 I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, 18 may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, 19 and to know this love that surpasses knowledge--that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.      EPH 3:20 Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, 21 to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.
