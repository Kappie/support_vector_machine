Going to Mexico for Honeymoon/Getting my Handycam jacked 5. Melange/DFWAC art show 4. Quiting my job at EJB Development 3. Landing a shitty job at Zales 2. Moving to California 1. Getting married to MiMi  What a fucking year this has been. Looking back on it, my jaw drops. Did I really do all of this - in one simple year. Time flies any way you look at it.  Damn sore thoat. I think I am coming down with a bit of a cold. I really hope I can shake it. I would like to do some drinkin tonight. Ring in the celebration of time. We throw everything into days, weeks, months and make up some day where it starts all over. An excuse to get wasted. There is no harvest, no renewing or dieing really. Just a bunch of made up shit! The world is great, I wouldn't trade this bullshit for anything!
