Who knows, maybe it will be good for me?  I arrived in Philly August 8, 2004.  After a wonderful day of moving in and being completely exhausted and slightly sick from eating something which did not agree with me that weekend I was officially in the city.  Last week was orientation.  Last week was fun.  Last week went way too fast.  I really like my class because there is such a variety of people represented.  Black, white, asian, indian, christian, jew, islamic, atheist...you name it I am sure someone of your description goes here.  And another interesting thing is that a lot of people are either engaged or married trying the whole med school thing.  I'm really glad my social attachments do not involve anything remotely romantic right now.   Anywho, I'm writing this at the end of my 2nd day as a MSI (med student).  And how do I feel?  Rather relaxed to be honest.  The key is keeping up with the material each day.  That requires about 3 to 4 hours of study once you get home from classes which normally run 8-4/5 each day.  A typical day for me involves lectures beginning at 8 and normally going through 11 or 12.  At that point, at least in this trimester, we all heard up to the anatomy lab and dissect our cadavers for 2 to 3 hours at a time.  Being only the second day, I am still getting used to gross.  Our lady, Ruby, is a large black lady who graciously donated her body for the sake of society hopefully receiving compentent doctors in 4 years.  There is nothing more surreal than looking at the shell of a person, and then violating that shell in order to learn all you can about whatever section of the body you are on (right now it's the dorsum).  I really don't want to make this an extremely long entry because I will write again and touch on other things...but real quick; found a great church about 20 minutes away on Sunday, very young, very contemporary, nondenominational.  I'll probably check it out again this Sunday.  God got me to this point in my life and I know He will carry me through this stage as well.  Ok, bed time-I'm trying to be ambitious and will be getting up before lecture tomorrow for a bike ride...God Bless.
