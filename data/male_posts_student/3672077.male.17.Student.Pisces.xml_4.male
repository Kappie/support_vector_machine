Only problem is that I'm not coding my own site this time, simply because I don't have the money to buy my own domain and get movabletype like I want. Instead I have to stick with the free stuff and I figure that if I'm going to stick with the freebies that I at least make it somehow integrated with my new toys. Well it looks like I'm starting over, but this time with the help of my gadget I might make more entries consistently. Enjoy.
