Took the train to Serangoon, and walked back from there (took 25 mins.. but... felt it was good excercise, and kinda freed my mind for a while... kinda relaxing to walk a bit ba...)  Went to Aaron's house at 6.15 pm. My, his corner terrace design is like a rectangle.. not the usual square... kinda big for the terrace porch, and as well as the rooms. Nice house hes got. Haha. TL was with Aaron when I saw him too.  Browsed stuff on Aaron's com till around 7.35, and we headed down to Atrium.. had dinner (fast food again!), i went up to play some Wangan, only to find that theres only 2 machines left... Man... it sucks.. But oh well, TKA.. Heard that its going to HongKong.. What a pity. Got a 12'49'300 for my Metropolitan Highway, on BlackBird. Since BB is a out-of-control car, this timing wasnt too bad I suppose. Gonna try out the Reina GTR 32 soon. Expecting something like 12'49'500.  Stayed around Atrium and played a few rounds of ID, challenged a Evo7 which I took to Akagi first, then he took me to Myogi (lol) and that was it. Talked to Uncle Phillip, as well as some of the other guys. Got an extra $5.50 free when I topped up the $15.  So thats about it, gonna sleep already, if not I'll be a walking zombie again tomorrow, Nitez !
