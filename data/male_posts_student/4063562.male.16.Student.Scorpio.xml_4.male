Well today was the second day of school and when i was talkin to rachel i noticed she was acting kinda weird bout somethin cause she acted different. Then she was like did u read my blog from last nite, and i was like nah my computer was fuck up which it really was. Then i planed on readin it during lunch but she said nah wait til u got to swofford to read it so i did and on it she was like " i think its time for us to go out and we need to talk bout it in person". So i was oooo snap. when i saw her again i was like yea i read something on the internet today at swofford and right then she knew what i was talkin bout. And of course she said yes! cause i mean come on who can turn down this huh? yea nobody. But anyways then i saw her at meet the cardinal and she had on these tight pants omg. And she even gave a little present afterwards before she had to go cause u know i'm that good. So yea now i offcailly goin out with her, so that has diffently rised my coolness level.  Ps:   and
