Despite getting a bit fucked up over Ms H the night was a success. I got twatted, had a laugh and a bit of a singsong, played in the adventure playground, got eyed up many a time by the police and even negotiated a pishy lookin roll up with ease. Result. Anyway I wont go into further detail about my thoughts and whatnot on said girl, trying to rebuff all that these days, I was doing so well! Anyhoo, executing a swift change of subject, the Libertines are number 2 in the charts as we speak, fucking amazing.  Hopefully now when i try to recruit more disciples to the cause i wont get as many blank expressions as a reply.  The Libertines are gospel and all heathens shall be punished in hell, the chart placing is surely testament to not only the bands solid fanbase but also to their amazing songwriting and ability to pen a classic pop song. I can just pray they keep it together long enough to witness their successes rather than acheive cult status after the death of Pete which, it must be said, is only a matter of time, unfortunately.  I had a hangover this morning, thats the first in a long time, didnt have my staple breakfast of Rice Krispies, thats how bad i was feeling! Only in times of crisis do I skip the ever-present cereal in the morning. As a result im starving the now so i'll go seek nourishment. Ta-ra.
