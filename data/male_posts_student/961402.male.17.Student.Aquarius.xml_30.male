A thurough scanning of the MD DMV site has convinced me that he links of sties.  Whaelse...those numbers are still happy. Yup. Bouncybouncyweeee.  Gotta get packing for Costa Rica...it's funny, my overall situation hasn't changed over the past 12 hours, but the relief of knowing that I won;t have to retake those god-awful classes just fills me with joy...so much better.   Happiness=d(Situation)/d(Time)  On the upside, my sudden burst of anxiety prevented me from ordering anything from CmDonald's on the way home...my dad's an idiot for getting drive-through at midnight. And for picking me up late.  I need to go study for my learner's renewal tomorrow.  -Jaiwithapermit
