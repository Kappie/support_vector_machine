Must be traffic or something. I wonder what today brings and days after that, I often find myself wondering about everything that happens. I don't, I guess it's my nature to think and wonder. I guess it what sets me from others. Hey it shows I care; Right?!?! I got my acceptance letter for the summer scholorship at C.S.I! I think I already said that last night...but who cares! I have an english report to do which I find so silly. I'm just happy i only have to worry about my report and about no one else's. No worrying about helping them find a concept, no more helping them to type it, no more me doing it at all period! Still, I often wonder if I'll go back to that. It was aggravating, but there are sometimes that I do miss those times. I don't know i guess it kept me busy. Nah! I'm busy with my life they can handle their own!. Ok, I guess I'll go order pizza and answer the door!   Here's this log's song! It's Chris Issak - I Wonder! I don't feel like putting any of my own originals up. I don't anyone to take it off my site like the first one i put!   "When I was younger I believed, that dreams came true. Now I wonder. Cause' I've seen much more dark skies, than blue. Now I wonder.  I keep on praying for a blue sky, I keep on searching through the rain. I keep on thinking of the good times, will they ever come again? Now I wonder.  I keep on praying for a blue sky, I keep on searching through the rain. I keep on thinking of the good times, will they ever come again? Now I wonder.  When I was younger I believed, that I could win. Now I wonder. There was a time when you and I, walked hand  hand. Now I wonder.  I keep on searching for the old me, I keep on thinking I can change. I keep on hoping for a new day, will I ever feel the same? Now I wonder. Oh I wonder. Now I wonder."
