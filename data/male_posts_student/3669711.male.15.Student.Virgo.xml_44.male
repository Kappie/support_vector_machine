It's a Sci-Fi anime taking place in the year 2225, where space travel is common and the solor system is engulfed in a sea of plasma and cosmic rays named the Gedult.  The animation is lush, using strictly animation, i see no CG as of yet in the 17 episodes I have watched.  Character development comes along with the story.  As you learn more about the events that take place in the story, you learn more about the characters, and their past.    At the beginning, you are thrown into the story, and might be a bit confused, like i was.  At first, i didn't like the series much because of the confusion i was having with it.  After watching a few more episodes, the events previous still didn't make much sense, but i was captivated by the characters and the story.  In about episode 10, the events of the first episodes were explained, and finally everything made sense.    I am currently watching the trailer for the english version of the series, and it seems that the voice of the main character, Kouji, is played by the same person that did Quatre in Mobile Suit Gundam Wing.  It is made by Sunrise, a name you might recognise as the creators of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, Coyboy Bebop, Escaflowne, and others, all of which i like.  You can see that they want to express quality and imagination in everything that they do.    So far, i am enjoying this series imensily, and would recomend it to anyone who wants a good Sci-Fi/Action anime!  Lates
