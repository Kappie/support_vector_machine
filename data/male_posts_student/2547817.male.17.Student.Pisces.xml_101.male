It was too loud. Bloody funny- literally. When we were buying tickets, we caught this little soccer advert on the preview screen and were pretty amused by what little we saw. Waited for half an hour for the video cycle to repeat itself, but it didn't. After the show, we waited again for about 10 minutes, munching at sugar coated kachang. FINALLY when the advert come on, the guys and I burst into cheer and consequentially, we were given looks by people. We thoroughly enjoyed the advert and laughed out butts off and all. I was happy. I was happy. I was.... happy  Am unable to take the stress of JC. Am seriously cracking up. Didn't go to school today. Had "acute fatigue syndrome"... hahahaha... Even then, I wasn't able to finish my reading. Still have got 12 pages to go. Am very upset. I need God.  Maybe my love will come back someday, only heaven knows.
