Directions: Read the bold text first, then the plain, and then all of it normally.   Hey that's me caughty wolly unaware  recalling a "cloud" was once a "rock" or "hill",  I'm lookin out the window Standing there,  the clouds are framed and stationary still,  Seeing myself in this, I'm struck to find  they turn to erratic phantoms, and they float  Across the living room, in the back of my mind,  like empty cartoon bubbles, though you'll note  How little I have changed. It's the same old view  darkening now beyong the blue moraine  In the same old window I keep turning to.  a ling of thunderstorms and sheets of rain.       Here is my friend jesse from prom! he is an awsome guy lol i'm trying to get other pics on here but this is the only one its let me download so ill get back with u on some more!!
