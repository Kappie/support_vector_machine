Something must have happened, because that inseparable secondary school gang had disappeared. I only saw four individuals instead of four stalwart friends yesterday at dinner, and even so, we seemed more concerned with ourselves than with our peers.  It is difficult to maintain friendships, but it saddens me that such things are unfortunately inevitable.  Such a coincidence; I had to get hold of this song by Keane today.  EVERYBODY'S CHANGING (Keane)  {VERSE} You say you wander your own land But when I think about it I don't see how you can You're aching, you're breaking And I can see the pain in your eyes Says everybody's changing And I don't know why  {CHORUS} So little time Try to understand that I'm Trying to make a move just to stay in the game I try to stay awake and remember my name But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same  (instrumental)  {VERSE} You're gone from here Soon you will disappear Fading into beautiful light 'cos everybody's changing And I don't feel right {CHORUS} So little time Try to understand that I'm Trying to make a move just to stay in the game I try to stay awake and remember my name But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same  So little time Try to understand that I'm Trying to make a move just to stay in the game I try to stay awake and remember my name But everybody's changing and I don't feel the same  ---  Well, maybe it  is  just me. Or is it me that has changed? I need to think about that.
