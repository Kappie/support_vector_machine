Dammit dammit DAMN IT like a MONKEY!1!1  I has to get surgery on toosday to get this impacted tooth of mine "exposed", so they can put another bracket on it, and pull it up into place.  Booooohullll crahhhappp!!!! Grr, that's another year down the fucking drain having metal in my mouff, and thats not including the time i'll be out because of the damn anesthetics.  I was reading the list of "risks" i would be taking when i'd be put under, one of them stated that i may have numbness in my mouth for weeks, months, years, or sometimes- permanent. Everything else i could deal with, but numbness permanently? I'm confused, but i could have sworn that the reason i was getting this surgery done in the first place was to not have my nerve cut(which would produce none other than NUMBNESS).  THEN, guess what. Later on in the year I have to get my wisdom teeth removed. All 4 of them!  My parents try to make me feel better... "you get to miss school! hooray!" and I respond with "And i'll have trouble eating and sleeping for the next forever, and even if i do eat anything, i wont be able to chew very well, because of the NUMBNESS... hooray!"  I have to be asleep for the wistom teeth removal, but for the first one, my parents want them to give me laughing gas. Apparentally they don't know how fucking hard i laugh. I know, i know, it doesnt 'actually' make you laugh, its supposta relax you... but i dont know how it's gonna work with me being all "relaxed," trying to strike up a conversation, but end up not being able to talk because of the numbness...  "He.... Heh.... HeyyyY!!! look at meshhhh!!! heheheheehe... im getting my gumfs cut!"  and the dentist would be all  "you gotsa calm down now foo! i is tryin to fix yer teef!"  and the nurse would all be a gamer and be all like  "j00 s1t d0wN amd 1 g1vex0rz j00 an muff1n! T3hnm 1 hax0rs j00r pceh and stoeled yuor megahurtz1!!!"  ^^if you could read that, good job- i didnt even look at the screen... or the keyboard.  Anyway, I just had a conversation with a friend, and i was gonna type this, but i dont feel like it, so ill just post the log.  ahsboomer: why ShuChoMouff: because it's a son-of-a-bitch and wont come in right ShuChoMouff: my dentist even said "its retarted" ShuChoMouff: apparentally i'm an unusual case ShuChoMouff: and apparentally my orthodontist is incompetent and doesnt know that my wisdom teeth are coming in.  That's right, my orthodontist is a shit and can't even xray my teeth when shes supposed to, shes too busy remodeling her office. So she's trying to separate my teeth, and at the same time my wisdom teeth are pushing their way up, undoing all her work, and then my wisdom teeth are gonna cut off my nerves so i'll be paralyzed(or numbed) in the chin, which will SUCK, so were gonna take the xray to her, and tell her basically to pull her head out of her ass and compensate.  Ooh, and guess what? When they knock me out to do the surgery, I'm not allowed to eat for 8 hours before! Those assholes wanted to give me an AFTERNOON appointment!!! That means i'd have to wake up at like 2 in the morning if i was gonna eat anything. No, fuck em, i'll just go a week later and get it done in the morning. W8! that lockin's the day after! SHIT! Well, i'll just do it on that friday. Or tuesday. Whatever.  My mom is concerned that she's gonna have to let my dad take me on the appointment day, because she has school. She might even skip her classes. WHY?!?!? It's not like i'm performing a floorshow or anything. In fact, i might not even wanna talk! *gasp!* What's she gonna do, sit there for 48 hours while i wallow away, being numb and not eating anything?  It seems too convienient. It's like the tooth conditions were created so the dentists would have jobs. It's wierd, both my brother and I have these wierd impacted teeth conditions, and my parents never needed braces. It's a conspiracy!!!! Dammit, they're putting something in our food now. I hate the world.
