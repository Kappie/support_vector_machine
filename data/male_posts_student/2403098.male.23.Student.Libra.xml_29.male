I love them for lovin' me and they love me for lovin' them, and we LOVE each other.  Oh good, a comercial for Aaron Neville's gospel album is on.  Mr. Neville should be a muppet.  Why can't I EVER think of him without thinking of Linda Ronstadt?  I don't know.  In fact, as the tune went.. I don't know much, but I know I love... TNT!  Seriously though, my back.. hurtin' real bad.  I'm not too sure why, but I've tried everything.  Hot bath, hot shower, laying on the floor, laying on my stomach, drinking acid.  NOTHING seems to work.    Good, FB's Day Off is back on.  I'm so glad.  It just makes me want to move to Chicago THAT much more.  Not because FB's Day Off shows me a side of Chicago I just really want to see, or that I think I'll steal my dad's car and parade around Chicago all day while skipping sophmore-year english, but just because it's IN Chicago.  I guess it just reminds me, once again, that I love it there.  Oh SH*T!!!  Cameron just found out that his dad's car has a BUNCH extra miles on it.  DAMNIT!  He is SOOO screwed.  okay okay okay, I wont give anything else away, you'll just have to go see this movie for YOURSELF.  I think it's still in theaters, who knows.  I ran into this girl from high school when I was at dinner with my parents.  It is somewhat odd to see people that I went to school with forever, and hear about how they are in 'careers' now.  CRAZY to me, because I still see them in, like, a yearbook photo or something.  I guess I also forget, because I am still in school myself.  DAMN losing credits for transfering schools, DAMN taking my sweet time! haha.  Oh well, I refused to bust my arse in order to graduate in December, just to sit around for 7-8 months before I could start law school anyway.  So actually it worked out better to just have 3 classes ahead of me this coming semester.  WOO.  I WISH they were easy easy easy classes though.  OOOOH!!  Cameron just killed the car.  DAMN, sorry I will stop that.  Go see the movie for yourself.  *THIS JUST IN*  Britney Spears got married.  This report is unconfirmed, but you heard it here first.  That hooker got married in Vegas.  Talk about a decision that will not be a lasting one.  I don't even know who the guy is as of yet (I'm not FoxNews here people) and I STILL can tell you that miss B.S. (wow her initials spell out what I think of her career) isn't going to be a lasting wifey-wife-wife with her own reality show a-la Jessica Simpson/Nick Lache.  How retarded.  HA I love it.  I am SO bored.  No one I know is in town anymore, my brother no longer lives at home, my parents are asleep, I have nothing to do and no where to go.  I don't even have a car.  Speaking of cars (i'm all over the place), my mom ran her's off the road today and into a curb. It's weird to see a car drive straight, but be pointed a few degrees to the left.  That's what her's does now.  I should take the loaner car out for a spin right now.  That'd be fun.  However, I can just see what would happen.  I'd be off the road, and into a curb myself in NO time.  Murphy's damn law.  Who IS that Murphy character, and why is he always causing us so much grief.    I really have nothing else to say so I'm closing. I'm not even performing a spell-check on this piece of shit entry.
