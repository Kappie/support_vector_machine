What if I did open up your mind, and was able to know exactly what you were thinking at any given moment? Would I find what I want to find, or would I simply find reason to avoid any conversation with you at all?    I am different than the rest. Perhaps you've seen glimpses of it that I have tried to make visible to you. Perhaps you haven't. Either way. I am not like them.     History repeats itself. Every form of competetion I've ever met, I have fallen to. It is accurate to say that I have never won. Or at the very least, that I have rarely won. Every guy I have ever competed agains for the attention of a lady, I have lost. Even my own girlfriend. Everyone I have ever competed with is sports, I have lost. Career wise, yes, I've lost. For some reason, people can't see what I'm really like. My commitments, my motivations, my goals and aspirations. Always pushed aside. They think I can't handle myself.  I refuse to be handled
