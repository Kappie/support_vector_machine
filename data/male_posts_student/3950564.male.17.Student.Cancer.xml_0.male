I went to John Carroll University and Case Western Reserve University, I am not a big fan of Cleveland. . . But both campuses are very "unwired" and full of the latest WIFI technology, which is great. Case, well. . . its a huge campusand a veryprestigious school that is willing to give me lots of money which is always a good thing. And, Case has this special turbo super fast internet. The one thing I dont like about Case isthe dorms; the dorms are very small and scary looking which is a major factor in my college decision. JSU has slightly bigger dorms with carpet and the bathrooms looked alot cleaner. Also the campus of JCUis more centralized and iseasier accessedby these cool underground tunnel hallways. (Plus they have a pool, and big exercise room, and better food) As of now I couldn't tell you what college I want to go too but I am going t0 major in Biology, hoping to eventually go into Microbiology. This summer is still ripe for lots of college visits which will hopefully take me to Miami, Kenyon, and maybe Ohio Northern, also I am going to try to get to some out of state colleges. Also today I got out of the Republican Club that Alex has started. . . and I wasn't glad about that, hahaha, yeah right. But I still want to keep going, for the campaigning part. O well, there are more colleges to research on Princton Review, update later, maybe.
