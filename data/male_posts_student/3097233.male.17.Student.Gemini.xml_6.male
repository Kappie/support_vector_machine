As you can tell, still not over my ex.. Won't be for some while ~if~ I ever do get over her, which I'm starting to doubt.  Let me go on about my 'day' though...  Late start this morning, so didn't have to get to school till 8:58, made it there about 20 minutes early to do Math homework, which I didn't do..[not sure it is hard to guess what my mind was on?]. Then at 9 am this morning the Test from hell was unleashed in Math class and I was told I had two periods to finish it, damn I hate math... [yet I signed up for not one, BUT two AP math classes for next year..]. On with the day though. I go through the test, nothing too hard really but a waste of trees and graphite from my pencil [mechanical of course].  Off to 3rd period at the bell, to Medieval History [yes, that is how it is spelled damn it, ME-DIE-VAL, which means Middle in Latin or something but yea]. Watched another part of 'A lion in Winter'. What a tear jerker...I listened to music instead.  Onward to Spanish!!! This was possibly the high part of the day. Other than the singing in Spanish it wasn't that bad because we danced the La Bomba, and the highest part was that I had two women, [girls if you must call them that], as partners, and I can say, wow, they are not bad looking and not the dumb blonde types which makes it so much better.  Well the damn bell rings, and even though it is 30 seconds late every period, and is not even a DAMN BELL [a tone is what it is]. Off to lunch, Felt like crap as I went too, had to walk by my ex like 4 times... That shot up any good memory for a good part of the day feeling sad for myself... Will need that to go away -soon-. At lunch I did work for 6th period [TOKA-yearbook] and that way I'd be free to do nothing in TOKA.  Ding Ding. *loads a gun, unloads shells into the crappy server that holds the tone maker*. Into TOKA, scanned a picture for a friend in there, they all looked like dead people with 20 pounds of make-up, which, by the way to all women and some men I guess that are reading this is JUST WRONG! Well later in class burnt up some paper [with electricity and heat from a lamp, on acxy, I swear!]. Helped a guy make his senior project too.  Off to 7th period, where I was late to but was excused because I helped the guy with his project. Current Events, did you know that some guy up in Portland tortures his kid every day with protein diets and Aikilo [I think?] exercise??? Yea, we did current events which took me a whole 3 minutes. Then I coloured some CD's and listened to Weezer the rest the period.  Last and least of all was English class. 8th period... Had a person from the office come in to 'explain' [*cough*NAZI*cough*] what to do and what was changing with school next year and what we were to do to sign up for next years classes [SENIOR YEAR BABY!]. We are losing a bunch of classes and teachers due to cuts and also we may be going to block form, and we will be losing 2 periods and daily late start, though you can take an early bird in the morning so that you start at normal time and are able to take an extra class, which I have to do...  So here is my schedule as of right now: First Semester: AP Statistics AP Calculus 1 Intro to Web Design [Yea, I should be in like AP AP web design...] Activities [a fancy name for PE] Creative Writing [a fancy name for sit the hell down and write what comes to mind, kind of like this Blog so yea it works.] LUNCH Senior C.E. [economics in other words] ~Alternative class: Comp Programming I [another form of programming for comps]  Second Semester: AP Stat AP Calculus Advanced Web design ['bout time] Senior Project [I am praying that this class goes goodbye! I don't want to do a senior project] LUNCH Comp Programming I or activities and another Senior economics thingy ~Alternate is AP Comp programming  My AP Statistics class is the early bird because that is the only time to take anything then so I free up a space for my other classes.  So far that has been my day really. I came home and played a game with a good Friend [played BOLO, old Mac game we used to play and re-found for Windows [called WinBolo] ].  Talking to friends about Hating my life right now and trying to tell them not to worry and to not try and give me as much advice and not to tell me everything gets better because they are just lying and they know it too. So this is when I came here to write some. I think this is good for a day? Also, anybody that actually reads this can go to my site,  urlLink THIS SITE , and I will have a chatroom there, and I will have a forum soon I hope so you can get a hold of me. I also am adding today my Online status for Yahoo messenger for those that have it.  I'm off for the day Blog. Don't let the worms and bugs bite, and stop humping my damn keyboard!
