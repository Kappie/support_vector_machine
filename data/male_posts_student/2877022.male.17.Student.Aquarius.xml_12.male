NOTE: i am updating simply to show that i have visited! =] so anyway to start of this entry, a big big THANK YOU to ke ai for taking bus back with me! always my favourite ke ai man x) well today was lecture day so talked a whole bunch of crap and copied notes with my favourite canoeist/cook! had a really good time laughing and talking rubbish with her. our class girls are seriously the best man. can hold a decent conversation with every one of them! (class guys also very nice la) then today during pe we had captains ball AGAIN and as usual the girls outnumbered the boys and we win. well we have to at least or it would be extremely embarrassing. wouldn't it? then we had economics and math tutorial which were basically like every other tutorial just that i would like to say that our new economics tutor is not bad and i actually don't find her boring! yay thank God she is staying with us till the year end. so i have managed to squeeze out a few paragraphs about my day at school which sounds really similar to ke ai's and should be for the obvious reasons. so i shall end here in case it becomes to repetitive and i'll spare you people the boredom! x)
