My mom printed them out and annotated them.  Wow.  My dad is a bastard.  He lied all the time.  He denied things that were true.  The man is a bastard.  I fucking hate him.  I will never forgive the bastard for what he did.  But now he's out of the house.  I don't know where he is.  I'd ask my mom, but she's too upset right now.  I hope he fucking goes to hell.  He's a despicable person.  I want him to fucking die.  This sounds overblown.  It sounds like I'm being that bitchy attention whore that I complain about so often.  But seriously.  The man ruined my life, he ruined my mother's life.  Just because he had sex with my mom roughly 17 years ago doesn't mean I have to love, like, or respect him.  I'm afraid of what this will do to my life though.  I wish I knew more about divorce law.  My mom doesn't have a job.  Will she have to get one?  Will my dad be a bastard and withhold money?  Will the divorce precedings be bloody and drive them even farther apart?  At least I have one less worry now though.  I mean, my parents suck.  I'm pissed at both of them.  I feel sorry for my mom.  But I love Center on Halsted.  I had so much fun last time.  Hopefully tomorrow night will be the same.  I feel so comfortable with those people.  I feel... normal.  Everything I think becomes the norm.  And that's cool.  Acceptance is fun.  But not only that, I've gained so much confidence.  I see guys, and I'm willing to think of them in that way.  I had a conversation with my brother about my sexuality.  I just feel so much more comfortable in my own skin now.  "It's a good thing."  -Mike  "Today seems like a good day, to burn a bridge or two.
