I didn't do very good on my first test because I didn't get a book to practice with because there wasn't enough copies. But now I have one. I've practiced a lot, and I'm really good at it.  Ricky (my fish)is doing good. He's a fat little pig fishie.  The Flames play tonight. Every time I say "open me a can of whoop-ass", they win. I've said it a lot today.  This is my new closing   GO FLAMES GO!   PS I hope no Shark fans are reading this.
