Because if i can figure out exactly what the things are that do this for me, I can at least try to work on them, now i dont know if they are the same for everyone, but here are mine, I think. Firstly, I need to have contact with other people, now this may seem obvious, but its a really important one, most people need to be sorrounded by a group of people who will activley try to seek out their company and genuinly like being with them, in other words, a good group of friends, im not just talking one or two, im talking a good sized group, essentially what im saying is i need to feel resonably popular. Secondly, I need to be busy, this may seem obvious to most people as well, but its not easy to see where to draw the line, busy can just mean that you have things to fill your days, that you dont wake up in the morning and struggle to think of a reason to get out of bed, you should always havea reason. I dont know if a hobby counts as this or not, for me a hobbies not essential, but im sure it mightbe for some people. This leads me to my next point, a job, I need to have a job, not only for practical reasons, like i need the money, but i also just think theres an inbuilt human instinct to want to work, somehow. Next, I need to be fit, this is why I go to the gym, I feel like crap if I dont exercise, this is a very important point, enough said. Lastly I think,and heres the most difficult on of all, I need to have a companion, a girl, this is really important, you need this kind of affection and you're not going to get it from anyone else, you need someone who likes you more than anyone else, someone to share things with etc. Now, heres my point I guess, when you've covered all but one or two of these issues, it throws the remaining ones into much sharper contrast, you can end up feeling terrible because you can see so clearly whats missing from your life. You can see what you need to be complete. This is the problem I am experiencing at the moment, but hey, at least I can identify my problems, my issue is that sometimes it seems impossible to rectify them, and this makesme even more depressed! Thats enough for today I think. P.s. Notice I havent included money or possesions on this list, these are important for a lot of people, including me, but I dont think they are as big as those listed above.
