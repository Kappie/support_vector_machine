I swear, I shall bend this sad road for you   Yes, this sadness can be turned into joy Crack open your shell; I will bear your yoke This strength will prove that of a brave young boy A child isn't blindfolded to that which has broke   This life is leading to our destruction Let us see from a different colour It does not require too much instruction I promise, I will lift this smog from view   This story is leading into destruction With a rose-colour'd view, life is content Shouldn't this road go under construction? I vow to cross this arched bridge with you.  ~hoshi
