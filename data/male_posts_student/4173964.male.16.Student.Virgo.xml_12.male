Had an epiphany whilst filling a car at pump 6... Being depressed about things as trivial as high school crushes or crap like that is just a waste of energy. Shit happens ya gotta just roll with the punches and...throw them 'bows and all that good time jazz. I guess what I'm saying is I've decided not to get hung up on some girl that I barely even know. Chalk one up for those damn glands right? Oh well. Listening to Bob Marley and really wanting to get drunk. Never gonna happen judging by the current state of my social life. I always get the same thing "Oh yeah we totally should do something I call ya *insert day/time/date in general here)" And guess what they never do. Whatever. Fuck it. I'll save my liver for pickling some other night. I still feel like a dork and/or a 13 year old girl when I post on here. "Dear Diary tee hee" puhleeze. Still it feels good to get some things off my chest. I'm still working up the courage to talk about my dad. There's alot to sift through and I don't know if I'll like what I see when I get through. Listening to love songs when your single and desperate is really depressing I gotta tell ya. Well I've got nothing else to say tonight so i think I'll go play some video games...and then I wonder why I don't have a girlfriend...
