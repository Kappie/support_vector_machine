I recently searched through some of the old chats I had with old acquaintainces and I realized a couple things. One, I was a complete asshole to a kid that never deserved anything that he got... and if he's reading this, I'd like him to know that I am sorry beyond all belief. I never cut the kid slack and I really should have. Secondly, I realize that I really really miss a certain someone and the fun I used to have - talking till the sun came up, talking till there never should have been anything to talk about anymore, but now I don't much talk to that person. I guess I have my reasons. If she is reading this, I'd like her to know that I appreciate all those fun times in the past. I guess that's really all I noticed. If I ever see that kid again, I promise not to make his life a living hell. God, I was an asshole.  I just hope that I can still be a good person with the way I act now. Sometimes I really do try. And sometimes I really don't.  Oi vey.  I'm going to bed.
