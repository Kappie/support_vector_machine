In the 60s (or was it the 70s) this matter was brought to people worldwide through a commercial that featured a strange little boy, a senior-turtle, and the wisest owl alive. None of them could get to the center without biting. Recently, the issue was risen again by a badly-done CGI commercial with a giant monster and a robot. Yet, the question has been given no solid answer.   .   A few days ago, 2 days after my birthday to be exact, I was given two large things of Tootsie Pops, two of each flavor available in the market today. This opened up a door of possibilities.. Ok, just one. I took it upon myself to find out once and for all how many licks it really did take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop. (Of course, I used Kurts older brother for the test, I'm never going to be pictured)   .  Now, there are some things that must be taken into consideration before we start. You just can't pick a random Pop and start sucking. Different flavors will decide different outcomes. Flavors one doesn't like takes longer to whittle down, since you produce less saliva. That nocks off grape and raspberry for him. I also have to eliminate chocolate. Since Tootsie Rolls themselves are chocolate, it becomes difficult to tell exactly when the Tootsie Pop hits the outside air.     To produce the proper amount of saliva, I decided he'd consume my favorite flavor, orange. I personally will eat anything orange. Just by looking at this picture, I become hungry for an orange soda or one of those chocolate oranges you have to bash on a table to break apart. So, you can guess how much I wanted to get my lips on that orb of orange. Or at least I think it's colored orange. I'm color blind.But it was for science, so he got it.     To record proper data,we marked it after every lick. I was holding the camera, and  holding a cup full of milk in case he choked. Since I only have two hands, taking pictures of the paper all the time would become inconvenient.      Another matter that has to be considered is the way the Tootsie Pop is licked. Some like to shove the entire thing in their mouths and have the juices run down their throats. Others like the 30s style, where you give one side tiny little puppy licks. For scientific reasons, we decided to bring the best of both worlds and give giant licks outside of his mouth that cover the pop like a shroud. This way, he's technically licking it, but he's using the full capacity of his tongue as well.     50 licks down the road, and the Pop showed signs of shrinkage, but no major changes were made. We decided to limit the time between licking, because I did not know how the sun may have affected the chemicals inside. There's probably a reason Tootsie Pops are wrapped the way they are.     Licking went surprisingly faster then I thought it would, and at 100 licks, you could tell the the Tootsie Pop was already getting close to the end point. The Tootsie Roll inside was visible, and he said he could taste it through the layer of orange goodness. The end was near....     Or so I thought. At the 150 lick mark, the Pop has shown great some great resistance. It seemed that it was fighting back at us, and while it was a losing battle for this particular piece of candy, I couldn't help but be impressed by it's will power. It even tried to scare us by showing an odd piece of white mass, which we assumed was just a piece of the stick that came off during processing. None the less, the Tootsie Roll would be ours.  Then, finally, it came.      180 licks, and the Tootsie Roll came through. 180 licks, my friend. Now, while some may assume that the mystery is solved, I believe it's far from over. Different factors effect the overall outcome. We've already discussed the flavor factor and the licking factor. Other things to consider include temperature, the chemical formula of the Pop, how big it is, how big one's tongue is, ect. I'll tell you, this experiment was a lot tougher then one would think. The temptation to bite down was indeed great for him. But, now that we've got our answer...     YUMMY MUNCH YUMMY MUNCH YUMMY MUNCH CRUNCH!     That concludes our little experiment. While it truthly didn't take much too do, just a Tootsie Pop and some will power, it has become a major step in finding out what the hell the deal is with Tootsie Pops.
