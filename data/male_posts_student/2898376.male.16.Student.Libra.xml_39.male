I repent!!) a lot recently, what with it being the summer holidays, and I've been in contact with the Neopian population. It is mostly 12-year-old girls. And most of their signatures (little things at the ends of posts, etc.) proclaim that they cannot be labelled. Sample:       "Ok people I don't fit in any of those groups.....I can't be mas produced. I'm an original.LablesAreForCans."         To which I say: Screw you, you whiner. I have labelled you a whiner. Whether you choose to accept the label or not is irrelevent. A label is what I (and probably more people) see you as. In my eyes, you are a whiner, a goth, a fool. It doesn't matter whether you see yourself as this, the fact is that you are, no matter how much you deny it. How often do you see this?:        2 + 2 = 4   - 'No I don't!! I can be whatever I want! I'm not odd  or  even!!'      Never, that's how often. Take note, fools.       ' Neither man nor woman can be worth anything until they have discovered that they are fools.' - William Lamb and Viscount Melbourne.       (Ever notice how people respect your views if you tell them someone else said it? By the way, the above quote IS real.)
