I almost forgot what it's like to have a bass, guitar, and drums all going at it just praising God's name, and also addin' a bit of fun haha. Solos that don't even fit in, and just messing up and laughing at our own mistakes, yeah good times haha. Even though earlier in the day it was a wee bit boring, all that changed after 5pm or so. But yeah, so I'll start from the top then...    This morning I woke up at the usual 1130, and made a few phone calls to start the day. Josh and Gavin finally arranged everything to get to my place, and then made plans for next Friday to go to Head 2 Head.    After all the deen wa congee, I did my devos. I decided to read the "Give me Oil in my Lamp" booklet that I got from TC again just to read over some of the different ways of doin' devos, and still in the end did it the Lectio Divina style. So to day I read 1 John 3, which was about how to be at peace with one another in this world. It also spoke of God's command to follow his Son, and also just to love one another, and how He lives in us when we obey his commands. It's pretty cool how the Bibles interweaves. I never really noticed it until Theresa said it during Bible Study last Sunday, but it actually is so true =).    Afterwards, for the afternoon, I sat around for a long time. Originally I was plannin' to go out to downtown, but since Gavin and Josh said they would be here by 4, I decided to wait instead. Well, after talking to Jenn, Vikki, Rebecky, and a host of other people until 4, I was wondering where they were. FINALLY I decided to call Josh and he told me Gavin was supposed to tell me they wouldn't be here till 540. So yeah....I spent the whole afternoon moping, which sucked. Well in the mopage I was able to trombone for a bit, and also fiddle around with photoshop. So yeah I made this one pic of Gavin being squished by my moose, entitled "MOOSH-ZILLA!" It sent a lot of people BOLLing *hahaha Joy* and SMPGOing. Also of course it takes my stupidity to a whole new level, something that EVERYONE wants =P.    Chatting on MSN led to me and Jenn discussing the usage of the word "biter" and "biting" as in yoinking, as you can't really bite email....nor chopsticks. It's kind of like the explained one at UCC when Steve or Sergei was explaining how you can't exactly bite windmills or airflares. Also many of them got to see my amazing photoshop skills of the feared "MOOSH-ZILLA!" and oh yeah also this:     Joe: Hmm I need an idea for another photoshop project. I KNOW I'LL MAKE A POOR MUFFIN! LITERALLY!  Rebecca: Hahaha....  Joe: LOL hahahhah BRILLIANT!     That's the convo shortened a lot, as at one point I almost had to replace the muffin with a cupcake as they are easier to make. After I sent Joy the picture of the moose, she then started talking about whacky photos of herself too. Yeah so we talked about the immaturity of people like us for a while then, until she had to leave. Oh yeah, she has Fresh hat which is cool too =P.    Well after watching some Friends, and the Simpsons, Gavin and Josh FINALLY arrived. So first off we ate dinner, and then started off choosing songs with a word of prayer then began the song choosing.    Yeah during the song choosing, there were a lot of jokes including the long one about Chris Tan and his old-school music:     Joe: Hey for jokes, first day when UWO kids come back, let's play "Trading my Sorrows"  Gavin: Hahaha, yeah and then Chris would go on crazy...it'd be something like  *imitates blood vessel expanding* *Camera Zooms in*  AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH! "You're making me angry....."  Joe: "You're making me angry.......SEI LEANG JAI!"  Joe Josh and Gavin: SMPGO!!!!!!  Gavin: *imitating Chris* "I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO PLAY WORSHIP MUSIC!" *imitates piano*  Josh: NO FINGERS TOO FAT!!!! AAAAAAAH *imitates throwing of piano into congregation  Joe Josh and Gavin: SMPGO SMPGO "Lmsao" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHA HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA!     And from that we were able to make ourselves laugh for almost a full 5 minutes. Eventually we were all able to calm down, and then Josh starts looking through music again:     Josh: Ok, we could have maybe "Majesty, Always...."  Joe: LOL MAJESTY ALWAYS...IT SOUNDS LIKE MAJESTA ALWAYS HAHAHAHAHA!     And then I start to SMPGO for a bit, and yeah eventually I did stop, and then another stupid joke came up:     Gavin: Joe stop playing with your stuffed squirrel  Joe: It's not a squirrel....IT'S A MOOSE!  Gavin: Joe that thing is clearly a squirrel  Joe: NOT IF I STICK ANTLERS INTO IT! *pretends to make the squirrel go limp*         That made me and Gavin crack up for a bit, and then FINALLY we got everything done and we then find Josh looking for "One Desire" and then see him looking at some pink webpage.     Gavin and Joe: Uhh....Josh? WTG?  Josh: What? I was looking for "One Desire" and one of the pages was this  Joe: WAIT IT'S A BLOG LET'S LOOK!     Oh yeah, then AFTER that, we then began to jam.    Jamming was fun. Despite the little blips and mistakes there were, all in all good fun, and adds to the ringing in all of our ears. Aah the sound of music, er of us going deaf. It was awesome though, I almost forgot how cool having live guitar and bass sounds with drums...I've been playing to CD's too much haha. But yeah all in good times.    Then afterwards, we waited for Josh's and Gavin's parents to come pick 'em up. That was when Gavin started dying of lactose, and Josh and Gavin explained to me their comic idea of "LIMSOW!" but yeah that's for another day...whenever Josh gets the comic up and running. For now, we have Nuklear Power and MegaTokyo to entertain us all =P.    Anyways I'm out for now. Debating with Jenn what the score is.    Cya!
