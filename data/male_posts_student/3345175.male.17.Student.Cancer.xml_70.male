Because you would not like me very much after it unless we talk first.       David david david david david david david david david...*ahem*...sorry..."Sumone" was at the Catty with me last night.  Yes he was.  :D :D :D :D I cannot smile enough to tell you how happy i am right now. When he finally worked up the courage to kiss me, my heart leaped out of my chest (and boy was he surprised :P). Oh sweet Jesus.  AAAAH YAY! God i dunno how to describe it im just all...WOOH! He dances (essential), his friends are nutcases (heehee i kno i keep mentioning him "Someone", but Aaron is GOD...heehee..."sexing") who dont dislike me apparently, and he can dress himself (another essential)...and i am so not kidding the moment we kissed for the first time just topped every other kiss ive ever had in terms of excitement. Sounds a bit sad i know, but it was so romantic and i can still kinda feel him when i close my eyes.  I didnt think it was gonna happen after a while, and he'd gotten POd at me according to Jason coz id gone off with Nicola to swing dance. But when i came back we made gooooooood! And i seriously have not been so happy in a long long time, and never on this particular scale. All the badness and baggage that ive been holding onto from people, especially Ross, is just all gone. I feel all new and shit, and its prob coz i agree with David on this one: officially the best night of my life.    Then Alice's party. Was okay. Not much. I mean me, her, Erin and Vanessa peed ourselves laffin all morning this morning, but there was badness involving Johnny Daly and the TV getting fucked. Nothing to write home about, but bloody funny.
