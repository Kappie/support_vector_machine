And to my surprise, I got a B3 for my CA paper for History. But that's just one component. So after adding everything else, I should get at least A2. But still hoping to keep the A1. And adding to that. I got my straight A's for humanities by getting A1 for Geography!!! Second in class. I feel so blessed. I never thought I'd did well this CA. And I don't think I even put in half as much effort as my classmates, yet I'm doing so well. Really thankful. And the most surprising thing is that although I never actually took Geography lessons very seriously(I gave up on Geog), I actually do well every time! And for some reason, my Geog teacher actually likes me! as in she's nice to me I mean. She was just giving me a funny look when I went to her class, and didn't understand till I got my paper. hehe...at least something to be happy abt after depressing results from E.math and Chemistry.  Yesterday I met this chat friend online. She's Caithlyn(hope I didn't spell it wrongly) from Victoria, Australia! So cool! I mean to have a friend from abroad. So we just talked. I wonder why it just feels so nice to talk to someone from abroad. It's like so exciting. And to think that you could even be poles apart with the person. hehe...  Anyway, about leaving comments, what I meant was that what you people say actually mean alot to me. And it reminds me that people care. So don't stop leaving comments k? Anyway, it does help me in considering and thinking about stuff. So don't stop. And thanks once again!
