Once I got there I kinda just hung around for an hour, which was fine I guess. My first game was fairly even, we kept getting into deuce, but I he ended up winning it. Ummm.... o yeah, so the next game I had to play was against......... WES!...... lol yeah, so that was a free win for me :D. so then I we waited for many hours in the club house, which was actually kinda fun as it usually is. It's just to bad that they took out the foosbal tablel, and do you wanna know why they took it out............ well they took it out because they were afraid the club house would fall apart with the weight of the foosball table :S..... lol yeah its not exactly the greatest club house, because when your sitting out on the balcony and someone's walking around on the balcony.... the whole balcony shakes :'(. Eventually around 4:30 I had to play my first doubles game of the day. Ok one thing I have to say is that I love my serve.... because we were playing against Ettian, who is visiting from France and also won first place for last weeks tournament, and even he said "holy **** what was that?!" so I laughed after that :P. The rest of my games are being played tomorrow.    After the tournament was over everyone went over to the Bellamy's house. When I got there Wes was already in the pool getting beaten up by Erika and Bobby-Anne, so I laughed and then changed and jumped in the pool. lol ok so one thing I have to say is that.... Wes jumping over me and doing a cannon ball is pretty scary, first of all because he just started charging at me and I didn't know what he was gonna do..... then he jumped over me and then I cried.... lol. After all the little kids got into the pool and started spazzing out me, Wes, Erika, and Bobby-Anne got out :P. Then we ate our burgers and our thingy that came from Dairy Queen, then  Bobby-Anne  suggested we go back into the pool.... so me, Wes, and Erika jump in.... and guess what.... BOBBY-ANNE DIDN'T GO IN!!! so you know what we did... me and Wes grabbed her and dragged her in. After we laughed at Bobby-Anne for about ten seconds, she got out. So me and Wes dragged her back in, then she got out..... then Wes pushed her in with her towel, and that was pretty funny because when it was laying on the ground Erika said "It looks like a pile of crap" and indeed it did..... mainly because it was a brown towel :P. Not much happened after that until we all left.    Since Wes didn't have a ride home I think he had to walk all the way, which is really far for walking. Ummm.... and yeah.... I think that's all that I did today.        FUN INDEED TODAY WAS!!!
