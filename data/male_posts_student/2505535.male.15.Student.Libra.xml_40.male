Also I've been playing quite a bit of Dk 2, seeing as I bought it for Â£5 - classic game.  Oh, and my Fantomas tickets arrived today, there's gunna be a few of us going; Me, Dave, Jon, Jon's friend Paul, Matt, Brooke and Ollie, and I think my friend Ashley is gunna be there to, so that's cool.  Jon would also like everyone to go to  urlLink this  website and sign the guestbook so they look popular. They're a kick ass band.  I get a cup of tea for that last paragraph.. kinda like advertising, but go there anyway, or he'll cry.
