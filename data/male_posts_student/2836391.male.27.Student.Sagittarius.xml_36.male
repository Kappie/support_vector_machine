Yes, your votes have been counted, considered, much thought has been given, and this morning, after final consideration, the beard, and the mustache, were removed.  This has been a startling day for me. Every time I catch sight of myself in a mirror I get a shock! And when I rub where the beard was, as I often do when thinking, I suddenly remember.  It was interesting to note the reactions of people at work, and at college. A lot of people didn't actually notice until they looked twice. Once they had noticed though, everyone seemed to approve. I think that I'm the one finding it most difficult to cope with the change, as I had the beard for 6 years, and the mustache for 8.   In all, I'm feeling pretty good about the change.
