Since Thomas asked about summer reading, I thought I would answer.  Mr. Wargo and Mrs. Grey-Hatton will be teaching the senior AP classes next year.  They have not assigned you any summer reading.  However, take advantage of your freedom and free time this summer and read on your own.  Your primary focus next year will be British literature and poetry.  Perhaps this summer you can indulge yourself in more modern fiction.  You might want to focus on prize-winning book lists like Pulitzer Prize winning novels or Booker Prize winners.  Or focus on modern writers from around the world.  Another option to consider is set yourself up with a book list of classics, because I guarantee you that you'll be in lit classes in college and wish you'd taken better advantage of your free time as people allude to books and authors you've heard of (maybe) but don't really know.  A few books I'd recommend?  Reading Lolita in Tehran The God of Small Things Persopolis Love in the Time of Cholera Anything by Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Ibsen, Woolf, Hardy, Neruda Red Azalea Germinal  Have fun reading, be safe, and have a happy summer!
