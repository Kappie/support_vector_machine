    
       Last day of school today, for the weekend anyway. There’s no school tomorrow because of tutor consultation day you see. Tomorrow me, jack and Lloyd are off to Colchester, I think, to see the new Starsky and Hutch movie, so that should be quite cool. Hopefully tomorrow I’ll also open up a Lloyds TSB bank account, and get myself an Visa Electron card. Once I have that I’ll be free financially from my parents – kind of. It means I can buy stuff online without asking my parents. I tried to open an account with Halifax months ago, in the hope of getting a Solo card, but the bastards still haven’t got back to me, so fuck ‘em, I’ll go with Lloyds instead. Mum took me down to the bowns house today unlike last week, although she almost didn’t cause I didn’t make my bed this morning. But then on my way back down the street (on my paper round) I cocked it all up and missed five houses, so I had to go back and do them all, so it probably took like 15 minutes longer. Then I got back and had dinner – the Jon Carr picnic style speciality. Basically you search the cupboards and stick anything you like on a plate. I had digestives, chocolate swiss role, dairylea slice, and a packet of Worcester sauce crisps. School today was ok, not brilliant, but ok. Lloyds off at the moment with ‘back pains’ so in a couple of subjects I have no one to work with, which is a little annoying. When I got home from school today it was just me and Tori, because mum was at Richards tutor conceltation thing today. We kind of messed about a bit, racing to the bathroom se who could reach it first. I won but I let her go first anyway. Then I went in for a piss and when I came out she was hiding in my bed. So I was rolling over her, like, pretending I didn’t know she was there kinda thing. We were then talking and stuff. I love Tori, she’s great, I think she’s the only person in the whole world I can truly get on with and almost be myself. Naturaly, I prefer being around women, and as my sister I can do and say stuff to her I wouldn’t say to ‘outsiders’. I don’t think she feels the same though. She would make a great best friend I think, if she wasn’t so attached to dad and could understand my sexuality. We have such a laugh sometimes, and are so on the same wavelength. Ok, so, what was I doin today at school. Well, first IT – really boring. At the moment we’re doing a graphics topic and we have to design a garden. This lesson we had to make a list of what we want to change keep or remove – I just don’t see the point. It isn’t ICT. The only thing we ever seem to do in IT is practice using Word. Why can’t they teach as more advanced stuff and things that will make us more productive, things we actually need to know. Why make a written plan of a garden you’re going to design when you wouldn’t in real life? It’s such a waste of time. We should spend more time using the design software than writing crap that at the end of the day will be erased. Oh well, it’ll all be over soon. So, anyway, then I had Business studies, which was ok, we were just doing practice tests on finance, had to calculate and draw a break even chart. Then I had geography, which I’m really hating at the moment, it’s unbelievably boring. Then I had science, nothing special, periodic table type stuff. Finally PE, which wasn’t bad at all. I usually hate PE, bt it’s not bad at the moment because I’m doin lots of badmington, which I don’t mind much. So, today in PE we were doing badmington, and I paired up with david, I wouldn’t normaly but Lloyds not here so, I did. And were played none other than the loverly dean, and emma. [sighs] deans legs, what could be better? He really has the best set of legs on the panet, they are perfect in every way. Dean and Emma, kinda won against us, by a lot, I think, and dean came up with this really sexy phrase – “cheaky number”, meening a move which was sneaky I think. See what I meen by perfect, he says “cheaky number” in a way that makes me write about it. He was also acting very gay/camp, which is always nice to see. Wiggling his ass and stuff. [sighs again]. Me and Katie kissed a couple of times today again. I’m getting used to it, but I still don’t enjoy it. It’s a little worrying though, when you sit down, think about a kiss with the wrong sex and picture it going further (toungs I meen, not any further than that). I guess even when I younger I used to imagine having sex and kissing women, although it was always men I fancied. I was confused back them. I fancied men definatyl, but I don’t think I quite realised that ment I was gay, so before I understood gay sex and the idea that being could be really quite cool, I imagined girls. I always though I was going to get married, to a women and have kids and stuff. I don’t think that no more. When I was making my bed earlier, I sort of laid down and got to thinking that, this journal is something for me to do when I feel like it, and not some kind of thing that must be done regularly. There are no kind of rules. It’s just, if I’m bored I sit down and type what I’m thinking, what I’ve done and what I want to do. If I remember that this is something I can do to just like let it all out and not some kind of diary, which I have to keep updated, I should get on with it a lot better. Right, I’m off to watch the telly now – Tara,
