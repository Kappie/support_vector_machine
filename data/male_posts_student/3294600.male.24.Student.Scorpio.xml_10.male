I managed to easily find a parking space, which surprised me; others must have been late today.      Jerryn lifted his shirt a lot again today.  I am pretending not to pay attention so I think he keeps doing it until he knows I have seen it for sure.  Not sure, just my hunch.  After class Jackie, Jerryn, and I hung out and give eachother bad times.  I called Jerryn "no-butt" today because I checked his ass out for the first time, mostly because Jackie told me he didn't have one.  He said, "I have one, I just hide."  I said, "Yeah, right, like a turtle?"  He said, "No, it's hidden by the baggie pants."  I might have to ask him to prove that.  It was nice knowing these two know me and like me for who I am.  Ironic that I had thought that on the way to the computer lab.    Reason I say ironic because Jerryn and I were hanging out in the library, when a couple or regulars joined out table.  After a while of silence, this girl all the guys at school think is hot and she got a scholarship at some college to be a cheerleader says, "You hear they're now letting gays get married in Massachusetts?"  I had no idea why she looked right at me.  She paused for a reaction, thankfully the other guy said, "Yeah."  She said, "It makes me sick; they should all die."  My eyes met with Jerryn's and he obviously wasn't pleased.  The other guy said, "Or at least put on an island by themselves."  I couldn't believe it.  Jerryn said his opinion about how everyone should be allowed to do whatever they want and so on.  The awkwardness was short because it was time for them to go to class.  Jerryn really is into this girl, at least physically.  After they left another guy came up to the table that didn't hear anything and made some comment on how hot she is.  Jerryn said, "I can't believe the hate and crap that just came out of her mouth."  I think his view of her has changed a bit.  He had class, but flashed me a smile like everything is going to be okay and told me he would see me tomorrow.  I went on reading like I did during the whole conversation 'til I finished the book.  Classes went well today.  During my web design class I removed my blinder to try to see where our instructor is coming from with our final project.  He asked if everyone was okay with what he came up with and I told him I personally am not.  I'm not interested in science that much and don't feel I would do that great of a job.  I have no reason to get to know the instructors in the Science Department because I will never take classes from them.  He said, "That's fair."  He went on to give other examples of pages available that we can take ownership of and create or repair.  I asked if a specific instructor already had a page and he said no.  I said, "I'll talk with my instructor and see if it would be okay for me to do hers."  He said great.  He went on to explain he knows we can make pages, that's not his intent.  His intents is for us to view this as having a client and taking our skills and applying it to their demand.  Which clicked.  I'm glad I wasn't a closed door to this, because now that he explains it, I think it's cool.  Before that last class of the day, I called Dale to see if he wanted to grab a bite and he said he was going to make dinner.  I told all my classmates my roommate was cooking dinner.  I have no idea why, but I did.  He made pork chops, baked beans, and bread.  It was yummy!  Now I'm home chatting with Jackie and chilling on-line about to work on homework.  I don't know how I'm going to interact with those people anymore in the library.  Even more, I wonder what effect this will have about Jerryn's interest in Miss I'm A Cheerleader.
