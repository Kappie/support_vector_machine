In any case, they are walking down the street one day when they notice a flyer in a storefront window offering up a reward for "information that leads to the arrest" of a criminal - probably someone who has been robbing gas stations or mugging old women.  They devise a plan to make the reward money (maybe five thousand dollars or so).  They will get jobs at a 7-11 or dress up as old women to bait the thief into attacking them.  From there, they will capture the guy and bring him to the police for the reward.  I don't know whether it would be better for their plan to work, and that they get the money, or else for it to fail miserably, and maybe they get beat up or something and the guy gets away.  Either way, I think it might be a good idea...
