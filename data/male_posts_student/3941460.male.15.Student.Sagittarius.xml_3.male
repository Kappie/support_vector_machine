I'll just kind of sum up my old blog, which I was tryingto make on my own, and failing at doing so. (I gave up on it and decided to go for something simpler...which lead me here.)    Anyway, in a nutshell, I talked about my current girlfriend (a lot), the beautiful and very amazing Allison. I pretty much pointed out all the good times, along with the bad. A few, of the good ones,to make note of here are LIPS and tour...fun stuff, and most of you reading this will know what those are...so yeah, no need to explain. And yeah, I also mentioned my friends, my family, God, my struggles and issues, things I was feeling, things I was thinking...the works. (If you really want to catch up on all of that, go to  urlLink http://hawkblog.vze.com . Oh, and sorry if not everything works or whatever. I kind of quit half-way through trying to fix it.)    Anyway, it's 11:43, so that explains why I'm tired...that and I spent all day watching little fourth graders run around an amusement park/water park in Wisconsin, along with spending four hours on a bus next to a little, hyper kid.    And sad? Well, Alli is leaving tomorrow morning...early...to head up to Canada for a week. No phone up there, no internet, no way of communicating with her at all pretty much. I'm going to miss her so much. But, I also feel bad for her...stuck up there with five movies to last her the week. (She's four hours from civilization, and all she can do, pretty much, is fish.) Hopefully I'll live; hopefully she'll live. I did, however, sign up to work all of next week...so that should keep me busy at least. And, it means I get more cash...whichis never a bad thing.        Well, it's almost tomorrow...so I'm going to head out. G'night, everyone.
