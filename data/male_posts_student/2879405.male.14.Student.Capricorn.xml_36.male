Although they had lost their crucial game in the semi-finals against RI, the spirit and passion was enough to beat off Chinese High 8-7 which was more than enough to give Bro.Anthony a good one, and to show denis koh what softballers have that he doesn't have. Now, the B Boys of Maris Stella High Softball Team have gotten and truly remarkable 3rd placing in the Inter-Schools Nationals Softball Competition. I was there to witness, the twist of fate. Gabriel and Bertram had no doubt contributed the lion's share of the team's success. I would like to thank Gabriel for his outstanding 2/3 grandslamwhich gave us 6-7, trailing them very closely. I also appreciated what Bertram had taught me to become what i am today in the softball team, and for pitching in his last game in Maris Stella High, in which he did superbly well. The pitching in the 1st inning was formidable. All strike outs in the 1st inning. What more could he ask for?? The weather was also perfect. Chinese High's batting form was lousier than you though so. Having gone through so much pain and scolding, sweat and bruises, our  B Boys proved that they were no weaklings by showing excellent skills in their last and final game in Maris Stella High! The sec.4 boys can now concentrate on their 'O' levels.  I will miss them for the Saturdays training.  Wishing them all the best for their exams. For those trying to make it to RJC, the Ri coach was there to pick his catch. Work harder and Good Luck! Like how we make it to the 3rd placing.
