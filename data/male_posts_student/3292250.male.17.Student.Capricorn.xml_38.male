But in my case they're all "I Am What I Am", which is like  the  song for gay pride, so I guess that makes it totally acceptable. So all of you proud gay people go and get at least one version of the song. It's great. Oh, and don't mind my silly posts today. I've had a good day that involved lots of Diet Coke.
