I happily obliged, and ziploced the proper dosage and started my long walk there. (2 minutes tops)  She instructed me to go to her classroom, but as I went by the fence I noticed a dark forboding sign that said, slightly paraphrased, "Anyone who dares to bring Tylenol to their sister without going to the main office first will be castrated".  Caring quite a bit about my gonads, I began a hunt to find the main office, which was conveniently in the first place I looked. It was also in the last place I looked as well.  In the very petite office, I spotted Friendly Neighbor Bridget (FNB for short) behind a desk which, by its name plate, belonged to a woman named Barbara. I informed FNB of my mission, and she told me I was a dumb dumb man. In other words, she looked at me with fear and said, "Are you 18?" Clearly this is age discrimination, but because of the F in FNB I had no fear. I asked what could be done and she said that maybe she was on Sarah's emergency contact list, which she was, which would seem to end the mission.  On the way out however, I was spotted by El Carmelo Elementary School Principal Lupe Garcia, formerly Jordan Middle School Principal Lupe Garcia, who, by some bizarre cruel luck, remembered me. He engaged in me in a painfully long conversation about me for approxamitley 15 minutes to a day. Then of course since I can't be rude, I had to ask how he was, which almost lead into a long talk where I would have had to pretend to care about someone who was a very distant part of my life for a mere year.  I then proceeded to walk home and write this. My life is so thrilling.
