Sit down and wait until you have to go outside to another place where people tell you what to do in exchange for money. Ready....and...NOW! Go outside and go to the place where people tell you what to do in exchange for money. When you're hungry, eat. Don't love. And don't sing. When you've managed to live long enough to be allowed to leave the place where they tell you what to do in exchange for money, go back outside. Don't go home yet. Try to figure something out. Aaaaand...good enough. Go home and find something to sit down on. When you're hungry, eat. Don't love. And don't sing. If you are sleepy, find something to lay down on. Dream about razor wire.  Happy Open Up Your Eyes Day!  -Dice Squirrel I think that worked rather well, don't you? Visit her/his/its site!
