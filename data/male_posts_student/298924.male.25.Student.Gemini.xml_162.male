Okay....so having read  urlLink Raj's latest tale of Swarth  I have officially placed him in the Hall of Fame with imaginary characters such as Shaft and Tyler Durden....  Okay so I have tests coming up on Monday and Tuesday....Round 2 might go to Atta and company as I haven't devoted myself as thoroughly as I needed to....but this has been a fun filled block....one of those blocks that will happen when you learn more outside the classroom than in it....  I need to update my links....as all of my inactive friends are now once again active....hello to the approximately 4 people who take the time to read this rag....the days of blogspot are drawing to a close.....Killacal.net is closer than you think....  In the mean while read some of my old stuff to keep you entertained....
