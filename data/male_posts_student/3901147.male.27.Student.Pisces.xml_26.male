How would you like your sex life and sensitivity to be 100 times better than you have now!?  Too late for you; but you can help your boys.  Don't circumcise.  Most of us don't know what we are missing so that is fine and dandy... however, if you are disatisfied with what you do have.. try searching for Foreskin Restoration on the internet.  Many good sites out there and I started it a couple years ago.  It helps!  Though it is no true replacement for what we lost it will do and is better than nothing.  Rob
