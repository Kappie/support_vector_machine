I hope Bobbie and I are able to go to the movies again sometime. Maybe I can go to her house, she could come here, the world never knows what will happen. Only clue as to what Bobbie and I did yesterday at the movies is, she is a really good kisser :P.  "It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life."
