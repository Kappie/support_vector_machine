The Diamondbacks committed four errors on Wednesday night. After the team played an error-free game on Thursday, Brenly smiled and proclaimed, 'No errors! We get pizza!'   "Then he walked out the interview room door. They were his last comments to the media as Diamondbacks' manager."  Bob Brenly is my new hero.
