Junkmail and one email from Ratemyteachers and one from Bell. Now I'm just here blogging. Safee is an asshole. Long story.  Bethel tonight. Yay~ Murder Mystery Nite. Very cool. Sounds like fun. Probably will be. Nima said he'd come but I don't know if he really is coming. Sounds busy tonight. Whatever. He's not sure if he can call so I doubt he'll be showing at Bethel after all. Blah, whatever.   He said he was considering being a Christian but it's because of the 7 years of chaos and crap. Sounds like pretty much the same reason to me... but... I hope that while he's considering, he'll find a passion for God. Then, I can share my greatest Love with him and we can worship Him together. *sighzZ* Too much hoping. Bleh.  So bored. Bored to DEATH. Cheese. Meh, whatever. Gonna go on Friendster for a while or whatever. So bored. I could die.
