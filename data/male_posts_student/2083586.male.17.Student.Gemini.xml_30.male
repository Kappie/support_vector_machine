As of right this second stuff is good, I have my friends, my music, my bed, my lady friend, and my blog. Simple as that. Sorta. What to say...What to say... I dunno I'm not good at talking "Me and words aren't goodly." (HA! tell me what movie that's from and i'll be surprized).  Well as far as my music goes, I listen to it I play it and I try to write it. Most of my attempts at wrinting fail, but I have two good ones. I'm not in a band, but I'm involved in a little side project with Austin, we're called Music in the AM, we have one song...kinda sad but we've only met to write and play under that name once so it's cool. I really want to convince Austin that we should get people to play with us and play at battle of the bands, but I don't think he'll do it. I'm looking to join or start a new band but as of yet I've been rather unsuccessful, so if you have any leads call me or IM me.  Fun stuff I guess. Well I'm gonna check out, I'll see you around I guess.                                                                                                                   -mike
