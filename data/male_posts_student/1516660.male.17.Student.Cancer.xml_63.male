Since I have very limited music knowledge, I know nothing of almost every songs. They decided on "Qing Fei De Yi" by Harlem Yu. Since I only know the chorus, for the rest of the songs, I was supposed to do actions.   It was really funny man! I can't really describe it, but it made the whole choir crack up laughing! And we got thunderous applause! Okay, I kua zhang a bit. Colin told me that my acting skills were very good, and I am very brave, since "few boys would do what I did". I did those actions that Yit Hann would only do...those sao huo kind la!   LOL! Really enjoyed myself down there! HaHa! I would  DEFINITELY  do it next time. Provided there is a next time.
