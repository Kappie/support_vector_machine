And the thing that sucks the most is that the test were both right after the long weekend:( Oh well I don't think i did so good on my science test but I definetly did better on my math test:)  Well Calgary gave Tampa Bay a ROYAL WHOOPING!!! last night they schooled Tampa Bay 4-1 and took a 1-0 series lead in the stanley cup final!!  I think i'm gonna draw a pic depicting the Lightning getting BURNED!! OH YA!  Not much else happened today but I'll keep you updated better from now on unless my comp. goes on the fritz and the internet doesn't work but that I'll just play by ear... (My comp. has been known to fuck up)  Keep on rocking in the free world!!
