Cory is out of summer school so he'll have more time to work with the comics and I'm slowly piecing together some of the scripts for later comics. The only road block we currently have is that Cory will be out for some time during the month of August doing family trips and I'm not fully sure when he'll get back, but we're going to try to piece things together soon enough.   Now that I think of it, Cory and I have to finish up his makeup work for video, I've got to work days to record a demo, record the demo, have a gig on the twentieth of August (of which if you feel like coming, visit our website which is still under development - www.void-music.com - for details), and and have some time leftover for the comic.   It appears that after all, not much work is going to get done during August, possibly, but it's all fitting together and we never know.  Keep your eyes peeled.
