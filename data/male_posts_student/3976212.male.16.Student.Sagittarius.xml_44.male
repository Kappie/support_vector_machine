Lots of people have been wanting the weather to turn to rain cause of our recent heat wave...30+ weather is nice-but not for too long. I'm not saying I don't want it back! I'm just welcoming a little change, I think most are. Accept for those in Alberta-cause they got tornado clouds. Ehh well that aint good. A social worker came here today...She is (finally) responding to the phone call I made a month ago when my dad abandoned me. Things are alright now obviously. My dad wasn't too fun...didn't even have a shower. I submitted this site for Google AdSence. I would be able to do way more to this site if I had some money coming in...Like getting a real host! I don't want this site going down cause of bandwidth issues. My current free host is alright...they don't require any advertising, the speed is fine and the space is also good. The bandwidth is adequte, but I think they are making it unlimited now? I'm not 100% sure.
