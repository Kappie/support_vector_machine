"can you stop saying that? i dun wan to start hating you or find you irritating" so what can i say. she say i dun understand her. fine. i dun say that i know everything about her or that i know exactly how she feels. i try to. but i'm not her. i dunno what she really wants. and she doesn't tell me. i mean i try man i tried.. and.. i dunno if she really try to understand what i am goin thru.  when she said that, my eyes started to fill... but i know i can't cry. i mean not in the living room. not in front of my parents. not in front of my sis.. what else can i say but sorry.. and sorry i am.. for giving her pressure.. for saying i love her.. for telling her i miss her.. for letting her know that i really need her back at my side.. from now on, i will try.. really try to stop telling her how i feel.. even if it tear me up all the way.. i will just keep my damn mouth shut.. haiz..  i think it's a week since my headache started.. it's been here a week.. somethings wrong with me.. i can even trip when walking.. over my own legs!! that's like so amazing.. maybe it's the lack of sleep.. maybe it's cos i miss a certain someone too much.. maybe it's cos it's a sign that my legs are goin to give way.. maybe maybe maybe.. life's full of maybes... she gave me hope.. and she took that hope away.. she brought colour into my life.. and she also took it away.. in life.. if there's no hope.. there's nothing to live for.. now.. many questions.. why am i here.. if i am gone, who will miss me(i'm not thinking of suicide la).. and.. more and more.. it's so stupid.. i'm like a "bird that cannot fly" a person without hope.. nothing to live for.. haiz.. life is so depressing d you think..
