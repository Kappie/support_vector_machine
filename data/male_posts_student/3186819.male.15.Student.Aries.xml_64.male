For some unknown reason, my mom, her boyfriend, and the neighbours were outside. I was sitting quietly in my room, doing nothing really. But then I get called downstairs to bring some music outside to where they were sitting. Maybe if I didn't get called down. this wouldn't of happened. But anyways, when I got there they all asked me to stay and drink and eat with them (they being mom, her b/f, and neighbours). So, on poor judgement, I drank some scotch and some whiskey (I didn't even get tipsy or drunk, just a little red. With my weight it takes uber alcohol to get me drunk, and I've never been drunk). So this carries on outside for a while.  Around 12:30AM it wrapped up, and my mom was feeling a little ill. So her boyfriend helped her to the bathroom while I got her a glass of water (an important detail, the water). So while waiting to give her the water, out of nowhere came this SHREEK from my sister's bedroom. He was yelling (like SHREEKING YELLING) at her "WHY DID YOU SPILL FUCKING WAX ON THE FUCKING CARPET, YOU FUCKING BITCH" (that is quite close, if not exactly what he said). I had spilt the wax, so I claimed the blame for it, to take some heat off my sister. After saying I had, he came at me, with this odd look in his eyes, with his hands outstretched towards my neck. Instincively, I did what I had to to defend myself. I through the water at him and just ran the the stairs. He POUNCED at me and started strangling me. I kicked him in the testicles a few times (I guess either he doesn't have them or the adrenaline kept him from feeling pain). We tumbled down the stairs and he got me in a headlock which he claimed was to "Calm me down". Hmm, do you grab a bulls neck to call him down, do you poke a dog to make him calm down? NO! So eventually I was able to place another kick and I am assuming I hit something important. I broke free, RAN upstairs. I jammed my door in its frame so it would take a lot of force to open it, all the time hearing my mom's boyfriend saying "You're through! Your DONE!", which I interpreted as "Your Dead". Sp then I tried to get on the phone, to call either Children's Aid, the Police, or Kids Help Phone". My sister was on the phone and wouldn't get off.   And then my mother, the next morning, wanted me to wish him a happy fathers day! FUCK NO! I should've said, I just said "I am not speaking to that formfill that claims to be human". For some reason we ended up all of us going out for breakfast. I WOULDN'T LOOK AT HIM. And after all this my mom had the audicity to say "It was both your faults". Yes, I JUST BEGGED HIM TO STRANGLE ME!   So the next day at school, I tried my best to hide the bruises. I kept my head down (like even when walking, staring at the ground so it hid my neck). Then on my way to second period, my principal stopped me in the hallway and said "This is the second time today I have seen you with your head way down". So we stepped into her office, and for the first time that day I lifted my head and she saw the bruises. I scrambled to make an excuse, but nothing came. I just told the truth. She looked extremely worried and then I stayed in her office until The Children's Aid Society (which is Ontario's version of what "Child Welfare" and "Child and Social Services" are) got to my school. Then we I had a long interview with Sherri Comeau, the CAS worker on my case. We went out to lunch, tried to get ahold of my mom, nothing. It was crunch time. The CAS office closes at 4:30. If I could get a hold of my mom before they closed I would be forced into a foster placement until my mom was ready to take me back. At 4:27 miraculously I got ahold of my mother.   She came down and she said to me in the van "The one thing I never wanted was to chose between you and him, but you've made me". I wanted to rebut that, but she was too upset I thought it best to shut up. I would've said "I didn't ask for him to choke me, it is not my fault, I didn't ask for Children's Aid, I tried to hide the bruises, I DIDN'T MAKE YOU CHOSE, THEY DID" but that wouldnt've flown over too well. Something like a restraining order was put on my mom's b/f and he was not allowed near me until the investigation was finished. I had a tough choice to face. I used the excuse "the emotional trauma fogged my view of the situation" to change my story with the police. I ended up saying that "I preemptively thew the water and originally he had no intention of hurting me". I said that of course to make sure my mom didn't suffer any more than they had to. The police photographed my bruises. I kinda had the option of pressing charges or not. I decided I wanted it over with, no more drama. So I decided to NOT press charges. The investigation was closed, he was never forced to take anger management or parenting classes, and now I feel as if he is a ticking timebomb ready to go off again.   This starts bugging me often...Especially around father's day. This wasn't the first time he abused me, either. Before my mom, sister, and I had moved out to Ontario, when we were in Alberta, I locked myself in the bathroom to get away from him. When I opened the door he pounce for the neck again, and then my mom's excuse was "He was trying to shield your head from cracking on the bathroom floor"....That wouldnt've been necessary if he hadn't pounced at me. THEN HE CHASED ME AROUND THE HOUSE, yelling insults like Fatty.   The thing that bothers me most is that at times my mother says that I AM THE ABUSER. Hmm, who was the one that strangled and chased me, HER BOYFRIEND. Who was the one that played mindgames and was almost cheating on her, running of to swingers parties without telling her and against her wishes, and putting her in the hospital because of the stress that caused. And she wound up in the hospital again, and while she was in there her boyfriend tried to sell her "favourite" (I use the term losely) dog. I've said it before and I'll say it again. He is an abuser, plain and simple.  So why has this been bothering me? I don't know. It is good to get it off my chest, but the thing is my failsafe defense if I ever get attackted by a male failed. If I ever got attacked by a male, my defense was KICK THEM IN THE TESTICLES. It is plaing dirty, but what do I care, if I get out of a situation, I get out of a situation. I kicked, but nothing happened. I need better defense mechanisms, and fast. Anyone have suggestions, or comments to the situation that happened?
