I stayed up waiting for my  mate to come round, and the bastard came round to late!!!! (He gave me a funny look, then called me a 'Paed' cause I made a typo!!)  Then we went on the PC, went on the ps2 and i fell asleep for two hours, ate my dinner, then we went to the shop, bought red bull!!!! And we're here...  This rules!
