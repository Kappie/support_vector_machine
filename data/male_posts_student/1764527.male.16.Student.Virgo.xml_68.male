 I think I flubbed the interview today (for Oasis Youth Council). I messed up my answers for a few questions, but I don't know. The lady in charge of the OYC knew me from a previous volunteer job there and she seemed to be feelin' my answers. But, of course, Robin kept one-upping my answers and then says, "well, I don't think I can really do it because I'm gonna be doing Mayor's Youth Council." Argh, she gets on my nerves. But, the funniest thing about it was that afterwards, my dad was supposed to pick me up but he went to the NCCJ offices to get me. He was mad and cussin' at me and everything. I was scured. 
 Random Rant:  Why the hell did George  W.  Bush have to come to Nashville in the middle of rush hour? Traffic was an effe'ing nightmare about 3:20 and the interstate (24/40E) was completely stopped. The bridges downtown were backed up across the river. The list of nightmares goes on. Ugh, and all he was here for was to make some damned money for the Republican party. Why is he the only President that actually goes out and does so many dinner/fund-raisers? The two times he's been to Nashville as President he's stopped by an East Nashville school and made some blood-money for the Republican party. Can't he do that from Washington? Can y'all tell I don't like  W ? 
 Aite, I'm gonna try to find out how I'm gonna do my poetry response for English when I don't have poems and then I'm going to go to bed. Plus, I'm gonna talk to the future mother of my child(ren). Y'all know who that is...
