I thought that was cool so I made another script to plot your coordinates on a map, of which there is are  urlLink big  and  urlLink small  versions.  It's not accurate with 100% of IPs, but it often gets them right, or their state right at the very least.  If anyone complains it plotted them wrong, I will have to do like  urlLink these Nigerians  and have you attacked by a domesticated baboon or hyena.
