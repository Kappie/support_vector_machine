However, I gotta stop doing that so often...its not good. From this day on, I will only do it MAXIMUM once a week (right now I'm at 3 a week on average for the last 3 weeks). You know what's really smutty...bob's famous quote, "I hate girls with boyfriends...there's no use in talking to them!" Seriously...there is no use in talknig to them. I stop.
