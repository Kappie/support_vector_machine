Well, if you have, be careful there's lots of scammers who do just this! They send you an email that will say to click on a link to eBay, or American Express or where ever and ask you to type in your credit card number because it's expiring, but really, the URL could take you to a completely different, unsecure webiste just so they can get your credit card number!  Well, there's a very helpfull tool to help you prevent getting majorly scammed like this!  I heard of this little tip while watching an episode of  urlLink The Screen Savers  which is a very informative, neat tech related TV show on the best channel on the planet,  urlLink G4TechTV   Anyhow, back to SpoofStick, it's a little toolbar type thing that is added to your broswer that tells you what site you're REALLY on so if these scammers try to take you to a link that isn't what they say, you can get the hell out of there!  It's a free download, doesn't take too long by the way. You can download it  urlLink here   Another freebie too :)  Oh, and it only is available to download for Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox browsers.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
