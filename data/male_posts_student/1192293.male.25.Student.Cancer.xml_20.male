Damn you and your bullshit war, Bush.  His blood and that of every other person killed in this greed-fueled vendetta is on your hands.   When In Doubt, Spin.  Anyone remember when this war was supposedly about getting rid of Iraq's weapons of mass distraction er, distruction?  Now, all of a sudden, I see the unelected shrub on the news with our British lap-dog talking about liberating the Iraqi people...  Tell me, U.N. Security Council resolution 1441, did that say anything about liberating them from the oppressive Hussein regime? Not that Hussein isn't one evil fuck of a person, but the main  legal  justification for this war was 1441, a document that was all about weapons and disarmament.  I am pretty sure it didn't say anything about liberating anyone.  Maybe this sudden change in tack has something to do with the fact that they have captured 75% of the country and haven't found so much as a used kleenex, let alone any kind of cache of Biological weapons capable of reaching the U.S.  Ask the kid from the article above this one whether he feels liberated or not.  And if Saddam is so evil that we have to liberate his people, where does our sense of "moral decency" draw the line?  Does it draw the line in Saudi Arabia, where they regularly send money to terrorist groups?  Does it end in Chinese occupied Tibet where Buddhist nuns are sexualy assaulted with tasers?  Or what about Iran, where a woman can be stoned to death if her husband, just one man, says she has been unfaithful?  If liberation truly is the desire of the current American "regime", why are Bush and his fellow autocrat-wannabees trying to introduce the Patriot II act, a document that guarantees the sharpest decline in personal freedoms that this country has ever seen?  If he was telling the truth about a will for liberation, we could be in for the most enormous, cataclysmic war the world has ever seen.  Fortunately for us, Bush is about as aquainted with the truth as a blind man is with the beauty of a Piccasso.  And during all of this, where is our mighty free press?  Oh yeah, they're whores.  I forgot.  Why disagree with our government when our corporate overlords will fire us for it.  That's right.  For all you media prostitutes out there, to paraphrase Scott Adams, here's a tic tac box, keep your concience in it.  Knowing our press, they should have plenty of room for their sense of decency and sense of duty as well.  P.S. -  They had the extreme bad taste to do this press suck-off from Northern Ireland, a counrty ripped apart by it's own attempts at liberation.  Way to go Bush, I set the bar extremely low for you, and you keep surprising me with how low you get.
