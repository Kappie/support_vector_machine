      Why do people want to pretend like their some else? I mean wow, you have to be really evil to pretend you someone else, then post a thread on gmailswap as that person, and try to get gmail invations. Listen I you want a gmail invite that much why don't you just ask? Theres plenty.   

      kill blogpost.exe
