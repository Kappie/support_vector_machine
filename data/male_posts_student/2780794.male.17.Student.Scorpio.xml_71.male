Some decided to go Mohamed Sultan road for some beer while others suggested geylang for some fun. -=[ehz dei, please refrain from doing these stuffz ahz...]=- In the end, they ended up at Holland Road eating at KFC. -=[Nasib baik nie budakÂ² tau makan makanan yg halal. ]=- Anyway,these dudes were not as good as u think. After their kiddy meal, they went into "hyperdrive" probably due to some hormone rage caused by some amino acids in KFC's Hot and Crispy chicken. hmm...as for the belly dancers.....FUUYOOO!!!! They were a fest! Gyrating away like some motor-powered barbie doll was a turn-on to many. Even A-che-min a.k.a manja kid was picking up the feathers that dropped from their costumes! WOOHOOOOOO! -=[Jangan matair tau sudah ehz?]=- Don't you think it was a waste? zzzzzz~ i'm gonna chill out at Mohamed Sultan with a bottle of Carlsberg now...adioz~
