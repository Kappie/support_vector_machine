I have heard about the search for the largest Mersenne Prime quite a few times and yesterday in class we discussed it.  Well theres a program you are able to run on your own machines, very similar to the SETI project, but there's a catch!   If you are the person who finds the first Mersenne Prime with 10 million digits you win $100,000.  Well knowing that i've already started!  i can't imagine what the current number is up to since p = 7.1 megs in text format!  p, as in 2^p-1.  It's a long friggin # but hopefully i'll get it and run off to Sweden!
