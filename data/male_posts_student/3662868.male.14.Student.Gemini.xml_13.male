My dad needed the car for something, and I was mad that I couldn't get it. Sounds like a case of the "I wants", right? Well, yeah, sounds dumb, but then my dad starts bitching to me about the 500$ I got for my birthday. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Then he says "I love you, but I'm not rich". -_- This obviously shows me that he wasn't paying attention. I wasn't asking for him to get the game for me, I just needed a way to get to Gamestop. I want your comments people, and I want em today. Should I embark on my own journey to Gamestop and get it myself. Or should I wait and let everyone else get a day to get that much more good at the game so I can just really suck ass when I get it?
