It was a warm night in the borrows of Havana, we were going to the movie theaters and we were going to see some action flick. As I sat there hopelessly engaged on the screen. I fell captivated, almost compelled to watch movies. But it would be almost a decade before the little cuban kid to sit down in front of a 20 foot screen with Dobly Surround Sound. Well I just finished watching Spider Man 2, and it was worth every penny. Me being somewhat of a sound freak, actually  liked  the sound( love  is just a strong word, and no I don't have any problems with commitment).Even if the cinematic of the movie is breath taking, it will sink  period . In other words, if you don't have good sound then you ain't got (pardon the French) jack-shit.
