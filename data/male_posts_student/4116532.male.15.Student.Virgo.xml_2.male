Visited my parents, my cousions, my grand'ma and all was well, even tho my Dad didn't feel well, but atleast now he feels better.  On saturday, we went to IKEA with my cousions, and it was fun, I've seen my cousion who really changed and became a HipHop fan and dresses like one. we had our fun there but when we came to the registers...a line of 2 hours...after that, back to my sister's  Today, it started ok, went to my sister's husband's working place, but everything went wrong we went to pick up my nephew from his grand'ma. He said some things a son should never say to a father. At home everything went from bad to worse, my sister had a fight with her husband, it quieted down but things turned to be even worse later that day, and now she wont stop crying... why can't things stay all well forever? and plus on that, now my nephew won't let me sit near the computer, almost..because if I ask to sit, he crys to his mom and she tells me to back off.  :(
