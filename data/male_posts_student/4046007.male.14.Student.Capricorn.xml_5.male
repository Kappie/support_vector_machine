DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. my parents wouldnt let me play, but because of my persistence in joining, they eventually just caved in. do you know how many people got severely injured last year playing football? 2. if you are too weak go hit the weight room. its free. if you are really out of shape go to both workouts. hey im a twig. im doing football. you wanna know why? because i like the sport and i dont want my school to be a pushover school thats dissed in all areas of athletics. so if you are gonna complain about our football team, first consider how well you would do on it.
