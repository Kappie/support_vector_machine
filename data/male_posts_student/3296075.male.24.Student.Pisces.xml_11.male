We're gonna make a cut down to the Berry Islands (Still the bahamas) and spend a good while down there.  Our ultimate plan is to hold out for as long as we can on a deserted island, which there are plenty of.  After that we'll be heading back to florida, hopefully not until august. Finally found a cheap place to stay the night actually has free water and electricity and cable if we had a TV. And theres a free wireless internet connection, versus the 20$ i have been paying.  However after tommorow, it really will be a long time before we see the internet again. Since thats the case I'm gonna put up a post where everybody can just start putting comments up about whats going on back home, bets as to how long we will make it and just general chat between everybody so that when we do get another chance to check it we will have a lot to read. It is kinda lonely on the boat afterall. I'll also put up a couple more pics before we go.
