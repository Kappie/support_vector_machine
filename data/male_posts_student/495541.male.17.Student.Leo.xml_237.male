What had happened was someone was in a car accident and we drove by it.   "I hope it's not somebody we know."   The song was "The News" by Jack Johnson.  I felt that comment was sad.  It made me wonder if they even cared about the person if they weren't someone they knew.  I think that shows how we've become desensitized to people's injuries or hurt or pain or their problems in general if we don't know them.  We don't care about anyone but the people we know.  There's no... "Wow what can I do to help that person."  It's... "Do I know that person... Because then I'll help them."  I do it all the time.  And that is bad.  The song goes like this:   Why don't the newscasters cry when they read about people who die?  At least they could be decent enough to put just a tear in their eyes  Mama said  It's just make believe  You cant believe everything you see  So baby close your eyes to the lullabies  On the news tonight   It makes me want to cry.
