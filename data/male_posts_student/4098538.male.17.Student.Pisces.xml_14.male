That was pretty cool 'cause we were in there for hours and I had quite a few! So I was a little drunk when I got home.I went to Jilly's again last night and got a bit overly drunk there too... not good. But I had a lot of fun last night! We left at about 1.30 and realised we (Mandy and I) had an hour and a half to kill, so um... yeah. Wow. Probably the most fun I have had in an hour and a half. Then we walked into the town centre to catch a bus. On the way, I decided to run up a car and jump off the back and I kinda smashed my heel up. It's agony to walk! So we got into the centre at about 3.00 and I was hobbling around and everyone thought I was a homeless bum or something. But I started laughing at some guy for giving some cigarettes to a girl in a short skirt for some reason... don't ask. The bus journey seemed to last 5 minutes. Thenwe had to walk home on the slippy ice which was so fucked! Butwe fell straight asleep when I got home! So it was a nice night apart from smashing my heel up. And now I'm sat here unable to walk, but I have Dr. Pepper, so it's ok.
