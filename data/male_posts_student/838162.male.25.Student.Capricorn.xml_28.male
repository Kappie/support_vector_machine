It started out wonderful, but since then I’ve been challenged and tested emotionally, mentally and even physically. Coming to the New Year, I’m still learning and recovering from what i have learned and experienced.   In light of this, i can only have high hopes for 2003. It can't be as bad as the year i just had and with new beginnings and responsibilities, I can make the best of things.  The first step would be to compile a list of goals and resolutions that i want to accomplish next year. This time around I’ll be sure to keep to it better than this year.(if I remember correctly, I only got one thing done.) no more excuses, have much more time on my hands to get them done this time around.  Here is a sample of the things i have on my list.    Do driving lessons    Learn some cooking and house keeping skills   Improve my programming skills   Forge closer ties with my current friends   Find a well-balanced social group (interest group) that I can be a part of and network from   Improve myself by going regularly to the gym and maybe taking up a sport   Learn some finance and investment skills   Improve my Bible knowledge  and so forth…    Well it’s now official and online. I can’t escape from this anymore. We shall see in a year’s time how I have done, then you all can berate me if I don’t make it.    “CLEO, take note, tag current journal entry for extraction from archive in 12 months”    >  That’s it for me for this post, what could be the last post for 2002. One good thing that did come out from all that was this blog itself. I will continue to update and improve on it in the on-coming year. See you in the future.   >
