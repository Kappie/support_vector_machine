School first, I have decide to change my major to eBiz Mgt. Man, I have to extend another 6 months more. Cos , I have to do eBiz Fundamentals as my basic subject. I dunn mind actually. If I am extending. I just known this lovely, petite gal. Nope nope .. to that extend that I wanna a new relationship. Just befriends only , not more than that. I have enough of one. She is good to me.  Cos, yupz. I have so much fun cooking in the kitchen in Campus East... Actually, I do notice her last session BBQ. She do has the similiarity to Caroline Cheong. Only till now, got to chat with her, last Saturday. Cool gal.  Ops, my galfriend would be jealous if she read this. Confirm. I am just lonely here, need some friends...
