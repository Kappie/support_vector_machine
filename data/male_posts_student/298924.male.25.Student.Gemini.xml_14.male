I realized last night that the reason I am so intent on writing regularly in this blog is that I miss writing for the Maroon Tiger....Writing articles for the paper took alot out of me, but the feeling of seeing my writing in print and knowing it was meaningful to someone somewhere meant alot to me....  I have been in the lab for 7 hours and I have decided that I know all that I am going to know about the Head and Neck as well as the deep muscles of the Back....Dr. Jackson hit us with some crazy stuff today....but foolishness or not, tomorrow I will have my A, pleaze believe it....  A few thoughts on the weekend football....how bout them 'Noles?....You talk about someone laughing their ass off....I was one happy dude....I just hope Carolina doesn't do that to the Jackets or we are gonna have a problem....that song from the Wizard of Oz comes to mind....Ding Dong the Witch is dead...yes indeed!....The Falcons won which is always good and Michael Vick scored his first touchdown, but the thing that has me feeling really good is the fact that Jamal Anderson is playing well....of course he put up a good showing against the Panthers last year and it was all down hill but we shall see....I am willing to give him ethe benefit of the doubt...Now to some random thoughts....The Dolphins, Jags, Packers, Broncos, Rams, Raiders (happy OJ?), and Eagles are all legit contenders....The Chargers and Bengals will surprise....the Ravens, Bucs, Vikings, and Titans will disappoint...all in all it should be a good season....  Crystal is gone again....she is an enigma....her blog is always interesting reading but she is never around that long....oh well....at least I discovered some good ones through her...
