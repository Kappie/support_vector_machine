Traditionally (in the sense of college time) right about now, I'd be looking forward to going home for break and hopefully "hooking up" as the kids say with someone.  This year, none of that anticipatory glow.  Makes me a little sad.  But also lets me know how much I've learned...women suck.  No seriously, I've become more selective, yet not any luckier.  For some reason, whether it be the tides of the moon, the chill in the air, I always seem to revert back to Siamese Dream around these times, and without fail, I found myself listening to it on record this evening while critiquing papers.  I guess I also listen to it cause it used to remind me of a girl.  Still does in a few ways.  But anyways, I love the album, miss the love I associated with ladies.  At the end of Nov. I used to get excited by Thanksgiving and the day after cause I didn't have to go to school and I could play video games.  Now I understand the corporate desires that lay behind that day of, or rather that a President fixed Thanksgiving to that Thur. to help generate consumer spending.  Whatever.  This year I'm using that day off to see Satan sing naked in Milwaukee.  I win.  At least for one day.
