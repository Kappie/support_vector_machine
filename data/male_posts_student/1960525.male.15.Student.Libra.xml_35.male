I was thinking it was going to not be as nearly cool as I thought it was going to be but, DAMN, was I wrong. I like the city! It's cool beans!!! I really   Blue Man... oh my god... so awesome... loved it... cant stop thinking about it! The spin painting they made was cool. Even more-so because i BOUGHT IT. Boo-yah! Just goes to show you that i CAN do something better than Jesse ~Shakes fist in air~. I can see why Jess   ...  Me... Nobody understood it though. Like when they're playing and then the band is supposed to come in, but they dont and they look confused. Nobody got that! I was very offended! Stoopid non-Blue Man fans...  Thats all for now!
