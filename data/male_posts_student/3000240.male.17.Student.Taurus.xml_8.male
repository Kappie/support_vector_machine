Otherwise enjoy the article:    Letter from a disgruntled human being to the state of everything     If I have to sit on hold for one more minute, I will, I swear, lose my mind.  It won't be pretty.  Not only will you not allow me to speak with your manager, you also will not satisfactorily rectify my situation, make good on your promise to me.  And it isn't because doing so would be terribly difficult, or even against policy; you simply won't, because you know you don't have to. Isn't that the wonderful thing about free will?  You don't have to do one iota more than you wish to, and yet there is nothing to prevent you from complaining about it for time untold.  You don't have to have an opinion about anything, or a foundation for the ones you do have, yet you are allowed to fault others for theirs.  You never have to do one kind act for another human being your entire life, yet you can request, nay, demand it, of others.  All of the laws and rituals we have in place to maintain order; in the end they really have very little to do with justice, don't they? So if I have to sit here at this insane gathering, and listen to one more of you prattle on about your back pain, your indigestion, and your headaches, while you are stuffing your faces with french fries, sitting in front of your computer and sucking back coffee and pop, I will, in fact, lose it altogether.  Another promising mind disappears into the chaos of evermore.  Another scream lost in the white noise of industry.  I must say, Everything, while I'm still capable of saying it: you've lost control of your state.  You've succumbed to what you are. I am writing you this letter to tell you I want my subscription cancelled immediately.  I no longer want to turn on my television to watch the news and see these pitiful levels of "corruption" in my government, in their government, in all of them.  I no longer want to read excuses from my favourite musicians for not putting out another album, nor do I want to watch people's freaky fans demand things from other people they were lucky to get to begin with.  I no longer want to hear these well-groomed masses reiterating over and over again just how successful they are, in the hopes they themselves will believe it.  I no longer want to see one nation even try to justify going to war with another in this day and age.  I don't want to see your dominion looking to another source of power rather than working for themselves.  I would also like my money back for the time I did subscribe to your organization.  However, I realize this will be next to impossible, for I've seen the way your people keep their books, and since they can barely differentiate between a fur coat, a tank, a taxpayer, and a nourishing meal, I don't expect they would be even capable of finding my file, much less gleaning any worthwhile information from it if they did. Furthermore, I would like an all-expenses paid one-way trip from The State of Everything to Somewhere Better, or, if that deems too expensive, Somewhere Else.  I am told in Somewhere Better, people don't destroy every single thing they touch.  I have heard they treat people with the reverence we give our possessions, that the people who have devoted their lives to leading them have done so because they are good and intelligent, and because they are capable of making their world a better place. Even in Somewhere Else, the laws are very clear on what is Granted, so clear in fact that nothing is ever taken for it.  Because they have been able to make this important distinction, the people there are no longer mired in the religious or secular teachings of the State of Everything, whose greatest of failed motives were to instill an appreciation for that very big difference and act accordingly.  The people there aren't paralyzed by our inability to think or act of our own accord without first placing someone or something clearly in the path of our progress, whom we can then blame and receive reparations from.  In Somewhere Else, people are smart.  Which is more than I can say for your customer service team.    Sincerely,  Disgruntled Human Being.   xBuBzx
