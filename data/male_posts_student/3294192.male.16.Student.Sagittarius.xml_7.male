I'm going to my dad's place, which means more skinned knees, if you catch my drift. If you crash my curb. I also have one metric  ass-load  of homework to do, so I'm going to have to put off my urge to stay up late gaming with the pops.  I'm a fucking cutie apparently.  My heart's been getting it's daily smack requirements recently, and that's a good thing. I worked with that Guy on some hot beatz today for a little while, and we produced something smooth and satisfying. Hopefully I can sqeeze some more work on it into my weekend agenda.  Filler filler filler filler filler filler filler!  Looky what I did!   urlLink     Fucking God. There is a new video game coming out soon. It's called  urlLink Onimusha 3 . In it, you control a feudal Japanese ninja/samurai named Samonosuke, and also 1950's French hitman named  urlLink Leon , as played by Jean Reno in the amazing French film 'The Proffesional'. If that wasn't enough, there is also a 40 inch long ceremonial samurai sword you can use as a controller for your PS2. Fucking God. Ninjas are awesome, 'The Professional' is awesome, and me running around my house swinging a toy sword screaming "I AM SAMONOSUKE!" is the awesomest. Watch out ming vase, watch out cat, here comes Jono. Fucking God.   Konichiwah Bitchess.
