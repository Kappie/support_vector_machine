I am now starting to feel guilty about not doing summer reading.  It's August now.  Time for guilt.  Time for procrastination.  Ah, procrastination, I embrace thee.  I don't feel motivated.  I'm supposed to leave for Winter Park tomorrow for the shoot.  Funny thing: I haven't given them any of the paperwork for several valid reasons:  my printer is broken ergo I cannot print said documents here at my house, I need to fax them and Rebecca never  gave  me the fax number, and Rebecca never called me back.  All signs add up to "linden is screwed."  So who knows if I'm going anywhere tomorrow.  If I do, I won't be back for a while.  I probably ought to pack.  I want food, but I'm too lazy to cook anything.  Lazy.  I want Indian food.  If you read this, come give me Indian food.  I would seriously love you FOREVER.  Love.  And all I ask in return is aloo mutter, samosas, naan, and chai.  Sooooo yummy.  Gah, I want food.
