Friday went to coffee as usual, with Louise, Brooke and Helen. Brooke had loads of hickies, which was tres funny, I also managed to buy Rach's present whilst in Croydon - we got Â£9s worth of poundland goodies. Then went to a party that evening, it was great, saw quite a few people there I knew, who I didn't expect to see there. So that was cool, and when I got home I returned to find Jon had bought Mario Golf. Sweet.  Then yesterday I had theory and clarinet lessons with a tiny hangover, but that didn't bother me much, I just sat and worked quietly. Then went off to Rach's party, lots of friendly faces there, and a drunk one to (agressive retard) heh, so that's the second party with someone pissing on furniture, but this time it was intentional. Got there about 7:30 and got home around 10:30 in the morning, so that's about 15 hours of partying.  I think I just about managed to get all the relevent information in there in that post, missed out detail and other interesting things happening to me (otherwise I'd have nothing to tell you in person =P) but that was about the rough outline, and lack of detail goes hand in hand with lack of energy, which I am severly lacking right now.   So onto a day of recovery, monitoring my body clock and Mario Golf.
