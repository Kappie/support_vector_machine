RAD Phase RAD Life Cycle  1)Requirements Planning 2)User Designs 3)Construction 4)Cutover  Rapid TimeBox  - Non extendible time limit place on the prototyping phases  ---------------------------------------------------------  Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM)  DSDM Extends RAD -Project mgt -Group dynamics and team building -Cost estimations  risk assessment -Change control and configuration mgt -Quality assurance  testing strategies  ---------------------------------------------------------  DSDM Framework  - define as structure and controls to be used in a RAD project but does not specify a development metholodology - maybe be used with either OO or structured metholodology  ---------------------------------------------------------  DSDM Life Cycle Phases  1)Feasiblity study 2)Business study 3)Function Model Iteration 4)Design  build Iteration 5)Implementation  ---------------------------------------------------------  DSDM Timeboxing  -an approach for fixing project resource allocation -limits the time available for refinement of requirements design, construction and implementation  3 Major Concern -must carry out any investigation needed to determine the direction that should be taken for that part of the project -must the develop and refine the specified deliverables -must consolidate their work prior to the final deadline     -
