Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a total mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe.  it's weird how the human mind works. i sujest to everyone out there that they should take at least one psychology class, they're really amusing, and maybe if we all do then someone can figure out why most americans are so screwed up (don't worry i think in my next 5 blogs i'm gonna be taking shots at americans, all because of you Ori, and yes i'm a very spiteful bastard) -Matt
