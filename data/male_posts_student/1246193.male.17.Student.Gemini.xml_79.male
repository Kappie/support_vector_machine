It has been roughly a year and three months since I started blogging, and a change felt right.  I won't forget those crazy old blogs...but I will hopefully create some new ones worth remembering. What the hell and I talking about? It's a gosh-darned blog not my life. Sorry, I was having a weird nostalgic minute. Somebody needs to get me help. Anyway, lots of changes going on, some for the better and some for the worse. But hey, that's life.   It seems to me that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure on the world.                   --John Steinbeck
