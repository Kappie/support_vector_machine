Randal: I don't watch movies.  Customer: Well, have you heard anything about either one of them?  Randal: I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.  Customer: You mean you've haven't heard anybody say anything about either one of these?  Randal: Nope.  Customer: [Turns around, then shows Randal the same movies] Well, what about these two?  Randal: Oh, they suck.  Customer: These are the same two movies! You weren't paying any attention!  Randal: No, I wasn't.  Customer: I don't think your manager would appreciate...  Randal: I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.  Customer: I beg your pardon?  Randal: Your ruse; your cunning attempt to trick me.  Customer: I was only pointing out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying!  Randal: And, I hope it feels good.  Customer: You hope WHAT feels good?  Randal: I hope it feels so good to be right. There's nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?  Customer: Well, this is the last time I rent here!  Randal: You'll be missed.  Customer: Screw you!  Randal: Hey! (chasing after her) You're not allowed to rent here anymore!   I love Kevin Smith.
