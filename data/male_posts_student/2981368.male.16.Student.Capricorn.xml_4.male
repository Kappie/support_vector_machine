Science...Bishop needs to learn something: there is no way I'm asking in a lesson. Not even if he set himself on fire and jumped out the window as part of a deal. And Jack should shut up 'cos he really isn't helping.   Oh, another good thing was that I managed to find Andy Craig at lunch. That kid rules. He plays badminton at a county level in an under-17 (ish) team (despite only being in yr 7). And his form tutor is cool.  Woot.
