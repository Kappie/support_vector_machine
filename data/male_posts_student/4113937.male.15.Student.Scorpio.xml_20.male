I'm getting tired of the school day, just hope that i can be a normal person that can go school as i wanted and don't want to attend as i wanted.    After school, got a math directly after school and than after that company ivan to see contact len.  Wanted to get one but my parent don't allow, so what can i do, be a good boy and listen to them.    After that, i told a lie to my family that i going to school for some function but i went for huiling birthday dinner, haha.. Went to JP seoul garden and eat like hell.  Quite Full, still owe her money. haha.. okay.. shall end here, as i'm not going to school tomorrow.. see ya! maybe the 2nd part of the day? might be? and it confirmed now! haha..
