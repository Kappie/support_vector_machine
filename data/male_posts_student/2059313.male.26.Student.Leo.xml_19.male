No "getting readjusted" to them or anything. You can pretty much just pick up where you left off... and you can act as completely stupid or as completely sane as you want.  That's how it is with my "family" from Jenny Wiley Theatre.  For instance, Brad (my boss) and I got into it several times this past summer when I worked there, but I saw him tonight, and after a few minutes, it never even occured to me that I had been upset with him at all.  I feel for the most part, I have made correct guesses as to who I invest myself into.  This is a group of people that I know I'll get a good return from.  We're not real deep, but that's cool.  I've got other friends to fulfill that need or desire.  It's just a lot of fun, with a dose or two of deepness.
