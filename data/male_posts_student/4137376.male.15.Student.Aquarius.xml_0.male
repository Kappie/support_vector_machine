It was ok work just hauling junk from a truck then off the truck into the house. I did meet a new freshman that's going to my high school. I had met him before back in the day when I was little. Him, this other kid, and I were all on a team in a bowling league. I didn't recognize him but when he mentioned it I did. Oh well he should have fun as a freshman at my high shcool except maybe on Welcome week. LOL I wont go in on the details.  Now I get to sit around all day being bored. That's always fun. I think my purpose in life is to be bored. I can't wait for school I miss all my friends.  I'm off to be bored so stop reading because it will end soon. I'm serious! Go! Leave! Come back tomorrow when I post something else. Didn't I tell you to leave so stop reading already. This will go on forever if you don't stop reading. Wow I am bored.
