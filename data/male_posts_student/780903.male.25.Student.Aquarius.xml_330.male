For this purpose, we will make available the south end of the Harkness dining room. We will have coffee and snacks (donuts, cookies) available during the day, free of charge, at times when meals are not being served."  Free cookies?  Let the war begin?  I can't possibly be the only person who thinks this is a little odd.
