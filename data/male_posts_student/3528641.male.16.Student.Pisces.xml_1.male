Let me see here...today I woke up and watched "Judging Amy" on ch.23.  I did some more boring stuff and then I called this girl that I am talking to. She's real cool. I met her at Banana Joes (club opened for teens on teen night) on Sunday and called her on Monday at like 11 somethin. We talked till about 2 o'clock in the morning. We had a lot to talk about. Her personality is on point and she has her head on her shoulders. Dang, it's nice to find somebody like that. But neway, I called her today and she had lost her voice. We talked then she said she would call me back cuz her godmother was on the other line. Havent heard from her yet but hopefullly i will. Oh, let me tell you the story about my club experience at BJ's! Okay so me and that girl (I'll call her...Nicole); so me and Nicole are dancin and we had been dancin for the longest time, it was goin on 30min. So we're dancin and this dude comes up beside me and puts his hand on her back WHILE WE'RE DANCIN! so you know, i thought he was just tryin to get by so i didnt say nething, but why is his hand still there 45 seconds later. So i tried to kinda hint to him to move his hand so i put my elbow up to move his hand. Nicole was lettin me know she didnt wanna dance with him cuz she was grabbin on to my arms and stuff. So okay after i did the elbow thing, HIS HAND IS STILL THERE so i was like "eh man, we aint gone be finished no time soon" (bad grammar-i know). He asked me if that was my girl and I told him yeah, which was a lie but that was the only way i would get him to leave us alone. So we were dancin and dancin and everybody was crowded around us. Dudes kept askin if that was my girl and I kept tellin them yeah. We danced for a straight HOUR.We sweated so much. We were drippin in sweat. I cant wait till the next time i go. It'll have to wait 3 more weeks cuz I'm goin to some camps, Carolina Journalism Institue and I'm going to a camp at Clemson for the SATs. The Clemson camp is for 2wks but we get to chill out and have fun over the weekend so I'll be alright. But um..I have to go pee and I've already written so much so I will just write again tomorrow.  Keep the peace, LaRon
