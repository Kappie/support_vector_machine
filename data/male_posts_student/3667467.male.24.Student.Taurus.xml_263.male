Not that I wanted to work. I didn't work that hard when I got there. Also, Joe (from "Joe's Blog") told me to write about what a jerk he is on my blog, so here it is. Man, that Joe, what a jerk! My apartment smells like bean soup. I'm a bit constipated. My alarm clock is set to play Iggy Pop and The Stooges' "Search and Destroy" tomorrow morning. Before I go to work at noon, I have to fill my car with gas. You're this close to reading Adult Swim News here. (If you get that one, E-mail me. We'll hang out.)
