IT'S FREE  AND IT'S REQUIRED .  The bolding is me, this phrase reeks with subtle Orwellian-ism.  I know Todd has mentioned this in regard to taxes, but I really think the spreading of personal information has become so "innocent" now that nobody would even blink at registering now, Really, read that statement and think about it...
