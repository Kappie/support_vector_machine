I have a locker next to Kyle.. It's going to be weird without any upper-classmen here.. I'm gonna miss some of the seniors... But hey, they're livin the life now...   Anyway,  Rick, are you back from Florida yet? Wish you would have come to orientation.  Oh well. I'm done wasting time now.  Goodbye.
