WARNING I TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN"T SEEN IT STOP READING AND GO TO MY POST BELOW WHICH IS A GOOD POST. Ok, I didn't think there was a good climax. It was exciting and all that, but just as The Two Towers wasn't as "cool and new" this one seemed very similar to the first. and w/ the action climax being anti-climatic (Doc-Ock realizing he needed to stop) and the romantic climax weak - they should have tried to combine the two. My rating would be a **1/2 stars out of ****. Some parts were very enjoyable, though. Like I said earlier, it is very much like "Two Towers" in that it is the middle of a "trilogy," this movie just seemed like 2 hours with just the story carrying on leading to the next movie.
