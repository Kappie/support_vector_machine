Well the past two months have been a state of pure bliss for me. Schools ended, yet my sister still has to go to school and my mum works. The result; I end up being at home, alone. And I can watch as many day time chat shows, as I want. Or as much time on the computer without annoying little voices pestering me for help.  like I say, bliss. And after having to drag myself out of bed at 1:00 in the afternoon to go watch her embarrassingly crap sports day I figured I could spend today recuperating. But no.   thanks to yesterday she manages to catch some generic cold, or flu or whatever. So she stays at home. With me. Am I happy? Hell no. Not after listening to her winging and whining at me for the entire day. And thanks to her overhearing a certain talk with my mom, managed to blackmail me into waiting on her hand and foot....Bitch!  I might not hope its contagious...But I sure as hell hope its fatal...
