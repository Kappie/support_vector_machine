Anyway, as for the updates, I have done a lot to this site over the past few days.  Here's the low-down:   Added new polls.   Added ability to view results of polls without voting.   Added new links.   Added easy access to Atom Feed.   Added new RSS 2.0 Feed from FeedBurner (thanks!).   Added Google search of site and web.   Added a Thanks section.   Added the Site Meter service.  There's one problem that I'm having, though, with the link to Jinx Hackwear in the Links section.  It's hard for me to make the image show up on the page.  Does anyone else have this problem?  I mean, do you see the image for Jinx in the Links section or not?  Leave a comment, if you feel like being nice to me.  If this doesn't get fixed in a day or so, I'll just replace the image with a text link.  I plan to keep on updating and stuff, just as every good little boy and girl should.  It's the proper thing to do, you know?  Keep checking back to see what wondrous and astounding things I do to this site, and, of course, to read this amazing content I type up for all to see.  You wouldn't believe how many hours I've spent working on this.  And, in addition to you benefitting from my hours of work, I have also gained quite a bit of knowledge about CSS and other parts of the web design involved with this blog.  I'm very happy about this, and you should be too.  It's a shame no one reads this.
