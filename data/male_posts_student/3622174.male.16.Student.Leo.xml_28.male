I've noticed this one to be much better looking and faster than most of the other file share programs, such as Kazaa or iMesh.    BearShare may not have the best name, but, it serves its purpose...its a p2p network so you can share files with other users.  It's much faster than the other ones.  The interface for BearShare is the cleanest interface for a file sharing program.  It integrates perfectly with Windows XP, and it doesn't freeze at all!  (At least, not yet it hasn't).  Overall, I'd say this is the best file sharing program.  It runs on Gnutella, it's fast, and it's the best one yet.  Go download it.    Pros  +Fast +Nice Interface +Easier to download things   Cons  -Stupid Name    Score  Fun Factor: 95%-A Graphics/Layout: 100%-A Speed: 98%-A Customization/Controls: 95%-A Final:  97%-A GOLD  ------------------------- Daily Wrap Up- July 8, 2004  Today we looked at some new things, and gave out two platinums.    We looked at "In God We Trust" on Atom Films Hi-Def for the video of the day.  It's hilarious, original storyline, and great production values.  This received a 100% Platinum.  Today's tip was finding the best guestbook to use for your blog.  I recommend iGuest over anything else, but we also took a look at HTML Gear, and Ultraguest.    Today's Site was Rotten Tomatoes, which received a 100% Platinum.  This is the place to go to find the best movie reviews, game reviews, and more.  They have the tomatometer which tells you if a movie or game is fresh or rotten, depending on its archived score.    And finally, today's download was BearShare.  This is the best file sharing program out there, its fast, and it's easy to use.  That's it for Digital Lust tonight.  Be sure to check out Blog of Bagel for my nightly escapade, with Late Night Bloggin', and other things.  See you tomorrow here on Digital Lust.
