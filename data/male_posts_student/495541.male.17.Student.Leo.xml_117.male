I'm pissed at hearing stuff at halftime and then not being able to do something for the rest of the game.  No wait, I was supposed to score 10 points and 10 rebs in the actual 10 seconds I played in the second half.  I'm not too excited about it, can you tell?  Whenever we lose, I never seem to think about it more than a few times.  I put it behind me quickly.  I couldn't tell you the last 3 teams we played.  I want to do better, I want to develop as a player.  I'm just sick of all the dumb, stupid and weird stuff.  Oh well.
