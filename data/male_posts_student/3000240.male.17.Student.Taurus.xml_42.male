I heard on one of the fan sites that we got "caught out" and I think this is true in many senses. 3-1 isn't the worst result in the world, but God dammit, we have play out of our Caracas' to win it in the second leg. It can be done, it's possible most certainly, and still we are only 90 minutes away from a date in Germany. I pray to God that we get there, and lets have hope instead of cliche pessimism. xBuBzx
