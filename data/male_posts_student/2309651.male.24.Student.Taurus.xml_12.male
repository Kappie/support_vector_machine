Traffic was snarled from downtown to the interchange at 695.  All for a police funeral.  Now, I am for honoring fallen police officers as much as the next person, but at what cost?  There must have been tens of thousands affected by the funeral procession of one man.  The entire JFX was shut down as well as the northside of the Beltway and Harrisburg Expressway to Padonia Road.  I am not saying that this man did not deserve some sort of police honor, but not at this cost.  I waited in traffic for about an hour to run simple errands, but think of the truck driver who had to make a delivery or of the business man late for an important meeting.  It just isn't worth it.  Not to mention it seemed like every police officer in the state was in a 2 mile radius of each other.  I think honoring the dead has its limitations.
