The drama! The confusion! The changes :D! Blogspot updated it's controlstoday so I can use special effects in my blog. New header time!          .Scene         NYC FLgsjdngdsfd    If you can read this you have way too much time on your hands.            .Scene (End Intermission)       Maybe next I'll do something else original, like spell my screenname mRuNsEnSiTiVe04 instead of all lowercase letters.    Maybe I'll write like this so it's like in code. In fact, from now on I'm going to start hiding messages like this. So highlight sometimes, and you might find some surprises!  Try highlighting that black space.    Maybe I should talk about my day ;/. I mentioned the part about me being sick. I think Mike's mad at me because I told him I didn't feel well yesterday, and I don't think he believed me :(. I suck. Then, my parents wanted to go to this really expensive restaurant (They had a giftcard for it), but there was traffic so we went to Outback instead (Still expensive). We had some recovering alcoholic lady as our waitress.  Then I got home and called Bobby. Ehh, for the rest of the night I think I'm going to spite myself and not call Bobby back. Once again he acts as though I don't exist. We were on the phone, and Brittney wasn't answering. So he called her again. I hate how he acts like him talking to me is a gift to me. No problem. Then again. Then again. Like I wasn't there; like he had nobody to fucking talk to. Not his best friends =/. Whatever.    Pissed off... again.    .Credits  Mike - Good friend in Illinois. I'm going to six flags with Mike and Jason this Saturday.  Bobby- Best friend in the world; pissing me off lately.  Brittney- One of my best friends.   .Music  Blink-182 -Violence
