Back in my youth, when half-terms and holidays were a time for getting drunk, staying up late and blogging about the most meaningless of things. And angsting because Lee from Blue is better looking than you are. Okay, nothing's actually changed in that time, and I still hate Lee from Blue.  This is a place where I will post things that happen in my life, and some things that don't.  Actually, I've just realised that that last sentence makes no sense. I feel strange tonight, like I'm drunk a bit. But I haven't had any alcohol since last night, and today have drunk eight cans of coke and two mugs of coffee. I'm gonna level with you: I think it was the coke.
