The term was twisted to mean the manners which were expected of nobility.  Technically, a gentleman is someone of high birth not good manners so no mattter how well-mannered I am, I can never be a gentleman.  A gentleman can actually be one of the worst mannered people ever.  Such is true with "sportsmanship" also.  Sportmanship is not a list of noble qualities in an athlete but rather the way athletes act.  The way athletes act is going downhill.  i.e. Intramurals.  Shoethrowing, water bottle throwing/smashing, throwing/kicking the ball across the field would all be considered poor qualities in a losing sportsman or even a sportsman who may be winning but does not agree with a referee's call.  The "must win" attitude can be frustrating too.  I paid $25 to play in every game, not to be able to say "My team won every game".  Also, if you have the minumum amount of required players, then you should not be able to draft from other teams for an extra player.  Especially when someone from your team is the one who spends the majority of the time sitting out and that person from the other team plays in your game and then their own teams.  Retarded.
