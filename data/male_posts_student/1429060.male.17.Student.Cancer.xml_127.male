I have chosen, to escape chores as well as to feel accomplished, to use my time at the Trezevant Manor Retirement Community (where, incidentally, my father is one of the top directors. But that has nothing to do with this). The good thing about Trezevant is that all the residents love anyone young and take instantly to them (many times). The staff is actually really happy with some new faces too. The bad thing is that you can't always understand what the residents are saying.  Tanya and Siberia, two of the staff members, are cool and absolutely hysterical. I think they appreciate my help. Distracting the residents and whatnot. We actually went to Cracker Barrel today and had much fun at our own table.  I woke up Miles from her nap after volunteering. I am such an ass. Well, I'll make it up to her. With ice cream. Ice cream always makes everything better.  Not much else is happening. Amber still needs to come back to Memphis. Her cousin Amanda should come too. We will flee this little circle of inferno to somewhere grander, like Nashville. Hot tub party in the Ritz, ladies and gentlemen.
