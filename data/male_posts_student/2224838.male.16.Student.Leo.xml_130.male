Last night's game between the Philadelphia Flyers and Toronto Maple Leafs concluded in some of the most amazing overtime play that I have ever seen. Although it was only a little over seven minutes long, it was so fast-paced that it didn't matter.  Only seconds before the winning goal was scored, Sami Kapenen of the Flyers was slammed into the boards so hard that it made me forget my own name. The replay of the hit showed just how much he had to struggle to get onto his feet and make it into his team's box. Forty seconds later, the game was over when Jeremy Roenick drove a wicked slapshot straight into the net.   The Flyers' win over the Maple Leafs, and the Sharks' win over the Avalanche last night conclude this round. The next round is the Eastern Conference final between the Flyers and Lightning, and the Western Conference final between the Sharks and Flames. You are guaranteed some good hockey if you just watch.  Check  urlLink ESPN.com  for more information on the playoffs. As my brother says though, you'll never find hockey on the front page.
