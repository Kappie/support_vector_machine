      It's a little after 9 in the AM, and I got home from work just a short while ago.  I'm pulling midnite shifts all this month.  I've been up for something like 26 hours.  Yesterday I worked until 4PM and then had to be back at midnite.  Being that I'm not used to being up all night and sleeping during the day, I couldn't sleep yesterday afternoon.  I ended up watching Futurama all evening.  Now I'm exhausted, but I don't want to sleep, it's a nice day out and I feel like I should be up.  I'm sure I'll get used to being up all night.  This is only for a month.  Plus the shift differential is nice.  But it's playing tricks on my body.  I'm tired, yet I want to stay awake.  And I didn't eat dinner until after midnite, so it's obviously got my digestion out of whack, as I now have a slight case of the sqirting ass-gremlins.  It's obviously messing with my judgement too, as evidenced by what I just posted.  Good to see Glenn is poting on here, what an effort.  I think I should get to bed now befoe I starrt makeng tieping mifstakes.
