I need to be careful though - I suffered severe withdrawal symptoms after Wimbledon, and the only thing that kept me going was the thought of the tennis in the Olympics. I have no idea why - I know fuck all about tennis, can't remember the last time I played it, and when I did, I'm sure I was awful - but whenever it comes on TV I become obsessed and can't bear to stop watching for one minute in case I miss a crucial point. I  hate  Tim Henman though, and I always end up pissed off when they invariably show decades of footage of him and then spend 10 seconds talking about the other matches.  I also attempted to carry on writing my novel. Yeah, I still haven't done any coursework, but I always find time to try and write this dreadful novel. I won't discuss the plot etc. on here (someone may steal my fantastic ideas (!) ) but rest assured you will never be reading it, nor would you ever want to.  I haven't developed any particularly good writing technique as yet though - I write pages and pages of stuff off the top of my head, read it all back, decide it's all shit, try and think everything through this time, write one paragraph in a few hours, then stop. At this rate, I'll be writing the damn thing on my deathbed.  I have similar problems writing this blog, although I'm pretty sure nobody's reading it anymore (am I right?), so  I don't worry too much.  Daniel
