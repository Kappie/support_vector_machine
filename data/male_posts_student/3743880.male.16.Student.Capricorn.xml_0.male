No, not like in high fidelity...but by telling people they could never understand a type of music and things like that.   This started out way back when I was in something like 6th grade. I had finally gotten a CD player, and one of the first CD's I bought was blink 182. It was like..."Woah," because I had only listened to bubblegum stuff on a pop station before that. I eventually worked my way into the rock scene with other numerous CD's. All my friends, and especially this girl liz, loved Blink. We went to their concert with green day, bought all their cd's, etc..etc... We would argue about songs, and download all their music videos and stuff. It was cool back then.   Present day (2004), I guess the cool thing is to not like Blink 182? People think it makes them look better if they are above Blink 182. They think that if you can listen to pink floyd and DMB, then you can't listen to Blink 182. I don't know about them, but I can claim to have done that a lot. So what if you think it's cool not to listen to them? The plain fact is that their music sounds good so I'm going to listen to it. That goes for everything.  Then comes the other people who claim that no one can be punk except for them. There is this one girl by the name of emily slagel. She claims that she listened to green day as a little kid, and that no one else could have. This makes her   punk  . I didn't buy their CD as a kid, but my dad did, and I listened to it. Does that count? I have news for Emily though. She must like the image of being punk rather than being punk, because I distinctly remember her loving the song, "This I promise you." by Nysnc  A couple more things and I'm done. It's ok to like classical music...admit it.....you like it. I'm not talking about mozart and bach. I'm not to fond of them either. What I'm talking about is movie themes. Who doesn't whistle the star wars theme song? I love all 3 LOTR soundtracks, and the spider-man theme is always growing on me. The passion soundtrack is amazing, and so is the score for Big Fish. If you don't like that kind of stuff fine, but if other people do, respect them for it. Well, unless they like really bad EMO and try to wear buddy holly glasses...in that case make fun of them. Or if they are a white kid wearing their hat slightly sideways and says words like "Fool" or "Owned," or "You got served" In that case beat the shit of them.  My philosophy is listen to what you like. It's simple and works well. (Too bad radio stations can't see that, instead of promoting shitty artists) Give me my own radio station and I'd have twice as many listeners as the Top one in pittsburgh, garunteed.
