When sometime deep in the night I could even be done?  Work me hard, 'til I die Though I have no life there is nothing that I cannot buy I've been waiting forever for this This is the firm  When the answer to all my dreams Is just one Lexis search away I will be here till the day turns to night turns to day.  Work me hard, 'til I'm dead But at least my parents can say that I'm striving ahead Lose my friends, lose my mind But my loans are paid and there's no take-out food I can't find I've been waiting forever for this This is the firm  This is the firm where we spend our best years and we end up a shell of ourselves This is the firm where the work I'll do sends me to hell  Work me hard, kill my soul Make me realize that giant paychecks can make me feel whole Heart grows cold, mind grows numb But the choice is one that is safe and will not be called dumb I've been waiting forever for this This is the firm
