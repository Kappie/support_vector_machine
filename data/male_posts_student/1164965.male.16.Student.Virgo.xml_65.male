I will already have five AP classes next year, and if the PE department won't be like a bigot like they usually do, I could manage my sixth period a leadership class. But if they become a usual royal pain in the ass, (Yeah they think PE is so much harder and more important than AP Literature or AP Physics) then I will have to resort to my last resort, and that is, to take all SIX AP classes.  But anyways, a new book just came out on Bush's secret plan to invade Iraq right when the invasion of Afghanistan started. The book is called "Plan of Attack" by Bob Woodward.  Peace out, and let's all have a moment of silence for all the innocent soldiers killed in Iraq.  Thomas Chen
