He tells me that he knows what he's fighting for, and that his training prepared him for this day.  I told him that I was as anti-war as anyone could be...not just this war, but any war, even if Iraq bombed the hell out of us, I'd want a diplomatic solution (that they haven't, and that there is no connection to terror and Iraq, except if we terrorize Iraq, we will be terrorized by al Qaeda zealots).  And he is cool with that.    This is anecdotal evidence, mind you, but I have a big problem when people say that once our boys head off to war, I need to support them.  True, I don't want to see American soldiers die.  But I don't want to see Iraqis die either.  And I don't see how that makes me anti-American.  I sure as hell am anti-American foreign policy, as I have been for ages...I first spoke out about it in 1996 back at the  Rogers Hometown News , as a acne-stricken 16 year old realizing that something was wrong with the way we treated others around the world, but not knowing what.  Anyway, here's a statement that should get me on a government list somewhere:  just because they are American soldiers doesn't mean I should value them more so than other peoples of the world.    Here's a quote from today's  urlLink Daily Texan  from a Republican protester of the Bill Clinton speech:  "I wouldn't give a piss about 100 of their people over ours. I'm concerned about Americans and American security."   So when a mother comes up to me on the street, knowing that I am anti-war, and says, "My son is in Saudi Arabia, gun in hand, ready to fight for your freedom, and you are not in the least grateful," I will look back at her and say, "I am grateful.  But I don't like the orders they are forced to carry out.  We think of ourselves as the greatest nation in the history of the world.  Can't we solve a dispute with a third-world country whose army is weak, who is saddled by strenuous sanctions, and whose defense system is already being destroyed by the UN through a means other than killing?  I don't want your son to die.  I don't want anyone to die."    So Will, best of luck to you.  Go do your duty.  But I'm not behind you on this one.  You've got to do your job.  But admiration will only come when the Commander-in-Chief changes the orders and thinks about humans rather than capital and elections.
