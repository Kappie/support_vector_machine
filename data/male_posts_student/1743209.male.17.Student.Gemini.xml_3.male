I actually bothered to do some of my homework set for over the holidays today, I am spacing it out so I don't get to bored with doing it all in one go; after all, holidays are for resting. Talking of which; today is my last of two consectutive Saturdays off work, so next Saturday, I am back to my normal 9-6pm shift at Sainsbury's!  Also today, me and my brother (I haven't mentioned him yet have I? He's 14) went to Mike and Josh's house (Mike's my mate) but only Josh was in (he's my brother's mate). So anyway, Josh is a wicked guitarist (although he mainly plays bass, which my brother does too.) so we all had a bit of a jam this afternoon.  That's about it for today, I'll post another blog tommorow!  P.S. I doubt it will stay nice weather for long - The forecast is another large thunderstorm even WORSE (If that is posibble??!!) than the previous one within 48hrs.
