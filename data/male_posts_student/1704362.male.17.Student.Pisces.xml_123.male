Anyone not interested should submit to my will or be crushed by my merciless marauders of evil. There is no escape. Give us your precious bodily fluids.    Blood collected in said blood drive has no guarantee of not being used in Satanic rituals, consumed, or sold as a cheap alternative to oil-based paint    Despite all that, I am being serious. It's just an hour or two out of a summer day. Cleanse the poisons of high school from your circulation. And you get cookies.
