Me, and Svana, think its a great idea and nobody should leave an oportunity like this unnoticied. I personally would leave in a heart beat.  He will be leaving Norway on Sunday to Nanching which is on the south-east side of the country but not that close to sea.  Offcourse I offered Veigar to post some news of his travels on this great page but we have to see how well plugged he is.  I also heard from Edgar who had his first day of the second semester in Esade but school began yesterday, on monday, he told me that it was rather lonely now that we the great people have gone.  It wont be longer at this time.  Cheers to Veigar, Ãšlli
