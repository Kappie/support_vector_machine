Then jizzy went out fo dinna and me and matt were jus stuck here, wit no ride, no money to go to rusty's pizza. So, i realized that i had a karaoke machine mic thingy at my crib i was like "matt...lets bust". And then jizzy came ova in a lil while, and it was jus us guyz bustin up that karaoke mic, we probly did this for the 4 hourz. Im tellin, singin can get addictive, hhhanywayz, i have to go to villanova tomorrow to get my video done to send to all of the colleges, so can have a good ol time in college, playin vball and tryin new things and probly doin thingz that i shouldnt b doin...haha..yup, cant wait til that happenz...payce.
