The amazing thing was that i didin't eat in recess time... hehehe.. see??? how lazy i am until i have no appetite to eat. Prelim is just this coming friday and i haven't really do an important thing, which is to revise! ohhhwwwww man! i can't imagine what will happen to me... hope miracles come again!    In da evening around 8pm +++ i went out to have dinner with my bro! drian! hehe.. he seemed to be quite moody as that bastard came and joined us.. his name is *e*** (tooottttt e toooootttt) hehe... and my bro seemed to me recalling his past. his bad mamories with that bitch that he used to like! what a sad thing to remember! it's ok.. i will always be there for u bro! cheer up ok? hehe. and hopefully by this thursday. u can start a new chapter with ya lovely ex-gf. i will pray for ya success! u really rox my day today.. u told me a love story.. it's between u and her.. it's kinda cool! u are such a faithful dude! keep it up.. try to make "the notebook 2" (but leave the sex part behind ok? huahuahuahua) hehe.. all da best! hehe.. and for me.. i will wait..... till the one show up! ;)
