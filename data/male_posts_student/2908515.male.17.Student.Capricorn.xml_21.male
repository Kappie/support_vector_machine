So I should start now and get a good e-mail address before they all are taken up.  It is at  urlLink This.Car.Up@gmail.com .    Forensics is fun.  I thought I had something really pressing to say here.  I like hanging out with the little posse that formed.  This one guy is really nice looking.  He does a really good George Bush impression.  I have definately taken a liking to him.    Today at lunch, we discussed gay marriage.  His friend, Tom, had the same views as I did.  Basically I am against gay marriage because I find that contradictary.  Marriage is a religious ceremoney and I don't see how the state can have the power to either ban or allow gay marriages.  It is up the the church to decide whether or not they will allow marriage.  I think the state should only be able to allow civil unions.  Civil unions between man-man, woman-woman, or man-woman.  It doesn't matter because its not marriage.  Marriage is left to the religion.  Which is where it belongs.  Tomorrow is the last day of forensics.  Its also violin lesson day.  Which I am dreading since I have not practiced.  I've been so busy.    Sigh.  In a good way.
