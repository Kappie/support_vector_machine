Hmmmeppff... After 6 days work, it's really enjoyable to chill out with frens..heheh...  Reading back those testimonials from my frens n students in friendster really make me laugh...hhahha... erm... i think i shouldn't have put on my ear-rings on my 2nd n 3rd ear-pierced... this is not good if any students spotted it... hehehe.... actually, i dun feel like i m soft spoken, good or watever they said about me... but one thing for sure is i m a moody person. U can see me really cheerful in a moment and down like hell a min after that... When i moody, i just shut myself up... dun feel like talking to anyone else and this really tensed up frens around me... i am silent n din talk much when meeting up with new friends, so my 1st impression to that person,is really unfriendly, not sporting at all...ehhehe.. but to those who noes me....heheh....i can be really talkative, hyperactive (if too much caffiene), spoilt brat (coz i likes to manja ppl...muahhahah), i m always in the state of blur... hahaha... cant take it lei.... well this is real me...!
