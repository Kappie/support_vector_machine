Hell even Katherine seemed quite funky for the most part, which I can't say is the norm for her from what I've known, and I'd love to get to know both of the better, but its just the way, that not only them, but myself come across towards each other which is the possible reason for the feeling of nausea we all experience when we encounter the joint presence of each other. I'm sure they're lovely and all, but anyway . . .  God how I was scared at 2 am this morning when I thought it was the philosophy exam at 9, and to my utter relief, and utter adoration of Emaan from here on in - it was only the 3rd attempt to get a GCSE in mathematics and nothing of a more sinister persuasion.  I'm getting quite girlishly excited about seeing Jo on Saturday now, (with mentions from my friends of bout's of giggling and skipping amongst other things lol) and I am NOT going to ruing the 1st opportunity with a girl in 2 years out of esteem naivete. I like her. She's so funky, and anyone who talks to her would utter the same warm friendly gestures as I would about her. Anyway - I'm fairly tired now, so I must be of. Ciao. xBuBzx
