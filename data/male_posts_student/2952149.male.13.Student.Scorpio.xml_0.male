The one good thing that happened today is I got tickets to the Yellowcard concert with Stacey. It's not that I expected her to agree with what I said in my blog but I am just frustrated and I know it isn't her fault and I am not mad at her but I wish she knew how I felt. I think I love her and I am not just saying that.
