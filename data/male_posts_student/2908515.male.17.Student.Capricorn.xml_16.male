I think this summer is going to be one of the better summers so far.  Other than that, um...Matt's being an asshole.  I think I'm going to not talk to him for the weekend.  Then I'll see if he's still an asshole.  I think it would be cool if he came begging for me to talk to him since he usually says I have interesting viewpoints on everything.  And that I'm an awesome guy.  He's an awesome guy too but its like talking to myself, I'm such an asshole.  And he is too.  Mood rings.  Yup, thats what we need.  Only manly ones.  That are cool.  Maybe we'll see Harry Potter, that looks like a cool movie.
