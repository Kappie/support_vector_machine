I've never in my life spent $25 for a CD/DVD set, but I have to say it was worth it! Other  urlLink live recordings  of Guster pale in comparison to this album. This album makes them look great!  I love the live versions of "Happier" and "Careful". Of course, that's not to say the rest of the album doesn't rock ('cause it does)! I have never doubted myself for being a Guster fan.   I also recommend watching "Dave Yonkman's Week with Guster". Very informative, if not funny.  I'll be sure to post a better review later.  For anyone who's interested, Dashboard Confessional has made their new song   urlLink "Vindicted"  available for free on their website,  urlLink DashboardConfessional.com . This is the very one that is featured on the Spider-man 2 soundtrack. No strings attatched! Serious!  Word.
