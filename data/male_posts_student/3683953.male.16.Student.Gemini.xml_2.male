Since I just started this thing, I guess I'll talk about what has happened since last Thursaday (my birthday). So my birthday was really boring, it was basically just like any other day. I didn't get any presents (as usual). Let's see, I think the last time I got a present on my birthday was when I was 6. I mean, I guess I shouldn't be complaining since I haven't got one in the past 10 yrs, but it'd just be nice to get something. Anyway, I'm used to it, so it really doesn't matter.   Friday was better. I got to talk to Joey and Corey (both of which I really enjoy talking to). Since it was my birthday the day before, Joey decided that he'd send me a picture or two so then I'd know what he'd look like. All I've got to say is that he is very very very cute. So that was pretty good. Then later on at night, I talked to Corey, whom I was really glad to talk to because I hadn't talked to him in about a month. It was good to hear that at least one person in his family (his brother) was accepting of who he was. I'm really happy for him. Then of course, we talked about shopping (dunno, how we got to it, but we got to it), and clothes and shoes and designers and stuff. It was really fun, and then funny when he started thing of designers from A to Z.   Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were all very dull. Just did a whole bunch of cleaning the house and washing the cars (ugh, who enjoys that? I sure don't. Plus, I hate dust and dirt, I can't breathe correctly after I clean). So ya, it was boring and passed by very sloooooooooooooooooow.   Then yesterday or today or whatever it is (Tuesday) was....ummm....I guess kind of blah. I spent most of it downloading music (mostly music frm the 70s, 80s, and 90s). Then I don't know what happened, but as I started watching this soap opera that I always watch, all these feelings that I   STILL   have for this one guy that I'm love with just all of a sudden came rushing back. I mean I told him that I loved him and well I didn't get the response that I wanted, so I'm guessing you can tell what happened. It felt like a river breaking down a dam. I don't know, it was just very heart wrenching and didn't feel good at all. That's what happened today, except I wasn;t even talking to him at the time so I don't know why it happened. I just wanted to runaway and be   ALONE  , but I guess I shouldnt do that since it doesn't solve anything. And as of right now, i still feel the same. I'm back to my state of confusion and of feeling lost. So basically, all I've been listening to today is Jumper - Third Eye Blind, Unwell - Matchbox Twenty, Closing Time - Matchbox Twenty, 100 Years - Five for fighting, Come On - Ben Jelen, Screming Infidelities - Dashboard Confessional, Hands Down - Dashboard Confessional, Let Him Know - Bryan Adams, Me Voila! (Here I Am) - Bryan Adams, and Losing My Religion - R.E.M. But mostly I kept it to Jumper, Let Him Know, and Me Voila!   JUMPER - THIRD EYE BLIND  I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, You could cut ties with all the lie that you've been living in, And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand, I would understand  The angry boy, a bit too insane, Icing over a secret pain, you know you don't belong, You're the first to fight, you're way too loud, You're the flash of light, on a burial shroud, Well everyone I know has got a reason, to say, put the past away,  I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in, And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand, I would understand  Well he's on the table, and he's gone to code, And I do not think anyone knows, what they are doing here, And your friends have left, you've been dismissed, I never thought it would come to this, And I, I want you to know, Everyone's got to face down the demons, Maybe today, we can put the past away,   I wish you could step back from that ledge my friend, You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in, And if you do not want to see me again, I would understand, I would understand  Can you put the past away? I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend, I would understand...   LET HIM KNOW - BRYAN ADAMS  Another day goes by and still you wonder what happened You'd give the world for one more try But you're too shy to ask him You don't wanna ask him now I know your heart will pull you through If he means that much to you - you gotta let him know  Let him know that you love him You gotta let him know  What can I say it's up to you You gotta make up your own mind Well it's your life it's up to you  Cause you didn't believe me You still don't believe me Now you're gonna see it's all comin' true That's why I'm leavin' it up to you Yeah you gotta let him know  The news is out I guess you heard I shouldn't breathe a single word  The bottom line is nothing's gonna stop you now You gotta let him know....  I don't know if this song has any relevance but I've been singing it all day  ME VOILA! (HERE I AM) - BRYAN ADAMS  Eh eh eh Je suis là... me voilà... Jamais je ne pourrais vivre sans toi. Me voilà.., et à tes côtés. Ce soir, j'ai le droit de rêver.  Un nouveau monde, une nouvelle vie, Nos deux coeurs battent au rythme de la prairie.
