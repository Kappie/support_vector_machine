LoL! then we went home, and nicole called me, and she came over my house @ like 9:45...wound up talking all night instead of watching a movie, and she left @ like 2 in the morning LoL! we lit candles and talked for HOURS! (no, its not what you're thinking--so stop thinking it!) then, tim and i went to bed, and my friend who might be pregnant calls me and wakes me up @ like 9...so, im tired AND mad LoL but at least she is NOT pregnant! PTL!!! so then, i get on the comp (AIM), and nicole is on, and asks if tim and i want to go to San Francisco with her and Jenny Broker to shop and have lunch. so, as if my mom would say YES to that, i just told her i was going to the beach, and it was all good LoL! we were in this one store, and all the music was about SEX SEX SEX..and my mom was like: noah, what is that music?...and i was like: mom, they're having a dance competition at the beach LoL!!
