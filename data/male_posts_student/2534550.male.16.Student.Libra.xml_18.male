No other details yet, although it isn't "official" yet either. Hopefully there will be something sparkly on them, our current unis are way too bland... Other than that, apparently a few (I think) shows were added to our schedule, including one in Kansas. Apparently I raked in a good amount of dough for the corps, thanks to the freakin FOURTEEN addresses that I brought in (and sad puppy faces that I drew on the insides of the letters). Surprisingly, nothing was said about the announcement of our show title, although plenty was said about good behavior and corps representation on DCP. Aren't there only 3 (possibly 4 with Trevor) B corps members registered? Heh, I never post, Chelsea only brags about us, that leaves one monkey, cough. We'll see if anything changes.  The  most  important announcement of the year? We're going to finals!
