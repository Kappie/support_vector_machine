The idiots were awsome. favorite time durin these two years where great...especaily the GRAVITY GAMES!!!  awsome .  i had a few girl friends...most turned out to be a mistake...all but one.  il miss all of you guys back in parma a lot...i might have friends here but you guys were true friends.                              -pat
