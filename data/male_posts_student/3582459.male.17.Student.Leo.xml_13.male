I've decided that things I post here will be largely for personal edification and clarification.  It seems today that Christians are seen as increasingly closed-minded and conformist. This perception has come about as a result of some (generally conservative) Christians putting topics such as creationism vs. evolution and swearing ("family values") at the forefront of their political agendas, when in reality such debates, while worthwhile to some people, are really trivialities.   When non-Christians people hear of the science teacher in rural Tennessee being fired for teaching the big bang and evolution (not sure if this exact incident happened but this general idea has been publicized), or the Kansas school board removing any mention of evolution from its standardized tests, non-Christians see closed mindedness, anti-intellectualism, and mental conformity. In reality, it doesn't matter one bit to an individual's faith whether he literally interprets the first part of Genesis believes that God directly created the world in six days of twenty four hours, or figuratively interprets that same part and concludes that God created somehow used evolution and the big bang. Indeed, Jesus never really talked extensively about the creation of the world in his fleeting years on Earth.  Some Christians seem to believe that swearing is a cardinal sin, as if the Bible says, "do not say these following words: blah blah blah blah." In reality, the Bible doesn't have such a list. I don't swear because swearing is disrespectful and offensive; I don't swear because I have the fruit of the Holy Spirit. It really doesn't matter if the non-Christian cuss or don't cuss, as clean language is at most a result of striving to show the love of God to others. Indeed, I know some people would rather tell the heathens not to swear than tell them about the love of Christ Jesus, or at least it appears that way. Paul says that evevrything is permissible, but not everything is beneficial (1 Corintians, 10:23); swearing and clean language fall in this category.  Partly for the reasons I have enumerated, Christians sometimes come off as closed minded and conformists when they try to push orthodoxy in behaviour and thought when such orthodoxy is wholly unnecessary, often using trivialities to eclipse or even exclude non-trivialities from meaningful dialogue. The United Church of Christ (formerly the congregationalists) put it well: "in essentials, unity; in nonessentials, diversity"--in other words, in essentials like the divine and messianic nature of Jesus Christ, unity, in nonessentials like belief in creationism, diversity.   This not to say that I am perfect; I am human and am prone to my own hypocrisies and sins, and indeed have generally been a weak witness for God in past. One of the youth counselors at Lord's Grace, Craig Ing, says that we Christians should major in the majors (divinity of Jesus, personal relationship with God, great commission ), and minor in the minors (creationism, different amount of water in baptism, whether one should be baptised before taking commuinion, ). The Christian community could do better to minor in the minors and major in the majors. I've been rather successful at minoring in the minors, but need to work on majoring in the majors in my spreading the word.
