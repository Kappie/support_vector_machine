(aka my knee is now fucked up...) i can't do either.... what a great summer this is turning out to be... and dammit... i actually thought things were turning around... how naive can i be.... well it just goes to show...its true...why have dreams when they are only eventually shattered... its only inevitable and its only my life... and sometimes i wonder if its worth the trouble at all... going to bed with a heavy heart, sore knees, and tired eyes.... - Nate
