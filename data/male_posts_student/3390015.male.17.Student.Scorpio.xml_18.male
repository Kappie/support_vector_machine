For example, we know that we do have a purpose, and there is more to our existence than this world...meaning God exists independent of us.  Then you get to the fact that God is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end...He is eternal...no beginning and no end...  ^That will boggle the mind.  Just think about it in succession:  1. We exist, we are conscious..."I think, therefore I am."  2. God brought us into existence supernaturally through his divine and everlasting power.  3. God is eternal, having no beginning nor end.  4. Wait...back up...no beginning nor end...eternal...let that sink in, and it will truly make your head hurt!  Our finite minds only know things to have a beginning and an end...so we seek to find what "caused" God or what is "beyond" God...and to our best knowledge, revealed to us in the Bible, we know that there is nothing but God, and that's where the bewilderment begins to set in.  I'll take something from the Matrix Revolutions: "Everything that has a beginning has an end."  That's all the world can understand, though there are few of us who can accept it [God is eternal] and understand it to a degree, but our minds are finite, and therefore we will never understand "eternity" without the help of God, hopefully this will be explained to our finite minds in Heaven!  There are lots of things that can easily boggle our finite minds, such as this simple example:  1. Our brain seeks to learn about itself, and succeeds - that's insane!   "Consciousness" is also mind boggling.  Some of these questions can really hurt your head if you think about them to hard!  *Disclaimer* I am not responsible for headaches, migraines, or any other ill related to reading and then thinking about these uber-complicated ideas.
