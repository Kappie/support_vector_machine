I was sitting in English and everyone around me was writing and I was hardcore stressed, so I just started writing and I immediately started feeling better.  Ms Christian asked me how I was and I hesitated before saying I was fine.  As soon as I said that I felt bad because I'm sure she was genuinely worried about how I was and I lied to her.  However, if I had said I wasn't fine I'm sure I would have broken down.  I feel like crap.  Anyway, here's the poem:  Beauty repose, archaic remembrance Allude to your final sleep Death walks, shallow grave in the hollow garden Flowing dreams, anaesthetized and bloodied Melodic or elusive, no scenes narcotic Trampled and ignored, feeling Lost without sense, fall under Why?  Reality doesn't allow such thoughts Forget portentous happiness Rage, desire, locked within Escape forever, no more, no less Don't bleed, black is dead Neither red nor key-like Understand, the train passes Escape.  Forget.  Believe. Never again, cornered solidity Monotony, sequential relief, worry not Sleep child, do not weep Authenticated belligerence, sway forward Poverty of the soul, and forget all.
