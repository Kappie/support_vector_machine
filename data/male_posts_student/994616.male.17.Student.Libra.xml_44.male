ITs 80s, its random, its funky, its catchy its everything a song should be. In fact it even has a catchy, marketable, slogan "'m Lovin' It" Of course due to new copy protection stuff -a-ma-jig  don't actually have the song, however right now I'm listening to  X Gonna Give It To Ya  by DMX for more info on them click  urlLink here . I'd give this song about 3 stars out of 5
