Sarah is always hilarious to sit next to during the service.  She always keeps me entertained, her and alecia's pen. haha  Well after church I got to go home for an hour then I went to work.   Well I am sure all of you can guess how that went.  I hated it.  At the end of my shift I had $1200 in my till!  Plus some of the people were arguing and I had to deal with dumb customers.  Sometimes I wonder if God is trying to tell me to look into a new job.  I don't think I would like any other job though in this town.  I also get pretty good pay and hours at McDonalds.  I just don't like some of the people that work there.  So many of them aren't going anywhere in thier lives(imagine that, thats probably why they are at McDonalds)  It seems like so many of them just care about getting stoned, drunk, etc.  Its depressing sometimes.  On the other hand I feel like I should stay there for the sake of some of my regular customers and so I can at least help the place to run half-way smooth.  I don't know.  It seems like such a stupid situation, but I really hope God helps me through it.   Anyways tommorow isn't going to be any better, because I have to clean the whole day.  I have a list with 73 things to do.  Thats inviting huh?  I am so not looking forward to it.  Hopefully it won't be hard.  Who knows, maybe it will be better than dealing with customers.  Well that was a pretty depressing day huh?  Well I got to get to bed since I have to be to work in 10 hours. ughh
