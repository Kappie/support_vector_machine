Noteworthy things in Arizona were....  Gas is really freakin expensive It rained It was really freakin cold It got sunny It was still cold Our hotel was really cool The kids on the team were stupid Some kids got stuck in an elevator after an e-stop  (HAHAHAH!) I took random pictures and most of them turned out Food was good Mexican food is always good  Its about a 7-8 hour drive out so I had to be shoved into some car and sit in there for the whole drive which sucked.  On the way home we stopped at some casino and it sucked because we had no more gas money after we gambled.  The drive home was much more tolerable than the drive up.  Mainly because right when I got home I slept.  Anyways, pics will be up soon.  I'm happy as a clam to be back home, but...I'm kinda hungry and pissed off.  So...bye.
