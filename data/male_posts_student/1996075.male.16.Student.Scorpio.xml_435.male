Well, maybe not that long, but just consider the fact that I'm posting at 2:35 in the am, and it has been completely overcast for two days now...you get the idea...  Anywho, the days since school ended have been pretty fun, not the best they could be, but all in all I don't have many complaints - I just hope I can keep up this whole staying up late to watch adult swim and comedy central cartoons - the only way to spend the late night when your friends dont usually stay up that late. But yeah, I managed until about 5.30 last night/morning and could have done even better if I didn't have to worry about being late for stuff that I had to do mid-afternoon (thats when you know you've slept late...).  So yeah, late nights, movie nights, its all gone pretty well for the past 5 days (or so).  -mikeo   "I'm not going there to die...I'm going to find out if I'm really  alive "
