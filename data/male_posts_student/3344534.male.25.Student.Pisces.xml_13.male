Along with boomboxes and barking dogs, city elders seemed concerned about protracted exposure to the jingle emanating from the 250 Mister Softee ice cream trucks that lumber through the streets of New York. that's totally ridiculous!  wtf is THAT?!  you can't just tell mister softee to shut up like that!  it's preposterous!  i am outraged!  i am angry!  i'm not going to take it from the man anymore!  THE MAN MUST GO DOWN!  the one main reason that mister softee should NOT be silenced is... because of the jingle, you can tell the difference between softee and a softee imposter.  there are trucks out there that are painted the same colors as an official softee truck... they are tricky like that.  without the classy tune... you might run down the street chasing one of these imposters and when you finally catch up... find out that you had been had by a fake!  with the song however, you can rest assured that you are getting the real thing.  on the flip side... with the softee song, you KNOW when he's in your neighborhood... and you can run around the streets (as i have done on many occasions) trying to track him down.  so... not only does the jingle signal the beginning of summer... but it serves as a public benefit for those in search of this TASTY BITCH.  besides... half the fun is trying to track him down.  in response to this attack on my good warm weather friend mister softee... i am going to create a petition and submit it to the bloomberg administration.  i am going to ask for the support of all softee lovers past and present who have bought from a mister softee truck in new york city.  please check back here in the next week or so, as i want to get the right wording, grammar, spelling, etc., down before i put it up on petitiononline.  thanks for your prompt attention to this matter.  we must resist!  btw... did you notice in the upper right hand corner of the nytimes link it says... "printer-friendly format sponsered by"?  i clicked on the printer-friendly format for the article... cause it's easier to read.  but even printer-friendly formats have sponsers now apparently.  anyone find that at least a little disturbing?
