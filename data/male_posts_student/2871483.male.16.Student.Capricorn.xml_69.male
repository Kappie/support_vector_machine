Well, this really isn't all that bad, Outkast is one of three rap groups I can tolerate.  -  "I've got a disease, and the only cure is MORE COWBELL!"  -  My minidisc software decided to throw an attitude at me today.  It wouldn't convert any of my songs.  So, I get the CD, reinstall it (took twenty minutes on my piece of shit computer) and try again.  Same problem.  Finally, it asked if I want to do something with backing it up when I was doing something COMPLETELY unrelated to it.  So I did.  Works fine, now.  -  I was kinda preoccupied on Friday to post everything that happened.  My parents went to Seaside Wednesday afternoon, so my sister and I were held up at the Gramms' house.  I was out in the trailer (Yeah, I was sleeping in a trailer, big deal, it was privacy.), and I was able to do anything I wanted outside of setting something on fire, so, naturally, I snuck out.   Painfully simple when you already are technically outside.  I went to Taco Bell and took a very long walk about some places, woke a few people up, and it was raining the whole time.  Felt like goddamn Florida, walking through water and whatnot.  Nobody wished to venture with me, which kinda sucked, but, you know, gave me alone time I guess.  Thursday came along, boring school day, went over to the house again, and did nothing.  Took a nap, woke up at nine, and snuck out again, this time went to blockbuster and got a movie and got a bunch of snackage from a convienience store.  Went back, and, thats about it.  Friday.  Woke up to Grandpop screaming into the intercomm and what not.  Normal start.  I get ready, get out the door, don't get too far and then I realize with a look at my watch that I would be late.  Well, luckilly for me, I've got a load of driving-age friends on McGillivray, so it was only a matter of time before Erin, who lives across the street from my Grandparents (and pretty hot to boot.), pulled over and asked if I needed a lift.  We were at school in no time, thanks in part to her insane driving.  We were going between 35 and 40, weaving between cars and what not.  Scary.  Got to school, and the day has already been commented on in Friday's post.  Came home on the bus, which I do so sparingly now, it's like an adventure.  Got home, parents were back, got two posters, a Beatles one and a 'Vett one, neat stuff.  Kim's birthday was then.  So, I just watched The Office upstairs, naturally.  Cheesecake, though, couldn't miss that.  Went to bed at three Friday night, while unbeknownst to me, my parents were planning to attack me in the morning with an ungodly amount of chores.  So, I wake up at ten, to my dad yelling something about lawn mowing.  Worked all day, ate, and watched movies. Went to bed at three again.  Woke up at ten again on Sunday, only this time, I was able to get back to sleep, my comatose state I have when I sleep after being sleep deprived saved me for any work untill, get this, 3 PM.  Three in the fucking evening!  I wasted my day!  Kind of.  Ate Chinese food, and watched Game Four (Suck it, Lakers, you're getting your asses kicked in so many ways.)  Thats about it.  -  It's weird.  I finished some T.V. a little while ago, came into my room, looked at the clock, 4:20 on the dot.  Funny.  -  I'm gonna be so tired for school, I really do wanna go.  But my parent's will use the classic "You've missed too much school" which is bullcrap because, from what they know, I've only been absent a total of four and a half days this semester.  In truth, there's countless skips you have to count, but they didn't know that.  -  Summer school is going to fucking suck.  That plus a job is gonna kill my summer leasure time.  -  Did you ever notice a lot of the gum like Ice Breakers and what not are packaged like medication?  What's with that?  -  Damn, it gets light out earlier and earlier.  It's 4:41 as I type this, and the sun's rising.  -  I watched this thing on T.V., called "Crossroads"(No, not the Britney Spears flick).  It's thing thing where they take two bands, one rock, and one country, and mash them together on stage.  The one I saw was ZZTop and Brooks  Dunn.  It was really neat, especially the guitar work.  -  Here's a kinda gross little anictdote I'm sure we've all been through.  I'm mowing the lawn, right, and I thought I had stepped in dog crap.  So, I look at my shoe while walking, you know, kinda hop and glance.  And, in the process of that, I actually DO step in dog crap.  Frusterating.  -  Something that sounds frightening:  Use two Eclipse Mints cases as slides on the guitar.  -  I have like, five 365 calanders I got from my Aunt who knows how long ago.  I now remember why don't like them.  I glanced over at the one on my desk.  Yeah, the date says March 18.  -  Okay, so, there's this bag I brought back from Gramms' house, right?  It was full of stuff I had over there.  I had, among my clothing, four bottles of Mountain Dew, a box of Ritz Bits Sandwitches, two cans of Pringles, a half eaten box of Mike 'n' Ikes, and a bag of Jet Puff Marshmellos.  Somehow, I mangaged to eat everything in that bag on Friday.  -  I think I should make a sculpture out of the AOL CD's a recieve and take from various places.  They seem like they're going to waste.  -  I've had these script ideas, four of them, floating through my head for a couple weeks.  And then, last night, just like that I was struck with an idea.  I shall combine them into one script!  More details later.  -  I have this pack of No Doze I lifted from my mom about two weeks ago.  I looked now at what I have left.  Two.  Just two.  -  I was rumaging through my pile of trash the other day, and came across something.  A pig, made out of a Hawiian Punch bottle and some Tippex.  I think I named him, shit, what was his name... well, I can't remember.  -  There's a double gulp cup that has been sitting on my desk for so long now I don't think I even remember where I got it from.  -  GEORGE.  GEORGE THE TUMOUR PIG!!  I remember!  -  I want a Hat FM.
