Okay, I've been writing in my other blogs for the last couple of days, but I suppose I should come back to the real world (a.k.a. the blog that's actually being read) and update you on the ultra-cool things going on in my life right now:  1.  Corrigan I know, it's strange.  Who would have thought that something I used to think was some highly-overrated spit-swatting fest could turn out to be one of the best things that could have happened in my life right now?  I mean, it was, in a word, incredible.  The fact that I got to spend nearly every day after school with my friends for a week is in itself truly awesome because usually we're all so busy.  Nevertheless, we all managed to have a great time bowling (Monday), eating dessert/watching American Idol/playing games at Rachel's (Wednesday), taking pictures at Emily B.'s house (Thursday), and lugging Taylor, who is in so many ways the Guru Sage Master King of All That Is Photography, over to Emily S.'s house to take candid shots that ended up being not so candid/watching great movies at Jenny's house (Friday).  The cool thing is that I've made a new friend (Cacen, a.k.a. Calcon/Calconian), met a new person (Pierre Morin, whom I've been hearing a lot about but have never really met, and generally had an awesome week.  However, one thing that it awakened me to is how distant my friend Alec and I have grown.  I mean, we used to be best friends, and now we hardly talk to each other.  It just seemed...I don't know, awkward, I guess.  Hmmm...guess we'll have to work on that.  2.  Snow Yes, that's right, I said the s-word.  You don't usually use such a word in Texas unless referring to it as something that those "damn Yankees" have, but we actually had SNOW on Friday and Saturday.  How cool was it to look out the window during PreCal and see a couple of flakes fluttering to the ground and have a couple of girls running to it and shouting, "Blizzard!  It's a blizzard!"  Pretty soon, snow was blowing all over the place.  Man, I love snow.  I never actually went out into it, but it  looked  cool, you know?  Plus, it kept me from having to go work boot camp on Saturday.  It was so nice not to have to wake up at 5:30 to get ready, then be on my feet for about 9-10 hours.  Mmmm...  3.  A Song for PaPa  Okay, so my mom told me on Friday that my grandfather took some tests that showed that his pancreatic cancer (which he fought this past summer) is showing signs of coming back.  This was on the way home from school.  As soon as I got home, I went straight to my dad's computer (on which I have Sibelius 3) and began working on a song that I call  A Song for PaPa , PaPa being the name that I call my grandfather, as a gift for her to take to him when she goes to visit him in Austin on Thursday.  I really think this is my best song yet, and it captures the spirit of my grandfather and his fight against this thing that he  will  overcome.  I know he will.  Somehow, someway, someday, he will.
