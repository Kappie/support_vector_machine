Well, the past wks have been quite smooth going for me, can u imagine, this is already the 4th wk of my course, in 5 wks time, would be the dateline for the projects to be handed up and in 6 wks time, would be the exams.. Time really flies, i just feel that i only started course yesterday. No matter wat, it's the only truth that this is the 4th wk and it's about time i buck up and really study damm hard.   So far, for my course, i've learnt hw to cook soup, make sauces, and today we learnt hw to debone a chicken. u ppl might think that it's easy, but when it comes to real task, sweat keeps dripping, one thing, scare that would cut my hand, lol.. well, just have to be careful. Then we also learnt hw to fillet a sea bass. Finally can learn some real skills. haha.   And nxt wk, we would finally start cooking the main course. haha. after learning the skill, i'm going to put it to test on my friends.. hehe  Well, think that's all for nw, hope i wouldnt be lazy to come online to blog soon..   Cheers Thomas
