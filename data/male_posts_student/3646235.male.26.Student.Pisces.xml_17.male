It seems all the people I know that have a strong faith are almost extreme.  That's all they can talk about and they are rigid in their beliefs.  Well, not everyone.  John has a strong faith and I don't see that in him.  Maybe the people I think don't have a strong faith actually do, they just don't talk about it.  How strong is my parent's faith?
