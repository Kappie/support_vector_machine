Which is most of the time. While I'm on about it, who the  fuck  honestly believes that they can make their penis '3-4 inches bigger' just by taking pills? How do the people behind this product intend to make money? Most people with half a brain realise that a pill can't physically change you - other than maybe giving you an ulcer or possibly killing you...  Some Oasis guy is on The Panel at the moment... fuck, I hate that voice
