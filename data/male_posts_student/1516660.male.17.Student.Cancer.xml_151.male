After that, watched Digimon Frontier and many other cartoons. After that went online and chatted with XC and Wendy.   Lunch Mom cooked the Japanese Udon! Hmm! Long time no eat le! I oplayed FFIX while eating. I completed Mount Gulag and found my 2nd Chocograph Treasure. I am gonna play more later.   After lunch, I went to 768 to buy Seventeen for Wendy. Luckily, G Value has it, so I brought one for $3.90 (which she returned me later). Took 913 to her house.  We studied E-Maths there. I completed my revision for Maths! YaY!! I felt kinda confident. But only the results will tell everything! Let's hope tomorrow will be an easy paper! Then, I listened to Wendy's MDs. I sang End Of The Line. While singing that, I envisioned myself singing, and also WQ. Then, I realised that I was wrong. For all those things I did. It's good. I realized my own mistake! Hmmm. Wendy said "Finally!". HaHa! Oh yeah, I also didn't take the Primrose Eveing Oil. I am scared her brother will catch me swallowing the pill. HaHa!   Then Hann called and asked me SS questions. After that, we went outside to see her brother play Harvest Moon.  At 5.45, we went out to eat. Me and Wendy ate Chicken Chop rice and her mother Half Chicken Rice Set. It was delicious! Yum! I brought back BBQ Wings Rice for brother.  I reached home and took a bath. You know, or may not know, today's Mabon. Mabon is a Sabbath, a festival! This day is some sort like the witches' version of Thanksgiving. I joined in the celebration by arranging 10 of my votive candles into a TY shape, representing Thank You. As I lighted each candle, which signifies my sincere thanks and appreciation, I said my thanks to the God and the Goddess and my ancestors (I expeically mentioned my great-grandmother and godfather). I felt so special...as this is my first Sabbath celebration. :)  Then, I wrote this blog. Here. I think I am gonna stop now. Goodnight blog! See ya!
