I tried to make a comment for Renae's last post but it was too long and it didn't post. -.-*  Let me see if I can paraphrase it here...  Not all wars are stupid. There are just reasons to go to war. They were given to us by St. Augustin, a Christian philospher.  ~There has to be a just reason to go to war. (Defending oneself, or an ally. Preserving the peace)  ~The war has to be approved of by a lawfull authority. (The only lawful authority that has control in multiple nations is the UN)  ~The war must be for the betterment of mankind. (ie. Taking out Hitler so he doesn't cause more pain, suffering, useless deaths. Or the American Revolution which liberated the USA from England gave birth to democracy)  Although Mr. Bush would like us to believe otherwise, this war isn't a just war. The reasons for his war are oil. And no matter what he tells the U.N. or the rest of the world, that always was and always will be his reason.  As for us paying attention to the war. The reason we watch the war so closely is because  we  may be pulled into the war at any time. Someone may attack Continental USA, which we are so close to. Other countries may decide to join the war and soon may escalate to the third World War. The UN might decide to allow this war and Canada would go to war.  Either either, this war may affect us and change our lives at any time. That's why people pay so much attention to it!  -ArV
