This means that, although I'll be in France for most of the trials, I'll conduct the direct in most of the scrimmages and at least one of the trials, and my direct will probably be used at trial.  Looks good for college.  I'm kind of excited about France, even though it's not for twenty-six or so days.  I'm getting a camcorder to make a movie of the trip; Mme Engborg said not to bring a laptop, I probably won't need one.  I'm going to be living in the 13th Arrondissement, a "Rather ugly modern Chinese and Vietnamese quarter with many good, cheap Chinese restaurants," according to my guidebook.  Apparently, my aunt knows somebody who owns a restaurant there.  I'll talk more about this when it's closer to the trip.  My French host guy is never online, though.  School has begun again, I'm not too down; I just don't like having to think about long-term work.  Speaking of which, I should really do some of those commentaries... later.  ER Season One is really good.  I would recommend it.  And I even have time with no MUN today and little homework (I was already done at five even after watching an entire episode this afternoon).  That's just about it.  Here's a quote from today's history:  "Those who were buried... were buried!" ---Ms. Heidlage
