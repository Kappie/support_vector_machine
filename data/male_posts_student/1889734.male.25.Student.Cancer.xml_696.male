He presents himself as a 'balanced' journalist in both forums, but lately he appeared on Al Franken's show on Air America and made the following statements about Bush and the administration.  "Here are Alter's money quotes:  The level of incompetence is so staggering here, and yet there's this gap between how astonishingly incompetent - and we can go over particulars in the last year if you want to - how astonishingly incompetent they've been and the perception is still of them as solid citizens.  ... The only way you can sort of start to let the public know is to say, no, they don't know what they're doing. They're clowns."  Alter can think and say whatever he likes.  I have no problem with this.  However, I think most of us should be aware that political agendas can not be seperated from how one approaches the news.  Bias exists on both sides, and for pious journalists like Peter Jennings proclaim they have no opinion, these same people shape the news and our perception of what happens (witness the lack of good news from Iraq).    The casual voter needs to understand this bias when all they get in the way of news is the Daily Show, or CBS once a week.  I think that's why most uninformed of detached people wind up voting for the democrats...they've been shaped, and they aren't thinking much anyway.  Read more Blogs.  I think the mainstream media is in deep trouble, and the Bloggers are making serious inroads in picking up the responsibility of reporting that the media has casually tossed aside.  Right now, I'm getting more truth from the Blogs, and I'm getting stories and facts before they appear on the major sites.  And in many cases, I can spot errors that end up being corrected later on.  The Blogosphere might be the future of responsible reporting.  Oh, and I have no illusions that just because I have a Blog, I'm part of this.  This is nothing but a pale shadow of the real Blogs...
