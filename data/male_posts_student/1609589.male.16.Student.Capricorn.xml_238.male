I play tuba: nuttin much I play tuba: readin ur journal I play tuba: i wish i had stuff to bitch about ShuChoMouff: i just see shit like this in school, or its referred to, and i wonder if there's any way to make it interesting to me, which ends up being my bitching I play tuba: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I play tuba: well I play tuba: i wish i payed more attention ShuChoMouff: like I'm about to write about how Bush has no fucking right to ban gay marriages ShuChoMouff: i mean, why does he even care? I play tuba: is he banning it? I play tuba: is he trying? ShuChoMouff: hes trying to pass an amendment I play tuba: im going to assasinate him ShuChoMouff: we both are ShuChoMouff: ive had dreams about it I play tuba: with what? I play tuba: rockets launcher? ShuChoMouff: hmm... I play tuba: rockets launcher ShuChoMouff: we could make him eat mexican food till his colon explods I play tuba: ha! ShuChoMouff: or melts I play tuba: yea ShuChoMouff: whichever comes first ShuChoMouff: because mexican food explodes like a bitch I play tuba: i could fat in his face and make him die I play tuba: i think i said this at the lockin I play tuba: but I play tuba: the reason he is like this ShuChoMouff: no man, because a fart is a sign of manliness I play tuba: is cause hes from Texas ShuChoMouff: fucking texans ShuChoMouff: Nothing good(except the badass people i have found so far) has ever come from texas I play tuba: i know I play tuba: and it makes me mad  Then I started ranting about stuff even I didn't care about, then I went into my "disclosure agreement"  ShuChoMouff: want me to remove the ** in yer screenname? I play tuba: why would u do that? I play tuba: nah ShuChoMouff: so people dont spam you- i just do it to be nice I play tuba: its ok ShuChoMouff: well fuck you- i already did it I play tuba: lmao  So yeah, that puts my Bush agreement into perspective. I'll write about it again later when I don't have to succumb to the human requirement of knocking myself unconsious for 8 hours. Nighty night.
