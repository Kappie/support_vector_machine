Yeah, the Church has made it clear over the years (particularly in recent years) that the only recognized Holy union is between a priest and his alter boy. According to the news report, it took the Vatican two years to draft the 12 page document ( urlLink link ). That's six pages a year! With such a slow transmission rate, I have to wonder why Heaven doesn't just cough up the $50 a month for DSL?
