I spent most of my day eating myself crazy, and in result, getting heartburn. I've been getting heartburn occassionally since I was 12. I don't know why, but it hasnt really freaked anybody out, so why worry? My mom went out on a business trip and will be gone for a few days. WHOO HOO! PARTAY! (Actually this idea wouldn't be too far out of reach if I could somehow find a way to get my dad out of the house for a night, and that's not likely to happen.) Well, there is a downside to my mom being gone. No rides. My dad got this DUI and he can't drive after 4:30, so he's out of question. Trav just called and asked if I wanted to crash, but it's like 9:30 so I can't really bike all the way over there. Ahh well, w/e, it's all good. Yeah, the poem I wrote last night sucked ass. Sorry to use such language, but it was horrible. It sounded more like one of these blog entries than the real thing. I know I just got to get back into the groove of things, eventually I'll be writing like I used to. I think I'm going to head over to chris's tomorrow, maybe have some human interaction outside of my immediate family, or via phone.
