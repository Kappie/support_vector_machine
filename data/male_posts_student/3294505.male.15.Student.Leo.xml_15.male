Between crap from everyone and just all around stress, I usually end up going home, sitting there, and falling asleep at the keyboard, only to wake up and find that I drooled on my spacebar.  The only things that are keeping me relatively sane are my music, games, and the occasional skate session.  I should go take a nap now...
