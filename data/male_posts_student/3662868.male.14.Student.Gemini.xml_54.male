Here's to the kids who are different,    The kids they call crazy or dumb,   The kids who don't fit, with the guts and the grit,   Who dance to a different drum...   Here's to the kids who are different,   The kids with the mischievous streak,   For when they have grown, as history's shown,   It's their difference that makes them unique.
