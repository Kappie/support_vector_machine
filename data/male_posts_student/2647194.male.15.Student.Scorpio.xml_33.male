Then comes the permanent retainer. What fun...  I hope this stuff wears off soon. I don't want my lip feeling limp all day.  Well, in contrast to my last entry, I'll put here a list of misfortunes...lol: 1. Biking Accidents: -When I was about 4, I split my chin open when a wheel came off of a plastic tricycle. I remember it too...hurt like a bitch. -Riding my bike into the DQ parking lot a few years ago, my front wheel somehow became lodged on the driveway, so I went flying ass over teakettle. Even though I had my aerobars on the bike at the time, the first part of me that hit pavement: my chin. Felt so damn numb I didn't feel any pain. Needed 3 stitches too. -Riding my bike at 10:30 in the evening late last summer, I came upon a large patch of sand and grit on a corner. Being the racer I am, I took it like a racer. Slid over 5 feet too, wearing a t-shirt and, yep, shorts. To this day I still have a scar on my right elbow.  *Those are just some of the reasons why I always ride on the right side of the street and wear a helmet...lol*  Hmmm....surgeries...: 1. Ear Surgeries -Countless sets of tubes, starting when I was somewhere around 1 or younger -3 Mastoid ectomies (removing the mastoid bone in my ear because it was infected), 1 on the right and 2 on the left. Believe me, you don't ever want to have a big bandage around half of your head for 3 days-it gets unbearingly itchy. -A good amount of timpanoplasties (not sure how its spelled), which is when an ear drum is patched up.  *These are the reasons why I have hearing loss, and have to wear ear plugs a lot...dammit*  I'll stop there, because I don't want to sound like I'm griping or writing a book titled, "One Thousand and One Misfortunes"...lol. Thankfully, I've never broken a bone. I probably will though, if I ever get in a large pile up in a race *knocks on desk*.  I race and I ski recklessly...lol. If I didn't wear helmets, I might not be here today.  Here's a slightly appropriate song: "When I was 10, fell out of bed Got three stitches in my head It hurt like hell I saw the blood, I felt the pain I'd like to feel it once again 'Cause I don't feel it Then I got stung, right on the face I screamed and ran around the place It hurt like hell I swoll right up, I burned for days I'd like to feel it once again Cause when you touch me When you hold me When you kiss me I don't feel anything When you touch me When you hold me When you kiss me It's just like Novocaine I remember every cut and scrape I'm alone so long Something's wrong So I'll take anything I slap my face, I pull my hair Just to see if something's there It should hurt like hell I miss the pinch, I miss the pain That shock sensation in my brain Cause when you touch me When you hold me When you kiss me I don't feel anything When you touch me When you hold me When you kiss me I don't feel anything When you touch me (when you touch me) When you hold me (when you hold me) When you kiss me I don't feel it When you touch me (when you touch me) When you hold me (when you hold me) When you kiss me It's just like Novocaine I don't feel anything I don't feel it I don't feel it I don't feel it Well, I don't feel it No, I don't feel it I don't feel it"  "Novocaine", Alice Cooper
