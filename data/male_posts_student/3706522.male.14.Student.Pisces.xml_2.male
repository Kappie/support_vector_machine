If my friend Matt reads the email I sent him and isn't too big of a lazy bum to stay here for more than 2 measly seconds, he'll surely be dropping some kind of comment in here. He'll pretty much be a regular I think.  NEWSFLASH ALSO ALSO!  urlLink HomestarRunner.com  was updated yesterday, with the addition of  urlLink Strong Bad email #106 . That was pretty good, but it didn't make me burst out laughing like it's supposed to. Oh well, they can't all be gems. At least not to me, anyway. By the way, that "we're gonna have to jump" part at the end was actually somehow mildly cool. Weird. What the heck, LONG LIVE H*R!!   WS
