She has one of the nicest personalities around and everyone likes her. Her kisses are sweet as sugar, her touches as delicate as a feather. Although we are apart, the flame of our love burns stronger than ever before because of our dedication to have a future together. Without Melissa, there is no day, no night, no everlasting glow. May our light never die, forever shall we be together, in our thoughts and dreams. I LOVE YOU MELISSA!  urlLink     urlLink
