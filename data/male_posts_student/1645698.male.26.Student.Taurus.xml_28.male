It's the best thing ever.  Conrad, Doll, Dead', Sedgie, and hey, Hyperspaz, can you come?  I have Wednesday and Tuesday completely free, but Thursday and Friday before work I can do, too.  C'mon, lazy bums. ^_^  School is starting *very* soon, and we so need one last summer hang out.  *pouts*  I promise not to make anyone do Turkey in the Straw!  Number two - there's an Alexander Hamilton museum!!!!!  I want to go!  Number three - caught the kitten!  It took a freaking lot of effort - not a word out of you, Conrad!  And it's now sitting on my lap purring happily . . .you should all come over and see it.  It's name is Toby Scarmaker . . .Toby for Conrad, Scar was my original name for it, and it scratched me and mom up lots so she suggested I alter it slightly (the name, not the kitten).  Number four, not to be neglected - I went *shop-ping*!  *That was supposed to be trilled*  I spent over a hundred dollars, but I got so much *stuff*.  Clothes, bag, and thirty dollar shoes that are Naturalizers and *soooo* comfortable.  Well, we're going to Borders. . .That's an order.  ^_~  Love you all!
