We waited for about 15 mins then walked around town looking for everyone.  In the end we all went home because Craig had a paper round to do.  A few hours later we went back to town and watched "The Day After Tomorrow".  It was a bloody good film!  It was so realistic and the special effects we amazing.  I won't spoil it for anyone so if you wanna go and see it, go ahead lol.  Half way through the movie cut out and every was like "WTF" but it came on again afterwards.  Apart from that cockup the film was great.  I recommend it to anyone.  We went home after that, legs and arses aching because the cinema seats are so uncomfy with hardly any legroom (one of the disadvantages of being tall... argh!).  Chris went in and me and Craig called for James, thenw ent to see Jo and Annie who were off their heads.  We then went to Kaylas for a bit until it was time to go in.  I had a really nice Bird's Eye microwave roast lamb dinner, which are really scrumptious!  They're so tasty yet so cheap... well done Bird's Eye :D
