I had an icee from quik trip, and it never seemed to end. I had calzone for lunch from simple simon's. They don't have the greatest pizza, but they're calzone is the best that i've ever had. They baste it in some garlic butter\italian sauce. I had six pieces. I felt like i was about to explode.  But it tasted good, so it was all worth it. Now tonight I had a BLT. And it hit home. I didn't even know that I wanted one, but now I know.                  I'm going to help with Vaction Bible School with my new church tomorrow. Supposed to be helping the little guys sing along with the songs during the music part. I wasn't going to do it, I was a reserve of sorts. However, word of my incredible skills for herding children got out. So now I'm going to be helping with that from 9 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon. During this time, I will join and begin training on a swim team, mow the yard twice, and continue in my latin lessons. I have a very full week. Then I do it again (in a sense) next week. Except it's a camp for my age. Very full. I also might get a small, part time job detailing and cleaning out cars. Amazingly enough. I feel exhausted just talking about it. Maybe I'll go mow the yard if it has cooled down at all. It was\is so hot today. Heh, but then, I remember, that someone was burned much more than me. I'll come back and write something amazingly insightful later. Now, Onward to learning about better mechanical amusements, and business opportunities.
