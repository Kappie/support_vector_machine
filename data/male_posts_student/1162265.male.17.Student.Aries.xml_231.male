Support Haitian People! no U.S. intervention no IMF and World Bank Embargo  200 years ago, Haitians fought for and achieved Independence from France, and established the World's first Black Republic.  Today, Transnational companies, such as NIKE, DISNEY AND LEVI¹S and other clothes and textile manufacturers benefit from inhumanely low wages of workers which Haitians get paid in the 'Free Trade Zones' established under IMF and World Bank 'advice'.  These transnational companies, as well as large landowners in Haiti, are supporting attempts to overthrow the elected President Jean Bertrand Aristide and moderate programs of reform and wealth distribution.Some of the armed insurgents are former members of the 30 Duvalier Dictatorship, and some are convicted participants in massacres.  The United States, who occupied the country for nearly 30 years this century, who sponsored and supported the brutal Duvalier dictatorship, are considering Military Intervention to continue exploiting Haitians for their resources and labour.  Conscientious people of the World should stop another imperialist intervention.  Haiti should work for Haitians, not for Transnational companies!
