It shall be sad times to leave all of you, but then you can ponder how much you wish you could talk to me ;) ... or not. Anyways, it shall be joyous times as well, as I'm going to church camp. Also, I get to see a good friend of mine that I never see. Oh yes, Kimmy, I have a gift for you (I hope you like it)...      1 Corintios 13:13    Y ahora permanecen la fe, la esperanza y el amor, estos tres; pero el mayor de ellos es el amor.        Con mucho amor, Dan
