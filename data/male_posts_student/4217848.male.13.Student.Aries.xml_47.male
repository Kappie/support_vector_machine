Secrets range from never telling anyone you wet the bed until you were nine (Eww...), to not talking to your crush, to keeping the fact that your uncle hits you everyday locked up inside. Secrets can make you feel either really independent or really alone in the world.      The first type of secret i named is the trivial kind. It doesn't matter if anyone knows, the secret is just embarrassing or maybe just better kept to yourself. It doesn't hurt anyone to keep that kind of secret, and there wouldn't really be any point in telling. Just go ahead and keep those to yourself.      The second is a bit trickier. This kind of secret can go both ways as to how dangerous it is. If your crush already has a boyfriend or girlfriend, it would rude to tell them you like them. It won't kill you; you won't care about them in a week anyway. If there is no reason not to tell them, though, and you have liked that person for a long time and for a good reason, I think you ought to tell them. Who knows, you might even get a date out of it.       The last is the most painful and most concrete secret. If you are being hurt, especially if you are being threatened, it probably causes you pain to talk about. Despite threats and hurts though, someone should know if something that serious is wrong. You owe it to yourself and everyone else to take care of the problem.      It can be fun to see how long you can keep secrets. Just make sure that keeping them is worth the pain it might cause.        -Hunter M.
