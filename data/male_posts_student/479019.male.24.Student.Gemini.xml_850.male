However, I can't help but think of some the lessons in  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .  That was a brilliant fucking movie by the way, and I totally recommend it.  I guess one of the lessons of the movie is that you despite your wanting to forget things like your feelings, it's not something you can really erase. Part of this is due to the fact that underneath all the crappy memories, are good ones that your mind doesn't want to forget. However, those good memories are inexplicably tied to the bad ones. It's like the Facts of Life theme song.  It's funny though, despite all the stuff that the movie goes over... in the realm of blogs on Xanga, Livejournal, or wherever... people do seem to focus on the negative a lot more. People are archiving away their bad memories, instead of erasing them. Do we want to remember the bad? It is part of our lives afterall, and maybe that's why Kirsten Dunst's character does what she does at the end.  It helps us grow as a people?  Maybe I'm just evil, but I can laugh at most stuff from my past these days... I can entertain myself and others with stories about exes... In fact, I can joke about the drama in my life right now... but there's a lot of other stuff I just don't know about.  I mean I just don't know where my life is going, and there's still so much to figure out. The future past is not layed out like in the anti-narrative of the movie.  ***
