LoL..the looks of his dishes are great..i could smell it from my home even though its on tv..it smelt great when i tried it out but not exactly how it was done..loL..hmmm also,tonight RiRi nvr gave me any hugz or MuackZ..still waiting for it..but nvm..guess i wont get any.. =(  ~well nothing much happened today i  guess..ill type another one tmr..byez
