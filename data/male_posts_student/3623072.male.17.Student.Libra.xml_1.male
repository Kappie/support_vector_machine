So the lady says that's okay she will have a vanilla milk shake, a strawberry milk shake and a chocolate milk shake.   Once again the waiter tells her "Mam, we have no chocolate!" And once again the lady changes her order and says she will have vanilla cake, strawberry cake, and chocolate cake.   This time the waiter is mad and shouts "Mam, we have no chocolate. Let me try to explain this to you. Do you see the word van in the word vanilla?"   The lady replies, "Yes."   The waiter then asks her if she sees the word straw in the word strawberry and she once again replies yes.   Then he asks her if she sees the word fuck in the word chocolate and the lady says "There's no fuck in chocolate."   And the waiter exclaims, "Exactly! THERE'S NO FUCKIN CHOCOLATE!"
