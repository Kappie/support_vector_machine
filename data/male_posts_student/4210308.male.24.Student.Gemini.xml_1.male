I work at a Costco...   you know...   everything in biggie size portions...   grocery/whatever the hell you need kind of store...   and beautiful women are a staple of the environment...   today...   mind you, I'm a cashier...   I had two sets of two stunners...   like..."Daaammmnnn" kinda girls...   come through my line...   one chick I knew from high school...   she got thick...   in a good way...   and all sorts of high school girls...   with their parents of course...   Back to School shopping...      I mean left and right...   was just...."Ooh"...."Damn"..."Wow"...   I mean I catch eye contact with a lot of these girls...   and that's about it...   partly because I'm shy...   but mostly because I have a girlfriend...   right now...   we're seperated...   if we make it to September...   that would be...   8 YEARS!!...   She's on some soul searching tip...   she needed space...   sometimes space is good...   sometimes space is...   lonely..      I guess that only time will reveal...   if me and her will get back together...   I give it about a 90% success rate...   yeah...   we've been through some shit...   but through the shit...   we've battled hard...   I mean I love her more than I dislike her actions and attitude...   She's a good girl...   who has never done me dirty...   I do miss her...   her mama's cooking...   her dogs..   her stepdad...   who looks like he would put murder on fools...   her lil brother...   reminds me of me...   her BMDub...   her stupid...   but cute songs...   and most of all...   her smell...
