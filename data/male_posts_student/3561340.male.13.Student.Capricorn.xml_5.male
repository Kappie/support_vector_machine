Hope it works out with her, even though shes moving. :-( Well at least I wont be too far away from her when Im at Hun. :-) I dont have enough time to go into detail about Alissa, because there is too many good things for me to say about her. Once again school was gay and absolutely nothing happened, except we have begun our SS essays on US-Mexican War. Then I had my lacrosse game. We won. Damn our team is really good. We were something like 11-3 on the season. I had an assist today. Go Me! I think thats my 3rd on the season. 1 goal and 3 assists so far. Saturday we have our Mohawks festival, which is a bunch of games all in one day. That will be cool. You should come check it out. It will be at Bundt pretty much all day. But.... before the games I get to take the SSAT's:-( thats gunna suck. O well, they shouldnt be too hard, even though Im taking the 8th grade test and have done barely any studying(all I did was 1 practice test and my scores as a 7th grader were better than my brothers as an 8th grader) Hopefully Im not goin to school tomorrow becuase I have no desire to sit in a room with Robbie and John for over an hour. By the way, that suspension was complete bullshit. I swear all I did was throw a bagel. But then a bunch of lesbians went and said that I was the one that pushed Robbie. To any of those lesbians that are reading this all I have to say to you are these two beautiful words(almost as beautiful as Alissa): FUCK YOU.... I could use a few more words but I dont want to offend any virgin eyes. Well thats enough for now. Peace
