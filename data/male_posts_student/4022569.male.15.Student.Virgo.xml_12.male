Anyway I read a note that said I needed black pants for my show choir retreat tomorrow and told my mom about it and I went to go get pants, but of course we left the store with a lot of other items. I came home ate and got tons of other things unpacked. Then after hanging around my house for awhile Sean came over with Allison and we pretty much drove around and listened to show tunes. I know I know, it sounds boring but it's really fun. We just listened to Little shop of horrors and its was very strange that I could still remember a lot of the choreography, I remember sitting in green room playing cards trying to figure out why the intercom wouldn't work. If your are not in theatre you are missing out. There is such a rush when you make your first entrance, or delivering the punch-line. The shows make all the work worth it. I truly honestly pray to god our theatre department continues to thrive and keep its reputation as the best drama department in town.
