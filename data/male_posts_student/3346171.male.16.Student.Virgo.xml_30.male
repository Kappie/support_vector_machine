Pass now an anti-virus in your brain! If you detect any of these viruses, delete it immediately:  Virus 1: thought always/never: this virus happens when you think that something that happened in the past, is gonna repeat in future, or that you’ll never get what you want. Virus’s variants: nobody is gonna call me, i’ll never get a rise, everyone takes advantage at me, my children don’t listen to me. When you realize that you have this virus, delete it using the programs of your conscience.  Virus 2- The virus of negativism: happens when your feelings reflect just the bad side of a situation and ignore any other good part. Delete it with the program optimism.   Vírus 3 – the vírus of foresee the future: this terrible virus happens when you foresee the worst possible result of what people are thinking about a situation. It provokes a collapse  in your initiatives, making you give up before trying. The antivirus for this virus in “waking up”.

Virus 4- the virus of the reading minds: this virus is always acting when you think that you know what people are thinking about you, even they didn’t tell you anything.

Virus 9 – the virus of guilt: reaplace words like: I should, I ness, I could, I have to… Use words like: I want, I will, I can do this like that… Do not stay centered in the past.

Virus 7 – the virus of retulation : everytime that this virus puts a label on yourself or even on somebody else, it detains your capacity of having a clear vision of a situation: variants – dizzy, frigid, arrogant, irresponsible and millions more  of auto- installing  labels. The label generalizes, making people’s reality in virtuals images of unaffected imagination. The best anti-virus for it is the “ conscience amplification exe”.  Virus 8- the virus of personalization: it makes you take all to the personal side. Exemple: when some one looks at you with a bad face and does not says hello, the virus makes you believe that obviously this person is mad at you. The “ conscience amplification exe” deletes very well this virus  Virus 9: the vírus blame other exe.: this is the worst thought’s virus! When you blame automatically people for the problems of your life, this virus makes it impotent for reponsabilizing  you for your own destiny. Unable to change anything. Use the” self-esteem antivirus” and stop to project on other people your own blame.
