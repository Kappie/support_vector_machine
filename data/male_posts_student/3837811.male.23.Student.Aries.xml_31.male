Im sure its the same for everyone, but thank goodness, had quite a day today..  Went down to the temple at Waterloo Street with my parents tis afternoon, to bai bai.. after that, went down to suntec city to lunch at Crystal Jade (to shelyn: *blink blink* lol), ate until my stomach nearly bursted, shiok-anation! There is tis Tangs sale at suntec city hall 402 today, and so, we went down, my dad and mum went on a shopping-spree, shoes, tupperwares, titbits, etc etc.. but i bought nothing lar... lol  While waiting for my mum to come out of the toilet, there's tis plump guy who is so plump, tat he cant walk, and he was on a wheelchair.. I saw it once and turned away, but the passer-bys kept pointing and looking at the poor guy.. He's already at tis state, cant they be more considerate? Wat if everybody looks and points at them, will they like it? Oh well, singaporeans......  After that, my dad went on a shopping-spree at Courts, bought a Toshiba 29 inch digital TV, a Panasonic Dvd Recorder and an Epson Printer (for me lar, my printer is spoilt, but then paying him back with my incoming pay).. I sympathised with the sales assistant, why? My dad kept bugging him for discounts and free gifts, lol.. He kept saying the price is discounted price already, but my dad just kept going on and on.. Guess wat? The sales assistant said: I will give u a 30dollars Robinsons voucher.. Woh, my dad's stunt worked.. LOL  Saw  urlLink Mel's  band's,  urlLink LGF , gig at the area outside Carrefour.. They started by singing Xiao Xiao's Ai yao tang dan dan.. Nice song, one of my favourites.. Sang a few of their own hits too, nice...     Mel is the drummer   Went home with my parents after the gig, and i was tinking of packing my computer table a bit.... Ended up, i did a mini spring cleaning on my own, and i cant believe tat the room is actually my room when i finished, even my mum was like: So li hai? So fast finish packing liao...., lol, felt so accomplised....       BEFORE (PIG STY)        AFTER (YES, I DID IT!)
