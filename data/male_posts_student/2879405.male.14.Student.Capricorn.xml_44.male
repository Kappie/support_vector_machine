More confidence have been pumped into me, every batter comes, every batter goes. I started 1st, doing fairly well. The team became motivated like how we used to be in the SRC. Nevertheless, we're still united as a team, undivided. The score was  36-2 , i pitched for 4 innings, only 3 strike-outs. Gary replaced me for batting and pitching, must give everybody chance lar. Gary also didn't perform to coach's expectation and couldn't get to pitch in the last inning, so hai wei took over to do a stunning good job.
