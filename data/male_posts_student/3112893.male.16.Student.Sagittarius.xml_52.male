Would I leave and go to a neutral country and wait it out? Would I fight for my homeland? Would I fight for the other side? And in trying to answer all these questions, I had to ask myself "What does America mean to me?" meaning why do I love it? Do I even love it? Is it the land, the people, or the philosophy or the ideals or a little bit of all that makes me so attached to the place? And of course, what makes me not want to move to any other place, even after taking into consideration all the flaws in this country?  I came to the following conclusion, I would fight for my country, but not because any president or leader me so, but because I'd be fighting for something more than just an individual. I'd be fighting for an idea, no matter how poorly US keeps to it now, that you are nothing if not free to express and think what you want. It's kind of like how that guy, I forget his name, but he said something to the effect of "I may disagree with what you say, but I respect it and will die for your right to say that." So, yeah, I'd fight for my country despite it's flaws because the ideals are great, not necessarily the individuals we have in place now.  In conclusion, I'm not afraid to fight and die for something, I'm just very skeptical about what is worth such an expense.  I love The United States of America, forever my home.  That is all. -- Feanor
