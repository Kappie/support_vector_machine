Since  urlLink Barack Obama's excellent speech at the DNC  went over so well, the Republicans have been scrambling to find a candidate to oppose Obama's run for US Senate. That search has stopped at  urlLink Allan Keyes' back door ...in Maryland.  Yes, the same party that complained incessantly about Hillary Clinton's run for Senate has now done the same thing. Nice job there, Republicans. Silly me, I thought John Kerry was the " urlLink King of Flip Flops ."  And this move doesn't scream "We're running scared" to me. Not at all.
