The oily, ominous image of Kiw loomed in her mind. If he could blackmail the Minister, he could do anything. He could take over the school.   As she turned into the classroom, she saw that their teacher wasn’t there yet. Sitting down, she was soon surrounded by a crowd of Huffelpuffs who wanted to hear the conversation she had heard. (Of course, news got around at Hogwarts.)   She was about to begin when the swish of black robes interrupted her. She expected to see Professor Siva but was instead greeted by the face-with-the-mole. She felt her jaw drop, and could almost hear the angry whispers coming from all around her.   “Why the hell does he have to be here?” Jeremy hissed from behind.    Cheryl shrugged. Perhaps he’s blackmailed Professor Siva, she thought dully. That didn’t seem like an illogical conclusion.   “Professor Siva somehow cannot be found in Hogwarts,” Molekiw began with a smirk on his face, “and so I am taking over his lessons. Turn to... page 226 of your textbook. We will be starting on the Reductor Curse, which blasts anything in its path. For example, take a look at this table.”   Kiw rolled up his sleeves and pointed his wand directly at the teachers’ table. “ Leducto !”   Nothing happened. Perhaps it was because Kiw couldn’t pronounce  r ’s and  l ’s properly.    Kiw cleared his throat, and tried once again. “ Leducto !”    Nothing. A few of the girls giggled while the guys withheld snorts.   “Oh, very funny is it?” Kiw asked, but his voice had lost some of its conviction. “How about if I put you in my path instead?”   “His aim’s so bad, I’d be more scared if he were aiming for the thing next to me,” Jeremy whispered gleefully from behind, sniggering. Matt, who was sitting beside him, was rolling about his seat in silent, hysterical laughter.    “I have a meeting to attend now. Er... I want two feet of parchment on the usage of the  Leductor  – er,  Reductor  Curse, to be handed in on Thursday, no excuses.” And with that, Kiw left the classroom.   That shut the guys up.   “Bloody idiot,” Matt swore from behind. “I swear, one day I’ll use whatever curses we’ve learnt against him. Not that we’re learning anything from him at the moment.”   “Priceless moment, that was,” Muthu said, laughing. “ Leducto !  Leducto ! So much for being effectively bilingual,” he continued, stating the fact that Kiw was, of course, extremely Oriental, especially in terms of speech. There was a strong accent when he spoke English – one that caused occasional gaffes such as this.   “Well, it’s still two feet of parchment,” Matt said dully.    “Shut up! I just know you’ll finish it in our next lesson,” Barnabas interjected. He was, of course, right. Matt hid a grin.   “I do wonder though... why he’s here and not Siva?” Cheryl asked thoughtfully.   Everyone else shrugged. Well, most of them. Wan Qing piped up, “Maybe Siva’s just sick!”   They all pondered over this for a while.   “You know, I think that may be the cleverest thing you’ve ever come up with,” Matt said.  ----------  “And they were all  laughing  at me – the idiots!” Minellus Molekiw complained to the girl beside him.   “It’s alright, it’s all over now,” she replied soothingly.    “I can’t get it out of my head! All this time I’m trying to be serious and all they do is laugh at me! I really want this job you know. I like Potions but I want to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts too,” he said childishly.   In her mind, she was cursing at him.  You’re supposed to be my boyfriend, you stupid old goat!  But instead she replied quietly, “Of course you do. And I’m sure the students will all come to accept you in time. Just like I have,” she added, smiling.   He looked into her hazel eyes, and felt all the worry dissipating.   “Of course they will,” he said dreamily.  Just like you have...   ----------  “WHAT?”  “It’s cancelled!” Hu Ping said smugly.   “Woohoo!” Yi Fan cheered.  “The Astronomy test is cancelled? But... but... I’ve already studied for it!” Matt wailed.    “Apparently Professor Huda has something on that evening,” Barnabas added in. “In fact, she says that we may be getting a relief teacher, because she may be going on leave soon,” he added.   “Really? D’you think it’s because we called her... well, you know...  Paddle Pop ?” Minyu asked. Professor Huda had one day worn a multi-coloured outfit to class and had been called by the name of the rather colourful ice-cream. She hadn’t seemed too pleased about it.   “Nah, I don’t think she has such a small temper,” Cheryl said. “Maybe it’s because we’ve been teasing her about Professor Helmi...”   Having seen the two teachers together at mealtimes, between and after lessons, the class had come to the conclusion that they were a pair. This rumour had spread like wildfire round the school and had culminated in Professor Huda giving them a talking-to during one Astronomy lesson.   “Oh my god,” Matt said suddenly from his corner, where he was working on his Defense Against the Dark Arts essay.   “What?” Eunice said.    “I think I know why she’s going on leave,” he said slowly.   “Well, I’ll never!” Muthu and Eunice said in unison. They had been rather affected by a group of old bimbos and had resorted to acting like them.    “She’s going on maternity leave!”  ----------  Dinner that evening was a noisy affair. Of course, with the mysterious disappearance of Professor Siva and the rumour of a pregnant Professor Huda, the students would be anything but quiet. Everywhere there were people shooting furtive glances at the staff table to check if Professor Huda was really donning a maternity dress. Cheryl rolled her eyes. Honestly. If a teacher wanted to get pregnant what did it have to do with the students?   This thought was going through her mind and she was just about to say it out loud to her friends when she bumped into that same Slithering girl from the previous evening.    Yee Tien shot a look of pure disgust at Cheryl and her friends. “So, it’s  you  again,” she said coolly. That girl beside her, Liqin, kept on nodding.   “What’s your problem?” the group said in unison. Most of them were returning the looks of disgust right back to Yee Tien.   “Well, the thing is that  I  am able to take points from Houses now,” she said smugly, holding up a large badge with the words “Molekiw’s Men” on it. The group stared.    “What does...  that  mean?” Muthu asked, puzzled.   “Basically it means that our dear Professor Molekiw wants to have helpers weed out people who break the rules,” she replied. “People like  you , basically,” she continued. “So that’ll be five points for the ankle socks... each,” she said, pointing to the girls, “another five because I don’t like you,” she jabbed a finger at Matt, “oh, and five each for the both of you who have your shirts tucked out,” she shouted to Rachel and Sunny who were coming up behind the fifth-years. She gave them all another superior look before turning on her heel and walking off. Liqin continued staring at them.   “ Liqin !”   She turned, and ran back to Yee Tien, her bimbo traits evident.   "What kind of name is  Molekiw's Men ?" Hu Ping asked.  "Sounds kinda sado-masochistic to me," Matt replied. The rest stared. He cringed.  “Well, I’m not sure I can guarantee I won’t secretly curse her,”he said crossly.    “You’d be doing us a favour,” Barnabas said shortly. “In fact I think she deserves a big slap!”   At that moment, Cheryl couldn’t have agreed more.
