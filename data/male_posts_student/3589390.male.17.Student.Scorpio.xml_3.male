It only took 35 minutes or so, but I was a bit warm and my hair was messed up pretty badly. Today I was supposed to train some kid from concession, but I only saw him for about 10 seconds and then he supposedly went home sick. Oh well. The evening went smoothly, even thought I'd get out of their pretty quickly...well I was wrong. While I was locking everything up, there was one lock that...just wouldn't lock. It took me 20 minutes to get it, and I'm still doubtful it was completely locked. I forgot something of mine I left in the fridge...er..what else, I had to run around like a madman for the last half hour, sweating my brains out, giving myself a horrible headache, just to get out at a reasonable time. AGh. I know I'm overreacting, but I'm allowed. Whatever.  I'm dead.
