Like, snow, covering the windshield type of crash.  It took the kindness of three people to wedge us out.  I guess that its fairly common to crash into snow, since while we were digging the car out, a woman crashed 100 meters from us, and I helped push her car out.    Other than that stuff, Jessie is in Denver (Eleanor's boyfriend) picking up their new car, since they gave me MINE.  YEP.  Eleanor is cooking with my dad and Derek is doing kung fu.  Derek and I played some Army Ops today, training is tough, but fun.  I hope theres no school tomorrow, either.
