Well, they say she has a shady past...how bout myself. Maybe the shady part is now, which will eventually be my shady past in the future.Sigh... Thanks Dustin, you're right, love is painful. Now come to think of it, why aren't I Iceman(Bobby). He's got a whole lot of trouble with love. Oh well, maybe it's just a totally different experience. Anyway, maybe true love is...1Corinthians 13. I really don't know. What is true love? How is it different from "love"? I still don't understand. What I do know, is that what God did for us is a model of perfect love. I thought it was a simple word...but now, it seems so hard to understand. But love is not all feelings. I can be certain about that. Today, I went to school(it's at 2 Siglap Link now), well, it's a really nice building. From the inside, it feels like some complicated city. Like those you see in Star Wars you know? Lots of bridges. But nice place. But quite easy to get dizzy trying to find your way. Guess I'll take some time to get used to it. I just slept the day away. Now I have to finish my Geography Workbook. And somtime before I slept, I was thinking bout some stuff. My past...well, not that long ago...just earlier this year. So many regretful things happened. I've only begun to see the worst of human life in the world...am I ready? I hope I am...things will never be the same again. My shady days begin...
