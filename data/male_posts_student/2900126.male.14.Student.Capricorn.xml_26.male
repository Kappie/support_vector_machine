I got two new books Charlie Bone and the Invisible Boy (the last book of the series) and The Amulet of Samarkand (the first book a trilogy). So yeah and I'm getting an Aqua Center pass so we (Chris and I) can swim whenever we want and Sonya told me that at her pool they can pay once for the whole year and they have an indoor pool. I have to go to get my physical tomorrow so I can go to high school and so I can play soccer/volleyball. I really want to learn how to play soccer and be on the soccer team, I think it would be so cool.   Oh my god, it's Mickey Mouse anniversary, I don't know which one, but it's his anniversary. I think  Mickey Mouse is sooo cool because I think all kids our age grew up with him as children and he was like one of the best characters. Mickey Mouse is like, I don't know. I think I might get a tattoo of him as my first tattoo because it would remind he of when I was an innocent child.
