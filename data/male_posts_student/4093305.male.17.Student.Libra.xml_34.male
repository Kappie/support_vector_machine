A Michael Moore bashing site posted a  urlLink bootleg of F 9/11 , and they're holding him to Michael Moore's word that he'd like his movie to be shared on the net. This is apparently what he thinks:  "I don’t agree with the copyright laws and I don’t have a problem with people downloading the movie and sharing it with people.  As long as they’re not doing it to make a profit, you know, as long as they’re not trying to make a profit off my labor.  I would oppose that."   So, if that's the case, let's all start downloading with  urlLink BitTorrent . Hurry up, we need more bandwith so more people can download the movie and enjoy it. Hahaha! ;)
