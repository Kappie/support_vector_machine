Some of my collages have watched this movie and said to me that there is nothing more realistic than this movie. Because of this I have decided to watch this movie. Unfortunately, I was only able to watch the first ten minutes of the movie because of some technical problems. I think the movie “Bend It like Beckham” is about an Indian girl who is a pro in football and has a dream to become a football super-star. Unfortunately her mom thinks playing football is not the life of her daughter. Bechman struggles and finds her way to become the best soccer player to date of England. I think Bechman will get into lots of trouble for playing football without her mom’s permission. All I know is that this is going to be a great movie.     So, why don’t we watch it?
