I really need to get the fact that the Canadians drive on the  other  side of the road into my head, but until then, crossing the road has the possiblity of turning me into road kill...      but since none of you care I suppose its not that big a deal...      *sigh* tis the 20th of July, which means I have still one more month here...      The boredom...      Meh...
