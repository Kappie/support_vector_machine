But the strange thing is that I still have this feeling in my stomach that isnt very comfortable. So I remember this one conversation from the movie Love Actually which I hope most of you have seen and Im not in love like the kid in the movie but I know where he is coming from.  Daniel: Liam Neeson as the dad who thinks his son has some really big problem coz he´s acting weird Sam: The son whos acting strange  Daniel: So what's the problem, Sammy-o? Maybe... school - are you being bullied? or is it, I don't know - something worse? Can you give me any clues at all?  Sam: You really want to know?  Daniel: I really want to know.  Sam: Even though you won't be able to do anything to help?  Daniel: Even if that's the case.  Sam: OK. The truth is... I'm in love.  Daniel: Sorry?  Sam: The truth is I'm in love and there's nothing I can do about it, and it just keeps getting worse.  Daniel: Aren't you a bit young to be in love?  Sam: No.  Daniel: Oh, OK, right. Well, I can't deny it. I'm a little relieved.  Sam: Why?  Daniel: Well, you know - I thought it might be something worse. Sam  [incredulous]  Sam: Worse then the total agony of being in love?  Daniel: Oh. Yeah, you're right. Total agony.   Úlli
