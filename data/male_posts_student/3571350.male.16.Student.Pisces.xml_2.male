And he's lying about that he's going to help his friend colin to install norton but he's actually smoking. WHY ME? Seriously. My life is now hell and my family is screwed up. Why me and why does it have to happen to me people? I don't know what to do right now. I'll maybe tell my parents tomorrow morning as they're sleeping right now and be pissed at me for waking them up. That's the big thing about my day. HELP
