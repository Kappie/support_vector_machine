For the past two weeks I don't think I've plunged more than two hours of playtime at most... I am not quitting, but somewhat lost interests...  It's about half way into my summer break, I haven't done anything really productive other than catching myself up with computer news. If my work hours would be a little better I might have more time to do my own stuff. Getting home every night right about or after 12AM is started to get on my nerves. Seems like I don't have enough time for anything, don't you ever felt like that?  I bought a very nice $130 chair yesterday. It's very comfortable and all, I like it a lot. Chair to geeks is like tires to a car. A bad chair can cost you pain and suffering a few hours into geeking; bad set of tires can cost you precious time on track.  Well, this is my first post! ^^
