This is how my life has been for the past 9 months, ever since I began working at Pets at Home.             Why're you posting this Blog now?             I'm posting this Blog before I go to bed, as tomorrow Iwillbe utterley bored and possibly stressed. However I've found a way to manage stress at work, its called kicking the fridge, fun little game, highly recommended! What you do is make sure there's no-one in the staffroom, walk in, go over to the fridge, swing your leg back, think of the person who's stressed you out and swing your leg forward! Oh the joys, it doesn't hurt, nothing gets damaged and you feel better, even though it is a bit sad :.             What is the biggest cause of Stress at work?               When I walk into the office and the manager gives me a till to cash up and I ask the question "Am I on the till all day?" and the reply is "Yes." Last week I actually pleaded with the manager for me to not go on the till but I got a "It's your job!" Yes it is my job, it's also the other 4 staff members job but it seems they enjoy picking on me...             How do you mean picking on you?               In my first few weeks at work I was made to clean out the aviaries (probably the most difficult and time consuming job there). A few weeks later the same manager made me tidy the entire cat litter. She left and now she's back and I seem to be either a) on the till or b) doing the crap jobs like smartening all the bulk (15kg+) dog food.             Don't you get a Sunday Dinner at all?               Oh I get a Sunday dinner, but warmed up Sunday dinner, compared to fresh, might as well be monkey droppings. Mum's Sunday dinner used to be one of my favourite meals, now it's just boring and tastless.             When will you be going to bed?               Very soon... In fact, I'm fed up of this interview.             Oh come on...               STFU!!! I'm going to bed.             Don't leave things like this James!               If I were you, I'd getshut upbefore you see my angry side...            JAMES LEAVES THE ROOM             ARSEHOLE!               JAMES ENTERS THE ROOM            What did you say?             Erm... Your feet smell like dasies...               Thanks!            JAMES LEAVES THE ROOM...
