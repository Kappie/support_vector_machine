HE was the one giving 30 minute talks about how he would prefer to teach our class rather than 410. he says that people stab him in the back, but he too does the same thing, talking shit about 410 behind their backs. like how the students there are stupid to believe that they can inherit their parents' companies and how they do not listen to him in class. my friend from 410 told me that he gives them primary 6 exam papers to do, and then writes the answers on the board for them. talk about gayness. and the biggest irony: he wasted 10 minutes talking about NOT wasting time. wow. to read more shits about him, visit   urlLink  ross_lee.blogspot.com   .      sad to say this, but from the 30 minutes spent on writing this, while listening to afi at the same time, it doesn't sound too good. hopefully it would grow into me...   anyway, i found out that blogger doesn't allow double spaces any more. wtf. that's why when you read my old posts, there would be double spaces after each full-stop. and i think it's easier to read with double spaces too. unfortunately, blogger is gaiz and don't allow it.   oh yes, i have 3 tests tomorrow. 1 additional maths, on matrices and shit and 2 history tests, on china and long march. bleah. how unfortunate.
