Besides homewor, I went up to Shelter Bay to celebrate my Mom and Uncle's birthdays.  They are actually three years and tow days apart.  I said they were two years and two days.  Maybe my Grandparents only had sex twice and according to my estimate that would be St. Patrick's Day.  My Grandma has always loved St. Patrick's Day.  Wonder if anyone but me has caught this.  I'll ask her today when I see her. lol  I had a great time.  My Uncle BBQ'd salmon.  It wasn't bad, but Mom and I don't care for fishy fish.  Skipper's is usually the only fish I like (some other resteraunts surprise me once in a while).  I saw baby red potatos and got excited thinking I could eat a few of those.  Oh no, they had to have spice on them that I hate (Rosemary).  I was polite and ate it anyway, but that doesn't mean I had to enjoy it.  Don't get me wrong, it was good for being what it was, they just aren't my thing.  At least there weren't mushrooms!!  I spent about four hours there before heading back south.  I was going to stop by my other Uncle's house to visit them and my other Grandma, but I forgot to turn on the street to get to their house and ended up on the freeway.  Had it not been on a stretch of highway where there is not exit for over five miles, I would have turned around.  Gas is too damned expensive.  I came home and chatted on-line and worked on homework, yet again.  The sad thing is, I'm still not close to being caught up.  I'm a perfectionist and these essays are killing me.  While I'm writing about one, I'm thinking the back of my head about the other.  I'm about to scream!  I went to bed early due to frustration and a feeling of hopelessness.  I'm just overwhelmed with having to move and get caught up right before finals.  I also have a final project I need to get busy on for a Batch File presentation.  There's just soooo much to do!  I registered for Summer Quarter in hopes of getting to go.  I also registered for one Fall Quarter class, but still need to figure out the other two.  Well, I better get back to more homework; I have class at noon and it's 10:17.  I'm sure I'll write more tonight as things unfold.  I'm going to Seattle to help Mom get a TV from Fred Meyer's to home.  She can't lift it and I don't want he trying.  Until the next entry, take care!
