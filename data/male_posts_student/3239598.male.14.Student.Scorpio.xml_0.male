Shouldn't they put some kind of username retrieval thing in that uses the password, since they APPARENTLY don't know how to send me an e-mail containing both my username and password.  So, anyway, the point is, I am back.  And, I STILL don't know what to write.  I'm very confused, with all you people, but I'm too annoyed right now to worry about being confused.  I do NOT want to read my freaking literature ending in front of my freaking class.  What kind of messed up idea is that, Mrs. Watts?  I HATE READING STUFF IN FRONT OF THE CLASS.  IT SUCKS!  Not to mention, I hate this computer.  It never. freaking. WORKS! It keeps telling me that on subprofile, my password is invalid.  Then, the next day I'll go in, put the same info in again, and it works.  Like magic... yeah, right!  DemoB is outside driving around in our go-kart.  I like our go-kart.  But, I crashed it, as many of you well know.  Right into a barbed-wire fence because it was slick.  A word of warning:  Do not attempt to make 90 degree turns next to a barbed-wire fence 20 minutes after it has rained.  Trust me, it DOES NOT WORK.  You SLIDE into the fence.  And cut your leg open.  And it hurts.  And, that is all I have to say.  Bye!  ~JACK SPARROW~
