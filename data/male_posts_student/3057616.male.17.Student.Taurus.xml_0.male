Then realized that I had Piano Lessons at 11:00 as replacement for next week because I was going to Desaru.... so I had a very rushy morning..  The piano lesson was like... err... kinda horrible.... because this was one of the few times that I actually went to my teacher's house to have lessons... her piano is so sensitive... i barely had to touch it to make a sound... so my controlling was already in disarray...   Then after that I rushed to Suntec because I told my fren I would go with him to his Youth service today... New Creation Church's Youth ministy is called TeenZeal.. and.. well... the service was pretty cool... Points to take note of 1) The keyboardist did not leave his seat while the preacher was talking (positive) 2) There were 3 backup singers, 1 backup lead and a worship leader, making the whole setting not only impressive, but it creates a professional scene (positive) 3) There were 3 people at the sound control panel, each controlling different parts of the setting (positive) 4) The paster had intercession with the music at the background still, the worship leader still singing - however with a lower volume [thanks to the sound control panel crew] (positice) 5) The guitarist coordinated with the keyboardist VERY well... (positive) 6) The drumset, being electric, was generally controlled by the sound control crew, and therefore, had no piercing effect and was very well controlled (positive)  a) The lead singer's voice was somewhat less resonented then the backup singer's voice (negetive) b) The 3 backup's constantly stumbled (as in unable to independently aid the worship leader while working as a team ), maybe because they relied on the worship leader too much... (negetive) c) The paster loses his seriousness in some aspects of his sermon as he cracks some un-related jokes (negetive) d) Properity teaching - as a whole, is a factor that sometimes can attract the wrong attention... We must know that God gives blessings, yes, and blessings abundantly... however... we must also realize that Christianity is not a bed of roses... God wants us to be prepared for terrible times....  After going to the TZT with cPazo aka Yuan Long, I went with my family out to eat at Crystal Jade Palace restaurant... my bro was not joking.... When he said we were going to eat at Crystal Jade... the first thing that came to my mind is Crystal Jade Kitchen... but when we reached Taka, instead of going down to the basement, we went up... I was shocked... so I thought it would be Crystal Jade Steamboat... but then... he didnt stop there..  Then... I nearly fainted when he stopped at Crystal Jade palace restaurant...  The meal cost over 300.... Knn...  Haha... kk.. sleepy le... tml got camp some more.. lolz... Got to sleep....  Mood: Happy, excited.... Optimistic...
