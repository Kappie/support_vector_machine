Continuing the barrage of demonic advertising that we are subjected to Esure decided to advertise by making a random (at least to me) old guy try and act and drive all those men and women crazy.  But, thankfully, he had those lucky words to say that saved him from his acting.  Oh lucky words...and it turns out it wasn't a commercial, it was a waste of time- I now have absolutely no idea who esure are.
