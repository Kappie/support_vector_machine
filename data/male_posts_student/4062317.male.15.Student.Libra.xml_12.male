That was one of the best games i have ever played it allowed the player to do almost anything they wanted.  You could be purely evil or a real goody-goody. The real fun of the game is taking the evil path and eventually becoming the Lord of the Sith. Any ways I am waiting for KotOR II which will be released this winter.  Now I just need to get into Doom 3 I havent played very much because i have been into KotOr. But now that I have beaten it I will try to beat Doom 3. Well the more I type the more game time I lose so see ya.  Lates,  Smog
