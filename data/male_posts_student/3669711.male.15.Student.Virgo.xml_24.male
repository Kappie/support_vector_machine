It downloads half of whatever you are watching before it starts playing, so no random buffer times. All good and nice. But what happens when you want to keep whatever you are watching. Well, an enterprizing frind and myself figured out a way to do so, but it's a government secret, so i can't tell you.     Well, anyways, i got a few movies and a music video that i like, and the movie that i watched yesterday was Aa! Megami Sama. Now begins my rant about it:    root@HarukaSoft root# emerge rantmode  root@HarukaSoft root# rantmode    Ok, well, first of all, the story. It took place 3 years after the original series, so Belldandy is living with Keiichi and Urd and Skuld. Everything was great. But when a prisoner on the moon was released, trouble started. Belldandy met her old mentor, Celistine, and he caused her to lose her memory, and transfer a virus to the network in heaven. Thats the base story, if you want to find out what happens, please get it and watch it yourself.     Now, on to my review. The animation first of all. Beautiful, thats all i can say. Very fluient, nice use of colour, detailed. It was some of the best anime i have ever seen. It is a high production quality movie. Now the voices. The version that i watched was dubbed, meaning it is in english. I was surprised at how good it sounded, and also surprised at how easy it was to follow. I'm used to subtitles in my anime, but this was actually really good. The music, it was only meh. It was good in some places, but when the singing happened, it just got odd. The overall score of this anime: 8.5/10    I didn't appreciate the sacreligious aspects of it, but over all it was a pretty good story. And it was romance too, so that was great for me. Well, it looks like i'll be watching Escaflowne: The Movie today! Hope thats just as good!    Lates
