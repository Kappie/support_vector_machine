No, he doesn't pee, poop or anything. Instead, he obsessively sniffs his way to the northwest corner of the deck and "plop!" he's off the deck, nose augured into the ground. He's on the scent.  Is it a rabbit?  Tasmanian devil? Who knows. But, I'm convinced that something wicked went under the deck, perished, and now the aroma of decay is tantilizing the puppy senses. It calls to him. He must go.  "Whine! whine! whine," went the doggie.  I look over the side of the deck and can follow his puppy trail along the perimeter: signs of digging, a double-paw-width, as he's tried to excavate a path to claim the tempting prize.  How incredibly gross. He's drooling as he looks up at me.  Tail wagging.  I look over at the tweeny-doxie who sits in a prized spot of sunshine on the deck, soaking up the rays. Completely oblivious. Or old.  "Whine."  Oops. That was me.  I think I need to go inside now.
