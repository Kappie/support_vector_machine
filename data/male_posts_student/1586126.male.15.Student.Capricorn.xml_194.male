Article:   urlLink  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3549408.stm                This article is about the rise of oil prices in the world setting a new record in history. This is caused by the menace Iraqi militant cleric Moqtada Sadr set after rejecting calls to end the fighting. This implies that Mr. Sadr may sabotage refineries and pipelines in Iraq since Sadr followers had taken over the cities of Basra, where 90% of Iraq’s oil exports go through. Iraqis officials shut down the plants to avoid a possible attempt of a terrorist attack. This reaction caused the rise in prices. In the article also talks about the impact Yukos may have with this. Analysts say it will take about six weeks for the effects to come.             It is pretty obvious that this is a great problem the world is undergoing. The simple fact that oil has made a new record in prices alarms everyone. If oil prices are high, then, considering that much of world’s oil comes from the Middle East, countries around the world will suffer its effects. Another problem within the subject is the effect it may cause to Yukos, which is one of the world’s biggest oil companies, since if it haves a big impact on Yukos economy, then prices will go even higher aggravating the problems.
