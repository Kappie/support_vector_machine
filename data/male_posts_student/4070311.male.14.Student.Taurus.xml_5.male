Anyway .... after the national celebration hor.... i went back to my oLd sKoOl .... ReD sWaStiKa SkOol wif Heng, Xin wei, Donavan, Han Fei and cHubBy .... we mEt up wif quite a lot of teachers.... but all the teachers seemed to hav forgotten us. bOo! hahax .... After visiting and stuff like that, Yiheng, chubby and I went to fEnGshAn CC and have lunch.... afTer lunch, chubby and I went to the playground and chat about things that happened recently while Yi heng went to play sOccer .... After chatting for about 1 hour, chubby wanted to come to mah house. so he came lor. Den hor.... we tok tok and tok. Den, he went to see my hamsters. After seeing and playing wif them for awhile, one of my hamsters died ! that hamster was from a friend of my mom. She gave it to her recently only.... and after 1 or 2 months, it died! anyway .... had oikos at night. Very little people came. But, its alright. Cuz, in God's eyes, He doesn't see by the number of people that is around us, beside us, or wherever they may be. But, by the faith that we have in him. bLeAhx .... btw hor .... i can't realli use the computer these few days. Because of the nearing common test. So, if i can;t update my blog, realli SORRY! alright. Stop here for today. Take care and God bless u.   *Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.   [Matthew 17:20]
