Here is my test   urlLink    This is one of the many guitars that I want!  However...after further testing, I think that the pictures that you want to put online have to be in the jpg format... That kinda sucks.  urlLink Zach  if you find out if they dont have to be in this form, please contact me.  And one more thing, how can I view all of the pictures in my database that I upload? This is actually kind of confusing. I'd almost rather use  urlLink PhotoBucket.com
