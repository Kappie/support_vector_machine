So I sat alone outside between E and D halls. It was soooo pretty! The wind was blowing and it just felt so .. . . . incredible. *sigh*... It was one of those times that was so great that you know you could have only enjoyed it on your own.   Today was pretty awesome too. We started CAT6 testing. I love this time of year! It gives me time to catch up on my sleep. I just turned on my CD player and drifted away. I woke up with drool on my arm... but I didn't care cus it felt so great. I got to march the company too. Im prety sure I did great.   Now all I gots left to do is homework, study, and uhh .... ill think of other stuff too.
