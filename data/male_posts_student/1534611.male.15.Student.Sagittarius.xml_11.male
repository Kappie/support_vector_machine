Which was suprisingly fun, and I got in shape and saw abs, and already My abs are gone! *tear*. I'm seriously contimplating excersizing more, everyday do sets of sit ups and push ups and maybe go for a jog (But seriously, who the fuck with long curly hair goes for a jog?)   Also, VERY excited for warped tour! :D coheed and cambria, Thursday, woo! if they end up playing at the same time I'll be mad, maybe I'll end up cutting myself in half and going to both stages. Warped tour will be tons of fun, I just know it! Even though I am disapointed at the fact Brand New, taking back sunday and the starting line aren't playing, but as long as I see coheed I will be happy! Maybe I'll even see that really cute girl I met at the last show, haha man i'm excited :D   Heh I never thought I'd post in my blog ever again, but Mecha_Yoshi from CG reminded me of the blog and HEY why not! I mean, it's 3:30 am, what else do I have to do?   Gonna go open up another can of apple juice, can't get enough.
