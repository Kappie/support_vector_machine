The focus of my apologetic will emphasize the seriousness of sin as an infinite separator humans put between themselves and God and on God's character of justice.  I plan on discussing other issues like free choice, God's love, and the fact that hell is not a place of physical torture as an unskilled reader of Dante may think.  I'll post another blog to announce the completion of this work.  Any insights from my readers is welcome.
