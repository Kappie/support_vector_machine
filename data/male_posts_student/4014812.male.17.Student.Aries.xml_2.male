Fill in the blanks on these stupid question things... i received about 3 of them today... totaling over like 400 questions... and they are all the same!!! ahhhhhhhhhhh.... and according to James, im going to marry Geroge W. Bush... and that im  Slutty.... lol... news to me!    LOL... besides all the questions things it was a fairly borng day... I didnt do anything at all. Just kinda sat around all day and chatted to the very limited amount of people that actually talked to me.    I also cleaned up my contact list a bit... I deleted all the people that dont talk to me... or that do talk to me... just never... and when i try to talk to them they just kinda run away... (audra)... but i didnt delete her... cuz i wouldnt do such a thing... but yeah... i deleted just useless people from my list cuz they are boring and they dont deserve to be on my list anymore :D    Anyway... my parents are still going away this weekend and im looking for something todo... so if anyone wants to do somethign this weekend just ask me or something and we can get something organized or something and we can hang out:D    OH YEAH... im eatting a fudgesicle... hmmmmmmm
