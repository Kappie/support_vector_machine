This week, in my mind, has been one of the worst weeks of the year 2002.  I say that because my memory is bad at times.  It's really hard to express in words how things went this week without using many curse words.  I thank everyone who talked to me about it.  I appreciate it.  At this point, I honestly can't think so I'm going to go.  Perhaps I'll update tomorrow after I get some sleep.
