Well, as stated above, this blog's purpose is to present my thoughts, opinions, and journals to the world. Well I'm gonna have to put the ball in your court. I need topics to discuss. Maybe it's just the mood I'm in, but I can't think of anything worthwhile to give my thoughts or opinions on. Journals on the other hand are pretty easy. I could call this right here a journal and that would be fine. In fact I'm going to go title this "Journal" right now. That was easy. Anyway, I need your help. I hereby proclaim that upon reading this journal, you are personally obligated to  urlLink email me  with a topic that you would like to see me comment on/give thought to/formulate an opinion about. I thank you in advance for contributing to this blog. I hope to hear from you soon!
