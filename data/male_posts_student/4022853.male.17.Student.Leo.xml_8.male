Just when things get better they get a whole lot worse.  I must free my mind from this burden.  I dont want it anymore.  Its over now.  I must keep reminding myself thats its over now.  I dont have to fight it anymore.  I had to lose to win.  I just hope twisting in my stomach subsides really soon.  I do not know how long I can endure this pain for.  Good riddens!  So much pain for such little happiness.  Not worth it.....women.  My insides do feel better now.
