S is for the suit that cost me way too much to buy U is for the underwear that, trust me, matches the suit M is for the mutual fund I could invest in after a summer's earnings M is for the mailed tuition bill that reminds me the mutual fund thing won't be happening E is for the estate tax; just some advance planning R is for the resume that has no typos.  Except the one I haven't found yet.  A is for the answers to the interview questions that you ask me S is for the shoes that match the suit S is for the socks that match the shoes that match the suit O is for the organizations I joined just to impress you C is for the cufflinks I couldn't afford to buy to match the suit I is for the interview itself A is for the ascot.  I don't know what an ascot is. T is for the tie that matches the socks that match the shoes that match the suit E is for the elevator that got stuck on the way to the interview and made me miss it.  Oops.
