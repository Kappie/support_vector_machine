While I don't share Gibson's faith, I admire his commitment to making the film in the face of the controversy.  He's displayed a remarkable level of fortitude.  In the tradition of taking a shot at studio execs whenever possible -   'Making a "Passion" prediction is more difficult because there is not a similar pic --- a subtitled religious pic --- to which execs can compare it.'  I can see them trying to explain it to your typical studio executive.  "This Jesus character is a Neo-like figure."
