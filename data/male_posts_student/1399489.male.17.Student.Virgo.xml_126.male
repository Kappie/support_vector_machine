You know who you are! i have felt extremely lonley latley and its not fun! well with that said, life has been goin fairly well latley.  Definately not as fun as cruise time but still pretty good! yesterday my day/night was consumed by a 9 hr poker game, i had a net profit of $4.50 yay! lol about 50 cents a hour.  at least i didnt loose it all or play for 16 hrs like some ppl.  so yeah i only got 2 hrs of sleep and then went and picked blueberries with my neices this morn! i was tired but the berries sure do taste good (5 gallons of them!, anybody want some just tell me) then i got a nice 3.5 hr nap. tried callin somebody but they wernt there :( and then i went to church.  i talked to bryndan and he is commin back in town tomorrow and we are gonna have a wonderful 4th of july!!! fireworks and drinks! haha should be fun/interesting/dangerous!! my kinda deal.  ok this turned out really long so im gonna go spend the night at my sisters and try to fix a friends computer!  peace
