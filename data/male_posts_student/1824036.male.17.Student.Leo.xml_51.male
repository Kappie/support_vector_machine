So Travis just turned 16 and we (Travis, Mitchell, Justin, and I) were going to take "Ed" (this big huge boat of a Mercury Marquis that he has) and take it for a spin to Fort Dodge to a pizzeria there and tool around town. Somehow though we got it decided that we would take my car instead (more on that later). So we go for pizza and stuff, and it was good. We then went to Target and looked around for stuff with "no dice". Justin bought two movies. I cant remember which ones.  Then we decided to go over to Wal-Mart. There we walked all over the place and were trying to find some cheap and really really obnoxious things to buy. We ended up looking for fish with Justin. He decided that he was going to buy about 20 goldfish, a small bowl, some fish food, and some little rocks for the bottom of the bowl. We were waiting and waiting for service for about 10 minutes. Then someone finally came and talked to us. But then they left to "go get water". They never returned. We ended up waiting another 25-30 minutes for the stupid lady...but no luck with that. I then whipped over to the camera section and bought a disposable camera for no apparent reason. Then Travis decided to get a pack of some cheep genaric brand...uh...nevermind.  We get to my house at 8:08 and then we switch cars (I said I'd be back by 8). We get into Ed. And me, Taz (Travis), and Mitchell, decide to cruise the town for a few minutes. I get home at 8:45ish and my mom goes nuts on me. She wants to know why we took my car and not Ed. And then she wants to know why my car was here but I wasn't. Then she also wants to know why I wasn't home by 8. COME ON I WAS EIGHT MINUTES LATE!!! But whatever. It was a day well spent! I had a blast!!!  (There are many things that I did not mention due to the fact that if anyone that really cared about my safety read they would probably tell my mom, or some other authority figure in any young teens' life)
