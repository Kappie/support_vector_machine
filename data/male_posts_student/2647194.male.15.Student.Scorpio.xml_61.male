No recap is needed, other than that I got ahead in my math (this time I've got one of those electric hand-carts (well, maybe not) and I'm ahead of the math train). Also we watched "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street", the Twilight Zone.  Hmm...what should I feature tonight...how about what the heck is on the walls/ceiling of my room? Its actually quite interesting:  I currently have ::counts:: 7 constellations on my walls and ceiling: Cassiopea, Orion, Big Dipper, Little Dipper, Leo, some giraffe-type thing, and Scorpio, which is my astronomical sign, right above my bed on the ceiling.  Posters: Some car posters, including a Plymoth Prowler, MINI Cooper (hehehe), Lamborghini Diablo, "Corvette Evolution", a black Lamborghini, and "Muscle Cars from the 60's". Two Baseball Pennants, The Yankees (yeah, I used to be a fan...) and of course, The TWINS. Some other posters, including The Matrix Reloaded movie poster, 3 weather/lightning scenes. Oh-btw...the MINI's above my headboard. lol.  K, enough about my room, because its not all that interesting, other than that I have a couch.  Why I'm looking forward to the weekend: 1. Friday night I'll be, well, I don't know what I'll be doing. Hopefully not stuck at home. 2. Shouldn't be a whole lot of homework, other than English....die english. 3. Saturday night I'm going to a chops concert!!!! Should be a ton of fun. Ya'll should go-its at Highland Park High, concert starts at 6. Fee is 5 dollars. Order by phone. CRAP!!! I haven't ordered mine yet!!! uh oh 4. Um, the rest I don't know what the heck I'm looking forward to.  Why I want next week to come: 1. I get Monday off. 2. Tuesday, there's the Spring Concert at MSA. Show starts at 7:00. I'm doing something a little different with my suit this time too... 3. Wednesday, there's the MCTC RANDOM concert, which promises to be pretty fun. Show starts at 7:30. 4. Thursday: I don't know 5. Friday: what's not to love about Fridays??  Ok, so I screwed up on the MOA concert date. Its the 30th, not the 23rd. Same night as the lock-in at MSA. MOA to MSA. lol. EVERYONE NEEDS TO COME TO BOTH OF THOSE. THAT'S AN ORDER!  I really wish I didn't have to go to choir tommorow. ugh. I don't like choir much-our songs are kinda crappy. Therefore, if I don't do something fun tommorow night (playing starcraft in my room at 9:00 PM doesn't constitute as "fun" on a Friday night-sorry Derrick), tommorow will be a Friday that doesn't deserve to be named Friday.  Eh, thats enough for today. I need to go-my time is up for tonight, and I need sleep. DESPERATELY. If I don't start getting 8 hours a night again soon I'm going to die.
