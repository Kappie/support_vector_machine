DTs are diagnostic tests btw, it sounds like some cute little test to see whether you qualify for the post for research scientist in SETI (those guys who search for green little aliens). But anyway, its not, all you get is what some test which almost every other 16 year old in the Singaporean mainstream education sit for. So if you thought I'll be off dissecting aliens.......uhhh no.  Yea, english was about trees. Just one word "trees" and its like what the heck ! I wrote a huge bunch and just rambled on and on and on, i think i hit more than 500 words man, and I finished it in just 25 minutes. I talked about conservation environmental and how science should be the future if we wanna go green. And conservation should not be a long term solution. English is looking good.   Combined humans i can say I did not study at all, just read through it. But SS was very very easy, expecting quite abit and geog was kinda hard, but just crapped my way out. I think should be able to pass but alot of people just left the part about sustainable development which is 15/25 marks blank, so I think geog is overall very hard for all. And maths today was really easy as well, did not study but quite confident, left almost all the locus question blank tho, which means maybe 4-5/60 marks gone but quite confident about the rest.....  Yea, and I had a wierd dream last night. Actually its those dreams where I woke up at 5:30 am then slept again cos' I gotta wake up at only 6:30. Then ok I slept I dreamt of really alot of shit. I dreamt that my phone when I opened it I've got alot of cakes to choose from, i dunnoe how the heck can those cakes fit into my phone, but trust me, it can, but anyway, I was dreaming so it won't make much sense.  But the best part was I dreamt about a song! It was a song like not written anywhere else, its like.......wonderful almost from God, inspiration. I was listening to Shin Yue tuan before I slept and the song I heard was in the style of more Lisa Loeb kinda pop, with acoustic guitars and all, so it has no relation whatsoever to the music I have heard. Ok, so i shall tell you how the dream went. We were talking about relationship problems though.  It was like a counselling session, there was this woman 20+ she was like hurt and all, I dunnoe how did she end up there, and of course we were eating cakes from my phone, ok.....now its getting wierd, but hang in there. So she got really emotional and started singing a song, and it was like I could remember the title very vividly. It is called "There'll be only kings".  The rationale is like, sometimes, people will be king over our hearts in love, they rule us and at the same time for some people, they can have a king in their hearts but they are kings themselves in other people's hearts. But as for some very unfortunate people, they cannot be kings, and for some, they don't have a king. The ideal situation is of course, you own that person's heart and that person do. The line would be "someday.....there'll be only kings". It actually signifies a world of perfect love.   I'll get started on it soon........as in finish writing the whole song.
