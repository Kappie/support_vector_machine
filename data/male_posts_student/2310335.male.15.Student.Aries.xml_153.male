They have four events (highly convenient):    Computer Symposium (basically, speaking on a topic)  Quiz  Gaming  Web Designing    Events are taking place starting at 9.30 am and ending at 2.30 pm. One day only, again highly convenient. My calendar tells me that 28 th  is a Wednesday.   urlLink Download the  Details of Computer Symposium  here   urlLink Download the  Details of Quiz, Gaming, Web Designing  here   urlLink Download the  Schedule  here   Since they don't have a website, I've had to scan the letter they sent us. If the files that I've posted aren't readable for some reason, leave a note in the comments, I shall clarify doubts. One highly noticeable omission from this event is that of any programming event. I shall say no more. There are more eyes on this log than I'm comfortable with.  Those who wish to participate, please leave a note in the comments (with email address).  Have a good day and best of luck with the exams, --Karan  PS: They've given a contact name and number for clarifications: Mrs. Simmi Kher Ph: 25814084 Email:  urlLink springdalespusa@vsnl.com
