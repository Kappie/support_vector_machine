I would never be the one  You see when you close your eyes, Nor the girl you would ever pause To look at and say to yourself,  "God!  She is so beautiful!" I'd never be the person You'd pick up your pencil  And write love notes to Or send flowers on Valentine's Day. Because to you, I am a perfect stranger. But, what you are to me, you'll never know. You make up who I am. When I see you walking past me, I would pause and smell the scent You carry with you in the air? The scent that takes over my body And swallows up my soul. I always secretly look into your eyes And hope for the day when I will see my own reflection in them. When I pick up my pencil, I always end up finding myself Writing love poems about you? Poems I would never have  The courage to walk up to you And place them in your hands. Unlike all the other girls, I only see you once a day, Sometimes even not at all. So, for every time I find myself Anywhere near you, I am thankful for that moment. *Sigh* ...but why does it matter? Because, after all, I am still A perfect stranger.  ---Dream  I lie awake, alone in my bed,  awaiting your gentle touch,  Thinking of all I should have said,  'Cause to me you mean so much.  If this be a dream, let me never wake,  For my heart you have stolen, and my breath you do take.
