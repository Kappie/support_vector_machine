ACJC! haha... yeah anyway, simply love sports... especially... yup you guessed it! BASKETBALL! haha... indeed i am just a mere 166cm (damn short lah! crap!), but... i still strive to do my best... so... now... i even have my own team! it's called, 'Ling Li'...  anyway... am now in the ARTS faculty! it's fabulous here at the school... though, of course, presently it's the exam period... so... STRESS!!! haha... but honestly, i hardly study... so... nothing much lah... haha...  hmm... well... i am just blabbering right now... so... just moving away from the intros...  die lah! i am down with so many injuries! back, ankle and my shooting hand is now... grr... all injured! my middle finger has been like 'jammed' for the darn long time lah! haiz... and my back... it only hurts if i really overexert myself lah... but... it HURTS! damn it... but... nevertheless, i still must strive and work on!  haha... besides that, school is merely exams right now... and... well... the just over hols... were simply not hols lah... they suck lah... CCAs, studies, etc... i mean... it's so unlike Sec school... but... haiz... i made my choice, so i've got to live with it! haha...  ok... anyway... my personal life... not much is happening lah... regarding Kelly and all that... let's just give it a break lah... i mean... i seriously have no idea how she really feels about me... and... i might give up... but wo bu gan xing... really have feelings for her... but... what's the point at times when the person you like... is unsure... or... not so responsive? anyway... i just have to say that... Meiyi, is still in my mind i guess... not that, i intended it to be... but... it was Kelly that helped me forget about Meiyi, or somewhat... but now... with Kelly being so... tentative in my feelings... Meiyi is still... hmm... important in my life lah... but... let's not dwell on it... though i can say that, in reality, the person whom i hope can work out with is still Kelly lah...  well... hope i can study hard leh... the rest... will say in future... so... for now... Live Life To The Fullest! and being optimistic! ;p
