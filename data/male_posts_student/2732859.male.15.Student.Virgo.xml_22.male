It's good that Kerry has been rather quiet over the past couple weeks as this prisoner abuse thing has erupted.  They say not to interfere with your opponent while they are self- destructing.  The war will definitely be the issue of this election.  As long as Kerry doesn't say anything, the Repubicans like Sean Hannity and Rush can't accuse him of turning this into a political issue, which I believe he should be able to do anyway because Bush is the President and the Buck stops at the Oval Office desk.  Okay, I'll talk to you soon.
