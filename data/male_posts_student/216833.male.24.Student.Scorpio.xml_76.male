Do you remember it at all? I just remember parts of the show freaking me out. My dad used to watch it alot, I remember going up to his office and he had a TV in there. I guess late at night, TV episodes of V is pretty entertaining.   I bought the dvd.  It's fucking weird, but I totally got into the story. I didn't watch a whole lot of it - just as the aliens were intigrating themselves with the human society. What a trip man, this shit was humorous a few times. The 80's are funny on their own.
