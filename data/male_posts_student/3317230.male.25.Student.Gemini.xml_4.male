We have to leave our shoes out in the hall here, but the hallway is not really outside, but the front door is more like a gate.. So I'm going out to buy some fishcake and pocky, i put one shoe on, fine, i reach my foot over to the other shoe, tap it a bit to starighten it for optimal foot penetration, and a freakin lizard scurries out! I shrieked like a girl.. Like Ned Flanders..  So besides that, you may be wondering why I haven't posted in a while. Well, I had just cleaned Chris's computer up, erased everything, reinstalled windows, found 14 viruses and 400 adawre objects (i don't understand why either), erased everything again, reinstalled, and made it all fresh and tasty... Well she got another virus and i spent all day cleaning it again.. AVG didn't find the virus (yeah, i know, AVG sucks monkey balls), McAffee didn't find it, finally Norton found it.. Anyways, I'll save to gory details for people who care (Rob, that means you). So we're back online now, torrents galore...  Chris's mum (Auntie) taught me how to cook a fish today, i was pleased, i had questions, she couldn't answer them of course, since my cantonese is less than terrible, but my chinese writing ain't so bad, so i got the jist of it. I'm pretty pleased about this since I'll have to cook in a few months when I move into The Sweet Jesus... I need a wok.. So Mom, if you're listening, I'd like a wok with a lid for my birthday, along with other cooking things, maybe we can go shopping in chinatown when i'm back for a few days. I'll need a Pocky fix anyways...  The food here is most definitely not what you get in Ottawa at chinese restraunts, and completely not what you get at "The Hong Kong Kitchen" in Sackville. I got a fish soup the other day at a Shanghainese restraunt, very spicy with big chunks of fish in it, it was awesome..  I watched "Blow" the other day, it kinda blew (ha). It was great for the first half, then it got all sad and the guys life turns to shit.. Sorry to ruin the ending, but if you want to enjoy the movie, stop watching it at the point where he has a baby.  Alright, 4:14am, time for sleep.
