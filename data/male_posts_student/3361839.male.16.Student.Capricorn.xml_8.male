When ever I come back from a trip to Mexico or somewhere around there I miss a number of things, but by far the one thing I miss the most is how the air has a seemingly drenched taste.  A taste that one can only experience to understand it.  The taste of the water mixing with any number of things.  I would like to think that it might also have a hint of tequila in there ;)  Iggy :)
