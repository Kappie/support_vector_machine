My Dad just looked at my Jimi Hendrix Experience - Electric Ladyland CD, then gave me a very funny look and said: "With your hair are you trying to imitate someone?" Well, naturally I was quite chuffed that he compared my hair to Hendrix's (although from him it was quite a derogatory comment,being thebloodthirsty Neo-Con that he is,but all the same), but he keeps on telling me to have a haircut, and being the bloodthirsty Neo-Con that he is (did Imention that he was bloodthirsty, draconian, Bush-votingNeoCon?) that means I'm probably going to get a shave.
