You do not know who is against whom? or who has what  policies. Thats the reason why people are getting disenchanted with the politics.  Anyway spent the whole of day sleeping ......... after spending yesterday's night finishing "Call of Duty", this was expected. I am expecting the courier from Navendu with new games tommorrow .... will help in spending time further.     thats all for today .... will again post tommorrow   Mihir
