My mind paints this colorful pictures and makes me happy. I'm happy to think about that. These "pictures" and beliefs are different to each other. But they got one thing in common: they're all about being together with this special person. Life could be so wonderful if i would do a step towards this person. But I'm scared.  I'm scared because when i think too much about this person I'm starting to destroy this pictures. Splashes of black ink all over the colorful pictures and some little holes in the canvas are getting bigger and bigger. And then I don't want to make the step trying out how life could be with this person. I make a big step back and say to me that i don't like it.  Why?  I want to know why I'm doing this. It destroys everything. But hey.. there is nothing. Nothing it can destroy. But I should start making something. Making a step and have a look how life would be. Mhh....  PS: Seems like this was a pseudo-intellectual post. Hm. But i thought about that last night and felt I need to write my thoughts down. Wherever it's possible.
