I guess it just depends on how much Elissa keeps being annoyed by everything I do.  I think that will fade.  I still have friends to hang out with.  Kelly, Erin and Lisa have been good company away from the apartment.  Overall, I'm doing really well for being out of a 3 year relationship.  I'm pretty much recovered, didn't do anything really stupid... time to move on.  One more year of school.  Then I will have a job, much less free time, much more money.  I hope I can stay in town and work.  At least to keep some of my friends and the life I've built.  I fear working people.  As I get older it seems the people I meet are more and more dead.  Death approaches quicker than we believe.  It begins to take root in the teens as people learn to act on more than emotions.  Tonight while dropping Kelly off we kinda made faces at and then talked to some girl in the car next to us.  It was fun and exciting.  More people should interact in random places.  Always blows me away how reclusive we are.  Me included.  Anyway, just wanted to say things aren't bad.  Right now the thing I most dread is school starting next week.  That makes this a very normal time in my life.  Thanks to all my friends (probably anyone reading this) for helping me through.
