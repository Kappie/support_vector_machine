President Bush on Wednesday challenged militants who have been killing and injuring U.S. forces in Iraq, saying "bring them on" because American forces were tough enough to deal with their attacks.  I'm not qualified to second-guess the troops since I've never been in combat myself, but I have to wonder if maybe "bring it on" is better said by someone who is actually on the ground doing the fighting?  It seems to me that they have been bringing it on and, yes, they usually get pounded hard as a result, but only after US forces are hurt or killed.  Be careful out there. There's a war on.
