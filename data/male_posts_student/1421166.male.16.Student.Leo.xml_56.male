Now I know, I wanted to go Australia, cause I wanted to leave this place and shut myself from the world. Sometimes people are scary. Man always disappoint, except that I'm one. But it's scary how they (or we) always fail. It seems perfect for a world with only God and my shadow. But is it right to be in solitude? I guess lives like that. I believe every person lives with a dual personality, and everyone has a totally different life hidden from the world. And I know I'm like that. But sometimes I don't realise that I'm like that. I get so lost in everything false, it's like I don't know who am I...but who cares? My life is me and the other me. That's what it means to me. I want God to come in, if not all these woud seem meaningless. But it's difficult, I'm still lost in my own world. I just get so distracted by myself...sigh...
