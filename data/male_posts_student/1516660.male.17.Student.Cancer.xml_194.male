No, it's not chai tao kueh if you asked. It's the carrot caske in blocks. HaHa!   At 10, I read the newspaper out of boredom. And I saw this Court sale. Woah! $5 for a portable radio! YaY! I finally can get a small radio, for a cheap price too! I called WQ to come over accompany me. Later I accompany him lor to wait for his friend Alan. Meow meow!  By the time I got there, the queue was very very long! Snaking from Courts right up to the place where Evergreen bokshop is. Oh my! I got worried le. Because that radio is only available for 50 customers. Seeing such long queues gave me no hope le. But I queued anyway. WQ came later. He keep telling me to stop queueing, because there's no hope. I told him I won't give up. Then, at 11.06, I started having doubts. We only moved 10ms or so. Sigh. I think my radio sold out le. Then, I broke away from the queue! I gave up! So embarrassing you know! Everyone staring at me!!!   WQ and I went to wait outside the library. We plonked down on the floor and started talking. Talking about wu liao things like SL la, Kim Hock la....blah blah blah. XC smsed me, I message back. Woah! Wasted so many messages. Meow!   At 12, the library opened its big doors. And everybody rushed in man! Woah! Like wild animals stampeding. Seriously. Got noise (Chong!!) some more. I think the lbirarians are mortified. I quickly rushed up to get a table for us.   At the library, I borrowed Chicken Soup For The Teenage Souls III. It's back for more heat-warming stories! I love Chicken Soup! Between 12.30 to 1.45, whatI did was read the book, chatted with WQ and helped him with some Intergration problems. At 1.45, Alan came (He looked quite good ma....dunnoe why WQ said he's not good-looking! HaHa!) and I left for Wendy's house.  When I came in, Wendy was frying eggs. Meow meow! Later, somehow, I got her to cook Maggie for me (I didn't have lunch ma). Felt kinda guilty, but.....sigh! After that, we ate noodles and eggs while watching Final Fantasy the movie. So exciting that movie! I loved it you know. So touching, the story. Neal died, and the woman gave up shooting and died along with him. I think she likes him. Then, another guy died. In the end, Gray sacrifice himself to spread the "cure". So touching! So brave! The ending's kinda sad, but beautiful. Sunshine and warmth return to the Earth again. Ahh......  I managed to complete my EL homework while watching the movie. After watching the touching movie, both of us played Chocobo Racing. We kept beign disruptyed by Wendy's mother walking here and there. HaHa. She's fixing the curtains. We play 2 rounds, I think. The last one we are tied and have to play the tie-breaker game. I won I won! Meow!  Okay. Coming back home, I immediately switched on the computer. YaY! So many things updated. New virus software, new scanner and a new CD-RW drive! So many meowing things! After that, I bathed and ate dinner while watching 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Daughter and Simpsons.   Then, I came online. I used 2 discs to write my Charmed vids. Meow!! Then, I chatted with XC, WQ and Wendy. Then somehow, in oue chat, Wendy and I started to duet using poems. HaHaHa! So funny!  Alright. I shall present you our poem!     Duet    Head spinning as words of your letter flow out,   Go take a rest, I gently shout.   No thanks, I have work to do, for graduation draws nearer and I have work unfinished,   I warn cautiously: Your headache's not going to be diminished.   I will, for I'll take a rest after I finish one last letter, address to the person whose name I fear of hearing,   Oh my! That's terrible for your well-being!   Though this is terrible, I have no choice, I can hardly fall asleep with work undone,   Doing work like this won't be fun.   It will, with a positive attitude, with a motive in mind,   If you say so, with this I am fine.   Thanks my friend, for showing your concern to a sick being like me,   You are welcome, very blessed be.   So what are you doing now, my friend? What's occupying the friend of mine currently?   Oh, just blogging and chatting and the dilly-dallies.   Then it's time for me to take my leave, for I wouldn't want to distract you in whatever you are doing,   Nonsensical ramblings you give, so I return to my busying.    Fine, my concern for you falls on deaf ears. I'll leave you alone as you wish,   Would you like a fish?   HaHa! I love it! I hope we cna do more of this in the future! Alirght. Time for me to go. See ya tomorrow. Goodnight blog!
