For those of you who don't know, it's some magazine that tells women stuff about life, sex, and, most importantly, the nature of men.  One article was particularly stupid. It talked about annoying things men do and why they do them so much. For example, men channel surf because they want dominance and control of their lives, and channel surfing helps fulfill that desire.  Did it ever occur to you that men channel surf because they're looking for something good on television? I mean, sure a TV Guide tells you what's on, but it won't say how much you like it. Besides, it's not like women don't channel surf as well.  I swear, there are just some things on this planet that just don't need analysis.
