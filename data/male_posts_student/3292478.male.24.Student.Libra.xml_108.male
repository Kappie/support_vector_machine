A very clever Flash application!  In its own words it-  'presents the 86,800 most frequently used English words, ranked in order of commonality. Each word is scaled to reflect its frequency relative to the words that precede and follow it, giving a visual barometer of relevance. The larger the word, the more we use it. The smaller the word, the more uncommon it is.'   A few of my favourites-   plinth  #23108  mellifluous  #62851  panoply  #42958  misanthropic  #77633  laburnum  #45345
