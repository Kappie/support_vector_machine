I sign in, and lo  behold, everything's changed. Interesting. I should probably come here more often.  The second thing I notice is a "would you like to try gmail?" link.  I think I would, thankyouverymuch for asking.  So now, I am the proud holder of a  urlLink Gmail  account. Fucking brilliant. The service seems to be fan-fucking-tastic, it's just a damn shame that nobody ever  urlLink emails me . Well I guess it's not, really, as it cuts down on the amount of spam I get.  Speaking of spam, some fucker has got my @ urlLink slowdive.net  account in thei address book or something, and I keep getting  urlLink netsky  (or similar)-infected emails. I don't know who they are, but when I find them, I'm going to impound their computer as punishment for their stupidity.  So I got a job. Yes, that's right, a Job. I bet you thought you'd never hear me utter those words, but there we go. I'm now a bike courier. That means I get paid to ride around the city all day in shorts  t-shirt, getting fit. I could do with more than just the one day a week of it though. $15/hr is OK pay, but even two days a week would make my life a lot easier. After just two days on the job, my bike died. I popped a spoke on the drive side of the rear wheel, and it cost $135 to fix up - a new wheel, plus a service. Three days later, I bought a new bike. Hopefully this one will last as long as the old one did.  My good friend  urlLink Neal Holmes  and I are planning to ride to Melbourne sometime later this year, or early next year. That should be fun... I certainly hope he's serious about it, as I'm really looking forward to it.  Speaking of Melbourne, I recently entered Valentine into the  urlLink 3MBS  Orchestra Victoria composition competition. I sure hope I win - the main prize is $6K, but even the 'encouragement award' of $2K would make things easier for me.   I see there's other  urlLink compsers  out there on this interweb logging thing. Brilliant. I'm glad I'm not alone.  I've only had time to check out one person's blog so far.  urlLink Dries  mate, I dig your musical intrests and your political views. Keep 'em coming, I say. While you're at it, could you give us better recordings of your compositions? =D  Personally, I haven't written anything in fucking ages.  urlLink Adelaide University  (the newly-formed  urlLink Elder School of Music  in particular) is an incredibly opressive place to be studying music in. The environment is that of a prison. The two student representatives of the Continuing Flinders Street School of Music Students group presented a report to the board of studies last week that brought to light many negative goings on that have happened over the last term. The Board of Studies immediately decided to push this item to be the first one on the agenda, and opened with - and I quote - "We don't like the tone of this report"  Fuck. I can't believe that. First of all,  this  report had a positive note for every negative one, while the one before it was completely negative. Secondly, what kind of reaction is that? You don't like the tone of the report? Fuck you, you're not supposed to like it. It's painting a picture of how your students are having to survive under your guidance. Fuck you. We're not 'whinging about the printers', the printers DON'T FUCKING WORK! That's a pretty fucking major thing to have fuck up, and it takes you fucking three weeks to fix them. The teaching term at this institution is only six weeks long! That means that the printers are out of order for half the term! For the love of all that is good, don't fucking fix the printers if they're older than I am, buy  new  ones! I can't fucking believe it. I am seriously tempted to just drop out of my degree right now, I don't care how close I am to getting that all-important piece of paper, I just can't deal with  urlLink incompetent fuckwits
