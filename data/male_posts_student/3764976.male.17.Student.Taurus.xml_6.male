For an example, I choose to cite a part of my lyrics:  All that I have to dream about, Are the dreams that we shared, Hand in hand we walked across the night, Planning out our life, But now you’re nowhere to be found And I’m left here dumbfound, Knowing that you’re somewhere out there, Knowing that you’re not right here   Pretty lame stuff there I think. Then again, I am still a believer that girls like it when guys write songs for them, although so far it has proven incorrect. I guess the girls will always go for the jackasses and guys like me, who actually care about more than our dicks, will always be left in the dust. I even tried to be a dick to girls and guess what, more girls flirted with me than before! I know there is a huge difference between confidence and being a jerk. I know I am confident in myself, but I also know I am not a jackass. I've only got one year left in this area and I'm all alone still.  Here's something I don't like; girls who give mixed signals. I can think of three girls I've really, REALLY liked or like who make me feel like, hey, maybe I've got a chance with them and they'd like to be with me. Then it all just stops as I am about to ask her. I mean, what the hell! What they say about women being impossible to figure out is true. I'm still wondering what the hell went wrong this time, whether it was something I said or what. Can I get a girl to explain this to me so I can stop fighting myself over this stuff. I'm sick of kicking myself because I think I fucked up a golden opportunity, when in reality I don't know whose fault it is! That will be my summer research project for now. I'll probably start checking into some info later this morning, as I only seem to update in the early morning hours...before I go to bed.   Well, that's two moderately large posts in a row. I'm on a role folks. Until next time, later!
