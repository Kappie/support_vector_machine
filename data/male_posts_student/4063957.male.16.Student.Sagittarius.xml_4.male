Three main things:    listening to:  this will say what songs i've been listening to while i write whatever post.    quote of the day:  a quote from anyone who i've talked to today, and i'll probabyl give some of the background behind that story. i will only use tv quotes and stuff if i can't dig up anything good from anyone. there might also be more then one quote of the day.    feeling:  i know i know, this is so cliche, but oh well, it's fun.   So, without further to do:    listening to:  'View from Heaven' - Yellowcard   quote of the day:   'it can be yours if the price is right'  - Price is Right   feeling : bored
