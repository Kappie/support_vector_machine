I have a crappy dress I really do not like, I have to buy bloody heeled shoes and some dinky bag. I can't do it. Ok, I'm not some kind of tomboy-girl but I'm certainly not a girly girl and this prom is doing my nut. I'd rather have the money from this prom and go get myself a new phone or an MP3 Player (I could probably get both looking at the cost of all this)! Now, ok, it was my choice in the first place whether I went or not. But they are so good at persuading you - for a short amount of time you think it' will be great so you hand in all your money and grin for hours. The suddenly you realise, you're going to end up killing yourself. I'm just looking for the alcohol provided at my friends house before and after the prom. Boo hoo hoo! :(
