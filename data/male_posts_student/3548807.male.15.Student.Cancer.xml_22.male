George Bush is making a speech and you can hear in the backround a person reading him the speach! ha ha ha stupid illiterate bastard. ahh...talking with someone right now...and i guess subliminal messages are the thing. why am i such a cryptic bastard right now...i should just come out right now and say it...yes yes yes...no i just lost it Sam
