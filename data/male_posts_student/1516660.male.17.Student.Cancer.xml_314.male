Gloria got news that CQ will be in the same class as Kelvin. Which one? I don't know. Oh yes, I met ShengQiang at the MRT Station while waiting for the rest to meowingly come. We chatted for quite a bit.  Hmmm. Well well well. I landed up in 04S22, along with CQ and Kelvin Lim! Two Kelvins in the same class again! HaHa! Even ducks ended up in the same class! O.O When we lined up, we saw there were fewer girls than boys. Hmmm. Behind us were three Malay guys. I don't like them. I don't know why. Their attitude leaves much to be desired, I guess. Like, just don't like their attitude lor. Reminds me too much of Faiz.   Hmmm. We went to the LT 4 for our Study Skills workshop. I feel was discriminated against when I was labelled incompetent because I put "prefers studying with radio/TV on" and "i have short concentration span...gets bored easily". Hello!! Baised! After the speech, we went down for break.  Hmm. Break was kinda short, but oh meow. We went up to the hall for some PE/CCA speech. Hmmm. How meowful! Mr Kwok (or Kok?) was kinda sacarstic to the late-comers. "Dignitaries". Heh. After that, was our Contact Time with our CT.  Hmmm. Our CT is Mr Tham. He's very very weird, yet funny at the same time. I don't whether to like him or not. Heh. CQ and Kelvin doesn't. He was their CT last time round. O.O Hmmm. He gave us our timetable and Pupil Profile Form. Ooo! What a fun form to fill up! Yes! Hmmm. He dismissed us for lunch.  Well, I found a dong gu meen in the canteen, and I am never eating that again. The mian and all is alright (the chicken is not shredded), but the dong gu is so toasted! Not soft de! Eeee! My dong gu!! Hmm. I was kinda worried for WQ (meow at Ji), because he didn't meet us for lunch. I thought he was robbed while in the toilet (well, it could happen), because his phone is off. Hmm. It turned out that he was chatting with his OGL and his phone's battery is low.   Well, after lunch, is our CIP. We are supposed to go to some blocks to clean up. Ayioh! the bus carrying our class, S25 and A05 was late!! Oh my god. Me and CQ met someone new, Jeric. Meow moo! Soon, after a long long wait, the bus came! Meow moo!   At the blocks, the clases were given assignements on how to clean up. S22 were told to clean up the dustbins. Wipe them clean, empty the trash and put in a new bag. Ayioh!! Me and CQ paired up with Jeric and another cat (I forgot his name, must ask tomorrow). We went around cleaning la. Wah! Our group was even taken photos of cleaning the dustbin. O.O I wonder if that will be published in the Hong Kah newsletter meow! We have to get back to take more bags several times. Mr Tham said "More bags means more marks for maths!" -.-" Ayioh!! We encountered two very smelly bins! We wanted to puke! Oh my meowing god! Our eyes were watery and I really wanted to vomit lor. That put us off cleaning bins. We returned to the checkpoint proclaiming duty's done. Hmm. We have to wait a while longer to be dismissed.  Darn! No free buses back to school. I wanted to go back to meet my OG to eat dinner together (actually, I called Lit Ping to see if he's going. If he is, it means the otgher two cats are going too, which means I am going too). Wah lao. My card like no more money le lor. Sigh! Me and CQ dropped off at CCK Interchange and I took 190 back to school while he waited for Gloria and Janet.   Hmmm. I met up with my OG at the canteen. We waited for about 30 minutes, till 4.30 for the rest to gather. Hmm. Steve was playing his guitar and some other OGL was singing. O.O Anyway, we took some photos before setting off to Bukit Timah Plaza's Pizza Hut, via 985.   HaHaHa! We are so engrossed chatting with each other that we completely missed our stop! The bus have to drive through a long expressway (BKE? I think). Wah lao. We went down and walked to the opposide side of the road (Joy's scared of heights) to the bus-stop in front of CJC. The irony! HaHa! Some cats in my OG met friends coming out of CJC. LP met a Hong Kong friend and they started chatting in Cantonese. How smooth they sound. HaHa. My Cantonese standard sucks, compared to these natives (I sometimes talk in Canto, then switch to EL/Chinese when I don't know how to express in Canto...Janet and Gloria noticed that on Tuesday). Soon, 985 came and we are on our journey back.  Hmm. We all finally met at the Pizza Hut. Hmm. We guys were sitting at a table, and the girls at another. All the guys talk about are girls lor. Everytime they see a pretty woman walking past (we are sitting next to the full-sized window), they go crazy. I was like very de sian. I didn't eat much, because I don't eat a lot of things there, except Hawaiian Pizza and drumsticks. Hmm. We ate from 6.30 till around 8.  HaHa. I have to go back early, so LP offered to send me to the bus-stop (because I don't know where it is and he lives round here). Woah! The whole OG (what remains of it anyway) tagged along. HaHa. so Paiseh. I need sending off. Thank guys!   I got onto bus 173, which took me to Clementi. From there, I took the MRT towards Admiralty. I have abolsutely no moolah left in my card, so I have to walk back. Due to experimentation, I've found out that walking home via 768 takes a shorter time than walking home via Gloria's route. Shorter by around 3 minutes la. I take around 2 minutes to walk from 768 to my home (WQ that time found it long and slow because he is walking very slowly, shuffle feet somemore. Even normal cats take 2 minutes!!). I came back home at around 9.07.  Hmm. I bathed, then came online. O.O Matt Rogers was voted out. Oh well. I thought Camille would be voted out, since she was second last last week. She's still is this week. Her future ain't looking bright if she doesn't pull her socks up.   Yes yes. Now CQ is waiting for this blog entry. Wait ar, I must mention something. Today, I was SMSing Amanda. I cannot tell what we said due to privacy issues, but we have a good talk. Yep. Hmm. Today Wendy sent me an SMS, saying she appreciates our friendship a lot ("I love you Kel" It brightened up my day. :D). Yes! Friends are always the best.  Okay. I ending le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
