"It's Gonna Be B" To the tune of the *NSync song, "It's Gonna Be Me"  My outline's good, babe That ain't no lie Ev'ry day of class I did go, whoa I did practice exams, yeah And I read all the hornbooks, I studied all night And I'm so bright  [CHORUS] Every single test I take I always make a big mistake And if studying it just ain't enough I snort cocaine and stuff I could see the test before I could have eight hours more Guess what? It's gonna be B  I got no choice, babe, except to try Maybe I should just give up The clerkships -- too hard to see Cause in the end you know it's gonna be B Let down my mom I'm not da bomb  [CHORUS]  It's gonna be B Ooh yeah  There'll be a day When maybe I'll get just one A Till then, It's gonna be B  I think I'd find If I read the prof's mind My answers were great But still it's my fate I'm destined to a grade of B Mediocrity Guess what?  [CHORUS]
