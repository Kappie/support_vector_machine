Today in Tech Assistant, as you may have already noticed, I had nothing to do. For the first half hour of the class (a third of it) the teacher (or supervisor, whatever) was not even there. I went in and it says she was in room 305, so I hauled my butt over there. She gave me the keys and told me I didn't have to do anything. So that's just what I did: nothing. I wrote some stuff on the board for whoever wanted it could read. I added the post just below this one also. I had a longer one, but I accidentally erased it, oh well.   Web page design: Nothing fun. We read an article about  urlLink software piracy , which was pretty funny. Then we had to make a survey and write our opinions on the matter. It was pretty boring and tedious. We spent the first hour trying to get the logo to match the rest of the background. Stupid CSS.   Lunch, I ate food, I was bored so I went into the PC lab and posted at Four Cool Guys. If you want the new URL to it IM me at nintendophreak20.  US History. Wonderful class. She put the work for the day on the board! Yes! I did it all within the first 10 minutes of class, then I took a remake quiz that I really didn't need to take, but I was bored and then we did a worksheet. I was done with 30 minutes left of class, and she let me go. There wasn't anything else to do.   Now I am home and I am kind of tired. I broke my skateboard by just standing on it. It really sort of pissed me off. That was before school. I had to walk home because of it. It wasn't to bad, it could of been worse, it could have been raining. I got a new GCN game (Tony Hawk's Underground) and I can't play it until Friday. Oh well, the wait will be worth it. When my mom got home I went over to my neighbors and had my friend help me with fixing my skateboard. It really feels weird because now it rides like it is supposed to.  I am about to go eat dinner, so I will talk with you all later. Did you konw taht it dnseo't mettar waht oedrr lrettes are in? As lnog as the fsrit and lsat lteter is in the rhgit pclae. Ierinenstg huh? Enve lnog wrdos wrok.
