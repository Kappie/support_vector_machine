But at least it shows they have some goal in mind and something they want to accomplish beyond how the casebook authors thought it should be taught.  What I don't understand is why that stuff happens *even when the professor wrote the casebook.*  If this is how the professor thinks it's taught best, why is the casebook all out of order?
