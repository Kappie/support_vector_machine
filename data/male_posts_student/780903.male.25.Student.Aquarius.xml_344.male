Another theater song -- to the tune of "Footloose"  Been working so long Perfecting each song Rehearsals went late But last night starting at eight The crowd, they liked us Didn't wish they studied instead And techies miked us So they could hear what we said And the audience  Laughed, they laughed They admired our craft   [rhymes are hard...] Awed, guffawed Even chose to applaud Paid, they paid And through intermission they stayed Laughed, they laughed Everybody heard they laughed  No numbers fell flat No set piece went splat No light burst up in flames They laughed at character names The props got set right They didn't fall to the ground No broken spotlight No feedback screwing up the sound But above it all  Laughed, they laughed Even those who are daft   [Like I said, rhymes are hard...] Rapt, they clapped All talent it got tapped Prayed, there'd be An even longer act three Laughed, they laughed Everybody heard they laughed  They all had good things to say Even from seats far away They'll laugh even harder today  Laughed, they laughed Even though no beer on draft  [...glad there's no fourth chorus... out of rhymes...] Cheered, and cheered Cheered, and nobody jeered Got, the plot And it made them laugh a lot Laughed, they laughed Everybody heard they laughed
