I guess that makes me sound less pathetic than if I were to say "found in the course of my reading" or "searched for and found."  Truth is, in this case, I do try and check the Daily 'Prince every couple of days or so, in case there's anything interesting.  And in the case below, I was actually searching for other law student weblogs -- so to say I "stumbled across" it is not exactly forthcoming.  I read stuff on the web too much.  It's a mild addiction -- there's always more interesting news to find.  And I know it makes no sense to read the sports sections of 5 different New York area newspapers each morning to get the widest perspective possible on the Mets' search for a new manager, especially since they're all tailored versions of the same Assoicated Press wire story.  But it's healthier than Diet Coke, at least according to the 'Prince article.
