Last night I got a call from my girl Tiffany (one of the 9 or so Tiffany's I know).....she called me and asked me what today's date was....I knew right away what the problem was....I forgot yet another birthday....  I am too lazy to get my PDA fixed....and even then I probably wouldn't use it....but I need to find a way to remember birthdays....unless i get a daily reminder leading up to it I'm going to forget....that's pretty much a given with me if your name isn't Nina, Che, Pat or C. Miles....at any rate I feel terrible....  So to Eulus (I forgot his birthday last year....my oldest and best friend....if I forgot his, I don't think anyone is vulnerable), Tiffany, Beth, hell the list is too long....I'm sorry....I owe alot of dinners man....  Ugh....anyway I didn't do as well on my Biochem test as I thought I did (although I still passed with little problem).....anyway that shows me I need to buckle down and get for real....  Time to read a little and get ready for Monday Night Football....tomorrow will be a run down on the NFL....
