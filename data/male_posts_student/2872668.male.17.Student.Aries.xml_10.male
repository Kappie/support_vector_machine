They even got me to cough up n return the free shirt! Well, it looks awful anyway. Haha...luckily, i was just in time for CO practice! We had some new song scores for nxt year's SYF. I was the only cello/bass member there again...Wudao was there too (ha, he didnt bring consent form as well...), but his skills weren't good enuf to perform in the main orchestra yet. Our conductor said i was rather hardworkin and a quick learner as well...heheh. Then he more than made up for it by criticisin my playin later on! Said he'll ignore me for now, since i was makin too many mistakes. Grr. It was my first time playin in a month k...  Sigh. Tomorrow i have one class outing in the morn and an og (orientation grp) outing in the afternoon. Wonderin if i should go for either of them. The class...i just dont like it. Yet there are so many nice ppl...Gab,Jeremy,CheeKeen,Renfang, just to mention a few...wat a pity, realli. And my og....its on the brink of extinction. We havent had an outin since once in term 1. How sad. Khaiphang is beggin me to go...so im unsure if i shd disappoint him.  I was on a rampage of playin games after the CTs...completed E.V.O. The Search for Eden. It left me with a dismal, depressin feeling. Survival of the fittest...i wonder. In the game i was evolvin to better overcome the opponents...yet wat abt them? Wat do the fish feel when they are eaten up? Do they have equal chances at the evolution cycle? Life is so, so cruel...Yet we have emotions to forget this core purpose of life momentarily. Whether it is happiness, anxiety, or sadness, they serve as a disguise. Bless the brain for providin us with meaning and nourishin the heart with hope. Nothin is worse than the absolute cold, heartless soul of the universe.  If there be God, I curse him.   Preposterous! Do you begrudge me life? Of beauty and warmth,ever tender to the touch. Yet fraught with hate, sadness, and strife... ...i see now. I would surmise as much.
