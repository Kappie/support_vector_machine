But this is what I wrote and it's too long to be a song. So it's in here.  Loveless Fight  My life is empty full of void I’m a case worthy of Doctor Freud I look deep with in my mind With despair but unable to find The reason for my emptiness And the path to true and utter bliss  I’d search forever never turning back Just to catch a glimpse of that person I lack You may not know my name Or even from where I came But I hope I’ll find you And I’ll never stop until I do  Everything seemed wrong I thought it was over my life just gone But then I saw you that one day And you completely blew my mind away You didn’t even notice me But I was there, unable to breathe  I watched you walk by You’re grace, catching my eye You’re beauty captured me But my sorrow, kept me free You didn’t even see me but just walked away Leaving my world so dark and gray  My mind raced through day and night Only remembering the joy of that sight I knew you were the one But my misery was not undone I didn’t even know who you were But there was one thing for which I was sure
