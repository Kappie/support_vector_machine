Even if it is a crappy tag team in Drew's eyes. Oh yeah...and Drew...I'm not a geezer either...I'm far from it, about 15 years farther away than you!!!   #1--The New Age Outlaws ("The Road Dogg" Jesse James  "The Bad Ass" Billy Gunn):   These guys were gold. As I recall my first time seeing them was on the Monday Night Raw, right after Mania 14. They were to face the team of Chainsaw Charlie (Terry Funk) and Cactus Jack (Mick Foley...for all you fools out there). This was not just going to be any simple match. Ya see the stip was, the night before they fought in a dumpster match. The Outlaws lost...getting sealed in THE WRONG DUMPSTER. Therefore, the titles were vacent and were to be defended on that particular night. The Outlaws won it, while also becoming part of D-generation X (already with Triple H, X-Pac, and Chyna). DX then became my one of my favorite groups.ever.   #2--The Dudleys (D-Von  Buh Buh Ray):  These guys have done it all. They are the only tag team to win all of the top 3 tag titles of the moder era, ECW Tag Titles (9 time champs), WCW Tag Titles (1 or 2 times champs), WWF/E Tag Titles (5 or 6 times champs). Is there anything about these guys that you can hate? One black and one white guy; what a combo! These guys are funny, and they can kick some major @ss too!!  We Want Tables!    #3--The Road Warriors (Hawk  Animal):  To directly quote Drew - "Only because you can't mention great tag teams without mentioning them.  'Nuff said." Plus I didn't even like these guys, and they still made it to number 3 on my list!   #4--The APA (Bradshaw  Ron Simmons):   Drink Beer or Fight!  These guys were nuts! They were fighting everywhere. Bars, in the back, in the parking lot, and they even had good ring skills. These two were fairly decent by themselves...but together, they made quite the team. They are even the guys that Vince looks for to put some guys in-line that aren't doing their job right!   #5--(tie) The Headbangers (Mosh  Thrasher) and Owen Hart (RIP)  Jeff Jarrett:  The Headbangers were pretty funny, and awesome to watch. They pulled off some great tag team moves. Like something simple, such as powerbombing your partner...onto your opponent lying on the ground. They had so much chemistry in the ring. It was nuts. I also loved the way they would taunt their opponents. -- Jarrett and Owen made a really fast ride to the top as a tag team. They won the titles from Ken Shamrock and the Big Boss Man on Raw one week. Boy did I hate them...but man I loved Debra! Their title run fell short just a few weeks before the tragic death of Owen Hart. Rest In Peace.   #6--The Two Man Power Trip (Triple H and Stone Cold Steve Austin):  These guys didn't seem too tough to beat, if faced by the right tag team that is. But alone these guys were top notch power houses. They ruled the wrestling world, and still do. Together they made a nearly unbeatable group. Austin was already the Heavyweight Champion, and Trips was the IC Champ too. I cant recall if they won the tag titles at that time too...but I know that they held them at one point or another. Because they lost them to Benoit and Jericho.   #7--(3 way tie) Kane  Mankind, The Brothers of Destruction (Kane and Taker), and The Minestry (Taker and Big Show):  All of these guys weren't together for too long (a few months to a half year), and they weren't anything special, but I think that they deserve to at least be mentioned. They were all forces that were not to be reconned with!  There are so many mediocre to good teams that I could mention. And remember I dont have too much experience with tag teams either...so bare with me!
