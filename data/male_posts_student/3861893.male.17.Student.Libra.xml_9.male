He noted that first came the date of her birth and spoke of the date with tears  but he said what mattered most of all  was the dash between those years.  For that dash represents all the time  that she spent alive on earth, and  now only those who loved her know  what that little line is worth.  For it matters not how much we own; the cars, the house, the cash.  What matters is how we live and loved and how we spend our dash.  So think about this long and hard, Are there things you'd like to change? For you never know how much time is left  You could be at "dash mid-range"   If we could just slow down enough  to consider what's true and real, and always try to understand  the way other people feel, and  be less quick to anger, show appreciation more and love the people in our life like we've never loved before.  If we treat each other with respect,  more often wear a smile  remembering that this special dash  might only last a little while.   So when your eulogy is being read with your life's actions to rehash... would you be pleased with the things they say about how you spent your dash?
