All the way since Nintendo 64, the thought of Zelda with cutting edge GCN graphics instead of Wind Waker's cell shaded toon graphics. I didn't believe it at first until I saw the video and pictures and heard Mr. Nintendo officially announce the title at e3 this year. Just like Ocarina of Time, this will probably end up being the best game of the console. I'm so excited. Now I can't wait for the Rush concert and the release for this game. Not only the next Zelda but also Metroid Prime 2:Echoes, Resident Evil 4, multiple Donkey Kong games, another gameboy Zelda game (Minish Cap), Star Fox and a new hand held system called Nintendo DS with graphics better than N64...here's the e3 site.  urlLink CLICK!  Ok so besides e3 excitement, nothing else happened today. Well I took a really hard math test today and an extremely easy Italian test. I have to catch up in English with The Glass Menagerie but I don't want to, I hate plays, I hate books! So I'm just gonna get answers from someone tomorrow. Drum lessons were fun. I watched The Hulk, pretty good movie. Just not enough action but there was too much thinking involved. When I got home I also found this game called AIR STRIKE, it's free and it kicks ass, if you want it im me. Ok I'm gonna pass out soon so I need to sleep. Goodbye.
