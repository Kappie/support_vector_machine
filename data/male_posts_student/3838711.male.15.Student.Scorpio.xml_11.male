Had a rather brightened day..    Somewhat that idiot who did something unpleasantyesterday was suspended today, when he didnt admit to anotherwrong he did... i'm so damn happy he is suspended, to hell with that loser. Smooth day today. Loved this day at school, haha. Somewhat the thoughts in my brain didnt surface, and my mood stayed clear the whole day... guess this should be a rarity in a thousand days ? Lol.    Went to tampines to check out the price and the offer for EA classic.. basket, Challenger didnt have the offer around.... damn.. ended up with Kun Long buying his CD-Rs and DVD+RW... and got a CD for Joei's birthday... hope she likes it when she gets it... :)    Relatively short entry...I suppose.. but hey, its a contrast to all the other posts way back... the mood's different, yeah ? hehe... Yeah, thats for today...    Peace out. :)
