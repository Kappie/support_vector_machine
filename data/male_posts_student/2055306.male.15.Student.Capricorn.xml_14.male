I've always known that I need to fall in love with God but I had no idea what that meant, or even how to go about doing it! I mean, I pray everynight, I talk to God, I occasionally flip open my Bible and read whatever my eyes fall upon, but I wasn't getting fed. I was still hungry for God. I didn't know what else to do besides fall in love with Him.   But then for years now its just like, I mean I tell God I love Him all the time. But I know I don't fully mean it. Because I'm NOT in love yet. I didn't know how to do that. I knew first of all that to fall in love you have to have a relationship. Easy enough, I mean, if I were to fall in love with a human, I'd have to know them, and build a relationship. So in human terms, how do I do that? Well, I talk to them, I become friends, I know I would read anything that someone I loved wrote to me, and God has one macho love letter to me called the Bible.   But it's not enought to just read His words. Becuase all I get are words, not meanings. So then I thought, well, I have to do a devotion, because it focuses on part of His words, and you relate it to something, and then you actually get something out of the words. Another way I am trying to fall in love with God is just to talk to Him. Not just pray. To not even think that the only way we can talk to God is through prayer, but to just talk like I would to my best friend. Tell Him whats up in my life. Yeah he already knows whats happening, but He loves it when we tell Him.   I'm just longing to fall in love with Him, and I want to be consistant in my getting to know Him. Reading His words. Talking to Him. Everything. I want to keep that excitment I have for what lies ahead, and I want to wake up each morning feeling more and more joy and excitment.   Wow this was long. Well so if you could be praying for me I'd really appreciate it. I know that as I get close to God, the more the devils gonna hate it and try to tear me down. But we wont let that happen! =D Thanks.
