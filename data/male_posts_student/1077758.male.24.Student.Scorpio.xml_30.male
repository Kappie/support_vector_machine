I'm not really sure if I'm looking forward to this--every vacation, apart from where we go, seems the same. We see some stuff, get lost a few times on the way, scream at each other, annoy each other, and then come home.  I know they make movies about crap like this, but is this NORMAL? I want to go somewhere and relax, not worry about finding Upteenth Street and Hairy Avenue.  Ah well.  For those that read this.....signing off.
