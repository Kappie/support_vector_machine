Saw bus 165 behind so decided to take it to AMK mrt station and from there take mrt to dover. On the mrt, I discovered that all the stations from cityhall to dover take about 2 minutes each. I'm almost late for class, which is very lucky cos just aft I stepped into the design studio as Mr Idris is taking attendence, my name is being called... haha lucky for me but poor Raymond, he is late by about 20 secs or so...       Den we went to the duno wat place to have a common briefing. Mr Idris brief us about a project tat we have to do... blah blah blah... aft tat we went back to the design studio, our home base, to start doing the project work. Everyone has to draw something and try to distort it by moving it when photocopying it. I drew a pic of my digital cam, digital cam cover and my hp. As we are only required to do one, I decided to use my drawing of my digital cam.       Den lunch time, our group (Xin Hao, Raymond, Meme, Victor, Jun Qing and me) went to foodcourt 3, wah... full house, so we went to foodcourt 5. Eating KFC... so expensive, mac more cheaper... all of us bought Zinger meal. Den aft lunch, we went back to design studio to collect a sheet of notes given by Mr Idris. Had to try very hard not to fall asleep when Mr Idris is talking about the notes. The contents of the notes are very chim loh, a lot of words dun even noe how to pronounce...       Aft reading the notes, we went to photocopy our drawings. Went to a shop but the photocopying machine cannot reduce the size... ap. Den we went to the library to photocopy. Had to go back by 4pm so by the time we finish photocopying, it is minutes to 4 so we just take all the copies and rush back to the design studio.       Aft sch we went to the library again to photocopy some more, cos they say theirs is still not nice. So they photocopied some more, by cashcard no $$$ liao, so had to top up the cashcard but the auntie who is supposed to be at the counter went for toilet break. Think she stuck in the toilet bowl cos we waited for almost an hour for her to come back.       When the auntie came back, the cashcard couldn't be topped up cos nobody had ATM card, so Xin Hao and Victor went to borrow cashcard. Waited very de long for them to come back. While waiting, the rest of us talk with a senior about our course, he say until like very stress like tat. Aft they came back, they continued to photocopy some more and by the time they finish, it was almost 6pm liao.          Transport taken today: Mrt, bus 165, bus 74      Feeling: Sianz      Thoughts: Think about Her again... haiz... saw her online den suddenly disappear liao...
