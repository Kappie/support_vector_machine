I guess I'll have to watch it in the theaters like normal people.  It was another non eventful day... I went to Olive Garden with Jenny for lunch today. Wine and pasta was a nice change from my pub food and beer. That was probably the highlight of my day. I think the second highlight was trying those mint things that Ozzy tried... those thin sheets... Thelma had some at work and I tried one. It was weird. It didn't taste too good either, but it did freshen my wine breath up.  Woohoo going to see  Alkaline Trio  tomorrow night. Good stuff!  ***
