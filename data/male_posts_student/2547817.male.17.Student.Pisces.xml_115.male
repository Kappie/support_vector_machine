I have learnt so much, of poetry, drama and such, that when I'm happy... I don't miss  her  touch.  I can't think of any more rhymes now... too tired.. And I'll be mugging till late coz I've got exams on, on monday. Will post a super duper trooper looong one about CAP soon.  What I want to tell you now is this.  I'M BACK! In more ways than just the tangible aspects of my being.  I am happy.
