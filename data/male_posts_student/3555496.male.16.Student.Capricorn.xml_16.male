I got two mikes all the time...   Sweet and sour like a tangerine Fresh like a box of Krispy Kremes Kenny Rogers' Gambler is my gambling theme Mix Master Mike with the scratch routine Always updated and in the know You know we break it down going toe to toe The bass is booming from down below And Norton is chillin with Mario Well my name is Adrock I'm a Scorpio Don't ask me cause I just don't know I'm known to mop I'm known to glow But don't get mad cause I got to go  Three MCs and one DJ We be getting down with no delay Mix Master Mike whatcha got to say?  Ga, ga-ga ga gotta gotta gotta get down!   Mix Master cut faster! Mix Master, cut...cut...cut faster!  All top secret and classified I grab a hold of a mic and let the words glide It's all hypnotic and sanctified I never wanna let a bad day slip by We be getting stupid in your area Causing all kinds of hysteria My beats is sick like malaria But don't worry I'll take care of ya Me and Adam Adam and Mario C When we're in the studio it's the place to be To all beings everywhere be happy and free With Mix Master Mike we're making history  Three MCs and one DJ We be getting down with no delay Mix Master Mike what you got to say?  Goddamn that DJ made my day!
