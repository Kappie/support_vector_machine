The nib is pshed all the way in, making it hard to write. Another way is that the nib bends about 60 degrees. Either way the quality of the pen is compromised, or the pen is unable to write at all.  And I don't want to throwit away, I'll try to use it till the ink runs out, or I'll feel guily dat I did not preserve nature's resources, and also that I did not preserve my money. Of course I'll be lucky if it cannot work, or I'll have to throw it away without guilt.   FACTFILE: Pilot G-Tec-C4    Length of nib:  0.4mm  Cost:  abt S$3.00 for pen, abt S$2.00 for refill. (simple math shows that the plastic costs abt S$1.00 meaning the plastic is of high quality, in tandem with the high quality ink.)  Ink quality:  High  Type:  Cap  Colours avaliable: Dark Blue, Red, Green, Black, Light Blue, Purple, Pink, + more  User comments:  I am happy as I am able to write very well with it. It is smooth, does not smudge, and can be used for quite a long time. When writing with it, I found myself much neater. However, nib gets easily spoilt, and cap becomes loose after a long time. Try not to drop it a lot of times.   jeremi.fact
