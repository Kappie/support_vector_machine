It's full of oil and all I need is to put gas in the tank and we're ready to run. Supplies are low, we can run for maybe 12-24 hours on what we have now. But hey, that's long enough...   At this time I am confident that we'll be fine. If the power is to go out, I don't think it will be for long. The rain is begining to fall in VA at this hour, so now I'm going to sit and wait. More updates to come.    UPDATE: All of this is now void. Hurricane (Tropical Storm) Charley missed us and is now off shore of MD/DE. The generators still oiled up...and I'm still ready for any power outtage that could happen.
