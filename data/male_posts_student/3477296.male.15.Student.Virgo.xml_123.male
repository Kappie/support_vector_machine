Seeing as every1's writing all these deep n meaningfuls take these wise words from Grandmaster cHoWy. u guyz get 2 worked up. "Lets stop spending time on the comp and do more stuff we can look back" pfffft yeah rite, hu u kiddin. I tried this b4, tryin to do useful stuff so u can b proud .. doesn't work ... u js need to 'calm ur farm' n hv fun. This life is temporary so no need to do all this fancy look back at stuff because u neva kno wen 'ur friends mite get killed in a freak petrol fight accident'. (I fink dats how it goes??? corrections). haha lets hv a Edebate. Js lyk pokemon cards and yoyo's blogs r a fad. They're gud while they last but don't go ohhh i wasted my time.. i spent time/money on pokemon cards.. and i don't regret it bc it was gud wen it happened, I kno heaps of ppl go.... awwwwww i shudn't hv done that but really i wudn't change nething. "No one gives a shit about our blog." You cut me deep Jack u cut me real deep... Srsly if ur not on ur computer wat r u going to do... become a nerd n study all day, well "Earth to Andy", that's not going to make u happier, prouder, less pissed off, or nething in the future or now.  "'haha andy, you don't have any friends anyway'. that would be the person that always jokes around, is fun loving, not the type to comfort a friend but is usually really smart." wow... ur psychologist brain is really coming thru.. u passed dat test :P wif flying colours, so true, very insightful thinkingness, i wuz js thinking that while i was reading ur blog. "i'm not even 15 yet" ?!?!?! yes u r.... or mbe im js lost :S "i'm thinking about all the problems in life...dude" . Earth to Andy, that's nothing special, every1 does... and TRUST ME once u get ova the little dillema life js gets betta n betta, I kno from experience, sumtimes u js need a lil bump in the right direction(not sure if ne1's noticed ne changes in me ova time... but i kno i have). And about u being a metro .. is that such a bad thing, I mean every1 CARES about their appearance, or more correctly their IMAGE. Not necessarily looks but test scores or computer techiness or their perception by other ppl. To be labelled sumthing which defines you is not necessarily a bad thing, if u rn't then its another story. Sum1's a lil unhappy abt himself *tear* "I hate myself at the moment" and that is the reason y u don't lyk being called a metro. I 2 hv been 'jokingly called  a metro' for ..... various reasons :P hehe we can b metro buddies but I don't mind. If i'm a metro im a metro (not that i necessarily am).  on another note, not blogging/using your computer and chatting isn't going to change nething, ull js ahve more spare wated time, and that's not a gud thing. The real cause of the problem, is much .... deeper hehe INNER JOURNEY - english.  newayz, since every1's deserting me I kno no1'll come bak to read my blogs *sigh* so if i don't post here again its good bai from grandmaster cHoWy ~a.k.a Mr. Match    ~ grandmaster cHoWy
