I'm starting to think that friends are really nothing anymore... Why? I don't know...  First things first... If any one want to come and scold me, please come and talk to the people who are involved... Its so simple for people to change his or her story to his or her own advantage... Didn't you guys study History or at least Social Studies??? THe most basic thing is not to rely on one source as it might be biased and at least compare two sources if it matches or contridict! Don't give people faces to see upon hearing ones complain ok... This what i hate most... Not refering to any one here but i believe everyone would experienced it before... TO ALL: DON'T JUMP INTO CONCLUSION WITHOUT DIGGING OUT THE EVIDENCE!!!  Next thing... If you guys are unable to take my jokes or what so ever, Just speak up. At most i will be serious with you if you can't take it... Don't go complaining to other people... Yea, i know my reputation is bad in this school, so??? I don't care! Be it i am childish or what, i still think what i've done is right...    Know what??? I'm wondering, since you guys are so unhappy with me, why don't you say??? I believe you guys are really desperate to tell me... Why not??? Any way, its not going to kill me or what... Let me think... PErhaps from now on, i would be serious to every single one except Shi Kai and Aisyah... At least they could stand it and did not take any offence out of it.... Speaking of them, i really enjoys chatting and joking with them... We do not have limits to everything... Especially jokes... We don't always fight with one another and you know, we get along quite well... In fact, better than some of my friends whom i know since secondary one or two...  Shi kai is my friend for around 3 years plus... We've been studyign int eh same class since secondary one... We don't really talk to each other till this year... My first impression is that he is a proud guy... (as i've said, looks might be deceiving...) Really regretted that didn't know him since secondary one... Well, he always seems to be a guy without any temper... Everytime we will keep insulting him but he just won't show his temper!!! He is really damn good!!! Enjoy sitting infront of him... Yea...  Next is Aisyah... Yea... Another crazy girl... Haha... Appear to be wild, but not... Haha... However, she is well know for being very very vain... She jokes alot and can say is the joker among the three of us... Some time really admire her alot... How can she still be happy when she failed her paper at times??? I don't really understand this... But i'm quite greatful that she didn't show her black face to us...   Hmm... There are still lots of stuff to type it out, however i've little time to talk about it... Yes... I will end here... Take care!  Quote of the day (from Harry Potter): "You might even have a scar now, if you're lucky... That's what you want, isn't it?" -Harry to Ron  Love Louis
