Yeah we were going downhill through some bush to the field and all the sticks like slapped my legs on the way down. There are like a million scratches on my ankles. But my passenger thought it was pretty funny, so I guess it was all for a good cause. We had some hella gay water balloon fight outside. It actually wasn't even a water ballon  fight , we all just kinda stood around while the stupid officers threw water balloons at us from the truck. I gave up after about five minutes and decided to leave. Those stupid weenies. They hyped everyone up like it was gonna be cool and it was just another letdown.  All that money I gave towards the end-of-band picnic was wasted too. The food sucked. I want my $13.67 back.  I got my schedule last night at school. I have two alternating classes, which is a  bitch . It's cool, at least I got everything I wanted. I'm just a little nervous because I've heard bad things about 3 of my teachers. But what can you do, huh?  ------  I noticed this colorguard today. A  certain  colorguard. Orange hat. Flag. Pole. Hair... I thought she looked pretty hot. I talked to her, but I forgot what about. OMG I forgot her name.   Haha she had Mudd on her hat.
