However, in all seriousness it has been quite irritating doing all the little html thingies on my own just guessing what they are.  Sunday night I probably spent two hours getting the banners to look right.  Then last night I spent around an hour adding a "Blog's I Read" section and a counter to the bottom of the page.  Tonight I added a "Contact Me" link and for some reason the font would not change so if it wants to be a thorn in my side then I will just leave it.  Well, not for long, because it is driving me insane.  I just need to figure out how to fix it.  I was told I had no life because I spent so much time on my blog.  Just so you know, the average American watches at least three hours of TV a day.  I do not.  Is it worse to spend three hours watching TV or typing and problem solving?  Something to think about.  Also several people have told me recently I should work out.  I say to you, bah humbug.  I need to gain weight first.  Which I am trying very hard to do.  So after I gain 40-60 pounds...I  may  consider serious physical activity on a daily basis.  Don't quote me on that.
