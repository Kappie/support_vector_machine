I remember that epidose of Lizzie mcguire....where she becomes friends with her mom and her mom tells her all these htings like tax problems and her grandma wanting a divorce, and lizzie is all like 'oh no i cant take it'. i thought it was moronic, and she immature. but i sort of get her now...lol  lets look at everything now. well, one day ur like 'yeah, my familys like PERFECT, and my aprents friends and stuff are all rich and happy.' hm. quick look at what the truth is. My grandma had a drinking problem throughout my moms childhood, and ten years ago started AA. she is afraid she'll go back, and so is still in it. This drinking problem stems from her inability to face problems, which help lead to the fact that her 2nd daughter has had 2 divorces(maybe 3?) and her 3rd daughter has an infant and is married to a convict in jail. nice.  And darian's parents....they might divorce. sicne julyish theyve sort of been on the brink of it. they have different personalities, but theyve gotten through like 9 years already.........whats 40 more? and darians so young.......some of it is because annie misses her  home.....fucking diaspora(dispersing)...thats why she went to Iran with daria only in december.....i really hope nothing happens bad with majic and her...  i have big test wednesday, DBQ wednesday, work that night, and big english essay thursday......:(  and to top it all off, havent talked to brighton in a while...at least had a meaningful conversation. and brighton is sorely depressed. she was dizzy when i saw her. God spares no one it seems. dios nos ayude.  other languages always sound so beautiful. thats why i love them....you're in your own world that only those u want can understand you in. its like why i like movies...escape from reality and the hell that surrounds us.  OK...what else i hate: diaspora, laws that allow divorce(lol),  DBQ's, depression, deadlines, war, hatred, anger, violence.  ceci left for LA today..she leaves tomorrow night at 1 in the morning for san salvador...im sad abotut hat.....i really hope nothing happens to her..i have fear...  i gotta go...people milling about...  i wish i could write forever...and forget about life.....write about everythign and nothing....  much love  peace for the stricken  ~alex
