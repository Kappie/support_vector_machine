So far the line-up is: Pearl Jam, Wilco, Willie Nelson, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, (unfortuntely) Incubus, and many more! I will expect a big-ass tribute to Johnny Cash (especially from Willie Nelson). Knowing me, I'm gonna flip-out cause I'm gonna see Pearl Jam and Wilco. I'm also anxious about seeing Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. What a line-up!   This ain't no AFI concert where you can wait days after tickets go on sale and honestly expect to get tickets. For a concert like the Bridge School, when it says,  "Tickets on sale 10 a.m. on Sunday,"  they mean it. DO NOT expect to just get tickets a hour after they go on sale. That my fellow brothers is pure 100% stupidity!  Well, I'm kinda too tired to type, so this is Seth saying,  "Adios amigos!"
