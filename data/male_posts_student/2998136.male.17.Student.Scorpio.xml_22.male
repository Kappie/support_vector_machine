Wate-of-time wrong.  The best way to a flat stomache is through your brain. Here are 4 bug myths about Six-Pack Abs.   MYTH 1:   Abdominal muscle is different from regular muscle. Ab muscle is ab muscle. Period. Like your quads, your biceps.   There's no structural difference, no psychological difference, no difference in how ab muscle conracts and how it gets stronger.  "The abdominals are different only in location" explains an exercise physiologist. "They are not resting on a body surface, like the biceps or quads. Instead, they span like a bridge over a cavern. Look at any anatomy book. But that doesn't change basic physiology or law of scince."    MYTH 2:   You have to train abs at least every other day.   Train them, at most, every other day to leave time for recovery, justlike any other muscle group, say an instructor of personal trainers.  "You abs cab get strong and stay strong with twice a week workouts," he suggests, but you have to train them hard enough.  The key is to choose an exercise that fatique the muscle, so that they need recovery time to get stronger. Add some exercises that use the abs functionally - in other words, the way you are used in real life.  For example, abdominals are used to stabilise your body. Feel this function by holding a push-up position without letting your belly sag. Don't do the push-ups - just keep holding the position and feel your abs going crazy to stabilise your body. If that's easy, put your feet on a weight bench, or even better, a stability ball. Now, you'll really feel your abs.    MYTH 3:   Ab exercises melt away abdominal fat.  Spot reducing has been disproved over and over again, but this persists. "You can't get rid of fat by repeatedly exercing one body part."  Chew gum - you won't get skinny cheeks. Do crunches in the best form - you won't whittle your waistline or belly. You may develop abs of steel, but they'll still be covered by fat if you don't do cardio to reduce it.  "Doing ab exercises for reducing waistline is a fool's errand. Reducing waistline has to do with reducing body fat." Burning abdominal fat the same as burning fat anywhere on your body: You have to do aerobic exercise and of course, restrict your caloric intake. "Your diet and large-muscle activity will accomplish much more than 1, 000 sit-ups a day." says expert.     MYTH 4:   High numbers of repetitions are required to make gains.  Let's say you want to work your biceps. Would you do 100 concentration with a 25lb weight? Making abdominal gains follow the principle : overload.   The reason we think we have to do so many reps is that we're not working them hard enough.
