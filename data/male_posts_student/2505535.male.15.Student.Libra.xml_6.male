Ah man.. we musta talked to much bullshit, something about warcraft 2, and stuff, most fun, but now I'm pretty full, re-eating again once I got in wasn't such a great idea, and Elliott was most nice and gave me and Dave a lift home, w0o!  I think my dad's gunna make me and Dave tidy our room tmz, but he hasn't mentioned it since last wed.. so I'm hoping he's forgotten.. it's pretty likely that he has, but he's often quiet about these things anyway.  Oh, and I finished El Goonish Shive, now I can just read the updates, so that's good, I think I need to stay still alot now, and get alot of fluids, lol.
