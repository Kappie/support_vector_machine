Strange, maybe this will wear out sooner or later and I'll probably abondon this site, like a site I made in primary school  urlLink http://www.maxpages.com./websurfie . It's completely empty so don't bother finding anything there, unless you want to take a test on how fast you can type over there...  Today there's going to be a family photo taking thing, so my family went to the early morning worship so as to come back early enough to prepare for the photo taking. I assure you this is not going to be those let-granny-take-the-picture one, it's one of those "professional studio" thing. The occasion? My father got his master degree in business, and he wants to remember this occasion. I hate having my picture taken. I hate it even more if I must smile against my will, but oh well, if it pleases my parents, whatever.  I read this comic strip "baby blues" (not today's newspaper). Anyway in it, the mother, Wanda was telling her children "From now on, you are only allowed to say, yes mom, okay mom, sure mom, of course mom, no problem mom, right away mom and that sort of thing when I ask you to set up the table." The comic strip ends with hammie telling zoe, "I still think whatever sounds better." To which zoe would reply "shh... don't let her hear that."  I learnt today that I must be generous to others, all because my mother bought tissues from a woman and her blind mother selling them at the market today.
