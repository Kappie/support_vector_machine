However, I heard that Man should learn from the mistakes we made from the past, not recreate them. So today, I shall rest my nonsensical mouth and let the famous people do their talking for me.    Albert Einstein       "Peace cannot be achieved by force, it can only be maintained though understanding"    "The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing."    "Count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who conquers his enemies; for the hardest victory is over self. "    "The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of  thinking we were at when we created them."    "In essence, the conflict that exists today is no more than an old-style struggle for power, once again presented to mankind in semireligious trappings. The difference is that, this time, the development of atomic power has imbued the struggle with a ghostly character; for both parties know and admit that, should the quarrel deteriorate into actual war, mankind is doomed. Despite this knowledge, statesmen in responsible positions on both sides continue to employ the well-known technique of seeking to intimidate and demoralize the opponent by marshaling superior military strength. They do so even though such a policy entails the risk of war and doom. Not one statesman in a position of responsibility has dared to pursue the only course that holds out any promise of peace, the course of supranational security, since for a statesman to follow such a course would be tantamount to political suicide. Political passions, once they have been fanned into flame, exact their victims ... Citater fra..."     Einstein's Unfinished Last Words       Mohandes K. Gandhi       "Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will."    "The things that will destroy us are: politics without principle; pleasure without conscience; wealth without work; knowledge without character; business without morality; science without humanity; and worship without sacrifice."    "Hate the sin and not the sinner is a precept which though easy enough to understand is rarely practiced, and that is why the poison of hatred spreads in the world."    "You must be the change you wish to see in the world."    "Whether humanity will consciously follow the law of love, I do not know.  But that need not disturb me. The law will work just as the law of gravitation works, whether we accept it or not.  The person who discovered the law of love was a far greater scientist than any of our modern scientists.  Only our explorations have not gone far enough and so it is not possible for everyone to see all its workings."
