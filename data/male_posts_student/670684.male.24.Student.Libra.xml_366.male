Easy...girlfriends are pretty straightforward to remember.  The true test of my memory is that I remember what happened to that Yuban can there in the picture.  This picture was taken when I was in Kindergarten, so I was four or five here.  The Yuban can was transformed into structure for a bust of Brother Bear from the Berenstein Bears, which my mom created minutes before school started, dismantling mine because mine sucked, and she was so proud of it that she made me bring it home and it actually moved with us from San Diego to Arkansas.    Picture courtesy of Colin Young, where San Diego is representing and Starbucks is still loathing.
