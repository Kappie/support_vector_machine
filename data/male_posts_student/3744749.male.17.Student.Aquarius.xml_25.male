Saw Fahrenheit 9/11 with a friend who's compentency behind the wheel I am beginning to have serious doubts over. All should see it. Had a hard time concentrating on last third of it because my stomach felt like it had flaming knives in it, so after went to In'n Out and talked crazy mad shit about my arch nemesis, Sky (yay). Seemed a little overly persuasive seeing as how if you were watching it you were most likely not a crazy BUSH4LIFE right wing conservative, but nonetheless a very good movie. Reminded me of how much I don't like dead babies minus half a head. I can honestly say Bush is indeed the black angel of death.  !  BRAWR! WORK=DEATH! MY BOSSES AND EVERYONE EMPLOYED BY THEM SHOULD ALL BE SHOT, MINUS ROBIN. ESPECIALLY MARY, MY TWIT ASS BOSS, WHO SHOULD BE BEHEADED FOR BUYING VINYL BASED PUTTY INSTEAD OF PLASTER BASED PUTTY AND MAKING MY BENCH LOOK LIKE ASS AND FOR TELLING ME TO FINISH MY PAINTING IN ONE DAY WHEN IT HAS TAKEN THREE DAYS OF NEARLY CONSTANT WORK TO DO HALF. MMM RUN ON SENTENCES...IF SHE FUCKING TELLS ME TO TURN DOWN MY MUSIC ONE MORE TIME IM GOING TO SLIT HER THROAT. CAN'T WAIT TO GET PAYCHECK. CAN'T WAIT TO NEVER SEE BOSSES AGAIN. CAN'T WAIT TO SABOTAGE THE SHOWCASE. CAN'T WAIT TO NOT HEAR HOT STONERS TALK ANYMORE. CANT WAIT TO NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH DAVID TRYING TO TALK TO ME ABOUT MUSIC. THE ONE THING ABOUT WORK THAT I WILL MISS IS EATING THAI FOOD NEARLY EVERYDAY. THIS IS ALL IN CAPITOLS BECAUSE NORMAL LOWER CASE LETTERS CANT FULLY EXPRESS MY RAGE.
