In the month of May I’ve watched  A Better Tomorrow ,  The One ,  Iron Monkey ,  Ichi the Killer ,  Shrek 2 ,  Van Helsing ,  The Triplets of Bellville ,  School of Rock ,  From Hell ,  Eurotrip ,  Reign of Fire ,  The Rundown  and  The Last Samurai . These are all movies that I’ve seen for the first time, and for the most part all these movies were good. (Ichi the Killer was just extremely disturbing.) I watched a Japanese movie recently called  Versus , that was cool despite starting off slow.     I also saw the season finale of   The O.C.   via download. I really like that show and its So Cal references. As Derek commented, working at the beach is so  The O.C.  Let’s see ifanything interesting happens this summer.     I really want my schedule for work settled so that I know if I can see  Anti-Flag  at the Roxy.     So like I went drinking with the Posse (Derek, Jon, Andy) at the  Newport Brewing Co.  It was good times. Then we hung out at my place for some more beer.I kind of want the Lakers to lose in the finals... riots!!! LA is so about rioting.
