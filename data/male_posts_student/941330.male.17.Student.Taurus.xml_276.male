(damn that's so hard for an average 3000-pound car to do.) aren't suv's so awe-inspiring, reaffirming your wavering faith in the power of machines to run over animals? however, whenever you interview the typical suv owner, what is it about their precious hunk of scrap metal do they praise so lustfully? "it's soo big! i can fit all my kids and groceries and three-boob blow-up dolls!" shit, because you know, a minivan with 8 more miles to the gallon totally cramps your style. "it's so tall, i feel sooo secure!" yeah, that 7 foot, 4500-pound v-8 really keeps the accents and corrolas of the world safer at night. "it's such a good value for all its space and strength!" that's right, a cozy $10,000 profit margin for avaricious suv-makers won't stop me from saving money on my explorer, no sir!   so to every jerkoff i mentioned in this little rant (yes you too, zz top), i say graciously...go slap yourselves in the uvula, idiots.  edit 9:31 PM: haha, something rather apropos to the subject matter...   urlLink
