Too many Singaporeans, especially the youth, complain about Singapore. Lets talk local. I am local. I complained and mocked the system. Sure there may be faults within our political system, but which country is an exception to this? Faultlessness is an impossibility where mortals are concerned. Singapore, for most of us is all we know. ALL... that we know to be home. Too many times have we seen snazzy journalists with their ironic wit scoff at and mock the government subtly. Too many times has the older generation done the same. Our parents, grandparents, Gen-X. Would you pick a fight, or find fault with your parents to look cool coz your older brother was doing it? It's the same thing.  This is my call. That we edify instead of tear down. Sure, an individual wonâ€™t destabilize the government. But many ants can lift the elephant. Let's not mock our Government and it's policies unless we have genuine reason. And even then, there are appropriate avenues to voice our discontent. I've said it once, hell, I've said it a few times. You never know the value of something till you lose it. Friends and countrymen, we have good governance. Treasure it.  Now, the next thing is something that I'm really fired up about. NDP was good. The commentators, especially the male had no idea what he was talking about. He was rambling. The "choir" was actually a dance troop and the script was ridiculous. Come on! The golden bird-men coming onto the field was an indication of how Singapore was a high flying country? And a couple of soldiers shifting from a standing position to a kneeling position in a wave was an indication of how we work together harmoniously? I mean, at LEAST link the repeated Singaporean catch phrase to the appropriate formation. I must qualify however, that the NDP was valuable. Yes. It gave me a good laugh.  IDOL! ARGH! TRASH! BULLSHIT!  Dick Lee, well, he's just a dick. The girl has the freaking lamest, driest humor around. And the dude sitting at the end of the table? Shit man, he's so freaking stoned, if I hit him with a stick, he wouldn't look any worse or more dead. And you know what he said to the overly emotional nervy-crying girl? "Don't worry, there's all the time under the earth.". UNDER THE EARTH? HE SHOULD FREAING BE FREAKING UNDER THE FREAKING EARTH! That's an UNFORGIVABLE linguistic error on the part of a judge. And what was that about the maat having an attitude problem? Bullshit man. He sang well. What's YOUR PROBLEM? A couple of judges behave like they've got a cactus up their ass, the way they behave. Dick Lee? He's got a dick up his ass. He was soooo totally jacked by that dude with the flower. He was like "You're lucky that that flower on your jacket's artificial coz if it were real, it would have died". And the dude went "but the flower IS real" to which an embarrassed  dick  made a  small  attempt to save his  skin  by qualifying, "oh... no wonder it looks  bent ". BBBAAAHAHAHAHAHA! Dick got jacked. Fool.  Olivero dissed me the least. I hope there's hope in him. If not, the panel's just made up of a flopping dick, a barren bimbo, a has-been rockstar, and a linguistically deficient zombie.
