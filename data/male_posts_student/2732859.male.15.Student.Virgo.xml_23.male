He really knows what he is talking about and has deep thoughts (unlike some other people we know).  I think that he was America's Greatest President.  He brought a new hope to this country and optimism.  He worked for the job, it wasn't handed to him.  He was just a poor kid from Arkansas who grew up to be a 2-term President.  It is moments like this when I hate term limits.    "There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America."-  President William Jefferson Clinton
