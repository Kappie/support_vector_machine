Straight from the Devil's loins, they traverse the earth and our living rooms, spreading their demonic saliva, proving the irony of the human immune system. Living with a cat has inserted several phrases into my daily vernacular. The top 5 most common phrases I now use are:  1. Get off me! 2. Get out of there! 3. Stop drinking my milk! 4. Stop eating my food! 5. Where is my gun??  I hate cats.  Dearest Emily, I provide for you the essence of my date with Marc last week. What I can remember:  Thursday night, Mr. Marc picked me up from school and gave my friend, Dan Reed, (more on Reed later) a ride to the gas station. I made a poor decision and watched The Day Before Yesterday. I find dramas far too stressful. I cannot watch other people get hurt, unless it's Jim Carrey, only then from which I derive great pleasure. Not because he's funny, but because he's turned into an asshole. After the movie, he (Marc, not Jim Carrey) and I returned to his ginormous house in Pittsballs, I mean Crapford, I mean I HATE ROCHESTER. I enjoyed the opulence for a few hours and went home.  Do you ever hear the phrase "nice guys finish last?" Only "nice guys" say this, and it's usually in the middle of a really long boring story over some white-bread-and-mayonnaise dinner at Applebee's. Nice guys, with nice parents, from nice towns with nice cows are the inspiration of my new chart. In my chart, I compare my ideal man and everyone else. All examples are taken from my real relationships, specifically from both the drab and dreamy young men I have dated in the last two years.

Friday, I went to Pablo Desayuno's house again, ran into Senor Alejandro Cross, then we went to Oxford's where he plied me with liquor. It was delicious. Saturday I went to Monsieur Nellis' improv show and I now regret not going to all of his past shows. Paul-hilarious. Paul's eyebrows-intense. Highlight of the night: (other than getting to sit next to Big Al) is getting up on stage and playing the part of Paul's date. Funny enough, I've thought about it before, but I never imagined it would happen on stage. I serenaded Big Al with an original love song "You are my little turtle" and he returned the favor by giving me the biggest bong hit in the world. I coughed so much I felt my ureters rocket through my womanly area and out of my body. They landed on the couch and now Big Al has a new scrunchy. Took the tour of the new hippy pad, all four minutes of it. Wouldn't be complete without a broken window, n'est-ce pas? Bam! Done and done!  I have learned to accept my transformation into white trash as an inevitability. So today, I skipped work, wore mismatched clothing, and headed to Walmart. Did I even brush my teeth today? I sink into my new Rochesterian identity without fear because I know in August, I will return to my city - a place where people know that guacamole is not supposed to look like green toothpaste and shouldn't come out of a gun.   Me:  There is a tombstone for a two-day old baby in this cemetery. It's not even worth it! A two-day old is just a clump of cells.  Luke:  You sound like an abortionist.  Me:  I give abortions to women who aren't even pregnant. That's how much of an abortionist I am.
