I don't care what anyone says, Band Camp is way fun... especially if you're in the drumline.  We *know* how to party... especiall when Tyler is trying to act black, which is often, and always hilarious.  I'm gonna miss all the graduated seniors though... Allison, Matt, Jason, Bjorn,  you guys were great.  Thanks for the fun times (and the duct-tape-the-sophomore-to-a-tree night).  I finally wrote down my life story... it's not that long, only 11 pages, but I didn't go into detail so that I'd be able to share it w/ people... and my life's only been interesting since 9th grade anyway... yeah... :- It's now been 3 months since I began dating Mandy... and what a great 3 months those have been... Mandy, I love you, and I always will :-)  School starts in what, 2 weeks? And it's on a Wednesday too! WTF is up with that?  That means we might actually have to do something on that Friday... gross.  So yeah... it's Sunday.  Mandy's in Minn., Laura's in Colorado, my dad's in Baltimore, it's been just me and my mom *shudder* since Thursday.  Today has been especially boring... I watched Deep Blue Sea for the 3rd time in as many days.  Of course, the Red Sox never make it on TV around here, so I can't even watch those games. *sigh*  Oh well... I can smell food cooking downstairs... so I think I'm gonna go eat.  Nic  Mood: Bored, but happy. Music: Politik (Coldplay)
