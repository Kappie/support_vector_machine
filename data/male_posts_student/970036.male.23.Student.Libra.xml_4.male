I woke up this morning all gung-ho about creating an HTML masterpiece, but a quick search through  urlLink Google  for tips pointed out that tables were for losers, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) were the way to go.  Whereas I was once filled with joy, fondly recalling caffeine-fueled nights hand-typing page upon page of code simply to indent a paragraph, those joyous memories have now been replaced with a deep sense of shame and wasted youth now that knowledge of CSS has entered my grey matter's lexicon.  So, fuck it, I'll just use the templates provided by  urlLink Blogger .  Oh, how times change.     Currently listening to: Genuine Childs - Childs Play
