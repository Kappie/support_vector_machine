I can't say much has changed in the past couple of months. I'm still going for my GED, though, somehow or another, I may be able to get my diploma simply for passing the GED test. You won't hear me complaining at all, but I'm not certain it's the best thing for me. I'm not certain if I'm academically deserving of a high school diploma. Will future jobs begin to expect out of me, things that I can't give them because of this? Speaking of jobs, I applied at Walgreens and Hollywood Video in the past week. If I'm not mistaken, they're holding tests at the Career Center next week, so I don't believe there will be any laps in schedule, should I be hired to work any either of the aforementioned locations. It's going on midnight now, thought, so I guess I'll be going to bed now. Goodnight everybody!
