Indeed, it was so, the film dubbed "Dodgeball" by the neighboring peasants of yon village was not to be seen. Like a travelling troupe, it had packeth up and moveth away.      He was of much perplexedosity, but would not leave, lest the fair maiden Aubrey arrive and not see him. Catastrophic events would rain amuck did that happen. Instead, the Spencer leanth against a wall and re-read his copy of the Shizno News, issue of the number fifty.      Within fifteen minutes (since he had arrived at the time of 11:10 or so), an automobile parkth, and out did come the lady Aubrey. The two discussed the situation of not seeing Dodgeball on yonder boards, and thought about what they might do in alternation. They settled on watching the film Spiderman 2. The Spencer hadth already seen the movie, but as it was long in time and full in entertainment value, he agreed wholeheartedly.      As the film played, not much did the Spencer nor Aubrey do. The air conditioning, on the other hand, did more than its share. This did not ruin the movie, however, as both Spencer and Aubrey enjoyed it fully. By the time the movie was done, the lady and the Spencer were beginning to turn a most noble shade of blue.      As they exited the theater, with feet of blue and shivers playing havoc on their ability to stand straight, Aubrey remembered that she needed to call her mother, and promptly went outside. Spencer did remind her that yon pay phone was inside. Both of them. He pointed out yon smallish sign saying "Phone". The lady Aubrey made the call, and the two of them went outside and stood awkwardly on the curb, waiting.      As the mother arrived, the two bode farewell, and parted, Spencer walking the 15-minute walk back to his castle, where he consumed a most delicious peach. Mmmm, mmm.
