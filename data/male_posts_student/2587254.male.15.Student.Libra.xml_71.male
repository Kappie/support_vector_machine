Well while surfing blogs just now......I came across Gavin's. His last few days have just seemed so rough. I'm just thankful that he's got back to his senses now. I mean.....with his new gift of being able to "see" into Spiritual Realm....can sound so freaky. I just wanted to say Gavin man....you got guts to be usin' that gift. If I were in your shoes, wow would I have fear at some times. Props man.... maad props.  On another note.....I mean I guess the person I helped on Sunday hasn't totally slipped my mind yet. I just hope the assignment I helped her on will be alright....also I just hope that her life will improve period. I guess this is just like a "reflection/thoughts" part I'm adding in.....never really done this before. But yeah...you know who you are out there....your life is in God's hands no worries.  Yeah so I thought I'd add that....not much else to say. I just hope that those two things mean something to the people I'm writin' to. Lates. (Wonder how Josh is doing with his Buddhism exploring w/ why people believe in Buddhism).  Oh yeah Gavin...read March 23rd's Our Daily Bread....might give you a little bit of encouragement there buddy.
