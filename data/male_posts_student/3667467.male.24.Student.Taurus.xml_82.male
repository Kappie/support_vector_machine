Today we "introduced" ourselves to the class, where we have your forty year olds, your twenty year olds, your sixty year olds, your parents (not YOUR parents, but people with kids, in fact one guys wife was going into the hospital tonight for induced labor) and your people that came in thinking it was the economics class next door. The first person to introduce himself was a guy who, instead of just giving his name and occupation like the rest of society expects of him, spoke for ten minutes about how he came from Senegal and then moved to China for a year with a scholarship, had to learn engineering in Chinese AND Chinese at the same time, then excelled in his grades so greatly that he was able to get another scholarship to learn English and then come to the United States. And had he spoken last, we would have been very proud of him. Instead we all gave each other glances as if to say "I hope I'm not going next." "I have nothing to say. This guy won." "Shut up already, we're impressed, leave us alone." "This is only supposed to take a minute; I have to go soon, I have a baby on the way dammit!" We hope he doesn't talk again for the rest of the semester.
