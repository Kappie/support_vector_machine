At 12:30pm, I finally found someone to go out wif! Yay!!! We decided to go to Jurong Entertainment Centre to catch a movie and play pool.   We were supposed to meet at 2:15pm, but as u all noe, most typical Singaporeans are always late. The movie, Troy, was starting at 2:30pm, so both of us were rushing out and stuffs. I reached there at 2:25pm, to my surprise, my fren wasn't there yet. When he reached, it was already 2:40pm, and when we entered the cinema, it was 2:45pm. We missed the first 15mins of the show! OMG! Haha, but it was a 2hr and 43mins film, so the first 15mins wasn't gonna make much of a difference. Overall, Troy was one hell of a bloody show. I still can't understand why it isn't rated as NC16, but it was good. I enjoyed it man although most of the "heroes" died in the end. I'm not gonna say who, cus I dun wan those who haf not watch the movie to noe. I'm not gonna spoil the fun! Hehe.   So after the movie, we went to KFC for dinner. Economical! $5, haha, actually not veri cheap though.   After dinner, we made a trip up to the 3rd storey, where a game of pool was awaiting us. Haha, me and my fren played around 10 games in 2 hours. It was much more expensive during weekends, like $8.80 per hour. But it was too addictive and we juz couldn't stop. Haha, I think both of us won an equal number of games. There was 1 game where I made a stupid mistake. I wanted to use the black 8 ball to hit in a red ball, but in the end, the red ball spin away and the black ball went in, so I juz felt terrible. Compared to last time, I think I've improved more. Haha, yea, so we left at 7:35pm and took a MRT home.   So here I am now writing this entry and waiting for some1 to come online and chat wif me on MSN, cus I realli miss tt person alot! Haha, not gonna tell u who. Cya! =]
