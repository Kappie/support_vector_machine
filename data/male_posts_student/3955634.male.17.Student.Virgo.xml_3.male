Many have wondered what will come next, and it appears the course is fairly simple:    A court official said Friday's decision would not overturn the Bali bombing convictions. But, lawyers representing many of the Bali attackers say the ruling will now allow them to appeal.  Democracy and due process at work? Watch for George W. Bush to find those pesky WMDs in Jakarta sometime around September. You heard it here first, folks!
