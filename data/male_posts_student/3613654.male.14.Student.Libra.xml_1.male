I read theirs and it was kinda neat! Now, I wish I didn't met them in the first place cuz now I'm stuck here with nothing or what so ever to write about. Me- what about me?? I dun noe what to write about me. There isn't anything interesting about me. I’m a boring person. There isn’t any good about me except for my school shoes(trust me, they aren’t a pretty sight!!) I’m not the richest of guys nor the most handsome of guys (that’s for sure) sexy? Maybe, just maybe! (just kidding!) Smart? Not so. But I can’t count to ten! Talented; beats me! Dun noe what I am good at. If I have given u this blog page website, it’s for sure that u noe me quite well. But if u dun, I have nothing further to say. There’s a lot of people that dislike me, if you are one of them, thanx! Thanx for making my life an exciting one. Cuz if there weren’t any person who hates me, then my life will be as dumb and boring as yours!  Myself. What about myself?? . I dun like talking about myself. I hate this sort of things where you have to describe yourself. It stinks! If there’s one word to describe myself, u noe what it is?? Well, I definitely noe what it is. No lah, just kidding. I dun noe what the word it. Juz writing all this juz so it will fill up this part of the writing column. I live a simple life. The simple of the most simplest. I dun own neither a condo nor a small cute little pony in my backyard (I don’t even have a backyard!). I am the usual suspect. I have everything what the everyday person has. Nothing fancy. Just the things I require. Life- Forest Gump says that life’s like a box of chocolate, you never know what you’ll get. Well, don’t listen to a single word he said. He is a moron! Life’s not like a box of chocolate if you noe what I mean. For those who don’t, let me tell you what it is. Honestly, I dun have a dam clue. Juz writing any sort of crap that comes into my mind juz so that my blog will be 5 sentences longer! (smart aren’t I??) Family- Well, I dun noe. Sometimes their fun, most of the time their boring. Friends- its juz another 6 letter word. Eh, wait a tick, another 7 letter word. Sorry, I stink at maths! I have a lot of friends, but I only trust 2 or 3. Others are all the same; Hypocrites. When you need them at the most crucial time, they aren’t around. Busy with their  new hip, cool  friends. They forget about you by then. Being oblivious to the fact that you were the person that had stuck by their side when they needed the help. Then when their new friends ditch them at the reception, they’ll come crawling back to you like a stray puppy asking for help and trying to make it seem as though they had done nothing to you. That is what always happened to me. Maybe you dun. If you dun, then all the best with your friendship in the futre. School- The only thing that separates me from the word fun. But sometimes it can be fun. The only thing good about school is to meet my friends. Other then that, teachers screaming their hearts out at me doesn’t create any sense of fun for me. Well, that’s life! No matter how much you hate it, you still have to go through it. Just move with the flow. Like they always say: if you can’t beat them, join them and create some serious havoc while you’re at it!( now where on earth I heard that from??) Whoah!! My, my, my. I have really written a lot! Never thought I would write this much! Hmm… u noe what? This is kinda fun! writing stuff that doesn’t make sense for half an hour is rather fun!! To the person who gave me that idea to write a blog, Thanx! K lah, that’s all I want to say. Till next time. Hope I dun forget my password and the address to this webby!!  ~Peace out!~      Crash
