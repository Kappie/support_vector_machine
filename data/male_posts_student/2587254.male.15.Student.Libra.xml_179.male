Well until my mom brought back beef from like two weeks ago. I mean SERIOUSLY you'd think you could let go of stuff that happened two weeks ago...but nope not my mom. She seems to just LOVE bringing back things that happened two and a half weeks ago and seem to be like "HAH LOOK YOU'RE WRONG!" Do I care? Not really...the only thing I really care about is if someone can come up with constructive criticism. I mean...if someone calls me an idiot and points out the reason...obvious or not I can tolerate. But when people are calling me crap like that for no reason....or one of those "reasons" that just HAPPEN to be so "obvious" it can't be told...   BULLSHIT!   ...Yeah this blog is going to get a little bit more positive....BUT HONESTLY it's so friggin stupid when I get home after watching Troy...and my mom brings up random shit from two weeks ago about how a damn gas station lane at that one stupid gas station is single lane, or for some reason the time when I thought worship wasn't that great. Yes the subjects varied that much....I mean SERIOUSLY. There are times when I can tolerate this...but when she adds in random words like "idiot," "retard" or other various synonyms for those words....yeah I can get ticked off. Is it right? I doubt it...I mean God I don't think liked it...but does he REALLY like people that ridicule others without reason or with one of those "UGH IT'S SO OBVIOUS" reasons. If it's so damn obvious help the person by explaining to him how obvious it is. Why leave a fellow soldier drag along on his wounded way when you can help him? Who cares if it's OBVIOUS that the wound isn't that severe...help the person....and not make the wound bigger by jabbing at it with a 9 inch blade....or in the argument case by ridiculing them even more. Ugh it took at least two hours before my mom finally stopped with her blabbering. Oi....two hours of pointing out random stuff that don't even relate...and when I DO come up with a relevant point it's off to subject #29103948576: Why I'm apparently a poor driver. Heh funny I don't drive since I don't have a license....makes a lot of sense. Like I said....lots of irrelevant subjects....some I laugh at in my head when she brings them out. Others I'm surprised she can bring up beef from 4 months ago.  Anyways....enough with hearing 'bout my negative b/s....the rest of my day is awesome. I always do try to live up to one of my favourite Bible passages...you know the one about how I should love my neighbours and enemies, and also speaks of how revenge is never good. Matthew 5:38-48:   An Eye for an Eye  "You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.  Love for Enemies  "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.   Anyways to start my Saturday...positively =)  I woke up today around 11am after last night from chattin' a wee bit too long on MSN. Well getting up, I was gonna practice piano, but decided to try out trombone practice for new Jazz audition song. "Caravan" by Duke Ellington. I don't know what it sounds like...so I went on Kazaa hoping for a listen. Well....apparently people don't know it either so there's 8 different songs with the same name and composer. So now I'm hoping I got the right one...and gonna figure it out on my own also haha. So by 12:25 though...I had to leave for piano...  Piano....hmm not much since I'm not doing exams. NO lesson next week =P and also apparently she wants me to start gr. 9 music. *Shrug*  Getting home...Jason got here as he needed a lift to Springbank, so we played some Underground, and I played some DDR before he came. Unlocked NISSAN 350! WHOO! Though for some reason it sucks more than the Sentra, and RX-7...meh I got it anyways for the looks lol. So after 15 minutes of that...we had to go to the Park. Picked up Lina and then we were off...  While on the car  ride....we were talking about my idea for a car washing mechanism that resembles the window washing system in your car. Yeah...my idea is to put those little black things on the sides of your car above the windows and spray the car every once in a while. Yeah after hearing some doubts...and now thinking back on it...it can't work lol.  Got to the park around 2:15...and apparently I'm not the only one that hasn't arrived =P. Carmen wasn't gonna be there for another while, and Gavin and Steph just got there. Ken had an exam so he came a bit later. So we started off with a word of prayer that I said, and then we dug in, since Carmen was gonna be 30 minutes late, and Ken was at an exam for now. Well afterwards Carmen somehow just showed up...it was kinda weird because once I turned around POOF she was there lol. Kinda like the time when out of nowhere Jason walked in my house and I just yelled "HOLY SHIT!" And so she brought sandwhiches, I brought the veggies and fruit, Josh and Becca brought cake, Lina brought drinks, Gavin and Jason brought noodles, and Ken and Steph would bring appetizers. I liked the picnic, and we actually had a decent amount of food =P. Lots of leftovers.  So after the eating, we sang some songs of praise, and then went on with lots of freetime. Some of us started playing w/ a volleyball, while others began their wars with water. While the war was going on for the first half, I was playing Gavin's guitar trying to learn some new chords. Well in the end I helped Kendrick learn a few new chords in my "broad" knowledge of the guitar and yeah he learned D and G from me lol. I didn't really get involved in the water gun fights until Rebecca shot me while I was playing Gavin's guitar. Getting annoyed with water going down my back I finally took up a bottle of water and chased Rebecca whipping water at her. Then after that ran out I quickly took my somewhat defective gun and dumped it on her, causing her to run further than I've ever seen her run before lol. The real highlitht had to be though, the triple team on Carmen lol. Josh was reloading, so she was about to run for him....er shoot but then Gavin comes from behind, grabs her so she can't do jack, and then I dumped a bucket of water on her =P. Yeah she got soaked pretty much from that....not that she wasn't already but she was whatever is beyond soaked lol. Hmm I remember the whole war though starting with Gavin totally soaking Lina, then all the girls just chased him. Wendy almost lost a contact but then I pointed out it was in her goggles that she was wearing lol. She lost one anyways though in the end. Hmm oh yeah then afterwards near then end before I had to go....  Wendy: Ok guys let's stop....we gotta go soon stop refilling"  *Starts shooting me and Gavin*  Yeah we were helpeless and Wendy shot us....and we couldn't reload since we had to go soon lol. So while we were about to leave...all of a sudden my day changed. Instead of jamming @ home w/ Gavin and Dan....well we decided to go see Troy lol. Well Dan wasn't home, so couldn't really jam w/ just a guitar and drums. So we went to see Troy.  Well I had to go home first to change, so Ken said he'd come grab Lina and me at my place. However apparently my mom seems to think that having a girl at my place while she's not there wasn't too cool....so in the end she seemed to blame me for her being late because she can't really trust me. Bleh oh well in the end we got to the movies. Ken came around the corner with a powerslide, and literally making Rebecca petrified lol. Gavin Josh and Jason were like the usual guys though......"YEAH POWERSLIDE!" Yeah I was thinkin' it was awesome too, but in the end mom drove us since Ken's plan was to drive the 7 of us in a Jetta lol. Well it was kinda my family's fault...since originally he was gonna take them to Silvercity first then come grab me and Lina, but yeah since my mom called telling him to hurry up he hurried...literally lol.  We finally got to Silvercity around 6:30 or so, where we bought tickets and milled around the mall until 7. BLAST! SC Ghost is delayed till December! However DDR Extreme is comin' out September 23rd! Can't wait for that =). That'll keep me entertained until SC Ghost =P. Well 7pm came around fast...and off to watch Troy.  Movies to look out for from previews: King Arthur, some movie about demon fighting ft. Keanu Reeves, Ocean's 12...or w/e the title's gonna be lol. So yeah...after those previews...MOVIE!  Hmm throughout movie made fun of it...lol. Well it was a good movie just that there were a lot of things that me and Jason made fun of. Like the thing of how it'd be funny if the fire burning the corpses ignited the igniter, or how "them Trojans be treadin' on A-dawg's turf." A dawg being Achilles. Yeah the movie was good though...with many sad and cool parts. I also realized Shakespeare ripped like half of Romeo and Juliet from Troy. Woman loves man from the enemy, they fight, THEY EVEN HAVE IDENTICAL NAMES! Prince Paris was the most obvious one...I mean if I were Shakespear I'd at least make the name different to make it less obvious. The movie's fight scenes were AWESOME though. Achilles apparently has a 2 meter vertical with armour on. Wow he'd rule the NBA =P. Plus he owned everyone on the battlefield...until the wussie Prince Paris killed him when he was saving a Trojan woman. That part I found somewhat lame...though the real story goes like that apparently. Bummer. Hmm plus was pretty cool with the one on one battles between soldiers to determine victory or no. Prince Paris did lose to the King of Sparta, but wussed out of the battle and then had his bro kill the King of Sparta. Oh well....yeah the movie was good...won't reveal anymore...go watch it =P.  Well getting home...yeah then it loops back to the beginning of my entry where mom began her unproductive lecture.  Meh... oh well...gotta head to sleep now. I'm thankful though that Christ at least made my day mostly enjoyable, despite the two hours of crap. But hey...2/24 hours...that's nothing. Not even 10% of my day...so I don't really care for it. Totally sucks how Calgary lost tonight though. Oh well least I can see game 7 now haha. But yeah I really wished Calgary won tonight....I mean who cares if I saw it or not I care more about if they won or not. Like my dad said I can see the highlights on the news or some sports channel =). But yeah...as you can see the rest of my day was pretty awesome. Soaking people with water, eating food, learning more stuff about guitars, and watching Troy...another flick off the checklist. Now for Garfield and Dodgeball =P..  Later.
