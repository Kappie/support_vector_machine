Yesterday I went to pier 1 imports and bought this cool chinese vase, some fake flowers, a chinese rug(really small and silk) and some incense. It was nice, I set it all up. I wanna use the incense now though. I want to smell it. I made joeks to AIsha about praying to the elphant god all night though. lol  We were on the phone til 4, a little later than last itme. And this time, she was the one who was REALLY tired, not me. Yay.  But the last like..hour and a half i sang to her, every love song i could remember. And some I couldnt. I made up this long one from the song 'aisha' by outlandish, cause i only remembered the first line. thats good  Umm..I decided it was time to get back at someone. I mena, not in a mean way, but I was talking to someone and they told me I should get back at this guy. So that I shall.  Aisha's been on the road all day, driving South to hibernate for Christmas wiht family and laptop. Good for her. I'll be here.  My aunt's baby has jaundice. And I fought out she DID have a husband, but somethign I can't say happened to him.  That's good.   I found out I have ONE more reader than I thought. So that makes 2ish. lol.  Aw, someone just said I was kind. That's sweet. I feel good. Well tonight when Leila gets off from the hospital we'll go out to bella luna i think. I love the bread there.  I'm thinking more about brazilian songs ive heard, and understand more of them. yay me. Nos manos para ou. I get what that means. And i don't know why I bother to sya it.  I should do homeowkr. But biology and english dont sound AT ALL appealing. ANd i don't wanna go to mexico, i wanna stay wtih aisha. But I'll see Juan there. We're not going to exactly the same palce, so I won't see Zelenia though. It's sad. I'm sending her a letter expalining why.   My creative energy ran out. lol Oh, I ahvent seen bertha in hours. she mightve left without her presents. *cries* Oh well...  Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. Except those heathens like me!! We can celebrate Mithras' birthday instead!! yay!!  Much love  Peace  ~alexmeister
