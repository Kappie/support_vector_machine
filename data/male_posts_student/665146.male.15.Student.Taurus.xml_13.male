Why isn't he unemployed yet?  There has to be one person who is screwed up but didn't go on the show.  "Hi, I'm Jerry Springer, our research show's that you tattoo the words, 'Property of Squirrel Master' on every animal and person you see.  It also shows that you keep what you claim to be, 'the eyes of god' in a small jar in your den.  Can you come on the show?"  "Sure, buddy..."  That, my friends, is America at it's best.  Diversity has gone to a point when the Squirrel Master is king...  Go America........Hail the Squirrel Master.......
