Since it's one of those classic movies that every movie lover should see, I decided to watch it. After about two hours of the movie, just as I was thinking that it was about to end, the screen displayed "INTERMISSION." It would only be an hour and a half more until the movie was finally over.   Anyway, after dedicating so much time to a movie (I guess it's just as long as LOTR), I was glad that it was all worthwhile. It was a great depiction of the Bolshevik revolution, and it taught me much that I didn't know. Something that I didn't understand, however, was why TCM decided to show three David Lean movies, back-to-back, spanning approximately three hours each. Who, beside my brothers, would really be able to watch  Lawrence of Arabia  at three in the morning.
