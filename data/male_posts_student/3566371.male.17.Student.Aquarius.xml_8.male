Who said boys should always fall for girls. I do like girls, but I like boys as well. Too bad I can't tell anybody. Not everyone is as openminded about things as I am. But me and Albert do have a lot of fysical contact. More than regular friends, I guess. I touch him, he touches me. He bit me, I tried to bite back (in a friendly way of course). His head was between my legs, yes, his head was leaning on something. His hands were in a certain spot and sort of carressed me there. I sat on his lap, close to stuff. I touched him virtually everywhere except for that one spot. I almost kissed him, but there were other people and so he doubted and turned away just in the nick of time. Well, how do get that with a straight guy? It just happens more or less. You need to carefully build these things up. Suggest things, but in such a manner so he doesn't know wheter your serious or not. Sit next to him and move a bit closer. Go a bit deeper into subjects that could lead to things. Like the kissing thing. I hurt him, he said he wanted a kiss to make it up (of course he was joking) and I took my chance. When you're sitting in a small bus with no space and no room to sleep (we're already up for more then 24 hours), you just go lay next each other. It ends with laying on each other. But I doubt if I ever get him so far that he'd actually do something to write about. He has a girlfriend. Maybe when they break up and he's really sad. But I'm afraid that could take a long, long time. They are so happy with each other. It's horrible. They were MY friends, not each others! I want love too! I want it, i want it, i want it. But sitting here wining, isn't going to make things better, sadly enough. Girls always like me, but never love me. Horrible. Albert does think I'm cute (for a guy). Jealousy is bringing out the worst in me. Depression, hate, silence (I become very silent when I'm jealous). The depression thing is already something I should be carefull with. I've had a serious depression more than once. That, my friends, is not cool. It's weird. When I'm seriously depressed I always get the feeling I'm being followed. When I'm depressed I always get a bad thought in my head that just stays there and I can't anything else but to think about that exact thought. When I try to think about something else, it just leads back to that thought. And of course the suicide thought. Not very pleasant thought. But the weird thing is that when I take this medicine it all goes away and I become happy with no reason. Chemics decide what I think, what I feel, what I do. Diner is waiting for me, so'll leave. Bye for now
