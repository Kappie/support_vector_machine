I stole 2 houses worth of stuff while scamming it was the best thing i had done while playing on this shard hehe.  I also stole many different things.  I also scammed someone by doing a little trick thing kinda hard to explain seeing as you guys dont even know what happens or what i am talking about lol so i wont take my time explaining.  I also watched the movie mystic river today, i think it was an excellent production done by Clint Eastwood and Sean Penn and Tim Robbins were both EXCELLENT in it.  I did find one part disturbing it was when a kid finds out that his friends killed his girlfriend so he punches one of them in the face about 20 times and then gets to the other one and kicks him in the face about 7-8 times, i kinda felt like i could feel it, it kinda startled me but i dunno.  The rest of the movie i loved and i believe was very well played out.  I think i am going to goto bed now and tomorrow i will go out with my friends to the river finally getting out of the house after getting shitfaced at russells haha.  Well im out  Chris  Going to bed
