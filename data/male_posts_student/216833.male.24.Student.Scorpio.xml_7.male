Some how the icy air filling up my lungs makes me feel more alive than the smoggy filth that is Dallas summer air.  On Monday the talk in the office was "Oh I hope the roads aren't bad!", and "Well, winter is finally here."  In Dallas, there is no winter.  There are three day periods in the Winter months where it happens to get below 40 F. My decrepit self spent most of the week at home or at work.  Not really talking to much of anyone esp after Wednesday when I lost my front tooth.  I find it very disheartening.  I know I shouldn't care what people think, but it just brings back the insecureities of jr. high and that's really what I hate about it.  I feel exposed, almost naked.  I have found comfort in the pages of William Sutcliffe's second novel "Are You Experienced?"  So far a great book.  I have to stay I really don't like to put it down.  Almost through with the book, when I am done, I will post my thoughts in their entirity.  So far, I am really ejoying it.  I think I am starting to cheer up.  I am totally looking forward to spending the next week with mimi's dad in California.  I think I am gonna go up in the mountians and do a little hiking.  There is a scooter shop in Sacramento called Vespa Haus that I want to check out.  I need to buy a little something for the bike so that will be fun.  Someone other than old man Garner.  And I am totally going to hit the record stores in Berkly and SanFran.  Maybe go fishing at the Delta.   Anyways.....I will try to post on here more frequently.  Till then, all my love.
