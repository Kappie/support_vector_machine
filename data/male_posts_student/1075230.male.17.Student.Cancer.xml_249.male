Though my pants were soaking afterr Jade's surprise attack... grr.. :P  It was great to see (almost :P) everybody there.  And it was a terrific day involving pictures, presents and cross-dressing.  ...they made Kas and I do dares before opening presents... "Why don't you guys choose truth?"  "...because we're being filmed."  :D  -ArV
