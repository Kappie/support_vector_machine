The battery has less than one block left, and it won't charge the damn thing. It makes me mad.  So I made some slight changes to the layout of the blog, the other one was so boring and plain. This one is a little more intriguing. I still have some things I have to do on it though, some colour changes, backgrounds changes etc. I will fiddle with my web design power.  I have a massive headache at the moment, and it doesn't want to go away. After I finish this post I am going to take some more pills and I am heading to sleep. (I just had Deja Vu of typing that.... weird..)  So my holidays are set back one more day because I decided to cover a shift for an agent at work. So I have to work at 8:30am tomorrow. Only until 5pm though, so it isn't too bad. This way my cheque will be a little nicer than it would have been originally. Plus my vacation pay is going to be exhausted and I believe it's almost at $200. Couldn't have picked a better time for this whole paid vacation type deal to come about.  Well I suppose I am going to cut this one short, I am tired, headachy and feeling annoyed. I guess it was a little less than 2 hours for tonight's downtime. If it were any longer than I wouldn't have posted this.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Two more days of having my hair, then 75% is going to be swept into the garbage. *Sigh* my head is going to feel so naked..
