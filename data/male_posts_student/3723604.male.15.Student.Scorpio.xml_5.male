On a lighter note, I've started a new diet, which was going great until about an hour ago when I had dinner.   Throughout the day I ate (sparingly, mind you) celery, a peach, tuna and a hand full of marshmellows (the mini ones). So far so good... then comes dinner. I had a bowl of rice, stir fry and french fries (the ones you cook in the oven) and I've been regretting it ever since.   Tomorrow I might have to cut down on some of the eating, just to make of for today. Dammit!  -reb
