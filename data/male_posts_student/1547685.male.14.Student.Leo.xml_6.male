It talked about having friends that will help you instead of asking you for answers or telling you to go steal something for them. I would say i have pretty good friends, but the only thing they do thats bad is ask me for answers b/c they forgot to do their hw or they were to lazy. I would say that its really hard sometimes to say NO because they're your friends and you want the best for them. After that was advisory where we wrote this stupid story to try to get candy. I thought that was really weird, but it did waste time which was the main objective of advisory. Then came P.E. where we saw a video on lacrosse. IT was like 20 years old! I already know how to play so i just sat there and acted like i was learning something. O yeah also in Weights we played reverse kickball. It was really fun, but the only thing is that since im A period thats about all we get to do. In other classes they get to go to Qzar, go bowling, play tennis, go on hikes, and do other stuff, but we cant do any of that b/c A period is at 7:00 in the morning. Thats what i really hate about A period but i guess its okay since i get to go next year for Health and guess who the teacher is....... Mr Ecklund, my teacher for weights.
