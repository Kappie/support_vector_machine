Or is our past eaten by the landoliers? Or does time just sit there after we move on to the present, waiting for us to return?    I then began wondering about "time lines."  If we are on a time line then we must be moving forward.  Which begs the question, are we all in the present? Well, if we are all on a time line we can't all be in the present.  Whoever is at the front of the line is in the future when we are in the present but we are in their past.  Also, logically if we are moving forward on a time line then we should be able to run backward to get to the past.  However we won't know we are in the past because it will be wherever we are's present time.  We should also be able to run forward into the future.  If we are actually moving forward then there is momentum.  Whenever we hit a snag in the time line, time stops for just a tiny second.  Some people stay with the present and the pause for a slight second also.  A few others are "out there" and when time stops the momentum of their bodies is still moving.  Therefore, they run into walls or trip and are knocked back into the present.  This explains why people are a little clumsy...hmm...andrea, megan.    I have figured out the answers to time travel!  I should be published somewhere.  I am a genius.  Well, maybe not but if you disagree then the only way to explain your clumsiness is that you actually do run into things and fall over them.
