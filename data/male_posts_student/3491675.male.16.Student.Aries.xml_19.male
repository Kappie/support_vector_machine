So guess what i forgot to mention a couple of day's it was jim morrison's anniversary on the july the 3th, i remembered yesterday when i was listening to light my fire, when i suddenly remembered hey it was his passing anniversary on the 3d. Today today what a day not really, it's just been bleaker.I spent all this morning remembering a Tragic Fairy tale from when i was younger,yes there are such things as tragic fairy tales,i finally remembered all the datails to it, the story is basically like the little mermaid, but the differences are the sea hag isn't evil, she doesn't interfeare, actually she just makes bargain's, the bargain the mermaid made was that she also had three day's to get the prince's heart and if she didn't onthe mornng of the 3rd day she would turn into bubbles and disipate into the wind. So when she goes to the prince she tries and the prince by his own will falls in love with another girl. And so the prince invites her to go with him and his new lover to go to the sea in his boat.so when her sisiter's find out,(dady doesn't rescue her)so they  sneak into the sea hag's cave and look for how to break the spell, so in the morning on the 3rd day they tell her she must drive a knife through his heart in order to break the spell, so she finds herself in his room with a knife in her hands, she looks at his face nad finds herself unable to and heads up the deck where she waits for morning and her sister's ask her why didn't she, she responds I can't kill him i love him to much, i would ratehr turn into bubbles and be around him fore ever, than never be with him, and so it ends with her turning into bubbles and dissapearing into the wind. This i think was one of those stories that gave me an early belief that there is no such thing as Happily ever after, and this was about when i was 7 or 8, it's amazing what i can remeber from when i was younger.
