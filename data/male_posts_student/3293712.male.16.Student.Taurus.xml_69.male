Also, since Hawkeye's got a new car, it'd be great to do a lot of street racing and get it smashed up as fast as possible. My idea, at least.  Also, my personality type is Movie Star, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Taking the inkblot test revealed that my subconscious mind is ruled by curiosity. I liked that inkblot test.  Now for some intellectual banter: Most people really think of themselves as being better than others. Not necessarily because they are prejudiced against others, but basically because of differing morals. While everyone's moral base is about the same, finer points can be skewed drastically. People generally try to acheive their own individual morals, with varying levels of emphasis on differing points depending on the individual. Admiration comes from another person being closer to your morals than yourself.   I've a lot more on that, but that about sums it for the most part...  Also, John's website proves that John Kerry is NOT superior. Basically, what it's saying is that if the words 'John Kerry' were removed from the ballot and replaced with 'not Bush,' he would get the same amount of votes. Most people aren't pledged to him because they like him, they're pledged because he's not Bush. The two-party system... another horrible downfall of American politics. Seriously, I was watching the British House of Commons last night, those guys rock. Tony Blair is the greatest politician I've seen, even if he is too liberal. Okay, maybe I'm just caught in the moment. Still, Tony Blair is really cool.
