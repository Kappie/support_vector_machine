I never actually  let her post but yah, when i was gone she wrote a post without telling me.*Mutters about older sisters*Hopefully it won't happen again. lol. Also despite the fact that people voted for me to be admin, i do not wish to be admin so let ryan do it or somebody other than me. Ohh yay i got my hair cut and my ears pierced whooo hooo! I feel happy. My internet time is going to be limited becuase my dad got back from south america and he hates it when i go online so i only get like, 10 min. a day. gtg see yah
