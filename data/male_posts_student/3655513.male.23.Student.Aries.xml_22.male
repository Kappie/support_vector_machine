"nigritude ultramarine" was the word invented. This consortium invited web denizens everywhere to use the "best search engine enhancement" that they could in order to get the highest spot on Google's search; eg. when you type in "nigritude ultramarine" on Google, you want to be the first website listed. Apparently there is a huge market out there for people who "optimize" your website to be more search engine friendly.  Well the gent who won the contest for the month of July is none other than Anil Dash. Anil lives in NYC and is a famous blogger and online media mogul-type. All he did to win is ask the people who read his blog to link to his page with a link on their sites that read "nigritude ultramarine". *laugh* How simple was that? Other people reprogrammed quads of HTML and virtual scripts, and all to be beaten by a blogger and his fans.  This brings me to two topics. Advertising and consumer capitolism. We live in an age where the almighty dollar rule western society (meaning North America, western europe, and any other post-industrial-non-socialist states). In order to survive the battleground of corporations vying for your hard earned case, you have to understand the methods said corporations use to obtain that cash from your wallet. Their primary weapon is advertising. Whomever has the best advertising wins. If you are old enough, you will most likely remember a time when Reebok was a much more trusted brand for sports products above any other. Or Adidas before that. But in the mid to late 1980s that change. Nike signed an endorsement contract with a basketball superstar named Michael Jordon. Now Nike sits upon a throne in the sports marketing industry that is unlikely to topple to any usurper due to the prestige marketing has brought them ever since. Another example aside from prestige is memorability. How many of you can hum the original McDonalds jingle that was on TV and radio for almost 40 years? How about the new McDonalds jingle "lovin' it"? (The new jingle by the way was written by Justin Timberlake for the fast food chain) Think of how familliar you are with jingles or ads off the TV ("zoom, zoom" for Mazda, the "NBC" tones for the TV network, etc.) and compare that with your familiarity with cultured things or even popular things. (eg. The latest top 40 music list, or famous musicals, operas or symphonies) Advertising is most likely one of the most powerful forces in your life. So is it really a surprise that kids these days want the latest $300 Nike runners, or need $400 for a PS2 and all the trimmings just so they can hear that cool sony "vvvvmmmmm" sound when they start their game console up? Advertising = mass choice in our common social structure (that is capitol consumerism).  On that note, I have received my first official entries to my advertising competition. Keep the photos coming everyone. In case you missed my last entry, I'm looking for digital pictures of you (or your family and friends) holding up a clearly readable sign that reads "Rooster's Blog". I'm looking for photos of all types. Funny, intense, creative, sexy, etc. Most importantly I want the photos to grab people's attention. I will be using them for advertising and the best entries will end up on the web.  So no holds barred, send in your pictures to imtherooster@gmail.com and get your post on the blog. Happy picture-taking.  Rooster
