As we came back to the house, I watched the branches fall from two palm trees.   From afar, you only saw majestic branches falling, one at a time.  The destruction was brilliant...withering and slow death is not exciting, but arbol armageddon, where the plant sheds its skin for seemingly no reason, crying out against whatever internal wrong plagues it...you cannot help but stop the car and look.  I thought nature had gone wrong.  My grandmother didn't understand, she just wanted to get home.  I was too frightened and too thrilled to move.  Something was fighting, and its last gasp was envigorating.    Only on closer inspection were the tree trimmers evident, perched 50 feet in the air, trimming the lush foliage back.  They do it because rats get up in the trees and destroy them.  It makes the trees look like in-use condoms.
