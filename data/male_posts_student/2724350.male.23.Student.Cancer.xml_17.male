But, I was actually looking forward to the weekend cos the adventure outing at Sentosa me and several others of my committee had organised is COMING SOON! I'm actually looking forward to having fun at Sentosa! However, it seemed like the response wasn't very good and we actually had to coerce them to go. Sob sob...cos we really spend alot of time planning for this outing! Hope it will turn out well.  Anyway, just went for a BBQ at one of lecturer's condo. A few of us actually got lost trying to figure out how to get there. It was meant to be a farewell party for a lecturer who will be leaving ur soon. It rained halfway while we were still BBQing and worst still, there was no shelter for the pit and the poor guys BBQing had to tolerate being rained on while trying to cook. Such irony. Although I never really ate anything much, I sorta enjoyed myself over there, meeting up with a few seniors and finding out their latest "development" at work and also doing some bonding with my juniors. Well...you could say that it turned out pretty well.  Been trying to study consistently recently cos I dun wanna end up getting average results everytime. My goals for myself this semester is to get at least a 'B' for  ALL SUBJECTS !(Hope I can accomplish that!)
