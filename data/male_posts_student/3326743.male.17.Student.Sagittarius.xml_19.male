Lord willing, I'm going to my last day at work for this summer in just a few minutes.  Pray that I have made a good, Christ-honoring impact and that I would continue to do so.  I've finished 4 chapters of Desiring God and with each chapter I become more convinced of how little I have sought joy in God but have done works out of a mock pious attitude as if God was benefiting from me doing them.  Like I'm doing God a favor!  How carnal!!  Yet through it all God is becoming more and more precious to me.  He is the pearl of great price.  Pray that it doesn't rain on Tuesday and that we continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  See ya.
