Is it simply being happy around someone, is it thinking about them all the time, or is it simply that if they asked you you'd go out with them? Well, although I may not have the answer, I know what I mean by fancying someone, and it's a particular feeling I get. Anyway, thinking about about 3 people all the time. Hooray for me. Well, no. It's not actually that fun, it's quite guilt-inducing. However, it's so me-like I have to laugh about it.  Anyway, can't think of much else to write.  Quote of the day: " Every day we'll remember that night, And the vow that we made. A heart full of love  (She was never mine to keep),  A heart full of you, The words are old, but always true  (She is youthful, she is free).  Cosette, Cosette...  (Love is the garden of the young)  I saw you waiting, and I knew...   Waiting for you, At your feet.  (Let it be.)  At your call  (Let it be.)   For it isn't a dream,   (A heart full of love,)   Not a dream after all.   (This I give you this day.)"  From   Marius + Cosette   from   Les Mis, Act II, after Empty Chairs at Empty Tables   Love, Jon Roskilly
