O.O I came online and the first thing CQ told me is that the results are out. Guess what? I got into PJ! YAY!! HaHa! A lot of cats also! CQ for one. Hmm. WQ came online, and deliberately delayed his checking. Ergh! Even CQ washed his hands off WQ!  After that and breakfast, we went down to cut hair. Sigh. My hair is badly multilated. Even ducks are appalled at hairs being sniped by catty cats-ducks! Hmm. After that, I went back home to wash mah hair. You can't expect me to go out with bits of hairs stuck in my head! I need to shampoo twice to get rid of the itsy-bitsy hairlets. After washing, I went out to meet mah friends at the basketball court near WQ's house. Well, I was late. I told them I am gonna be late anyway, so meow moo.  Hmmm. That WQ lied to me, said he's going to NYP's Business course. Of course, I didn't really believe him in the first place. I got a gut feeling he's lying. How? I dunnoe. Probably by the others' reaction, and his eyes. I can see it. Anyways, we played some game. KS, TZ, ChiYuan and ChenHui came. Hmm. We played some game, stopping to rest at 12.15 and played some more lor.  We stopped at 1. Hmm. We sat down to talk for awhile. CQ, Joyce and Gloria went home. She said "I go home and eat la. Everytime stay back to wait for Kelvin, but always in the end, didn't go home with him". I was like "What?". I never expected her to to go home with me. I never wanted her to anyway. She's free to go home anytime. I never forced her to stay with me anyway. Sigh. This is getting dangerous! Anyway, the rest of us took the bus to Causeway Point to eat lunch.  Yeah. Me, WQ, PY, HM, TZ, KS, CY and CH went to eat lor. I paid WQ back 1 moolah. Heh Heh. Anyway, I ended up telling PY and HM things. That WQ la. Go and bring up that topic. Nothing better to talk. Hm. WQ's observations were really that accurate lor. I wonder why others didn't see it, they were obvious. I don't mean  all  his observations. Most of them anyway.   After lunch, we went to play pool. Yes. Thrice in a row. HaHa. TZ treated us all, so thankies to him. Hmmm. Me and WQ played against PY and HM. Hmmm. Soon, we changed partners la. Ayiah. HM left early lor. We stopped playing at 4:30.  I walked to Marsiling with TX, KS, WQ and PY. We sent WQ off first, after that I took the MRT and 913 bus back. I came home, bathed, ate dinner and watched TV and was online ever since I finished bathing. HaHa. I am now listening to my playlist. Back Here by BBMak is playing. "There's a feeling I want you to know, you are the one that I can't let you go" Very romantic!  Even ducks must meow! I think I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
