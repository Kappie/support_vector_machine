I hope the Lakers lose, i really don't like them, and that Kobe, he's so smug--i hope he gets convicted.  Anyways, i'm in charge of the house again, my brother went over to his "girlfriend"'s house and probably won't be back.  As for Jacob, who knows, i haven't seen him in a week or so.  I need a hobby or something man, i get so bored.  And food, boy have i ran out of ideas of food to eat, makes me kinda wish i was at home and didn't have to buy my own food and didn't have to think about the meals i have to make.  It's nice to live in the city and be semi-independent, but it feels like i'm missing something...maybe i'll go start on the server.  now that i have the software to do it i think it'll be pretty cool to have a server set up for the house.  I know it's not necessary but it might be fun and i might even learn a few things along the way
