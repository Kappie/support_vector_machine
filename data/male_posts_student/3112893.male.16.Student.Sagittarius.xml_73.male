There are a few funny stories where this characteristic expresses itself at all the wrong times in public places, but there's no point in telling any of them here; besides, I've forgotten the bulk of most of them. Anyway, of the few things I thought about, one was that movie 'Good Will Hunting'. I remembered in one part Robin Williams is asking Matt Damon something to the effect of whether he's met anyone who truly challenges him or something, like a partner who's like the dudette to match all his dudeness... or something like that. That's at least how it stuck in my head.  In any event, I started thinking "hey, have  I  met anyone that challenges me in that true sense?" and then I thought for a while, as I slowly ate the clam chowder that was prepared far too hot. Finally, I came to the conclusion that the most challenging people for me to deal with are smartasses. I was then depressed by my recognition of my own simplicity because even after further thinking, the only thing that I could think of that really made me want to be better was... well, nothing except being a smarter ass than the smartass that just bested me. Perhaps it's just a phase, but if this is true (that I only need a smarter ass than me to become a better person and grow and bla bla bla), then my life is pretty damn easy in terms of finding a wife that I'll be happy with. So far it looks like these are the requirements (in no particular order):  Good Looking Intelligent Aware of general events in the world Less lazy than me Wants to have more than 2 kids (but not too many more) Doesn't mind animals Doesn't hate outdoors and finally, a smartass  When I look at that list, I think "damn, feanor, you sure you're not more picky? I mean, really, this list is really general and you must be kinda desperate to come up with such a list and then post it." and then I reply to myself "naw, I'm just a simple dude who doesn't ask for much." Then I say to myself "i.e. desperate, buddy. go and get a life, dude." to which I reply "*wimpers* *cries* *runs away* *stays gone of like 45 seconds* *comes running back screaming with a big kitchen knife and stabs the other character to death* *grins* *walks off as if nothing happened at all*." That's a pretty active imagination if I say so myself. It's creepin' me out!  Anyway, I don't even know why I wrote this thing or if it even portrays what's actually happening in my head, or if it even makes sense within it's own context, but thanks for reading it anyway.  That is all. -- Feanor
