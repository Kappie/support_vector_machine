With prelims in a month time, this isn't the most proper time to skip school.  Will be teaching archery to the participants. Hopefully they will listen to my instructions and not test my patience. Nowadays, I have a terribly short fuse.  Tentatively, archery will only take place on wednesday and thursday so I have the first and last day off... However, the camp will take place in Pulau Ubin. Which is a god-forsaken place (no pun intended) void of even the most basic services and ammenities.  Sigh...
