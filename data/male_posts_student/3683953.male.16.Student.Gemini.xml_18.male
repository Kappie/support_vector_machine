(quoting Jack from last Monday's episode of Dawson's Creek)    So now it's July 5th and in the past couple of days, I've been feeling very very very depressed. I just feel like I disappoint everyone around me, especially my mom and dad. I mean, I know I'm not exactly how they wanted me to turn out to be, but you gotta be happy with what you got...right? My dad (especially) looks at me different. I know that I said that I'd be a mechanical engineer (when I was 9), but that was a long time ago and I've changed my mind. I guess he's kind of mad because he wants me to be an engineer but I'm leaning towards being a mathematician or musician. He constantly keeps saying "Do what you want to do, don't listen to anyone else," but I know he doesn't mean it. I can tell by the tone in his voice. And then other people, its just ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....  SONG OF THE DAY: BON JOVI - IT'S MY LIFE
