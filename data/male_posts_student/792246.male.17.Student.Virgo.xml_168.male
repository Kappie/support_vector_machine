And now:  [15:28] Eric: hello moses [15:29] Sophie: *in moses's voice*hello eric, how are you today [15:29] Eric: moses speaks in blue! yay! [15:29] Eric: im good sir [15:29] Eric: ive read all five of your books [15:29] Eric: im a big fan [15:29] Sophie: that's good to hear! [15:30] Eric: genesis was my favorite though. exodus was good but didn't have the impact of the original. deuteronomy, numbers and leviticus kind of bored me at times, but i still liked them! [15:30] Sophie: ah, leviticus was a bitch to write [15:31] Eric: im sorry to hear that [15:31] Sophie: it just didn't have the OMPH that genisis had, don't you agree? [15:31] Eric: absolutely
