I mocked the Gamecube for a long time after that until I broke down and got one because of RE addiction. I haven't regretted it since. The REmake of the original Resident Evil and also Resident Evil Zero look amazing and both play really well.    However, I still don't understand why Capcom switched. Resident Evil became famous on the Playstation, where its core fanbase is. Then they put it on a platform that seemed to be targeted mainly to younger kids. The only reason I saw was the big graphics upgrade. The graphics look so advanced that, and I'm sick to say, I don't think the PS2 could handle it. But Gamecube or not, I'll buy whatever I have to in order to have my Resident Evil. However, if I find out that I had to get a 200 dollar system only for all the games to be ported to PS2, I'll be really,  really  pissed.
