Eh, if I had a car, I probably wouldn't.  So at school, not much happened.  I'm the 2nd best in my Geometry class.  I just like saying that.  I mean, its an easy class, but these kids I'm surrounded with don't know jack fuck.  You gotta earn this "3vil l33t" shirt.  At lunch, I had like 3 books on me, and I was reaching for the pasta sauce for my pasta (gigighkjkkjhdhgi DUH!!) and the shit spilled all over my shirt and binders.  Fuck!  Good thing everyone in high skool is so fucking apathetic; no one looked.  So I just wiped up and declined the offer of a free lunch.    When I finally got my shit home, I watched TV, and about half an hour or an hour ago, I started perfecting my handheld crossbow.  Like, handheld mean that you can one-hand it, have the bolts (or in my case, handle-less knives with balanced ends)  on your belt and have shield in your off-hand.  Wow, that sounds like my D player's handbook.    Anyway, the idea of shooting the knives at (impressively) high speeds rather than throwing them (which I fancy myself decent at) is quite sound.  'Course it can't penetrate a breastplate, derr.  The pull is so weak, I can take both my fingers and pull/string the fucker.  Yeah.  So the speed at which the knives go really isn't much.  But is enough so that the knife makes a satisfying *Twang-g-g-g* noise upon striking a wooden surface.  Mayhaps now that I know what I'm doing, I can commission the building of a larger, more solid model that has greater pull.    You may be looking at the monitor with a strange look upon your face (most likely also furrowing your brows) in order to figure out "Why is he doing this?".  The greatest thing to hit my little Omaha off-shoot town, off course!  Hot Topic?  I think not, prissy-pants!  The Renaisannce Fair!  Huzzah!  I have swords, a shield or two, and have worked on some banded light-weight metal armor.  All I need is a cloak, and I will look cool as shit.  Or lame as fuck, if your opinion of me is shitty.  Heh heh heh, I will look so cool.    So thats my day so far.. now that officially have control of the 'puter and no homework, I can finally look at the comics that are conveniently located on your left.  Yes, that sidebar.  Lates.
