The Book has the right mix of Jack's usual aggression with a dose of candor  modesty . India finds a special place in the Book . Jack apparently is an unabashed admirer of India and its Intellectual potential . He writes with unbridled enthusiasm his love for the country and admiration of its people ( of course with subtle snide remarks about the Bureaucracy ) . No wonder that GE turned out to be one of the Biggest "Chalo India "Drivers in the early 90's and one of the key Investor in the Country .
