Well I just got it again and I haven't seen it since then.   Today I woke up around 12 in the afternoon and started watching the brand new episode I had been downloading yesterday (eps 21-30).  Half-way through watching them I remembered about the new episode 90 and by then someone had to have already subbed(translated)it, and for sure after going to  urlLink Narutofan.com  there was a quick sub by the group sganime.    While it downloaded I watched more of the classic DBZ episodes and then after 26 minutes it was done and immediately started watching it (it was great).  I proceeded with the great DBZ episodes but a feeling came over me after watching Naruto and that was the urge to watch more!...more!  Anyways I was a good peer and shared the episode 90 until my sharing rate was more than 1.0 :-) [i use BitTornado] Then around 4:00 I started downloading eps 31-40 and still downloading right now (8:34 pm)   Oh well I'll just "surf the net" now.    Computers are useless, they just give you answers
