    
       I want to recieve feedback or questions from anyone who reads this blog, but I don't want to get any spam in my new GMail account (just in case I want to use it for real in the future).  So, what do I do?  I invited myself to join GMail.  I know, those of you without GMail will probably want to kill me.    Comments, questions?  urlLink g.experience@gmail.com
