Brit and Yentel came over, and we played a bit, but not much.  The next day, a Thursday, Rosa and I went into Brussels.  We came into Brussels by bus (an hours drive) and then took the Metro to Noord Station.  We first saw the Kings Palace.  Sorry, cameras arent't allowed in there so no pics.  Then we walked down a long hill to the Grote Markt, where we had a drink and watched the world go by.  Then we spent about an hour trying to find Manneken Pis (I don't think Rosa is very good with directions, we must have asked about 50 people where the stupid thing was, and I'm not exaggerating).  When we saw it, we went home.  Friday Lorenz and Thalia came back from their fathers' place.  We all then went over to Brit and Yentels house, where we played in the pool.  I got soaking wet.   Saturday I went to Mechelen with Nancy, Thalia, and Lorenz.  It was a lot of fun.  I bought Order of the Phoenix PB and presents for the pigs.  We saw a church and ate good food.  Fun.  Sunday we lazed around.  Bye for now!!!!!
