So school today was ok, managed to stay awake the whole day (clap clap) and kinda enjoyed the day through...  Went to Tampines area with Sherman and Chan Lun, to get several items ticked off my shopping list. Adidas Climacool, Nokia 6100 Blue cover, and a Nokia 6230 Original Graphite Keypad. Also bought a pair dri fit Nike low cut socks.  Had lunch at Yoshinoya (thanks to the coupons) and then headed to Royal Sporting House. Biggest size was only 9.5, couldnt fit my leg too well. Then we went to Sportslink. Found that the biggest size was 11.5 (-.-") and I tried on the 10.5 and 10... Found 10 to be the perfect size.. So I took it, along with the pair of Nike socks. Total, $130.75.  Took a bus to Street 44, where MobileRange is. Bought a 6100 dark blue cover, as well as a graphite original 6230 cover. Total, $43.  So let me make a tally of the things I bought this August alone (>. -Hang Ten shirts and U2 pants : $100.40 -Adidas Climacool Shoes with Nike Dri Fit socks : $130.75 -Nokia 6100 (Second-hand) : $190 -Nokia 6100 dark blue Xpress-on Cover : $18 -Nokia 6230 Graphite cover with keypad : $90 -More to come (namely a Swatch watch and a Deuter backpack) So thats $529 and counting.... eek... this is the most I've spent in 1 month..  Gonna go tight on my budget after the next few items are acquired... Damn.. Financial status going to hit the red line soon...  Will blog again later, Seeya !
