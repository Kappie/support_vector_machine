Does means that we are no longer together? -----------------------------------------------    You must be wondering what the title means rite? well here is what had happened to me.    Last night after i came back from the wonderful performance by a few Gold School Bands. I stared at the letter that he had wrote to me(above). Wondering if he is alright. Both, not knowing each other's well being. Than i remembered that i have a Gmail account to check. So off i went and checked the mails i recieved. Not much though. Than suprisingly his name was there, Daniel LAh!. He has sent me an e-mail asking for more information about next week's concert at the Botanical Garden, His school will be performing (Anglo Chinese Independent). Actually i asked him out on 18th to accompany to the concert. So i replied to his first e-mail. Once replied i checked my inbox again, Daniel has sent me a Cirque Du Soleil 'Virtual Card'. A La Nouba Virtual Card, how did he know that La Nouba is my favorite resident show?...:P, it said that he wanna apologise that he won't get to see me for quiet a long time, i got kinda shock and erm sorta confused coz why the apology heheh, his parents has minimised his usage of the internet (yeah he is apologising for not coming online regularly... O.o), he went to Ash's website and read his bloggy. He felt sorry for him and he is sorry that i wont be angry..(angry? come on i have a split personality which comes out whenever someone is irritating, turns me down regularly and etc). He too mentioned that i can ask him out and try to keep it on weekdays and he won't be staying at the boarding school for 2weeks due to his Piano exams (GOOD LUCK!). Haha its actually strange because missing someone's company is my job haha... but it seems that he misses my company... no one have ever like directly said that to me before (i blushed totally when i read that part! hehehe). Well don't worry Daniel, our religion maybe different but at least our religion have the same history. I replied to his e-mail with an apology too and i soon went on and on with the e-mail not stopping hahaha. At the end of the letter i made a confession to him. (this part i gotta cencord it cause its not meant to be put up here for safety purposes.) I kinda blushed and once the e-mail was sent i quickly closed the window and imagined nothing had happened.    The next day (Today of course), In the canteen during recess i sat with my gal frendz. I did not notice that Ern Leng sat behind me. Eliza purposely tapped his back and said hi. I blushed away. Than i keep peeking back to see him. hehehe. Than i notice that K.S. was sitting beside Mizan. Like walau! Two guys who i have a crush on is sitting near me. Suddenly the gerls asked me to look behind... so i did... And there he was...IVAN!... Those gerls were so mean! "Got two seh! hahaha"... I really really really really blushed and like Ern Leng is sitting behind me, K.S is sitting in the same row of tables with me and IVAN! is just standing at the edge of the table behind me where Ern Leng was! This made me really really really really really red! three of the most hottest/cuttest guys to me is very very near me! Than when Ern Leng and Ivan left, which made me cooled down more, the gerls just stood up and said lets go!... so i stood up and pushed the bench back suprisingly causing heheh my friend to land on her bottoms with her plate, luckly nothing left, with me tripping over the edge of the bench. I sat up properly and looked at her face, she was angry (not exactly angry...angry in a sacarstic way haha) and i looked at K.S. he was giggling and staring at me... He gave me a wink. My eyes rolled back towards her and she like gave me an angry face.. so i got scared i stood up and ran away hahaha.     After school. I went to buy some lunch for me to eat. While i was eating my class mate was spinning his basketball on his forefinger. Then a pair of hands covered my eyes. All of the sudden my plate flew onto me. All the food and gravy made my shirt dirty. Like there goes my $2 of lunch. I cleared the table and wiped away all the excess food that was on the table. Dusting away food from my uniform. Many were staring at me but i just ignored. I decided not to eat the left overs cause i lost my appetite for the rest of the day. Once i put back the plate i saw my little sister, Moon, crying. I came up to her and asked her what had happened. So she told me. I gave her a pat on the shoulder and asked her not to cry anymore. Without noticing her EX-BOYFRIEND, My ex-gawd-brother, my ex-father, my ex-bestfriend was watching me. He got angry. I felt someone looking at me so i peeked over my shoulder and there he was trying to get a fight with me (he was not near me yet k). A few of my friends asked me to go away.. but i refused cause i can't let my little sister suffer no more. Than my bestfriend, Rashid, forced me to go away. I did moved away from them... i went to the DnT block. When i was there, my ex girlfriend accompanied me to protect me cause she knows that Amirul won't hurt me in front of a girl. The other Rashid said to me that my ex girlfriend don't want me to die or get hurt. I didn't know she would be so caring. I asked her to be my protector for a while. We walked towards this strange and new office, FE HUB???, than he walked out of the canteen and called for me. He backed away when he sees a few of my friends near Mr Bruce, My english teacher and Amirul's Z-Club teacher-in-charge. I came up to him and told him what had happened and hoping that he could counsel him but instead he asked MR SIVA, the school's Dicipline Master, and made this case official. So i had to enter the General Office and write a statement... than my ex gerlfriend knocked on the window asked me to come out with the form. So i did. (lets skip this part...make me wanna cry... so stressed!) Well than i decided to withdraw the sentence but i couldn't cause that stupid Siva asked me to think twice. So i sat infront of Mdm Su, my favorite Dicipline Mistress, and wrote the sentence having the two Rashids talking to her what had happened. Once i finished Mdm Su called my sis, since my parents are not home they went to KL, and with her permission to let me go home either alone or ask her to pick me up but instead i went home with my bestfriend.     I realised that i have friends who care for me when i am in really really really really in trouble. All this time i tried not express too much of my feelings. I try to cool down and make this cooling but instead SOMEONE made it worst. Haiz... Y does it have to end with Innocents Suffering?...
