"You wonder how many votes he scared off with that testosterone festival: the taunting message, the self-righteous geographic litany of support? The Philippines. Thailand. Italy. Spain. Poland. Denmark. Bulgaria. Ukraine. Romania. The Netherlands. Norway. El Salvador.  Can you believe President Bush is still pushing the cockamamie claim that we went to war in Iraq with a real coalition rather than a gaggle of poodles and lackeys?"  So to make her happy, we have to convince people who hate us to join with us in striking down....people who hate us?  Maybe we should have tried harder to get Iran into the coallition.  Or maybe we could have got Iraq to join!  That would have been a masterstroke!  We would truly be international then!  I'm tired of her.  I'm tired of all of them.  Ignore reality and place us in danger just to score some points.  Let's rely on the self-restraint of madmen while we try to talk them down from their blood lust.
