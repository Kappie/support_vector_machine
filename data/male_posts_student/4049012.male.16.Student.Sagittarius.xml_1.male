", but it's got some nice songs [Nothingman, Corduroy, Spin The Black Circle, Immortality, Tremor Christ], in particular. And I got it for about 2 bucks. Go used CDs. And the damn thing isn't even scratched, but the cover is kinda worn, but, eh, oh well. It still plays well.    urlLink The site , in case you want to know something about Pearl Jam, etc.
