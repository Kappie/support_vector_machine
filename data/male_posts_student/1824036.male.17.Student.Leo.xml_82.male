First of all I am a little jealous of everything around me. If its mine I will let people know. And that includes girlfriends.  At this particular time Jadie and I had been going out for about 6 months. She comes back from a polka fest raving about her new friend Chad. I was like oh jeez. She gets his email address and begins to email him. In a short 2 or 3 weeks she had accumulated nearly 35-40 emails from Chad. I had concurred that she was telling him more than she was telling me so I felt shunned out of her life. I told her I didn't like Chad and that I didn't want them talking anymore. So after a little fight that a few tears were shed in she agreed to do so. About 3 days later she came to me and said that she had told him off, completely yelled at him, and blocked his emials and instant messenger.  It was only until today that I had lied about having key logs on my computer and all that stuff when actually Jadie was the last one to sign onto my AIM and I could see who all was online and who she had added to her AIM. To my surprise Chad's address was there. I questioned her about it and she said that she had blocked him. It is about 1 month and a half since this "blocking" that never took place. And in fact she owned up to talking to him over this whole time. In that month me and Jadie have become less and less involved with one another. Less romance, less hand holding, and all that gooey jazz.   I really really want to dump her, but I know better. I know Jadie. She would go nuts and so would I if that happened. So I wont think irrationally about that one. No dumping will be involved. But I am also tired of the lies. I tell Jadie everything. I am so sweet to her and I get what in return? Chad Boyce? No thank you! I am tired of playing the proverbial "Atlas" in this relationship. I have 2 options, make Jadie shoulder a load for a while while I collect myself...or just pass that heavy ball I call a responsability....onto Chad
