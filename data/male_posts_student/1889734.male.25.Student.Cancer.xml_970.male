The council overwhelmingly endorsed a proposal that would require Wal-Mart and other retailers to show that their nonunion discount stores would not hurt jobs, wages or businesses in the surrounding area, as union leaders and competitors claim.    Can I translate?  COMPETITORS are complaining that COMPETITION is hurting them.  And that requires government intervention?
