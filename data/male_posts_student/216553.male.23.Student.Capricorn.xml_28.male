I've always been envious of Apple's iPhoto software, but this thing is comparable, if not better! So go and grab it over at:  urlLink http://www.picasa.com/google/?promo=hpp1     You can thank me later ;)    Soooo....what else is new? Well, I've been studying quite a bit of neurology this weekend, and am getting close to putting most of this stuff all together. And I've been thinking lately, as I've been doing more and more neurology this semester, I'm actually considering it as a career now. I'm not sure if I'm smart enough to become a neurosurgeon, but I think I can get into Internal Medicine, and specialize in neurology if anything. Bah, who knows what will happen.    Ok, that's all for now folks. Bye bye.    P.S. JL...guess who has a Gmail account now!? ;)
