Though I hate the concept of blogging in general, the manliest man I know (Jeremy) and the geekiest guy...ever (Casaburi) have both recently started blogging, thus, by a combination of blogging and the transitive property, I can simultaneously be geeky and manly. For all the 1s of readers out there who may actually see this, I applaud you for returning back to the disguised mass emails that all of you so gallantly tried to avoid, then to filter, then to outright reject from your mail server to prevent server overload and blatant destruction by stupidity. That's all for now...it's a cloudy overcast day in lovely PV, giving me a chance to go outside without melting into a vampiric puddle. Not that I will (go outside), but hey, the option is available.
