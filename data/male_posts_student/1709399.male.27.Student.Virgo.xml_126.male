TOI  urlLink claims  to be No.1 from the NRS Survey while HT  urlLink Claims  to be the No.1 according to ABC (Audit Bureau of Circulation ) survey in which TOI hasn't participated.                                            It was disgusting to read the Chest thumping in TOI which claims itself as the Newspaper of the elite  Intelligent (when its actually not ) and their self-gloating.. I don't read the HT much to comment on it . Its unfortunate that such cheap journalism has become a common occurence in these days when India is emerging as the World's knowledge economy.
