So far, he's been champion for 33 days with winning over $1,100,400. That's more than 99% of people win on "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?".  Nobody stands a chance against that guy. Seriously, today he had $50,000 at the end while the closest person to him had about $6,000. It's not even a contest. I wonder if they'll let him play Jeopardy forever. That would be totally sweet.
