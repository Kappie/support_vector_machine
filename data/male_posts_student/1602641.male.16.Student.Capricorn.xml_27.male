Now look at all those stupid Deaniacs who donated all that money only for 0 out of 12 primary wins! They must really wanna SCREAM! HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE!!! Get it!? Scream!? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! (Not that I think that that whole thing was treated even remotely fairly by the media... in fact, Howard Dean's stock went up in my mind afterwards.) No, but really, I'm just gidd. Giddy giddy giddy. As always, I was right. Now EVERYONE is hoppin' on the Kerry bandwagon - but I was there FIRST! And no one can deny it! Just like how I was a New England Patriots fan from the start (remember two years ago, Andy? Remember how everyone told me "Forrest, you do realize they're going to lose, don't you?" Bad officialing, my foot... Vinatieri ALL THE WAY!) And now EVERYONE is a Patriots fan! You know what? I'm a bloody trendsetter! Forget all that polling bulldink, Gallup should just find out what I think.
