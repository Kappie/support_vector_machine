(hi maggie). too bad she's heading home for the summer.  spiritually, i'm actually really trying to read the book of mormon everynight (i've gone three nights in a row) and am planning to go to the temple sometime this week with tory. my testimony has grown a lot lately. when i pray now, i feel like i'm really having a conversation with god. some maay think this blasphemous, but i pray now as if god were sitting next to me and was my buddy. i don't use all the 'thees' and 'thous'. i just talk normal. it's cool. i really feel like i'm having a two-way conversation with him. it gives me hope. i don't always believe the same as others, but there is something inside that let's me know what is important to know.  i really need to go get myself a job right now. i've been slacking lately and that's not good. i just hate looking for work, maybe it's the inner shyness in me or maybe it's the fear of having a job i don't really enjoy. i really feel like a lazy slacker though. i get bored a lot now and start to bug others to break the boredom. enough talking about it though, time for more doing.
