It's recently occured to me how good they are. They're all jolly good, in fact. Better than a great many Blogs out there. I recommend them. Read them. On a different note, I've been thinking about music a lot recently. I hate most modern music. Loathe it. But through the constant exposure to it that a modern, non-hermatic life entails, it's suprising how many good modern songs there are out there. Most artists (or their writers) produce something that makes me long for the the sound of a bag of cats being smashed repeatedly into a wall, or the same song in barely disguised lyrics, such as Busted. However, several songs that I have really liked have come from 'artists' that are otherwise totally crap. I really like . urlLink 'Unemployed Boyfriend'  by  urlLink Everclear  (Ugly bunch, aren't they?) and also  urlLink Connection  by  urlLink Elastica , better known as the Trigger Happy TV theme music. It's better after the opening riff, though. Otherwise, the songs on the same albums are the tuneless dirges I have come to expect from modern bands. So how could they write such good songs? This may be due to the 'thousand monkeys at a thousand typewriters effect', who as everyone knows will eventually produce the greatest novel known to man, through random chance. Or maybe (a shocking thought to be sure) they actually have some talent? But in that case, why produce the dirges? It looks like it's the monkeys, I'm afraid. P.s. I don't like modern music. A sample from my collection:  Jimmy Shand Lemon Jelly - Nice Weather For Ducks Jung-Hwa Ban Jum Marvin - Reasons to be Miserable Abbot and Costello - Who's On First Lynrd Skyrd - Sweet Home Alabama Jurassic Park Theme - Techno Remix. Case closed. (Not a song).
