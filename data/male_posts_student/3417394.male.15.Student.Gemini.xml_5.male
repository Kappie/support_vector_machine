This girl who I talk to a lot (Lacie) is convinced that my b-day on the 26th when in fact it is the 28th. Oh well. I expect presents from all! What sucks more than finals? Nothing. I should probably study. I can't wait  for my  urlLink order  to come in! Who cares? I do now i can use my camera for webcaming without draining the battery in 30 seconds!!! Anyway the party mess is cleaned up and one psycho neighbor sent me home with a bag of trash that got in his yard. I should of told him to go to hell! Oh and if anyone knows why people are moody (and dramatic) lately please comment!!
