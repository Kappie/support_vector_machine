As Big Brother 4 viewers are well aware, the 23-year-old Alison managed to cheat, lie, flirt, and backstab her way to Big Brother 4's final two, where shewas trounced by the equally deviled Jun Song in the program's final houseguest voting. Throughout the show viewers endured Alison's incessant whining regarding whether her relationship with 21-year-old boyfriend Donny would still be intact after he'd seen her Big Brother behavior. Obviously the answer was yes.  Now we have to bear through another season watching Alison cheat, lie, flirt, and backstab -- only this time while she travels (at least partway) around the world. Thanks CBS.
