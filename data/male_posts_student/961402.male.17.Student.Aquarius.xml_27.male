Apparently his mom went to high school with Dukakis. I wonder if he was a hall moniter, and if so did he let bullies out between periods to beat up and steal lunch money?  *kicks self for rim-shot political joke*  Then I went to Madame Johnson about my self-evaluation, but didn't have the proper form type dealy, so I had to go into the IB office. Then I left the IB office with the wrong form and did't want to go back in. Then I went in and discovered that the form was in a room that shouldn't have been gone into at that particular moment. Then I left the room and resolved to avoid it for the next several months.  Now I just wasted ten minutes trying to get rid of Josh, who is an asshole. He slept to friggin' 2'o'clock today, hence my carrying in the disgustingly heavy things my mom got home, for thirty minutes, by myself. Now he tries to wrest (yeah, I said 'wrest'!) the computer from me so he can misspell words to his friends. Grrrr. It'd be a shame if some of his files went missing...Anyway, my mom says I get to keep it for another hour.  So, back to my day...oh, right, being at school for an hour. Eventually I got back to Madame Johnson and she gave me the requisite forms, and hopefully she won't flunk me for forgetting to turn this in two days ago.  My mom picked me up and set forth to Wallmart, or possibly Kmart, or Targetmart, or some giant box filled with cheap merchandise. Tess and me played catch with a giant bouncy ball in the luggage isle while my mom got various stuff for the imminent Costa Rica trip.  Then I went home and did nothing for several hours, and by nothing I mean play sim games from the mid-90's. \/\/00+. At some points my mom brought home the aforementioned obscenely hevy rugs and I failed to wake up Josh despite my best efforts. Then I remembered the colassal mass of papers scattered about the attic and tried to tame some of the more highly evolved stacks, but eventually gave up. Then I came back to the computer and wrote this. Fascinating stuff.  I gotta get started on that Long Fuse... *your mom has a  short  fuse! Oooooooo...* Yeah, I deserve that mental bitchslap.
