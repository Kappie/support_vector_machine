Anyway, I have lost interest in making a site (all honesty) and I have a crude, quaint, but relatively healthier substitute.  I write newsletters.  It started as a project in school, but then I am advancing it for real.  You may receive the November copy soon.  Gimme your address.  If you already have given me your address in full and without acronym, ignore this message.    I hope when you receive the newsletter type anthology, youll be delighted to write for it.  It is just so bootleg and rogue that writing a newsletter reminds me of La Solidaridad.  I wish to be a young, modern propagandist.  But, unlike  welgistas  who just rant without intelligence and are usually driven by mob crowding, I am probably going to be a lone revolutionary for things people don't really care about.
