Regardless, these views continue to affect other people in their daily lives.  One interestnig viewpoint I got from my housemate(I stay at a hostel) is that in the end, humans are only God's slaves. Don't get all angry first, hear him out. When humans are born, they play for a few years, then study hard, work hard, earn money then die. So what's the actual point of living? Just to serve God??  My stand would be somewhat in between that. My aim in life is not only to score high, but also to help people. I view myyself as a sort of stepping stone for other people to become greater, hence the phoenix concept and sacrificial. If I think something is worthwhile, I will stop at no costs to complete it. If a promise comes out of my mouth, I will pull out all stops to fulfil it. yes, even stupid promises I made, which is partly why i am training to think before I speak. I made some pretty stupid promises but I'll still try to fulfil them. If anyone has any problems, I will always try to be there. Luckily no one seems to need me much, haha...
