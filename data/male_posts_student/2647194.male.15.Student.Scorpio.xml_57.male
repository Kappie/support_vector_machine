Anyway...here's today:  Math: I worked ahead last week, yet I still have a bit of homework tonight. How the f@#% did that happen?  Science: Great...another lab. And we still have a lab report to do. On another note, I somehow got into a conversation with Kacy, Will, Michelle, Kevin, and Kevin about sex and masturbation. Uh....yeah weird. It was kinda funny though, I admit.  Band: prepared for concert, need I say more?  Spanish: did a few quizzes in preparation for Thursday's test  English: Got to skip it because of band. Isn't music grand?  Social: see above  After school: took the bus home, ran an errand. To *drum roll* Cottage Grove Florist. I got a white rose boutonerre for the concert, and some other things...  The concert went pretty smoothly, except for the start. I was to open the concert with the second movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, but it was not to be without any technical difficulties. Firstly, I started playing. The damned power strip that supplied electicity to the percussion section was stuck under the pedals, so they couldn't be pressed. I stopped, and fixed the problem by kicking it out of the way. During this, the piano power plug-1 of 5, I might add-came out. Again, I had to fix the problem. What a joy...  Our last piece kicked major a$$. Berceuse and Finale was pretty dang good, considering I had never played quite that loud during the rehearsal, so I made a ton of people jump. But hey-if you're a percussionist playing loud rolls through that whole thing, and you're wearing a tux, you're going to get pretty hot.  After the concert was pretty fun too...except for the part when I had to load up the drum set for tommorow's concert (yes, there's another) in my station wagon out in the rain. Wasn't something to get jollies out of. I honestly did not know that Adam attempted suicide before, so thats one thing I learned. It also explained why he was out of school for 1.5 months.  I tried putting ice on my lips before (kissing ice...lol), but it didn't do a whole lot. I hate braces with a passion almost equal to my hatred of SUVs, but not quite. Braces suck!  Oh, and I did slip and fall today thanks to this damn rain, and I didn't get hurt at all, so here's some lyrics:  "Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came to my rescue Heaven must be watchin' over me  When the shadows fallin' and the day turns into night I hear my angel callin' and I can't wait to see the light Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came down to my rescue Heaven must be watchin' over me  Sometimes I get a feelin' like a fever comin' over me Just a touch of my angels hand and I'm right back on my feet  Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came down to my rescue Heaven must be watchin' over me  Stay with me baby. Come down from the sky Just like an angel. Take me to paradise  Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came down to my rescue Heaven must be watchin' over me"  -"Angel of Mercy", Johnny Lang
