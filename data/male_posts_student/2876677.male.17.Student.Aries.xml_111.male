Seeing as I cannot use AIM, and it is indeed raining, I have very little to do. Well actually I could read or something, but let's be serious. I really want to go play in the rain. No one likes to though. I have no one to go jump in puddles with me. I remember when I was little, I dragged my brother and sister out in the rain with me and we jumped in puddles and got totally soaked. Apparently my mum didn't appreciate that much, because when we got inside I got a spankin'. Other then the pain at the very end it was a good time. I would do it again. It's no fun alone though. A few weeks back I went for a nice 3 mile run in the pouring rain. Best run of my life. I love the rain. What can I say? I like being crazy and stupid and fun sometimes; just let it go, run in the rain, forget everything. Someday I'll teach someone to smell the rain, to smell the seasons. Have you ever smelt the rain? You haven't live till you have. Someday that someone will remind me to slow down and remember to smell the seasons or stand in the rain for a moment, stopping time. Someday. Until then, I am sitting here writing because people seem to enjoy the idiot box so much it renders them useless.   The best things in life are free. It's the simple things people miss everyday that make me happy.
