I don't know how this works, but this year spring break spelled b-o-r-i-n-g. literally. It's the beginning of school again, and other than English, I honestly don't mind it. Jazz band's fun. My english essay has a beginning, middle, and end that are non-existent as of right now. The outline is done, and I don't want to do any more work on that stupid thing. It's also the middle of the day-4:00, and boring as hell.  Here's how my day went: Rose at 7:30, after 7 and a half hours of sleep. Didn't feel that good after coming off of 10 hours the previous night. I left for church at 8:50, arrived at 9:20. Waited around for family mass to start. Half-way through, the suit-sporting me (lol) played a short, 2 minute piano piece, Reflection, by George Winston. I never would have thought of this happening in Church, but there was enough applause for me to fit in about 3-4 bows. No lie. And the family mass isn't that big of an audience compared to the main mass.  May 23rd: I get the honor of playing a 3 minute piece, most likely Joy by George Winston, at both main masses. Whoohoo-I get to wear a suit again. It also happens to be the day of the WYO's Pops and Popcorn concert at Central Park, Woodbury. I wonder how many bows I'll be taking that day...  Other than the mentionings and praise at Church, today has been downright dreary. I finished my English outline, used up my time online already, and the weather absolutely sucks. Hopefully the latter part of this week will be as good as they say it will...
