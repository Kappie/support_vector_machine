When I come to terms with this, things will start to clear.  I still have not made it to the gym. My lazy bones have been collecting dust in the bed or infront of the television. Cry me a river, so I can float away. Work is still something I dread. I don't want to help anyone, I hate jewelry and I am doing all I can to find a way out.  I don't mind my coworkers as much anymore. I yelled my fucking mouth off at Matt last night becuase of the way he handled a customer. FUCK! I just realized that I don't care about the customer. Buy or get out, see if I fucking care. This experiment is going all wrong.  Tonight we are having an unofficial zales christmas party. It's unofficial so we don't have to invite sherry, amanda, and atty. Supposly no one likes them much. Sherry and Atty are both over 40, Sherry being around 60 and Amanda is on the brain dead side of humanity. So I guess it will be all the young, hip people. I am part of the cool crowd. Fucking kill me now. I guess I am just too much fun to miss out on. So anyways, mimi and I are going over to Heathers house to play scatagories and drink some booze. Should be fun. This new girl, shelby, is bringing her boyfriend Jason. I met Jason about two days ago and the guy is fucking rad. We talked awhile and he runs a tattoo shop in Petaluma, plays bass, guitar, and some recording, surfs/snowboards/skate, vegetarian, and listens to \m/SLAYER\m/ and other such great metal and hardcore like reversal of man, orchid, and DEP. He also is going to hook me up with a red atom on my left arm and touch up my shitty blue atom on my right arm all for 100 bucks. I am stoked. So hopefully we can talk some more tonight and maybe he will teach me how to surf and I can be all: DUDE! like I totally road this wave to the sky! DUDE! WOAH! RAD!  Eitherway, I am getting smashed. I hope I don't spill anything.   current mood: stoked current music: Sunny Day Real Estate - LP2 - 07 - Iscarabaid
