Was quite easy, one straight direct bus and we reached there. We happily checked in and we played cheat, checking in early. Well b4 our supposed check in time, we had our bath n "fun" n were ready to go out. Hurray!   Well it was a pretty let down when we discovered we couldnt enter the jackpot because we werent members. Saddening. But well, we found the arcade n although we eventually spent alot of money, we were happy to be able to play alot of things we enjoy. After a while we were exhausted n we went to have an uneventful lunch n back to the room.  Hehehehe back to somemore fun but den tis time my darlyng drank a mini bottle of wine....ooooo she turned so wild n sexy....oooooooo such nice........  n den I was exhausted and wanted to sleep but my darlyng wasnt satisfied n wanted more!!! DEVIL!!!!!!  Splish splish splash splash.....we awoke to heavy thunderstorm outside....it has been raining so frequently everyday......   Argh.....drenched ....my slippers feel so slimy n wet....ar! My darling managed to cheer herself up with a nice waffle...she ar.....always refer waffles to pancakes. . . . Pool!!! . . . My darlyng has learnt relatively well how to play pool!!! Hurray!!!
