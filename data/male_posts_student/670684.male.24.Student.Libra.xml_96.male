I knew the sound would be tough, but we can sync sound with image, so no one knows the difference much of the time.  The problem is, you need footage to sync sound with...an image of Dan Wearsch contemplating a move works well with the voices of JW and Philbrook.  Unfortunately, we have very little stock footage of player close-ups...it's mostly mid-range stuff, which includes too many people milling about, so you have Rachel Day in the background for one picture, and then you cut to something else, and you come back and Rachel is gone.  It doesn't sync well.  So we're going to have to take what we have and turn it into something.  Brian Thomas and I will work on this with our free time over the next few months.  Everyone is welcome to come to Austin, view a bit of footage, and tell us what we should focus on when making this film.  We hope to be done by the end of April!  Nailed the job interview.
