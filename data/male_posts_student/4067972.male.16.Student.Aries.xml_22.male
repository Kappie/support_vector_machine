Great movie, though at times, i was distracted by certain people ( you know who you are).  It was...well.. i don't remember if it's better than the first or not...it's been a while.  I think it was better, but not worse...maybe the same-- i don't remember. Anyway, great movie.  I wanna go see The Village and The Manchurian Candidate too.  They look good anyway.  Laura suggested Napoleon Dynamite, but i dunno. It looks funny, but i haven't had good luck with funny movies lately...Oh, and before the movie my aunt took me and my brother to buy shoes...and i thought about cleaning my room(just thought you'd like to know.) Whelp, got to go sleep now.  I have to get up at 7:30am so i can stain my gramma's deck (bleh).
