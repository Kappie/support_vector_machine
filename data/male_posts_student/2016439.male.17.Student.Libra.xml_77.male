Because I'm an only child (most of the time, but my lil' bro could be coming down for a bit this summer), I don't have anyone whom I can talk to/make fun of every day ;-)  Anyways, as we were sitting over some delicious Fazoli's breadsticks (I no longer hate Fazoli's; in fact, we're now having a love affair), my friend Jenny and I started talking about college while everyone else was getting their food.  It's so cool, because she and I are the only ones (although another newbie to the group Cacen is turning out to be as well) who are planning on going to school out of state.  Basically, that means that the end of March/beginning of April is going to be Hellfest 2005 for us because it's basically feeling like a sitting duck waiting to be lucky enough to be shot in the neck by a crapshoot college.  Meanwhile back at the ranch, we came to the startling conclusion that as it stands, if a woman gets pregnant TO-day, her child and our college admissions decisions should come in right at about the same time.  Cool, eh?  So, I'm going to one of those pregnancy tracker sites, randomly pick a pregnancy to track, and follow it.  Why?  Because I'm insane, but you already know that.  I think she and I just really psyched ourselves out about college.  Turns out Jenny's going to NYC at the beginning of August to check out NYU and have her interview with  urlLink Yale .  Mine's not until the beginning of next year, so I'll probably drill her about it so I can be fully prepared.  As I've been finishing up my essays for a couple of the colleges I'm applying to, I've been visiting a couple of sites for writing and interview tips, and I came across  urlLink one  that had a section on some rather "interesting" things found in some admissions essays.  Here are my favorites:  · If Homer’s primary view of mortal life could be expressed in a word it would be this: life is fleeting. · Such things as divorces, separations, and annulments greatly reduce the need for adultery to be committed. · Playing the saxophone lets me develop technique and skill which will help me in the future, since I would like to become a doctor. · There was one man in particular who caught my attention. He was a tiny man with ridiculously features all of which, with the exception of his nose, seemed to drown in the mass of the delicate transparent pinkish flesh that cascaded from his forehead and flowed over the collar of his tuxedo and the edge of his bow tie. · Filled with Victorian furniture and beautiful antique fixtures, even at that age I was amazed.  · As an extra, we even saw Elizabeth Taylor’s home, which had a bridge attaching it to the hoe across the street. · I would love to attend a college where the foundation was built upon women. · I enjoyed my bondage with the family and especially with their mule, Jake.  Haha, yeah.  Suffice it to say, that made me feel much more confident about my essays :-).  But alas, that confidence will not last long, for AP scores are now available over the phone.  I'm not going to pay $8 to get them, but just knowing that they're in stone and that I shall soon have them mailed to me...*shudders*  Life can be so cruel.
