[commercial break]  "Yes, one of you has made it to the top... three.  That's right, three.  We'll find out who when we come back."  [commercial break]  "Hadas, Kim, one of you has made it to the top three.  And America has voted, and they have chosen... to tell you right after this break."  [commercial break]  "Hadas, I'm sorry, but the American people have... done something that we'll find out after this commercial."  [commercial break]  "Hadas, you're not in the top three.  But that means... we need to go to break."  [commercial break]  "Kim, you're in the top... how many?  Stay tuned to find out."  [commercial break]  etc...
