These things are EVERYWHERE and in massive numbers.  Best quote I saw on these buggers was: "Periodical cicadas don't bother to escape when confronted, and the reason is they don't have to -- since they emerge in HUGE numbers,"  These things are so numerous, it is unreal.  It seems like the streets are littered with dead bodies of these things yet they keep coming.  So basically these things are kinda loud too, they make this eerie sound that vaguely resembles the sound of a cricket but nothing like it.  To add to the intrigue, these things appear every 17 years for 2 months only and then die off until the next cycle.  I found all of this quite interesting, I provided a link above for all those non-affected parties who mike be curios about the cicadas.  Have a nice weekend people.
