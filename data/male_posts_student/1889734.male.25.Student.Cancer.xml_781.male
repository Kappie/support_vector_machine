I've decided not to spend too much time trying to catch up on the news of the past week, other than a few items I want to comment on later.  If all goes well this evening, I'll have quite a few posts.   And welcome to Terry Winters, who posted a few comments - notably a nice tip on a cheap hard drive for Steve.  Good deal there!  Anyway, none of you know Terry.  He is a coworker here at Pfizer who shares the next cubicle.  We had an interesting conversation on Iraq on my last day here prior to vacation, and I gave him the Blog URL.  He should bring a good perspective to our ramblings.   More later....
