But then i realized that i should do some research on fairies and find out why they are so gay. Here is what i found out: I found out that fairies are actually gay people from new york that formed a clan and dressed up in princess suits and shrunk themself with jetpacks! how gay is that. The craziest part about fairies is that they are everywere, there are even soup fairies that hide in your soup and bagels. Next time you tase something soupy in your bagel just know that it is a soup fairy that is lost in the space of time. Anyway there is no cure for fairyness and if you know a fairy tou should call me so i can pee on them and go home happy.
