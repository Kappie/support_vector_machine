One doubt i have though , when i was entering engineering, i had the sale impression about engineering college as well, but it turend out to be 4 years of holidays :) Lets see how this one turns out. Waise one resolution i have taken, i will work hard this time around, and i will try my level best to keep up my grades unlike my life in engg. So lets see how this resolution turns out to be.
