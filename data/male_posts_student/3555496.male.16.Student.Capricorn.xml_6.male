"i wonder what she is doing today?" so i thought i would give her a call, but soon i just relized that she left for las vegas. well i go to the kitchen to check whats there to eat. there wasn't anything. we hadn't been to the grocery store like in 2 weeks. i'm so hungry. if anyone can read this message send me food or offer me to betaken out to lunch or dinner. or donate to the feed razo fund.
