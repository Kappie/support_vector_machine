Comic Editing  Takkun (the web ninja!) has sent me a template that I  think  I can work with and so we're looking into mass producing the templates and I'll start re-drawing the comics.   New comics  Coming slowly but surely.  I think I might all out stop making new ones at some point in time because a) I run out of ideas quickly and b) editing is going to be a bitch.   The History of Project: Oddville  In the works.  It won't be huge, but it'll explain a few things.   Cast feature  Takkun has asked me to draw up the cast pictures and those will be done soon.   Other notes  I'm starting to work now (real life sucks) and so does Takkun.  So if things seem slow around here, we're doing our best.  Mad props to Takkun and FillerKori.
