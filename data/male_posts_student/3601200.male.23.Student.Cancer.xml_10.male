I'm sure that any fan can remember squirming in anticipation when, in Predator 2, they say the Alien skull on the trophy wall of the Predator's ship.  But no, we'd have to wait for ten years before this idea came to fruition.  And now it has.  So what do you do when a movie comes out that is the ideological child of two of the greatest action/horror franchises of all time?  An idea so strong that it has spawned web sites, comic books, video games, and a whole slew of nerds?  What you do is go see the movie.  There are wo distinct possibilities here.  Possibility one (1) is that the movie rocks.  Unequivicable awesomeness just seeps from its every moment, and this movie is responsible for the nerd population of the world dropping by three-quarters due to so many fanboys dropping like flies from pleasure-induced anuerisms.  Possibility two (2) is that the movie sucks.  And sucks bad.  So insanely bad that it makes God cry.  There is no middleground here where this movie could just be average due to the hype behind it, at least among the fans.  Most normal people probably don't know about it as it hasn't been too terribly advertised, to its credit.  Personally, I hope that it's good, although I expect it to be bad.  First off, I'm not a big action/horror buff, so action movies have to be pretty damn good to impress me.  Second, with the slew of crappy movies which have been coming out lately, ANY good movie is in short supply.  Third, I'm an AVP fan.  I know all the backstory and whatnot behind both the Aliens and Predator franchises.  Here's to hoping.  I'll post my review tomorrow night.
