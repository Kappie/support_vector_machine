I went to tim's house and got there at around 10:20.  We didn't actually leave until around 11:00.  ...only becase JASON didn't get his co2 before he came. ;-) We drove back down to the woods we were going to play at, then unloaded our stuff, suited up completly, and walked, guns in hand, in search of the other guys we were playing with that had already gone out there. We reached a small clearing where we saw one of the guys motion to us and tell us that they were in the middle of hunting a small child.  YES he was playing too. He was just hiding, and he did have a paintball gun with him to defend himself.  Real short kid. We couldn't find him, so he gave up. Kind of backwards. Then i was going to test fire my gun because i hadn't shot it today. But no, of course, it didn't work. Safety off, co2 full, paint in the hopper, no fire.  So now i'm serioulsy peeved and annoyed. Peeved because it won't work, and annoyed because i don't know what's wrong with it and i don't know how long or how much it will take to fix it. Now it is getting towards noon and it is very warm and verry humid. So we decide to take to the woods. We find a nice spot that's shaded, and has a small stream running through one part of it.  And a swing was in the middle of a clearing there. A nice place for paintball. It wasn't really fair, because I now had to use a winchester paintball gun, that wasn't excellent, and one of my partners had the same kind of gun. My other teamate had a tippmann 98 with a lapco bigshot, and a stock. It was very nice. I also let him use my electronic hopper which allowed him to shoot really fast. The first game i was shot in the elbow while crawling\kneeling over the top of a hill. They got the flag that time. The second time we started on the other side, and i shot more. Still, no range. So i try to get closer. I crawl up towards this tree, and i'm in the underbrush so no one can see me. I'm also flat on the ground so it's kind of hard to crawl with a paintball gun. I get to my tree, and it just so happened, that if i lean any space at all to my left, I'm in the line of fire of an enemy.  Same story for my right. I eventually got shot in the knee by the little kid. He had a pretty good gun though. My other teamate, tim, was trying to flank, but he got shot right between the eyes on his mask from a Tippmann A-5. With a very accurate barrel.  But it was cool crawling because i was getting shot at. The paint splat on my friend's mask was awesome. He took a picture of it. Then accidentally erased it. So we shot his mask again. Then we did some defending stuff. Me, the little guy, and Jason with the tippmann 98, went over the stream and on to the other side. The enemy's job was to eliminate or cross the river.  I was the first to go. Naturally.  I was moving up to take down this guy right across the stream, but NO RANGE!! I accidentally shot tim. Hehe, he was reffing and taking pictures. Thus my profile picture. So then, the A-5 guy shot me with his amazingly accurate gun.  So i was out and had nothing else to do, so i swang on the swing. (oh yes, i swang) and supplied paint to people that were running out.  Then we walked back through a very hot path. (i didn't even wear my camo jacket. it was to hot. So i just went with my white under shirt.) back to a very hot car and drove home to a nice cup of cold water. So there is the epic of my paint ball experience in the woods. (hopefully not the last one)
