Now more then ever, the public needs a leading man who, despite flinging off specs and having hair tousled by cinematic winds, still looks, at best, only pleasant. It worked!  There was this irrelevant scene- the hunched ostrich daughter of Peter Parker's landlord timidly enters his dingy room, asking him if he wants a slice of chocolate cake and a glass of milk. You're certain you've seen these two before: in yourself.  Then a close-up. Her perfect teeth, androgynous eyes and anorexic frame suggests that she's probably a model who, after the shoot, will be heading down to a fluffer party with Tobey Maguire.   The things we still want to believe.
