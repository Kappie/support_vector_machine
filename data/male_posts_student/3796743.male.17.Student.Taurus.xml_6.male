I met Alex and Emmy and we went downtown to Ramblin' Jacks and we were having a great time. Emmy and Alex decided to go visit their techie friends at another table, and never came back. I felt dumb, or I don't know a good word. ...so I drank a liter of Diet Pepsi from the carafe at the booth by myself for like 25 minutes. After that, I decided they had enough time to come back and talk to me if they actually wanted to, and they didn't. So I left.  I figured I could make better use of my time. Lately I've probably been over analyzing way too many things, and this is one of em. But it kinda like was the last little thing that finally pushed me over. After I left, I drove. I drove for about an hour. With my windows rolled down and my music loud. I drove everywhere. I drove by a lot of peoples houses, I don't know why...I just drove. Then I came home and layed on my floor staring at the ceiling for several minutes. That was just the end of my day. I haven't had a bad day in a long time, and usually a little thing like that doesn't ruin a day for me, but I dunno.  I'm tired. I'm really tired. Of being so nice to people, when they're not nice to me. I'm sick of being John the rich boy who I'd rather not care about..., I'd rather be John the nice boy, or something good like that. I loan people money and don't ask for it back. I give people rides whenever they need it. I wake up early just to go hang out with someone. I don't know what else to do...I'm thinking that I need to just take some time off. Just not try to be social for an entire week. I don't think I can do that. I think I blew this way out of proportion, but I'm depressed, and thats how life goes when you're depressed.  Perhaps I should explain something to everybody, something that most people probably don't see when they meet me or talk to me. I'm actually nice, and I'm actually a human. No matter how much you people like to stereotype me or hate me. I'm a nice guy. I'm not rich, no matter how much you insist I am, I'm not. And just because we have different views on many things doesn't matter, I love you just the same. People around here see me as someone who doesn't care about people. They think I'm some rich Republican a-hole who could care less about everybody else. And while I am a middle-class Californian with some right wing views doesn't mean that I don't respect you for who you are. I'm sick of this crap. I've never shown weakness. I don't like to. That's probably why I get treated differently. I'm not that happy every day of my life. My life is not as easy as I may make it look sometimes. Thats just the way you see it. I don't like you to see it when its bad or unhappy. So I just wont say anything or talk as much. I guess what I'm asking for here today, is for people to understand that I have feelings too. That's all. And like I said...I'm tired. This summer is going to give me a chance to rest and take a break, that's what I'm doing. And in September and I'll be awake, and ready for another year. So I'll update this later, like tomorrow. Good night everybody!
