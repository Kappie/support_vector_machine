We’ve survived some of our hardships, and this time our bleedings can’t be mended I used to be the cure you’d use, but now I am your tool to abuse And say you’re not alone, but I am alone (on my own) I get lost in your eyes, they capture me with their trances, a trend you intended to follow Hope you are happy, I am hollow and falling away  Another night wasted And I am wasting away, blowing in the wind like a futile flag I am just a one-time memento, a souvenir And it’s tearing my seams, and all seems black   I just need to be rolled up and put away until you need me again It’s cold out here, in this place, and I can’t survive this season It used to be the time of romance, yeah, our time to spread or buds and grow But we seem to be rotting to the core, trampled on and buried deep in the snow I received your letter, it was delivered on time this time It was only three words, not the three that I used to love to say “I Hate You.” written on the paper, should’ve been written in stone And now it’s you’re fault you’re alone, but I still am alone (on my own) I get lost in your eyes, they capture me with their trances, a trend you intended to follow Hope you are happy, I am hollow and falling away  Another night wasted And I am wasting away, blowing in the wind like a futile flag I am just a one-time memento, a souvenir And it’s tearing my seams, and all seems black  Another night wasted And I am wasting away, blowing in the wind like a futile flag I am just a one-time memento, a souvenir And it’s tearing my seams, and all seems black   I know that we just had our secret rendezvous, but it’s a killer when you must leave These feelings that I’ve been back are needing to be released, suppressed without much ease And if I say them it seems like another déjà vu,  It must be because there was another “It’s me, not you.”
