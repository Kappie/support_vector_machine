Thank God i dont get to take the test home so my parents can see that. i got an 88 on the history multiple choice test i took yesterday.  my dad got very pissed at me in car today. because of my final scores. ugh. finals are harder to do well on than other things; he should bitch at me as much for them. so technically im gorunded; well, i can go out, but no TV and computer til end of year during week. ill still do it tho, as long as mom doesnt know about the thing...ie in like 2 or 3 weeks.   What i know of scores:  History:81 on final, 88 on 75 pt multiple choice test, 85 semestre grade. Math: 91 on final(only A), 92 or 3 on quarter, b or b+ por semestre English: 85 on final... 92 por semestre Biology: 80 on final(76 w/o curb); 82 on quarter, 80 por semestre..i think..i dont remember fully... Spanish: 88 on final...94 or 5 por semestre, since that class is simple. see the main two things we're gonna do this year are the habia tense(could be span 4) and the future tense(next chapter). i know both already. so ill try to get out of this, tho maybe next week when my finals arent fresh on my parents minds. sofia taught me too much. for a span 2 final, she taught me the futurue tense, just in case. oi  fuck, mrs klemmer just walked behind me. we talked about her at lunch like 2 weeks ago..very unpleasant. ie, who would have sex with her?????? and can u picture this gentle lady moaning er that crap? khoda, it was frightful.  yes, thats my new thing. khoda. it means God in farsi, so why not.  i forgot to mention. a persian tutor came on sunday. she was surprised i could read and write farsi. which was absolutely no help from my dad, thank you very much. even all of my grammar was my own doing. i taught myself his language. i dont get why hes against it or whatever. just out of spite, im gonna go to the university of tijuana and make a business in iran. lol...he wants me to go to ivy league.  fuck the ivy league.  i have 15 mins...but ill probably play a game..or..better yet..print something and waste this schools resources, without my parents knowledge. yay!!!!!  see you later..  much love  peace  ~alex.    oh yeah, im going to argentina in the summer(probably), dont remember if i said so
