So I gues I have to write this because I was harping on the Canadians in one of my former blogs. BUt still its only one medal and Canada should still have more. We have mor money better facilities better well.... everything. It is still an imbarassment for Canadian athletes to lose so badly in the Oylmpics.  Oh yeah and on anothern note the olympics should be for amateur athletes under 25. I mean really Canada sent a woman for the shooting competion that was 53 years old. Come on (Come on what..... hehe sorry back to typing) no wonder we suck we are sending old bags to the olympics. The Canadians must be a laughing stock at the Olympics.  lates,  Smog
