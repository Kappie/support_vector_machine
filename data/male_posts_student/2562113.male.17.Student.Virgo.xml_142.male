(in response to nick carrying 4? sixpacks all on top of each other)) so the night before that was amandas and i was driving which wasnt that bad, but for some reason i was in a very irratible mood. Everyone was coming up to me trying to make conversation but i guess i wasnt in the mood, and as a result i was extremely nsaty to just about every person, and this attitude seemingly carried out through the week... ive done many apologies to those i feel i hurt or pissed off but if i forgot to apologies im sorry. Hopefully ill stop PMS'ing soon. last night made the vacation for me, thanks for driving john. ill talk to all soon  PS. for some reason i have started playing basketball. If any smuts or others wish to play just shout me a holla and ill go (unless there are extenuating circumstances of course). later darin
