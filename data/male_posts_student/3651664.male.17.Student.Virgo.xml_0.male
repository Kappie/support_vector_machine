Quick, go get some Socialism in a Can! We have to fix this horrible atrocity!  Oh wait, this is a good thing.  The top 5% of taxpayers in this country  urlLink pay more than half  (53%) of all income taxes. The top 1% pay 30% of income taxes. How can this be fair? These are the people who pump money back into the economy and create new jobs. These are the people to have worked the hardest to succeed, and the government is punishing them.  So while the top 5% of taxpayers are paying the most taxes, the bottom 35% of income earners  urlLink pay ZERO income taxes . That's right. Zero. And yet, they collect tax returns on taxes they don't pay.  So why is it unfair that the 95% of people who PAY taxes have the largest tax burden?  You're right. It's not.
