"There was also a charming young man talking to his girlfriend on the phone next to us: 'Hon, we should go out dancing or something tonight, it’ll be nice. And then afterwards we can come back to my place and have some awesome sex. Yeah babe, it’ll be sweet.' One tends to worry about the gene pool."  I thought it was quite humourous. Hopefully, the feeling is mutual.
