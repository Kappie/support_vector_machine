Crystal gave me a bottle of Cherry Whiskey. MMMmmmMMM. Yesterday, went to Calgary, bought some sweet shoes. I'll put a picture of them up here later. Got stranded in the snow, Crystal missed work today. Now I'm waiting for her call. No comments on this one. If you have something to say, comment on the last post.
