Whilst playing grabass at Barnes  Noble a few days ago, I happened across his latest testament,  urlLink The Spirit of Terrorism .  Baudrillard is a cultural theorist who is lumped into postmodern, poststructural, and nihilist camps, but his ideas are similar and different to all three.  He believes reality ceased to exist long ago, and was replaced by virtual reality, or hyperreality.  His opus,  urlLink Simulacra and Simulation , outlines the loss of symbolic interchange, and rising global tendencies.    In college, I was introduced to Baudrillard on a whim, and fell more in love with his theories than any other camp of thought or person of note ever.  This brought about a  urlLink poor photo essay  based on my wrong interpretation of his ideas, and later an emulation of Baudrillard's thoughts and style in  urlLink a paper about MTV's The Real World .  His writing is sparse and fragmented, coming across as off-the-cuff ramblings of a savant, musings so eloquant you hate his ability to provide them so effortlessly.  It took me over a dozen readings of  urlLink Introducing Baudrillard  to finally understand his most basic points, and to be honest, the entire book still doesn't make sense.  I first felt comfortable with Baudrillard when I read  urlLink the gulf war did not take place , three essays describing the hyperreality of Bush Sr.'s initiative in Iraq and its lack of honest consequences...honest in real, not in moral.   I hated myself for thinking this, but I know I'm not the only person who wasn't immediately horrified, so I'll say it:  as soon as I heard about the terrorist attacks in NYC, my first thought was "This means Baudrillard is going to write again."  Granted, I heard on radio first...the images weren't readily avaibale to me until noon, and those changed my outlook, but only to a superfluous extent...I saw horror, but, as mentioned by many pundits that day and many other days, the horror was terrific.  And while terrific is a derivative of terrible, it also holds close meaning to fantastic, or a more positive, awe-inspiring in a good way tonality.    This is what Baudrillard talks about here.  I don't want to explain it, because until I read it five or six more times, I won't have it down.  But he looks at 9/11 from a global perspective, as the start of the war against globalism, and how globalism is the matrix of humanity.    One interesting point...when I saw the Iraq situation this time around, and the call against Weapons of Mass Destruction, I wondered how that would affect Baurdillard's call of the first Gulf War as a non-event (he doesn't say that it didn't happen, but that it wasn't war in the way war is, it was smoke and mirrors for the people by building up a poor opponent, pummeling him, and reveling in the glory of a best man wins when the winner was never in question).  Looking back, his book works just as well, if not better, the second time around.  Who really thinks we were afraid of WMDs?  Or that we wanted to liberate the Iraqi people?  We needed a show of might, and for 12 years, Iraq has been our canvas to show the world our power.
