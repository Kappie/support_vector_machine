i take eng 11 too seriously.  completely wrong thought of the day: "...and whatever i do, on account of all my thoughts turning into reality, i shouldn't think of the ceiling fan turning into a whirling blade device of death that suddenly detaches itself from the ceiling and systematically ricochets and kills everyone in the room other than myself by cracking their skulls in half or by decapitating them or by severing their limbs or by splitting their torsos in half causing their vital organs to spew out of their bodies while, in any case, causing gallons of blood to gush out of the large, gaping wounds leaving crimson stains all over the floor while the dismembered corpses all plop down in big, bloody piles in different sections of the room. whoops! too late!" *well, i have to let my twisted self loose somewhere... oh, c'mon, don't give me that! it's not like you've never been to rotten.com O_o (for the record, i myself have never been there)*
