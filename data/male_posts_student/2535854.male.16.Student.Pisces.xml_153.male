Then made like 3 eggs into scrambbled eggs for breakfast/lunch....and watched the 1st half of the Asia Cup 1st Quarterfinal which featured Bahrain vs Uzbekistan which was a good game...heard it finished 2-2 and Bahrain won on penalties...  Parents not home...so music`s on loud...  And i`m not at CHS attending that 4-way Installation Day...there`s no need for me to be there I feel.  I have homework to catch up. I`ll blog back lay-ta .
