I guess we were quite slow, because I noticed we took a longer time to reach the MRT. Maybe we were travelling behind buses again.   Hmmm. Even ducks enjoyed Orientation today, even though the cats got dirty when crawling on mud. Ergh ergh ergh! Okie. Hmm. The first thing we do is the Telematch. O.O! Hmmmm. The games were quite fun overall, although we ended up dirtier than yesterday. Heh Heh. Hmm. I noticed that Yao Long looks very much like Lionel, with and without specs. A very creepy resemblance, if you ask me. Hmm.  After that, we were given a small break. The girls went off to bath. O.O After the break was the Mass Dance. Ayiah....again. So sian le leh. Hmm. Me and my partner dance quite wekll, but we always fumble during the Tango  Cha-Cha. Heh Heh. OH my goodness! WQ is totally funny! He was dancing with Hidayah (or Yu...dunnoe which twin came into PJ). Oh my god! he so sitff! He only moved here and there, without even clapping hands (when we are supposed to). His movement is very woody and stiffy....I really wanted to laugh out loud (okay, I did when I was recounting what I saw to the other cats at the choir audition). HAHAHAHA!  Hmmm. We went for lunch. O.O I ate the rice with many many dishes. Ayierr. I ate fried food! I am not supposed to do that. I chatted with the guys and Joy on my table lor. HaHa. Yao Long joked that we four are the 'gay clan'. Heh. We chatted lor. Woah! That Joy (our OGL, if you cats remember) very de suspicious leh. We just moved her plate (while she was away) to make room for Auntie to clean. She came back and ket insisting we did something to her plate. "Five guys all telling me the same thing and my plate is moved elsewhere! I am not stupid!" Heh Heh. :P What a suspicious Joy.  After that, the tribes of Olympus gathered together to bond lor. We have to play with other cats from other tribes. Hmmm. It was quite fun. I knew quite a lot of cats now. Heh Heh. After that, we proceeded to LT1 to make our mascots.   Hmm. I didn't contribute to mascot-making. I was mainly chatting with Yong Joo and the Indian girl (I still don't remember her name) who was from choir. Hmmm. Our OG went to take a group pic together. Hmm. At 3, we went to the Hall. At 3, it was time for choir audition. Me, Janet (who was from the same clan) and the Indian Girl went together la.  Hmm. We met Ji and Gloria there. Hmm. The conductor hasn't arrived yet. The TIC is Miss Elieen Toh (right?) and she's an ex-Riverside teacher. O.O Soon, a repeat senior named Astro came to talk to us for awhile. Hmmm.  Soon, the conductor, Mr Francis Liew (right? I think so), came in. O.O He's very motivational. Hmm. He reminds me of Miss Choo, if you ask me. His attitude lor, espeically with the one about competing in SYF, even the principal said there is not a need to ("I want to see how well we do against other colleges and we will work from that standing". That's what Miss Choo said to us last time). Hmm. He went around asking everyone. I was the first to be asked. He recongized Miss Choo, I think. I replied "Of course" to his question of me wanting to be in choir, and he said "Thank You!". I am beginning to like him. After a long motivational speech, he started auditioning. Actually, it wasn't really auditioning. He is just testing our voices and see where he would put us. Hmm. Meanwhile, the four of us were chatting with Miss Eileen. We were among the last to be tested.   Hmmm. He tested CQ first. Hmm. After CQ, it was me. I first informed him that I wasn't exactly pitch-perfect. He said "Okay. Now I know. Thank you!" and hit four low notes. I sang them la. Guess what he said? He said "Who says you sucks at pitching? You pitched perfectly ma! Go bash that person up!" I was like "Really?!!" Oh my god! He just made my day! Nobody told me I pitched perfectly before!! Although I fumbled on the other notes (because I was too happy and excited and kept laughing, my high voice came out). He said me and CQ needs to use our low voices, not our falsettos we normally use in RSS choir. YaY!! I got in! Hmm. He said only tested Gloria once and immediately accepted her. Good man! Janet got in too, but she doesn't want to be in choir. Hmmm.  After that we went back to the hall. The Orientation has ended! OO! I found out that Olympus is the Champion Clan! Yay!! Meow moo Championship! Hmmm. We met with our OG first, then we went off together. YH came to PJ to appeal! Good luck to him! Hmm. We went back together lor.  Midway,l Wendy smsed, said she has no moolah to eat. Since I got enough, I went down at Causeway Point and treated her to a MacDonalds Meal. Hmmm. We chatted and chatted. I also went up to look at that Gavin, her new manager. Hmm. I caught him. Wendy says I was lucky to catch sight of him. Hmm. He is somewhere between handsome and cute, I'd say. He scares me lor. I was helping Wendy tear strings ma, and he said something about me wanting to work here or what. I thought he was being sarcarstic, Wendy says he tries too hard to fit in. Her colleague, Su, later come and tell us that he cried today. O.O Wild rumors are spectaculating that he broke off the engagement with his China bride. I thought he was one of the cats who took a China bride through an agency and said "Woah? He so desperate ar?" and that sent Wendy and Su to laughter. Ohhh...Wendy said he knew the girlfriend for a long time, so OOO. I went down to buy TNP for Wend, then I returned home lor. Woah...it was almost 8 when I came back.  After bathing, I ate my dinner while being online. Hmmm. Now I am watching AI. Hmmm. Tomorrow the class list's gonna come out, and I am very nervous bout that.   Ahh well. I think I better end this blog. Woah, so long ar! Okay, see ya tomorrow. Night blog!
