That, and the fact that camp has finally started to wear me out.  I don't know what happened, the kids just seemed to get more wild and more disrespectful as time went on and it was extremely bad around Tuesday of last week when I had a little...problem...with my kids, we'll just leave it at that.  Pat says its because they knew me better the second week, but my explanation is that our group didn't have a CIT the second week and that contributed to a loss of control.  Whatever it is, I do have to say that the kids showed their usefulness when we played the Yellow Team in Laser Tag on Wednesday.  Let's just say that it was a total massacre.  Our team completely wiped out the other team two games in a row...I'm just so proud!  Well, today, I made the easiest $30 of my life.  All I had to do was read a few lines and go through some blocking for my mom's friend's play that he wrote.  It wasn't the best play in the world...Actually, it wasn't even close...but who am I to complain now that I am thirty bucks richer.  I think I  must have played about five roles in the read through, but that isn't unusual for me...cough, MUD, cough.  This is where I get kind of out of order because I haven't written in such a long time: In karate on Saturday, I learned the coolest form, or part of the coolest form, ever.  It is a bow staff form that involves whirling the staff very fast around my head and bringing down with a satisfying crack on the opponent's head...three times.  You should have seen me trying to learn it.  I got so dizzy I had to sit down at one point to stop my head from spinning.  But it was all worth it.  If any of you have seen the beginning of it, and I know some of you have, I finally added to it and now its even better.  Last night I saw one of the funniest movies ever.  If you haven't seen A Mighty Wind, do yourself a favor and rent it.  If you have seen any of the Christopher Guest movies (Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman, This is Spinal Tap) you really should seen this one.  Even if you haven't seen any of his movies and you have no idea what I'm talking about, you should still see it.  Get it now?  Its just that good.  Now back to today.  Tonight, my dad and I watched the Bourne Identity in anticipation for the Bourne Supremacy.  That is going to be such a kick ass movie I just can't even begin to explain.  Well, maybe I can...If the first one was as incredible as it was (and it was) then the second one is going to be just as good or better...and if it isn't...I will hunt down everyone involved in that movie and kill them Jason Bourne style...and you know I could too.  I'm so excited!  I think it comes out on the 23, but don;t quote me on that.  I'm going to try to see it as soon as it comes out.  If anyone cares to join me, you have to catch me first!  Well, that just about concludes our broadcast day, so leave me be!  Out
