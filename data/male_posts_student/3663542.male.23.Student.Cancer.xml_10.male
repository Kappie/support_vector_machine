Mainly because I just posted a comment on another blog site, and I had to do that as anonymous, and that's kinda tacky, so if for no other reason to get my name on the stuff I do. Besides I've been looking at them, er livejournal anyway, and it has some features that this doesn't have that I would desire unto myself, that this site lacks... Such as current mood, and music... Ah, I'm so indecisive!!! But this site has some sweet features, like I can edit old entries, have more than one blog, or chage the date of the blog anywhere from 1999 to 2006! (it would be awesome if I could do a blog from some time B.C. or impersonate someone like Pythagoras, yeah that would be awesome) anyway that was my rant on journals for now.
