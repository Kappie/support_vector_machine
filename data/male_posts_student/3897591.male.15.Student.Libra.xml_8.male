Aniwae, another thing tt i think i've changed alot... is tt i dun laugh much le....SO SIAN i love cracking jokes in primary school little kai xin guo but till sec 2 or 3 i stopped... dun even know y haha Do u think so ?  My biggest wish is to make alot of money lol wait.... biggest wish is tt all frens around me can be happy n had no trouble U happy I happy lol but it seems to me tt everyone had trouble tt i cant help much.... everyday in school pple r wearing mask pretending to be normal n jokes around when they reach home cry here cry there n think about sad things... sumtimes when i read others blog i will change my view towards tt person... looks like pple onli mention unhappy stuff on blog. hahaha Thus i wish tt all frens around me can be happy n had no worry May The Wind Of Laughter Be Wif You!! Alwaes Look On The Bright Side Of Life !!!
