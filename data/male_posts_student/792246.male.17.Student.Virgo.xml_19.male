It kicked butt. But everyone had to leave too fucking early. I felt like a sexual object. I got to sit on many peoples laps, Brad spanked me, and for some fucked up reason several people kept wanting me to be targeted in Psychiatrist. Hehe. And we had several minutes of discussing Cowboy Bebop! Woop de woop de doo! Supposedly the movie has its NA premiere at the expo today. Tis a good movie, though they picked on Faye too much.   PS Why does no one believe that I wrote and directed Roof?   ...I wrote "tis". I fucking wrote "tis"! This is not okay. Eiwjof'jioajdew[ekqpow. Okay, I'm feeling better. Anyways, I suck/ed at blogging, and the party in question is Jonathan's 17th birthday party I believe. Seanbaby is still gold though.
