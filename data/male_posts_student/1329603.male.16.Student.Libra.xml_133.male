Can I conceal my face for ever more? Pretend I'm not the man I was before? And must my name until I die Be no more than an alibi? Must I lie? How can I ever face my fellow men? How can I ever face myself again? My soul belongs to God, I know, I made that bargain long ago. He gave me hope, when hope was gone, He gave me strength to journey on... Who am I? Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean! And so, Javert, you see it's true, That man bears no more guilt than you... Who am I? 2-4-6-0-1!   Who am I?   from   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly
