Today morning i was reading a news bit in IE about the  urlLink whining  going on in the DMK head's mind.However, i never expected the solution to be so quick.Anyway once he had had his way, i wonder what will be Jayalalitha's plight now. He had got the Revenue Portfolio with him and many of the cases on Jayalalitha would have to be vetted by the Revenue department.Hope some wisdom will prevail upon the septuagenarian and he will understand that Jayalalitha was trounced in the elections precisely because of her  urlLink high handedness  when dealing with Political Opponents.
