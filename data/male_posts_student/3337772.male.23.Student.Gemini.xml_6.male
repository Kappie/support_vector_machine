I have had disputes with subway and train conductors on SEPTA, NJ Transit, and the PATH.  Now, people who work there know me, or know of me and my dog. Occasionally a really stupid janitor will go to me and scream about Lia. These people, I can handle. Not a problem.  If necessary, I can use my booming voice and scare them away, which does work actually...  I've had disputes with very few stores, mostly it goes like this - "No dogs here, sir, please remove your dog."  me - "this is a service dog, she's allowed here. (flashes id) (walks away)"   Now, there IS a reason I do not travel in philly via cabbies.   To make a long story, one which I could delve into details, short... I was with 2 friends and my fiancee in South St., Philly.  Lauren hailed a cabbie, who pulled over, Lia and I got in the car. Cabbie flips out. Cabbie won't read much less look at my ID. Cabbie flips out more. I yell. Lauren argues. Cabbie comes out of the car, to my side, opens the door and attempts to pull Lia out into incoming traffic.  I push. He goes for it again. Lia telepathically tells me to bite the motherf**ker. (I swear! that dog has some serious ESP, I swear... ) I bit him without even thinking, it was pure reflex.  Now, you're probably shocked?  Well, let's laugh.  Cops came, listened to me, ok.... cabbie flippin out, screamin I bit him... cop was like, the dog bit you?  cabbie says no, the GUY bit me!  2 more cops arrive, ask what's up... Cop explains to them... both were like, "The service dog bit the cab driver?"  cop #1 said no... the GUY bit him. which cracked them (and us) up.  The cop asks the cabbie if he'd touch a seeing eye dog. he says no, that's different... heh. So I pressed charges... turns out cabbie has no drivers license so. he be fucked.   Over time, within this blog, you shall read about similar, newer incidents.  I am not one to run, be fearful of others. I am the kind of person who solidly plants his feet to the ground, stands up for my rights and my beliefs, I am the kind of person who will say "No, I will not." I am the kind of person who has a city defense system. I always have something that one will never presume to be a weapon... which, in actuality, CAN be used as a weapon. Mind you, I always have Lia's safety in mind - in confrontations, if I feel physically threatened, like he's going to do something soon... Lia goes behind me. If a friend is around, the leash goes to the friend so if it is necessary, he/she can take Lia farther away from me so she will not get hurt. That has yet to happen.  Do not deem me dangerous; do not think my lifestyle is dangerous for Lia... Because her safety is my priority, as well as our rights.
