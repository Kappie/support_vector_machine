Oh...fuck I'm writing too late again, ok, it's actually the 23rd because once again I'm writing after midnight. Band practice outside today, it was awesome. We played Slither from Velvet Revolver and that's about it. Uh...what else, after band practice, Matt and I just rode bikes around and listened to Aerosmith. Damnit I definetly wanna go see them next year. Now here's Tom with war views.    urlLink Look  at the second picture down. War shouldn't exist. No son should be held from his father, but that's the way we roll our bones. I tear when I see that picture. I'm sick of it all, I'm sick of all the humans in the world that turn this world bad. Why are we fighting? Why are the Iraqis killing hostages? Why are there dictators? Why was America seduced into an Arms Race? Why are there conflicts? Fuck it all, you know what keeps me happy...THE FUNK AND SOUL...I STILL BE DIGGIN ON JAMES BROWN!!!
