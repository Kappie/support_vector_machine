Everyone hears what you say, friends listen to what you have to say but best friends hear what you don't say. I love Leon.  Have an economics test tomorrow. Am extremely frightened. Am very stressed with homework stockpile.  Have been feeling distant from Hazels' memory recently? Could I be moving on? Is it time? If it is, why is it? I'd wanted to be special, to be un-ordinary, to stay with my first love. Not to be? I can't find it in myself to accept that. We shared many special things. I'm disappointed when I think of how hostile she is.  Sat with Dawn and Joel after school. Dawn had cool hair today. It's coming back again. Rejection. The fear I grapple with. Will see if we meet tomorrow. Friends.  Good night.
