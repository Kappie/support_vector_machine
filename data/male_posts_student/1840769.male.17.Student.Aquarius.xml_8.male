Hope all those studying are faring well and doing their tutorials. This gentle reminder has been targeted aimed at a certain Mr Liu.  Really have nothing to write. Just a bit bored at home.  So yesterday was National Day. Thought it was one of the better NDP's in recent years. No cock-ups in the parade, yah? Any comments from our dear regulars? How did everyone find the NDP?  Oh yah, Ang Cai, when's the NTU GBCer's lunch with the Profs? Heard you've been planning since 26 July with no news as yet. Not efficient bro.... not efficient...  Anyway, will be seeing those I know soon. Cheers...  Boon ps. really sorry if i've bored you guys to death. I'm THAT bored!!!
