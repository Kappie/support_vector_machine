I wasn't sure what I was gonna do today but like usual, I ended up going to the JCC. Well none of my friends could go so I just ended up going with my little brother which isn't that bad. Right when I got there, I ran into Gabi, Britt, and Haley. I indirectly gave Gabi her ass whoopin in one on one so she now knows that I would destroy her lol. The J was fricken swarmed with hott chicks it was insane. They were eeeverywhere, left and right. I also talked to Chase Bano, and Candiss for a little bit so that was cool. I'm really tired right now tho cuz i was up late, once again Kristin woke me up sending me a text message at all hours of the night, but it was cool, I got to talk to Her and Kamel on the phone while they were in Alabama. Well right now, I'm eating a hot pocket...ok well now it's night and I just got back from Red Lobster, but on the way home we stopped at Handels, and no, I didnt get Reem anything, I'm really sore from lifting weights and this is my day...Peace Up
