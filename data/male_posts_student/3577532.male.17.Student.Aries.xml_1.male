Almost one per day. And to tell the truth I don’t really have any one to talk with about them; my friends do aren’t really into movies as I am and my family is totally clueless when regarding the cinema. That leaves only the web. That’s basically what I’ll do here – tell you all about the movie I just saw. How good was it, what did it make me feel and so on. I know, it’s kind of boring  . Now we go over to politics. As you might have already read on the side, I live in Israel. And well, I simply feel that the moderate left of Israeli society doesn’t get his stage on the web. I DO NOT hate Arabs, nor do I love them. I DO NOT hate my army. I DO NOT think what we are doing to Palestinians is just. That is what being a moderate left in Israel means {{I can’t find a better word for it in English. Will someone help?}}. Israel is not all about bombs and war. That what I’ll try to show here in this blog. Just a tiny bit of daily politics from Israel, from my prospective (otherwise you could just read it in the newspaper).   Well that would be all for now. I’ll be waiting for some comments on the topic/s of this blog. Hopefully, a connect post will be posted tomorrow.
