I will probably vote for the recently started  urlLink Junilistan  (homepage only in Swedish), a party with some right-wing EU-critics on the list. If you want to know how your opinions match those of the various European Party Groups, you can take the  urlLink Votematch-test .   My top 2:  1. The European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party   2. Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities
