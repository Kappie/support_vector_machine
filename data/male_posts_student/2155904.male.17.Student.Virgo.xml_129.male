The only thing separating Tyke from Monday/school is blogging, Love Line, and sleeping.  Before Tyke starts off, he would like to apologize to Piggy J for his absence on the list of friends that were present on Friday night at Purdy's.  That was an oversight on Tyke's part which he attempted to explain that he was out of it a little while blogging but that is still not an excuse.  But that is done with.  Piggy J is here now.  So today was a very lax day.  Beginning at 11 is quite nice.  Getting out of bed at 11:30 is even "quite nicer."  Tyke putzed around all day (Tyke says that a lot).  There was nothing he really wanted to do but it wasn't like he was bored.  He played ESPN, ate, talked online, played poker.  Everything but homework really.  But he didn't have any he doesn't think so thats cool.  He watched some of the Full House marathon and this other show on ABC Family.  Tyke doesn't exactly like that channel though but Full House is on it and that show Tyke does like.  But Tyke had a pretty nice Sunday where he just chilled with himself and played some good games.  A nice relaxing way to ease back into the week.  A week that will have more than 3 tests.  Tyke just realized he has multiple tests this week.  Not that he will have to worry about studying (cuz he doesn't care enough to) but just it is boring taking tests and not getting to have fun.  Side note time.  Tyke and Amed are talking now about age and grade and being young for their grade and such and Tyke just got to realizing something.  If Tyke's parents had decided to hold him back (he was born a week before the "cutoff" for schooling) then his life would be so much different.  Tyke would have driven his parents crazy they say cuz he was so rowdy and just never kept still cuz he was so ready to get out into the world.  But that is not even the most important thing.  Tyke wouldn't be friends with everyone he is friends with.  Some of the people he would probably still be friends with but really, the people he is closest to, he most likely would not be friends with.  And that is a depressing thought.  Because as much as Tyke kills himself thinking about what he is wanting but missing from his close friends he still does love them and would be sad if he got to know them but then didn't get to stay friends.  Wow, that is sad.  Tyke needs to move on.  So Tyke went to Refuge again tonight.  He is now a repeat offender.  Except you wouldn't use the word offender unless you were Tyke and trying to allude to something else that implies that some are against Tyke going to Refuge.  Did ya get that?  But Refuge is fun.  Tyke gets to have a nice little last hurrah on Sunday and see some friends.  But also he gets to think about his life and relationships.  Tyke, at this point, does not take so much a religious message from Refuge as he does a life message.  Some may feel they are the same thing but Tyke does not.  He has never been religious-or uber-religious either:)- so what he hears about God and such he doesn't really relate to.  He's not saying he won't at some point but right now he just relates to his personal experiences that are more relationship-centric and really, girl-centric.  So basically, Sunday nights are reserved for Tyke thinking about girls.  But not despondently.  In a beneficial manner.  Speaking of beneficial things.  Sleep sure is beneficial.  So maybe Tyke will go do that now.
