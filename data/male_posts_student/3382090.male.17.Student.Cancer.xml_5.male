I first encountered God when I was about 9 or 10, just through reading books and watching tv, and I don’t know why but whenever I needed something, or wanted something to happen, I would just pray and ask God to help me. And almost every time he would come through for me, as long as my intentions were correct. Sometimes not in the way I expected, but he would still be there to bless and help me in an even better way. I think this dependence of God, made it a lot easier for me to commit my life to him 2 years ago, since I already knew he existed, and I was eager to learn more about and to serve him.   I used to be a really anxious person, always looking for a source of security in my life, but now that I have God I know that I will always be taken care of. As it says in 1Peter 5:7, “Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you”, and it’s true, because I know that as long as I've done my part, God will always do the rest. It’s a really good thing because it’s made me a lot more relaxed person.  Also last year my school results exceeded what I could ask or expect. It shows how if you put all your trust in God you will be blessed beyond what you can imagine. So I thank and praise God for always being with me to guide me and to make all the troubles and problems I face so small.
