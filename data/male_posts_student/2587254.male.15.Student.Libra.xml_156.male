I got up at 11am today to get ready to go to Ken's place for HYPE meeting. So left around 1130, got some McD's, and then met Wendy and Josh @ UCC and walked to Ken's place.  We planned until about 230 or so then hit some badminton.  I got wrecked =P...  Now I'm really tired. I really hope that coffeehouse can be arranged with WLAC through Lindy, and Josh's friends. So yeah after today's meeting, all I can really say is sit back, pray, and just led God lead the way through the summer.  God, I know you're watching us everyday. Help us find the path that is yours, and not ours. It's Your will....not ours that is to be done.  Later.
