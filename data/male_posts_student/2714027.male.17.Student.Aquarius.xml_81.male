Couple that with some jobs involving greasy, dirty objects and you end up feeling positively filthy at the end of the day. A shower later though, and I'm okay, although so, so tired.  Talking of showers, the work on our bathroom begins next week and the mirrors in our current one have been removed, makign it feel five times smaller. The old mirrors pointed at each other, so it looked like the place went into infinity. Our spare bedroom/extension room is now full of stuff for the new bathroom, which the builders will put in over the next few weeks. It's going to be nice when it's all done, but next week is also the week when I have all my exams! Ah!  I did some revision yesterday for Geography - the exam for which is on Monday - and I'll be doing more tomorrow. It's probably one of the easier subjects I'm taking because it's more common sense and educated guesses than enything else; once you know the basic theory you're fine. Maths though, is a whole different 'kettle of fish'. (I don't know who would ever put fish in their kettle, but that's the phrase!)
