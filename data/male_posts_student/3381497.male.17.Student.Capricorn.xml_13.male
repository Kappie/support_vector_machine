Well I didn't get my schedule in the mail so I go there this morning to see what's up and I find out that they didn't even schedule my classes. One of them was pretty much a required class and I have to take it if I want to keep the classes I want for next year, which is gov't. The other one is Statistics, a class I need to take if I want be on the same page as everybody else for AP Calculus. I really can't afford to play catch-up right now. This is completely not my fault and is all staff error. I remember scheduling those classes with my councilor, I even wrote them down for her on a sheet of paper. Pretty much the only thing I could do right now is go again tomorrow, since that's the day people go to school to schedule summer school classes that weren't already scheduled.  To top it all off, I've been feeling really sick lately, I think it's a cold, but it's not like anything I've felt before. It's not really that bad, but I hate it, I also have a sore throat, that's even hindering my singing, I cough after every line.   The last 5 days have been hell for me, and I'm getting really easily irritated by everything. So to anybody that I've caused any greif to in the past week, I'm sorry.
