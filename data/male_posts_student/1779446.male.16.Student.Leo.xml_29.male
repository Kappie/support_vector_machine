Two people were hospitalised with minor injuries yesterday after the rented double-decker barge sank near Hippie Hollow, a lakeside park and the only public nude beach in Texas.  The accident occurred during Splash Day, a semiannual event hosted at the clothing-optional area by the Austin Tavern Guild, a gay and lesbian association.  Witnesses said that all of the people aboard the barge moved to one side as it neared Hippie Hollow, making it tilt.  Krista Umscheid, a spokeswoman for the Lower Colorado River Authority, said that although everyone aboard was accounted for, Travis County sheriff's divers were checking compartments of the sunken pontoon boat as a precaution.   ----------------------------------------------   The article can be found here  http://news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,9462199%255E1702,00.html  -----------------------------------------------   I just thought I'd post this up for your viewing pleasure. I stumbled across it a few minutes ago when I was searching up news regarding "Public Schools". I almost peed myself. Ah, how much can entertainment can one derive from the vices of idiodic americans. OH THE IRONY OF IT ALL!  LOL!
