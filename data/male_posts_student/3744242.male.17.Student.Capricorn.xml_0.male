Word of caution to everyone, never, I repeat, never put yourself in a position in which you have to take Fleet's Phosphorus; and if you ever do find yourself in that position, promise me you won't put yourself through the agony of the Ginger-Lemon flavored Fleet's Phosphorous.  It just isn't worth it.  But the worst part of this whole thing is that I really...really...really miss food.  The one thing I really want more than life giving oxygen right now is a large, Bazil's chicken parm sub, fresh from the oven...oh, now I've started drooling again.  Do you know how hard it is to watch eleven kids from 8:45 AM to 3:00 PM when you haven't had anything at all to eat...at all? Nothing but clear liquids and Jell-O.  Don't get me wrong...I could eat Jell-O and drink water all day if it wasn't for the fact that everywhere you turn, good, hot, appetizing food is being eaten.  I thought I would watch some TV to take my mind off the hole in my stomach, but did that help...NO!  It made it worse.  All I could think about today was Wendy's...Well, not officially (if you don't get this, get your nose out of that book and watch more TV!) because that stupid commercial is on every stinking break!  I'm going to cut this entry short today because I need to get up early tomorrow for the endoscopy and colonoscopy at Children's and I really don't think you want me to go into detail with what the medication is doing to my bowels.  So...leave me in peace!  Out
