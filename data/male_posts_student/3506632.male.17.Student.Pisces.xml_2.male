It made me start yawning during one of its earlier items (some Shao Lin Monks performance) by the time not even one award had been announced. Thanks to PTV this incident happened before even 7 o’clock in the evening had this show been telecast live at the usual late timings such shows have I guess it would have earned the distinction of putting to bed all of its viewers in a very short time span. Another eccentricity of the show was its host keeping on changing clothes. It’s like c’mon are you trying to suggest that this is a big budget show and we’ve got a large wardrobe. If yes then all I can say is grow up.  Yet I’ve heard that all people in the industry are saying that these awards are getting better every passing year. If it’s true either the earlier ones were a big no-no or the start belied what the show actually was.
