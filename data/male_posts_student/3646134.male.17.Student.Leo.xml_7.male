Not really gone anyone or done much :p this’ll have to be a quick post as even my normal insomnia’s caught up with me!  Yesterday, I got talking to Siwan online about various things… and somehow we ended up chatting for like 8 hours flat!  I felt like I really got to know her in that time, it was really nice :) I guess we just clicked!    Other things I've been doing... blah, working!  We're slowly eatting more and more complimentary food... getting upto about £5 a morning now!  haha.  And been out today with Rhys and Jonny B, then went back to mine for a bit... no-one's seen Wilson though!  Aparently he's been spending his life with his "girlfriend" (it winds us up that he can't call her by her name... he's just so amazed he has a g/f, he cant help calling her it!)... but no one's heard from him in almost months now!  Ah well, why'm I complaining, it'll be highly amusing when she dumps him to see his strategy of crawling back into our favour... oh wait, he never had our favour, he just liked to follow us round :p  Anyways, I need very large amounts of sleep... the insomnia's worse than ever!  Rarg!  I'm off to attempt sleep now!  nitey night :p
