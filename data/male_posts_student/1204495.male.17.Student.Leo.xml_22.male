I say dear too much! I call everyone dear. I called Smee dear, I called Naylor dear  that  freaked Trudie out. "Did you just call Naylor dear?!" Hee hee hee. Naylor with his damned camera, Vic get in the photo "Um, no thankyou dear" .....Trudie, Trudie, Trudie, aw bloody hell - that's just great, I just took a picture of my shirt. Hmmm, I just felt like writing. And I don't really know what to write. And heyyy, you said you were coming back at 9. Well mister, it's 9.53 now. I think you LIED. *gasp* hehehe. I did my FTT, for now anyway. They'll probably give me it back again, they always do..was going to say something then...then I remembered something. I'll carry on in mine. I need to rant a bit....AGAIN.
