However, I definitely wasn't expecting it to happen so soon, not even 24 hours later.  This morning, she called here and talked to my mom.  I don't know what was said, but evidentely she couldn't remember very much.  This led to my mom and my aunt going to take her to the emergency room.  My mom left here at 1 this afternoon and didn't come home until 10:30.  She called me once to ask me for a phone number and I could tell there was something wrong, it wasn't just a little stroke or memory lapse or something.  Anyway, when she got home, I was told that......they think my grandmother has a brain tumor.  Y'all, I know nothing about these things other than that sooner or later, they'll kill you.  And I also thank God that they're not genetic.  By the time they got to the hospital with her today, she could not remember who any of her own children were.  They ran a CTScan on her and said it looked like a tumor, and that it had been there quite a while, and it also showed that a few small strokes had occured recently on the upper right part of her brain.  Now, I do know that brain tumors are treatable, and in some cases, through surgery, totally cureable, but I don't know how good the outlook is for an almost 80 year old woman with a history of strokes.  Naturally, I hope that they will be able to operate and she will return to the full of life person she has always been.  However, if she is going to have to suffer for a long time, I kind of hope the Lord spares her, as my mom also said.  My mom also said there are some things she can remember fine, and that she can somewhat carry on a conversation.  It's just very freaky.  I'm trying not to worry about it, because I know there's absolutely nothing I can do about it, but of course, when something like this happens, it sticks in your mind regardless.  I just ask that you pray for her, as well as the rest of my family.  It is appreciated.  I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason, even when it seems horrible.  Ok, next topic.  Guys that treat girls bad are SHIT.  Yes, there are girls that I don't like, but no I would never say the stuff a particular dick said to a girl tonight.  Any guys out there that expect action from a girl, get over yourselves.  Build a relationship first and then maybe you'll get something, and you'll sure enjoy it a lot more.  I feel like posting the SOB's screen name on here for everybody to see, but I don't think I will out of courtesy for the victim of his asshole syndrome.  But this dickhead just pissed me off at the end of an already less than stellar day.  There is some other stuff I want to say, but I don't think I'll write it on here.  Ok I'm out...I need to press the publish button before I say something I shouldn't.
