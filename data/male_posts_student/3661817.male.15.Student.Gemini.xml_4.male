I passed out on the floor as the two played video games, i was still pretty damn tired. Once i awoke we waited for a it, and Danes dad took us to the mal. Dane wanted to buy the Hellsing epsidoes on DVD, but for 30 bucks for 3 episodes, he decided to wait.  We learned that we can watch full episodes of hellsing on Winamp via the Internet TV option. So we d/led that and watched some, and at that tiem danes computer decides to go insane.  After the mall and waht not, we went to subway, where my friend nicoel was working. O yeah...she made me the best sandwhich ever. (thanks nicole) i forgot to hand in my job application, but i can hand it in tommorow.  Once i got hoem i cleaned up my room and what not, and d/led winamp on my comp. Sadly the videos were laggy. So i went onto my moms computer and downloaded the program, and the videos ran great.  Uh yeah, so thats it, sat down and watched some anime. Nothing new, but tommorow is my brothers birthday, so me and the family are all going to dinner and what not.  Until next time.
