I can FLY. FLY. Yeah. Fucking FLY. I'm a hero. I go around fighting crime with my techonological wizardry and gadgets. I may choose to go around bashing evil with superstrength and magic later, there are so many freaking options it's stupid. Needless to say it doesn't suck. There's a fee involved, per month. Yeah, never wanted to do that. Going to though.  I've been a little stumped of late cause the game's just kicking my ass. Toughie, deal with it. A challenge is a challenge, wimping out ain't heroic. However, logging off to cool off and go back later ain't a bad idea either. It keeps you from going through excessive amounts of keyboards.  Secondly, got a new toy. Canon Elura 65. Canon did us a stupid deal on this thing. Got it for 21$ a month for the next little while. Stupid stupid good deal. It's incredibly sexy. I'm keeping a video diary to supplement the blog - maybe I can host and link to some of the clips.  Work's going well. I won employee of the month, I'm not sure what that entails. Apparently my co-workers voted for me. Cool. Best thing was - Glennis didn't win it.  The Atkins is going well. I'm starting to develop a six pack, that's kinda cool. A few of my friends are trying it out. It's working well for some of the people at work right now - that's great. A guy in computers dropped 7 lbs in 10 days. It's nice to be a positive force for people. The one thing that a few are having a tough time wrapping their heads around is the ongoing nature of Atkins. It's not a diet - it's a lifestyle change. You don't gain the weight back cause you don't go off it. That simple. Cool by me.  My backs' been bothering me a bit of late - from the accident oh so many years ago. I've got an appointment with the chiropractor tomorrow. Don't know if that'll do more harm than good. Who knows. We shall see.  It's nice to be posting again. Hopefully I can squeeze some more entries in soon.
