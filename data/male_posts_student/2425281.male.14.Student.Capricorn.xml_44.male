FAR OUT! *sigh* so then i had to withdraw from the bloody finals and the relay and today i skipped three periods of school and had to go to a physiotherapist at 5:30 >. and that other guy in hinder. but i deserve sympathy too *glares at wayne* so yes...bad first part of monday. after we got back to school, waited for like one hour for debating coaching to start and found out that the crappy team *us* had been kicked outta the comp all together so i joined shuyan/kiri/sammy's team. i'd like to thank them for giving me the opportunity to be involved in their debating prep and also the fact that i got TOTALLY freeked out when sammy wasn't there which meant i had to replace her as first speaker. thnk you very much kiri and shues. LMAO. prep was extremely stressful -.-;; i don't think i've ever been happier at seeing sammy...she saved me from displaying my crappy debating skills in front of the two good teams...*relieved* so yeh...although we went in with no case and two palm cards, we...or rather, they won the debate against the yr 11 team. shues, kiri and sammy need a confidence boost...*looks to their friends for support* so yes...a happy end to monday ^__^ congrats you guyz!!   now for today. got to school at fourth period for english cos my mum wanted me to go to physiotherapist in the morning --- they were fully booked but missing out on commerce is always a good thing ^__^ the rest of the day was extremely tiring as i experienced just how big a struggle walking down stairs with a sprained ankle is. ARGH! physio guy was nice -- thought i didn't know how to speak canto...and he put suction pad thingos on my legs...*tingly* afterwards, found out david jones had a half-yr clearance, met almericks sister and bought a $99 winter coat...$400 discount!! ^__^ so now i am...supposedly doing my japanese work...hehe. gnite pplz! yes i noe this blog is long..but at least i didn't split it into three! *glares at wayne..AGAIN*
