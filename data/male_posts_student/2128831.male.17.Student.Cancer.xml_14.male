So, thanks to the fabulous Jared, I have two poems today *Gasps!* I ran the mile yesturday and got 6:39, not that great but not to shabby!   I really kicked my ass hard when running damn this being a flexible individaul. Hahas, it was great times.  I talked to Jared's best friend Josh, he is a really nice guy, honest and funny as could be.  I remind Jared of his ex... Little creepy, neh? He says it is all good, and I trust him!  So about me being more flexible I did my yoga excerises!!! *Dances happy dance*  I got to pose 157 before I was tired,and the answer is yes to all that think to ask that question, no need the answer is *stands proudly* "yes, I can and what about you?."  Jared may come to Virginia soon *More happy dancing*  It would make me happier than a fat child in a candy store, of he came to see me! *drools lost in my little own world, (Jared you can join me if you like)..............* Ohh, where was I?  I don't reminder... well fine then to the poems...  The Club Dancing to the beat, circling in the clubs Circling amidst all of these club boy dubs Wondering if there is ever one not here for sex Scribbling messages of “---- me now” into text Questioning what I am doing here and now Taking in about all the vulgarities I would ever allow Grinding against one thousand and one losers All about “He’ll suck me off,” sex-cruisers While I for that one special someone seek Turning around there is one, sexy and meek Blonde hair in the way of sparkling green eyes Small stature I shuffle over nearer after many tries Watching him, small and cute, shifting his weight Staring all the while, internally I contemplate Standing here and now like water in the candle Thoughts over him, this is all that I can handle Slowly and surely, I place myself nearer still Gazing, watching all the more, my heart slowly starts to fill I brush against him: he turns and gives an affable smile My heart soars more and more all the while We turn together and dancing, wildflowers in my mind This one guy, green eyes aglow is the one I came to find I turn and ask him with my eyes if he feels the same He tells me that the burning heart he came to tame Silent questioned answer, my waist he wraps his arm Internally more and more chimes my alarm Filled by desires, he starts to caress, releasing scents At that point I drop all of my armaments I put my arms around him, thinking all the while “yes” He reaches slowly, gently down to my chest Our hearts intertwined, knowing we are right  Slowly moving downwards, his hands slide, holding tight He reaches firmly upwards and slides his mouth to my neck Desire for each other, different then the rest, burns like heck Our hearts swell like mad, 1 a.m. knowing that we must part Knowing fully that we are meant to be, together one heart My number to him with my heart, and his to mine  It is true and sad, shame to have so little time But, we know that we are meant to be off of first sites	 And, from now until forever, no more lonely nights   Eternal Rose A simple flower, pure and true Conjuring thoughts of me and you A flower stunning, beauty anew Alluring scent drawing me towards you A striking flower, glistening with dew Shining droplets like tears for you A flower beautiful, radiating through Reminding me of the warmth of you A budding flower, like a child’s coo Creating orgasmic feelings of you A flower scintillating, for me and you Tell me you will be the one to say “I do”
