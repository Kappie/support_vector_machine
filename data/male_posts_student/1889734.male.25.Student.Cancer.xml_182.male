Prop 54 would have banned the government from being able to collect data about race.  It would have been illegal to ask you that question on any government related document.  Sadly, it failed.    The funniest quote in the article is from Cruz Bustamante.    "Californians rejected Prop. 54 because they believe that discrimination is wrong in California. We must create a colorblind society, but we can't do that by putting blinders on government."   So to ignore color, we must observe color?  There was another interesting item I saw on the election returns, and it meshes with the race issue.  On the question of drivers licenses for illegal aliens, 73% of whites thought it was a bad idea, while only 7% of blacks and 17% of Hispanics thought the same way.  Racially, we all might as well be living on separate planets.  I can't understand this disparity, when the issue seems so obviously wrong.  But I'm just a white male.
