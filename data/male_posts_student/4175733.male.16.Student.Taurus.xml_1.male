Dylan is laughing so hard that he can’t respond.  I’m a little baked, so I think I hear Mozart’s  Moonlight Sonata  coming out of the little kid’s mouth in the form of birdcalls.  You think to yourself,  How can this be anymore fun then a movie?   How the fuck could going to a dance or watching television all night beat watching Henry try to rip the muscle linings out of a little kid’s face?  Dylan, please, I say, hold the camera for a second so I can go behind a shadow and jerk off or hump a storm drain with steam exhaling from it.  Dylan gulps some more air down, and responds in a very, matter-of-fact look on his face-  Don’t tease me, Maverick.   You can see the outline of Henry’s back as he pile drives the little kid into a dumpster full of fiberglass or asbestos.  Henry leaps back to the twig lying on the ground, kissing it profusely.  I am getting every second of this. I have enough battery power for another two fights- three tops.  I’ll make sure to send you all copies via internet in a few days.  Let’s mail a few copies to some television networks.  MTV must be desperate without jackass.  Oh man, you can hear Henry whisper, I thought I lost you, baby. I’m so glad I have you now. I promise I’ll never let anyone come near you again.   Promise.  Forever.  I love you.    How this came about was a few days ago. Dylan and I are baked off our asses in his basement playing video games. I’m not sure what game we’re playing, but I know I just launched a grenade into a chick’s arm, and she’s running around looking for her fucked up virtual parts.  Hardcore, comments Dylan. Dylan jumps over a bunch of barrels into a machine gun turret, picking off zombies or robots, screaming through his headset, Henry’s girlfriend is going to dump him any day now- wanna get some top-grade stuff and mix him up?  I stick a mine into a zombie’s chest and kick him down an empty elevator shaft. Sure, I say. It’s always good to get someone drunk after a brake up.  I think the zombie before the mine went off.  Damn.   Who needs to talk about your problems when you can ignore them?  The headset gets a lot of static feedback as Dylan obtains a power-up. His character is now four times as big. He’s running around with a copy machine, smashing a sadist robot’s head into her torso. The robot pants, and you can here her virtually come from her spinal column braking virtually. It’s hard to tell the difference these days.  Nah man, Henry accidentally keyed my car the other day with his spike belt stud thing. Dylan blurts out, I told him not to wear that retro shit. It’s time her got a fashion lesson.  I use a pre-recorded response because I’m too busy high jacking a cruise missile.  Chhhhhh… roger that . Some times it’s just easier to say yes. This is as I chuck an aborted fetus-grenade into a bathroom’s handicap stall.   Boom.  Splatter.   Do computer programs feel pain?    Do they like it?    Dylan sticks rides an office chair down a hallway while making lead salad out of zombie-lawyers with a machine-gun. Dylan, under the crackle of gunfire asks me where I saw myself 5 years ago, in my version of the future.  How could this ever be any better then getting a shit job and buying a beat up car? How could we ever have more fun playing cat and mouse with girls than unclogging beauty queens of their brain tissue in virtual reality?  Seriously.   As I climb up a rope, dripping with napalm. The thick substance slides down and burns my hands off. Falling, I’m losing all control in my blissful paradise. I respond, I saw myself studying hard to get into a good school.   As if the future is worth something to me, anymore.   Dylan’s watching me fall through his binoculars a thousand battles away, and he asks me if I remember the first day of Junior High School.  I hated Junior High. Everyone did. That awkward, watered down quality that you got at Junior High was like doing your food shopping in a Dollar Store. It was as awkward as finding true love at a Laundromat. It was as dirty as our thoughts. It was as blinding as the refrigerator light at 3AM.  This is as I’m gunning down a hoard of mutant girl scouts with a gun that shoots nails instead of bullets.  They look like nine or seven inchers from here.  Dylan asks me if I remember that first day of Junior High where the principle told us a piece of information that would last of the rest of our metamorphic teenage lives.  Over the screams of a thousand soccer practices and dinner specials, Dylan exhales as he sticks a cross, made out of sharpened PVC pipe, into a soccer mom’s skull. You can hear her frontal lobe go squish as Dylan says, “You are going to lose some friends, and you are going to make some these next few years.”  People ask me why I’m natural in biology.  We meet outside the front door of a bunker somewhere in the purgatorial field of battle, and Dylan takes off his helmet. No offence, he tells me, you were the last person I was expecting to hang out with after that speech.  No offence taken. I thought I was going to be a lawyer or a doctor or a girl magnet back then. Back then plus five.  In the year 1999’s version of the future. Where everything is white and the tech bubble never burst.  He upholsters his .357 and puts a slug into a giant floating squid that was 2 meters from my head.  Thanks, buddy.  I love my friends.  I love my honest friends the way you love constructive criticism. I love honesty the way you love your own twisted little shit life.  Who wants to be honest and live a real life when we can so easily slip away into a computer program or television?  Honesty is a thing of the past, just like Chivalry or bloodletting.  Outdated and fucking stupid.  You’re really the anti-Christ, you know that? Dylan leans against the wall and tries to fix his sub machine gun. I look over the scorched yellow fuck-fest that we call fun and tell him it’s about control.  I was sick of being told what to do.  I was sick of good grades and flash cards and learning to apply myself. I got to the middle of my teenage life and realized I hadn’t lived any of it.  I wanted to brake off. I wanted to hang out with the kids that scare me. The kind of kids that mothers worry about.  That’s  you , Dylan.  I had to trash my life to better understand and appreciate it.  Dylan smiles as he accidentally unloads a round into his foot and says, “Thank you, I’m honored.”  I bow.  I didn’t know you could bow in this game.  Fucking crazy.  Chucking his disloyal weapon, Dylan waves the miasma of smoke away from our faces and leans in. Maybe you’re onto something, man.  What do you mean?  Maybe, Dylan gags without his gas mask; maybe we really do have to destroy something in order to make it more beautiful. The way we buy more CD’s if they’re from artists who suffer from disease or violence.  The way members of the opposite sex who have scars seem more open and able to relate to.  He pauses for a second, and you can see a mushroom cloud being reflected off of his eyeballs. This is just like when you see the two mirrors at the barber shop that stretch into infinity. You just have to replace the conceited good looks with a near-apocalyptic not-so-distant future and you’re done.  I take off my mask and tell him, go on.  The way unforeseen fate is just easier to cope with then the kind that you know is slowly coming up from behind you.  Just like that, an ameba the size of a sport utility vehicle lands on us. We’re both disarmed and the ameba is sucking the protein out of us slowly. I give it a minute and twenty seconds before we die.  Watching Dylan’s body receding and yielding to a larger force, he looks like a martyr from some east African country in a civil war.  Dylan rambles on as our brains are put on spin cycle in a huge washing machine. Maybe through destruction we can learn to build something better with our lives. Maybe after we’ve done so much pointless stuff in our lives can we only blow it all up to enjoy it a little.    Self-sacrifice, Dylan says. We aren’t that different from all those nuns and Buddhist monks that can’t see their families and can never get any licks.   His skeleton pushing against his skin, Dylan tells me that whatever doesn’t kill us can only make us stronger. Whatever doesn’t make us stronger- we can learn from.   Everything fades, and we’re in Dylan’s kitchen mixing drugs into Henry’s glass. Just your basic hallucinogens and steroids. As Dylan looks in his Chemistry textbook for a quick reference, I dump my sister’s video camera into my backpack and my dad’s car keys.  Apparently when you use enough LSD, one can mistake objects for people. So a twig we found is going to be Henrys forgiving girlfriend. We’re going to pay some kids to try and take the stick from Henry.  This could be one big illegal waste of time, but knowing Dylan, we’re going to have some real special male bonding tonight. Tonight minus five hours.
