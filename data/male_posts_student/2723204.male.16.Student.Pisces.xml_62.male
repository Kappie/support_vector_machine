And cos' you don't need to ask why, I'm gonna say it now here. If you think you can get some juicy shit outta my personal life, the f off, I don't need some bastards to laugh, to be entertained by all the crap which I am going through.  I hate it when people laugh at my misofortunes. I hate people who feed on other people's sadness. I hate people who step all over you when you are the most down. I hate people who keep reminding me of something which I want to forget.  In fact I hate everything, you know what do I want to do now? I just wanna get amnesia, and forget every single shit that has happened. And if I can't, I don't know what can I do. I feel like shit, I really do. One part of me wants to reach out and tear the entrails out of people, another which craves for other people's love and affection and another which wants to crawl into my big black lonely hole.  Fuck everybody who gloat over my misofortune, fuck YOU if you're laughing. And if you see me looking like shit. NO I'm not thinking about what happened in the past. I'm way past those.....ohhh ohhh will she talk to me??? Ohhh ohhh she's frolicking with other guys, I'm so jealous shit. YOU THINK I CARE? NO FUCK NO! You are not any part of my life anymore. You know why I'm feeling like that? Well, I tell you why.  I regret liking you in the first place, i mean, yea yea its not your fault, really I don't blame you. And in fact this post is not directed at you. I know its me, I know its me, but its like what the heck can I do? Everything was so happy last time, when everything was so peaceful. You know what I feel? I exchanged joy which is lasting, and people whom I can depend on, for just a night with a prostitute. And guess who's the prostitute? its not you, its me.  Its like fuck, I've given many many many many things. I know its not your fault. My dignity, everything, I hate it, I don't hate you, I hate myself. I hate all that I've given up on. I hate all that I've exchanged all for. You know what? Even if you suddenly like me, have an about-turn, nothing would change. Cos' you know what? All i wanna do is to forget you.  Ohhh and please, its not those stupid romantic, ohhhhhh ohhh true love cannot be forgotten kinda shit. NO its not that, the fact is that I don't beieve in true love anymore. You know what? If true love is gonna be like what I went through, I'm not having any of that shit. I just want to forget the dignity which I lost, the hurts I've gotten. And please its not the love i can't forget, its the pain, and all the shit.  You know what? I heard that I can use a psycological technique called "locking" memories in order to forget. I wanna get amnesia.
