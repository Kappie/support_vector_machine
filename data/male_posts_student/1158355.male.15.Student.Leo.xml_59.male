I was amazed and happy as a pig in mud. Today in band, we had Mr. Andreas... ya remember him from the middle school? Tomorrow we have Mr. Kolar!!! I haven't seen him for a year so this is gonna be cool. He acts like a kid so that's why he's so cool. I forgot to mention the other day some dude had me play some huge hub cap with big mallet thingies and it was so much fun. Ya, all these teachers are trying out to take after Mr. Keye's spot on the job. He's retiring, RIGHT WHEN I GET THERE! WHAT LUCK I HAVE )=... I'm kinda depressed because I'm looking over all the rudaments and other crap I learned a while ago, and I can barely play them now, I'm a failure. Don't worry, I'll get my skill back in one day, things are like that with me, it takes me 2 seconds to learn something but then I forget it if I don't keep it fresh in my mind... or hands in this matter. Well, not having anything to write about went to a decent amount of music to talk about. Now me and my dad are going to watch The Matrix because he never saw it and wants to know what happens because he saw Reloaded. Ok bye.
