I told her I would talk to her later but she only had very stupid remarks like later I wouldnt be at home....at night I would be too tired to talk to you......if I cant talk to her at the point of time she wants......she gets super pissed off.........and one thing I hate is she getting pissed off at such stupid things.......here I am having my wonderful nap......... 1. Got woken UP.......... 2. Demanded to talk...... 3. Threatened to talk ...... 4. Told tat it is now or never......  If she wana try be difficult? Den fuck off and we can very well have a cold war today.......I aint gona try and give in........she cant expect to get her way everyday..........I had called her when I got home but was told she was asleep......I decided to let her sleep and go get my own nap........and what happened? When she woke up...she simply DEMANDED to talk to me.......  Second thing that is making me so upset?  1. Your gf calls out another guys name when making love to you..... 2. When asked who she wants to have sex with....she says his name..... 3. All this was not said once but many times........  Somehow I feel very sick in the stomach yesterday.......she was being all lovy dovy and only I guess my love prevented me from slapping her on the spot when she said all this......and what was her reply to her behaviour? She was talking nonsense....and I am being childish......  I really wonder.......repetition of answers are not nonsense....nonsense are random acts.......I really question if I did the same thing to her how would she feel? Somehow when we evaluate feelings.......she takes mine for granted......when I realise I have hurt her.....I always try to make up to her........  Does she realise the hurt she has caused me?       Quote of the day: "None, too upset to think of one."
