"All of You is more than enough for all of me For every thirst and every need You satisfy me with Your love And all I have in You is more than enough  You are my supply My breath of life And still more awesome than I know You are my reward worth living for And still more awesome than I know  All of You is more than enough for all of me For every thirst and every need You satisfy me with Your love And all I have in You is more than enough  You’re my sacrifice  Of greatest price  And still more awesome than I know  You are everything You're my coming king And still more awesome than I know   More than all I want More than all I need You are more than enough for me More than all I know More than all I can say You are more than enough for me"  Just kidding, I don't listen to secular radio (unless you count laura ingraham).  Actually, I heard this song in a church.  The people in church thought it was about Jesus.  If it was on the radio(I don't know if it was), people would think boy/girl.  Who is to say which is the right interpretation.  All I am going to say is that a song to God/about God should at least mention him.  This is not winning anyone to the Lord(which is supposedly the purpose of "Christian" artists getting their music played on MTV and such like but I would like to point out that music is not for evangelization but for worship.)  Also this song is not evangelizing anyone.  Its a boy/girl love song.  Christians fall for so much dumb stuff.  Time magazine said "The message of  Friends , in other words, is that there is no normal anymore and that Americans--at least the plurality needed to make a sitcom No. 1--accept that."  So many Christians watch  Friends  because its "funny" or "entertaining" but they "don't support it's beliefs".  By watching a show, you say you are fine with what goes on in it.  Time realizes that.  Why can't Christians?
