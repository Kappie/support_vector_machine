I was going down a hill that eventually turns into main street, while going down the hill, I noticed that my breaks were acting just a little bit funny. As I turned the corner I saw a car and slammed on my breaks. Nothing happened. I now have a bent up car, with no damage to the opposing vehicle. My whole front bumper is nearly trash. But I dunno yet if it can be fixed or whether or not it has to be replaced. We will see later...
