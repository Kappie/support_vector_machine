Upside down  Like a bullet From a gun Can of spam Bettery hen It's a lie Tell the truth No good news Good news How can we lose Here's the groove Here's the song Number one Fat chance  Oh now Look what you've done Only the meek Only the meek Everybody else Left last week  Crop spray Crops have failed Northern lights You're a freak I'm a creep I'm weak Hide and seek It's the meek  Left out of the will Everybody else On a ship to the stars Birds are gone Gulf stream Nothing to drive No whales, no plankton  Resign You're a disgrace Resign, you're a disgrace  Your grace Your grace Resign  Those to the left of you Those to the right No one believes a word of it You know you're talking shit  You are a disgrace Resign, you're a disgrace Your grace  Your grace Your grace  Your grace
