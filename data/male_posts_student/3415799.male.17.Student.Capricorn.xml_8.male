Unless you have given blood before i'm pretty sure that you have no idea how it feels to know that you are going to give someone another chance at life by helping them stay alive. I walked into the local town where i would donate in the morning - its about two miles and it was a beautiful day so i thought why not. Along the way i did not feel fear, worry or dread - the only feelings i had was excitment and pride because i know that at the end of the day i may have saved someones life.  The process is not all that painful, just have a lie back and have a sharp pain in your arm that lasts about a second then wait about half an hour and then you can have a nice wee cuppa and feel good knowing that you've done something amazing.  I don't mean to be pushy but due to research showing that variant Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (vCJD)can be transmitted in blood if you have been donating around the early eighties, the NHS are really crying out for blood donors - so i am urging you to do something for today to make yourself feel good and maybe save some lives by donating blood. Give an hour of your day to perhaps give another person life...please.
