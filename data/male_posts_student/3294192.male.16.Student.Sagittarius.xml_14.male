We are all the same in the eyes of those who would hold us back."  xoxo - urlLink New Khantra Album    I'm feeling much like a fuck-up, but I'm a 16 year old boy, so I guess it's not uncommon. The idea of summer is starting to depress me, as I think of all the crap I'll have to do to make up for mistakes I could've avoided. I have to take 6 classes to make up for an F in Health, all of which will most likely take time away from my film course. I have to pay $100+ dollars to fix my car which I managed to crash into myself. I need to pay to replace my brother's $400 bike which I left unlocked, and is now in someone else's possesion. I need to somehow also pay for $800 of car insurance. All this money, is coming from I don't know where. Would've come from a job had I put more effort into getting hired, but no, I guess I screwed that up too.  Tonight, I would've liked to be out with some friends, but my mother doesn't want me to leave my house after 10:40 because, she doesn't want me to. She can't explain it using any logical reasoning other than I need to clean my room. Makes no fucking sense.  Breakfast is always better with friends, and so are video games.  urlLink Kirsten  is the perverted type of girl who just likes to watch, so I played up to  World 3  in Super Mario Brothers 3 for her. It was fun. World FUCKING 3. That amazed me. We also listened to her nice music, and watched my favorite music video.
