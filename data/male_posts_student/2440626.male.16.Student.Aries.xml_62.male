I mean Los Angeles in less than 2 weeks,  Harry Potter 3 premiere this friday; does it get much better?  Oh and another good thing: Blogger just released a Photoblogging program so now I will be able to post pictures.  Look for some awesome photos in the future.  Well I have to go get a haircut.  What fun....
