My friend Matt heads up the project, although the web-mag sports a number of contributions from his friends (most importantly  me ).  First, go check out  urlLink www.thenewcelebrity.com .  After doing that, come back and read the next paragraph.  I'm impressed with Matt's work.  The  new celebrity  is definitely a work of visual and literary art.  I think it is a real show of creativity and artistic talent.  Still, I was somewhat frustrated with this latest issue.  It took a long time to load the pages on my dial-up connection, which was exasperated by taking several attempts to learn how to navigate through the pages.  To be honest, I'm not even sure if I've seen everything on the latest mag because the navigation through it is confusing.  I'm also a little perturbed by the fact that Matt axed (in my opinion) my brilliant contribution to the mag and he published my weaker contribution.  While I am impressed by the new format with its fusion of new images and fonts, I found it difficult to read some of the entries or follow their flow.  Maybe I'm just not postmodern enough to get it...  Returning to the positive side, I thought Josh's piece on how to write a composition was a creative and humorous commentary on writing.  Indeed, this was probably the strongest piece in this edition.  While part of me longs for the format of the first issue, I'm hopeful that the new issue will grow on me.  (After all, when I first heard Pearl Jam's  No Code  I hated it, but now I love it.)
