I've got to close tomorrow (payday) and then work the middle shift on Saturday, but when I get back Saturday no one is going to be around to hang out with when I finally have time.  Sunday I finally have a day off, and I think the schedule for next week is changing.  Oy vey.  I think I finally finished the program I was writing to Sesame incentive programs for the line employees in Photo.  I'm still debating whether or not to allow them to use it since I'm probably not going to get paid for the time I put into it.  Maybe I'll email a copy to FujiFilm and August Busch.  See, incentive is everything - no money, no program (maybe).  Sadly, a corporation which employs thousands of people can't understand that.
