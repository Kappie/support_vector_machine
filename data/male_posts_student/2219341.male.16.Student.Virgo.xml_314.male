WHY CANT I GET OVER IT?!  i dont know what else to say.  i dont think i've been this upset in a long time.  goodness.  i want someone to relate to.  i want someone here that i can talk to... who will just understand me.  and i hate... yes i hate being judged.  being stuck into a category simply because i am what i am.  and yeah its probably stupid.  it really is.  i really should just ignore what people say and just live my life, but sometimes it just hurts so bad.  i guess its not the fact that i am being judged.  its usually what i am thats being judged.  and i despise that.  not so much because its mean... more because it makes me feel so bad.  i dunno.  not many things can lower my self-esteem... other than my Dad and this.  i feel so terrible... and i shouldnt!  AHHHHH!  I DONT UNDERSTAND MYSELF!  ok... i'm gonna stop before i hurt myself.  goodnight kids.
