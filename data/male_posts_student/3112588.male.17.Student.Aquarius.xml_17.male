(suicidal mood).....at least i wont have a chance to kill myself today--dont want to stain natalie's rug or anything. im too emotional i think--thanx for all the guys who supported me when i was little-->SOB's (hope im not bitter....)--today just was not a good day, i had to come home and scream outside, then move on with life. ill have my cell phone, so call me if you want--i really need someone to talk to. (407-1700) thanx bye  CONTINUED-- ive been doing this lately, but what im doing is if i write early in the day before something happens, i continue if something changes! well, had a good time with natalie and alex working on chem project (they both fell asleep) LoL!!! alex-natalie--you 2 are WAY TOO MUCH LoL! its all good though--we got hecka stuff done, and the power point looks good--but thats b/c i did it! good times at Wendy's today though guys!! the old ppl must have been hating us by the time we left! haha!! natalie--huge birds (RAPTORS-WE CAN EAT THEM) LoL! funny enough, our project was on LSD, and the ppl in Wendy's thought we were on it hahaha--and alex...we had good times singing outkast while natalie was sleeping with "squirtle" (HAHAHAHA)!! but the best part was when natalie and alex were sleeping, and natalie's mom walks in the house, and looks at me and goes: uhhhh--hi LoL!! she met me before, but it took her a while--a stranger in my house good times! anywayz, they cheered up my day, and the Lord surrounded me with ppl who would cheer my spirits. its about 10:40 pm, and laura and i are going to drop off our checks for drivers ed tomorrow--laura, no talking in class LoL!! yeah--right hehe
