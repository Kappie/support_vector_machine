Sigh...but at least in the evening i tried to study my Advanced Level Physics Txtbk as a last saving grace. Finalli studied all the CT topics for physics inside dat txtbk, includin mechanics, forces, moments, thermodynamics etc.   Still, there's but 9 days left to the CTs...and SO I've pledged once again, to dutifully complete a whole-nite study marathon tonite. Havent done it for a long time...miss me, caffeine? Time to get those fashionable panda eyes...heh. Tonite, I'll study the maths notes first, then finish the rest of some fiendishly diff. math xtra qns.(they reputedly took my fren 3 days)   Oh no, its 10.30...gotta sign off n start studyin. See ya.
