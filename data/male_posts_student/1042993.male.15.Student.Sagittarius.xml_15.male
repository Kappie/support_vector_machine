Leo Laporte has officially announced his resignation of lead-host of  The Screen Savers , a "geek-powered" show made originally by geeks for geeks.  After hearing about ComCast's acquisition of TechTV from Vulcan Enterprises, Inc. I realized that the network would never be the same, but I never thought it would force the network's best host out of his position.  Leo says that he will remain host of  Call For Help until further notice, but will take on a "diminished" role in TSS.  Within 90 days the ComCast acquisition will be official and ComCast will have complete control over the company.  Comcast has also announced that they will be merging the entire TechTV network with  G4 , a Comcast channel dedicated solely to gaming and the gamer's lifestyle.  Somehow, none of this surprises me...  After TPTB cut back on TSS' on-air time from 90 minutes (1hr 30 min) to 60 minutes (1 hr), there was outrage in the TechTV community.  After that decision was made, the viewing audience dropped out by at least 40%.  I have remained a TechTV fan up until this point.  In fact, I was a fan at the very beginning (when the network was called ZDTV).  I have been a fan from the  very first episode of TSS when Leo was hosting the show with Kate Botello (who has now left the company).  From this point onward, I cannot remain a true TechTV fan.  I will not remain a part of an organization or community that allows such things to happen.  TechTV has been a major part of my geek-life.  I have been a TechTV / ZDTV fan now for 6 years (from beginning until now).  TechTV performance and show quality has dropped off a lot in the past 2 to 3 years.  Leo left Call For Help and Chris Pirillo joined the company, The Screen Savers was reduced to a meager 60 minutes, TechLive became a major part of the network, Leo became more "commercial" in his activities with TechTV, Kate Botello left the network and Patrick Norton was made replacement for her; and the list gets longer and longer as I think about all of the horrible things that have happened to this once wonderful network over the past few years.  I will continue to post updates about the merger, but I will no longer be an active fan of the network if things like this are continually allowed to happen.  We must put a stop to this...
