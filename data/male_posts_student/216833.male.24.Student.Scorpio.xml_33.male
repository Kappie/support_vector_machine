I took a shower to help me feel a little better, it did, but I couldn't shake my mind from constantly tearing me down.  What do you think about yourself?  Most of the time I am very critical of myself.  I guess I set my self up for failure alot.   It's a new day, that makes a world of difference.   Girl Scout cookies are soooo good.
