Chemistry test wasn't completely unbearable. Aside from the fact he put a whole page on the test full of material he said specifically wasn't going to be on it. But who cares anyway. 12 days left. Or something around there. Whatever. I'll take my hat off to this great cd. That great cd would be The Used. Hey I just remembered tomorrow I'm going to New York. That sorta brightened the day until I remembered that it's for Spanish. I love how teachers ruin trips by making us do assignments relating to the topic. I'm more interested in going to New York and just walking around and taking in all of the art instead of searching and wasting time looking for Spanish art that I'll have to write about. To tell the truth, all I'm excited about is gettin out of an entire day of school.  And  tomorrow would be a double period of Chemistry. Thank the God watching over us, for he saved me from a certain demise. Any more Chemistry will probable drive me into insanity. It was a rough year, but it's almost over. Went quickly though. But I'll never forget you 2004. All of your good times. *Sniff* Yeah this year was just the same as every other and I doubt I'll ever look back on these years for happy memories. But overall I can't complain. Raise your drinks and make this toast to another fair year. Hurrah.   Listen to H.I.M.
