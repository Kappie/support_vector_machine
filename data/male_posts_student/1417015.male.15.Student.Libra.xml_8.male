These holidays have been great, because I've done more-or-less what I want to do, and when I want to do it. With my parents being out of the house alot, and my brother sitting in his room putting on weight, things have been good. I've been going to bed late, and getting up late, and I still can't remember the last time I slept over the passing of a day. However, I think I've completely fucked my sleeping pattern, and it seems now I've somehow brought on the old insomnia. I didn't get a wink of sleep last night, and because there is no curtains or window cover in any form in the attic room at my dad's house, I saw the rising of the sun at about half-past four. Which is just irritating, to be honest.  I digress. The point is, these holidays have been good, and I can't go back. I'm not prepared at all, not least in that I have tonnes of unfinished / undone / unstarted  homework. Chances are I'll get very little sleep tonight, and I'll be in the worst of moods when some up-her-own-arse student teacher asks for my RE coursework first thing in the morning. That I have to face another 6-7 weeks until the summer holidays is an awful thought, and I just feel like crying.  FUCK.
