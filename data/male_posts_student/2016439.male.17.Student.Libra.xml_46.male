I spent it with some great friends (Rachel, Jenny, Alec, Emily, and Sara Hills), and we all headed over to Chloe's (Rachel's) in our formalwear.  Do not ask me why, because I couldn't give you an answer.  However, I'm sure that Chloe and Jenny were behind it.  Hmm...It was great, though, because we went out to eat at Gratziano's, an Italian restaurant, which was nice.  The real fun started happening afterwards, when we walked over to Heritage Square singing at the top of our lungs and, gasp!, jaywalking.  Oh, it felt good to be a rebel and break the law by  jaywalking .  How cool is that?  LOL.  Well, we took a couple of pictures before heading to, of all places, H-E-B.  We wandered along the aisles aimlessly for a couple of minutes before Jenny gave the stop purpose by bying some random dress/bridal magazine, or something like that.  We headed over to Jenny's house and watched  10 Things I Hate About You , which I've never seen.  It was okay.  Jenny and others proclaimed it to be the best teen movie, they'd ever seen, but American Pie (1, 2, and the yet-to-be-seen 3) still has my heart ;-).  After finishing the movie, we headed back to Chloe's house and played Dutch Blitz--an awesome game!--for a while before counting down the New Year.  We ran outside and blew noisemakers that didn't work and fired little crackers (not FIREcrackers, but just crackers) and watched the fireworks from the distance before going inside to play my new favorite game: Mad Gab.  I seriously need to play that game again.  I was determined not to have a New Year's Resolution this year, but while I was at my grandmother's house wandering in her enormous backyard, I came up with one.  This year, I'm going to pursue what I want with everything that I am, which basically translates to: I'm not going to be a half-ass (pardon my french), like I've been in the past.  If I want to get into NYU, I've got to get off my rear and get into gear, because $40,000+ isn't just going to fall in my lap (though I really, REALLY wish it would).  So, that's what this year is dedicated to: doing what I have to in order to get what I want, which is to go to NYU.  I'm nearly certain that I have everything else except the money to back up getting into the school.  It's really scary, but this is the last full year before I go to college.  How crazy is that?  But do you know what I really say?  Bring it on.
