But hey, we just relaxed, spent time on the beach, rode ghetto go-karts ( I only broke 3 vertabrae) and yeah....all sorts of good stuff. Best story of the trip. One day we went to go look at these very cool new condos built right on the beach in Westport. My mom falls in love with this one on the 3rd floor (highest floor) and decides we need to invest in it. So she just about went and dropped half a million dollars on this condo...too bad my dad talked her out of it. Oh well, i'm sure we'll find another way to spend 500 g's. In other news...I'm still not tan, and senior pictures are on Wednesday. Not too excited about that one. And I'm officially excited/depressed because school starts in less than one month, and I have not yet begun to shop for school clothes. And I just discovered that today, well yesterday was Friday the 13th....crazy weird.  Tomorrow (today), I'm going to see Man of La Mancha at the theater. Alex and Emmy are teching it so I have to see it all by myself....I'm sad. And on tuesday my cousin from San Francisco is flying in to spend some time here. She's cool, but she's my sisters age. So they hang out a lot...apparantly I'm obligated to go to the airport...hmmm....not cool, but its all good. So that's all I got. Y'all better call me so I can have some stuff to do. That's all I got homies!
