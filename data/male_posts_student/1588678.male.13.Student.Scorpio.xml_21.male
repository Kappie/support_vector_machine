Excellent weather, excellent line-up, and excellent performances.   The performances were in this order: Neil Young, Dashboard Confessional, Wilco, Counting Crows, Indigo Girls, Incubus, Pearl Jam, Willie Nelson, and Crosby, Stills, Nash,  Young. Each band played about 5 songs taking up about 40 minutes.  Neil Young - Simply great! If there’s one man who can manipulate an acoustic guitar, he’s the man! He played I think 4 songs. He opened with the song “Sugar Mountain.” After a couple of songs he had Native American dancers join the stage to dance to the song “There Comes a Time.” It was real cool. The main dancer was in a red and white bird feathered coat with a big-old feathered hat. That was amazing! Plus, Neil Young seemed to have a sense of humor. At times he’d make some funny remarks that kept the crowd happy.  Dashboard Confessional - They were okay. The band is good and all, but the singer got annoying after a while. Some of their songs were good and some make you want to pull out a 12 gage shotgun and shoot that mother up! Believe me when I tell you that I didn’t go to see them. I ain’t no loser. They played like 4 or 5 songs and that’s 4 or 5 songs too many. Hehehe.   Wilco - One word; awesome! Going to the Bridge School, I was really looking forward to seeing Wilco. They put on an awesome show. They only played one song from the album “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot” which was a bummer. That was a great album. They may’ve played some of their old stuff, but I’m not 100% sure on that. What made them stand out the most was the fact that they didn’t sound different from their albums. I mean, Pearl Jam makes albums with a lot of electric guitar and it’ll sound different when they play those songs acoustic, but Wilco does acoustic for their albums so their sound wasn’t different. I liked that. They’re pianist was very good too! In fact, the piano works well with the band. Other than that, they were real good.  Counting Crows - Good. No complaints about them. They played all of their good songs. They probably played 5 songs. They opened with “Rainman.” It was really good. They lead singer also had a good sense of humor. When he played “Long December” on the piano, he had the wrong beat in the middle of it and stopped the whole performance and said, “Let me try that again.” Then he finished it with the right beat. I was expecting to have Vanessa  Carlton perform with Counting Crows on the song “Big Yellow Taxi,” but they didn’t even play that song.    Indigo Girls - Not much to write about them. Crappy songs and very annoying. The main guitarist was good though. Most girl guitarists just play cords, but she was wippin’ out some radical notes lemme tell ya. They probably played 6 songs. One of the songs was way to long. It’s called something like, “The Chicken Man.” Judging by the name of that song I knew it’d be a spoon full of ass kind of song.   Incubus - Not much to write about them either. Their songs seemed to go on forever. They played like 6 songs. They opened with “Driven” or “Drive,” whatever it’s called. They have a good guitarist but a  crappy singer. The first minute of his singing annoyed the hell out of me. Other than that, they weren’t all that good.  Pearl Jam - Oh yeah!!! AWESOME! It was my first time seeing them live and boy, it won’t be the last! They opened with the Bob Dylan song “Masters of War.” In fact, Pearl Jam played a lot of covers. Some of the cover songs they did were: “I Believe in Miracles” by the Ramones and a tribute to Johnny Cash by playing the song “25 Minutes to Go.” They also played “Daughter” and a new Pearl Jam song called “Man of the Hour,” so I guess this means we’ll be seeing a new Pearl Jam CD on the racks hopefully soon. Eddie Vedder actually dedicated the song “Last Kiss” to his “girlfriend,” Mary, who now attends UC Berkeley. Eddie said to Mary on stage, “I told her that we should keep it touch, but she said ‘I’m not good at writing back’ so we’re going to have to work on that.” That was truly a nice thing for Eddie to do.   Willie Nelson - I bow down to the living legend and I mean it. Willie kick-ass! He was so amazing and he can play guitar like no one else. It’s great, he plays this acoustic guitar from the 50s with thousands of autographs of the people he’s performed with along with friends. This no pick-protector on that guitar so most of the coating on the guitar has been chipped off. And the man doesn’t stop! And I mean, DOESN’T stop! After he finishes a good 3 minute song, he waits not even 10 seconds before he continues on a new song. That proves how capable he is to just take the performance to a whole new level. And he too had used a good sense of humor with the crowd. He just seems like an all around good guy. For the 4 or 5 songs he did, he performed with style and grace at the same time.  Crosby, Stills, Nash,  Young - Best EVER!!!!! They were the best act of all 9 acts. They were amazing! Whether Neil Young is rockin with the harmonica or Steven Stills in jamming a spectacular clash of notes and cords, they all hit it out of the park! They all did wonderful songs including a very good performance of “Déjà Vu.” Also a wonderful song they played was the Buffalo Springfield song “For What It’s Worth.” Other songs played were “Harvest Moon,” “Our House,” and “Teach Your Children.” In between their performance, David Crosby told the crowd, “In this band we all have jobs. My job is to write the weird shit.” That was great! The performance of CSNY seemed like they all said to each other to pick a song to play. That made the performance great too! All and all, they were indeed the soul performance of the night, no doubt about it.         Well, the Bridge School Benefit Concert this year was amazing! So here are my grades for each band and why the got the grade they got. And if you don’t know what * means, it’s a star. Neil Young - **** because he didn’t play a lot of songs. Dashboard Confessional - *** just because of the annoying voice of the singer and some of the songs were badly performed. Wilco - ****1/2 because they didn’t play a lot of stuff from their latest album “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.” Counting Crows - ***** because of the songs they played and their ability to put on a good acoustic show. Indigo Girls - *** just because they had a good guitarist. Incubus - ** because they suck! We’ll their songs seemed to drag forever and the singer was crap. Pearl Jam - ****½ because they didn’t play a lot of their songs. Willie Nelson - ***** basically because he rocks! Crosby, Stills, Nash,  Young - *****! They were amazing!!! They were the best of any of these bands! So if you got enough money go to the Bridge School Benefit Concert. If you love rock n roll, you’ll love the Bridge School!
