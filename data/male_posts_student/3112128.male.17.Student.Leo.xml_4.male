It can be reduced to no absolute and as such, it can be reduced to nothing comprehensible. As all absurdity is, the universe is to be disagreed with. It is known that there exists a ‘space-time continuum’. This continuum must be ignored in all its deterministic qualities. Time is subjective and we should ignore its presence. We can learn nothing from the past, just as we cannot predict the future. Release all rationalistic thoughts. We can sense what is here and now and this is all the knowledge that is needed and is obtained for a meaningful existence. Existence is in the self and the self is in existence. Consequences are false- ethical questions; created in the past and left in the past.  Intrinsically flawed are those who search for meaning in life, for "love" is "hate" when "love" and "hate" are merely words. All acts warrant success, virtue and truth. That which is true and great is merely that which is.  Life and death are inherently illogical concepts, for now is all that matters. Remember not those from the past, as they will not remember you; but instead live to please the greatest entity there is:  you .
