The study followed about 1,000 people from the age of three into adulthood, and found that those who had consistently spent more than two hours a day watching TV between the ages of five and 15 were at increased risk of being overweight, having high cholesterol, and poor cardiovascular fitness.   British children watch an average two and a half hours of television a day, with many watching more."    Funny what entertainment can do to us. Showbusiness may be glitzy for the people appearing in front of the camera, but what about the children who have been indoctrinated into thinking that TV is fun. Who does the parenting these days? Where do we get our values from? Is it really that fun, knowing that you could not miss an episode of Friends, would love to marry a character from Eastenders, would shriek with delight if you laid hands on a TV star?    We were OK without a TV once you know. Tell me; how does the TV enhance your life, what does it bring to the plate that you so cherish? Having been conditioned to operate as if something was fun for so long, we unswervingly hold onto this fun idea and carry on laughing regardless of how empty we feel. Do we hate silence; surrounding ourselves with noise. Do we hate reality; craving for a slice of fantasy. Do we hate problems; looking for unproblematic solutions. Do we like canned laughter; the hollowness of its ring.    I remember one especially awful Christmas in my life. It was a Christmas without mum, as she had flown to Finland for some work. It was me, Ilona, and Daddy O deceiving ourselves that Christmas telly was Oh so fun. I remember breaking down in tears one night, because the marathon telly-thon was leaving me soulless, without nourishment, void of goodness, and completely dry.    We exclaim to ourselves, why are we lonely, depressed, and suicidal, now more than ever before! The wells we drink from serve up poison, our cisterns are empty. If TV is fun then let us conclude on an interrobang!?
