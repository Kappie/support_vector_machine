I am afraid we misuse the word God not as He intended it for (edification) but for rather more division and hurt. A member at the church where I attend was talking about a negative experience he had with another congregation, he said this church "kills its wounded."  I am sure this is notwhat Paul had in mind when he wrote Ephesians 6.  I think today's church is playing not to lose what we have already achieved instead of winning the world for Christ.  Of course, all these are generalizations, but I need to remind myself we serve a living God.  In order to engage in his work we must have a living faith, willing and able to face each and every challenge which comes our way.  CS Lewis was once supposedly quoted as saying "Christians do not ask for too much, on the contrary we are satisfied with so very little."  I disagree with the assumption of Christianity has been tried and found lacking, NO it is my belief it has not been fully tried.  I am sure these are naive ideals and there are easier to write than to live, yet we must spur one another on this endeavor which God has called us.  I am tired of the deadness of legalism and human arrogance, Precious Lord, let these words be like Scripture  living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, able to penentrate enough to divide soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. (Hebrews 4:12)
