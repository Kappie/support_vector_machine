The world has changed so much, Yet I change so little, Morals and goals are long forgotten, "Live in the moment!" they say. The ties between sanity and I are brittle.  God, I need you now, Give me the strength to keep on, To move forward everyday of my life, To trust, love, and live the way you wanted me to, Keep my faith together before it's gone.  The ring upon my finger is but only a part of my beliefs in you, But I put upon it many different meanings of life, It shall remind me of your forgiveness and sacrifice, It shall remind me of my love for you, It shall bind me to a certain man to whom I am his wife.  God, guide me now, Give me the strength to keep on, To move forward everyday of my life, To trust, love, and live the way you wanted me to, Keep my faith together before it’s gone.   love to all, remember yourself, and dont forget to wear safety goggles!  Love, Hugs, and a little weirdness, -=-a|m\e|s-=-
