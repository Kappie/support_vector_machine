     
      I have decided to try my hand at web-based publishing in order to focus my desire to engage more purposefully in gay rights activism. I intend to use this website to track the development of my ideas, record my accomplishments large and small, and maybe even to garner a like-minded audience and effect change in this serious area. The focus will be largely Australia, as that is where I live, but I am also very interested in the development of gay rights in other countries around the world.  I will therefore construct this blog in such a way as to serve four main purposes:  1)    To provide me with a 'focus space' for my own personal reflections in the area of gay rights;  2)    To plan and record my own forays into gay rights activism;  3)    To collect in one place, and therefore provide to others, a quality archive of news related to gay rights drawn from other sources; and,  4)    To provide a source of inspiration and education in the promotion of gay rights. This will also include a space for other individuals who feel passionately about gay rights but are not necessarily members of, or volunteers in, gay rights organisations.
