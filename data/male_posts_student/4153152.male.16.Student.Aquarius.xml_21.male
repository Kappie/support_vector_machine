Ghost, for those of you who don't know, is a program that compresses the data on your hard drive and saves it on to CD-Rs, DVDs, or another partition on your hard drive. Plus, restoring an images takes about 30 minutes, rather that 2-3 hours for getting a clean load going.  It's a good Sunday, don't have much on the plate and I don't plan on doing much. After reloading everything I need, I'm probably going to do a little work on the pottery wheel. Last night, I made a goblet. It's the first thing I've been able to make! It's a little lopsided, but I don't mind. It's pretty hard to do. By the time I'm a Senior (After this school year) I should be able to breeze through ceramics class. Well, I'd best get going with the reload.
