It's sublime :-)   I just wanted to let some of you know that I might be using my new SN, PegLegSpeedK1ng (Michael Hedges song. I suggest you check it out), as my main one for a while.     On Friday I went out to see  I, Robot . A the theater I saw the lady I work with, Pat. Today at work Pat asked me what I though of the movie. She said it was stupid... What the hell made it stupid??!! Was it the completely prophetic storyline, where Artificial Intelligence comes  alive  but humans wont accept it as  life? Was it the unadulterated originality of the film, where any and every cliche that could be expected in a film on that subject was pushed out of the way early on to allow for a better movie? Stupid as in: It engaged the audience in deep moral and existential thought and tried to expand, or at the very least challenge, the viewers thoughts on what life really is, all while showing us our own closed-mindedness and exposing out absurdly doubtful nature? Oh, stupid as in: I didn't like it so I went home to watch  Mona Lisa Smile . Gotcha ;-)
