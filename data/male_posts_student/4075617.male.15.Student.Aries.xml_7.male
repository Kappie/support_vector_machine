I'm about to get it, and when I do, I'm going to wait until one am, and turn off all the lights and close the shades and play. So I can freak out more than I should when a monster jumps out at me. yay! Another awesome game, Urban Terror, a mod for quake 3. It's like, quake 3, but counterstrikeorized. Awesome. I suck at it, I get about 1 kill for every 10 deaths. Wohoo.      Today my homie Chaos, in my Battlefield Vietnam clan, told me a story about pants on the roof. He said they were old and stinky, and had holes in them, so he threw them on the roof. And the neighbors were like, what is that guy doing. Yes, Chaos tells the best stories. He also sings a lot..which I can't say I always enjoy. He's ten years old. So pretty much, he's like a drunk ten year old.      Tommorow my friend Eric comes back from his mission. Ya know, church stuff. Two years without tv, radio, computers, or anything like that. Crazy. It'll be awesome to see him again, he's the guy who got me into computers in the first place. I was always at his house playin warcraft 2 and duke nukem 3d until I begged my parents enough to buy a computer. Now I'm bloggorcizing (writing in a blog, duh.)and making websites, and lots of other things that are mostly useless, but fun. :)      I should throw my pants on the roof when they get old.      ~Fin~
