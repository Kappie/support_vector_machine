Like I told you earlier my e-mail is at my brother's store so I probably will only be able to write you on my days off from work, but hey even if it's only two days a week it's worth it right! I'm precious and you know it. Well see ya later !  Rozzie   Maybe I'm just reading too into it, but I hope not!!!!!
