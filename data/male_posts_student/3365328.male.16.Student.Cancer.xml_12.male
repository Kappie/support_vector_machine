When I got there, I handed in all my books and got all the subjects ticked off until Maths, in which my teacher claimed he didn't have my book. So off home I went (No mean feat in itself - I live about 40 minutes away) just to find that I didn't have the textbook at all. I grabbed some cash to pay off/bribe somebody with and went back to school, bumping into Vicky on the way, who sympathised with me and said that all the teachers had left to do something else. When I got there I told the receptionist that I might have had the textbook in my locker before the lock on it got changed, so she summoned a random caretaker guy who took my name and made some dodgy comments about not paying for the lockers and told me to go home.   And so it stands, I can't officially sign off until they find what happened to my textbook or they demand money for something which they probably stole back themselves anyway. I can't wait for college.
