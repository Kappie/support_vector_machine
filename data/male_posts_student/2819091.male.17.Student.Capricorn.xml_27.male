       
      DAY OF SILENCE WRITING Silence,  The torture of not being able to hear one's voice. Even if it is your own, It hurts not being able to talk to the ones you love. The pain of not being able to respond, Only listen. The pain of not being able to express feelings and emotion, Just staying emotionless. The pain of being silent and emotionless, It's like feeling loneliness even though there are people around you. People that want to talk to you, People that want to share their feelings with you, People that would love to love you, Yet in this Day of Silence, You deny them of that desire they would love to share with you.
