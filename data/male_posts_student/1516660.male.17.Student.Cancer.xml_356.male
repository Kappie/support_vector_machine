I wished I've brought a book or my Discman!   Okay. Choir came! YaY! We got this really good new instructor. Her name? I forgot le. She gave us the impression that she's similar to Miss Choo. Really leh. She's just like Miss Choo! So nice and friendly! Okay. She's the Chinese version of Miss Choo. HaHa!   Yeah. She tested our voices. To see where she would put us. Hmm. I was put in tenor leh. When she heard my voice, she guessed I would be in tenor. I said Liew put me in bass. Oh weel. She tested me. I was made to sing loudly. HaHa! She said I can reach the tenor notes, and higher, but I don't dare (the last part I said it myself. HaHa). Yeah. YaY! CQ's in tenor too. After that, we waited for a whole hell of a time for Gloria. Yeah. We went back together lor.   Oh yes! I forgot to tell you that Siva finally managed to talk to Gerald Law. HaHa. After one big wild goose chase (chasing someone named Gerald Ng), I finally located Siva's classmate. HaHa! Siva's real happy, and I am glad I can make her happy! :)  Ayiah...that Gloria and CQ. Here is the hint la: Things are not what they seem. Only the observant knows. Yeah! See! You guys are lucky.   Okay. What else? Err...moving onto  TUESDAY  then.   Okay. Today, I got back two tests. Well, the other one is not exactly a test. Yesterday, I did a GP Compre test! Guess what? I passed!! WEEE! I am so happy with myself and my paraphrasing skills! YaY! Mr Jeremy said my summary was good! YaY!   The second good news was that my group's proposal was finally approved!! YaY!! Poor thing CQ though, his topic was rejected terribly. Yeah.   Today hor, during mass PE, I re-ran 2.4km. Ayioh. I ran 17.08mins, just like yesterday. I actually ran faster, because I took time off to chat and didn't run towards finishing line. Yeah. Meow meow!   HaHa! CQ is getting isomnia! You ar! Go sleep la! Not good for your body de. Heh Heh.   kay. What else to talk about? Ayioh...I dunnoe what to say le. My mind is feeling ultra-tired right now. I think I go off le la. See ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!
