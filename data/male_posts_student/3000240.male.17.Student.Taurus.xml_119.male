I had the first controversial on this blog late last night, from Erd (Jo's "boyfriend"), which I was greatly amused over. I mean firstly, who calls there child Erd, and secondly, who doesn't run to the nearest deed-poll station when they finally realize how stupid it is. Anyway, Jo from what she told me, despises this guys carcass anyway, which makes it all the more surprising that he is still so into her, you'd have thought he would have got the message by now but hey, what are you going to do, he is a guy after all, just innately stupid.  On a lighter not, the second week of the block time table has started, with me losing the third copy of the timetable, and coming in 2 hours early for everything, which isn't a great start to the week by all admission, but It's England tonight with Ian, Dan and Ali (maybe) in "the blue room" opposite the shed bar in Chelsea. I'm looking forward to it to be honest after such a dreadful weekend.  Well the weekend wasn't that bad anyway, I've been talking to this extremely attractive guy in every sense called Thomas (not Tom thank God, that name conjures bad memories of Halliford), who is friends of Pippa, who I just want to say "awww" and "hehe" like a giggling school girl, every time I think about him, as well as fuck him senseless, but I guess that goes without saying when you meet a new guy.  It's psychology for like the first time in a month at quarter past one, which should give me a good chance to catch up with Messrs, Amicia, Sarah and Suzanne etc which should be cool considering I need a long chat with them about men and Jo and how much Steve looks like a chipmunk every time we see him. LRC seems to be bursting with people, so I'll be of, I guess I'll just mull over a broad sheet, or whatever the smaller version of them are called these days. xBuBzx
