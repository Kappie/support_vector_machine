This was a nice start to my drunken evening.  I then went and played some poker and won the money I would then use to go drinking with.  Me and paul go to the Wheel just like a normal night.  I saw a bunch of girls I met at leadershape and hung out and talked to them for most the night.  During that time though I kept drinking double vodka tonics like they were going out of style.  Then jenn and Desiree showed up so I hung out with them and sexually harassed them a little bit.  Then it was closing time so I left and wandered home.  Don't really remember the walk home but I got home.  Then went in the basement and lost like 9 bucks in my drunkeness.  A big mistake.  Then I went up stairs and the anger started getting to me.  Not sure why and at least it was late and I was by myself but I really did get angry.  After seething for a little bit and drinking more.  Maybe I shot of some angry emails not sure it was hazy then I laid down and watched an episode of band of brothers.  Just another night on the town.  Starts off happy and fun and after a large amount of alcohol it ends with me pissed off watching a very touching miniseries..  very odd huh...
