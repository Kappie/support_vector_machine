I was anticipating I might not have survived because I had to give me World History presentation that I ended up finishing right before I left for school.  Talk about putting it right no the line.  Oh well.  Then had practice after school.  I'm glad that went by quick in my mind as I look back.  When practices are over, they don't seem that hard but when in the middle they always seem to be.  I'm about to go to 'walk thru' for the game tonight.  I have no idea what they plan on doing with us for an hour and 15 minutes, but probably just like a normal practice.  I'm not real excited about going to the game which is an hour and 45 minutes away without my CD player.  I don't know if I said this already but it broke a couple days ago.  Now that I think of it I think I did.  Oh well.  So I'm going to have to go the whole way without music.  Then back.  Ehhhhh.  Oh well.  Last night blew.  Was going to go to bond with Whit, but that didn't happen.  So I sat at home and did almost nothing.  I played Xbox for about 3 hours.  Jetistarfighter is pretty fun.  That's about all I did yesterday.
