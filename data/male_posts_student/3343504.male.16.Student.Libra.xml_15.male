The lyrics are so nice ... really really so nice that how you wished you were the one ...     -close to you-      Why do birds suddenly appear    Every time you are near?    Just like me, they long to be    Close to you.        Why do stars fall down from the sky    Every time you walk by?    Just like me, they long to be    Close to you.        On the day that you were born    The angels got together    And decided to create a dream come true    So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold    And starlight in your eyes of blue.        That is why all the girls in town    Follow you all around.    Just like me, they long to be    Close to you.        On the day that you were born    The angels got together    And decided to create a dream come true    So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold    And starlight in your eyes of blue.        That is why all the girls in town    Follow you all around.    Just like me, they long to be    Close to you.        Just like me (Just like me)    They long to be Close to you.        --- End ---     the lyrics is really really nice ...  how is wish that the angels decided to make a dream come ture when i was born.  sprinkle moondust in my hair and starlight in my eyes...    hmmmm how dreamy is that huh ....      different ppl are born with different fate and different destiny ..      some are good while some are bad ...      for me , mine was unfortunatly bad...      i did grumbled...      i did curse and swear at god ...      i did long for alot of things ...      i didnt like my life ...             i envy lots of ppl...      lotz and lotz of ppl...      but itz just useless , it cant help in anyway,      it just makes u feel worst upon seeing wat ppl have that u dont            after livingmy life, i found that even thoughit maybe tough ,      but when u have all your friends and you tried all your ways to find fun in your life and better prospect in life, the fate and destiny of your can be changed ....      i learned not to be envious of wat ppl have but be happy with wat i have ...            no moredid igrumbled about my life      no more did i curse and swear again      but i just wish ...             wish that everythings ok for my loved ones and ppl around me ...      happiness ...
