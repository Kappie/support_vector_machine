It is full of so many great one liner's, you know? Like, Josey Wales kills a bunch of guys and someone says, "Ain't we gonna bury those fellar's?" and Josey Wales says, "Buzzards gotta eat, same as worms." Another time Josey Wales is riding along side his old indian friend and he says, "It seems as soon as I get to likin' someone, they ain't around long." and the indian says back, "I noticed, when you get to dislikin' someone, they ain't around too long either." Another great time, this bounty hunter that's been following Josey comes in to the saloon and Josey Wales says, "You a bounty hunter?" and the man says back, "I've got to make a living somehow." and Josey replies, "Dieing ain't much of a living, boy." How great is that? I mean, it's just great. You've got to picture all of these as coming from Clint Eastwood though, in his great, rugged tone. My favorite line though, all time favorite, is when Josey Wales is riding his horse, and he pulls out to this little hut with an old indian man sitting on the porch. They talk for a bit, and the indian decides to join Josey. Josey says, "Have you got any food?" and the indian pulls this small transparent-orange rock like stone from his pocket and holds it to his eye as he says, "I got this piece of rock candy. It ain't for eatin' though, just for looking through." The most hilarious thing I've ever seen. Picture that coming out of this tiny old indian man. You have to see it. Go watch the movie. Now, I command you as the all powerful writer of the blog.....Please? Fine, you don't have to, I just won't like you anymore if you don't. I'm a go watch it now.
