If you act like you're the owner of a piece of land for a certain number of years, and you build stuff on it, and live there, and the real owner should reasonably know you're there but doesn't do anything about it, the land becomes yours.    So, with that in mind, here's a song about an elderly couple where the wife wasn't really in love with her husband, but after so many years of living together, he's taken adverse possession of her heart.  It was never true love We've been stuck here as two You may have loved me But I didn't love you  But our life was arranged This was how it should be Now a half-cent'ry later You adversely possess me  You've taken my heart And given your own We're always together Our bond is well-known  It's exclusive, there's not Any other with me And for all of these years With continuity  At the start, was adverse I did not love you well But you said to hang in there And time, it would tell  And in this state, the law Says possession's year 10 And at that point you sued me And then  You were declared The adverse possessor of my heart I did not love you Right from the start But you met all the elements Now your title is clear You adversely possess me In my heart, right here
