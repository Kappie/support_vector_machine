I would like to bang my head on the wall. but no, I did not. I tell myself that self torture is not merciful to myself. and a man cannot be merciful cannot be merciful to anyone. what I found out is I stopped. totally stopped. except for natural desires and the things I would not like myself do. but in some way, I know I want something that I feel I could not get from anywhere. no where. but in the same time I wasted so many resources on myself and doing nothing. not one thing. everyday I get up, no goal, don't know what to do.I went online, and it become quite often that I feel I have nothing to do there anymore. I've tried to play games, which is what I went online for most of the time. but I know that without people around me, this cannot last long. I need to find people. but I am so afraid of them. so afraid. even small kids. I really do want to talk. there's no doubt about it. but...   I feel I am still 16. did not grow up in this 8 years in US. I think I face the challenge and back down, back down, back down, and back down. Look around myself. everything is my Father and Mother. Those are their love. I can't see any greater love than from my families. I just feel a tragic in front of me is inevitalbe. I could even see the hole in front of me, but my feet just don't listen to me any more. they have their own thoughts. I should get whatwast mine back. it's gonna be the tenth year from my father's death. I miss him. I miss him so much. But I cannot bear the thouthts that I failed him. Totally.   il's been quite long time that I have to confront my deepest guilt. I just can't.   I just want to hold somebody in my arms. I cannot find comfort anywhere. I am afraid of people. I am not an idiot. I am not a genius either.   writing those are not going to help. it's just mke me feel more quilt. oh, well, it's already build like a long wall not. I don't think a build another brick will hurt that much anyway.
