Unsure of what would happen, he decided to ask me to tell her that he liked her (trysaying that 5 times fast). So I did and people got suspicious of my level of friendship w/ her. This only lasted a week. Anywho, she gave him a note saying that she did not feel the same way. Roy wanted to know why. So once again, here comes Eddie walking up to Jenny and the rumors of a relationship between the two of us. After struggling to get an answer out of her, she cracks and gives it away. As it turned out, she did not like Roy because.............. he was (dundundun)...UGLY!!! That was the most fucked up thing that I have ever heard.And I've heard some pretty fucked up stuff. I never thought my friends would judge who they liked based on how they looked.And that was even more wrong seeing as she was no prize herself and he did not care.After a few days of pain anguish ,and anger Roy wanted to at least stay friends. so on valentines day,as usual, he gave candy hearts to all his friends. He gave one to Jenny as a token of friendship, only to recieve a crude response "Roy, I do not like you. I will never like you. Stop stalking me!!!" what a bitch. He said it was just to be friends, and she gave a mean reply that was completely unneccesary. Now he is asking me if there is anyway to get her to like him. well just tell me one thing...............where is the guy in the middle supposed to go when he needs help? I know you have your problems but so do I. I'm trying to keep 2 people as friends and not become their messenger boy. I should back out of it, but they will never forgive me. I know this because I know them. And after countless attempts to explain to them both that they are idiots, but they don't get me so i guess i'll just have them sort this out themselves.....no matter what happens.
