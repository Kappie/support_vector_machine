We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.    Producer #8: Trackboyz   (Mike Williams and Joe Kent)    00000 00       Write Up  Very recently signed to  L.A. Reid’s   Def Jam Records , Trackboyz are new to the rap game but already have created a unique sound on a few popular singles. They stray away from sampling and aim for lyric-heavy, spoken-chorus club jams, self-advertising as bringing the St. Louis hip-hop sound to other parts of the world. Not billed as whole-album producers, the Trackboyz look to create overly commercial tracks that either hit big or flop on radio. Really, though, they make good on their promise, always managing to maintain that down-south rumble feel on their productions, just an artistic shade below Lil’ Jon’s all-out crunk jams. Now, as one of Reid’s favorite teams for new artists, we should be hearing many more Trackboyz efforts, which have to this point been extremely infrequent. If the duo were to craft some more hit singles before the year’s close, they could be in contention for the  Producer(s)   Grammy  just because their work so far has been so memorable. But, as newcomers in the biz, they’ll probably need a few more years to prove themselves before they find their names atop of the go-to producers list, a position that every fledgling production team ( the Neptunes  included) once found themselves in. If they continue successfully in their single-genre creationism (that party-hard Southern chant rap), they could find themselves as A-list in-field specialists, a title no group would dislike.   Career Blotches (followed by  Billboard charting )   Air Force Ones - Nelly   (#3)  Basically jump some techno bleeps, DJ scribble, and misty vocal samples, the laid-back production in Nelly’s “Air Force Ones” was more a backdrop behind the Southern rap celeb than a worthy beat that could work under any no-name prospect. It’s not exactly producer error to get lazy behind a significant star ( the Neptunes  have done it with  Jay-Z ), but at the same time it’s no inventive pinnacle to boast about. Released in 2002, the track laid out the blueprint for what would become the Trackboyz’ trademark sound; Nelly over-slurs the overly Southern chorus, some lesser emcees (like  Murphy Lee ) play supporting roles to enhance the community effect, and the backbeat rarely shifts. Yes, the production is better than the horridly childish job on “Dilemma” (that  Kelly Rowland  mishmash), but it’s still nothing that the Trackboyz will be reminiscing about when they really get going.   Career Highlights   Po’ Folks - Nappy Roots feat. Ying Yang Twins   (#21)  Back in 2002, it seemed the perfect match: Pair Southern hip-hop’s newest, rowdiest, and largest collective with a new producing duo that tends to favor St. Louis creationist values (ultimately rowdiness and chant). On top of that, salt and pepper the combo with the deepest-throated twosome since Jordan  Pip. What seemed perfect was perfect, as the Nappy Roots and Ying Yang Twins took a single from Trackboyz, the drawl-heavy “Po’ Folks.” Mixing piano chords will hard-hitting string stabs (almost like Savage Garden’s “Carry on Dancing”), the Trackboyz dropped their most rollicking effort to date, setting the stage for some raspy and ghetto-hick verses, provided by the 21st century  Goodie Mob  that is the Nappy Roots. The trademark track from  Watermelon, Chicken  Gritz , “Po’ Folks” is the sequel to  Petey Pablo’s  “North Carolina,” easily Trackboyz’ best work.   2004 Mentionable Tracks (Grammy Material)   40 Oz. - D12  (not released) We all knew that the boys of D12 could rap. But who would have thought that they could brawl? Calling in Trackboyz to do a track on their 2004 release  D12 World , they were transformed into a cluster of country bumpkins for “40 Oz.,” a dirty jam about violence and alcoholism. Over a crawling analog beat spiced with bells, plucked strings, and a kicking drum beat, D12 passes the mic and the booze, only stopping every few lines for a bar-chant chorus (“Pour your 40 out/Guzzle it!”). Sounding like nothing that  Eminem  or  Dr. Dre  are even capable of, “40 Oz.” is a rare glimpse of what D12 would have been had they been born some 4 states lower.   Tipsy - J-Kwon   (#2)  “Tipsy” should have been a #1 hit, but it had the unfortunate fate of being released right as  Usher’s  “Yeah!” dominated the charts, giving it the legs only to make a summit at #2. This track is so high-quality because almost none of the credit can go to J-Kwon, who does little beyond the wonderfully-garbled chorus. The only way, it seems, to dis the track would be to cite its minor copying of the “Grindin’” beat ( Clipse ), but hip-hop beats are recycled as much as paper (actual paper, not the rap slang for cash). That electro-funk shimmy beneath J-Kwon’s muffled enunciation is what really makes the track, instantly reminding us of  Kelis’  “Milkshake.” The production isn’t particularly elaborate, being little more than the digital bass line and the crashing percussion, but it finds catchiness in minimalism, an art that sounds easy but must be hard. Right at the start of the year, Trackboyz gave us “Tipsy” and the aforementioned “40 Oz.” At least we know where their priorities are.
