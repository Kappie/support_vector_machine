Just like Harry Carey wasn't a fan of Teresa's, I wasn't a particular fan of Charles.  Its sad that he's gone, and he certainly had an impact on music, but I don't find myself getting worked up over it.  Maybe I'm an asshole.  Actually, I'm sure of it.  But that's not the point of this post.  Ronald Reagan died earlier, which I did find very sad.  But, again, that's not the point.  My mom always tells me that famous people die in threes.  It always works that way.  And its odd because she's right.  Well, boys and girls, we have two down.  Who will be the magic number three?  I guess we'll just have to wait.
