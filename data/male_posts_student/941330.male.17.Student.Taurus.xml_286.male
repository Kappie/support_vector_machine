"hi, ryan!" he greeted me cheerily. "good to see you."  "wha...how the hell do you know my name, sir?" i stared, flabbergasted, at the man who couldn't distinguish iyad allawi from sabiha ali. (i know! isn't it hella sad that  our president , the most powerful man in the world besides dick cheney and prince, can't tell them apart? it's almost like saying muhammad ali and cassius clay are the same person. i mean, c'mon now.)  "oh, you know, just snooping around in my fbi files regarding you, using my patriot act-bequeathed powers of ultimate dictatorship +3/+3 to find out the handles your acquaintances label you with at no less than 23 different locations, and corroborating them with a minimum of 5 separate pieces of identification to deduce that yes, you watch wrestling." he then took out one of those nokia walkie-talkies: "john, did i say that right?"  "no, it's 'pittsburgh paper.'"  i was scared anyway. "OH GOD NO I SWEAR ON THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS HOLY IF YOU DON'T TELL ANYBODY I'LL MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT WMD IN IRAQ AND AL QAEDA-SADDAM LINKS TO JUSTIFY YOUR CONTINUED PRESENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST!"  "really!?!!" you've never lived if you haven't seen george walker bush jump 10 feet in the air and click his heels, especially when these heels are hanging off his genitalia. "oh boy oh boy oh boy. i can't even spell 'oile' correctly, i'm so excited. wait, i can never spell 'oile' correctly. shit."  "alright mr. president, how does this sound? 'boy claims famed terrorist saddam hussein in deep cahoots with al qaeda, president bush relieved that somebody else besides paul believes him.'"  he was understandably pleased. "WOW! thank you! that's the best headline i've ever heard since 't-mac traded to houston, editors too distraught to make anti-bush propaganda.' i'm so happy! wait a minute..."  "fine fine, i was just playing witchoo, knaamean cheeleecheezhawtdawg?" i knew those ebonics classes would save my life someday. "''boy claims famed terrorist saddam hussein in deep cahoots with al qaeda to steal oil, president bush relieved that somebody else besides paul believes him.'"  "it's 'oile,' dumbass," he said smugly. "i went to yale, you know. got a 2.0, but that's just between us. wait, OILE!! THEY STOLE OUR -- ER THE IRAQIS' -- OILE?! OH GOD! i'm sorry, dad! i failed you. i lost your oile and your saddam to that damn iraqi puppet court forever. CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME FOR NOT SUCCESSFULLY PERPETUATING OUR CLANDESTINE SELFISH AGENDA OF IMPOSING ECONOMIC STRANGLEHOLDS ON FOREIGN NATIONS TO TEMPORARILY FULFILL THE WASTEFUL DESIRES OF THE IGNORANT AMERICAN PEOPLE, ALL UNDER THE RIDICULOUSLY MISLEADING GUISE OF TRYING TO RID THE WORLD OF TERRORISM AND NEEDLESS DEATH?"   it's strange to see grown men fall on their knees and blubber like overgrown babies, especially when they still have shoes hanging on their genitalia.
