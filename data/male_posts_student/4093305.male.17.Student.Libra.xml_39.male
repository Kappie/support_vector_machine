Essentially it says what the leftist/activist media had been saying since before the invasion of Iraq based on the whole  urlLink WMD farce . I know it's been discredited for a while, but I guess it doesn't matter too much because there's always a new excuse. First WMDs, then democracy, now it's peace and stability or some shit like that. Pretty soon it will be "sustainable extraction of natural resources for optimal profiteering" judging by how easily manipulated most people are. Maybe Bush will let slip in his campaigns for improving the economy and creating jobs that he really plans to "accelerate the jobbery of America"? Maybe he'd get away with it? Fuck no. _ _ _  Just to let you know, school started this week and I'm going to be really busy for a while, especially when swimming starts up. This means around 2-4 updates a week from me as opposed to at least one a day like before. Sorry about that. However, I've added my good friend Athar to the team, which should make things pretty interesting. He'll be posting every now and then. If you really want to post some, just talk to me about it and I'll consider adding you to the team. We can't be much of a circle of solidarity with just one or two people. Word.
