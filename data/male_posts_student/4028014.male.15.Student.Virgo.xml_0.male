Really don't know how to express my gratitude to you!!! Oh man... Feel so guilty... *sob sob*  Hmm... Next... Felt so silly today... Woke up at 0500 to study Chemistry mock exam and left home at 0700, thinking that lesson starts at 0800... It actually starts at 0900! When i step into the school, i realised that there were every few people in school... Only those uniform groups... I was wondering, "where are all the people???"... I continued to climb the stairs and when i reached the class room, i then realised that i've got the wrong timing! Thank goodness there were also few blur souls in my class who also came at the wrong time... Some were earlier than me... But there is one advantage: i could use this extra hour to revise my Chemistry and chat with friends...  Its seems that today is specially meant of mock tests... Throughout the whole day we were having our mock tests... The Chemistry paper was tougher than it used to be... I'm so surprised that Mrs Teo would set such a paper... Or perhaps i didn't study hard... Die... Hope nothing wrong is going to happen to that paper... Next was Mathematics mock examination... Wonder which school's prelim paper it is... I find that the paper was a bit tougher but definately able to do... However, i have forgotten some of the methods to do the sums, making me abandoning it without getting any marks which i can score! In total, I've lost around 20 marks... Plus with my careless mistakes and wrong answer, i hope i could just get a C6... Don't ask for more...  Hmm... Just now when doing the paper, out of the blue, it starts raining... and don't know why, i felt my nose blocked... Trying to breath, i started to sniff hard, but in vain and produces noises... Sorry to disturb you guys... Well, half way through the paper, i felt my fingers getting colder... Rubbing my hands together to warm it, i stared at the paper trying to sole some sums mentally... Its so difficult to do that... Hope on that day when i am taking my O's, it will be like that anymore...  After the paper, my vision went blur... It seems that i have use too much of my concentration already... Furthurmore, i was very hungry... All this can't compared to Ling Feng... Her lips and finger tip starts to turn purple!!! She sais she felt very hungry and we rush to Burger King to have our lunch... On the way there, she commented that she would not talk for the moment... When asked why, she said she would wish to be like Ms Ho, who wears pink or purple lipstick everyday... Haha... Its still funny upon thinking of it... After eating the burger, her lips turn to red again... Felt so relieve after seeing that... Phew!  Think going to write till here... Tomorow have to attend a barbeque night held by my uncle... Why of all choose Sunday??? Sigh... Who knows??? Afterall i am not one of the people who pays for it, so can't give any comments... Ok... Shall sign off here...  Quote of the day (from Harry Potter): "Course Dumbledore trusts you. He's a trusting man, isn't he? Believes in second chances. But me -- i say there are spots that don't come off, Snape. Spots that never come off, know what i mean?" -Moody                                                                                  With love                                                                                  Louis
