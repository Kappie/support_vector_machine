NAW cos they decide to i.d everyone then Downey makes plans for a piss up back at his but then he is told otherwise by his lamb and the hat-trick of disasters is complete leaving me and young Michael with a search for alcohol and better company, unfortunately Andy was studying and by the time we got back everywhere was shut and it was looking like the 4th fuck up. It eneded up no too bad though better than it woulda been if it had been up to someone else, so it was " A couple a guys, couple a beers" and Blues Brothers and a dvd about Hugo Posh and the golden dildo. bahh
