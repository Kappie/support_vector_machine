It is so sad that I cannot remember him two years ago.  That is a regreat that I have.  He was a great dog to me.  He'd lick my back for some odd reason.  He'd also walk around the house licking the floor too.  He spent much of his life sleeping in the sun spots, by the heater, and close to his friends.  When we got Gabby, he looked out for her.  He did seem jealous but wouldn't show it.  She was his eyes and ears.  When someone came to the house, Gabby'd get up and kaiser would immidiately start barking.  Gabby gave Kaiser some flack, always wanting to play and jumping on him.  Once Gabby was put down, rest her soul, Kaiser noticed that she was gone.  It was almost as if he was looking for her constantly.  He missed her, you could tell.  Kaiser would come into the computer room and roll around even until his last few days.  On June 18th, 2004, we had to put Kaiser down.  Kaiser was 14 years of age and had lived a long life for a wirehaired dachshund.  I will miss Kaiser.  Miss all the memories of him.  Closing the door when I leave for school having him watch me walk all the way out and down the front steps.  Kaiser will be gratly missed.  And this house will seem very empty with no dogs within.  Sorry for this rambling non-sense.  I had to do it for Kaiser and myself.  I love you Kaiser!  See yeah later Kais'.  :( :'(
