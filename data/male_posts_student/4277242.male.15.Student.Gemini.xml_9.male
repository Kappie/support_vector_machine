It was not written by a native Ankh-Morporkian, but by the visiting vampire Count Henrik Shline von Ãœberwald (born 1703, died 1782, also died 1784, 1788, 1791, 1802, 1804, 1807, 1808, 1821, 1830, 1861, finally staked 1872). His inspiration came from his observations that Ankh-Morpork's chief means of defence was not warfare but corruption, bribery and mercantile tactics, since most the weapons used against the city were actually made there in the first place.  The anthem is particularly noteworthy for being the only one that has a second verse officially constisting of incoherent muttering. Count von Uberwald had also made the observation that any group of people singing their country's national anthem never remembers how the second verse goes anyway, so he decided to make things easier for Ankh-Morpork.  In formal occasions, the anthem is supposed to be performed by a large soprano singer wearing a sheet and holding a torch in one hand and a fork in the other.  "When dragons belch and hippos flee My thoughts, Ankh-Morpork, are of thee Let others boast of martial dash For we have boldly fought with cash We own all your helmets, we own all your shoes We own all your generals - touch us and you'll lose. Morporkia! Morporkia! Morporkia owns the day! We can rule you whoselsale Touch us and you'll pay.  We bankrupt all invaders, we sell them souvenirs We ner ner ner ner ner, hner ner hner by the ears Er hner we ner ner ner ner ner Ner ner her ner ner ner hner the ner Er ner ner hner ner, nher hner ner ner (etc.) Ner hner ner, your gleaming swords We mortgaged to the hilt Morporkia! Morporkia! Hner ner ner ner ner ner We can rule you wholesale Credit where it's due."  The final part of the anthem is usually sung much louder than the rest of the second verse, since the singers want to show they know the words...  The anthem was actually written in 1999 by Pratchett (words) and Carl Davis (music), for the BBC Radio 3 programmme The Music Machine. It was performed by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and the soprano was Clare Rutter. It was also performed at that year's Proms by the Prommers' Orchestra and Chorus.  -- from wordiq.com
