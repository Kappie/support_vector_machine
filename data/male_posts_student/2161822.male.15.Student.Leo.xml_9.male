Why must people insist on shopping on one day. And Christmas isn't even for another month. If people were smart, then they would all think "Oh, it's Black Friday. I won't go shopping today." and soon no one will go shopping on Black Friday. Which would make it White Friday? Sounds too racist.. Anyway the Thanksgiving festivities went quite well yesterday. Considering I fell asleep, I thought it was a great day. I suggest everyone visits  urlLink Newgrounds.com . I enjoy this site. Maybe it's just me, but I've been spending alot of time watching the Flash videos and playing the retarded games there. While not staring at the black hole I call my computer screen, I've been contemplating my life. All of my life accomplishments and all the lessons I have learned. I've come to the conclusion: I have no life accomplishments worth getting a medal for and the lessons I have learned I have forgotten 5 minutes later. Which is sad considering everyone should accomplish something and get a medal. "The Pie Eating Medal" "The Best Sports Player Medal" "The Most Cynical Medal" Maybe I can campaign and run for "The I Don't Do Much Of Anything Medal."  Listen to H.I.M.
