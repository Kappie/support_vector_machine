The nice guy cares about winning but he wants the other people to be happy also.  So he lets everyone go in front of him…except the last guy.  Why not the last guy?  Easy, because the nice guy doesn’t want to be last.  No matter how nice a guy is he still doesn’t want to be last.  Every person has this drive in them to not be last.  Nice guys are people too.  Of course, there’s the six words that every nice guy hates: “I just want to be friends.”  Even though the nice guy lets everybody, except the last guy, go ahead of him, it doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to win.  The nice guy always has hope that he can win, even when the leader is millimeters from winning and he is a couple steps from the start, just to not be last.  The nice guy always has hope until he hears the six dreaded words.  So if you’re a nice girl and your reading this, never, Never,  NEVER  say those words… ever.  I’ve already mentioned before that there’s always some one behind the nice guy so the actual saying should actually be: “Nice guys finish second to last.”  So remember, nice guys don’t finish last, they finish second to last.  Anyway before I go I’m going to show you the confidential, top-secret rules of being a nice guy.  Trust me, these rules definitely apply to nice guys, I know… not from experience, of course… Taken/stolen from a good friend of mine, here are the unwritten, until now, rules with a couple small changes of course:  Do  fantasize about telling her your deepest feelings towards her, prompting her to reveal similar feelings towards you, upon which the two of you will immediately engage in passionate and fulfilling lovemaking.  Do not  actually do this.   Do  listen to entirely too many sappy love songs, especially punk rock where almost every song is about a kid who can't get any loving.  Do  paste the lyrics to those songs in your AIM profile or online journal where nobody will ever read them.  Do not  actually sing these songs to her.   Do  alienate the rest of your friends when they become concerned about your depression. Pretend that your problems aren't about a girl, even though they are.    Do  drive her around everywhere when she needs to run errands even though you are really busy.  Do  let her tell you that "you're such a nice guy."  Do not  wash your car after she sits in it.    Do  spend all your free time helping her with her math and physics classes.  Do  learn the material, even if you aren't in her class, so that you can tutor her and have an excuse to be with her.  Do  have a hidden agenda.  Do  fantasize about telling her your deepest feelings towards her as you tutor her, prompting her to reveal similar feelings towards you, upon which the two of you will immediately engage in passionate and fulfilling lovemaking.  Do not  actually expect that to happen.  Do  start sweating and gibbering like an idiot anytime you're around her.    Do  listen to her tell you about a great guy she just met.   Do  listen to her complain about her trash of a boyfriend a few weeks later.  Do  listen to her tell you that she wishes he was more like you.  Do  tell her that everything will work out between her and her boyfriend.  Do  shred your intestines by swallowing a butcher knife afterwards.    Do  realize that there is a difference between a nice guy and a wuss.  Do not  realize that you are probably a wuss.    Do  attempt to forget about her. Avoid her as much as possible and never initiate conversation with her.  Do  hate it when she actually tries to talks to you, preventing you from forgetting about her.    Do  write a  horrendously  long Xanga/Blogspot entry detailing your experiences with your platonic friend. Use sarcasm in an attempt to hide your embittered feelings, but make it clear to everyone reading that you still haven't forgotten about her.  - Some loser    !Reminder!  Nice guys finish second to last.
