This site was made out of pure boredom, and the emotion that made it, will spread through it........ If you want to read something remotely interesting, go to bunnygurl.blogspot.com (the link wasn't working).....Don't ask me about it, I just heard some good things about it.  Besides, this person has original views.....Otherwise, you're here.  Welcome  "I'M AT BERKELEY!!!!!!!!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!  WHY GOD WHY?????" and God said, "I don't know why Nick, shut up and do something..."  And that's how it's going so far...  The work is hard, the hours are long, and the loneliness is overwhelming.  I have 4 more weeks of it, too.  My mind trails to the future, in North Carolina, with my brother...  I miss my other family...  And I miss my friends...  All my friends and even acquaintances have summer school or a job, but not one of them is anywhere near me.  New friends aren't quite there, but my humor has spread, so I'm not down yet...  That's all for today...  Go america..........
