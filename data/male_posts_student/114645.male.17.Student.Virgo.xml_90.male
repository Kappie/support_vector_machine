Jamison:  no, when i told you you were wrong, was you were wrong in wanting me to agree with you  Jamison:  you cant tell me that i should agree with you just because  Ben:  No, you said I was wrong because I didn't like girls, which, you think I should.   Jamison:  oh, im sorry i did say that  Ben:  I'm not saying that, but you said I was wrong for being gay   Jamison:  listen i wasnt entirely serious with that statement,.. i dont think you are wrong about not liking girls  Ben:  Well, it hurt   Jamison:  im sorry that i wasnt more careful with what i said  Jamison:  i was wrong, can you forgive me  Ben:  I don't care if you were joking around. I take my sexuality very serously. I get enough shit at school from my "Republican aviation teachers", I don't need it from so called friends   Ben:  Yes, I forgive you, but I might not if it happens again   Jamison:  ill be more careful on the subject, i promise, and i can understand how it is to have different views when the majority has the rule  Ben:  Thanks
