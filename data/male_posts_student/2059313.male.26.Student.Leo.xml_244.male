This is one of my favorite times of the year... I have a really big family, and it keeps expanding.  I love the feeling of such togetherness during this time.  It is amazing how close you can feel to people that you only see once or twice a year compared to people you may see once a week or more.  (If you're reading this, I'm more than likely not talking about you, so rest your fears if there were any)  But what this post really is all about is my wishes to all of you to have a very merry, happy, and safe holiday!  May God bless you through your encounters and keep you safe on your travels, and may you all keep in mind what Christmas is really about.  It's about a celebration of a life that was brought into this world that would one day save us all.   God bless you all, and have a Merry Christmas!
