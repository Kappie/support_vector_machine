Now that I see it, with kinda of a cold head, Is totally true that when a relation ends, one needs to mourn it, to cry it, to be sad about it. Is so much part of the healing process... too bad if you are like me and are still in LOVE...   One of the elements that masked all my pain was that I was really busy with class and family... now that I'm on vacations (which BTW are one day to be over) and saw the cause of my sorrow... I just broke...   It was a hell of a moment. This person looked really good, not much of a change though. But felt more confident, really grown up. I fell again! How can you not? The sense of selfsufficient this person projected, but all around sweet and in need of someone... do you know what I mean? ....
