Got some friends who were in Ireland with me coming down to visit. The one kid, his dad owns WGN, which for those of you who don't know is a television network here in the US. Big sports market...this kid is loaded. Had to learn how to drive when he went to Uni 'cause his limo driver wasn't coming with him. Adam, was it an interview with UBS? For internship or full-time? My interview with PwC was actually in the UBS building in Chicago, oddly enough. All 60 stories of it, or so. Anyone have any big plans for Paddy's Day?  I suppose not everyone does it all bang up like we do. Should be an extended drunk fest right through the weekend...we're on spring break next week. Adam, I'll be thinking of you on Friday. Wish I was there to spend it with you. Well, off to get my siesta in to prepare for tonight. Pics on Walkie's site to follow.  Cheers, Tim
