Today I really should be doing some school work to get it out of the way, but instead I'm planning on going to look for a part time job and go and see some friends.  I've been trying to get myself a Gmail account and still struggling so if anyone has one spare that they don't want feel free to leave me a mesaage, thank you!  We've been working on ideas for the band's new video and we're thinking of going to Bristol Docks and filming a black and white video of the band members messing about around by the docks. We're hoping to do that soon, despite the fact that we need to go and record to get a decent sounding audio track to go over the top of the video! Right well I'm gonna go and try and get my job sorted!
