Special regards goes out to   Rusalki  , have a good trip and hope to meet up with you when you get back. Don’t worry about   DK  , I’ll keep an eye on him for you *grins* Keep in touch ok? Still need to learn some multimedia and design tips from you….hmmm ever though of making it a career?   To Dear little   Tess  , had a fun time catching up with you on your blog. I still remember the “old days” at  Awake  and will always remember you as that girl from that discussion program where Li-Wen was the host. Come to think of it, I think Rusalki and DK where on that show as well. Oh well. Anyway, all the best and will see you soon. Keep that blog going yah?  Next: To   LadyRaine  , Congrads once again on being honored by your peers for your achievements. Make no mistake, I am really happy for you and that you have found a group that you like and accept you. Sorry if I have not made this clear as of late. Hope to hear from you soon. Oh…one last thing, be patient. I foresee a surprise this weekend.  To   AmberLight  , Hey you! I made another reference to you again on my blog. You better show up here more often and leave a comment or something! Heh.  And Lastly to the missing people: To   Abby  , Have not heard from you in a long while. Wondering if my mails got through. Would really like to know how you are doing over here. Remember what I said, keep in touch.  To the   Ebb Tide  , I just happened to read our ICQ history and it reminded me of all the fun times we had just chatting openly and honesty. Wishing that at the very least I could hear from you more often. I miss you old friend.  >
