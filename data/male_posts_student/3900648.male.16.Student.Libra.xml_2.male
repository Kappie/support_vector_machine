Today my sailing class piled onto four lasers, one flying junior--a two-sailed, 14 foot sailboat used in collegiate racing--, and two motor boats, and headed out to the beach. There we pulled our boats up onto the shore, and ate pizza. Yum. We spent some time sailing around on the ocean near the beach, and I stood up on the stern of a laser and guided the two kids who were with me in chasing after the fj.    After some of that, everybody came back in and the kids played around in the water and sand. I read a book, The Green Hills of Earth by Robert Heinlein. I've read it before, but its a nice collection of short stories. After a few pages of that it was time to go. I got into the fj again, and we headed back.    While the fj is commonly used in racing, and has two sails--a main and a jib--it is generally beaten by a laser for speed. But that didn't stop us from trying to pass a laser.   The best way to pass a boat is on the windward side, stealing their wind. This is where my new term came from--its sort of like you're putting the other boat in a wind shadow. I went through quite a few of those in my sabot yesterday, and its a pretty annoying thing. Not only do you slow down quite a bit, but the wind that was previously leaning your boat opposite from the way you were leaning but is no longer there.     And so that is how our fj passed up half of the lasers. By rocking our boat to gain speed, and to move our sails windward of the lasers' sails, we got back pretty quick. This is a pretty boring post I know, but oh well. Posting is good.
