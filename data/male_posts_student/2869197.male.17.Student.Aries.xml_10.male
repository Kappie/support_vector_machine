I've heard through the grape vine that our pastor-hopeful will be a newb. For the uniformed among my crowd of adoring fans (cue grasshoppers), my church is currently sans head pastor. We have Ron, and he rocks, but I still like idea of a young pastor. We need some new blood in our little crypt pitstop of a church.  Tried to drop off an application to the Alma Youth Mix 04 but no one was at the First Presbyterian Church at 12:30ish. Understandable but unsatisfying. I will go to this "Mix" come hell, high water, or ninja monkeys. Blast those ninja monkeys! Why must they hunt me?! My mum is still questioning whether she will let me go, but I will win her over to the dark...I mean...light...side. This Mix sounds like a lot of fun, and I'm always up for a theological escapade (Bless you, Thesaurus. You have taught me well).
