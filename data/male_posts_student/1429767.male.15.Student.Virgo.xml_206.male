Contact your senators ASAP! If you really are against the amendment then call your senator today and let them know how you feel, let your voice be heard! If there was ever a time to act on your political views it is now, don't sit there and let other people call for you, it wont work, this is too important to be lazy. Call them now! We can't let our government discriminate against millions of gays and lesbians nationwide. It is time to take action against it, our country isn't and hopefully will never be about discrimination against millions of citizens just because they have different sexual preferences. There is no reason that gays shouldn't be allowed to marry, you can't use religion to base your argument, remember separation of church and state? The state isn't supposed to cater to any one religion nor pass any laws in their favor nor against them, so this amendment if based on the religious ideaology that it is wrong would be wrong itself.  So I URGE you to sign  urlLink this petition  to help in the fight, if you cannot call your senator at least sign the petition... Let's show Bush what he stirred up! Oh yeah, I got this email from PFAW...  Here and Now We Make Our Stand Against the So-Called "Federal Marriage Amendment"     The moment has arrived. Republican Senate leaders are going to try to force a vote on their discriminatory, anti-family constitutional amendment as early as this Wednesday, July 14th.  The numbers tell the story.   1 President: Trying to score political points. 1,000,000's of Americans: Targeted for discrimination. 1,000 or more rights: Forever denied to these Americans. 67 senators: Needed to pass the amendment. 2 phone calls: What you can do right now. (202) 224-6221: Sen. Levin's phone number. (202) 224-4822: Sen. Stabenow's phone number.   From the beginning of the Save Our Constitution campaign in February, our message hasn't changed and our conviction hasn't wavered. Discrimination - against gay and lesbian couples, against any individual or group of people - does not belong in our Constitution. Please send that message to your senators at least once more with a phone call to each today.  Let us know that your senators heard from you with a quick call report:  http://www.pfaw.org/go/callreport/  It's not too late to urge your friends and family to speak out, so please forward this alert to them. If they live in your state, tell them to call the senators above. If they don't, point them to our web site where they can find phone numbers for their senators and all our campaign materials.  http://www.pfaw.org/go/Senate_call_list  Until now, despite the amazing work across the progressive community, Radical Right activists have been out-calling and out-writing us on the grassroots level. We need to make our voices heard. Senate leaders are taking the extraordinary step of bringing the amendment directly to the floor without waiting for a vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee. This desperate maneuvering is further proof that these truths - stated loudly and repeated often - are our best, most effective weapon:  There is no "moderate" way to write discrimination into the Constitution.   There is no "respectful" way to amend the Constitution to permanently assign one group of Americans to second-class citizenship.   There is no "compassionate" way to deny the children of gay parents the stability and legal protections that can only be offered by marriage.  As circumstances dictate, we may send you urgent action updates over the coming days. But please don't wait to call your senators. There won't be any time-outs, second chances or do-overs. Stop this discriminatory amendment in the Senate.  Thank you for all your hard work! It's truly invaluable and makes a huge difference.   Notice the bolding? Read it and weep...
