A lot of tests and homework lately.. weekdays are really the same thing for me.. shower, food, class, gym, study, food, homework, sleep...  Friday night me, kev, and zach went to Jerald's house for a party because he would be going to the military the next day. All the beer you can drink for $2.. we were hanging out on the porch and harassing people who walked by.. "You're wearing a white t-shirt with blue jeans and you are walking down the street." Then a police car pulled a car over right in front of us and we walked inside.. The girls from St. Rose (St. Hoez!) came up and we chilled for a bit.. christine is probably reading this to jaclyn.. then there was a fight outside and then the cops raided some guys house... three incidents in two hours on one street.. the police were very busy friday night! we got a ride home from one of zach's friends and to the right of me sat a 37-43 year old man... he doesn't give his real age.. his name was pete.. i don't think he ever grew up.. he's still partying with college kids! we headed back up to club 21 for a bit but it was dry..  Saturday night Reza and Darin got hurr at about 8.. we ate out at Friendly's (no pun intended).. got some beer and taco bell.. and headed up to club 21.. highlights of the night: smoking the bong, 16 people game of flip cup,  me darin and erek losing 6 out of 7 games of beer pong to katie and ericka .. i complained about their cups being loose (pun intended).. i was being such an asshole that night i cracked a couple crude sexual jokes, but i was drunk... sorry... really drunk.. we went back to the room at about 3 in the morning... ate food uncontrollably and passed out.  Sunday we ate breakfast at the dining hall, then i showed darin and reza around the campus, took them down to the tunnels and a dark lecture hall.. then we drove downtown in the k wagon and saw a lot of milfs. empire plaza is a beautiful place. darin and reza had to go at about 3 we peaced out and then i studied all day and night.. i just took my physical geography exam and i really hope i get a B. i have a take home quiz due wednesday and i have a sociology of gender exam on fucking friday! this week is going to suck. i think we're getting beer tonight.. i plan on getting drunk thursday night.. and every night there after!  SPRING BREAK!   :-P  Have a smutty day !  - R w L super SMUT
