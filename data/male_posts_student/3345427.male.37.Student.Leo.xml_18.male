Afterwards we sat and talked for a long while. I may see him again. Who knows... but he was great.  When i left him, the night went downhill and did not start climbing again. I guess I got home at 5am. my rubber bud isn't on, so ( YOU ) can read this later i guess.  My first night alone at home, wtih no company to entertain, no meals to cook, and no misery as far as the eye can see. I am not sure what i wanna do right now, but enjoy the silence and myself. I napped earlier before going out and I had that sequence of    NIGHTMARES     again. The ones where i'm paralyzed in bed and cannot move and everything is moving really slow, a Paralysis dream. But in this nightmare, there is something or   Someone     hovering over me, and not the kind of benevolent spirit either. It freaked me out. I got up three times to check the door to make sure it was locked. That freaked me out. That sequence of dream only comes during a   NAP   session, not during a regular sleep pattern.  Doug, the bondage, bastinado boy flies in this evening for a week of international language school. We have some  "PLAY"  sessions scheduled for our evenings.              Gonna get some   BASTINADO   training in this week to augment my varied KINK library.  At least i don't have to cook or entertain him around the clock. he's staying on the Plateau.  so that's my update for Saturday / Sunday morning.  Goodnight ...  i love you Jon.
