Dustin Hoffman is my favorite actor, he has awesome controll, and an ability to create a character.  i spent a couple of minutes in a miror to perfect my character, not nearly long enough. the tutors on the course im going into seem really nice, they seem like they'll be able to help me alot. packing up stuff today ready to move, getting nostalgic.  im suppose to be getting an a in drama , its something i really want to do, i love to act. creating someone different is soothing, breaks me away form the world for a little.  i think that i have a shot at making something of myself with acting. lets hope.
