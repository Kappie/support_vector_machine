Ya know when people (mostly unitarians?) have something sort-of-lucky happen to them, and they say "Oh! There is a god!"  Oh, there's a god simply because you have a dollar in your purse to buy cookies, eh? Fuck you! I don't respect your opinion anymore!  So n3ways, my dad got Halo for PC, and he was all like "Yous cant play it, because ifs we bof play on the internet, they'll catch us!" and I'm all "You don't play on the internet you toof decayed walrus!" and he's like "Oh yeah" and gave me the CD.  I didnt' actually call him a toof decayed walrus. And we don't really talk like that. But it's shizzle to be in the bling bling nizzle. I think. So, now I officially have Halo PC. I want Max Payne 2.  Worms are good at driving rocketships. Good at eating bags of potato chips, make good dreamers... like for littleredvegebatleshortening, and creamer, for coffee, and for dreams... i'm a worm.
