Just wanted to let you guys know that I love to hear about what is going on in your life's and I can tell you that it is a great way to survive a boring class with the help of wireless network and a laptop!  Because of the semester in Barcelona I have to take three extremely boring classes this semester and one that is ok.  It is about "Iceland and the EU" and almost only interesting because we are going on a trip to Brussels to take a look at the "headquarters" of EU. It will  be great to get to the continent again and if anyone reading this happens to be anywhere close to Brussels the 24th-29th of February, please let me know.  I am really busy these days, not only did school start of way too fast but things are getting really interesting with "my" musical.  I had a meeting today with a marketing company (the coolest and youngest one on the market : ) and they were really positive and want me to meet them again.   The premiere has been set for the 24th of October and will hopefully be shown until January, so if anybody wants to visit during that time, be sure to reserve two hours of your schedule to see it!  Well, that's about it for now.........
