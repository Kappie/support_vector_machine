I went on what turned out to be a 22.5 mile bike ride with Luke, I took him round where I went a few weeks back- castle eden, Horden Colliery, Blackhall Colliery, and home. But we took a wrong turn in the dene, ended up on a bridge over the A19 and had to go in a big circle to get back where we needed to be to get to Horden.  Who knows what Elliots done. I told Kat this morning about it all, she sed she wanted to join in and do exactly what I'm doing. But she has some stoner parties coming up, so there goes that. And she dosen't eat right at all, so there goes that too. To eat healthily you have to eat EVERY DAY Kat! Oh, and she was off to the Headland carnival today with faye n laura, so there goes the no tabs thing. She has just brought 200 back from Lanzarote. I bet she had candy floss. And something fried in lard. And a toffee apple. Mmmmm toffee apple :-D  Well, today is the day of the b3ta newsletter. Go to b3ta.com and sign up. It's mint. Heres a few things it drew my attention to:  Spoof government site   The actual government site   The greatest ever PC gadget- but oh no- I'm healthy!
