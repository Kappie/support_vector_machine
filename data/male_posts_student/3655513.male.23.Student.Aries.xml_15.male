This is a congregation made up of many different elements that worships together weekly in a downtown facility here in Calgary. This is not something new to me. I attend worship services regularily at my own church (Bow Valley Alliance) and as a matter of fact since engaging in my Theology degree, I could even make justification for a statement saying that I am even over-churched. I have been to countless different services in different traditions, and being brought up in an evangelical Christian subculture, have had even more exposure to various "christian" atmospheres growing up. Yet I found this morning unique for two reasons.  The first was the socio-cultural makeup of the congregation. It was a mix of church-goers who were most likely very comfortable with traditional United services which are usually ecumenical in nature (which means it feel liks a "high church" with scripted readings, creedal recitations, corporate prayer, etc.) along with people who inhabit this particular area of downtown Calgary. Now this particular area of downtown Calgary is inhabited mostly by the homeless, and various types of social miscreants (drug dealers, prostitutes, and ladies and gentlemen who openly and actively engage in the homosexual sub-culture here in the city). What this cultural mixing displayed to me led to the second unique thing I saw: A true demonstration of love.  Pastor Rick Gay (insert joke about the last name here) observed to me this morning that in comparison to the service we attended last night at Bow Valley there were similarities and differences. The similarity was primarily that the spirit of God was present and moving at both services. The difference would be in the way people expressed themselves and that was most amply demonstrated by the loving attitude prevelant in the unique cultural mixing. It is out of the every day norm to see an older united church lady sitting next to a prostitute or a transsexual. It is even more out of the every day norm to watch them share coffee and hug each other after a church service.  I can't say that this experience is a shocker for me, or is something I've missed out on having done some previous work with inner city ministries and outreach to homeless and other socio-cultural groups, but it sure was refreshing to see love poured out like that. I walked away thinking how good it would probably be for the common, average middle-class attendees of my church to go down and visit Central United for a Sunday morning service. I wonder if they would simply walk away thinking, or if they would walk away moved to demonstrate love in a different or new manner. I also walked away thinking the same thoughts as applied to myself. For me, this morning, downtown was definately where it was at....  Rooster
