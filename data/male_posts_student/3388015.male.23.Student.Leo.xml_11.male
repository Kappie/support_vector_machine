We went to the Irondequoit Bureau of Tourism looking for suggestions to absorb the culture and rapidly we were on our way to the Walmart. I went to McDonald's and took my food to the Taco Bell next door where Luke was eating burritos for the sixteenth day in a row. It's the American Way.  A gardener I am not. I don't know if I killed Benny's cilantro plant, but I certainly had no idea how to save it. My new hobby - aside from praying for miracles and sleeping on bare mattresses - will now be cultivating my baby chili pepper and basil plants. This summer I will try to keep my touch of death away from plants, and keep it safely to thoughts of babies and my dreams of happiness.   Me : Magic 8 Ball, will I see Luke again tomorrow?  Magic 8 Ball : Outcome Certain. Luke is the only one around who tolerates your sh*t. The man should be cannonized.
