Then I spent the rest of the day just around her house.  I got home at midnight.  It was an awesome night out though, it was warm and pretty bright.  Then, I spent today doing nothing.  I have got finals all next week, but it is only three days, and two of them are basically half days, which is aweesome.  So, I have three days of hell left, then I am out of there and a senior.  Camp starts in two weeks, and that is awesome.  I can't wait.  Well, this will be my last post until next year.  See you all at camp in two weeks.  I'm out of here.
