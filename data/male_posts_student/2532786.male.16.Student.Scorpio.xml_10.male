Below are the (slightly) changed lyrics:  Today I'm gonna stay till tommorow If only it lasted one day Tonight I'm gonna stay till I fall asleep Till the voices in side of me say  Just forget all these things that you think that you have in your life Just forget all the memories. Forget everything that she said Forget yesterday  Today i heard you say that your sorry But tomorrow you'll change your mind You say that you will stop playin games with my heart I'm sorry if i find that hard to believe  Just forget all these things that you think that you have in your life Just forget all the memories. Forget everything that she said Forget yesterday  I heard the phone ring at midnight You said that your on your way You try to say you didn't mean what you said Though I cannot believe what you say  Just forget all these things that you think that you have in your life Just forget all the memories. Forget everything that she said Forget yesterday  Tonight I'm gonna stay till tommorow (I'll me to forget yesterday) If only it lasted one day (Forget yesterday) Today I'm gonna stay till I fall asleep (Till I fall asleep) Till the voices in side of me say  Forget yesterday Forget yesterday
