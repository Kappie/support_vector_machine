There's 5 episodes left that I truly like, and you guys are gonna hear about them before I get going with more of my Spiderman 2 game.  So, here are the top 5 Family Guy episodes:  5. The Son Also Draws This one is where the family decides to take a trip to New York, but ends up stopping at an Indian Casino, on the way.  Lois, who turns out to be a huge gambler, goes so far over that she ends up giving up the car.  Now what do they do?  4. Holy Crap Peter's father, who is highly religious, comes to visit, and Peter is not happy with this.  His father always used to think that he was not a good soon because he wasn't very religious.  However, after taking over his job at the toy company, and eventually becoming the boss, Peter and his father have one of those father/son moments, and his father tells him he is a good son.  3. Running Mates When the position for school superintendent comes, Lois decides to run, and Peter's old favorite teacher is fired.  So, Peter decides to run against Lois, who thinks the teacher deserved to be fired.  When Peter wins the election, he is caught giving porn magazines to Chris to look at during school, and now the job is open again.  2. To Live or Die in Dixie The Griffin family is placed in the witness protection program, and must move to a little hick town.  After discovering life is different there, they adapt to it, and Chris finds a friend.  But when this guy actually kisses Chris, Chris begins to wonder if he's gay or something.  But then, this guy actually turns out to be a girl.  Wow.  What a shocker.  1. When You Wish Upon a Weinstein Peter is having a financial crisis, so he decides he needs to find a Jew to help him out.  So, after he sings his inspriational song, I Need A Jew, he searches for one.  Then, he wants Chris to become a Jew, so he sends him to have a bar mitzvah, so that he, too, can become successful in life.  There ya go.  Tonight, I don't know what I'm going to post.  But until then, go drown yourself in television glory.
