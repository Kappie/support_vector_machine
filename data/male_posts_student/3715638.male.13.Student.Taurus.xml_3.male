Kayla is the funniest person at my basketball camp. At lunch the other day, she was all "What now bitch, what now?". Everyone was cracking up from it. And then, she thought she could whip my ass in bball, but, we tied, somehow. But, she is soo funny. My team was yelling at her to get the hell off our side and she was all like "Fuck you, fuck you!". Kayla, your awsume!!
