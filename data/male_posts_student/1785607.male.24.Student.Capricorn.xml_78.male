I still cringe when going to el Centro. As I pass places we shared and moments, that still are in my head come running fast; I get sad. Sad at the thought I did not see him on the street. Jolt at the sight of him, or someone that looks like. I keep going, not alone 'cause I know I'm too weak, just to feel the rush of seeing him. I remember one friday in December, as I was with my friend Rebeca, and we were going to the movies, happy as a clam. I came to a stop sign and turning my head to the car stopping on the opposite direction I saw him. Him in his car with his boyfriend. That sudden sense of joy and sour moment of lost, both wrap in an emotion I still can not name, is the proof I'm still breathing, that I love him.   I've never been too akin on talking of someone that makes me feel sad, not even when at the beginning of this Blog I saw Neil again. This late days have been the hardest, and I don't know why he keeps popping up on my head. Was it too intense for the time it lasted that it burned me so hard? I don't know. I just wish I could held him again. Now, I am not ashamed to say that I still love him, love him so hard that I could cry, won't, but could.   Linda, who's been in the same position as me, tells me she endure two years of pain, she stills feel sad at moments. So, at least I'm not alone on the way I love. Maybe I just need to get laid. LOL! Some times I get really scared of the way I feel, I have thought I might be bipolar... well, that's a way of blaming the feeling to something other than myself. Damn! I just want to kiss the bloke!      I'm with everyone and yet not  Got to get away from here  I miss the one that I love a lot  I miss the one that I love a lot.   Swallowed. Bush.
