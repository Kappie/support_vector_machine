If I wanted to, I could probably finish it all in about two days.  The only problem is that it's pretty boring tedious work.  I know what I'm doing, so that makes it boring.  It's just the same process of transfering content to new layouts.  I've done it a half-dozen times now.  I'm still thinking of shifting to php and forgetting the static html stuff.  I'd have to learn more php first though.  All I have down is basically how to print 'hello world'  I didn't really do much today, which is depressing.  It's Saturday and I didn't have anything to do today except the paper route and the heart walk.  Both of those were really early in the day.  That left me the rest of the day to sit on my butt.  I think I'm getting tired now.  Night.
