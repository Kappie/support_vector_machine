I carry 3 knives on me and have trained in Kali and Silat for over 15 years. Not much of a problem here, thanks. BTW, I carry 3 knives now, but I used to carry only 2. A few years ago, I was the target of a mugging attempt. The fellow ran off with one of my knives stuck in his leg. Bummer. I liked that knife.     Here's another good one:   [...metal laptop case. If worse comes to worse, you can swing the thing at a mugger's head] "The dummy brought a briefcase to a knife fight. Lucky me, it was metal and the blood was easy to wipe off."    That's not half-bad. I think I might do that when I'm in uni, plus metal cases look neat.     I'd run the heck the in the opposite direction yelling for help, that should frighten 90% of your average criminals enough to flee. If they have a gun, being a moving, more-distant target will make their chances of actually hitting you drop significantly. Just look at the statistics of *trained* police officers shooting; how do you think a thug with no firearms training is going to hit you from 100+ feet away?    I guess that one would work well. Especially if you're in a public place. If you're assaulting someone and your victim runs and shouts "SOMEONE WITH A GUN! HELP ME!!! THAT MAN HAS A GUN!" it's likely he'll run away. That, or you'll get shot. :/ But assuming it's just a knife, you might be able to get away. Also bare in mind not all muggers are necessarily sportsmen, so if you can run well, you may as well be able to get away. Plus... come on, if you're a mugger and your victim runs away, why even fucking bother going after him/her? There's so many others you could mug rather than waste time running after that one victim, right?   So basically to prevent getting mugged, just look scary, change your iPod earphones to ugly black ones, have your stuff in your pockets, wear average clothes and carry a metal laptop case, not a leather one. It doubles as a weapon, remember.   Hey, I just remembered... what about those crazy tazer guns that shoot clips at the victim and electrocute the person to an excruciatingly painful experience. I imagine one could hide one device like that in your coat, and like press a button and it shoots the clips, and then it shoots a pepper-spray missile that explodes on impact, leaving a cloud of pepper stuff, making the guy blind for some hours. That's not a very bad idea. *patents it*   Hmmm... acting crazy might work too; like when the mugger tells you to give him your wallet, start talking to an imaginary person in your ear or on your shoulder, or behind you, and then have a tick in the eye or shoulder and say that you're schizophrenic. I can imagine the mugger going "What the FUCK!?" and running away. I think the best tactic would probably be to act normal at first, but then start with a tick on your eye or shoulder (or both), then change personality completely and act like you're out of your mind. (Think Gollum when he's mad.) Then you go back to being calm and normal seconds later, and you apologize for being a schizophrenic. THEN right before you reach your pocket, you change personality back to the crazy person and start laughing for no reason with a tick in the eye and shoulder. Again, think like Gollum. The mugger would run the fuck away from you.  Another approach could be to have some fake blood capsule somewhere, then do like you just cut your hand intentionally, and tell the guy you have some serious AIDS problems. [ Careful, as this would only work if the mugger doesn't have AIDS himself. Let's hope he doesn't, shall we? ] Then you lie to him how AIDS is contagious and how one drop could give him it. (You must appear confident when lying.) Tell him that one drop on his skin, mouth, hands, or any cuts could infect him. Then menace him with your hand, or explain him that if you get stabbed, his knife will get all bloody with your infectious blood. Then start shaking your hand claiming it stings, and therefore spilling drops into the air and hopefully onto the mugger's body somewhere.  And what if you happen to have a fair amount of saliva in your mouth at the time you're being mugged? Sneeze violently in his face. He will squinch or close his eyes, and that'll give you the split-second you need to make your escape. [I don't suggest this when the man is wielding a gun.]  How about wielding a hyper-realistic fake gun? Preferably one of those which have those little explosive thingies that make fairly realistic gun explosions, while not shooting any actual bullets. All you gotta do is take it out quick, aim at the guy and frown with a menacing look, then quickly aim to the air and do two or three shots, and aim at the mugger that menaced you with the knife and say "Get the fuck out of my face!" -- boy, will he run! On the plus side, you also don't need a license to carry a toy gun. Why would you want a real gun anyway? You're not gonna shoot anyone. That not only sucks, but will give you serious legal trouble if you DID shoot someone, even the mugger; so do it my way and have a toy gun instead. I don't think the mugger's gonna try to accuse you of anything after he runs for his life thinking you're shooting with a real gun.  You could also consider wearing metal plates in your chest and legs, thick enough to be knife-proof. Also don't forget that a thick coat may save you from a swish on your chest with the knife. Of course it won't save you from a stab. You might wanna wear gloves to try to protect your hands too.  Another thing that might work out is if you had some really strong metal fence-like material, but with tiny spaces, you know, kinda like the # sign looks like. I'm sure those don't weigh much and can be pretty damn strong. You could hide some underneath your coat or jacket, so if they stab you in the chest, the knife won't get to you. But hey, if you get stabbed, DO act like you go stabbed and scream like you were in pain. Perhaps even fall to the floor. Then when mugger tries to get your stuff while you are in pain, you grab his wrist, get rid of his knife, and punch the fucker in the balls. Or if you're on the floor acting like you're in pain and he goes near, take a quick look and aim a good kick at his balls, then run. He won't stand a chance. You might wanna grab your cellphone and call police now that the mugger has been defeated and is trying to recover on the ground from your powerful testicular damage.  Screaming might work sometimes. I tried this tactic one time when I got bullied many, many years ago. (I was a little kid back then.) It worked like a charm. I was surrounded by three bullies against a fence in the playground area, and I suddenly had a flashback of those scenes in Home Alone 1 and 2 where the kid shouts with a loud high-pitched scream, and the bad guys had to cover their ears due to the awful sound. It really worked for me. I screamed for a minute or two, but it only took three to five seconds before the guys covered their ears with both arms, and I escaped between two of them. My ears were ringing for a few minutes after that though, but I guess I'd rather have that than get punched or something, back then, at least.  You could also watch many kung-fu films and try to learn their moves. May I suggest watching The Matrix Trilogy a couple times and studying Neo's moves? (Especially after he becomes "The One".)   --------------------------------------------- By the way, I've never been mugged as of yet, but the ideas above are what I would most likely carry out if I were mugged. Hopefully I won't even get mugged, but who knows. :|
