First time since P4 that i went to toilet to do big business during lesson time.  Then during the whole day, i felt so sleepy. Miss Foo's lessons were boring. Chinese was pure boredom, keep going through chinese compre, so sianz!  PE WAS THE BEST! Didnt score, but managed to improve a bit on ball control. Finally executed a turn that most good players can do. My first try and first success. Still didnt like the cross from An Xuan, as it hit my face. i didnt know whether to head or use chest. but using the chest was a better option, still, the ball went to the wrong part of the body.  Shu Xia is sick. dunno wat illness. Fever? Flu? Watever.. get well soon. U dun come my house i cannot test the ringtones leh. My VCD burning software expired. cannot find serial no. anywhere. wat to do?   Soccer, ANYONE?
