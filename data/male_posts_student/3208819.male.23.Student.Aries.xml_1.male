Apparently, non-static member functions have a secret  this  parameter which make them incompatible with the function signature required by Win32 callbacks.  This is set right by changing the function definition from  void FooBar  to  static FooBar .  Now I need a graceful way of resolving   error C2597: illegal reference to data member 'CNetDocDlg::alldevs' in a static member function
