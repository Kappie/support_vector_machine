I suppose i can run home and stick my head in the gass ovens i have, end it all goodbye cruel world. okay, so i was craving some ham Tyler moved in friday, seems a chill cat, no problems so far. Finished half my takehome midterm last night, will do the other half tonight. Weekend was O.K. Saw longwave friday, but than fucked up and missed electric six saturday night. Chilled will the moms yesterday doing homework etc. feel ill a little, and never seem to get enough sleep. Oh well, will rest over winter break. cheers devin
