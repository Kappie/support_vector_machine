Really speaking I dont think Ramanathan's comments were bad. He simply put forth the plain truth- that the due is not in very good terms and they have joined together just for this Big Game. Is it possible for two who are at loggerheads for what ever reason u give to play and win a game in which coordination and understanding had to be maximum?. may be they will do it. i eagerly hope they do it in  urlLink Olympics . The story in TOI went to say what Boopati told Verbatim - that was like a bit more splashy and more dramatic than  urlLink The Hindu  which was more conservative and put that in a more Parliamentary way. This just goes to confirm my feeling that  urlLink TOI  is a Tabloid.
