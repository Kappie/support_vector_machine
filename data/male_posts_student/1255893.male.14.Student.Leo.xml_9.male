I really hate those shows that exaggerate the powers of things, but those things are just so fucking adorable. After the indigo league ended, thats when everything went bad. Its just like the power rangers. At first everything was going good. but then they chenged the things around just because they couldnt think of any new story lines. All of a sudden they started the orange and johto leagues that just sucked. And is anyone else sick of hearing about pikachu or what? i think they paid someone to say: pika pika.....................pikachu. and then never talked to them again I bet thats what they did. there is only one show i could tolerate that exaggerate the powers of their charachters. any who...............i'll let you people lement on how you so eagerly enjoyed wasting money on you're damn pieces of paper you cal pokemon and yu-gi-oh cards.
