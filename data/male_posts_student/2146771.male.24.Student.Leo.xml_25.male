I wanted to start this spring but it just didn't work out.  Business is just starting to pick up again.  It is so up and down all the time.  The kewl thing is that God always provides so I don't have to worry.  Sunday we did another concert with Trent.  The church we were at was built for great sound but it was making everything so loud.  Everyone had to hold back so it wasn't as good as the first concert.  They also had 45min compared to 75min last time.  It still went really well.  Again, if you want to check out his music just go to  urlLink www.trentsmithmusic.com   Ok, time for work soon, gotta go.
