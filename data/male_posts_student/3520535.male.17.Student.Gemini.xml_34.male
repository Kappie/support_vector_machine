She says that I’m a wonderful person, that I’m sweet and delicate and kind, can I believe her? I know she means it. Is my soul a beautiful thing? I don’t know. I do want to help people. But I am selfish. Right now, I would do anything to be loved. This isn’t something transient, a rebounding cry for help. I’ve always wanted that. So many people out there, who can live life so easily, and not get too attached… that’s why I am sad. Because I’m not like they are, I won’t find one who can love as easily as me. People do prefer things that are shallow, and when they want more, it’s hard to really know that is what you want. So, assuming I am a good person, I am good as she says I am, why am I as alone as this? A beautiful soul in an ugly body, or bad luck and simple teenage despair? I'll be the pessimist and lean towards the first one. You be the judge.
