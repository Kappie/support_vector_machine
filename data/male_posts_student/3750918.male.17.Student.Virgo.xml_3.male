In today's Deseret News, a poll indicates that President Bush will garner about 63 percent of Utahns' votes. But that's not enough. I don't want John F. Kerry to lose in Utah. I want him to be crushed by Utah. Humiliation is the goal. Actually, the first goal is to show the President Utah's unequalled support for him. Kerry's humiliation is just a bonus.  I see it happening like this: First, a little demonstration to generate a little publicity, with some custom signs. Then maybe a small newspaper ad or radio spot (I have no idea how much that would cost) with a short description of our purpose and an encouragement to get out and vote, whatever. Let me know what your thoughts are on that. I think a good deal of Utahns don't vote because they believe the presidential election as well as many of the state-level elections are a foregone conclusion, and they're right, but it's important to vote regardless. Ask an Iraqi if that's true.  Another item of business, it might help to consolidate the SLC chapter with the University of Utah chapter, meaning everyone on the U of U roster should transfer membership to the SLC chapter. There aren't enough members to really justify or require two different, smaller chapters. Plus, the SLC chapter has a designated leader. I'll be making the change right now. Unless someone has their heart set on being the leader of the U of U chapter. If so, speak up. Otherwise, let's unite the chapters.
