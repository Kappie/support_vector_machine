I think I won't grow it back though, I kind of like having a smooth face.  It will just take some time to get used to.  It will be interesting to see everyones reaction tomorrow at school.   There was a Monk marathon on tv today.  I kind of like that show, it's not something I could ever see myself recording, but every time I seem to channel surf my way to it, I end up sitting there and watching the whole thing.   Guess that's it for today, pretty uneventful.  I'll try to start thinking a deep thought or two to put on this thing.  :P
