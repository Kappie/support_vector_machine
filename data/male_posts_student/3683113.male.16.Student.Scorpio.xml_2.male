Tons of interviews with the press following an album that had a true David-versus-Goliath story and was a critical darling ratchets expectations to almost unbearable levels. Expectations will be high.   And it is in this context that Wilco deliver probably their most challenging album to date. Sure, 2002's  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  was full of random blips and spacy radio noise. Somehow, even in the almost droning "Radio Cures," the shining melodies got through the dense soundscape to almost every ear that listened.    A Ghost Is Born , which is in stores tomorrow, is a different story. For every sweet melody, there is a cacaphonous feedback squall. This dynamic was in full effect at their recent show at the 9:30 Club on June 9. The friendly chord changes of "Handshake Drugs," which appeared on an internet only EP in a slightly different form than it exists on the album, slowly descend into grating, ear-shattering noise. At the 9:30 show, by the end of the song, amid swirling noise, every guitar player had their guitar right next to their amplifier perpetuating the new, more organized, brain-splitting soundscape that defines this album.  There are no shortwave radio SOS calls on this album. Help only comes from the words and the music. According to a press release from Wilco, the goal of the recording process with this album was to record everything live (the least overdubs as possible). That intention comes through the speakers. There seems to be space and definition in the music this time around. In "Hell Is Chrome," a song ostensibly about temptation from the devil, the space between the spare bass notes in the beginning leaves the listener wondering whether the CD has momentarily skipped or stopped.   The openness of the album makes it possible to deal with the dense themes, both lyrical and musical - lack of identity (the birth of the ghost) and emotion through sound (see the sputtering, violent guitar solo attack on the album opener, "At Least That's What You Said").  But Wilco has never forced its listeners to deal exclusively with the dark side of music. After one of the scarier moments on the album, 12 minutes of soft feedback in "Less Than You Think," the jangling guitars and tongue-in-cheek lyrics of "The Late Greats" provide some much needed warmth.  Don't get me wrong. The album has some of the most beautiful, original melodies Wilco has ever played. This time, the band doesn't hide the melodies in density, it hides them in space. And often the space is much more jarring than any radio blip could ever be.  Wilco may be the best band in America right now, but that doesn't mean the world is going to have it easy warming up to them.
