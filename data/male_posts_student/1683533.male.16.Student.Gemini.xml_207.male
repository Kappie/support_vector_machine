They were featured in the same issue of Guitar World as  Every Time I Die  because they are attending Ozzfest as well.  I'm not gonna write the article up though cause I don't feel like it.  One of the things I love about them right now is the insane drums.  The drums all over the place with double bass madness and such, and different time signatures and stuff.  Track 9 titled  "Aries"  may possibly be the first song with low pitch screaming to be able to slow dance to.  The CD was only 10 bucks at circuit city which isnt much, i suggest it.  In other news, I got another e-mail for Metro detroit shows and...what's this?   The Queers ? August 7th?  sweet!   Queers Alvins, Detroit, MI Sat, Aug 7, 2004 07:30 PM     I have heard of Alvins, The Suicide Machines did a secret show there the day after the X-mas show, but I couldnt go to that.  I could possibly go to this, but its awhile off so we will see.   Forfirelifesake  had to pull out of their nationwide tour due to dificulties with their van and lack of money.  Bad news for them, but good news for us michiganders cause now they get to play lots of shows in their homestate of michigan :)  ta ta for now
