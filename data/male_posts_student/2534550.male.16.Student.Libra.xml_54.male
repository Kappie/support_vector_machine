I've never been apart of a hornline before and I actually have never even been apart of a hornline before and to have it be an all brass horn line was really cool. The only thing I'm really concerned about with the hornline is getting cut because the group of people there seem great and I can't wait to get to meet everyone. I don't think I'm going to get cut though I have a really good teacher (Chels haha) and I practice alot so I'm not   to   worried.   Well sorry for the short post but I got alot of homework.
