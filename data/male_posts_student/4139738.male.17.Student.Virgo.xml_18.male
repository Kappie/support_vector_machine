I recently decided to dedicate myself, for the next ninety days to helping elect Democratic Nominees John Kerry and John Edwards as President and Vice President of the United States and Eric Fingerhut as Ohio U.S. Senator. I have started this blog as an internet base for the Young Democrats Club that I plan to start with some of my friends at my school. I will be posting various articles and information pertaining to the election and the shameful and dangerous monstrosity that is the Bush administration. I will also post info on various volunteer opportunities around the Cleveland area to help register and educate voters, attend rallies or protests, etc. This may be the most important election in our lives. We all must unite, and practice our civic duty of voting to elect John Kerry to prevent another 4 years of the neo-conservative, special interest tailoring, and arrogant Bush administration.      ANY AND ALL HELP IS WELCOME!      If you wish to...     Contribute an article, some information,give suggestions or anything to this blog    Join the Bay High Young Democrats  OR     Request any help from me     CONTACT ME:     via  E-Mail: urlLink seamlessline@yahoo.com       OR post a comment on this blog.
