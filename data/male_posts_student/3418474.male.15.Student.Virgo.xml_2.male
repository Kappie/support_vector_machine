My life right now is good for the most part.  I'm trying with all of me to focus on God with everything I do.  I've made soo many mistakes in these past few weeks and it's been a real bummer cuz I've lost alot of people and also...grades:P.  I'm slowing finding the real me.  The real me is who God's created me to be not who I was trying to be.  Haha these past few weeks I've been also really fake just cuz I didn't know how to handle the pressure:s...and there again I lost alot because of it and gained a whole bunch of things I don't need.  I want to be exactly what God created me to be.  I know this is a bold statement, but I wanna just do w/e God asks and give my life to him...I was afraid to do this for soo long thinking maybe he wouldn't get me the girl I want, maybe he wouldn't get me the friends I need, maybe I'd just end up as some pastor somewhere and just not having fun and just not having very much money:P these have all been doubts of mine, but now...Me and Jesus hand and hand are gonna walks this....and if I fall he'll pick me up...If i'm tired he'll carry me...if I'm down he'll lift me up...If life feels hopeless he'll give me hope:).  God Rules!!!  regardless your situation just embrace God...Life can't get any better than when u do.  Another thing...Don't fall into Spiritual Pride. Idn who this is for...but God put this on my heart to just write this:P...haha Idn who reads these prolly not many but just don't think ur strong enough to do things that u have a weakness towards like say go to a party where there's alcohol...or do stuff with friends that aren't on fire for God...Or maybe even just u got a weakness with the opposite sex:s but just don't think ur strong enough cuz ur not.  God can be ur strength and get u through anything...but if u open up a door to your weakness then Satan can take control of your life....and once he does this you'll fall flat on your face. Alright well...Idn if u want things to be prayed for just tell me anyone who cares and reads this:)...I wanna pray for anyone who wants me to. Anyways God Bless u guys:) take care
