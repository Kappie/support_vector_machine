The book isn't too long, and isn't hard to read, but it's not a ground breaking novel either.  The subject matter I think is what has made the book so popular at first glance.  Everyone knows about the Holy Grail legend, Leonardo Da Vinci, and secret societies.  The success of the book builds upon itself, like Harry Potter, word of mouth causes a snowball effect on popularity.  But I digress, I just hope the movie is as good as the book.
