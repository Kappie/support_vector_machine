Only thing about today is that I,m extremely sore from all the moving I did yesterday with my dad. Whoever knew that a single man could accumulate so many things?! It was insane I tell you, insane! Despite the stuff, all went well and we ended up having a good time instead of a painful one. Now today I sit here typing away on a thumb-board while trying to get the attention of a potential employer. It,s truly amazing how fast and accurately I can type with the simple tips of my thumbs and a blue backlit keyboard. How beautiful! Well I better get back to the phone cuz I am the only one who can make the calls, nobody can make them for me... unless... nah... Later guys!
