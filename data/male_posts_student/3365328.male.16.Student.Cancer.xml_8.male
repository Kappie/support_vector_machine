Our play had been cut down dramatically (about half) and we found ourselves in the second half of loads of drama and dance groups. The theatre was completely packed out with parents and teachers, so us actors were relegated to the balconies, complete with no chairs. Bugger.  Our play came round eventually, and we did another good performance, except for the fact that one of my group members said a line from 5 minutes ahead in the play and everyone carried on from there, effectively losing a third of our piece... But we carried on regardless and got the audience laughing lots again, so it all worked out in the end. I got some nice compliments from people claiming to have cracked up at my acting, or cheeered up after a fortnight of bad moods, etc. I feel so loved.
