I live in a really small town in Michigan. Our high school, unlike normal schools, has grades 7th-12th in one building. And the number of kids in the building?? Only about 750, yeah I know, really small. usually in my spare time I hang out with my friends. Couple my friends are Randy, Ellery, Ronald, John, and Matt. Well anyways today was kind of a boring day. I went to my church from 1-3 p.m. There was this girl visiting there and I had no idea who she was. I had seen her before but I still didn't kno her. She in the row across from, was it on purpose?? Maybe, but i'm not sure. I tried to glance over a couple of time while during to see if maybe she was glancing back. I could of sworn that once or twice I saw her lookin back. But was she lookin at me cuz I was lookin at her?? I don't know, but i'm not too worried. After the service had ended I walked up to Randy and Ellery. I didn't have to say a word because they already knew what I was thinking. I asked them if they knew her, they said never saw her before. I really wasn't in the mood for trying to go and talk to a girl I don't know, mainly because she looked a little young and she was with her mom, and for some reasons me and parents don't get along very well. So the whole sitiuation ended with us waiting outside, she walked by and said hi to us, we said hi back, and we were left wondering where this mystery girl came from came from. Afterwards I went home and turned on the tube(sportscenter of course). That was pretty much the most exciting thing of today. Well until tomorrow or whenever I feel like posting.
