My grandparents have no computer or internet so i had to go there for my internet needs. Now i'm at my aunt's house, who thankfully has a computer and DSL(internet). so i'm happy. My dad lost his keys and swears i took them until i find them in my sisters sweatshirt. THen all he has to say is "oh". i hate my family. Well i have to go fishing with my cousins, its really not as bad as it sounds. well toodles
