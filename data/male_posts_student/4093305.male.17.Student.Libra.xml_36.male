That said, here we go...    It would be interesting to view the evidence the "leftist/activist media" had to conclude that Iraq possessed no WMD or was not seeking nuclear bomb-making materials, when even the chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq could not conclude this.     urlLink Here you go.  There are numerous arguments presented by Ritter (someone who was actually there), but the most important ones are that if they were to rebuild, it would be easily detectable, and that Iraq was destabilized, destroyed, and that the entire infrastructure would need to be rebuilt.    Iraq is a huge mess right now. Still, I hope that a stable democracy can eventually grow there. The benefits for the region and the world would be immense. I'm not holding my breath, however.    I agree; however, I am not idealistic (nor naive) enough to believe that Bush (or Kerry, or any American president) would care about actually stabilizing the region. The Muslim World needs to be reformed, definitely, but my hope is that that comes from Saudi Arabia...the Royal Family has pretty much whored out the holiest place in the Muslim World to the Corporate World.    Getting back to the subject of what will happen in Iraq, I think it's more likely that another puppet government is set up there, and the Iraqi people won't be much better off. They will just continue to be oppressed -- the only difference is that it will be because of corporate interest rather than the interests of one dictator.    My main gripe with the Iraq war is that I reject the notion of pre-emptive war. I have to quote Abraham Lincoln here:    Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation, whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so, whenever he may choose to sy he deems it necessary for such a purpose - and you allow him to make war at pleasure. . . . If, today, he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada, to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, "I see no probability of the British invading us," but he will say to you, "Be silent; I see it, if you don't." -- Abraham Lincoln, letter to William H. Herndon.
