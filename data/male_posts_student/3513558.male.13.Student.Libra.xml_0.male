FUCK SPYDY  Today is quite slack lar...  1st period, English. slack slack slack.  2nd period is Jap. I got back my result. 40/100. Screwed up. At least i got 18/20 for Kanji. ehehe  i pitched balls against the walls. Nobody dared to swing his bat because of the breaking of glass yesterday. ehehehe  Third period was Science. well, slack slack slack. Did nothing.  4th period was... uh, hold on. English conversation period. Well, Ms Frank must go for Crashed Wedding (lolz, "BUSTED"'s crash wedding) so Ms. Hamaguchi must manage the whole class including boys. Well, the boys are more quiet when girls are around. ehehe, good tactic dude.  Played baseball in the lunch break. Lunch was okie.  5th period was maths. Did a mock test and it was fuck hard about trigonometry. WTF. HELP!  6th period was Computer, wtf talk so much crap. can'T you let me touch the com?  on the bus back home, Wakao joked with me about his girlfriend. Hiromi eavesdropped, but failed. eheheh, pestered but i refused. I CAN'T BELIEVE WAKAO LIKES HIROMI! well, she's chio and her bro is a baseball pro but relac lar, got more hot chicks you know!  okie, at night we went to AEON to collect our CD player. it was beautiful, magnificent and most importantly, sleek. Bought Good Charlotte and it costs 2520 yen! That's like about 40 bucks! Dad's real crazy.  anyway, i am tired, gotta sign out nightz.  Squabbling with biqing. mentally weak  Thought of the day: Money is there for you to spend and not to bai swee.
