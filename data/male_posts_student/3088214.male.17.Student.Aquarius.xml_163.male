"Yes" I said, I'm sure you loved your dog as a kid up but I'm talking about the president." Anyway, they don't care too much about president Reagan. They get very frustrated with the government and politics. They are rather liberal and quick to criticize. Anyway I was doing some research and I agree with Joe that Reagan's administration ended up raising taxes, and while Reagan stated that he would "get government off our backs" he ended up increasing the role of the federal government.
