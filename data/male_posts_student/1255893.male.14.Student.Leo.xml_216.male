I got back at 8:30 and did some more exersize.. then I showered and washed the dishes before anyone was awake. It felt good to actually FEEL awake at 9 in the morning.   After that I went to work w/ dad for a while... he got to take some measurements while I hauled away cement refuse. afterward we ate @ wendy's, then headed off to some place where we were laying down these esigner tiles. Half the time I was kicking aluminum bottles off a makeshift tee ball pole.   Right before we got home we stopped at a gas station to get something to drink. I filled up the cup with like 3 different sodas. I asked my bro to guess what they were and the lil bitch got em all right =o   I think Ima start up tae kwon do again this summer. If anything it'll give me something to do. Woah... I stink. I need a shower =\
