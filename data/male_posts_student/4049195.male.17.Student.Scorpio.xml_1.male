Alas, it has not been done; it will be put off until the very last minute like everything else this year.  He has joined the mob, jumped onto the bandwagon. He is now a blogger. What the hell is he doing?  He is  Daxiel Kahnsworth  and requests that anyone reading this portion of faeces does not judge him too harshly on the disgusting mediocrity of this first entry. Why does he care about approval from faceless online entities? The answer will not come with time.
