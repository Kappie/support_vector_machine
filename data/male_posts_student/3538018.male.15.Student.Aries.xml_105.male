Thats about it....everyone else has been in fish camp and doing stuff with that so nobody can really hang out....and what a way to spend the only week that i am going to be home the whole month of june.  Actually, I cant really complain about spending time with meeta.  It seems like right now she is the only person that can put a smile on my face anytime, anywhere.  Im really enjoying being with her and am saddened by the fact that i am going to england the rest of the month....not sad about the trip, the trip will be AWESOME!  Its just not seeing her is what im not looking forward to but the way things are going right now, i think that we will make it through this just fine. =)  So tonight i actually felt like i was being useful to kimmy for the first time in like almost a month....i have been such an idiot this year when it comes to kimmy and our friendship.  Ive been blinded by my own foolishness and what i thought was the right and better thing to do when really, nothing can compare right now (besides my family and God) for what she has done for me.  She is truly like a sister to me and i dont know what i would do without her.  I am completly sorry Kimmy, and hope you can forgive me....  So this whole week has basically been a blur except with the moments spent with meeta.....nothin really to do now except sit around the rest of the night and do nothing...maybe go out in the backyard and look at the sky....that is always fun (seriously!)....im out....
