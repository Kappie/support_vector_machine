It is either by voice manipulation, where the student would just talk to the wall via microphone headset, and would be able to interact with the system like he is just talking to another teacher, it's just so happened that this teacher knows everything from Aardvark to Zymurgy. :) Anyways, the student is also possible to control the Perseus system using hand movements or body language. Real time action and fun are applied in this setting, Introducing topics like dancing insturctions, music, playing instruments and even synchronized swimming and driving lessons, only in the cubicle itself. So learning is full time simulated and expounded. Via the settings, the student would also be able to save and loas his progress and class card to show his standing, learnings, scores and record. This info would also be available via the Perseus database which is included in their website. There would also be several moderators in case an accident or violation happens.
