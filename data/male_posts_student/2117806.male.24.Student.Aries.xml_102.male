The other will probably have to wait until I've lost a wee bit of weight (twenty or thirty pounds or so).  I came up with what I'm going to give up for Lent--soda pop.  I'm drinking at least a one liter a day, sometimes more, and that's way too damn much.  So I had my last one tonight, and tomorrow it's quitin' cold turkey.  I give it a couple of days before the caffine headaches start.  On a brighter note, though (I did say today was a better day), I got my first fanart today.  First two, actually.  Both of them came from  urlLink Ping , and they're both of Earl the Archangel.  The  urlLink first is Earl in chibi form , which is my current desktop background.  The  urlLink second  is Earl looking more like he does in  urlLink Troubled Times , which is to say "bad ass."  Needless to say, I was very flattered that Ping wanted to draw a character I came up with, and even moreso that she decided to draw him twice.  It just really made my day, and I really like how Ping interpreted the character.  This also means that Earl is the official mascot of Dim Bulb.  I mean, not only is he in all three comics, but someone other than Adam and myself has drawn him now.  It's settled--Earl, Dim Bulb Mascot.  We'll have to see if we can work up a background for that.  Work is relatively quiet.  Admittedly, it's not even half over, but that's hardly the point, is it?  I think I'm going to try to see The Passion tomorrow night, if they have really late showings here in Norman.  I know Jess, Beth, and Dom are all really enthused about the film, and I admit a curiosity born more of an academic, intellectual nature than anything else.  I want to see if it really is as anti-semitic as some quarters claim.  I want to see what he did with it.  I guess I want to see what all the hype's about.  There's also a spiritual part of me that thinks this could be a very powerful film and well-worth watching at least once.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Velvet Underground, "Oh, Sweet Nothin'"
