He will be rewarded a ridiculous amount of money for actually killing a huge drug lord. You never know. The man might have just been sleeping and then when Dinko through the rock through the window it could have frightened him to death. 2. The cops will find a rock, scan it for fingerprints, and take Dinko to prison. Why it would happen I have no idea, but it would be fun to see him being taking away in cuffs "I didn't do it I swear! I'll I did was vandalize the car!" 3. He will remain on the streets to kill and kill and kill and since he is so elusive he will never get caught. 4. Everyone will forget about this misfortunate event. I personally want to see number 2, but most likely everyone will forget about this in a day. Anyway, if the cops want location on this insane killer, take a stroll through White Haven. And send me my reward in cash. Anyway... I think I have way too much fun at lunchtime. The people I am fortunate to sit with sometimes make me wonder, do they know they are friends? Every other two minutes they are fighting about something. "You talk about your cell phone too much!" "What else is there to do?!" "Dave I hate you." "What did I do?!" "That was the stupidest comment ever" "WTF" Yes, and there is plenty more. Sometimes I wonder about people. Good news. I finally found the college I would like to dedicate 4 years of my life to: Our Lady of the Mother of The Blind. I enjoy math class too much. End post.  Listen to H.I.M.
