There was no point in the film that was hard or painful to watch and I enjoyed every gosh dang second of it. It's weird how I like this movie so much and don't have anything to rave about but the movie itself. I guess there is no scene that is better than the previous and I could say without blinking, that every scene in this movie was magnificent. Or maybe I'm not raving because it's a love story and that automatically makes it a chick flick, just kidding.  I've thought about this a lot, and with no narcicism involved, I think I could be considered a genius in any random date B.C. Of course there are lots of people that are more intelligent and wittier than I am, I think I am the bare minimum.  I finally got my permit, started driving and that's all I'm going to say.
