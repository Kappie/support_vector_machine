I'm tired now and a bit annoyed, I will be talking to all of you guys later.  " " God " : Grace. You want her back?  Bruce: No. I want her to be happy, no matter what that means. I want her to find someone who will treat her with all the love she deserved from me. I want her to meet someone who will see her always as I do now, through Your eyes.   " God " : Now THAT'S a prayer." --Bruce Almighty (Thanks to Danny for the movie suggestion; even though he still doesn't know that he did suggest it)
