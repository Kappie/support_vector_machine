Then someone starts heffing me so in an attempt to defend myself i start hanging over the guard rail. Next thing i know someone is pushing me and the other guy is pulling me forward and my legs went up in the ceiling to the point where i thought i would end my life of doom with a nasty 8 foot fall head first into lindz tv. Luckily i was saved at the last minute by lindsay C, maybe next time i won't be so lucky. Also , when we were walking home, i noticed my friends kicking around some rotten cushion. I decided to pick it up to shoot it at someone. As i bent down i felt this raunchy mist enter my eyes and a ratty sogged pillow hit me in the face. (someone kicked it on me)  i screeched and then exclaimed IT SPRAYED ME WITH DISEASE! when my eyes were able to SEE again all i saw was my friends all in the crouching (i cant take it im gonna piss my pants ) position and laughing like hell. I just laughed it off wishing i coulda seen that from another angle in some other form or something. Also, I hate poutine.
