I have to say, her feelings toward everything that has happened with Jon and her the past few days seem awful close if not the same as my feelings towards our relationship.  I was damn furious.  I hated Jon for so long, and I knew it was coming.  Now, I think I know what is coming for her.  I wanna say she deserves it but I know that's not what I want.  I knew the relationship between her and Jon wouldnt and will not last, but I may be wrong.  I mostly think this because everytime I see him he is flirting with girls, always.  In the parking lot of Pockets, with the girl who works and Pockets and yes, even Kassandra, I saw it all three times.  Ohh well, I'll see where this goes, it may last, it may not.  AS THE WORLD TURNS, LOL.......
