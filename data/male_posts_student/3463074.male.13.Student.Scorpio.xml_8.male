Well, on to more domination plans. For those of you who don't know, go to http://hamsters4me.blogspot.com/ and read of leprechauns powers. I have already captured an intire clan and have midget informants living with them. Though they do make excellent decorations, they have othere uses also. I have found that i am able to imbue there magical powers upon peolpe by sucking the leprechauns soul out and transferring it to the person. Along with superpowerful magic though, they gain an irrational addiction to either opium or wax of any kind. And if they are unable to continue to consume at least 5 kg daily, they go into a berserker rage and turn everything around them into the desired substance. i have a problem about building fleets of them because i am often unable to supply such vast amounts of opium or wax, and thus they are constantly turning eachother into the afore mentioned substances. Along with this plan, i have aquired the giant magnet i needed, success being brought to me by an anonymous sender who i thank, whoever you may be. It has allowed me to get the space shuttle i needed and have sent my satellite into space, so know, not only do i have a very precise laser defense sateliite, i have a nuke and free cellphone service.
