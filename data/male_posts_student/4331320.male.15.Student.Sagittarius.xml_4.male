Federline, a backup dancer by trade, will star in the pop tart's new clip--a cover of Bobby Brown's "My Prerogative." The track is one of two new-ish songs to be included on Spears' greatest hits album in stores Nov. 16. (N.B., Britney: Bennifer commemorated its love in "Jenny From the Block" and look how that turned out.) Scheduled to debut in early September, the video will feature Spears dressed in a wedding gown and walking down the aisle with Federline. According to People, she'll also be seen in her undies--after cutting off the straps of her wet dress with a kitchen knife because she's driven her car into a pool. (Don't you hate when that happens.) Writing on Spears' official Website, her mom, Lynne, says the video is being shot at the historic Paramour estate in Los Angeles and will feature lots of close-ups, since the Britster's bum knee still hasn't completely healed. It will also be a family affair. As Lynne writes, "Please look for that good looking hunk of a son of mine in the video--he has a cameo right at the beginning." Mama Spears has also been helping the young lovers shop for a new house ever since they returned from a "relaxing trip" to Lake Tahoe. (Rough life. Didn't they just return from an RR retreat in Hawaii?) Meanwhile, the video isn't the only Spears-Federline coproduction on the horizon. Along with their impending real-life nuptials, reportedly slated for November, the happy couple is reportedly interested in starring in their own Newlyweds series on MTV. With Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson 's second anniversary approaching and Jessica pouting to Us Weekly that she's through living in the music network's fishbowl 24/7, the New York Post reported that Spears wants to pick up the reality series slack and make her no-name fianc famous in the process--after all, he does have two children to support. MTV has denied having any talks with Spears, however, and Joe Simpson, Jessica's dad and manager, has said the original Newlyweds couple will return for one more season of TV bliss. Or maybe Lynne and Joe can just duke it out?
