You see, all my synapses are engaged in pondering the deeper meaning of...    THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS    That's right folks, it's time for the Dice Squirrel to review the last in the "Woah..." trilogy.  Once again, on opening night (this night) I saw the Matrix. Upon getting the tickets, I did some sort of a jig. I'm not sure.  We'll start from the start, and go from there. Bear with me folks, I'm still not altogether here, most of me is still thinking furiously. I'm pretty sure the opening had something to do with the really intense I'm Out of the Matrix, and Really Intense About It people. Hovercraft, tunnels, shots of various vaguely ethnic-looking people, along with a few dyke-y females. Very strange sequence (probably because I'm still halucinating from all the strobing gunfire of the last half of the movie) , all in all, but at least it had some purpose to it, which is more than I can say about most of Reloaded.  Then there was something about trains, Indian people, and hobos. I believe there was a chase scene stuck in there somewhere. Then the old actress of the Oracle dies and they make up some really shitty plot devices to explain the not at all similar replacement black lady (though she still looks like she could advertise for Real Home Cooking Maple Syrup.)  I'm losing the really hysterical (at the time I thought of them) bits of the blog, so I'll summarize the plot very quickly: Neo walks around, looking like he's higher than a cat's back; the Council of Zion and the People of Zion act out a few scenes straight out of some Star Trek thing somewhere sometime; there's a very long (and fucking badass, I should add) fight scene between humanity and machinity.  Right, on to my making fun of several parts of the movie.  I was the only person in the sold out theater who broke out laughing when all hell was breaking loose in Zion. It's one of those things where the camera focuses on a nobody soldier, who's saying something like, "Sweet baby Jesu--" while another random soldier gets thrown across the screen, screaming. If I had a nickel for every time they used that damn scream sound bit...  Also, the movie actually uses a cliche it has created. Normally, that's not cool. Here, it's not cool. I don't know what they were thinking. Trinity does her little Jump Up Into the Air, Pause, Spin 360, Unpause, Kick the Guy In the Face thing. Again.   Also also, the machine city looks very similar to every other Evil City. Spiky towers, dark clouds, lightning, flying nasties, and a Head Honcho with a really deep, loud, resonating voice. Though the big floating Head Honcho of Revolutions is quite nifty, I must admit.  All in all, I loved the movie. It'll take a few more viewings and a few more days for me to realize the scenes I really adore, but I'm pretty sure they all have something to do with Kicking Ass.
