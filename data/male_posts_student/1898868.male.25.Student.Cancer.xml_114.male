Well, usually we talked about the Planet of the Apes series, the Sacramento Kings, potential nicknames for people on campus, and how soft Craig was.  One thing we did not talk about was books.  My roommate Maestro would always discuss literature with our friend Wheatly, though.  We called their dicussions the "Culture Club."  The Culture Club was like a fraternity,  but Kaufman was not in it.  Anyway, the Blogger seems to be transforming itself into an offshoot of the Culture Club.  There's nothing wrong with this.   But I can add little, as the only book I have read in the past few years is Moneyball.  It was decent.  I think Whitey would like it.
