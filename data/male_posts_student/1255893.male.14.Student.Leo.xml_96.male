About a week ago a friend of our family took away my computer to get a few things fixed. Namely my virus scan and umm ...... well I thought that was it. I had gotten it back the following Friday, though it came at a price. All of my files (pictures, written files, ALL OF MY DOWNLOADS!) all gone..... :( I'm still trying to get everything back. The only thing I really need now is my window washer. Which leads to my next ..... umm .... thing ... to umm ... talk about i guess. I downloaded McAfee VirusScan 6.0 pro edition. It was right on time too. About an hour after I got it I was attacked by a virus. It would've been easy to get rid of except for the fact that I couldn't find out how to get rid of it permanently. I'm guessing it's a new one but I don't give a sh*t either way as long as it dies! Ugh! Well, on to more happier stuff!   Yesterday was freshman orientation.  It was okay. I saw a few of my friends. That was kewl. Even thoguh I only got 1 hug out of the whole group. Thank ya megan ... even though I doubt you read this. Well I would've gotten my picture but the line was endless and they hadn't even opened the doors yet. I did get my locker though. Which is kewl cus it's in the same hall as johnny. YAY! :-D We got picked up by my brother's friend enza to go out to eat at del taco. Pretty kewl I'd say. After that we headed to Fry's to check out some speakers for my computer. I happy now that I finally have audio! So I guess I can get myself some Mp3's now! You wouldn't believe how happy this makes me. Since I got my computer I havn't been able to hear what it sounds like. Well after Fry's we headed to best buy to find some cd-r's. It was so awesome how we ended up buying a mouse bad for me. After our excursion there we headed off for a drive. I have no idea where we were at anytime but you know what? I didnt care at all. It was just awesome to go around and listen to a conversation. I liked just listening to my brother and enza saying random stuff. Well after that thay dropped me home and the 2 of them headed to do crap. I stayed home installing my speakers. I fell asleep. Probably the best part of the day. It's been such a long time since I've taken a daytime nap.  Now today we went out to hometown buffet. I guess my parents were feeling bad that we couldn't do anything nice for either me or my brother's birthdays. We stole like 6 snickerdoodle cookies. Those are sooooooo disgustingly good! Now were home. Now my brother's friends enza and minjung are here screaming at the TV. We're alternating between watching the food network and the desilu story, and i think some japanese soap opera. so awesome. : ) That's pretty much it for now. I'll ttyl. L8R!
