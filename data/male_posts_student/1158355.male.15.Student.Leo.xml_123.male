I'm sick of it, life's so confusing, I just wanna throw a girl onto a trampoline or something...because that's ultimate torture...right. Ya I quit girls, well no I'm not turning gay, I'm just saying they're too complicated and confusing and I can't handle it, so whatever happens happens, I'm sick of them all, they never make plans with you, they never care, they just sit around like lazy bums...mwuahahaha! Guys are awesome. Ok so some girls aren't lazy and don't LIE all the time saying their gonna dump someone for you and then never do it. Try being true to your word! hahaha holy crap so I rode all that way and I don't even get a kiss. Ok, then I had to leave because her brother was about to find out I was there so out I went through the window, oh ya nobody tell anyone or my parents I did this because my dad thought I was just "biking" so I went out the window and ran for it, dodging lassy as he bit my leg. Then on my way home I found Paul and his mom at the post office. So that was my excuse for being out so long, which contributes to the whole "I NEED A CELLPHONE DAD" issue. Yea I'm getting one soon so my parents don't always have to worry. The ride there was long, the ride back was hilariously short, for now on I'm taking the mainroads, it's so much faster...so this dude on the way there was crossing 347 while I was thank god, I would be so scared doing it on my own. Maybe it was god disguised in a mexican biker suit. Ya maybe if he wasn't there, I would have died! Yes! So, I hung out with Paul and went to Supercuts, saw Crystal at Country Kitchen, saw Mrs. Michaelis and the girls at Eckerd and on the way home, people sat on the seat while I biked...yes very gay but time benefits as well. God, it was so scary knowing that if I backed my butt just an inch, I would have been officially raped by Paul. Then Paul and I ate at my house, then went to Paul's where Paul had to go to soccer so I spent my time talking to Mrs. Stoltz, World's #1 Therapist, no really, she's awesome. It was about my whole "OCD" and "ADD" problems. Ya, I think I think it helped alot. So I'm home now, and I'm shakin' my tail leaf...or whatever it's called. My cousin just gave me news that Angelica doesn't like me and that it's a whole fuckin' lie. Who knows, you know what! I DON'T CARE! It's just to confusing to deal with so I'm just ignoring it and pretending she likes me because she's basically the hottest I can get. You heard of chick magnets right? well I'm Mr. Chick Repeller...comes with free washing detergent with your second purchase of Mr. Chick Repeller (Made by The Man Himself {Copyrighted 1923}). Oh goody my dad's home now so I'm gonna be on my way of enjoying the last night of freedom before school and uh...I'll be making cookies with Paul, isn't that fucking sweet, you gotta add the fucking, sorry I'm really hyper right now! WOOHOO! Woof Biff! Haha nobody knows what that means except Dan, Pat, Jimmy, and I. Silly sister of mine. Ok, so cooking cookies and that's it, oh I gotta drum now. Later BOOOYYYZZZZ, see ya'll in the s to the c to the h to the double o...you know what screw that, too long, cya people in school. Good luck to all Freshman on your first year in the bighouse...well smallhouse for now, next year starts bighouse. Goodluck Britt and Kate, study hard, get great grades because these are the grades that depend on where you go in the future!  Yes let's all say goodbye to this dumb Blogger V2.0 and introduce the new Blurty XL 6200...or just Blurty. But don't worry, I'll still have this site's link on my blurty page. I figured, new school year, cooler and better and newer journal hizouse. Ok bye.
