They always leave me happy and free of worry, even if I probably should be worrying. Our discussion was about Debate (capitalization is key here, people.) He thankfully gave me some good news about debate camp funding. Apparently, some wonderful ex-MS Debater is willing to help fund our measly Debate team. He wishes to focus on helping novices advance, but there is still hope for an old Varsity 'Bater such as I. We spoke of the Research-a-thon and the Debate Garage Sale, both wonderful plans to raise our much needed cash. He says that, at a bare minimum, he thinks there will be $400 dollars available for me from school, the Green family, and other sources under his persuasion and control. We shall see if that figure stays so beautifully high, but it's worth hoping for. As only makes sense, I will not be the only Debater off to the great fountains of knowledge we call Debate Camps. The other returning 'Baters are all possibly going as well. Let's see if I can remember who's coming back...Molly, Navi, Poonam, Kelly, Andrew, Emily...that's all I can think of for now.  The discussion turned to a certain debate meeting upcoming. Mr. Green has asked me to give a wittle speech about the pros/cons of debate life in general to the general debaters-to-be. We whinnow the wheat from the chaff. Following this analogy, I must provide a strong enough wind to blow away those who would hate Debate, while keeping it pleasurable enough to maintain those who would enjoy it. Following this, I shall speak of the pros of debate camp to the returners. I truly do hope at least some of them consider camp. It truly opened my eyes to the possibilities of debate and so much theory...so much.  Following  this , I spoke to him about an idea for a case I gleaned from a movie my family rented:  Beyond Borders . The plan is to provide US backing of some form to the UN High Commisioner of Refugees. This has some crazy good harm and a gleaming pile of possible Advantages. It may be worth looking into.  Following   this  , Mr. Green voiced his wish that I would become a Debate assistant while I'm in college. He spoke of the wonders of Calvin, as it is close to Muskegon, and could make this dream a reality. ARGGHHF! Calvin is looking more and more worth joining every day!
