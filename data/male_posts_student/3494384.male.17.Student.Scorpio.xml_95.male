Originally, our plan was to mugged for today's tests but don't know for what reason, we ended up playing lot of MSN games. Play and slack till quite late. 4 plus.  Basically, I've only studied IISO Chapter 1 and 20% of Chapter 3. C Maths? Haven't touch. Decide to revise it during the 4 hours breaks later.  It's so cold now. Damn cold. Bad omen to my term tests today? Ya, I know. I couldnt possibly passed today's test.
