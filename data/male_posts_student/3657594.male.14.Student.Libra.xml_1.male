Don't be fooled by the bad spelling (or possibly clever marketing) its not what it seems.  There is no Spider Man 2, its Spidermon vs Octupusmon, the digimon movie.  Well I haven't actually seen it but I heard it from a reliable source, I think.  It could have just been the water cooler making noises, but you can trust me, right?
