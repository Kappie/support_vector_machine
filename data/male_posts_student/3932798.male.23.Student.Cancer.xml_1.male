To sum it up quickly, I had two aunts and one uncle actually staying at my house and two cousins and their four very young children running around the house the rest of the time.  All and all it wasn't that bad of a weekend....just long.  The only really bad thing is what is still happening with my girlfriend/ex-girlfriend.  She and I are still talking.  It now sounds as if she wants to keep talking and hangout and even still be together.  She says that she sees that she was just being dumb.  Ok, I will give her that but this isn't the first time that this has happened.  Am I just supposed to forget everything and take her back.  It hurts being cheated on or having the person you like think that she is falling in love with another guy.  Especially when those guys are really geeky looking and ugly.  That just makes me feel like a dog ugly person.  I guess maybe I am.  I just don't know what to do with that situation.  I am scared to move on and leave her.  Speaking of being scared.  I am absolutely mortified about law school starting in a month.  I am afraid that I can't handle it or that I won't like it.  What then, I would have wasted five years of my life studying for something that I don't want to be.  I should have just become a professional golfer and worked at some golf course.  Work is alright too.  The twins (two friends of mine and the brothers of one of my dear friends) will be leaving work too this year.  I will miss those two.  Over the years working at Blimpies I have grown to love them, their sister, and my bosses.  I will miss them a lot since this will be my last summer returning to Blimpies to work.    Well, off to read just thought I drop a line to whoever might be reading my blog.
