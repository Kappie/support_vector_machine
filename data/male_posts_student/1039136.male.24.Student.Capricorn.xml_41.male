I guess it's little things like that that make you fall in love, that define you as a person and make your life what it is. Life isn't measured in how many designer outfits you have, or how much money, it's who is in your life that really matters. It's what you do with the people that matter. It's not the drunken nights out at the bar, although they make for intresting stories, it's more than that. It's about waking up next to somebody you love, not being able to envison your life without them, it's about having a real friend to call when you need to talk. Life isn't measured in how much beer you can chug, or how loud you yell at your pledges, it's about love. it really does make the world go 'round."    You may have seen that as my away sometime earlier today. I think it's a pretty damn good description of love. Most people just don't get what love is..so I used that as my away to hopefully open up some of your eyes. I got that in an email today from a friend. It wasnt one of those chain letters either, it's just an excerpt from a much longer email where someone was trying to convey to me what i've taught them.      I guess then, I hope someday you all find out what love is like. Many of you will read that above and not understand how a person can feel that way. If you're one of those people, you've never really been in love. I'll fight you on this one too if you think you've been in love and disagree with any of that.      I dont have a really long entry to post because i'm uninspired for the most part. I'm just going to finish this off with some boring 'whats going on' sort of stuff.      -Work is crazy..but i love it...look for me securing computers in a home near you..lol   -Wrestling Saturday in Hanover..not really looking forward to this being that its a LONG ass drive and I dont get to play my normal character..which sucks..i'm a Teen Icon Dammit.   -The one good thing about Saturday is that Markle will be there and i'll get to hang out with that crazy fucker. heh at least i'll get a crowd reaction this time.   -I'm getting a cell phone on friday..FINALLLLLLLLLY :)   -I cant wait to get back to school...sad its my last year though   -Thinkin bout having an end of summer party..who's in ?
