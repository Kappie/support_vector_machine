The books were bent in a awful manner and my hands which had tried to hold them ever so tightly succumbed to the stronger arms of Chung Chi, throwing me violently off my desk. He pulled it away from me and slammed the books tightly onto my shoulders with no regard for them. The books were in a dishevelled mess as he threw them onto his desk.     " YOU must learn not to resort to violence!" I screamed at him. He was unabashed and started flipping through the pages and copying the answers. I went back to my desk, incandescent with rage, fuming to the brim of explosion. Lin Zheng came forth and tried to console me but I was too mad to really listen to him. i turned back to my Social Studies Textbook and tried to concentrate on reading it but my heart was not there. I tilted up my head and stared at Chung Chi. He was furiously and mindlessly copying the work.     And then, from the corner of my ear, I heard Zi jian's squeaky voice commenting to Chung Chi, " You shouldnt have done that..."               He swore in mandarin scolding me in everything he said. Zi jian was only half his size, what could he do...    Too bad he never knew why I resisted lending him the book, he was never a Physics rep, or other reps before anyway, or maybe for what I know. He has the same mentality as every other person in the class, and Dharma even commented to me, "Eng Wei, actually your not being responsible, this is just all an act." Yea, an act to curry favour. Thats what he thinks.     Somehow, they do not realise the the two sides to it. People hand in homework, trusting that I will protect their rights in the confidentiality and safety of their books. But sadly there are still some delinquents in our class who prefers to copy homework instead of really sitting down in a corner and spending time doing it. And these people would come on their knees to the Physics rep, begging, pleading and exhorting for a book to copy from. These miserable fools would then resort to violence once their pleas are denied. So these idiots come up to me and say "stop putting on an ACT!". Easier said than done. If they bothered to sit down for a moment and consider what would happen after they took the books, they would realise that I am taking a very big risk in lending them the books to copy. Once the books that they extort from me goes missing or gets damaged, the blame would then be directed towards me. "BLAME the Physics Rep for his imprudence!" yes, they all say. "Anything happens to my book, I'll hold you responsible." another warns. Even Kukuh Dwiputra has lost his trust in me and prefers to hand it in personally to Mrs Seetho, our Physics Teacher. Thus to protect my rights and not get pushed here and there, I exercise stringent controls on the outflow of books from my hands and only loan the books to those who seek the permission and confirmation of those students who are willing to risk it all, just for the happiness of the other useless student.    And yet, Chung Chi prefers not to demote himself to begging or pleading the other students for their books. Since he wants to perform such illicit tasks, he should make the sacrifice. Violence was what he wanted, retribution will be what he gets.             Soon, when next year's March arrives, everything will be evident and he will realise his folly, and so will Daryl Yeo.
