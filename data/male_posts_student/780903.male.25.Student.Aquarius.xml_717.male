So this has a tune, trust me... it's just not a tune you've heard before.  "Interview Suit"  Interview Suit Keep you away From anything that is gonna stop me From wearing you one more day  Interview Suit I will be screwed I'm keeping you safe inside some plastic And far away from any food  There's coffee in the corner And fruit out on a tray Chocolate covered pretzels And a deli wrap buffet There is juice inside the pitcher But I'm steering very clear There will be no dirt that's landing on my suit I'm wearing here  Interview Suit Keep you away From anything that is gonna stop me From wearing you one more day  Interview Suit What do you think I'm keeping you safe inside some plastic And away from food and drink  If I bleed I will drip downwards If I sneeze it's to the floor If there's rain I will start crying And walk to the nearest door Because, suit, you were expensive And I've got no other spare Oh for three weeks you're the only thing I wear (at least on the days I have interviews)  Interview Suit Keep you away From anything that is gonna stop me From wearing you one more day  Interview Suit You're such a pain All day I'm running interference To make sure that there's no stain  Interview Suit Keep you away From anything that is gonna stop me From wearing you one more day
