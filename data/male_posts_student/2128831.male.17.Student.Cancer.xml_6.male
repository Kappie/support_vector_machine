Then the sink was clogged, not a surprise, so the little flamer, the butter knife and the sink disposal get into a little fight twenty minutes later it worked, so then back to dishes, they were all slippery and nasty, and plain gross!  I hated it.com.  So, it was not fun at all.  And, then the rangetop!  There was these black grease ring thingies, and I sat there, well I stood there with the scrubby pad and this putrid smelling cleaner, gagging on the fumes, it was like it was from a jock that hasn't showered after a decathlon.  So, Samantha's kitchen it clean now! Woot, woot!  And more to woot about I wrote more poetry, so here is that...  Thanks again to my good boo, Jared!   An Absolute Must  My heart yearns for you  across the many miles that seperate us  We know this to be true  for us, being together is an absolute must  My heart cries out to yours  across the many miles that seperate us  It is eachother that lures  for us, love and care is an absolute must   My heart burns for you bright across the many miles that seperate us  We know our own fire we light  for us, our desire is an absolute must   My heart for you belongs within  across the many miles that seperate us  A smile or even a simple grin  for us, tenderness is an absolute must   My heart for you will always be  across the many miles that seperate us  For you, for the entire world to see  for me, you are my absolute must     Take my hand  Don't be afraid, this won't hurt Have some faith, this is real Together all this feeling we can sort We together can feel  If you just believe in me  If you can ever just wish to understand If you wish to stay And, to let your own thoughts run free If you believe in me Take my hand Walk together with me Take my hand Let me guide you to a special land Take my hand Together in this world can be Take my hand Don't let it slip like grains of sand Just take my hand Don't worry at all, this is fine Have some passion, this is real Together we will never draw the line We together can feel If you just believe in me If you ever just wish to understand If you wish to stay And, to let your own thoughts run free If you believe in me Take my hand Walk together with me Take my hand Let me guide you to a special land Take my hand Together in this world we can be Take my hand Don't let it slip like grains of sand Just take my hand And believe... In you... In me...
