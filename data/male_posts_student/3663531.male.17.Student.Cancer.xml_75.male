You'd think I would have stacks of things to post, and I probably do but at the moment I can't actually remember any of them...  So, it should come to me soon...  Also, I have to get up before 7:00 am tomorrow! Shock horror! Then I get to spend 3 hours on a busload of freaks, and then walk around for a few hours, then another bus trip! Weeeeeee!
