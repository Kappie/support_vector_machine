I could watch that guy talk about tiny classified ads all night long, but I don't even open the email from Dana telling me about generic viagra.  Why can't the email at least be interesting?  A little story about a guy named Phil who couldn't get it up, and found salvation in a little blue pill.  Or an amusing anecdote from a woman who was dissatisfied with her man's manliness, and bought him enlargement pills online.  Something juicy and entertaining; something that might make me read or open those emails for the entertainment value.
