It is likely your teacher won't teach, therefore make do with smart I.T. people in your class. 3. Attempting to write a report when you do not know the necessary tasks to complete can be fatal. If (and probably when) your teacher ignores you and doesn't tell you what to do, make do by doing the same things everyone else in your class is doing. 4. When a task requires a certain amount of time, half it to receive the actual allocated time slot. 5. When your computer breaks, don't smash it. It won't start working. More likely, parts will fall off and the power supply may explode. 6. If conversation is not allowed during the task, assume taling is fine. 7. If conversation is allowed in class, assume copying is fine. 8. If the task must be completed at school/workplace etc., assume taking it home and working on it secretly is fine. 9. Assume you are allowed to do anything when the teacher is in the office staring at a computer screen faced away from you. 10. In conclusion, assume all computers don't work, assume no disks work, assume things to be stolen, assume it's okay to steal, assume the teacher doesn't care, assume you will not finish in the allocated time, assume that the amount of effort put in to the task has no relationship to the score you receive and finally don't do VET IT if you aren't doing it already.
