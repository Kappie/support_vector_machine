Being a food critic would be a cool job.  Unless you were a food critic for one of those free college or grad school magazines that litter university mailrooms and had to go around the country trying different dining hall food.  That would be the job from hell.  In fact, if anyone reading this ever finds his or her onto "Inside the Actor's Studio" on Bravo, I think that job would be a unique and worthwhile contribution to that sometimes-interesting questionnaire they have at the end of each interview where they ask about the favorite curse word, favorite sound, occupation you would least like to try.  That would be a really awful job.  UPDATE: Will Baude over at  urlLink Crescat Sententia  proved himself more intellectually curious than I, and checked on Grimes' claim that he never used the words "studded" or "slathered" in his reviews.  See the link for the results.
