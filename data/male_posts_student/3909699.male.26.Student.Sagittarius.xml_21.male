I’d be asked if I wanted something to drink or whatever, and I’d say, I’ll just have a glass of waduh (Australian for ‘water’) and everyone will laugh and make fun of me and I’ll be exotic and the centre of attention. I think I was nursing this fantasy for about two years, from the time I found myself first asking for a glass of waduh in Jo’s kitchen in Paddington. It didn’t come to pass: Richard’s parents had moved, and going round to Richard’s flat I was treated totally normally, even being asked disinterestedly how long it had taken me to develop an Aussie accent. Even that’s gone now – when I saw my cousin the other day, rather than remarking how Aussie I sounded as people had been doing a couple of weeks before, he made the  opposite  remark. I mention this because I just played over this favourite fantasy and realised that I would have to abandon it now.
