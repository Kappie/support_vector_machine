By the time I reached Fairfield, it was already eleven plus. Collected my tickets from Amelia who kept asking me to buy tickets from her over the past few weeks. Didn't really want to buy, but bought anyway to prevent her from further irritating me. Haha.  Almost immediately after I collected my tickets from her, Yuan Hao came and bugged me. Kept asking me to buy his dumb chicken wings. I had just arrived and didn't even have time to walk around and here this guy is pestering me! Oh man! So I just entertained him and bought a couple of dumb chicken wings. I didn't even feel like eating them lor. Shih Hui, your brother is just as crap as you.  Had a nice chat with Li Rong and Sydney, my adopted mother. Niang! Haven't seen them for a long time. The last I saw them was probably one year ago on the same occasion. I' really unfilial. Sigh. Better repent before it's too late. Anyway, was glad that we still keep in touch with one another through one of the best invention of all - the device called handphone.   Also saw the people from Senggam. Haha. You must be wondering what's that. Haha. Was a name Kelvin thought of to call our soccer team. He says its the cantonese pronunication of the word sexy! Unbelievable! Ya, as usual they were at the primary school basketball court playing soccer. Just like the good old days. Some things just don't change, do they? Anyway, this bunch of people is one of my closest bunch of friends in Fairfield. Haha. Just loved those days. Those days when we just stay back after school to slack our lives away and still do well for exams. Those days when we spend more time in school than at home. Those days when we will just play carrom as though carrom was the world. Sigh. I miss those good old days.  Talked to Joel as well. Joel has certainly matured tremendously since those days when he talked nonsense, fought and argued with his fellow cadets over the slightest issue. Now, everytime I see him, he is more sensible. He's not that bad after all. Glad to see him doing well in Fairfield. This guy will surely be successful in life!  Yuen Mun! I still don't believe you told Daniel to lie to his parents to go to church. Yes, I know going to church is a good thing and is important. But, it doesn't make any sense if you lie to go to church. Lying in itself is bad enough. Lying to go to church is worse! But, I think I must agree with you that certain things are very conflicting and complicated. But, what can we do?  Saw Mr Wee. Haha. Glad that he still remembers and recognises me. Was talking to him with Daniel. The whole time he was there telling us to study hard, to work harder. Sigh. We all know that. Especially when your prelims are three weeks away. Thanks for the encouragement anyway.  And how can I forget this. I saw Elaine Lim. Yes, I saw Elaine Lim. At first, they all were telling me that Elaine Lim seemed to have aged a lot but I didn't really believed them. But when I saw her today, I really couldn't agree more. She's not even 40 and she looks like she's fifty. Must be the stress of leading a school like Fairfield. Besides that, she seems to have put on a whole ton of weight. She must have tried to de-stress by eating. And it didn't work.  In conclusion, today had been an eventful day. However, this means that I must work extra hard the next few days to make up for the time lost today.  NB: I didn't really want to write the last paragraph. It sounds so lame. But I decided to put what I've learnt in GP to good use. So, I have written a conclusion. Hopefully, this conclusion is up to HHH's standards.
