Anyways it was the episode when Bam sends his parents to a nice hotel while him and other professional skateboarders such as Tony Hawk and Kevin Saab turn his parent’s house into a huge skate park. Oh, this was a good one! Every wall, every corner, ever inch of the house was covered with ramps. And in the back yard he had 2 mini half-pipes. Bam’s mom April loves her garden, so Bam showed his love by planting the 2 ramps on top of the garden. At one point, Bam and Tony Hawk made big-huge gashes on the sealing when going up one of the ramps. It’s funny, Bam’s buddy Brandon picked up Bam’s parents in his “ghetto limousine.” Serious, the roof of the limo was leaking as it rained. When April and Phil got to the house they thought that Bam had thrown so big party cuz there was roughly 40 cars at their house. The went inside to find out what Bam had done. April was freaking out, man! There sure were some good laughs that episode.
