We played some pool basketball, ate some hotdogs [although I didn't have one], and made a fun little dance in the pool. :)  I asked Tim about the other night--and how it seemed like they were blowing me off.. But it turns out I got the whole thing wrong. It was all in my head.  I always make my best attempt at looking at the bright side of things, but it's like my brain naturally tries to conceive the worst conspiracies....Damn you brain. Heh. Heh.  All I can say is I hope things stay good cause I'm still new to them....But they make me feel good.   Moral of the blog- Look on the bright side of things  THERE ISN'T ALWAYS A CONSPIRACY
