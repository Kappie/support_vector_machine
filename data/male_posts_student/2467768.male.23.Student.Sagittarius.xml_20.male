CSCI213           Java Programming Assignment Test 1 = 75%                   Java Programming Assignment Test 2 = 95%                   Java Programming Assignment Test 3 = 75%                   Java Programming Assignment Test 4 = 60%                   Java Programming Assignment Test 5 = 80%                   Exam = 18 June 2004 ????  Technically, I scored 38.5% out of 50% for my assignment. And I need 12% marks more to pass. But the stupid university states the rule that I have to pass my exam, in order to pass the subject ... Which means... If score 12% more, I still failed. But if I score 25%, scrapping thru the paper, getting 63.5%, means I straightly get a credit. Wierd top IT school in Australia ...  Anyway, I just pray to HIM that He will guide me and pass my subjects...  Amen.
