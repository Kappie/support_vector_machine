I need to go buy some shtuff before someone steals all my money.  See, I bought this casino yesterday, and I make $13,260 per turn.  Since 9:00 PM last night, I have been making this amount of money every hour.  I have about $180,000 right now, and I can't get rid of it before its stolen by some mean guy.  See why I'm angry now?  My injuries are healing! Like, yay!  My knee still hurts, but the chlorine from the pool did a world of good to it yesterday.  Normal people my age don't generally wake up until about 11:00 or 12:00, do they?  I didn't think so.  Damn.  I really wish I had something of a life... then I would be doing something today.  Haha, but I'm not.  Laura and I started a nice club, called the Club for the Lifeless, and yet another one called the Anti-Anti-Harry Potter Club.  We started an organization that associates all of these clubs under one name, The League of the Eternally Lawless (taken from our rather large disregard of the rules when we wrote our plays).  Don't like it?  Too bad, live with it.  If I had a dime for every time I felt this sad or this alone... I would be the richest man alive.  Even richer than that Bill Gates guy.  Dumbass.  I'm gonna go do something productive now.  Like watch the grass grow.  Bye everyone!
