You leave behind so many people that you are friends with, that you relate to, and chances are you will NEVER meet them again. I still feel remorse for when i left Active Worlds, that was probably the best experience i'd ever had in a game like that...  I still remember this person i knew named Charlotte... we started.... i think 5 towns together... good ones too, at least 6 people had lots and houses in our town. But then.... they raised the price from 20 bucks a YEAR to 12 bucks a month and everyone left.  You say i'm obsessed wif the internet, I say we lost some good people....
