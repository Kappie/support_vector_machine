Read Ephesians 4 and about how we all work together as one body of Christ.  I have absolutely what I did to occupy the time from 12-4 though, a big mixture of drumming, PS2, compy, and chatting with a lot of people on MSN. Then I got bored...  And went to play ball for an hour. Afterwards...  Came home, ate some food, and off to UCC for some cardio.  I actually ran 30 minutes nonstop burning around 360 calories *GASP I CAN RUN THAT LONG!* Did some weights, some more cardio, and then left for home.  Finally got some HYPE stuff over with. Canada's Wonderland is a green light with 8 confirmed people, and also I've FINALLY sent out the email for coffeehouse to WLAC.  I'm pretty tired now, probably going to head to sleep. First day of volunteer work tomorrow haha.  Later.
