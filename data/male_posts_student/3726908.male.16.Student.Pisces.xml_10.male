He slowly moves out of the forest he is in; he realized that if not for Karean, he could never find the hatch, getting in and out of the dense forest is much harder than he thought.  Nonetheless, by the time Tai Wu managed to get out, the day was setting with a field of orange over the sky above him. It has been 5 days ever since he got there, but he was more aware of his situation now…to get the champion for Fire Wielder.  He sat along a lone tree, observing Flamer. Recalling of all that happened in the fight, Tai Wu was enlightened and happy at the abilities of the sword.  Tai Wu, “This sword knows of what state it should be at the right time…as if it’s able to read my thoughts. Guess I’ve overlook its usefulness over its inflexibility.”  He raised the sword high with both hands, “Change into flame…” Flamer soon changed into flames…it soon returned to its usual state with a thought from Tai Wu. He repeated this action several times, as if a child playing with his newly found toy.  Soon, nightfall approached. Feeling exhausted…Tai Wu soon felt asleep with a fire burning nearby.  The chirping birds woke Tai Wu up from his deep slumber; looking around the area with drowsy eyes, Tai Wu realized that it was near noon now. The sun has broadened its rays across the land, various strange looking people traveling around as usual. However, something seems short.  Tai Wu, “…The Lightning strikes! They disappeared!” Getting up, Tai Wu rushes towards the town with the Lightning border.  Tai Wu reaches the town eventually, but he was much shocked by the contents of the town itself…  Tai Wu, “This is…this is just horrible.”  The previous lightning strikes were outstanding, but this time is different; buildings with splashes of red on them and unrecognizable matter that resembled minced meat appearing in some part of the area, the floor as well looked quite burned. Another significant piece is a detached arm with shaded white particles and purple blood still flowing out from the supposed joint area. The perimeter is big… it covered a whole patch, giving off a gory and disgusting feeling. Even though the place is a town, nobody was in sight…  Tai Wu, “What has happened…?” Walking around the dilapidated place that emits a rather foul smell, Tai Wu notices the blood were relatively fresh.  Tai Wu, “Fresh…” Glancing around, Tai Wu discovers a trail of blood that leads to a smaller path in the town. Attempting to follow this trail, a loud “Bang!” suddenly shifts Tai Wu’s attention away…the lightning border is closed now, trapping the whole town with it.  Tai Wu, “Damn, I’m trapped!”  Running towards the lightning border cautiously, Tai Wu swings the giant sword towards this magnificent fence. The rays that were in contact with the sword did get reflected and soon dispersed, but new rays of lightning placed it soon enough before Tai Wu was able to seize the split second time to escape.  Tai Wu, “Looks like…I’ll be staying here for some time.” He said with a somewhat dejected tone, although he finally managed to enter his known destination, he hadn’t a chance to escape it now.  Tracing back to the red trail, Tai Wu progresses gradually to a small and quite hidden building with the board sign in a language totally unknown to Tai Wu. Observing from outside, it seemed quiet and has dim lights in.  “Nni Airyahs”  Tai Wu thought, “Huh? What kind of shop is this? Still, I cannot be absent minded…danger may lurk in it.”  Positioning himself with Flamer, Tai Wu slowly approached the tiny and insignificant building. Carefully, Tai Wu opened the shop door and peered inside; only a few tables and a candle lit, it seemed to be an Inn.  Tai Wu, “Strange…” he stepped into the inn when a piercing pain was suddenly applied onto his abdomen.  Tai Wu, “What the hell!” He tried to shift himself, but the sharp object prevented him to do so.  Tai Wu, “Wu Jian swordsmanship: Stork picking its wings!” With a short twist and unexpected precise movement of both hands, the heavy blade was held pointing backwards. Tai Wu then injected a fast stab backwards; this amazing and quick action forced the piercing object behind him to shift out of place.  “Danger!” Strangely, Tai Wu’s sword was met with another tough object and a ‘Kiang’ sounded. Sensing something wrong with his expected result, Tai Wu dashed himself forward and confronted this new opponent.  Standing in front were three people, a short weak looking girl wearing thick glasses and Kimono with fair complexion and a vulnerable expression. A one armed man holding a strange looking weapon that juts out sharply at its tip. He was wearing rather tattered clothes with painful expression and several scars apparent on his face. Another man in long pants and shirt…relatively good looking and holding an exceptionally long Katana with handle and sheath distinctively made from lightwood.  Man in long pants and shirt, “Who are you?! What are you doing here and why?!”  Tai Wu, “I’m a fire wielder, I noticed the trail of blood outside and follow it here.”  The man looked towards the one-armed man, seemingly wanting to get instructions from him, the one-armed man just shook his head.  Man in long pants and shirt, “I have a few questions to ask you.”  Tai Wu thought, “What?! Again…?” he then spoke, “Alright…”  Man in long pants and shirt, “Firstly, where are you from?”  Tai Wu thought for a while before answering, “Jian Tai Wu from Cheng Du of China, I live in the Song Dynasty.”  All three people had surprised faces, guessing from their expressions, Tai Wu continued, “Are you three from a different time and world?”  Girl, “Shinto! We’ve finally found the fire wielder!”  The one-armed man stared at the girl for a moment, slightly anger by her exclamation.  Man in long pants and shirt, “…What is your condition to return to your world?”  Tai Wu now was confident that this trio was from another world and time…in other words comrades in the same situation as him.  Tai Wu, “My condition, to be the official Fire Wielder!”  Once again, the man looked towards the one-armed guy…after a short period, the one-armed guy nodded, but the indifferent look was still hanging on his face. The man asking the questions and the girl by now began to smile. Walking to Tai Wu, the man in long pants and shirt raised his hands for a handshake; “Sorry for the barrage of questions just now…I’m Shinto Kimura, the girl is Ayako Matsura and lastly my master Rinto Gareth.” Ayako then bowed down politely, “Nice to meet you Tai Wu.” She was soft and feeble, seemingly to be defenseless; Tai Wu was quite puzzled at how she could win any fights.  Rinto, “…” he just remained silent ever since the start.  Tai Wu thought, “Looks like what Karean has said is all true…there is indeed someone like us…”
