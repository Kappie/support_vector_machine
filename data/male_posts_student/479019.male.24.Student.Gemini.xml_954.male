It's kind of like Incubus' Megalomania or the  urlLink Hives ' Main Offender videos though... only fire-y.  I was playing this  urlLink Bush Game  today... er yesterday. Very amusing game from the makers of Emogame.  I've been listening to  urlLink the Adolescents  a lot lately. I'm all about the OC pride right now. Working at Diedrichs (an OC coffee chain), listening to the Adolescents, and I'm at the moment wearing an old Irvine wrestling shirt. I even just burned myself a So Cal mix CD heavy on Orange County bands such as  urlLink Guttermouth ,  urlLink Social D ,  urlLink Offspring ,  urlLink Ignite , etc.   Insomnia sucks...  ***
