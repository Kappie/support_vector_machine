One of my favorites is   Contact   in the  "Faith versus Reason"  category.  Other notables are   Jacob the Liar  , under  "Deontology versus Utilitarianism,"  and   Minority Report  , addressing  "free will and determinism, philosophy of law and theories of punishment, political philosophy, [and] desert and responsibility."    There are several movies here that I haven't seen but would like to:   The Lord of the Flies   (Contractarianism and the State of Nature),   Requiem for a Dream   (Relativism), and   Pi   (Metaphysics and Mathematics).  I am adding them to my NetFlix queue now...
