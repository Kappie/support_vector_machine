Anyways back to the show, the worst thing abotu the show was there were no moshing and no crowd surfing signs everywhere, but when MAH came on...no one really paid attention and like 5 people got thrown out after the first few songs. some stupid fool ran on the stage, then tried to jump into the crowd, only to aim for a spot that had no people...it was funny to see him fall on his face.  But anyways, the night was fun, Thank you francis geoff molly and kt for coming, I'm out tho, peace...  Just shut your eyes, and I won't bleed 'till you're sleepin'....  This Won't Stop - MAH
