Well, not  urlLink megatrobe . I will get the same ammount, but with a later exam. Damn business...  Well, I didn't really do much after last night's blog. I didn't bother revisng, but did a bit o' reading. Slowly getting through Harry Potter... I did a bit of physics this morning, for the extension tomorrow. Most of it looks quite easy, whereas most of chemistry looked impossible. I'm not too sure about wave interference, and amplitude and frequency modulation, but that's about all. I'll look over it again later. We don't have to learn the circuit stuff, do we?  And then will be statistics, which will be very easy, as was said yesterday. I'll have a quick look over that later too, just to make sure I get a C grade. A grade D would be very embarrasing.  I also took some more quizzes just now, not having much to do with my time. Here be the results:    -Perfect- You're the perfect girlfriend. Which means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't care about presents or about going to fancy placed. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy being around your boyfriend.    urlLink   What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Ahh, isn't that nice.
