A nice heel around 30-40 degrees continuous.  A few showers to cool us down.  But what's that you say? Why am I back on the net and not on some deserted island? Well its because 25 miles into the trip to the Berry Islands our sail rips in half.  Doesn't that sound exciting! Damnit.  The next day: Well this did give me a chance to give a hundred bucks back to the casino.  The sea dog in the slip next to us has a sewing machine we can use to fix the sail, but this may have been the straw that breaks Alex's back.  He is ready to come home and I have spent the morning trying to convince him to stay just one more week so we can do the deserted island thing.  We are so close and have suffered too much with too little payback.  To me this would make it all worth it. As for those of you hoping to come meet us, I hate to say it it, but its not looking good for yah.  It would take divine intervention at this point to make us last longer than another week or two.  So pray damnit.  I don't want to come home. :)  Pics of the good sailing:   urlLink Poundin through the waves.   urlLink One more.   urlLink Standin sideways.   urlLink Sleepin sideways.
