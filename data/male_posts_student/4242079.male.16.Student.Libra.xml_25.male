The only person from high school I can count on seeing every day is Karly Grimson. You may ask, why her? It is because we both work full time at the mall. When I was in high school, I had so much passion, so much emotion about everything. I didn't want what most people wanted. I wasn't out for money, I wasn't out for name brand clothes. I just wanted to live my life, help people as much as I could, be a good person. Now. I work at RadioShack, convincing people they need that $500 stereo instead of the $350 one. And for what? So I get a few extra dollars in my pocket? So I get a higher spot on the sales list? I'm everything I hate and I'm loving it.  There is no milk in my kitchen. And dammit, I want my cereal.  urlLink  postCount('nomilk');
