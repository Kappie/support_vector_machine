In my youth I traveled much, and I observed in different countries, that the more public provisions were made for the poor the less they provided for themselves, and of course became poorer. And, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they  did  for themselves, and became richer.  -Benjamin Franklin, The Encouragement of Idleness, 1766   The inherent vice of  capitalism  is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of  socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.      - Sir Winston Churchill         How do you tell a Communist? Well, it's someone who reads Marx and Lenin. And how do you tell an anti-Communist? It's someone who understands Marx and Lenin.    -Ronald Reagan         Communism doesn't work because people like to own stuff.       -Frank Zappa   Alas, it is all for naught.
