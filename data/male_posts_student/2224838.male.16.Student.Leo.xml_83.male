An electric shaver becomes huge and shaves everything in sight," Gondry told in the interview.  It seems fitting that he would be making a feature film of this nature because he has adapted many of his own dreams into some of his best music videos (Björk, Foo Fighters, Chemical Brothers). Make sure to watch out for this movie sometime later this year. Also, check out Michel Gondry's latest movie,  urlLink  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  , in theaters Friday.
