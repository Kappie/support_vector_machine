So...that should be fun. But, besides that, on the topic of girls. I'm tired of ranting. No one cares, and I'm beginning not to, really. Ranting has never done shit. I guess it's just the way of life. Girls just don't really give a shit about me, as much as I do for them.  Irony, however. I'm 100% sure if I ever announced the Arty special (ie- I'm gay), girls would swamp me. Why? Gay guys just  understand  girls so much better. So, I ask you, what bearing sexual orientation has on anything. Gay or straight, the difference is null. Everything I do and say now, wouldn't change if I were in fact gay. So what's the deal? Girls just want something to bitch about. So, anyway, I am in fact going out with this girl tomorrow night. So what's the point of this post? I know nothing will come of it, except maybe a temporary fuckbuddy. Please, clue me in, what is my problem?
