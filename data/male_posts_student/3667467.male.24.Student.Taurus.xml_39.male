We were down in Orlando last spring . . . . Anyway we all got salmonella and Rob got it BAD. Like he was shakin' and stuff, and shitting blood and everything, right? So one night we're getting back real late to the motel and Rob like can't make it . . . . And he just gets down and takes a SHIT, right there on the boardwalk! It was the fuckin' funniest thing I've ever seen! Hah ha ha . . . !   I don't have anything to add to this, except: if your cousin is so sick he has to deficate blood on the street, is it really funny? Oh well. But I feel bad for the people making out under the boardwalk . . .
