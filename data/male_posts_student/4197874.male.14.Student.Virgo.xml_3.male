It has almost been 24 hours since it had been up u.u;; I don't know if i wanna play RO because there are still a lot or people talking to me and i can't just end all these conversations with them XD but oh well i should chat with them while i can because i have to go to school next wednesday T-T well i went to registration earlier today and i got my class list I will share with what classes i have XP. Honors English 2, French 2, Phys. ed. 2, Modern World History, Honors Geometry, Honors Biology, Pre-Enginerring Graphics 2, Sophomore Theology. I like all my classes except history >.> i am no good at all that XP Right now me and a couple friends are making a dictionary or messed up words and i guess it will be how we talk for the rest of our lives so i guess i better go to know this XD Oh well i guess i should just stop talking now and send this so i don't kill people with all the content of my journal messages XD
