You have Paul Martin, an out of touch, quasi-liberal wannabe conservative. You have Steven Harper, a deranged, quasi-conservative, right wing extremist-nut. Lastly you have Jack Layton, a true NDP leader- completely out of touch with the sad realities of the country.  All of the men running for prime-minister are pathetic. The NDP has a great platform, but how stupid do you think people are? You cannot promise the world and have it all work out magically.  Sadly you can't raise corporate taxes without a serious negative effect.   Steven Harper is the worst of the three, he appeals to the intellectually disadvantaged by spreading fear, anger and lies.   Paul Martin is pompous and completely out of touch with reality, but he is the least harmless of the big three.  In all honesty I want to vote for the NDP... but we'll see.  I may vote Liberal, It's fairly confusing.  I will write more as the stupidity develop.
