And my nostalgia for three of the best weeks of my life (I've had probably two years of great weeks, but the last three go right on in there) is probably helping me forget the problems and issues of the first few days at Wake.  But so far, this has sucked.    There are a lot of factors.  I have no air-conditioning.  Because of that, I was incredibly tired all last night, and got little sleep due to the sound of night life outside my window mixed with the extreme heat in my attic dorm room.  My key card doesn't work...I only got in tonight because I was lucky that the Duke rep in our dorm was making rounds and saw me standing outside trying in vain to get my card to open the door.  The instructional staff doesn't live on-site; that won't be too big a deal when the kids are here (I don't think), but it means that for the past two nights, the residential staff has been on their own...which is fine, except the other two RCs know each other from college, so breaking into that grouping is proving tedious.  One of the current RCs just finished a camp at the Duke Marine Lab, and a staff member from her camp is there...an obnoxious girl with a big ass and bigger mouth, who follows us to meetings and turns every topic of conversation into what happened at Marine Lab... Dustin was so cute when he put his head on Dani's shoulder!  Remember when Seth had the stitches?   Sorry, but I don't give a fuck.    I do my best not to put inside jokes on this site, or really to post them in any public manner that may survive as documentation of a certain era.  When I was writing the cards for the kids and their lunch sacks, I did my best not to include any of the quips and phrases we came to know over the weeks.  This comes from my experience of packing the Rio Nueces apartment six weeks ago, and looking through my high school yearbooks.  I didn't remember some of the people who signed it, and hell if I remembered even half of the inside jokes.  So I was stuck to write something more meaningful than  Have a good summer , but that couldn't involve the element of humor that surfaced at that time, unless the event was so cataclysmic that everyone would remember it.    Things will improve when Marine girl leaves, and tomorrow afternoon when we really get to work.  If I can get a few more fans up in my room, that'll improve this tenfold.  A sexy girl in a tank top and skirt reading cultural non-fiction wouldn't hurt either.
