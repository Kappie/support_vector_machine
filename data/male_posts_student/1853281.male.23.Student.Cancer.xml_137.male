It should be a nice time for me to relax, and to catch up on homework, and some crafty things. Got my loom fixed yesterday, after letting it molder for several(4?) years in the basement without touching it. I suppose that I have become a little more patien in that time, because all it really took was some logic to figure out what was wrong, and some patience to actually fix it. Am hoping to get home soon to take care of some things i forgot, and to pick up my sleying hook and water my plants and see what has been delivered from my orders to Amazaon, so i shoulkd have lots of things to keep me occupied.Am going to try and make it to creative fibers so i can get some big knitting projects going. a sweater or something, and then sone nifty hats or scarves etc for christmass presents for people.  Spent time with my Aunt Elke yesterday, I love her a lot, but she always reminds me of how much one controls one's own happiness. I always come away from visiting with her with a new deternmination not to make myself miserable, and in the mood i have been in recently that is a good thing. So. Hopefully life will improve for me soon as i learn to take better care of myself and work to keep myself out of depression.
