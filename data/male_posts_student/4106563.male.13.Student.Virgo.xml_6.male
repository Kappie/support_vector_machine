I haven't read the bible or anything (because I'm an atheist), so I don't know excactly HOW the world is gonna end. But I have a pretty good idea: Everything will cumble, hell will freeze over, pigs will fly, and every single person will have to pay their bet money. Its nothing to worry about, I'm on medication, and I have felt paranoia every fucking second in my life.   :)
