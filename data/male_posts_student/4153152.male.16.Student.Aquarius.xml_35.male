I think it turned out alright, but you definitely need broadband to load it up at any convenient speed.  urlLink Go check it out.  This is what I've been working on in my free time for the last few days. I could have never done it without MS Frontpage.  I'm really,  really  tired, so I'm off to bed. I'll dole out more information tomorrow.
