Nipponsei have released a new single from Asian Kung-Fu Generation, the 4th opening theme to the show FullMetal Alchemist. I'm one of their greatest fans out there (they've done great songs). The name of the song is Rewrite.  Well, I really should be going to bed. So, until then, take care and good night (dark continent!).
