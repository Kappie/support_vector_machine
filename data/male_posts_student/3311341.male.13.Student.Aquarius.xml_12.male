It doesn't occupy mental thought, and instead physical. Anyway, everytime I walk around for two hours, which usually happens twice a week I think... A lot...  My thoughts trail away to creation of the world, my life - feelings, what other people think of me, and how I generally think. Often I find myself thinking of the meaning of a language, and what people REALLY mean when they say something. Not what they feel like, and how that relates to what a word specifically means, but what sort of communication they're trying to convey to me through the language. Try it sometime. You'll learn to loathe a simple chore.  In other news, Iraq was blown up today. Have a nice day, and sleep tight. You're next.   Things to think about: -If you don't have a reason to be better than someone, then don't critisize that someone.  -I've been "in love" for nearly my whole life, but now that I'm older I'm starting to think. If I believe in God and that he is the Trinity, then does that mean I'm going to heaven? If I believe there is a heaven, does that mean I'm gonna go there after I'm finished? Someone I know said that if you live on an island isolated from christianity, and you believe there is a creator of this, and blah blah blah, then you'll go to heaven, because you have no other way of discovering a God. But, yeah. I doesn't matter.
