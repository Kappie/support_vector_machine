I've probably said this before, but here's the thing: I really don't think any act or legislation is really going to change things. I think that the kind of thing that will actually benefit a nation occurs in the hearts of individuals. If neighbors won't take care of each other the federal government (presented here as faceless and impersonal) isn't going to do any better. I know what you're thinking. How very hippy of me. That was for the benefit of whoever it was that was infuriated by my past use of the word 'hippy.' I'm here to offend, it's true. Anyway, John Kerry gave a speech tonight and it was televised. So I watched it. I actually turned on the TV (a rare occurrence, these days) as he began talking. Before I go any further, understand that Bush or Kerry, it makes no difference to me. I've stuck up for Bush in the past, but only because I think people attack him for a lot of things that he doesn't deserve. I also think people hate him for reasons unknown even to them, but I'll get to that later. So Kerry starts talking and I feel this dull ache in my stomach that usually foretells vomit. It wasn't so much what he was saying ... it was more that he wasn't saying anything. For the longest time, he was just talking about himself and how great and moral he is. Then he started talking about how great and moral middle class America is. And then he began ranting on how evil corporate America is. And finally, he made the inevitable leap to how evil everything is about the current administration and how great and moral his own would be. It was the typical presidential candidate speech from as far back as I can remember: "things suck now, but I can make them better." And there were actually signs that said "America can do better" as well as "help is on the way." Which brings me around to the part that really disgusted me - the crowd. I was struck with the same horror that I feel whenever I see footage of Nazi rallies. The blind and widespread fervor for ... what? Empty words? I mean come on, how much of what Kerry is promising to do can he actually pull off? Look at how vague most of his promises were. How much can any one politician do? People were chanting "Kerry, Kerry" and going into hysterics whenever he said anything that  sounded  good. Sure, it all  sounds  great - that's the story of any semi-successful politician in history.Grain of salt, please. There are three kinds of people when it comes to politics: there are those who don't care at all (except when they're bitching about the government), or there are those who don't really care what is possible or realistic, who allow themselves to be completely brainwashed, and who take on a fanatic zeal that idealizes everything about their chosen belief and  attacks everything else  ... or there are those who really look at what is possible or not and how much these things are actually worth. I cannot stress how vitally important skepticism is when it comes to politics. I'm going to be voting in the upcoming election. I don't think my one vote is going to make a difference, and I'm not going to be outspoken for whoever I end up voting for. I'll choose the less-unsatisfactory candidate and hope things turn out for the best. Don't be shocked by my cynicism - I told you I hate politics. I'll try to do my homework and find out who I think is full of shit and who I think might actually do what they're promising, or even if what they're promising is worth my time. But in the long run, I really don't give a shit. If I want to change things, I'm not going to sit back and vote. I'm going to go out and change them. And the cause I stand for is spiritual, not political, so to hell with politics.
