I think we get along pretty well, which is a good thing. We've had two shows. First one was alright, first show... first show. Our second definately went a lot better than the other. We're really working hard on recording, we have everything done except vocals, which is going kind of slowly.   Anyways, I haven't been feeling very good for a while. I think I'm just getting sick of my daily routine, so the days have been going by really slowly. I really just need some change, something to wake me up from this never-ending dream. It's kinda like riding the bus, listening to emo music, looking out the window; kind of sad.
