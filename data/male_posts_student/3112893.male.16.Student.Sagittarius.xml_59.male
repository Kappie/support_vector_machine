February 1st, 2004  A Great Day That Ended Sadly  A day with Shannon that went just like any day with Shannon can be expected.  I woke up relatively late. I'd say about 9AM or so. And I got up and succumb to SC as usual. At around 11AM I got off the game and took a shower. Then my mother, sister, and I got into a fight about differences in mentality and it ended with my mom and sister leaving to sit in the car. I later went back and apologized and she said "oh, forget it" but I know what that means. It means "yeah, whatever. I'm still mad at you but I'll pretend to be the bigger person and just say 'don't worry about it." Whatever.  Anyway, after that my mom called my dad and my dad called me as I was leaving to see shannon at around 12:50. We talked and he gave me some advice such as "keep your mouth shut. Just listen and be frustrated but keep it in." I'll keep that in mind from now on. Anyway, after that I went to catch the bus and waited for 10 or so minutes for the Santa Monica West 720 at Beverly / Wilshire. When the bus showed up I realized I didn't have any dollar bills (but I forgot that I had dollar coins) and traded a 5 dollar bill for two dollars and 35 cents from another guy who was waiting at the stop. He was very grateful so after realizing I had dollar coins I didn't feel as bad about it.  Once I was on the bus I was happy enough because I was on my way to see my Shannon but this silly Los Angles group of people decided to "dance", not on the corner of the intersection, but rather IN the intersection. The bas couldn't be stopped and hit one of them in the arm or something like that. I didn't see it first hand but I heard a lot about it and the whole situation just seemed stupid. I hope the bus driver isn't held responsible for it. Anyway, after the first bus was stopped I got on the next bus, which was a 720 West Westwood bus and I told him I needed to get to Barrington and Wilshire so he stopped at the next stop and gave me an all day pass at no additional charge. After that I called Shannon on the phone and told her about the whole situation. Then the bus came and I hung up and got on.  When I got to my destination I was standing at the back door of the bus and this grouchy gay guy was mad at the driver and told everyone by the door to push it open (even though the door said "opens automatically"). The man then shouted at the driver saying that it's a crowded bus and a solid "Fuck you!" I then walked up Barrington and called Shannon again and talked all the way up. I hung up and asked her to let me in before I got there so I wouldn't have to wait so long, but I still ended up waiting a minute or two.  I hung out at her house for a bit and a few things happened... not a lot, I just waited for her to finish up her game, while surfing the net. Some drama occurred that's not really worth going into too much detail about, but whatever.  After this whole episode was done we went down to San Vincente and bought a subway and thought of stories to tell the parents in the event they ever asked what we did the whole time and came to a conclusion. We went to subway where she got a wrap and I went to ColdStone where I got my ice cream. We ate our food and went down to Peggy's shop. We hung around there for a while and when Peggy was done with her last client, she took us to get her a sub. Shannon and I wanted to go to Westwood and walk around but my mom wasn't up to that so we just went to her house and I talked to Peggy about how I felt regarding Shannon.  I told her about how I felt that no matter what I do, it feels like it's never enough with her and how my parents felt about her and why it was so hard to get a day to see her. She totally understood and was able to compare and contrast the two life-styles. I think that Peggy's a great lady and I still love Shannon. I want her to trust me and love me back but I don't know if she could do that in the same way she used to. 	>>meowMix  February 1st, 2004  Shannon and I  Are the feelings mutual?  I love Shannon but I don't know if she loves me. I feel so bad for not being able to do more for her and I only wish I could make her happy. I need Shannon to love me and care for me and need me and want me to be with her always, the same way I do. I miss her. 	>>meowMix  That concludes this installment of 'Blast From The Past'. Check back for tomorrow's episode.  I actually don't ever remember being THAT needy. How odd. Well, if the blog says so, it must be so because I don't lie in these things. I never lie anyway, I just forget or honestly remember things inaccurately :-\.  That is all. -- Feanor
