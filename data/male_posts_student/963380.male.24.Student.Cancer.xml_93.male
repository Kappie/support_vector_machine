An interesting experience to say the least - a lot like evesdropping really. I had the sense that I was intruding on the lives of the people to whom these stations belong. Weather, news, sports - all local yet not Local. In my travels I found Missouri, Maine, Iowa, Michigan, New York. I tuned into one station that never identified itself - it seemed to be an evangelical broadcast - Listening further I noticed that it was a religious broadcast refuting modern miracles - the kind with no proof. Refuting them with scripture - citing passages that demonstrated how God's miracles were usually performed - in front of witnesses with verifiable facts usually with a message. A fascinating take on a subject usually clouded by charismatic charlatans and elaborate smoke and mirrors. Not at all what I expected.
