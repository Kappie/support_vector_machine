(Sorry in advance if there are typos.)              The  Kid Napping  	Dede was a little six year old girl, from Louisiana, with long black hair. She had a little stuffed fox who was with her all the time. 	One day she was dropped off  at the park with her friend Dean, “Want more tea Dean? What about you Stan? Not in a talking mood...eh?” 	“Nope!” Dean sharply replied, and the stuffed animal, named Stan, sat in the little pink chair with an empty daisy cup in front of it. “What is that Stan? Some one is calling me?” Dede turned around and saw a tall, distinguished looking man in front of her.  	“ Hello Dede, dear. How are you today?”  	 “GRANDPA!” She screamed as she jumped into his arms. “Do you want to have some tea with me, Dean, and  Stan?”  	Dean blurted out, “Hi!” as soon as Dede finished the sentence.  	“Who?” he asked  “Stan?” 	“Yeah. My stuffed fox.....” She lifted Stan up in the air.  	“Ah, yes...I remember now. I always thought he was a teddy bear. Uh, Dede?I need you to do something with me....Do you want to come?” 	“Sure Grandpa! Just let me get Stan” She got up and ran over to him and picked him up. “Okay...Bye Dean!”   	Dean just sat in the pink flowery chair...looking depressed, over his friend who had just left him there. 	“Good lets go.” He replied.  	“Were we going...to get some candy? Or how about  the toy store? Is Mama and Papa coming with us? ”  	“No dear. We are going to visit a very special friend of mine. She has wanted to meet you for a very long time. You are going to like her. I promise.”  Her Grandpa looked over at her and gave a weary smile.  	The two of them got into the car and drove for about half an  hour and  into New Orleans,  then  made a left,  into the fishing district.  	“Wow Grandpa! Look at all those fish!” Dede looked in amazement at all the big fish and  the other aquatic animals they passed by.   “Can I get one to take home?” 	Her Grandpa only made a chuckle at her question. “ Were do you think we will keep it? These fish are way too big for our house.” 	Dede sighed in disappointment, “ Are we there yet?”  	“Yup....Here we are.”  	 Dede opened the door and swung her legs around so she could jump out of the car.  	“Grandpa? Why dose this place give me the creeps?” 	“It is just a place you are not used to, dear”  	“Oh....” She said while looking to the left and noticing a scarecrow and an old swing set that screeched with the wind. “Stan..” she whimpered, “ Please protect me.”  	Dede also noticed the number of the house was 656, as her Grandpa pushed the door bell, that played an eery song. A squat, fat, woman with short blond hair answered the door, and in a scratchy voice screamed out, “ LUE! How are you darlin”  	“Hey, Matilda. This is my granddaughter Dede. I told you about her yesterday.” 	“Ah yes...Uh, dear? What is that in your arms?” 	Dede held Stan tighter to her chest. “His name is stan.” 	“Oh, how...adorable!” She replied back, “ Come. I will get you a snack.” 	“Ok...” Dede said, and walked into the kitchen for a snack. When the next noise Dede  heard, was the door slamming shut and her Grandpa disappearing. “ Were is Grandpa going?”  	“Oh, he said that he was going to go run some errands. So he wanted me to watch you.” 	“Alright. When will he be back?” 	“Um...dear? I have something to tell you.” 	“Yes?” Dede answered looking up innocently, while trying to feed Stan. 	“Your Grandfather said that he did not want you. He said that your parents hated you, and do not love you. So he brought you here to live with me. I have a nice room all setup, up stairs for you...ok?” 	Dede’s eyes started to water up. “What....I ...  He....Left me here? With you?” 	“Yes dear...I will be your new guardian from now on. Now go up stairs and wash up for diner.”  	“No..” Dede said with her eyes watering more.  	Matilda jumped up and smacked Dede across the face,“What? you little brat! You will do what I tell you, when I tell you to do it! Understand!” 	“Yes, ma’am.”   	“Hello, I am home!” Lue called out.  	A short, lanky man named Bob walked into the room, “ hey Lue. Uh, were is De?” 	Tears started to stream down Lue’s eyes. “I don’t know! I went to the park to get her and she was not there.  I did not see her fox or anything. A lady said she saw a woman walk off with her..But I did not see anything. I looked all day for her.” 	Terrified Bob sat down. “Judy dear! I need you to come here for a minute. Your father has something to tell you about our daughter!”  	A tall woman wearing white cloths, and blond hair came out of the back room. “Yes Father? What is it that you want to tell me? Is something wrong?”  	“Yes baby. You may want to sit. It is terrible news. Dede is missing.” He said.  	“Oh my God.....How? Were? When?” She asked in shock. 	“Today at the park. A lady said she saw a woman walk off with her..But I did not see anything. I looked all day for her.” He repeated.  	“Oh. Bob, call the police. Dad, I need you to come with me to the park.” 	“I already talked to the police. They said there is nothing that they can do but put up posters. They helped me look and talk to people.” Lue testified.  	Judy looked up at her father. Eyes bloodshot and watery as well. “Oh. I...think I need to be alone for a while.” Judy got up and went into her room. Bob soon started to follow but was stopped by her father.  	“Bob, you are a bad father and should have been there with her...maybe then Dede would still be with us.” 	In shock Bob looked at Lue and saw a small grin on his face, and then muttered profanity under his breath. “You....Took her? Didn’t you?”  	“Your words. Not mine” he immediately responded.  	“I can not believe you would do this to your family...Oh! Wait till Judy finds out!” 	“That is not so wise..If you want no harm to come to your child, you will not tell Judy.” 	Bob looked up at Lue and Punched him so hard in the face, that his nose cracked.  	“You little......Oh! You are going to pay for that.....and the only reason I did this, this to protect her from you and your kind. It is all devil magic!” 	“So you did this, because of what me and Judy believe in?” 	“Voodoo is not a belief or a religion, it is wrong!” Lue yelled. 	 I hope Judy will be alright, Bob thought as he walked past the man and out the front door.  	“Were are you going? To have a secret cult meeting!?” Lue yelled out the front door, and Bob just kept on walking. 	  	Judy lay in the fetal position on her bed. Saying a prayer to herself. “Please almighty, protect my beloved daughter by what ever means necessary. I wish for part of my soul to be with her in this dark time for us and her. Amen.” and she rocked herself to sleep.  	   	Mean while Dede was in her new room holding Stan in the rocking chair sobbing in the corner of the empty room. Besides her and the chair she was in, there was a bed and a dresser, and nothing more.  	“I miss my Mommy.” she cried. Suddenly, she felt a little wiggle in her arms, and heard a little voice say, “I can’t breathe! Open your arms a bit!”  	Dede did what the voice told her, and out of her lap Stan jumped fourth.  	“Hi, Dede!”  Stan yelled.  	“Stan!” she yelled in amazement, “How did you...? Why are you? ” 	“Ah, Dun worry about it. I am here to watch over you though. Noone else is here to guide you in life. So, here I am!” 	“YAY! But why do I feel sad still?”  	“Dede I want you to come here for a minute. and get nice and close so you can hear me.” 	“Yeah Stan?” 	He retched up and slapped her so hard that it left a little red mark, “I am not here to answer life’s questions! Only to keep you in line! Got it?”  	“Sorry...You are kinda mean for a stuffed toy. Um..I have one more question? If you do not mind?” 	Stan let out a little sigh, “ what?” 	“ How do I get home with my Mommy and Daddy?” 	Stan smiled and then chuckled,  “Well, that is one good question. I have no idea though. I can only give you one peace of advise, and that is just ride this scenario out. That is all you can do. You are six for Christ sakes.”  	“Christ?” Dede asked 	Stan let out another sigh, “ I will tell you later. It is bed time, and you need your sleep. So got to bed, and sleep tight, I will wake you up in the morning...ok?” 	“Alright!” she exclaimed, and jumped into bed, “Good night Stan....Love you!”  	 Stan blushed as much as a stuff toy could, and then told her, “G’night.”   	The next thing Dede knew she was in a deep sleep, and at home with her family, and Stan was sitting  in her lap laughing at the funny stories of her Grandfather.
