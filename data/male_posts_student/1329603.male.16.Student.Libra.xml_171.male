Liv went down a lot in my coolth rankings yesterday by saying that, I quote, "All men are nobs". This really offends me, I'm sorry, I know it's a general statement that a lot of people say but it does. Why, I hear you ask? Well... I tend to regard myself as fairly a-typical as a man, in that I don't have girlfriends for s... I don't have girlfriends, I think using my head rather than my lower region and I enjoy doing Les Mis and things like it more than hitting a piece of leather round a field (not to say I don't like football, I do, but I prefer performing). In all necessities, I am a heterosexual man - I like women in that way, I have a penis, my chromosome alignment is XY, and I like Led Zepplin. But in personality terms I am neither a typical man, nor a typical woman. I am me. So I think is one of those situations where I'm being over-the-top, perhaps a little snobby in my dislike of Liv's comment. It continues to offend me, though.  That took me too long, and I have to go about now. Sorry, peoples, I'm in a raaaage. Nah, I'm not, I'm not too bad actually. Off to Les Mis. Yay.  Quote of the day: "Under the wide and starry sky, Dig the grave and let me lie; Glad did I live and gladly die, And I laid me down with a will.  This be the verse you grave for me,  Here he lies where he longed to be, Home is the sailor, home from sea, And the hunter home from the hill.
