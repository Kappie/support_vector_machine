Martin's is this little cafe in the heart of Brookline Village.  By little I mean, my dorm room is bigger.  The size is one thing that adds to the appeal of the place.  About as wide as two short guys could stretch their hands across, divided in half by the counter seating.  Behind the counter, a grill, stainless steal ventilation, shelves of food, (mostly eggs), a small back room, 3 two person tables and 4 four person tables.  It's usually not staffed by more than 3 people, obviously family.  There are pictures and plaques on the wall indicating that is also cherished by others.  Firemen, police, Madonna.  I love it.  It's home.    It's also owned by Albanian Orthodox.  I absolutely love coincidentally becoming involved in someone's life because of the Church.  The Church, like this cafe, is the best kept secret in the world.  For me personally, I hesitate to tell people about this cafe because I like the escape it provides.  Good vibes.  Good people.  Then I come to realize that they're Orthodox.  What a wonderful thing!    Though it's the best kept secret, the Church is everywhere.  It's this secret that we want everyone to be in on, and yet...shhhhhhhhhh...it's a secret!  It's home too.    The sun is shining today.  It feels like Arizona.  I miss Arizona.  There is no place on earth like that desert.  And obviously, there is no place like home.  Whenever I think of home I think of the movie Gods and Generals.  General Robert E. Lee, (not the white supremacist icon) but the REAL General Lee, was fighting for his home.  My factual historical memory is horrible.  Where was it?  Georgia?  Carolina?  Virgina!  Yes. Thank you.  Virginia.  Robert Duvall played an amazing homesick General Lee who elevated Virginia to such a utopic status.  My home isn't perfect, but it's perfect for me.    In a few days I will be in Elenie's home, of which she hasn't been able to talk about anything else in the past month.  I can't wait to meet everyone, to experience someone else's home.  I live for meeting new people and seeing new places, especially someone so meaningful to me.  It should also prove to be a pivotal time in our relationship.  Keep us in your prayers!   Leaving Hellenic, and Polemanakos is always so bittersweet.  We love it here and yet we cannot wait to leave.  Pray for us.
