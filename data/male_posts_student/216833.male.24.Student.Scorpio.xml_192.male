Pull up in the lot and it's not exactly what I thought. Right when we get in and sit is some seats we think are alright, this 'thing' turns around to ask me a question and I'm not really sure it's a dude or a chick. One of those gender bender situations. IT's PAT!!!! IT had very long hair, john lennon style glasses, large "boob' like chest that was a little on the hangy side, and a very square shaped body. Also the voice was high-pitched and there was a well groomed beard on the chin. It was very thin, more to be ambigious with i suppose. The IT asks me for a ride downtown after the class. FUCK! I so wanted to be a prick but it was really only a ride so I oblige. After that, the IT didn't bother me to much. Oh the IT's name was Mageda. W T F ! ! ! I am just an asshole I guess. I just don't want people to bother me. So I learned alot of great things and I am really excited. I found out that all of the European Starlings found today in North America-and they number in the 200 million range-are descendants of approximately 60 pair of birds introduced in New York City's Central Park in the early 1890s. A society dedicated to introducing into America all of the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare set these birds free. These are birds that we don't except at the center. They are not native. All native birds are protected and illegal to have in your home, under your care. But if you want a pet Starling, go for it. Even a piegon. There is no law saying you can't - at least in california. I'm sure you've seen a ton of Starlings.  These birds are related to the mynah bird and are very good at talking. Even better than parrots. So if you want a bird that talks alot, grab a baby starling right about now. haha. I saw red-tailed hawks that had been hit my cars, owls, kestrels, and turkey vultures. Very interesting.  Oh! I worked today, it was dull. So I'm off tomorrow, but I'm going to bed now.  bye   current mood:  determined current music: Hot Hot Heat - Bandages
