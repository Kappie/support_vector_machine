I had my shower and I went to go read the newspaper outside in the sun. It's a warm day. I've been meaning to clean my room, and I really probably should, but I'm just under so much stress from my dad and my brother. Today, I went into the kitchen to cook hamburger. I kept getting yelled at from both of them! Finally my dad backed off and it was just Ryan yelling, then my dad started yelling at Ryan because he wouldn't shut up! I of coarse poured Crystal Light on Ryan which made the situation really bad for a minute, but then he had a shower and changed and everything was calm again. Besides that, I talked to a few people online and I might go for a walk in the trail.
