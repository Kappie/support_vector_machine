"and i doubt - that i will ever find out - if there's a way to get out - of feeling all alone - cause lately - i've been thinking – maybe - that no one's going to save me - i'll do it on my own.....” ---never there  i'm blasting  urlLink hoobastank  tonight, singing along as best i could (which prolly isn't very good) and i realize  urlLink that they have some really kick-ass lyrics . almost as good urlLink  linkin park's lyrics , just not as depressing.
