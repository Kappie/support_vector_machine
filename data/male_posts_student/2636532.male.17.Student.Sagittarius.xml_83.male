But seriously though, i think that despite the inevitable downside of the internet it has benifited the world. I'd never talked to someone from Australia or keep in touch with my friend from the USA without it. It makes seemingly unsurpassable distances close with the click of a mouse or a tap of fingers on the keyboard. there are whole communities online and a community for every interest imaginable, with the internet no one needs to feel rejected, no one judges race, religion or culture. everyone can be equal. Buuuuuuuuuuuut...then i realize that there's life out there besides in this little box infront of me and that if you're reading this i have advice for you, go outside. with all the technology now few truly appreciate the perfection of nature, there's a fine line between healthy harmless net use and net addict. -Matt
