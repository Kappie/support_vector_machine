It's painful to say we as it wasn't me, it was a bunch of people who happen by some fluke of chance to have been born in the same country as me led by the husband of a failed pop star. Harsh but true.  And we all know what the international symbol for bad drivers is: Red cross on a white flag.  The england vs Portugal match was not the first time we lost against a host country's team: the only other times we played against host teams in the history of the european championships(ironic name!) was in 1980 against Italy and 1992 against Sweden. Both we lost.   So in the World Cup 2006, english people, one and all, support a good team!
