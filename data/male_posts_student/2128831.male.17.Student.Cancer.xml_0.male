But, Eric and Matt broke up and then Paul decides to drop Will and go for Matt.  A little more tatter on my heart... But grrarg so I moved on to another very cute boi named Ryan.  Ryan is an amazing boi.  He remembers me from a time that I went dancing.  Well, one problem with this boi, he is 45+ minutes away... I wish it was easier.  And then again, there is now this boi in Cheaspeake named Brandon, really, really artsy and talented and welll available.  He is a complete gay virgin, all over one hundred percent. Gosh!  I swear being gay is soooo frickin' hard!  But, alas I would have it no other way.
