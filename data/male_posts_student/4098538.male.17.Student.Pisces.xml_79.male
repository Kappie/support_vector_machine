I text Mandy, saying I wanted to see her and stuff, and she rang me and asked if I wanted to go over when she finished work. Obviously, I did. She was working until 4.00 so I got the bus to there and waited for her to come out. Then we got the bus to her house. There was no one in so we got to slob on her sofa which was pretty nice. We had some food and watched the TV for a while. I looked in her fridge and thought I saw coleslaw, so I made the noise you make when you see something you love, only to realise it wasn't coleslaw. Then I saw something else and made the same noise, and again... it wasn't coleslaw. Damn my eyes. But then I did find some coleslaw! Yemateeee go me mate! I had to leave because she had to go to her dads. GOD I HATE HIM. Anyway, as we were waiting for my bus, I threw her shoe into someone's garden 'cause she threw my hat into a tree! I found that quite funny but she didn't, and because my bus arrived, we had to leave each other on a bad note. I hope she isn't too mad at me still. Anyway, I better go. I dunno why, because there's nothing to do. But still...
