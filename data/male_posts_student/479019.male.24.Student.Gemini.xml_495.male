I went to Tijuana's to pass off the Dropkick Murphys CD to Steff and ended up sticking around for some beers while the girls danced. I know I could do the whole dancing thing if I really wanted to, but it's not my thing. There have only been a few times were I really wanted to dance, but of course there was usually a young lady as motivation. Otherwise it's just me going with the flow and hanging out with my good friend beer which always satisfies.  Tomorrow I should call Wild Rivers, and get some reading done before going to the show with Steff. We're supposed to get some Ethiopian food too! Oh man that's gonna rock. That shit tastes good for something so simple. Then it's gonna be some good music.   I've been listing to the DKM for the past 2 days and that new CD is really growing on me. The more I listen to it, the more I like it.  Tomorrow should be eventful.  ***
