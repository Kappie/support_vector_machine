Right crossover 3. Left back over 4. Kick (right then left, 45 degrees) 5. Twist 6. Throw 7. Follow through Posted by: JP / 7:45 PM Saturday, March 27, 2004 More posting like 10 seconds after the previous post. School sucks, CAPT testing next week and I know I will pass but its too much pressure, you have to pass or you wont graduate I mean really how stupid is that and plus most of the test is unrepresented there are basically no right answers so hey I think laterally and my answers are right to me and maybe not the tester. I think I got like 17/45 on my French test which I will bomb undoubted. And my polish test I broke 55% another test Tuesday but I think I will do a bit better because I forgot the days of the week SRODA damn it. I want my PS2 back so at least I can drown myself in senseless killing or something. Have homework to do but hey I forgot the notebook so FUCK it. I also went to track this morning it wasn't that bad, hips I cant forget hips and I cant 5 step quickly because I will end up trying for a 7 step but not finishing with a kick, maybe I should read up and form some, you know because I have time, because I am a lifeless nerd with no true friends no life, and no guts. She was there a bunch of times I could have asked her, when we where talking about college or something or I could have went to do some laps and just by chance she was there and I would stop to talk and possibly flirt but she seems to be friendly with all the guys she's around, even with john or that other kid. Posted by: JP / 6:06 PM Well it has been a while since I have posted. I now have an official web site create and hand edited by Moe. Also there is a debate team section and ARC section. While on the topic of ARC, our launch got bucked beyond human belief. I found out what was wrong and Constantine tried to blame it on us but if he knew anything about racketeer which he says he does he should know a lot more about multistage and why you use tape and he should have stopped the launch if he though the rocket was going to be un safe. Another note on Constantine, he's going with Kelly a freshman who is way out of his league to pin dance tonight and alas I couldn't top him, I couldn't get a date, I mean I probably could have or I cold have taken Jane but you know, I should have asked Rachel but then again I think Jesse would be a bit creeped out about me going with his sister, Ranting of a mad man this is. I guess I have a lot of time to work on my 5 step in javelin and disk and shot. Fuck what a bitch I should have bought tickets to go and hang out with chuck and tino and tiff and Sean but hey I'm an idiot, and plus my parents would have to make a big deal about it and I would have to shoot myself plus I would have to stand up to minton for not working lights but hey I didn't know, even though I did, and yeah I don't know if I mentioned it but I do have a website that I created and you know doing stuff to but I'm keeping it a secret from my friends because I have a lot incriminating shit in this blog and will on that page. Posted by: JP / 5:59 PM Wednesday, March 17, 2004 Hey guess what 4 more inches of snow, in the middle of March, I stayed home today missed a lot of homework and class work, but hey I learned to use the menu command which is cool and now I wont need a hundred million small commands but rather one really really long one. ARC should be launching tomorrow but alas we aren't but we are building and I am considering to go running tomorrow after school to about 3 you know until the girls start their practices so I can talk to Rachel possibly. Debate team might as well disband because we haven't had any meetings recently, and next year we will have like 5 members Posted by: JP / 5:01 PM Monday, March 15, 2004 They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now. You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or sincere, but that they are as confused as you. You look at your job...and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't. One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward. You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you. Or you lay in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person. One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap. Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic. You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself.....and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender! What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out." Posted by: JP / 6:06 PM Thursday, March 11, 2004 Well it is time to start talking about track! Well conditioning is hell even though it only is one hour i can't wait till the practices are 3 hours. Nothing else to say. Posted by: JP / 7:03 PM Wednesday, March 10, 2004 Well time to post once again, I don't know how I will be able to do NaNoWriteMonth if I cant post everyday and be very wordy. Well I learned who likes me today, and that was ohhh so fun, Jane or Quasimodo as she is called. Damn I would have retired McGowan and Constantine kept it a secret so at least there was a chance of some one good looking liking me. Well its the middle of the week and Polish class wasn't bad, I didn't do well of the test, and a test if French I thought I did well on because I am good at correcting sentences, I BOMBED , that is BOMBED for those who don't know how to read Posted by: JP / 8:18 PM Monday, March 08, 2004 Yeah that's what's on my computer \/\/\/\/\/ down there annoying because you now have to scroll all the way down father to read any other random ranting of a mad man. Well today was very fun, went to English did hypocrites then the library for 2 hours for polish and other assorted homework and then I started the baking soda lab with is oh so fun. Then I ended with more CAPT practice in Algebra 2 which was beyond easy but just boring. I have track conditioning tomorrow and I get to hand in all my sheets along with my goals. My goals for those who don't know yet, are as follows: 100 Ft - Hammer 100 Ft - Javelin 92 Ft - Discus 30 Ft - Shot >30 - 200  And guess what pin dance is coming up so I don't know what I will do, I think if I am going to go I should bring someone and I have to top Chuck who is bringing a senior and constantinos who is bringing a hot freshman. I think I might as out Carlie or maybe Rachel, but I don't know maybe Jesse will get mad at me for going to the dance with his sister. Posted by: JP / 2:38 PM Saturday, March 06, 2004 1.

But i get to go to Iggy's house to work on the rocket at 1 probably maybe. I have to find an artist, a musician, and a writer who each have a work that defines me. Posted by: JP / 12:44 PM Thursday, March 04, 2004 Well time for an update, have homework to make up from being sick, debate team is trying to raise money, like every other club I am in. Odd fellas show tomorrow but I don't think I will go, but Socom game tonight, probably will play, no life nothing else is coming to mind except I need to post some links for you people. Posted by: JP / 5:39 PM Monday, March 01, 2004 Well stayed home from school because I was sick. Lets recap yesterday, I went o church, that surprise party, which wasn't that bad. Some not bad looking girls, but they possibly be related to me. Well the I did my brooks assignment, and that dumb paragraph I didn't do before. I guess I only didn't do my launcher or workout. Well ok that's all for now Posted by: JP / 11:26 AM Saturday, February 28, 2004 Well time to update on the completedness of my list. By my count I have finished 6 things on my list. I have gone to football, done my english project, order engine mounts, contact constantinos, get the engines ordered and fasting. Posted by: JP / 6:23 PM Ohh yeah i also was reading a friends blog, and in it he was professing his crush for this girl my friend have liked for a while now. And now this should become interesting, but the person they are fighting over isn't that great. I mean I see what they are talking about, she isn't that bad looking she is smart but not something to fight over. Posted by: JP / 7:48 AM Well I'm going through my bookmark that I got with downloading Mozilla, which is a superior open source web browser, and I found this cool websites, the open directory project. It is this project to clean up the internet and categorize it for free and people can become editors of categories, so I'm thinking of editing the throwing portion of a track and field category because I'm interested in. Posted by: JP / 7:44 AM Friday, February 27, 2004 Well I fell sick. I have a shit load of stuff to do this weekend. 1. Order engine mounts for rocket clun 2. Contact Constantinos about engines 3. If he doesn't have them, order them. 4. Redo my entire launcher. 5. Find a place where I can get a launch rod. 6. Workout 7. Two different parties on Sunday 8. Football on Satureday 9. Project Due Monday 10. Sleep 11. Fasting 12. Church 13. Notes for US History 14. Assignment for US History  There are probably some thing im forgetting and I know I will never complete everything. Posted by: JP / 7:54 PM Thursday, February 26, 2004 Well I think before I start putting goals online I should put a little about myself. I am right now a 15 year old sophmore at Bunnell High School. Bunnell is in Stratford and is like most towns of a similar sizes, bt normally boring as hell. I am what some people term, a "nerd" or a "geek." I do a bunch of clubs, Aeronautics and Rocketry Club, Future Business Leaders of America, Debate Team, French Club. I also do Indoor Track and Outdoor Track. Well I will post on these clubs tommorow or some other time to keep you interested though heres an interesting link > > > http://www.nomoreaolcds.com/ Trust me you will love that. Posted by: JP / 9:18 PM Well I also want to post want I want to do in track this year. I want to throw over 100 feet in hammer, over 30 feet in shot, over 100 in disk, and over 90 in Javalin. Well those are my goals and I know they are unachievable by me but hey aim for the moon, even if you miss you'll land amoung the stars Posted by: JP / 6:32 PM Hey! This is my first blog entry. I don't know why i created this, maybe to create an outlet for things i don't want to tell anyone I know. It's like no one acutally cares or they would make a huge deal of anything. They are kind of like the people To Kill A Mockingbird. They are like Maycombs' citizens, they are giant gossips and everywhere is backstabbing but I guess that's High School. This is cool because this is a site no one, I know, knows about. Posted by: JP / 6:29 PM
