Firefighters had to be called to an English hospital when the hospital staff was unable to cut titanium nipple rings from the chests of two teenagers who came in complaining that their nipples were sore.  The firefighters used bolt cutters to get the rings off.  That probably didn't help much w/ the soreness, though.     That is pathetic.  Though, it doesnt evoke any sympathy or sadness from me, so i guess it's not really pathetic.  Hmm... we need a new word that is similar to pathetic, but one that means "evoking scorn or contempt".  I'll get my crack team of monkeys on it right away.
