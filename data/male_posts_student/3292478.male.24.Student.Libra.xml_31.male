After his world record for fastest nomination (he nominated  Kitten  for the luggage deprival) he has subsequently come up with the years greatest quote.   urlLink     Discussing her mental state in the BB house he said she had  'as much stability as Rik Waller doing the Riverdance on a tea table '!!! Brilliant! Although very annoying, he'll be one I won't mind staying in the BB house!  Another one who is a possibility for staying longer is  Dan .   urlLink     There is definitely something there that he's not telling everyone, and he's looking less annoying than the rest of them at the moment! Plus! He looks rather like BB4 stalwart  Jon Tickle !!   But I'm still sticking with my final 3 !
