(-_-;) *for the record, i'm not exactly searching*  what have i learned? i'm probably the most hopeless hopeless romantic in existence. :D  completely wrong thought of the day: if i really want to take over the world (which i do), i must abandon this whole facade of romanticism, for this is a potentially lethal weakness. i must train myself in the art of cold-hearted, cold-blooded, devoid of soul or conscience sorta evil doings, such as, say, putting the cookie jar on the top shelf so my little cousins can't reach. heeheehee... hey jane... get me off this crazy thing... called love... O_o
