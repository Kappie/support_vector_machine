I was watching it today and i love to hear the dialogues again, that one about the royale with cheese is good, also Ezekiel 20 somethin, somethin.The dark humor in it makes you feel bad about laughing, but it just makes you love this movie even more, it is even sometimes cartoonish and cynical ina very good way. Uma looks pretty in this movie, prettier than in any other movie ive seen her, maybe because of the black hair. The soundtrack is also good, Quentin Tarantino carefully and gracefully chose the adequate song at the right moment. Men what a couple Tarantino and Copolla make, both great writers and directors.
