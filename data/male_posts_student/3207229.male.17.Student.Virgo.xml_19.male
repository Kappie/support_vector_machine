Some would say this is unpatriotic. It is not. I believe in the happiness of my country's people and I believe people would be happier if they devote their energy of supporting into the team that wins. See I'm patriotic.  The strange paradox is this: I'm being patriotic by encouraging people to be unpatriotic. Hehe.
