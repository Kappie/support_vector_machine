My relationship is falling apart, all my friends are in this little box and live 1/2 a world away and I am here alone trying to cope with this shit I have been putting up with for months now. I am tired and need a break. I just need to get the fuck out of here for a few weeks. If i only had the money. I have made some great new friends and they keep me sane these days. As for Peter, well, I don't know if we'll be together much longer, if this crap keeps up. I am not happy and it is beginning to wear down on me more than usual.   I am just an irritable mess lately, not to mention that the weather outside is frightful. that does nothing to help my mental and emotional being. So im sitting here jamming to launch.com all alone here. I'd rather be alone with myself then in the room with someone who doesn't want to be with me. is this the in good times and bad times test??? well i think i am failing. im not sure what to do at this point.   that's all i have for right now, will write more later.
