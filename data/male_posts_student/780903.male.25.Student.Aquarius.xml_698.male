My day is tomorrow.  Today, one of the four people on panel wasn't there.  I have no idea if there were consequences.  Regardless, this panel system, while nice on every day besides the one you're on panel, seems sort of ineffective in getting people to actively do the reading each day and prepare for class.  But I guess in a class of over 150 students, what else can they do.  Time to read.
