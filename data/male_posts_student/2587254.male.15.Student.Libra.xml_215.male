Good news for baddy today was that I actually won more than I lost... I think.  Wait never mind I was 2-3. Hey that's still 40% ehehe. But two of the loss games were singles games, as I got my butt whooped by Jane and Gavin. Against Gavin something like 15-3, and 15-6 against Jane. Yup....my singles skills are horrible =).  But there was still more to my day.....as today was a long and tiring day.  So I got up at about 1030 today, and sat around for a bit. Eventually Jason came over as he had nothing to do either, and we played PS2 basically until 4 when he left and Gavin and I had to go to a meeting. Fight Night 2004 is an awesome game.  Anyways after Jason left and Gavin came, we got ready and then headed over to WLAC where we have our meeting today to discuss what our two churches are going to do. So we got there about a minute late, and then met up with Josh and then went to Pastor Graham's office. So we had a meeting until 440ish, which was really short, and then went to Angelo's for some early dinner, as me and Gavin were going to go to badminton right after eating.  So after eating and waiting for Josh's mom, me and Gavin then walked back to my house. Oh yeah I had my first panzerotti today haha. Anywho back on subject....  Got home, mom drove us to badminton, and then we played a lot of games. I'm too lazy to blog much more.  Now I will go.  Bye.
