But the biggest reason I'm so excited about summer is that I will get loads more time to spend with my girlfriend! :D Stephanie ^_^   Maybe I'll go to driving school and learn to drive, and maybe even get my provisional license, and then maybe even get a better (higher paying) job too. But until then, I'm quite content with walking(and running) to see my Stephy ^^ and to go everywhere else.  Incase you haven't noticed. Stephanie is everything to me! :D I love her so much! She makes me feel like the happiest person in the world! Even if I could only see her smile it would brighten up my day! :D There's a piece of her I carry with me! :D it's everywhere I go, everything I see ^_____^ When I sleep, I dream of her and it gets me by :D I can make believe she's here with me ^^ (does it explain why I like to fall asleep alot? lol)  Sure we have our problems, but we work it out and solve them ^^ and I couldn't be happier! :D She's the world to me! My only one ^^ I couldn't picture life without her ^^  "Here I go, scream my lungs out trying to get to you You are my only one I let go, there's just no one, no one like you You are my only, my only one" --Only One-- Yellowcard  Songs like that remind me of her! :D They make me appreciate how fortunate I am to have her ^_^ how lucky I am to be with her :]  I love you Stephy!
