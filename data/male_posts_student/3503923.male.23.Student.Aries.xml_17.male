His bulging hawk-like eyes were iced over and under the trimmed moustache his open mouth was packed with snow. Nikita, however, was still alive, though frost-bitten all over. When they woke him up Nikita was convinced that he was dead and that what was happening to him now was not in this world but in the next. When he heard the shouts of the peasants who were digging him out after heaving aside the stiffened body of Vasilii Andreich he was at first surprised that in the next world peasants shouted just as on earth, and that Vasilii Andreich's body was there too; but when he realized that he was still here in this world he was more sorry than pleased, especially when he became aware that the toes of both his feet were frost-bitten."  Tolstoy; Master and Man.
