The first is about Jeoffrey Hillman's company named Oragenics who has patented a "swab of bacteria that when wiped across a set of teeth will alegedly grant a lifetime of protection from tooth decay."  Hillman, a dental researcher at The University of Florida(go gators!) is testing the bacteria on volunteers. Supposedly you can just get the swab of bacteria, and the dentist will tell you to go home and eat a lot of sugar to help the bacteria colonize in your mouth. The bacteria the dentist will put into your mouth does not produce the lactic acid that eats the enamel off your teeth but instead carries an antibiotic that will kill the the lactic acid producing bacteria in a normal mouth. What all this should do is keep you cavity free for the rest of your life.  One side effect the reasearcher is looking into is 'Will the bacteria spread through a kiss?'.  Now in MY logic I think to myself "What is the problem with getting the bacteria in my mouth when it will keep me cavity free and save me a dentist fee?" I guess they care because they don't want the bacteria to get loose and then no one will have to go to the dentist to get it, they can just kiss someone. I guess for some reason they want a profit for all the hard work they put into enginering the bacteria. If the bacteria does not just jump from one person to another uncontrolably, the procedure should be public within 5 or 6 years. ____  The other article was about floating a 'fake star' above large cities so that the city dwellers can have somthing to look at in the light polluted sky. It is suppose to pulse at the rate of a relaxed person's heart to sooth and intermitedly it flashes green so people know it isn't a real star. ___  You can read about these articles at  urlLink http://www.Popsci.com
