They both are in WMV format(not my choice, it's "Windows Movie Maker") so you'll need the latest version of  urlLink Windows Media Player  to play it.  The first is a test of my movie making abilitites and is simply a slideshow with no content except to see cute pictures of 13 year old me, including one where it looks like I'm naked even though I'm not. The second is the gold.  For the very first time, Eric has created a thing of beauty. I have sculpted out of clay a true creation worthy of residence in the heavens. I have created a Yatta/Bible Black music video/tribute. Yes, love me for it. Note that I didn't bother syncing it, but instead of having Yatta play go on a black screen at the end, I have improvised with some amusing stalling techniques. Overall I'm really impressed with the sync, though it's awkward and slow at one part(you'll know it). It did cool/funny things I was NOT expecting it to. The only purposeful sync in the whole thing is the title screen.    The exciting birth of what I now call Bible Black 1. I've removed the links in this post, because they were extremely dead.
