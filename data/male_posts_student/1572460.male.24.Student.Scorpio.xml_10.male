Terminator) - Arnold Schwarzenegger in "Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines", released last week, and Part III in the "Terminator" movie series, which to me, revolutionized sci-fi flicks years ago; the first time in 1984 ("The Terminator"), and then the quite unforgettable Part II in 1991 ("Terminator 2: Judgement Day"). A lot has changed in these 20 years, EXCEPT for Arnold - the cyborg action hero, the man, the machine, the terminator.  A guy who wins hands down when it comes to delivering (or call it blurting out) these words with the most stone-faced of expressions you will ever see, and muscles taut to the extent that they make a cracking noise everytime he speaks (and make no mistake, it does not look ridiculous for Arnold, as it does for all those Akshay Kumars and Sunil Shettys). Wait, this is just the bonus package that comes along with (arguably) the best male physique on this planet. If God (or "Human Resistance" to put in James Cameron's words! :)) created Terminator in 2064 (or was it 2032?), it would be a reincarnation of Arnold himself, there is not even a hint of doubt. Arnold is not the one who simply physically towers above everybody else, but there is this amazing streak of ruthlessness and sheer dominance in the way he moves, the way he talks, the way he holds those seemingly toy rocket launchers in his iron hands, the way he puts on his goggles, the way he rides his other toys (read: all the Harley Davidsons, Sports cars, Vans/SUVs and Firetrucks), the way his CPU listens to commands and he in turn interprets them in words, the list goes on...and there's definitely a lot of "muscle" in all that he does (yeah, pun intended).   In contrast, the Terminatrix (a.k.a. T-X: Kristanna Loken) seems like a chick model in reality, only to be converted to an unstoppable mean machine on screen, albeit pretty successfully, I would say! Fortunately, the makers of Terminator have not done anything drastically different from the plot of the original Terminator movies, as opposed to "The Matrix Reloaded" folks who did helluva lot to increase the complexity of the plot and make die-hard viewers/fans spend sleepless nights pondering over mysterious "oracles", until perhaps Part III unravels the secret mystery in November 2003. :) Well, in reality, there are no comparisons to draw between the two movies; each is a great one to watch on the big screen on its own. But the truth is that Terminator is a pretty much no-nonsense movie, you do not need to apply your sci-fi skills or make your grey cells work harder. You do not need to worry about who wrote the "source code" and how, the gory details behind the emergence of the "matrix" and all those hard and soft(ware) abstracts, no matter how hunky-dory eventually they may be! Even better, perhaps, Terminator doesn't even have any out-of-the-world revolutionary visual effects if you compare it to its Part II predecessor. I know, nobody would have complained if they would have come up with better computer wizardry, but Terminator scores well in the sense that it does not stray away from the basic plot: Machines vs. Human Resistance, although in the practical sense of the movie, it's still a battle between - One highly sophisticated and potent machine Vs. Another, less sophisticated (but-who-cares!) machine. Terminator does not potray irrelevant and ludicrous emotional outbursts, unwarranted average-american love and sex scenes, and the run-of-the-mill action/violence, some of which unfortunately even the Reloaded guys could not resist to show in their Part II adventure. Neither is the movie stretched w.r.t the playing time, nor in terms of the overall storyline. The entire length of the movie has a nice consistent flow to it, its neat!  Agreed, any discerning eye will find a few glaring erroneous bugs in this movie too, one notably being the car/truck chase involving the Terminators, Mr. John Connor (Nick Stahl) and one Miss. Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). As much as you will get lost in this amazing chase (drive safely when you go home after the movie!), which can be second only to the freeway chase of Reloaded, (really, no room for comparisons again), it is mind boggling to see both Connor and Brewster escaping the T-X "unscathed" (Brewster's hair and skin is in flawless condition even after the most horrifying of rides you can experience sitting in the back of a rickety old truck!...atleast Connor is shown to be hobbling...they could have asked Brewster to do the same! :p;) ). But C'mon! Spare a thought...there is a lot more to this movie than just finding faults over this particular incident, and sci-fi flicks like these deserve to have some loop-holes!  I refrain from writing complete movie reviews. Yahoo, IMDB et al already do it for you, and they are good enough.    urlLink http://movies.yahoo.com/movies/feature/terminator.html   urlLink http://us.imdb.com/Title?0181852   But don't go by reviews if you are a Terminator fan. Don't even waste a moment; go and watch it on the big screen!  . . . .  And then, apart from a memorable trip to the Water World in Denver on the 4th of July, nothing special to mention about for now.  Let me get back to some research activities...;) Bientot!
