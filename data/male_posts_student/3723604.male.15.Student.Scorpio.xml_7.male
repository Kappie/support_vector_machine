I will use this weblog to chart my summer vacation at home, and I'll occasionally post when I get bored.   Today, I drew a robot: http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jdbrewer/untitled.bmp  Check it out.  First post! woop woop!  BTW- I'm aware of the issue that the labels on the robot CANNOT be seen. I can't fix this, please deal with it, and blame photobucket.com for sucking.  -reb
