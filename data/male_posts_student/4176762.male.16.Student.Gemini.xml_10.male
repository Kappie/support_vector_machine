Okay, instead of flippn back and forth between time Tarantino style, like the first draft I shall try to go in order.  Spiku came over after Alakai left.  Ahh crap, out of order.  Aliright, imagine I told you I got my hair cut short before i told you about the Spiku thing.  Yeah my hair is short now,  kinda creepy.  Anyway Spiku was over and we watched Pride and Predjudice cuz the book was soooo boring.  Then we sparred.  I tried out Olympic Taekwondo moves against his trying to remember what he read about different Kung Fu styles.  It was fun, a good workout.  There were people over for dinner, some family friends and a new guy my mom brought home.  He is nice, old, but nice.  The evening was uneventful, but then the clock stuck midnight. At that moment creativity hit Spiku and I like a bokken in the hands of Musashi.  We started spitting out ideas for a new script left and right, it was really cool.  Then my crimestopper friend had some problems with her blog so I helped out there.  I will put up a link when I can.  Anyways, after that all hell broke loose.  Crimestopper and I were bombarded with angry people IMing us, and then it kinda died down.  It was weird.  But I have recieved a death match Marvel vs. Capcom 2 from a Canadian.  Sounds interesting, no?  So thats all that happened in the AM of today.  For the rest of the day, after my five hours of sleep I plan to do nothing.  Cool, huh? No, I might play that Canadian and I have to go out for dinner tonite with my Taekwondo master and his family. Talk to everyone later.
