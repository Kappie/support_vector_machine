Apparently the permanent collection is impressive. Regardless, I never end up going.  I have not been sleeping well. The moment my head hits the pillow I seem to wake up. Midnight, last night, I was exhausted. I went to bed. I laid awake for an hour before giving up.  Meaning to go to the symphony and to museums may seem like a silly contrivance to appear  cultured . Do I want to do these things because I enjoy them or because I want to tell -- and impress -- people (and write about 'em on my blog)? To be honest, probably both.  So I was awake late last night. I didn't read my book because I was supposed to be reading a book for school but I don't like the book I'm reading for school so I  couldn't  read  my  book because I'd feel too guilty. It would have been cheating on the other book and I loathe infidelity. Though when school work is out of the way I do enjoy an open relationship with the three or four books I'm usually reading at one time.  So what did I do? Well, I had forgotten about the newest cd to fall into my filthy hands. I put on headphones, then put on the music. Then played some chess. The music I was listening to was frantic, dishevelled classical. The chess I played was online. Online chess. I play on Yahoo! Games. I got soundly thumped a few times. Frantic, dishevelled classical is my favourite kind of classical. It helps me be the tortured soul I've always longed to appear to be.  I read a book, for school, last week. It was filled with big words, so many big words, that I gave up looking them all up. Here are two words that followed each other in the book:  scrofulous excrescences . What the hell does that mean? I looked them up at the time but now I forget. Let me look them up again.   scrofulous:  morally corrupt  excrescence:  an ugly addition  Let's see if I can use them in a sentence.  The judge, a suspected Klan member, has never ruled in favour of a minority and is currently under investigation for his scrofulous behaviour.  and  The mouldy chesterfield proved an excrescence to the room.  I think I'd prefer to use more words to simply say what I mean rather than  obfuscate  obscure or confuse my meaning with words that less people understand.  I come across the word  verisimilitude  fairly often in my reading, yet for the life of me I can never remember what it means. I must have looked it up at least a dozen times.  While I was playing chess I was listening to the frantic, dishevelled violins, and thinking about going on a trip over Christmas with my drug money. Of course, I have never actually participated in a medical trial. A couple good sources have assured me that they are really very safe. I think I will probably go through with it. I can only go do it in September however -- I'll be too busy until then. So, I was getting thumped at chess, half-listening to the violins, and thinking about where I'd like to go. Then it occurred to me: Moscow.  It occured to me because I'm enrolled in an introductory Russian class this coming semester. Everyone I tell this to responds with an incredulous look and the mandatory question,  Why would you want to learn Russian?  To be honest, I'm not really sure. Ostensibly to read books in a language other than English. You would think I would just improve my French. I like the stereotypes of Russians though, much better than the French. Cold, unfeeling, (sexy, vampire-like) pale. The first Russian book I read I bought based solely on the title:  The Life of a Useless Man . The book was pretty good too. Russians know how to name things: War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, Dead Souls. Also: I like saying Russian city names: Volgograd, Novgorod, Tynda, Kursk, Sochi. Try it, say all those names out loud. It's fun.  Unfortunately the length of my Christmas break is a bit of a crap shoot. Last day of class is December 7. The exam period is from December 8 to December 23. Exam schedules get posted in early November, I think. Class begins again January 3. A plane ticket to Russia (according to  urlLink aircanada.com  at this very moment) runs nearly $2,000. That much money just to get there and back, I'd want to spend more than ten days. If I get the exam schedule I want I could potentially stay three and a half weeks.  Everything is moot. I will end up dropping my Russian class, not participating in medical trials, and will visit my grandparents in Ottawa for Christmas. I'll still suck at chess, and never go to the symphony or museums. I will never remember the meanings of the words I look up. And I will always have trouble sleeping.
