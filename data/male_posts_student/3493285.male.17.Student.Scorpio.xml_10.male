For instance, a wedding..a wedding is literally nothing. there are thousands of people married. and to those people, the bride the groom the friends the family, it is such a huge life changing event..it literally feels like the whole world such stop in its tracks and watch the wedding and be genuinely excited for the couple..and yet the world continues turning, not even giving a minute's notice to this huge even. do you read the obituaries? on occasion my mom and i sit down and read them..not to be morbid..but because we've both agreed that people should take time to give a moments thought to those who have passed on whether we know them or not. as i sit there and i read them, i do get some sense of sadness for the person and their family. but to those families, i cannot imagine the intense amount of grief they feel. and i barely even get a crumb of that. it's bizarre to me. although..i was reading my book (the 5 people you meet in heaven) and it talks about this..and i think that i really agree with it..that everybody is connected. that is why we are all so drawn to birth and to death..it is something that whether conciously or unconciously evokes some sense of emotion out of everybody. our bodies, our souls, our spirits, they know the deep lying roots of humanity, of our true purpose here. we   are    all connected..strangers are friends we have yet to meet (also a quote from the 5 people you meet in heaven).   i think thats it for now. i'm tired and am participating in a looooong run with a beautiful girl that i am so lucky to have in my life. the long run with the hot sun will all be worth it because she will be by my side. i love you miriam.  g'night, sleep tight, dont let the bed bugs bite (because they give you herpes)
