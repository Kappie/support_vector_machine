I had absolutely no idea. i liked molly at that time. when i told molly this the other day she told me about sam. who knew. and aria knew too because long ago she made a comment that i didnt get but now i understand. i think. yes.   what color will i die my hair today? not sure. ill hope i can actually go tho.          bad grade on spanish test came out of nowhere. i wouldve doen fine if i had read directions on one part. it might scare me into studying for final. but i doubt it. ill probably like barely look over stuff. god im so lazy.    trying a diet the month of june starting now. ive sucked so far. what ive eaten today:  -3 walnut chocolate chip cookies.  -half a sandwich -like 4 cherries -3 small cookies -juice -chocolate milk -a small circular sausage thing -tabasco cheezits  AHH FAT     lol   much love  peace  ~alex
