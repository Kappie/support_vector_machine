It rained. But that doesn't matter, cos it means that the plants will grow." *sings* And rain will make the flowers grow. It's a line from A Little Fall of Rain. Not that Sam knows that, in fact I'm sure she doesn't, being slightly too sensible to get into musicals like Scott and I. But yeah, I smirked. Smirkage.  Oh, Grade 8 is.... tomorrow ARGH ARGH ACK ARGH. N-e-r-v-o-u-s now. List of things YOU MUST DO and MUST NOT DO tomorrow...  MUST DO     Cross your middle finger over your index finger at 14:40   Carry a horse-shoe around   Find a 4-leaved clover   Wish me luck   Be supportive in a mental way, even though you're not with me. A few "come ons" would be nice, thankyou      MUST NOT DO     Cross fingers ON BOTH HANDS   Walk under a ladder   Let a black cat cross your path   Break your foot/arm/neck etc.   Forget what the time is at 2:40 PM   Have any kind of spilling or crashing accident   Step on the cracks in paving slabs, or the joins between slabs   Carry a pentagram. Come on, goths, you can do it for me   Sing anything by a band I don't like, because generally if I don't like them it's very bad luck to sing songs by them. My taste is final   Sing/Play With or Without You/Working Class Hero in the wrong key, or just wrong     *wishes self good luck* Love you all, will post again tomorrow. As the dying gibbon said, "goodbye."  Quote of the day: "In a sweet little village, remote and obscure, A beautiful maiden resided. As to whether or not her intentions were pure, Opinion is sharply divided."  From Noel Coward's   Alice is At It Again   Love, Jon Roskilly
