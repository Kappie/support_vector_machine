Over the weekend, my roof fell off. Well, no not really. Just some shingles came off. But still, that was some intense winds. On Friday when I was walking home I found out even though I was moving my legs, I wasn't making any progress. Plus I think I lost gallons of water out of my eyes. Fun fun. Hazleton is exciting. You never know what kind of weather you might get. One day it can be a blizzard with 10 ft of snow. Next day, bright and sunny. 90 degrees. Next day we get a hurricane. God I love Hazleton. End post.  Listen to H.I.M.
