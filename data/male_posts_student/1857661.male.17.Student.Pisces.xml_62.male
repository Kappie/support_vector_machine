Well, I went to my friend's place in Old Klang Road and his place reminded me of all the good times I had there. I could still remember the times when we played this computer game where we had to create our own pizza. It was cool. Then, I remembered the times when he taught me how to play basketball, playstation especially Dragonball where we challenged each other a lot when we were young, the times when he brought me out, chowed me things, etc. I had spent 40% of my precious childhood there.    Anyway, his family had now migrated to Perth, Australia. So, I don't see him that often since he went to England to futher his studies last year. Well, I still remember I used to go to his house and spend weeks there during holidays. Never mind, I guess this is the process of growing up.    Now back to today. Nothing much until evening. My family brought me to the Bon Odori Festival in Shah Alam. The journey was long and boring, but the festival was hot and sexy in a way that it rocks. When we entered the field, we were given a fan each. But, we actually took all the designs in the end. Haven't heard of the Bon Odori Festival? Here's a brief history taken from  urlLink http://mothra.rerf.or.jp/ENG/Hiroshima/Festivals/50.html .     July 15 (Lunar calendar), or August 15 (Solar calendar) is celebrated in Japan as "Bon" or Urabon, The Feast of Lanterns, especially by the Japanese Buddhists. It is said that during the year, on this day only, the iron pot in hell is opened for the deceased. Buddhist services are held at temples and private houses for ancestors, relatives and friends who died in the past, and particularly for those who passed away during the past year.  The particular feature of Obon is the offering of various foodstuff to the deceased, and of course all those who as emble for the service will partake of special food prepared for the day. This is because Obon originated in a Buddhist legend.  Obon used to be quite an important social event, and for attending the family Obon service, such persons engaged in works away from their native places invariably returned home. To factory and shop apprentices or household maids, Obon and January 15 were only two holidays in the whole year, when they were permitted to return home to their parents.  Eager to guide properly the spirits of ancestors on the day, it is customary to light lanterns at all houses. Some such lanterns were formerly very elaborate, especially made for the occasion. The most important feature of the service is the offering of food. Therefore to the ancestors are offered rice, vegetables, fruits, cakes, sweets and flowers. There are prepared special foods to be served to invited guests and friends. It is the spirit of giving food to fellow people that lies under this religious service. It is religious day, but also quite a ioyful social occasion.  In the Hiroshima area, colored paper lanterns are lighted at the ancestral graves. The white ones are for those who passed away during Aug. 16 of the previous year till Aug. 15 of this year.  "Toro-Nagashi" or lantern floating is the picturesque ending to the Obon service. To guide the ancestrial spirits back to the other world, littel floats are lighted with candles and floated down rivers or on the sea. People eagerly watch them float down the river or carried by the wind far away from the shore.  "Bon-Odori" or Bon dance, a religious folk dance, was originally given to comfort the spirit of the dead during the o-bon season. It is enjoyed by men, women, and even little children. It differs naturally according to locality, as each district has its own songs and styles of dancing. Recently many modern or even foreign songs and dances have been introduced to these programs. It is generally held in temple or shrine compounds sea or river shores or other convenient public places. A raised towerlike stand is erected and around the stand the people dance all night with the music.       Well, the food was delicious. I spent about RM40 there. Thank god my mom sponsored me. I tried the beer too. It was just like Carlsberg. But the fella told me that it's the most popular beer among the Japanese.    Here are all the pictures I took during the event!       My, myself and I!       With my sister!       With some Japs!       More Jap!       And more Japs!       All together, we took 16 fans!
