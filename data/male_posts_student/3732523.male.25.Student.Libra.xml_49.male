In today's episode, it is early Monday morning and I've just gotten out of the shower. As I am applying moisturizer to my skin I hear some strange sounds coming from the living room. I walk towards the sounds and immediately see Tigger sitting up on the ledge looking down at the front door. At what? I have no clue. Its obviously a cat thing.    I walk a bit further in and see that the cover is off one of the heating vents on the floor near the living room window. My first thought is "Crap, Pooh is in the vents!" so I walk over, remove the whole thing and start calling to her. I hear nothing. I'm wondering what to do and I consider getting the catnip as bait for her. I replace the cover for the vent because god knows Tigger would certainly climb in (he's done it before). I turn around and, to my surprise and amusement, there is Pooh outside at the back door meowing to get in.     I let her in but I'm a bit puzzled as to how she even got out there. As far as I'm aware, I don't think the vents lead outside - at least not that quickly/directly. The only other option I can think of is that she went through the living room window. See, we don't have a screen on that window just yet - and last night I left it slightly open so as to let in the cool night air. The thing is that it wasn't open any more than 3 inches but maybe thats enough. If she did escape that way she had quick the long drop down!    Cats are just weird.  Or maybe thats just our cats :)    Anyhoo, today I feel normal. And what I mean by that is that we went to a wedding this weekend and I got really nicely toasted - so I'm now feeling non-alcoholic and, thus, normal. Its been quite some time since I had that much wine - and it wasn't even all that much! I guess we've got to get into "condition" before Canadameet though! ;)    So now Adam and I are thinking of doing something for the long weekend in August - but we're not sure just what yet. Maybe camping? We might just go back to Sullivan Lake or maybe do something else. Suggestions anyone? It has to be something close to here as we're trying to save $$ to renovate our upstairs bathroom.    But now I must get ready for work... Ciao!
