But he did it.  Or at least started it.  He will find out later if he finished it.  But today was February 1st.  It didn't really mean much to him though.  Just that tomorrow is February 2nd and that Tuesday is February 3rd.  Both days will suck.  You friends need to make it not suck.  Come on, help a white brother out.  He is supposed to start presenting tomorrow in English and that is going to be terrible.  Absolutely bombing that probably.  Kinda like he did in the class.  He is needing to do something miraculous in there.  But his speech has no central topic or anything.  It is just rambling.  And not good ramblings like in this blog.  Just stupid stuff that isn't intelligient.  He is simply saying obvious things over and over.  But oh well, at least he can just get it over with soon.  And he is almost completely done with 1st semester.  Once grades come out he will be happy.  Sort of.  Hopefully nothing bad will happen.  But worrying is bad.  And too often people worry.  Tyke went over to Trew-fanator's with Skippy, Samantha, Macaroon, and Amed today.  Some of Trew-f's friends were there as well but Tyke isn't a friend of them so...But it was fun.  For the first half at least.  The half-time show sucked though.  It was funny though when Janet Jackson showed her right tit.  Yeah, that was weird live.  Tyke just thought it was staged and it wasn't real anyway.  However, upon getting home and checking out Fark he ended up getting told otherwise.  It was real and she had a tassle over the nipple or something.  But the half-time still sucked.  And MTV probably won't do another half-time show ever again.  Which might be a good thing.  Tyke should do a half-time show of his own.  Just him dancing and making faces.  And playing basketball.  And blogging, live.  Live blogging would be a sight indeed.  Maybe even him thinking about stuff.  That is interesting to him usually.  Not others but to him it is.  Well anyway, Tyke didn't see many commercials he really liked.  There was one though.  The one for Chevrolet which had the kids all with soap bars in their mouth.  And then at the end the kid sees the Chevy changing its top and yells out "Oh sh..."  That was a good commercial.  The first Chevy commercial sucked.  It was for the tiny Geo Metro-style car.  That thing is bitch ugly.  It is a freaking 4-door POS.  It should be shot.  And then they had 4 tall basketball players get in it (although they didn't actually show them getting in the car).  But it was terrible.  Why would anyone want to buy that car???  Who cares if it is less than 10K.  That is still an ugly ass car.  Yeesh, Tyke's car is probably faster than it too.  Man, he HATES that car.  Loathes it.               Tyke left Trew-f's house during the 3rd quarter and came home to do nothing.  He ate a bunch of candy and cookies and Gushers though.  Then he started on his speech while watching the SB.  He saw the end and was mad.  Stupid luck/blunder.  Well, then he watched Survivor All-Stars cuz there is a really hot chick on there.  And then he kept working and occasionally chatting online.  He also has become pretty proficient at blogging now.  Fast enough to get it done without much problem.  Nonetheless, he still takes close to 20 minutes probably.  But he has long toenails he just realized.  Oh well, Poppin Them Thangs is a good song.  So he will listen to it.  And he wants to sleep now.  He didn't sleep much on Sunday.  And was tired earlier in the day.  Damn stupid stuff.  Oh well, Fer Fer is gonna try and have a good day tomorrow.  No Tina in 1st period so he will be focusing on math.  Which has actually been a decent move.  He has still had fun.  Just for those of you that care the pic on his monitor is no longer there nor is the banner on his cell phone.  Should any of you know what those things are, you may be happy.  Or at least surprised.  Don't be surprised that Tyke finished the blog.  He always finishes.  Sometimes 2nd.
