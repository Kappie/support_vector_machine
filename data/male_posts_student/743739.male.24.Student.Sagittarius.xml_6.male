For now, all of my beautiful vibrant hair lies in a trash bag somewhere in Dallas.    Now, for those of you who are constantly looking fora reason to laugh at me (Martin, I'm looking at you and your group right now) I will post pictures as soon as I can, hopefully before leaving on vacation this coming Thursday.    Now to get serious. YFN was great. I consider it a great honor for God to allow me to see Him move twice in two weeks, and I pray that these experiences carry over into future youth meetings. I should probably type more than that, but I'm tired, so............. BUGGER OFF!!!!!
