I really don't care much about that, it was me denying a ride, and deciding to walk home that brought me real joy.  I rarely ever walk that way anymore, and it brought me great joy to see all sorts of views, and people along the way.  I was very happy as a result.  So at Chruch I had a little conundrum, to quote "Love and a bullet".  It ends up our church is now entering into a business partnership with a local carribean resturant.  Our church will be giving coupons for it, and the resturant would tithe, that is give 10% of their profits to the church.  This is bad because the church is getting involved with a business for a pure monetary purpose, but then again the good point is they are supporting a black buisiness in a logical partnership.  I don't know what to think of the entire situation, I guess that's what makes it a conundrum.  Even stranger, I was at Dunkin' Donuts and I heard this guy speaking in Arabic, and I understood him.  I was so happy, all my wasted hours let me understand a Middle Easterner saying "No, Praise God".  Oh well.
