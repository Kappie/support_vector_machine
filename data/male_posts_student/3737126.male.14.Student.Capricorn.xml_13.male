Anyway. It's Ms. Arboleda's b-day on the 14th, and our class better do something to get our chem teacher and our seats back (well, EJ DID mention that we could BRING SLEEPING BAGS!!! (EJ, hope you're reading this)  Another bummer is that: I don't have any close female friends. Master Lee better be happy at his condition...  Torpe kasi ako eh... When will I meet her???  so ends the entry here...
