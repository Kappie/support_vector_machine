Really I felt like I was reading his daily blog where he relates things to other things that only have like a single thing in common. Yet after that I think has the best explanation of XHTML and CSS. I started making a new version with XHTML and CSS. So far its is compatable with Opera, Firefox, Firebird, IE6, Safari, and Netscape(few glitches). Just click the link to your right to see it. Also Hotel California by Eagles( Live with Eric Clapton) is the song of the week. Anyways Bye Bye.
