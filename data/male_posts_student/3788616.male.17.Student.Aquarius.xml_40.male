However, overall, my life has been really great! heex... yup!  Ok lah, i think it's really evident why my whole life has been happier. Yup, it's really a singular reason. Ever since everything has been resolved, and since i made that decision to pick Cherie, my life has been really upbeat and i guess, i really am happy to make that choice. I don't regret it and i will NOT regret it!  Anyway, i realised though that even though, we've been going relatively smoothly, Cherie has been having some fears and doubts as to my feelings for her. I guess, i really can't say much to it lah, i guess, my past history is really working against me for it, but well... yeah, i am going to leave it to her to believe whatever she wants to believe. Won't make a special effort to make her believe cause all i can say is that, what you see is what you get.  Yup! hmm... i don't know, been really worried about it all the time lah. It has been a persistent problem to me and hindering the process of all my relationships... but oh well, i can't really do anything about it right? Can i? Either that or i simply give up on everything lah... however, i really do not want to do it, cause i guess, she really has come to mean a great deal to me and i can't afford to lose her... But, yet again, i am leaving it to her lah.  Ok, i should stop being an ass and just start working lah! i have been slacking lah! Wah lau! If this goes on ah, i will die for promos! I really better start working hard! heex... anyway, Cherie, i am not going to say much as to with regards to our situation but i really want you to know that i am being true to you and i really hope that you would trust me in this... cause...  i really... Like YOU alot... in fact, more than anything than i can say lah... ok... this is so embarrassing... *blushing* But yeah, i guess, i never am going to regret making this choice as you've made my life more meaningful as compared to before, so yeah... I... Love... You...  ok, i so am not going to do that ever again lah... but yeah, just had to say all of these now before i live to regret it... heex... Everyone else! Smile and take care! Live Life To The Fullest! :p
