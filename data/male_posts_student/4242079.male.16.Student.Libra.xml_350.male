I feel like complete shit today. I can't really say why, I only had one drink last night, and was in bed by midnight, as well.  I've been listening to a lot of Ani DiFranco and Alison Krausse lately, a lot of mellow stuff. Seems to fit the mood of the day. The other night I just sat on my bed, playing with my slinky (get your mind out of the gutter), and thinking, for about an hour an a half, before finally falling asleep with the light on.    someday, some morning, sometime
