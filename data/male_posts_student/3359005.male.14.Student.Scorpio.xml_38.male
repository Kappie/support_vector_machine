Some blogs have been singled out as good and popular; some of which actually mean something, some of which don't. Today I was unfortunate enough to chance upon one that was a diary of a tormented and life of pure idiocrasy.  If you are bored and want to take a look into the blog, here's the address(http://xiaxue.blogspot.com). I don't know what so special about her blog, cause all I see is daily routine and well, Singapore propaganda. Oh yeah... There's it's own bit of vulgarity as well. At least here I'm refined enough to learn how to control my anger when there's nothing but a blank screen staring at me. How can any proper lady get so crude without any provoking factor? Maybe, in her definition, a "Singapore Lady."  Here it's entirely different isn't it? I hate Singapore, I bash Singapore, only because unlike her, I am a highly intelligent person who has prospects outside of Singapore. What's even worse is that she actually generalised people "Coming from English-speaking girl and boy schools like ACS or MGS" as those who traditionally quit the country for better opportunities. I don't know what's her bloody problem, probably that she was never smart enough to get into these English speaking schools. She obviously can't see that people in these, by the way top schools, have enough foresight to recognise that honest and long-term success cannot be obtained by those who stay illogically loyal to their country.  From my point of view, even my dog makes more sense than her. I'm just hoping that this extreme will, like her blog, attract the masses, the intellectual masses...
