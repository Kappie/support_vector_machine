Apparently I told somebody to read my blog yesterday, I don't remember doing it though, I doubted she'd like it anyways cause it talks about girls that I've liked/dated, yea, you know what it talks about if you've read it and if not get off your lazy ass and do it then to know. So yea, now she is mad at me, is there a record for most girls that hate you at once? I could be going for a record here even and not know it! Well yea.. Things should blow over soon between us two. She's another girl dating somebody and likes me, or did... I'm starting to think there is a conspiracy? Maybe there is like a sign above my head I can never read that says something like 'Play tricks and cruel games on me!' cause I don't see how in any freaking way I am 'cute' or whatever the hell they say, I'm thinking they need therapy really. While I'm on the topic I should say what people think I look like I guess?  My best friend [since kindergarten, long time huh?]: Larry Byrd [Bird?], that basketball player from who knows how long ago. He and his brother said it a long time ago, like 3 or 4th grade to me, lol, still sticks in my mind, ish funny really.  Parents, Family: They think somehow I look like Harry Potter. For one, I have brown hair, and brown [mostly brown] eyes. I'm not English either so shouldn't this kill their thought of it? Nope, not at all, it doesn't kill the thought for them that Harry Potter is a fictional character which is described in books, no visual pictures anywhere less you mean the Harry Potter from the movies? Yea, right.. I look like -him-? *Falls over laughing.*   O!!!! Good song just came on the Radio, and anybody that lives near GP, Medford, RR, Roseburg, and some other areas MUST listen to KROG! 96.9 GP 97.1 everywhere else near here. But yea, it is a really good station and this song is really good. 'Can you hear the dolphin's cry'. Parents think that KROG is a bad station, cause some of the DJs are not the sharpest crayon in a box of pencils. Otherwise they like most of the music, except for those with 'explicit' lyrics, like Damn, crap, fuck, shit, bitch. Those yea, lol. I wanna have some fun so most people will want to jump over this little part... Damn - Holds water back, man-made. Somebody stuck on a 'N' cause they passed kindergarten with a F-. Crap - People do that, animals do that too. Cycle of life, like sex. Grow up people. Fuck - Speaking of sex, another name for it. Shit - What happens when you crap. Bitch - a female canine. A few words that somebody said and nobody remembers who did but is still good advice: If you have to use a four letter word maybe you aren't ready for life? ...Wait... That wasn't how it went. O well. Not many of the songs have 'explicit' lyrics on the station though they have quite a few drug references in the commercials and some of the DJs do likewise, like at 4:20 they have Bob Marley songs play. O well, I'm either at work or I'm not listening to the radio at that time so it doesn't matter.  I'm running out of things to say... I still haven't got a comment about how anybody thinks the blog looks so I'm wondering if anybody ever visits... I think I'll put on a counter, right by my Yahoo thing and add a few other things for the hell of it and fill that space some. Ciao.  ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~ ~~ Brian H.
