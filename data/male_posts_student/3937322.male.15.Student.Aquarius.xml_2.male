It sucks, I know, always playing tricks on you. Just yesterday, it was very bitter to know that LRT trains do play tricks on you. I thought I had arrived at my destination earlier than another train, but then it turned out that the other train was faster, even though it took the longer loop.   For the past 3 hours, I have been frustrated by this stupid mosquito that might have taken a few hundreds of ML of my blood now. Sigh, but then I just located it and wiped the life outta it with my hands. Another small victory for me, perhaps, in another passsing day. As you can see, its already 2.30 am in the morning. Dunno whether will sleep in class tomorrow?  I was actually invited to this sorta gathering to actually "celebrate" the staying of a primary school classmate as she came back from China for only a month (till Aug). But then, I acutally rejected it. Can't believe it myself. Was I too apathetic? Or was it due to the fact that there were not many guys around there (most are gals)? Dunno, but I do not like to be stuck in awkward situations. Makes me feel extremely uncomfortable.  Tomorrow is going to be another hectic day. First, I think that I need to hand in my complete Chemistry Project by tomorrow, by hook or by crook. And in the afternoon I have to collect NPCC uniform parts at Police Academy and that means that I have to miss another Computer Science Club training again since last term. Sigh, if not for my heavily peeled-off boots and short trousers, maybe I would even consider giving the trip a miss as in CSC now is the chance for us to teach the Sec 1s somethings before the handover of leadership.  That's all, folks! If you did read this and still have time, why not visit  urlLink http://www.aatraders.com/readblog.php?player_id=549 , another of my blog, although you may have to play that game to understand some of the lingo.  Cyclone swirling away...
