Ever since he developed the persona as a arrogant stock market financialist, I have hated him. Recently on tour of Germany, Layfield did a "Heil Hitler" salute in the middle of the ring to rile up the fans. You have to be the biggest moron in the history of the world to do something that low-class. Who cares if that makes the fans hate you even more? What about the people who lived through things like that? Oh well, WWE doesn't care. They'll probably have him beat up a homeless person next week. Whatever. At least justice was served when CNBC fired Layfield from their network. You know what's funny though? At one point, I thought of Layfield as one of my favorites. I loved watching him wrestle with Ron "Faarooq" Simmons as the A.P.A. (Acolyte Protection Agency). Sadly WWE broke the team up. Maybe Layfield will go back to being a "beer drinking bad ass". I can dream, can't I?  I feel like playing The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for some reason. Oh well, see you later!    Song of the Moment:   The Cure - Love Song
