I just threw out some junk mail and random papers. I also straighted up my stacks of papers and books. I'll have to check out the vacuum cleaner later.  I'm also getting laundry done.   I'm going to have to go to campus to run some quick errands too such as get stamps....  Yay going to D.C. tomorrow!  ***
