I'm hoping down the road we could get some nice informative stuff up like how to do flash. So your probably wondering how can you help get this site started. Here a handy-dandy list:    Join the Webring  Comment on Stuff  Submit a Tutorial  Tell Your Friends  Visit the Site  Move to Allentown (No wait, don't do that. You'll regret it.)   Um, yeah. That's about it. If you have any ideas about the site just let me know. Right now it's a blog but soon to be much, much more. Sit back and enjoy the ride.
