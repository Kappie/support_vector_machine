My life now consists of daily workouts, family time, and the occasional get together with friends. I think I'm beginning to settle back in after my bein gone for 10 months. I am beginning to realize that my life here is a little different than mine in Brazil, but that's to be expected hey. You try it though it's not as easy as it sounds. The emotional turmoil of being an exchange student is enough to drive an average teenager crazy. The only way most of us make it through is with the help of our friends and family. I don't speak of the families we left behind, but of those we find there. Everyone deals with it in their own way. There's drinkin, partying, praying, and the occasional crying. I found a good combination of all four works best. I made it though and I return with stories to tell my grand kids and some I wouldn't tell some of those closest to my heart. I think the only part worse than actually going to Brazil was coming back. Going at least you didn't know what would be coming at you, but returning is a whole different story in that you know what's coming, but even then there are surprises. I guess it all comes as a package deal though and I wouldn't trade it in for the world.
