US soccer.  it got huge in 94 when the men's team did fairly well... but died back down.  same with women's soccer... all hyped up for the world cup... then not much of a splash otherwise.  i guess i just don't see hockey as a sport that will take hold in warmer climates.  you can still be outside playing football in february weather with shorts on in florida if you wanted (well... us buffalo kids could at least).  not only are there climate barriers to establishing a healthy market... but hockey is thus far an expensive sport.  equipment for a defensemen or offensemen can easily start out around $500 a player... and for goalies?  forget it.  see... it makes sense for us northerners to invest... since winter's long... it's the only other team sport besides basketball that's going on.  elsewhere in the south, you're still playing outside... you still have a multitude of choices on what you want to do with your time.  eh... so in conclusion... fine... the cup goes south to a new market.  hopefully it won't be for nothing... hopefully there won't be a letdown like what happened with the florida panthers... but jeez... couldn't it have been a little further north?  carolina?  even atlanta... i would've accepted that... at least they used to have a team in the nhl before the thrashers.  so i got an email from straphangers which is a nypirg awhile back.  they are in the process if they haven't already of attempting to restrict camera use in the subways (flat out banning it).  the subway experience is a rite of passage for any newcomer or tourist.  you SHOULD be able to take pictures for yourself, family, whomever.  on top of that... there are so many interesting things to take pictures of while you're underground.  some of the ads that've been drawn and written over depicting new movies coming out etc are totally classy and classic.  i remember this one on where it was promoting the movie blue crush in the lorimer station on the L line.  someone drew a penis and scrotum coming out of the bikini... the blonde haired girl was missing teef and her eyes were all messed up.  some dialogue was written on it... i've forgotten what it said... but all i can remember is looking at the picture and cracking up... wishing i had brought my camera.  anyways... here's the email i got... join the pirg if you want and live in nyc... tell the mta you understand they're trying to make things safe... but you don't want to be in complete lockdown everywhere you go (which is where it seems we are headed patriot act version 2 anyone?).   Dear rider:   The MTA is now accepting comments on its proposal to ban photographs, film and video in the subway and bus system.  We strongly urge you to express your views by commenting at:  http://www.mta.info/nyct/rules/proposed.htm (The option for sending an e-mail to the MTA can be found at the bottom of the MTA's description of its proposals.  Don't be discouraged by the MTA's confusing e-mail form.)   For information and arguments against the ban, you can visit: http://www.straphangers.org/photoban/  ============================== NYPIRG Straphangers Campaign One Click to a Better Commute - http://www.straphangers.org obviously he would say  urlLink this .  he's the head of a multinational energy company dependent on non renewable energy sources as his profit.  can you imagine what would happen if the solar economy had an advance and developed overnight?  there would be no way to transition a company like exxon-mobil.  they're too big and they've invested too much in their infrastructure.  think of all the billions of dollars they've spent on industrial equipment and distribution network!  energy independence will need to be reached at some point if we're going to continue to use fossil fuels as our main energy source.  fossil fuels will run out... then what?  we might as well start now... and i think we should concentrate on it a lot more than we are... trying to develop more efficient ways of using renewable energy.  the quicker we find something that works... the less oil we will use and the less environmental damage we will cause.  that has to be worth far more than any pain we incur in the short term.  it's sad that the cost of higher education is getting more  urlLink expensive .  now with the economy still down from it's late 90's peak (yes a couple thousand jobs were created recently... but remember how bush went out to reclassify mcdonalds jobs as manufacturing jobs?  we can't solely rely on numbers as they're almost always skewed to benefit the administration that releases those statistics) states are cutting their education budgets putting more of a burden on students.  i've always felt that education is one of the only places where your race and your background don't define you... well... it's turning out to be less and less true.  if things progress as they are now, higher education will be out of reach for many people if they aren't already.  pretty sad for a country that is supposedly the "land of opportunity".  education has always been the easiest way for anyone to get ahead.  if you know more than the next person you're hired for a job.  that's how it usually goes at least.  whether you experience discrimination in the job place is a different issue... but during your time in school... once you get into a school... i would argue that anything other than school work is not a determining factor in how you do... thus i think it's an equal playing field for all.  it would be a shame if in the future we have less tremendously bright students limited in how they can pay for education to be the factor that keeps them out of a college or university.  as with individuals... having a population that is educated is the easiest way of keeping our own country in good shape.  it may be our only defense when china really comes online and its economy wakes up when it leverages it's 2 billion plus people.  so... the point is... education... important... we must make it more accessible instead of making it prohibitive.  and here's some  urlLink funny  (also ridiculous you decide what proportion it is to you).  what's this with renaming all the airports?  the OC?  what the hell is that?  i mean... i thought the george bush intercontinental airport, and ronald reagan national airport was bad (reagan was a charming guy and all... i'd have loved to have had him as a grandad or something... but i thought his economic policy, defense spending, and budget control were terrible!  i mean... it took us 3 presidential terms after he left to get out of the hole we were in... and since have gotten back in thanks to dubya).  now seeing how airports are just being renamed for people that haven't done phenomenal things... naming an airport after a stupid tv show is just well... stupid!  can you see why other countries laugh at us?  see how ridiculous we are?  for an elected official to even bring it up?  it just makes me mad... and that's a problem for me... cause i feel like dark helmet in spaceballs... but instead of being surrounded by a-holes... i feel like i'm surrounded by dumbasses.  being mad isn't healthy... so they say... and i get mad everyday multiple times... i'll probably have a heart attack and die when i'm 30... i'll just get so mad i'll spontaeneously combust from the anger at stupidity inside of me.  ever watch lewis black?  i think that's going to be me when i'm older!  i've also been visiting this  urlLink site  which i've heard about but recently visited.  it's pretty damn cool (content AND style wise).  here's something he  urlLink published  about the death of the q diamond train in new york.  i wish i was there... it sounded fun.  if it was only a week later on my bday... i could've made a trip for the weekend.  reading the site and short fiction stories posted made me think back to stories that i told so i wrote a one drawing from my own format.  you ever notice that when you first become close/attracted to a girl and you're younger (though it still might happen when you're older but it's less frequent i think)... your friendship/relationship develops to the point where they want you to tell them a story?  of course you oblige and try and be cute about it cause you wanna get action or continue playing the game or whatever.  well... it's happend on a couple occasions... and you start out with "once upon a time there was a boy and a girl..."  well most of my friends will tell you that i like messing with people... not because i'm mean... but mostly to see their reactions to things said or done.  anyways... my stories would always follow a certain format... mostly as a joke and to see if the person was paying attention and throw them off a bit.  i guess i'll post it below this post so you get the explanation first before you read the story... it might make more sense with an explanation of what i find funny than if you'd just read the story (maybe not).  the thing that happens at the end... would always happen at the end of all my stories.  the details given in the beginning are crucial to draw the person in... make them connect somehow... i'll leave it at that.  g'night!
