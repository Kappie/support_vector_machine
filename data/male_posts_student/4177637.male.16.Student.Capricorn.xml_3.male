Second day, though, I stayed up roughly the same time - doing again, Pre-Cal and Statistics. Guess I shouldn't have been surprised that I got a crapload to do this weekend as well.  The usual enthusiasm that normally comes during the first week of school was basically non-existent for me. After going to Taiwan and Japan over the summer, going back to school to see my fellow classmates - most of them having grown dumber over the summer (which I didn't think was possible) - really didn't seem to hit the spot. And besides the massive homework attacks, nothing eventful has occurred as of yet. Unless you count Ms. I. Johnson's grammar assessment that raped me today:  "What is a complement and list and describe the different kinds" Uhh... 10?  To top off my wonderful week, my internet's become really slow for some strange reason. Swell.
