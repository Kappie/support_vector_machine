I will not read anything that requires any thought for the next 30 days.     last night I went to  urlLink dali  with  urlLink lauren ,  urlLink liz , and  urlLink matt .  it was  yummy.  we had goat cheese and rabbitt and quail and some other cheese things and some gross artichoke hearts and this other cheese thing and some sangria and some handmade chocolates for dessert.
