Watch the blossoming of new life at the Live Pupae house, where young butterflies will spread their wings for the very first time. Meanwhile, up to 3,000 species of the world’s most beautiful and rare insects can be found at the Insect Kingdom, which includes a dazzling enclosure of over 5,000 fireflies. Be sure to stop and admire the largest Dynastes Hercules beetle ever recorded – all 160mm of it!  Taken from-http://www.sentosa.com.sg/explore_sentosa/explore_butterfly.htm
