I ate noodles at 12 something, and ate while blogging. After blogging and lunch, I set out to print my blog's October entries. It took me about an hour till 3 something. I am printing November and December's entries tomorrow. Yeah.   After surfing the net for an hour, I soon fell asleep. I just dozed off like that. Oh boy...I was sure tired. I slept and slept till 6 something, when Father woke me up to go to eat. I asked him to buy back dinner, and I continued sleeping till he came home.    I ate char siew rice watched TV and bathed. Here I am, online blogging.  Sigh. I forgot to mention that during the car trip back and today, there are several moments when I suddenly went into a shock. Ya. I was shocked that I am coming back to/back in Singapore. I should be in Malaysia. You are saying that I am regretting my decision? No, I am not regretting. I stick to my desicion, I believe in it. I did not regret coming back home.  I also forgot to add that CQ was a really great friend. He defended me a lot when the others bullied me, he made me feel part of the group when they didn't. I value CQ as a great friend. I am gonna treasure him.  Ya know. All I wanted was to be accepted. To be part of a group. To have fun with my friends. However, I just failed miserably in every attempt. Why? Am I such a detestable person that no-one wants to accept me? I am such a failure.   Wendy said I am a "bully-magnet". I can be bullied easily, that's why the jokes can't seem to stop. Bullied easily? Yeah...I rarely does strike back, I just tolerated and bear with it. I just hope for these 'jokes' to stop sometime after, but they never do. What to do?   God... I think I better stop now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
