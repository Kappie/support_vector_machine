"I'm watching a film" was her reply. But it was fun. Both Mattius and Lesley hit the 50mph mark!!!! And I reversed into a ditch! But in all fairness I had to in order to turn around. I also got a courier badge and two white chocolate cookies out of it. Also smacked in the chest, arm and face by a rather springy green sphere! I think that is all for now. Any comments feel free to post.  Check ya later. And stay safe. String Out!
