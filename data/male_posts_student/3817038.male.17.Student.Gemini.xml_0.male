Well, the girlsies wanted to go to lunch... i wanted to say goodbye to my people online, but these girls, being very nosy, clambored around the computer to see the messages i was sending. i had to take off without saying anything, which might have bummed a few people out.  i took the girls to Macaroni Grill and i had a pepperoni calzonetta which wasn't too spectacular.  then we played hangman on their paper mats there.  it was movie-themed - i would have totally dominated with "How Stella Got Her Groove Back" but we ran out of time.  oh well... i dropped them off at the mall and headed home.  when i got there i realized it was 3:05 and i was late to piano.  I had totally missed it the day before so i didn't want to get in trouble again.  i called the teacher told her i was running late cause of those girls and hightailed it over to the lessson... on the say i called Serra and apologized for ditching her online again (those dman girls!) i just hope she got the message....   ... yeah, so now i'm sitting here waiting for the girls to call and have me pick them up.   Peace out for now :)
