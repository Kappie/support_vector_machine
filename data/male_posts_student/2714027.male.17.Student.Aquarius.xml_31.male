Ambrose, the guy who wrote  Band of Brothers . I spend almost all of today at work, which also happened to be the easiest day at work  ever . I spent 7 whole hours just painting stuff and watching it dry, being paid £4.10 and hour to do just that. Just under £30 to paint stuff - not too bad I guess. Tomorrow I'll probably have some homework I've forgotten about creep up on me and send me into a slight panic or something similar. Something to really look forward to is my first driving lesson on Monday - watch out Schumacher!
