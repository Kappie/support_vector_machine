I had to stay at home and wait for the french student to arrive at my house and to welcome him. I waited a whole day not knowing when exactly he would arrive at my house and so i wasted a whole day when i could have gone out and watched a movie. That's ok though, i guess... what really annoys me is this weekend was the one weekend where my parents wanted to go to the snow, and that could possibly mean taking my sister and my parents, which in turn could mean i would be home alone free to do whatever, free to have whoever come over, but noo.... -.- I am in my current state of mind annoyed, but i must say i was errr well i wasn't so sure i wanted to meet the French student because well Iv never had a french student stay at my house before -.-. Anyway the French student seems, "sympa" as he said to me or, "nice" and well he does seem quite nice, but it appears his friend doesn't like chinese people. This i gathered after his friend asked of me to stand in front of the webcam his initial reaction i would have no idea what he said, it was way too slang, but he eventually got around to saying j'aime pas chintook. This i would take as being i dont like chinese but then again i don't like those ppl who stereotype 0.0 damn stereotypers -.-
