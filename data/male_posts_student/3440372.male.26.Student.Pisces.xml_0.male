They really don't like to see us leave. The correct response should be "am I going to die if I go home?"  If the answer to this is no, which it invariably is, leave. And I can't stress this enough. Leave as soon as you're able. Just run. If you can't run, get a wheelchair and healthy friend and make a break for it. It is a well-known fact that the chances of catching an infection are massively reduced once you the leave hospital.    I think I should take a minute here to explain that I have nothing against doctors or nurses, they do a wonderful job often for very little money and extremely long hours. I am Not entirely sure I could do their job. In fact, I'm sure I couldn't. Just wanted to clear that up.    If the running doesn't work or you can't find a healthy friend to help you (some friends can extremely squeamish about breaking a sick friend out of hospital, can't for the life of me work out why) then don't be afraid to cry, beg, cajole, threaten, bother, bribe, steal, harass, harangue, castigate, abuse, question a persons parentage, inquire whether the doctor has webbed feet, set fire to everybody's shoelaces, undo all the wheelnuts on everybody's wheelchairs, masturbate into the bed managers face cream (this may be difficult if you have a catheter), have sex with a melon in the middle of the ward, drink at all of the Lucozade on the ward and sing rule Britannia at the top of your voice until the sugar rush wears off, refuse to answer to anything other than Sir Snooty Monkey-Bottom the third (unless this is your real name, for which I am truly sorry, you will obviously need to think of another name) and if all else fails pretend to be dead. This way, when they take you to the morgue it will be a little easier to escape.  So there it is, 26 years of going to the hospital with alarming frequency has resulted in these 'ere pearls of wisdom. Use them wisely my friends. And remember, if you try any of these methods   You Will Look like a Twat  . But it is much easier and a little comfier to apologise when you are at home. And I always find focusing on leaving hospital with such intensity means the reason you are there becomes secondary and a little easier to deal with.  :: Nods Sagely and Ponders a Career in Motivational Speaking ::
