Glad that Ang Cai wanted to start this blog...And that he wants to try to gel people together....It will be great if people got to know each other better...  Well, as for me, I'm not an NTU person...But thanks to knowing the owner of the blog, some of us get special privileges and we are allowed on it... =)  Study hard when school re-opens and get good results. And don't ever be like me, be mad enough to take another course now....Currently dying with the studies and work at the same time now.... =P  See you all in church this Sunday.... =)
