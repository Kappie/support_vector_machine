Skippy and Mandy basically had sex and Tyke had some fun of his own with Lisa Lovey.  Tyke also made up a new game called Musical Laps.  The premise of the game is quite similar to the game Musical Chairs.  However, one sex is sitting down and acting as the chairs.  The music starts and the opposite sex walks around the circle and when the music stops the walkers have to stop and sit on the sitter's lap and then the sitter has to guess who it is.  The winners advance to the next round and the winners win.  Ask Tyke if you don't understand the game.
