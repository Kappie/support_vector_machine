Until then, here's what I wrote yesterday for a California Dem group I'm part of, which discusses the liberal/conservative divide in our country. It should make sense, despite the other views not being posted:      I don't think you can separate Americans' perception of themselves as either conservative or liberal from the culture-clash that created the current definitions. Ronald Reagan was the one who so thoroughly stigmatized the word "liberal," as a reaction to the 60's counter-culture. Before that, liberal largely meant supporters of so-called New Deal-type "welfare state" policies (as opposed to Reagan's corporate welfare) -- although I've seen speeches going back to Kennedy and Truman that talk about the liberal/conservative divide, and the underlying themes sound as if they could've been written yesterday. As a result of Reagan, though, liberal is now mostly taken to mean the difference between being "grown-up" and "hippy-dippy," despite that being a flawed and unfair characterization, and the fact that the reverse is closer to being true.     But Reagan was able to get inside the skin of Democrats and dissect them extremely effectively, because he WAS one until about the age of 40...and there's no zealot like a convert. The same way that journalists today (and for the last twenty years) -- despite the majority of them being liberal -- are far harsher on their own kind. First, as a result of trying to be fair and taking it too far. Second, as a result of the sh*tty essence of human nature, "me too-ism," and how incredibly fun it is to tear people down. Third, the fact that most of them suck at their job, and have as much insight into human nature as my dead pet gerbil. Finally, because members of "The Fourth Estate" have reduced themselves to being sensationalistic purveyors of garbage, with an "if it bleeds, it leads" mentality, and a need to make things bleed if they aren't currently doing so. Oh, and because most of them suck at their job, if I haven't mentioned it. Along with their being spineless worms.   That phenomenon (with the exception of sucking at their job, and perhaps being spineless worms) is largely shared by the public. Finding the worst in people is like a drug, and the country is addicted. It's as a result of all this, I would argue, that only 18% of Americans call themselves liberal, despite their stance on policy issues. Even during the hey-day of Clinton bashing, I never felt that the media branch of the vast right-wing conspiracy -- at least the ever-dwindling "objective" part of it -- was acting in a conscious effort to serve as the GOP's lapdog. Rather, being the GOP's lapdog was a result of being slaves to sensationalism, of having all the insight of a rotting shoe, and most especially, of really, really sucking at their job. (Along with being spineless worms, as I may have mentioned.)    But as the band Smashmouth said regarding the 60's cultural revolution (which had a long hangover period, convincing many of us that the spirit that tried to squash it was gone forever): "This is a love attack, I know went out but it's back. It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact."     The Reagan Revolution was what caused the love attack to retract, like George Costanza's what's-it after a cold swim. But it's back, or on the verge of being back, just as the song suggests. And this time, when we win, it will be here to stay.     In order to defeat the competing mindset, though, and successfully usher in the new (previous) age, I don't think it's a question of politics, but a question of culture. To the extent that politics can effect the culture (which I think is minimal, if relying on caucuses, congresses, or Kucinichs), then the route you describe could be effective. But with most of the people I know -- outside of those I know from political circles, who are the exception, not the rule -- revamping the intra-party dealings of the Democratic Party is just not the way to reach those who need reaching. It needs to be something far more superficial, and pleasing to the eye. As Otter from Animal House said: "this situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody's part."     I mean that facetiously, of course, but in the same spirit as he did, which is to think in all new terms...and I think the Dems have spent the last two years doing that. In short, I believe we have already done what some are suggesting needs doing. The party HAS remade itself, spurred by the catalyst of the Iraq war debate, and it has taken the culture right along with it. Air America and the Daily Show are doing what Dennis Kucinich and Ralphie "the Nad" Nader never could. In my view, the conservative/centrist/progressive debate within the party has pretty much run its course. That's the argument we've been having for the last thirty years, not the one we need to have going forward. The whistle has blown, and the DLC-type Democrats have finished ahead of the far left-wing, if one insists on judging it that way. (Which I don't.) At some point the question becomes whether or not the left wants to accept that, because there's nothing in the cards that is going to radically change the views of the majority of Americans in the years ahead.     All that needs to be accomplished now is coming together to defeat George Bush in the fall. After that, if people of any political persuasion within the party can't find a receptive atmosphere for their views -- or can't find the words to express them, or sway the views of others -- then maybe we should just part ways and do our own thing. I think the Democratic Party has remade itself, though, and I for one am extremely pleased with the result. If those same groups want to fracture before the election, and thereby torpedo both of our futures (which I'm not suggesting anyone here is doing), that's okay with me, too. As I've said before, suffering is good for the soul. We're almost home, though. And I'd love for us to make it there together...
