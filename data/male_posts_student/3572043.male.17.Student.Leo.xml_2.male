Magicked Skull, from ghoulO_O; Ghouls can own me easily... If alone... But, with a balanced party with players ranging from lvl 14-16, we can own a Ghoul easily! Gonna get the Skull and lvl to 18 within this week! Getting a support job and there i go killing and stuff! I should monk support job... Zengar out.
