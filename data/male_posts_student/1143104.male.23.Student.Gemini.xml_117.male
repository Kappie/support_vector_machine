Patti and I were looking for a name for the blog and wanted something that would reflect who we are but also be somthing "home related". After chatting about random phrases, expressions, and word play, I suggested something musical. Namely, something from the realm of Metallica! I sifted through titles and lyrics, but there was one obvious choice: Welcome Home (Sanitarium). For those of you playing along at home, you can find this musical masterpiece on track four of their third album release "Master of Puppets" ( Lyrics ). Patti and I are both certifiably nuts, but we're both Metallica-loving homeowners so the song works!
