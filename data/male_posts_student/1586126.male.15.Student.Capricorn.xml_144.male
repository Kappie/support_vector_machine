YAY  so um, yesterday it was pretty boring cuz uhm i didnt do a thing i just spent the day with my parents and took lots of pictures hehe. if you see the pictures, my dad isnt drunk hehe.   i wanted to go to mcdonalds on new years eve and take pictures and act stupid, but my parents didnt wanna go so we didnt go duh.  uhm  i got a CD!
