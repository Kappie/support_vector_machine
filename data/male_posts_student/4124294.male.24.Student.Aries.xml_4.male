Finally able to get back online, after a confusing screw-up with my ADSL provider... it's a long story, something to do with a muck-up in their computer which made them think I hadn't paid my previous bill even though I actually  had.  Had to call them and naturally wait for hours for them to finally patch me through to a consultant... stupid sales and services technicians, they're all the same,  all  of them! Grr! Arrgh! No offence to those who work in this line. Grr!  Anyway, over the weekend I joined my church group (yes, I'm part of a church group) on a retreat to a "hideaway" somewhere east of Perth. It was pretty fun, driving over an hour to this deserted little place smack in the middle of a hilly forest, where temperatures dropped to chilling 0.4 degrees at night (which made for some really uncomfortable sleeping moments, let me tell you!) The cool thing about this place was that there weren't any cabins or house-like structures; instead, we slept in train carriages that had obviously been taken off the rails and used as shelters. Of course the carriages came equipped with all the necessities like electricity and plumbing (thank God). All in all, a good time!  Well, that's about all for now. I had to juggle going on this retreat with the ton of uni assignments I had to get done, and  that  wasn't fun. Meanwhile, I just got home from watching a comedy,  Connie  Carla.  Anyone seen it? It's about a couple of women fleeing a bunch of murderers, so they hide out in a drag bar pretending to be drag queens. Yup. Women playing men playing women. It stars Nia wotever her name is, the chick from  My Big Fat Greek Wedding,  as well as David Duchovny, a.k.a. ex -X-Files  dude Mulder. Queers and cross-dressers galore, in a mindless two-hour romp. Not a bad way to spend a Wednesday night. Heh.
