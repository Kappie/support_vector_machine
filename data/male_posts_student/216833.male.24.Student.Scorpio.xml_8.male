I'm looking forward to this 2-day cold snap coming up. Then sometime in december it will get up to 80 again and make me want to freeze myself through the blistering summer.  Just thaw me out when it gets cold again.  I am getting that itch to move and I'm pretty sure this time next year, I'm going to scratch it.
