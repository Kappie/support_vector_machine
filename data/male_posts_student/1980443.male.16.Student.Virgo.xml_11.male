When someone, does something courageous, or extraordinary that you would never do, or just being a great example of how to live life the way we're suppose to.  With all that said, my heros are my parents and sister (sorry Squeeb, you don't do much except say WEEEEE).  My dad has always been the most unselfish person I know, and he does it in a way in which he doesn't tell me - just the way he acts.  I know so many different things he does different to make his family better.  My mom is always using the Bible - ever since that counselor thing is goin' on.  She shows me when i'm wrong - how i'm wrong - and what I need to do to change it.  And my sister, wow, so many times she's encouraged me, I love her so much.  Most nights, my favorite thing to do was to walk in to her room at like 12 or something, while she's doing her devotions, and talk to her about anything and everything.  She was the coolest, who always tried to make time for me, well except when she went and did things too cool for me, : ).  But the list doesn't stop there, there are so many more people who are my heros.   Jabolini, Jabolini Africa  That's how we do things 'round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.
