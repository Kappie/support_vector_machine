Hmmm i just improvised just now, on clean, appregios on guitar, if you're interested......here are chords in which I used.......  F7m/5 003200 Cmaj7 032000 C7madd11+ 034000  These chords basically have very simple fingering, and tons of open strings which allow clearer appregios......and also, it still a pretty good progression for beginners, due to its simple fingering. But it can create amazing textures and tonal colours............  Hmmm, i went out with Chin han, Woon han and Ben to mediacorp today to collect Chin han's SHE mini-concert ticket, only 80 can go sia, and he was one of them, only sent in one entry where others sent in hundreds. Today, was a pretty good day overall...........hmmmm, its 10 and my previous post which i deleted i talk about both the mainstream and avant-garde in all forms of art.............but I've got no linggan now...............hmmmm i think i want to recollect my what happened on my birthday in the next post........
