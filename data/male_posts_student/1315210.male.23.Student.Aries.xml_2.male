I didn't know the answer to that, but i will agree with that people DO like to sniff at weird odours AND continue to smell them. I remember when I was a kid, I liked to take a deep breath of exhaust fumes coming from a bus pulling away from the busstop......... Maybe that explains all the ideas i get..........hmmm............i should take in more of those fumes..............
