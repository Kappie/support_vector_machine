I saw numerous clips this weekend about how it is the favorite, and all of these people saying that if it doesn't get the Oscar, then Bad Things should happen to the Academy.  First, I don't really care too much about the Oscars.  They never really reward merit, except for a few instances which seem to be the exception.  So I don't give them much stock.  But the universal accolade that is given to ROTK (Return of the King) once again bothers me.  I won't go into the massive, fundamental flaws behind the Tolkein work, and how it really is quite poor storytelling.  I've had that argument.  And I'm sure Mike will jump in and fefend the first movie, but I can't agree with that either.  The more I think about the complete trilogy the more I am convinced it is just such a poor story, no one could really make a good film from it.  The entire trilogy was mostly antiseptic.  There was little sense of doom or urgency.  The CGI hordes no longer inspire anything but cliche.  Really, does the sight of 100,000 CGI Orcs create any more anxiety than 10,000?  When I know that the fundamental premise of Tolkein is simple - no main character will pay a price to achieve victory.  You could point to Boromir, since he died at the end of FOTR, but I don't think he suffered as much as the audience was forced to suffer during the death scene that needed an intermission.  I've been pounded with clips of ROTK this weekend on the cable outlets.  I keep seeing whatever her name is, the woman that followed them to battle totting an undersized SHerpa on her horse.  I see her wanting to join in the fun of battle, seemingly oblivious to the consequences.  And why not?  Everyone who returns from battle waltzes in as if they just put in a hard couple of hours tilling soil.  No blood, no pain, and very little grime.  When she finally kills the incompetent Witch King, she's in no worse shape than if she had performed a little gardening in her back yard.  Antiseptic.  I understand they want the rating for maximum audience, and gore is not the ultimate indicator of the quality of a film, but when the film strives to make us understand that this is a War to end all War, and these people are willing to die in order to win, then we need to see how difficult it is to fight Sauron.    As it is, Sauron inspires no fear, hatred or even interest.  He is increasingly incompetent throughout the entire story.  In a final moment of idiocy, he actually SEES the sherpa with the Ring on the slopes of Mount Doom, but turns away so he can crush a pathetically small army of humans by pouring out an overwhleming number of bad guys.  If you have such numbers, and the human army is dependent upon you opening the massive gate before they can touch you, couldn't their final disposition wait a few moments while you take care of a short version of Luke Skywalker toting the equivalent of a proton torpedo in the immediate neighborhood of your exhaust shaft?  Can we talk about priorities?  I'm really indifferent about the films.  What sets me over the edge is the slavish devotion of so many people to such an inferior story.  There wasn't a single moment that really held any emotion or meaning to me, and I sat through nearly ten hours of film throughout the complete series.    Why don't we reward good storytelling over CGI?  An Epic is not an Epic because it is long.  An Epic is long because it requires depth to tell the story.  We learned nothing about these characters that wasn't already known in the first two hours.  No change, no evolution, nothing.    And never mind the misguided and ridiculous themes of the evil of technology and the purity of agrarian life.  Bah!
