I guess I was in need of something to just "spark" or "happen", and so I decided my hair was the perfect compromise. Nethertheless, it's amazing what unwanted attention the "anti-follicle" receive. As much as people like to rub and poke my head, I found disturbingly, a new strange (and hopefully not mental) side to my friend Suzanne. SHE DREW A NAZI SIGN ON MY TEMPLE |-:. So I'm not sure quite what to make of that or any of the other strange behaviour I have come across today (will get considering It's only  half past FUCKING 1 )  Neho, I think I've officially got fed up of the love torment friends decide that I actually like to hear, about their girlfriends and boyfriends "  problems  ". It's hard enough being a permanently celibate as I am, without having to hear other people's un-gratitude about the fact, despite the problems et al, that they actually have someone in there life that is actually prepared to call them their own. Maybe, I don't know, they should decide to think the whole relationship through before deciding to interrupt my sad but contempt bond with the official Chelsea management *sigh*. Oh well I know they don't have bad intentions, well  most  of them anyway, so, well, hmmm, I'm of to the shitter.... xBuBzx
