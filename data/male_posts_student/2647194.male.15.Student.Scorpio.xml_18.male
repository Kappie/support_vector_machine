It just made me get sick easier. Now I've got a horrendous stuffy nose with a mild sore throat. What f@#%ing fun.  Daily Recap: Math: Bleh Science: Test tommorow-and all 58 points or so are multiple choice!! Band: On Thursday, the Random (the MSA jazz improv), the choir, and the orchestra will be playing at the annual Nobel Peace Prize Festival at Augsburg College. The event runs all day, so unless you're going for your school, you won't be able to come. Spanish: RaNdOm SpAnIsH fUnNy Of ThE dAy: Mrs. Sustic asked Pat if he was going to cheat on the test by giving answers to someone else-half the class took it today, and the other half tommorow. She failed to think that Pat still did. English: Finish To Kill a Mockingbird tonight. The play that's coming up should be interesting. Social: Test tommorow! Blah, it shouldn't be too hard.  Anyways, back to the better part. I bought, or more like owe half of, a pair of Fischer classic cross-country skis today at White Wolf in Woodbury. It's kinda late in the season, but I should, er...hope...I'll be able to use them soon. Now I've got downhill skis and cross-country. I'll also be going back up north (hopefully I won't get deathly sick, and/or injure myself) to ski at Lutsen for two days. I also got a bad rap for wearing my hat today and looking like a "skater fag", to quote Derrick and everyone else. Apparently I looked too much like Ryan (sorry Kacy).  Apparently I look too much like everyone...
