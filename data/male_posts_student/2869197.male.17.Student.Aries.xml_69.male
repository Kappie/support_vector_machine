This may require several sessions as I am currently blogging from Angel Hall in the University of Michigan, and I must run off to my next lab in 30 minutes.  Let us begin at the beginning or at the least the beginning of the end of my last post. I went to Mexico. In ways, it was similiar to the last Mexico trip. I failed to develope any meaningful personal relationships, much less start any. I did not work hard enough in the Work Project. Many a time, there was no work to be done, but I was the one not doing it and this grieves me. Perhaps out of some cruel guilt reflex, I read my Bible relgiously (gah) throughout these times of low. Even the Mexicans begin thinking I was some reflective Jesuit priest or somesuch. The arts and crafts ran well enough, but of no credit to my personal workings. But through this great fiasco south of the border, God had something to tell me. At the last meeting, between great bouts of joyful tears and questionable singing, a small message was translated to us. It twas the story of Peter, when he could not catch any fish on the first boat outing but captured many on the second. The difference, I am told, was that Jesus was with him the second time round. I suppose you could consider this my first trip, absent of fish (meaningful goals reached). But in it is a ray of hope: with God, the second journey will be bountiful. Truth be told, I did not pray much, if at all, throughout the trip. I was most certainly not walking with Dios. I can only guess what the second trip shall be, figuratively of course, but I hope for it. I truly have taken into question not only my steadyness of action, but also of feeling. Good God, who was the last person I truly loved? I fight with my mother, I'm distant from the rest of my family (even extended). My beloved "girlfriend" Emily is a wonderful shy young lass, but I have not felt love for so long...I do not know if I have loved her. I have no friends to love. My relation with God is waning. I speak of active love, the only true and worthy kind. I passively love these all, but how false and pitiable is that? We shall see....  Now, I am in U of M for a reason, which may surprise some of my faithful (Dan? Reason? Surely Not!). But alas, I am here for a debate camp. So far so good. My roommate is younger and less experienced than I as well as being the only Louisianan from his school here. His name is Alexander *mumble mumble mumble*. I hooked up with Emily soon after finding my room. I found my room long after arrival. We got to Ann Arbor LONG after starting. I left for Ann Arbor a day after returning from Mexico. (reverse-chronological sentence...fun)
