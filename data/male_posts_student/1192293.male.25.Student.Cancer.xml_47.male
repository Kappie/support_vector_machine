"We must pay attention to the privacy of the families. That's what the policy is based on," White House spokesman Trent Duffy told reporters, describing that as "our first priority." If you believe a word of this bullshit, I've got a bridge to sell you.  SEVEN HUNDRED casualties into this war and  now  he's "moved"?  Maybe it's because he hasn't been to a single soldier's funeral in his entire presidency, even though he's somehow found the time to go to Camp David 78 times (I shit you not).  Or, maybe, it's because he's a FUCKING LIAR.  Think hard, folks.  What possible reason could he have for wanting to hide the bodies returning from Iraq?  The man who's presidency has overseen the sharpest decline in civil liberties in this country  ever , the man who brought you The Homeland Security Department, Camp X-Ray, The Patriot Act, The Department of Total Information Awareness, and Richard Ashcroft suddenly wants to protect someone's privacy?  Give me a fucking break.  That is perhaps the most insulting thing; that he thinks that we Americans are actually fucking stupid enough to swallow this load of shit.     urlLink Story
