I would like to have the spell checker automatically run after I hit "send," and to pause for review if it finds any spelling errors in a fashion similar to how it works if you hit "spell check".  For this to work without being annoying the spell checker MUST be able to add new words to its dictionary so it doesn't continue to pause everytime I send email and sign it my name, assuming my name is not already in the dictionary.  -Brett
