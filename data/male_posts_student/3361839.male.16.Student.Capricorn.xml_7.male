With  computers becoming such an important part of daily life people should  be restricted in what they can do until they prove that they are  intelligent enough not to become a victim. I am personally sick of  hearing all this bs whining from Computers users regardless what OS  they are running.  You need a license to operate a car legally and you can do serious  damage with that. With peoples naiveness they can do just as much  damage to economies and the world overall with their computers. Just  look at what happens when a new major computer virus comes out, entire  markets have to be closed down and cleaned out because people are to  damn stupid to just be out on the watch and practice safe computing!  Now part of that blame does rest on a media whom is to slow to react to  events like this, as well some of the blame rests on the company who  created the code which failed. But personally I feel the bulk of the  responsibility rests on the user especially if the virus or attack is  that but simply an email attachment.  What bugs me even more is peoples excuses for using Windows and then  giving me hell because they got a virus or they got hacked and all  their files were destroyed.    I know I am going to get heck because people want to be free with what  they can do but really if it means we can cut down on much of the crap  in the computing world isn't it worth it???    I am not saying that we should track people nor am I saying we should  dictate what people can do on the internet! I am simply saying that  people should be required at the bare minimum to know what they are  doing when they are on a computer and how to keep them from their own  blindness.  And for goodness sake stop saying that Linux is so much secure in  contrast to Windows. Unless you lock it down, it can be just as  insecure.  Iggy
