I have been keeping silent of it because I have things better to do than to debate with them. So now since I am in school and I have nothing better to do during this period, I shall write them a letter to pacify them and also soothe their heatiness with my consolation and sweet wording.    Dear MMT2J  crazy  women and men,  I know recently studies has been giving you  crazy  gals and guys a great amount of stress which derived all of you to be infatuated (meaning “To cause to behave foolishly”). I understand that you  crazy  guys have been undergoing perhaps hormone changes or menstruation that has causes you  crazy  guys to be immature at times. You  crazy  guys pretended sweet and innocent in front of me and take it as nothing had happened. That’s really good, this is what I call obedient patients from mental hospital. I know you  crazy  guys hated me after reading my blog.   But I wanted to strongly emphasize that while every effort has been made to prevent hurting people’s ego and reputation, I have no guarantee that it would offend you in one or any way. For goodwill, I greatly apologise to the characters involved.  Although my facts sound humiliation, but a fact is still a fact, you can’t change it. And what I am stating are purely facts and it’s supported with evidences and witnesses, I do not spread rumors around. So next time I shall attach photos, for example a picture of a girl being raped in my blog to prove I am correct.  I felt sorry in causing you  crazy  guys in this pathetic state, no I mean worsening. You guys are already in this sorry state before I started a blog. So that’s not my fault, and don’t worry I will quickly find a way to treat or cure to your terrible illnesses. In the meantime, please take note and good care of your health. Hope you  crazy  guys recover soon!  Your Lovable and Sweet Classmate, Lim Xing Yi   (This letter requires no signature as this is a computer-generated letter)
