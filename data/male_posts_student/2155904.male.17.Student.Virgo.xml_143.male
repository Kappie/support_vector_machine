Waking up today was nice because it was sunny out and very bright.  It seemed like a Wednesday morning it was so light out.  And it was pretty warm too.  The day was bland by blog standards (which have dropped considerably) but there were a few memorable moments.  Lunch time was great because it was so nice out and they went out to Pie for a splendid meal.  Then was 5th period.  With a sub.  The sub was taking attendance and Tyke waited til his name was called and was walking to the door as she said it.  He said here and then walked right out the door.  He turned back to tell Macaroon to meet him at his car at 12:45 and then left.  He made a little walk around and then met up with some pals who walked out to the parking lot and talked there for about 15 minutes or so.  Then Amed and Macaroon came out and they joined Tyke in his car.  They both left and it was just Tyke for a while.  He listened to his 70s mix and waited for Purdy.  It was so pleasant just sitting there with the window down, the sun roof back and the sun shining down with a side breeze blowing him softly.  It was so nice out he left the sun roof cracked and the window as well.  Damn that.  But after that he went over and talked with Purdy and then they walked to class together.  Physics was alright.  Long stories about things that don't seem to relate but then somewhat come together at the end.  Basically, a normal day.  After class Tyke walked outside and was shocked that the ground was wet.  Then he realized that he had left the sun roof open a little.  It didn't do much damage but there was a few drops of water inside.  No biggy.  But here's a funny story on stupidity or maybe not but probably.  Tyke got in the car and forced his way back so that he could back up and get out of the lot.  Well his car wouldn't turn after he shifted into drive.  So he kept trying and trying then he turned the car off.  Even if he was in drive he would go backwards but he had the e brake on when he turned the car off.  But then he tried to turn the car back on and couldn't.  He kept trying and trying but couldn't.  Piggy J had walked by and said that Tyke almost hit him when he was trying to back up but that wasn't on Tyke's mind.  The fact that his car wasn't working was a bit more concerning.  Well it took a while but then Piggy looked and laughed at Tyke that the car was in drive and that is why it wasn't starting.  So he put it in park and started it and then he went on his way as it worked fine.  Tyke still didn't know how the wheel wouldn't turn earlier but Tyke figures that he must not have turned the car on as it is a bit different to start the car than he has been used to.  So he must have only turned it on accessory and then the car just happened to roll backwards just like it would in reverse.  Who knows though.  Who knows.  It was pretty funny for observers and was pretty stupid at the time but that's ok.  The rain was more annoying really.  Stupid humid weather making it rain when Tyke was going to play some great bball with the guys.  But Tyke did get to work on his housing application for WSU.  His mom has gone to sleep so he didn't get it sent but now he only needs the credit card portion of the app.  So he is basically set for his next year of living.  Man, college is approaching deadly quick.  Yeesh.
