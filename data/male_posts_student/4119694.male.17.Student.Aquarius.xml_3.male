I finally got me one of these lil' Blog thingies, so now I can actually write down what I do and what I'm thinking and such... and then others can read it too.  Yesterday, after church, I basically sat on my butt, it being the first day in 3 weeks without me having to concentrate on the play... then Mike and I went out for Chinese, ice cream, and then we rented Blue Collar Comedy Tour and watched it with his parents... which was humorus in itself, listening to Carla (Mike's mom) laughing harder at the whole thing than we were... wow :-P  Today - My mornings are always boring, filled with chores and stuff... you'll find this a common factor over most of my Blogs... Went and picked up Mandy at 1, came back to my house, and just hung out and talked for the first time in 2 weeks.  She's been gone at Girl Scout camp, and I've been busy with The Buddy Holly story... God, I miss that.  I miss all the people from the play, all the fun times we had, and just the experience that I had while I was there.  If you ever get a chance to act or perform in a play or a musical... jump on it.  It's a great time.  I got bored tonight, so I went and joined Mike's church league softball team, which was exciting.  Church league, and Mike still gets mowed down at the plate by some stupid base runner... the guy got ejected though... and I've forgotten to slide since I played baseball 3 years ago and cut my leg up nice.  I'm glad that my "family" is all back in one place again... but sadly, Laura is leaving us again on Wednesday... going on vacation... and then Mandy is leaving on Saturday to go on vacation... and so I'm  either hanging out with Mike, or going to band camp... *blink*.  I don't really wanna get into detail about how my leg hurts, so I'm just gonna go change the bandages on it.   Mood: Mellow Music: Jainy (Five for Fighting)
