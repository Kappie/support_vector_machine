In addition, a certain roommate of mine was there. No freakin' bueno. A different roomie didn't want any company because he had to get up early to go to work. Graham and I were given permission to partake...and as you can probably tell from the picture, we certainly did.  I hope that you'll accept a raincheck for the upcoming weekend.  My sincerest apologies,  RT
