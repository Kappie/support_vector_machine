XP I am progressing in my book that i am on right now and that makes me happy. If i get all three books read before next wednesday i get a drawing tablet of my very own. ^_^ I should be getting sleep and reading more but it's all just to boring. I would rather sit here at the computer, on gaia, watching music videos on the TV. I have to help babysit at 8:00 a.m. and right now it's 5:00 a.m. so if i get any sleep at all it will be only a little bit so i plan on not sleeping at all now. Oh, and also there are a lot more friends that have joined this thing. :) A few of them are the ones i said before but now there are more and i think there is still another one working on his. XD Well i guess now it is back to half reading half chatting on Gaia. XP
