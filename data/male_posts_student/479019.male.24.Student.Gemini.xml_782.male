Was that the same house from 90210? Was that the same golf course from Saved by the Bell?   Then we met up with Heather at BJs. We're gonna go to Godfather's tonight. As  Bad Religion  sings... "come join us" at 8 PM.  I've been watching a lot of Dragon Ball also. I think Mr. Popo could whoop Yoda's ass really hard.  ***
