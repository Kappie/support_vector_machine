Leave a Note      good luck with everything [nevr 2 close]     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   hey kid, its nikki. k about the kevin thing, y'd u guyz brake up? he showed me the conversation but i didnt really understand. but i'll tell u this much, if he doesnt have a chance dont tell him he does. its alot better to be straight fwd and not get his hopes up. wutever the reason, do wut makes u happy. he'll be ok. i talked to him about it somewhat.      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Do what makes you happy... I want you to be happy. Dont worry about hurting me, it doesnt matter. I can handle it. Just do what makes you happy, and what feels right. (hug) And you're not a bitch. You just did what you thought was best. I dont care about you any less for it. Kevin      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I know the feeling. [versesolochorus]     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Nikki or whatever it is, you dont know her mind your f*cking business just because kevin is your f*cking best friend or whatever doesnt mean you can get up in chelseas business. Leave her ALONE!     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   That was incredibly rude, and completely unnessecary... she simply asked a question, and gave some advice. No need to be such an ass. Grow up.      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   well...i went through ur ENTIRE diary missy...and i must say that u have by far TOO MANY SURVEYS! i mean one survey lasted for like 20 pages! that is just ridiculous woman! tehe...well i was bored and read ur whole damn diary! i think it is funny how like in the beggining u wrote like "hey wuts ^" and stuff and now ur all sophisticated (if thats how u spell it!) well runnin outa room! xox-erin     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   WOAH sorry mister I know everything, Mr. I can give everyone advice, Mr POOSIE. She doesnt know Chelsea why dont u mind ur business, u can tell her urself since ur such good friends, you can answer her question. And the advice...was "unnescessary" because it was bitchy and not needed so why dont you go somewhere else and give others your little (hugs) faggot     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   PREACH IT BOYO! AMEN BROTHER!  WHOOO!  im freakin sick of people talking crap about people thye DONT FREAKIN KNOW  -mr hypocrtie himself, DEREK_      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   oh how i wish i could spell -derek-      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   hey k to the evin- the kid needs a (hug) and a ^_^ face to cheer him up. CALL IN THE (hug) PATROL! (hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)  (hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)(hug)      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   can someone get this kid a hug!? -derek-      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I'm quite impressed at how childish you manage to be... what a waste. Do you have a point, or did you just want to insult me? Nikki had every right to comment with her thoughts. She wasnt being bitchy at all. You had no right to be so rude to her about it. Nor do you have any right or need to act like this towards me. As for hipocrasy, you shouldn't talk. You have no idea who I am, and will     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   (continued) probably never meet me, yet you insult me and act like you know what you're talking about all the same. I would suggest that you grow up, as you've only made yourselves look more foolish.      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   OUCH! That one hurt, another blow dealt by Dr.Phil aka Mr Maturity aka kevin. Give it up YOU LOST!     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ... continuation yes I AM A FOOL AND IM PROUD OF IT, WHY ACT LIKE YOU'RE 40 WHEN YOUR 15-17 BLAM!     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   OH MY GOD IM SO SORRY! I DINT KNOW I WAS INSULTING THE ILL HIGH BIG GRAND DALAI LLAMA OF POOSIES! and no im going to cry in the corner because of your super dooper vocabulary. I can never compete. YOU HAVE ONE THIS TIME POOSIE MAN! BUT IT AINT OVER!   can i get an amen!      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Of the 3 previous entries the first 2 were from one person and the 3rd one was from another. JUST SO U WERENT CONFUSED!!!     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Its truely pathetic that you cant even manage to show some decency. I'm not trying to "win" anything. I'm simply defending my friend, who did nothing wrong. If you want to turn this into a flame war, take it elsewhere.     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Aint not your diary so shut the f*ck up! Don't try to tell me what to do when it's not even your diary. "But it's Chelsea I care about, she wouldnt want this going on, Im just trying to protect my ex-girlfriend"
