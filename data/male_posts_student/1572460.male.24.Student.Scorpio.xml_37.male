If you think Tull is a hard rock/heavy metal band, then you'll be mistaken. Very few of their work borders on hard rock. Tull is first and foremost, a progressive rock band that incorporates a mix of british/scottish folk melodies, blues licks, along with wonderfully creative acoustic-jazz escapades, backed up by impossibly dense lyrics. By impossible, I really mean it! With plenty of puns and alliterations, thanks to lead man Ian Anderson, one might require a PhD to analyse all their songs (from 40-something albums!). And if composing such profound material wasn't enough, Ian is the lead vocalist, the lead flautist, as well as the frontman on the acoustic guitar, harmonica, mandolin, whistles etc. If you want to check ONE Tull album, get Songs from the Wood, from which this song is. It's not in a 4/4 time signature, I think. Just notice how the bass guitar, flute and drums are blended.  12)  Jethro Tull - My God   Wow, My God is a beauty. This one's for THE ONE --  "People - what have you done, Locked Him in His Golden cage. Made Him bend to your religion, Him resurrected from the grave..." . Brilliant flute playing on this. Anderson is known to do crazy things on stage - like standing on one leg and making wierd noises when he's actually playing the flute. (Well, ummm...let's say, if I am not wrong, he actually burps in some of his studio version of songs, or whatever that means). Totally crazy. Tull has an exhasutive list of great songs, and it is a pity that I could only include two in this list.  13)  The Doors - Riders On The Storm   Like Tull, The Doors, too, is not a mainstream rock band. Doors is really really psychedelic though. A bit like late 60's Syd Barrett (early Pink Floyd). Ofcourse, its much much better than the eccentricity of Barrett. Myself and  urlLink Sid , who is the original Doors freak between the two of us, have been imagining how Doors would feel like after getting doped. On the other hand, we've been told by experienced dopers that you  cannot  imagine! Doping theory apart, the Doors sound is quite unique. Ray Manzarek is a genius on the keyboards/organ/piano as is evident in this song (and also particularly in Light My Fire). Jim Morisson's improvisations with the lyrics is impressive too.  "Into this house we're born, Into this world we're thrown, Like a dog without a bone, An actor out alone..."  -- and what an attitude to go with, when he's singing. The song has a real haunting quality to it, and I recommend listening to it in a dark room (with no lights at all). Let me know how you feel.  14)  The Doors - Spanish Caravan   I have picked this song solely for its beautiful classical guitaring. Not that the song is bad otherwise. Robbie Krieger's fingerstyle, flamenco guitaring is awesome. I think all the Doors musicians were classically-trained players. And you can see it in their carefully constructed pieces.  15)  Led Zeppelin - Kashmir   Most of the people (including me) who first hear Zeppelin, are guilty of having a pre-conceived notion about the band's music, to be nothing but shrieks, screams, and shredding vocals and leads - "loud noise", to put it in simple terms. However, think about it logically, if not musically; because Zepp is not the numero uno rock band for nothing. I am gradually beginning to realize this myself. I still find Robert Plant's vocals too wild and frenzied for my liking. But that isn't to take away from their immense talent in creating some of the most influential rock music you will ever hear. Kashmir has a heavy Asian influence, the guitar riffs and violin creating a stunning base. This one has one of the better Zepp lyrics too. And I take my hat off to John Bonham. The thunderous rhythm he creates by literally pounding the drumset, is of the highest class. There is a point when everything else in the song pauses for just a few seconds (i.e. no vocals, no guitar, no base, nothing), except for a very shot drum interlude by Bonham. Only a genius can do that. Sheer brilliance!!    urlLink Part IV: Songs #16-20
