First it was the Lit PC Paper, then Math and Econs clashing, then Lit Paper 1 and 4, then my AO chinese oral exams and now this.  I know I'm gonna get slaughtered for putting so many 'then'-s in one sentence, but yeah.  I'm way stressed out. I screwed up my Math, Econs and Lit up, that's practically all my papers, but I won't know until I get the results I guess. But my orals, I'm sure I messed up - BIG TIME.  I supposed to lead worship tomorrow and Sarah can't play. I don't wanna put her in a difficult spot either, so I'm stuck having to get things working. I have no idea how. And I'm feeling a tinge of regret. Regret for not picking up the keys earlier this year. Ahh!!  God you take everything k. EVERYTHING. Cause I'm breaking - I know it'll work out. Cause God, you always pull through. ALWAYS.  Hopeful, Sherman
