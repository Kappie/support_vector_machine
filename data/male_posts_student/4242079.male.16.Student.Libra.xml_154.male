If I have no car, which I don't anyway, then I can afford to pay rent. I've talked about moving out before. I know. But I have always stayed. And now, with no car, there is no reason for me to stay. I can't get a car until I work, but I can't work until I have a car. Or my parents move to Red Deer. Not likely. And so. That is what I think I will do. I don't think there is much point in me staying here. Of course, I will end up staying. But it is nice to have ambition.  My ambitions haven't really been that great lately. I find myself nearing the second rung of a coprorate ladder that I have no desire to climb. The only friend that I bother to see is a 23 year old athiest. I only see him because we work together. The only real female interest I have is pretty much untouchable. I don't want a new job, I just want more money. No. It's not even a matter of want. I need more money. Plain and simple. I am not paid for what I'm worth. I know, I know. Story of everyone's life. But I do a whole lot of extra stuff, customer service, delivery, shit like that. I could make the same as I make now flipping burgers, and not have to worry about all of that. I love my job. I hate Intertan. Intertan=Tandy International=Owners of RadioShack. Such is life.  Life. With no God, there is no afterlife. With no afterlife, there is no reason for this life. So, if there is nothing before, and nothing after, it is the cause for nothing now. The process of belief is an elixer when you're weak. Was I right and now am wrong, or was I at one point wasting my time?
