Sometimes things have a way of workin themselves out.We females dont always initiate things which scare us becuase of our own nature that so dearly craves security. She might feel the same way but might need some time to come around. Its kind of the way we work. Hang in there and keep ur head up.   I really thought "anonymous's" thoughts were interesting considering the conlusions I have reached with my lost love. After a lot of thinking and taking long walks, a part of me tells me that it was for the better. I had really lost myself in politics once the war started. I became a political machine with no concern with the beauty of life and to me that is very important because that is one of the things I am fighting for--for humanity to retain its understanding of life's beauty. Losing my love showed me what what I had lost in myself--my own humanity. Something that still bothers to me some extent to this day was when I originally broke up with her. I heard her cry for a hour and then she hung up. After that I kept doing my research on Hindu Nationalism and I do not think that reflects well on my humanity at all.   I have been greedy all my life. I have endulged in all the emotions "God" has given us. I have been green with jealousy, delirious with happiness, and intoxicated with love, filled to the brim with joy, and the same with sadness. If my life was a canvass, it would be covered with all the colors of those emotions and with any painting, too many colors will only confuse the artist to the point of insanity. I have for so long been lucky enough to experience so many emotions that my own canvas is heavy with paint.   Breaking up with my love has given me the time to stare at the canvass of my life and I know how lucky I have been. (I am not sure where I am going with this ramble now... hehe) But I think my point is that whatever happened was for the better. It was a broken heart that has helped me realize my own humanity. My own understanding of love has grown deeper and richer. Whoever I chose to love in the future; I will have more to give them then before. I know my own cup of love has been carved deeper due to my experiences of the last three years and that is why I have no regrets. It will be another journey and I believe that it will be even more beautiful for my lover and myself then it was in my previous relationship. I have learned love is not the end of all things. That it is infact truly a journey in understanding oneself and your partner. In that sense, I have come to understand myself on a more meaninful level and so love has been a powerful teacher for me. I do not know if I am being clear about things.  I would also like to dispell any illusions about myself right now. (This is wierd because I am now engaging in conversations with people who I do not know. It is not just a journal anymore, but a true blog where I am interacting with people over the Internet; another product of my new course.) I do not want to come off as a perfect romantic or lover. I am 100% sure that I hurt my love's feelings in the past and that I disspointed her at times. I know I have committed many sins (from an Islamic perspective) and continue to commit some of those sames sins--drinking, smoking, drugs, endulgence, etc etc. I just do not want to lie about who I am.  I also know that she has made the decision to start fresh herself... ... ...
