Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Flap Your Wings - Nelly  Every summer, it seems the ultimate epitome for hip-hop stars and RB groups to create that nagging, ceaseless dance hit (the “urban Macarena” if you will) to last for summers to come. Viable attempts have been made (most recently and memorably Lil’ Jon’s “Get Low” of ’03), but apparently enough room was left for Nelly to pump out “Flap Your Wings,” the headlining single to his third release, “Sweat.” Continually demanding that you “get your eagle on,” Nelly creates an animalistic dance move cousin to such classics as the jitterbug, the camel walk, the chicken dance, the monkey, and the bunny hop. The problem, though, is that the music is terribly empty (at times during the verses dropping to merely a drumbeat) aside from a few organ octaves, which lack the vigor to convince anyone to bust out like an endangered animal. Bottom line: Don’t be surprised if you’re wife doesn’t “flap her wings” at your wedding reception.   The Verdict:  3.5/10 - Brouhaha  ( 1.75/5 )
