And it will increase your enthusiasm for engaging in the wholesome actions and deeds which lead to happiness and joy. - The Dali Lama Profound, yet simple.  Chew on that one for a while brain!  So yeah.  It's Veteran's Day.  Happy being a Veteran for all those who have fought for our country.  What exactly is fighting for our country?  Is it like someone is trying to take us over?  I mean, with the Revolutionary War, we fought for our country.  For the Civil War, we fought for our country.  But everything else, it just sounds like we wanted to kick someone's ass for the fun of it.  World Wars?  We fought for the freedom of millions?  Sure that's a good thing, but did we really  have  to get involved?  Nah.  We could have stayed out if we wanted to.  But what about the Lama?  Are we creating suffering or trying to end it?  We get invovled in these wars and lose countless amounts of lives, and do nothing but create suffering for ourselves and the ones we conquer.  What about the ends?  What about the means?  What about terrorists who hate us?  Are we somehow to blame for their existence?  So how in the hell do we correct this without having to just kill thousands of those who stand in our way?  Like the Lama said:  reflect on the cause of suffering.  Go look in the mirror now.  I think the reflection might surprise you.  Happy Vet's day, and for all those who are soon to be Vets, keep your heads down, stay safe, and please, come back in one piece.  I  know this is all one incomplete thought after the next, but my mind is swirling faster then I can write.  Time for statistics.
