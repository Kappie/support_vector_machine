Starburst Twizzlers and Lime-flavored chips are a recipe for disaster.  2.  Dominoes buffalo wings after a heavy night of drinking is also a none-too-smart idea.  3.  Some milkshakes do not bring boys to the yard.  4.  Apples taste better than Windows.  5.  Never take a picture in a Tijuana strip club.  6.  Daniel is the only one in the world with an interest in forum browsing (click on it in profile if you don't believe me).  7.  It is possible to accidentally uninstall programs from a computer and have an uncle that can do anything.  8.  Expect the unexpected, unless your Nathan, in which case expect a life long struggle with the toilet.  9.  Transos are people too.  10.  FFUSFOSTAR  Thank you and good night!
