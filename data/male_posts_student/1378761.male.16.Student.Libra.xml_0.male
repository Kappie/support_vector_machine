As far a I know Lima does. I kinda wish we didn't. Then I can tell everyone what I was doing when the power went out. Saint Marys has it's own power plant and we own a 5500 watt generator full of gas. O'well. Just fell sorry for the folks that don't because it is hotter than crap outside.   Well this is the new blog. I will post stuff up here every once in a while (when school starts I will have some more bored time). When I update the website I'll post the changes I made here, so be looking out.  That's it for now. Catch you later ~Eric~
