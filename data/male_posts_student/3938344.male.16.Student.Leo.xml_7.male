One of the only girls I had a chance with lives in fucking Nevada and thinks I'm crazy, the other is obsessed with her asshole ex, and one of the only girls that like me is an ugly stalker.  Now, where do I begin...  Now, I've met some girls I've been interested in in my time.  None so much as this one.  This girl is not only hot, she's smart, she's funny, she has a personality (a rare thing indeed), she speaks fluent German and she plays guitar in an all-girl punk (made me wince, but fixable) band.  However, there's 2 large problems in my way.  One of these is the fact that she lives in the shithole known as Nevada, which is as far from Maryland as possible as far as I'm concerned.  The other is that, because I had a song stuck in my head, didnt have the CD with me and felt a compulsion to mouth the words, she thinks I'm absolutely insane (no matter how I tried to explain, she still thinks I talk to myself).    On the positive side, because of her, my sentence upon the West Coast (it all needs to be blown off the face of the earth) has been revised (it all needs to be blown off the face of the earth, except for Nevada).  I feel proud of myself.  Now, before I met her, there was a girl I knew locally.  Not exactly a prize trophy, but relatively good looking nonetheless and cool to boot.  One little problem.  Some people have love triangles screwing them over; I happen to be fortunate enough to have a love pyramid here.  She is also being chased after by 2 boys who both go to her school (I don't) and so see her every day.  The one she hates, and so is inconsequential.  The other is the problem, in that he's not all that interested but she can't get enough of him to the point where she ignores nearly everything else as a possibility.  She was bragging at one point that he called her up wasted and told her he loved her (if you feel good because of something like that, you're really obsessed or just screwed up).  Now, I would just leave them be, but I know he's gonna disappoint her again and again (it's just that they're incompatible), so I (idiotic moralist that I am) am trying to find someone (anyone, not necessarily me) who she will be happy with who won't let her down.    You may be wondering, does anyone show any interest in me? The answer is yes, but I wish they didn't.  About 3 years ago, I knew a girl who had the biggest crush on me, and though she was ugly, I was going along with it for a while (hey, why not).  That is, until she gave out my screen name to every girl on her street, which was not cool when I couldn't get on without at least 3 people who hadn't even heard of our school wanting to talk to me.  So, I shut her out, thinking it would just fade into the past after a while.  I thought it had, until about a month ago when I got the creepiest one-letter IM ever to my screen name ("y?").  Now, I hadn't even seen her in the distance since about mid-eighth grade, so this came as a complete shock.    That is why if I ever hear from her again, I will welcome her with open arms...and a machete in each hand.  Well, that's enough self-pity for one night.  Hey, maybe I'll come up with something productive tomorrow!
