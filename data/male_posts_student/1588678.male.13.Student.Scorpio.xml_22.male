De La Salle is now 145 games straight making them the #1 High School Football Team in the Nation. Even though everyone knew De La Salle was going to slaughter any team they had to face, they brought in this team from Louisiana. Their school is Evangelic Christian High School. In case you don’t know who De La Salle is, they’re a well known Catholic school in sunny Concord, CA. Two religious schools. Gee, I wonder who’s side God was on? Okay, back to the game. De La Salle won 27 to 10. Even though De La Salle won, Louisiana was the one threat to De La Salle. Well, they’re not much of a threat anymore, hehehe.   Thanks to that suck-ass Astroturf at the DVC, De La Salle’s starting quarterback screwed up his leg when he was running and his feet just got stuck in Astroturf. I imagine he’ll be out for a while. I’ll try to get his name.   Well, De La Salle’s unstoppable! 145 games straight. Bring on any team and we’ll chop their balls off and use them as earrings. That’s what we do round these parts. Mmhmm. Oh yeah, before I forget, you can e-mail me and ask me questions or just give your opinion about Suburban Myths. So long.
