Ok my day started at like 11 a.m which is like the latest time ive gotten up at these holidays so far!Yikes!Alarming!So I was rushing to get ready and bla cause Connie and Oscar was coming over to do our dumb and screwed up sejarah project which is like Chapter 10 of the syllabus which is err Dasar British dan Kesannya Terhadap Ekonomi Negara..  So Oscar came at like 12pm and we were just lazing around waiting for Constance to come and like turned on music on my laptop and cause the dining table in the front was like didn`t have a stable surface the sound was all screwed up so like Linkin Park - Numb was like going at like /2 according to him which caused him to laugh like a jackass...bloody bastard!And so were all the other songs like Incubus..bloody hell..So moved everything to the main dining table in the dining room..Then finally all the sound was alright!  After waiting for abt 5 ice ages or so Cons came at like 12:50pm!So late...errgh..Haha..she brought her laptop and we started typing up stuff...she was relatively quick on her assignment cause I was like slow in mine cause I had to birng down my radio for them and what now..get sodas for her and go get reference stuff and Adobe Photoshope Deluxe to install on her laptop I think..then after a while the fan blew my sejarah text book`s inside of the back cover with all the stuff needed to be in the scrap book and we realised it was all wrong and I kena in the from Cons..haha so in the end we got lazy and hooked up the internet to our laptops and started having fun hehe..  Took down a microphone which worked well on my laptop but didnt function onCons laptop so we started having fun with it and then Kok Yoong was online!Hehehehe damn funny la...under Cons`s email we started messaging him and he seemed to get pissed off and like Cons then said me and Oscar was here so he was like at 1st wondering why Cons so vulgar...we started insulting hima nd what not..damn fun la!To bad didn`t save the convo!So bloody damn funny...we started taking turns insulting him and like mainly it was that Oscar talking and mocking him with 'Chee Kok Face' 'CB' and more..hehehehe damn funny la...Oh yeah and Cons visited my blog and read the part which I have about her and she was gonna kill me so I ran away and started screaming like some amd dickhead..haha my parents were out so we were noisy like crap..haha OScar was more interested in sleeping instead and bla...  And then Cons started playing around with ym phone,call ppl la and bla and then she asked for more covers and started drawing some new one`s which are pretty nice so if you see my handphone cover and see that its very gay then it`s not my fault!  Then OScar went back at 3pm and soon my parents came home then got ready to go to Vinod`s party or the party for Vinod at Stefan`s hse...dad sent us...it was pot-luck so like I brought 3bottles of RC Cola...  So met alotta ppl there and what not,Nicola,Nishanti,Sithira,Ash Chong,Ting,Nick,Zyl,Shameer Ali and Abu,U-Waye and lots more la...ok so Cons was a bit bored there and like she and Div taught me how to play cho tai ti which yes I sound like a loser only learning how to play now..U-Waye taught me a few years ago but he explain like 1 dumb guy only...and like 3 or4 guy got beaten by a girl...terrible...then soon Cons went back at 5pm and she went back to ym place to pick up her laptop..but left her books for me to type up stuff in a summary form and bla..so called mom and aske dher to open the gate for her and bla...  Then Sashya came and stuff...played ISS I think on pS2 in Stefan`s room...damn fun..I played Dinni like Brazil vs Italy and it eventually became like 10men on 7 cause I miss timed all my tackles and soon I had to be careful cause one more red card and I lose on forfeit!Damn!I missed a great chance with Vieri but I made the shot to powerful and almost gave away a few penalties...I was desperately defending and stuff and like Dinni imself like messed up like a truckload of chances to put it away and I held out til a penalty shoot-out even!I scored the 1st but Dinii missed but in the end he won 4-3 cause I missed the last penalty!Damn damn damn..!Just move the control stick a little bit oso can go wide arr...pundek betul hahaha but it was dman fun la....I was gonna play Navin but though I wasnt gonna be around by then..and then after that we sang happy birthdya to vinod though his b-day was like during the exams time and Stef insisted they celebrate..hahaha I started losing my voice b4 so I was at the top of my voice singing..haha..  Hahaha I was suppose to leave at 6pm but didnt hehe...just said I was goin back later haha...So soon more and more ppl left and soon like me,Abu,Stef,Sash,Navin and also Karl which he left after a while thankfully!We talked alot abt stuff cartoons and alot..damn nice..haha ate the dessert Navin made...its some hideous but not bad whip cream thing with those canned soup fruit stuff..which turns out that Navin made several improvisions which lead to me making funny remarks abt it..haha...damn it was fun there..turns out everyone else was still in the room playing ISS haha..  So then like went back with Abu..which had me him,Ali and Lam crammed in the back..damn Abu`s Perdana`s pick up and bump handling and general is better than mine..dammit..so sent back Lam 1st to Bangsar Park..damn he looked different..haha all formal shirt tucking in haha..hes a nice guy turns out..I used to think he was like those typical chinese morons but he`s not..also found out that Rai smokes..I heard earlier but this time its confirmed..bloody guy..Also Aizyl has moved to Kota Kemuning and and is like schooling there now...he and Ryan left a lil early cause they were attending some Yamaha Concert at the Putra World Trade Center or PWTC which was featuring some Japanese guy I think according to them...and then like Abu`s dad was going around with a pretty muc empty tank of fuel!The light was already on so had to stop at Mobile to get the gas and like rm50 only made the tank go up to like just above the three quarters full mark..a full is like rm70 or rm75 I belive liek when I 1st got mine..damn that car can load up on fuel like madman!Then finaly got home at like 8:45 pm or so and like mom and dad werent home cause they went to Klang for some wedding..so I just ate swiss rolls and stuff and lepak online and stuff and slept at like 2am as usuall!
