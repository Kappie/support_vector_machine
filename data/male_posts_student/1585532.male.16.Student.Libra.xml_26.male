Seriously though, this game is pretty cool.  You like...steal cars and shoot crap....Take your anger out on virtual people.  Anyways, with school around the corner (sucks for you!  Especially people who go to Pathetica!), I'm gearing up for a whole 'nother year of slacking and sleeping, with some independent study thrown in to the mix, not to mention the oh-so-obligatory soccer.  And really, this is uber cool.  I mean, I don't even have to really have a set "wake-up" time anymore.  I just hit the sack when I'm wasted, and then wake up when I recover.  This way, I don't have classes to be late to or any crap like that.  So in closing, sucks for everyone that has to go to school.  Ta.
