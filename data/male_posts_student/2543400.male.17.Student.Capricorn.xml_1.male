     
      Warping away into nothingness Watching the rose go through it's time Waiting for my rose to find it's roots  Life is but a rose So beautiful, yet so hard to grasp It has many faces all mine are dreadful  It is not my time When will it be my time? Waiting for the rose to change Waiting for the beauty to show  All I see is the thorns pierce through me the touch of pain as it destroys me slowly.  As revelations come and go lifes true eyes show. Life is not yours to have
