I got Wyrd Sisters back from Mrs. Grabill today after a long four or five-month absense! (The DaVinci Code is still out however... ) Also, Michael is reading The Light Fantastic! All in all, this is a big Discworld day for me.  I'm so excited about this spring break. Aside from doing nothing, I plan to do lots of things. But don't worry, they're things that basically amount to nothing. Like working on my senior year scrapbook and my Star Wars album (I hope to bring that on Tuesday to show off, 'cause it's pretty) and I plan to attmept my very first post on fanfiction.net. I'm going to fix up Dex's Diner and stick it up to test format. Plus I'm almost done with my Velma Kelly story. And I need to finish my Ani/Padme essay. And make some headway in "Surrender." But it's all okay, because I feel like I've got a good burst of creative energy going.  So everybody wish me luck! Yay!  It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.
