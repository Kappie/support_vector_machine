Yesterday was all sorts of productive.  I got to go out to spokane, and visit my pro mylan in spokane county jail.  It was surprising to him, but we didn't show much to each other, other than the occassional laugh or smile.  Had to bring some bad news to him though, because our aunt had a pretty harsh heart attack, and she lost memory of who people are.  I also did inform him of a possible interview hook up that might happen, but will have to wait and see on that.  That took place in the afternoon.  Later on, I go to the mall and pay my cell bill for the 1st time in awhile.  Sadly, checked my messages and there weren't any.  After having some overpriced mall food, walked around to kill time while they were getting my phone up to 'connected again' status.  I know it was worth it when I was in school, but now that I'm back home, paying 85 dollars a month for a phone I'm hardly using does not seem very economical to my financial status of being a li'l bit on the broke side.  Well, after the phone got hooked back up, I called up some folks from school.  I got to holla @ Grant, Tanya, Mario, and Russ.  All these conversations were going on and I was supposed to be having dinner w/ my brother.  I think that was rude, but damnit, I just got my phone turned back on for the first time in a long time.  So, I'm still on the phone and my bro heads home.  After talking my battery to near death, I decide I better get some petro.  That's cool, but I have a chord to plug in the lighter, but the lighter fuse goes out?  The temp solution, switch fuses w/ the rear window defogger.  It works, then I switch back.  After that happens, I'm almost on my way back home when I decide to hit up Trav.  We get to talking and he's asking me to roll through and check the spot.  Being the unexcited person I was @ the time, I up and decide, "why not?"  Well, it ended up being a small gathering, and for a lot of the time, it was basically me, trav, and ryan outside.  To kill time, trav and I were freestyling around trying to come up w/ hooks, or inspiration for some lyrics.  Basically though, we were kinda running off at the mouth, and bs'ing for no real reasons.  Went home, went to bed, and called it a day only to start another one after it was all over, almost...
