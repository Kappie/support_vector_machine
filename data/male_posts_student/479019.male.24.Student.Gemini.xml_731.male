So far, I’m just reading about the terrain in the Mediterranean and how it relates to the people. It’s great stuff.  I got an A in 572E! I want to get Tom’s comments on my paper.  I also did a tiny bit of writing today. I want to mail my papers to Benita on Monday.  I got a call around 8 AM from a university phone number, and when I called back it was no answer. I wonder who called me.  I’m going to see LOTR with Steff tonight.  ****
