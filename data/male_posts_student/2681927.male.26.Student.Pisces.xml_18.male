And that's only in the overtime.   Other than that, the Dutch's had more of ball possession but didn't create chances in the same effect. Sweden had some opportunities that with some more luck could have led to something more than just opportunities.  In the penalty shoot-out, the Dutch players were able to keep cool in a way that the Swedes couldn't. At least, so it seemed.   My Man of the Match: Ruud van Nistelrooy
