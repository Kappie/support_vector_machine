Just a li'l bit hard, but only if you are not really in shape, which I am not.  Dang, I started out pretty good, averaging about 6 minutes every half mile for the first half of the 3 mile hike.  Instead, I ended up just under 40 minutes for the final time.  Pretty good though, because the last time I did it, summer of 2001, I barely made it within the allotted time given.  Didn't know what to expect, or how to do the thing, just showed up and tried it out.  Now, I gotta go and get my physical faxed over to mt. tolman so I can officially be put on the list, when they start forming crews for firefighting.  Man, is that going to be a relief, getting some quick income.  I still need boots though, and those run a good 100 - 150 dollars for a basic pair.  Oh, and then you can throw in the extra pair of shoe strings, and some oil too, not to mention your socks as well.  Altogether, I'd say the price of that alone might run you close to 175 - 200 bucks.  OH Man, my shoulders are sore, my calves are sore, my ankles are feeling it, and even my neck seems to be begging for relief.  More than likely, I'm looking at some cramping today if I don't actually get some water, or some form of liquids in my system throughout the day.  I already chomped up 2 bannannas and even downed a multivitamin ( not knowing if it'll help, but what the heck ).  I figure I'd like to rest, but am afraid to wake up grabbing my leg from aching and cramping.  Well, other than that, not much is going on here on the ole colville rez.
