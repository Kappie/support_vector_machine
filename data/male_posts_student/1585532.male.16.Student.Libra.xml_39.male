After getting woken up at like...7 am (which is early for me), I went out to the DLR at about 8:30.  Got there, got in, blah blah blah.  First ride I go on, the rocket things.  Fun times.  After that we walk over and ride Indy.  Ooo fun boulder smash its over.  Then we go on the Jungle Cruise.....I don't know why we did...but we did.  Okay thats over, let's go on the big spooky house, also known as The Haunted Mansion.  Fun, got off.  Splash has only a 20 minute wait.  Hmm.... why not?  Okay its been over 3 years since I've been on this thing.  It's really freakin cool...if you like getting wet.  After that we go on the Canoes.  Which were full of tards who can't paddle for crap.  Nobody understood the word "rhythm."  Kinda sad.  After that, uh....oh yah..Haunted Mansion.  After that, ooo Pirates.  Arrr.  Best.  Ride.  Ever.  Becase I get to say.  Arrrr thar be x number of people in my party says aye.  Yah shut up pirates rock.  Then we went over to Tomorrowland, or...Whole-lotta-nothingland.  Went on Star Tours...wow.  Okay...got off, and went into the arcade.  (best part of my day).  We go and I play DDR 5th and Extreme.  w00t.  Go eat pizza.  Mmmm.  Went over to Dirt Cheap Attractions....er Califlour Adventures.  Went on Screamin...which was broken.  So we waited.... then  we went on Screamin.  That orange crappy ride broke.  So we went on Soarin'.  Whee okay over.  Go back to Disneyland and go on..Haunted Mansion.  Yay.  Okay after that um...back over to Tomorrowland, and I play more DDR.  We go in Innoventions...and I play some dumb soccer game that blew because China beat me.  And then....uh.  We went on Haunted Mansion like..4 times.  Okay, hungry.  Let's go to Downtown Disney.  We rode the Tin can on a Toothpick (The Monorail) and ate food.  Okay, come back.  Its like...8:40 PM or something now.  Lets go on Haunted Mansion!  Okay, so we did.  Met my old Jr High/High School friend that I hadn't seen in like....forever.  After that um...we went on the ride.  Okay done.  Time to go home.  Oh look, its my friend again.  Got to stop and talk with her for like...10 minutes.  Which was awesome, since I haven't seen her since like 9th grade.  I gave her my sn and then I went home and at Jack in the Box.  There's a fun day in a nutshell for you guys.  Okay...it took me a really freakin long time to type this, so...bye.
