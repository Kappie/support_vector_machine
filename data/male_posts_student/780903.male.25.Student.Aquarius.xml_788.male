Twas the night before the night before the night before Christmas And all through the house The presents were sleeping For kids and for spouse They were wrapped in the closet With ribbons so tight They were battery-powered But not on tonight They were resting and ready In places they hide For gift-getting people With mouths open wide To tear off all the paper And throw out the card To be shaken and rattled Felt if soft or if hard So the presents were resting As you were asleep And you hear little patters From small little feet As the closet gets opened The wrapping gets torn Guess it can't wait three days Until Christmas Day's morn But there's just disappointment The feet go away There are no presents there For this creature that day He comes back in the morning You wake with the fog And you see who was looking For gifts Was the dog.
