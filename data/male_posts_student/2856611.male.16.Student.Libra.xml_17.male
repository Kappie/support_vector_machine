I saw the Butterfly Effect, and they quote at the start of the film the Chaos Theory, I got REALLY interested in it and looked more into it and the more I read the more it made sense and the more life makes sense when you apply this possibility to every aspect of it. Example, your pet is about to die, something in your and that pets life happened to cause that pet to die, either it ate something, it got hit by something or attracted an illness. Nothing happens by accident or at random that pet can't just wake up one day just dead or about to die because of no aparent reason. Anyhow point to that is that my life at the moment seems to relate to that alot, I failed IT, I can't say when someone asks me why I failed that I don't know because thats not true, I must of done something to cause this and the reason for that is that I didn't do the work. There are other things happenening and aswell that personally I would rather not dsicuss in public but their pretty big. I've lived a good time lately, I finished school monday which was cool but sad in the same way because I'm going to miss alot of it, especially Xav who's going to atlantic college, hes a good man! But yeah, yesterday I went to the park with Betty, which was amazing, we talked and stuff and yeah it was just really cool. Shes great. Muse are cool, I can play part of Hyper Music *smiles* meh, ah well, bye.
