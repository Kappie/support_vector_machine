Hmmm..Mother came back with chee cheong fun, we ate, I watched TV and at 11, I went offline to prepare to go meet the cats to play basketball.   Hmm. There were me, HL, Gloria, CQ, WQ, PY, Joyce, HM, ThongZhen, Eugene and Jason. Meow moo meow. We waited around for XC, KS, CK and Janet to come lor. Okay, we didn't actually wait. We played first. Meow moo. They came later lor. We played and played. I was like kinda not very sporty, I ain't used to playing with TZ they all ma. Heh. We played till about 2+pm. I was terribly hungry. We walked towards Causeway Point to eat, and I could faint from the hunger.   The place was full. KFC, LJS....so idiotic! I want to eat something! They all want XC to pay, but XC is very unwilling lor, why force him. Want to go where, Seoul Garden ar. Stupid. We (Me, Ji, Gloria and HL) found ourself space in McDonalds...they say want to go Seoul Garden. I burst out lor. I am terribly hungry. All 4 of us want to stay at Mc, they say go Seoul Garden. We don't have the moolah! I shouted at CK lor...I am very extremely hungry. I just wanna eat. Can I even eat in peace? We then brought something to eat, the rest found spaces. Meow.   After that, the peeps went pooling. I initially didn't want to play, because I have no money. XC said he's treating, so why not. Yeah. HaHa. I feel like I am "qiao zha"ing him, but he was the one who suggested it first and he even asked me to play. So, ayiah, play lor. HaHa. I am in the same team as CQ, Janet and Joyce the "Jinx". We won all, but one, rounds. HAHA! Even ducks are jinxful. At 6, we went home lor.   Hmm. I ate chicken rice for dinner. Hmm.. I didn't do much of MNI essays homework this time, owing to the going outs and the release of O Levels results.  Yeah. I only managed to do Potions, and I am attempting DADA later. I think only these two la. Heh. I am a meowing cat.  Okie. I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
