Fans are an obvious tool, but they are noisy and they blow in your face, causing one to feel even more tired than before. Air conditioning is even better, but for those of us who don't have air conditioning, piggybacking is required. Go to a restaurant instead of cooking. See a movie at the theater instead of watching television. Visit the public library instead of reading your mail/newspaper/books at home. But the best way to fend off the high temperatures? Ice cream. Oh yes. Half gallons on sale for $2.99 today; stock up and ride it out. Only 60 days until Labor Day...
