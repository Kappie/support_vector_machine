We looked at her pictures and played with her TalkGirl, great times. We ate a lot of gummy bears and I put these little things in Roxanne's hair just to annoy her. Because I'm cool like that. You liked it Roxanne. We stayed till around 4:30, and then we walked back to Andrew's got his bike, and then went to my house and I got my bike. We then road up to see a really cool car. And then we road back to Andrews house and he kicked my butt in Tony Halk. Then, I had to go, I was going to have to watch my brother, but he was invited by a friend to go to the pool, so my parents took me out to Pizza Hut instead. And then I got home from that, and Kyle asked if I wanted to go ride around with him. So he came over, and then we started to go on our regular bike ride to K-Mart. Well the wierdest thing happend. I was riding along right? And there was this bird in the road, I really didn't think anything of it. I was right in my path, and you know they move before you even get close. Well this one didn't, but I really still didn't think anything of it. Because it still had time to move. Well, It didn't. I look down, and I see this bird, and then I see my tire just run over it. I just scream omg! And Kyle says the same thing because he heard the crack. It was the wierdest thing, after I ran over it, it kinda flapped its wings a little bit, wobbled over to the side of the road, and then just feel over. I felt bad, but why didn't it move? I was going like 3 MPH on my bike. I think it was stoned or something. But may that bird rest in peace. Well, after that wierd phomonon, me and Kyle take the new bike path to K-mart because its a really good ride. Well we get to K-Mart and go for the drink isle like normal. And let me tell you, K-Mart sucks. They have nothing to drink. At all. So after that we go take a look at the CDs. We leave our mark like we usually do by messing with the little signs they have. It's fun, and they never fix them so there always the same way everytime we go back. But we were thristy so we go over to Krogers. We get there, and we both find a drink we want. Even though Krogers really didn't have anything either. And I was really mad about that, stupid Krogers. I can't wait till you go out of buisness when the new Super Walmart comes. But I buy my chocolate milk and Kyle buys a soda. And then we see someone. Well, we decided we wanted to wait to see this someone again. So we just sit outside the store on our bikes. Well in this time I coudln't get my stupid chocolate milk open. Kyle couldn't either. It wasn't the cap, it was the little sealing they put over it. Well Kyle finally got it open for me and then we see the person come out. Wow, I could sit there all day. Yes I know I'm a loser shut up. But then we ride home, and the way home, we get really lucky. We think it was the bird, we don't know. But it was hott. So we ride around and then Kyle went home. And then I went over to Andrews again, and played Tony Halk with him, and Steffan. Then, I went outside to go home. And there were people standing there. Well they call me over to talk to them. And it happend to be Whitney, Amy, and Amanda (I remembered your name :-) so we talked for about 20 minutes. It was really cool. We just sat outside and talked lol. Then I went home and got online. I talked to alot of people and then KLT called me. This was around 10:30. Well, me and KLT talk for awhile like we usually do. Well we end up talking till 12. And I had to get up at 6:15 the next day. So I got like 6 hours of sleep. Oh well. So I got up today and then got ready, and then went off to a joyous day of summer school. Got to love American Politcal Science Honors. Wow, why did I ever think about taking that!? School in the summer!? It's crazy. I could of just took it during the year, but no, I wanted to get it over with. Man, am I stupid. But actually it wasn't that bad. I was lucky and got Kayla right behind me where I sit, Ryn right beside me, Roxanne diagnole from me, and Bree right in front of me. So I actually got a very good seat in the seating arangment. But the sucky thing is, I already have homework to do. Oh well, I guess getting this class over with is a good thing. Even though I have to be there at 7:30 every morning. I can deal. Well after summer school me and Ryn walked home, I got home and let my dog out. She was going crazy. Then I just have done nothing. I got a blow though to me, someone who I thought was my friend, I guess isn't. They can be that way all they want. Maybe I'm not perfect enough for them. Well I'm glad I'm not. If they can't except me, well then screw them! Well thats really been pretty much all I have done today. But I keep getting annoyed by all these people who have these picturetrail things. They really bug me, once one girl gets them, its like a huge chain of followers. They are the ugliest things ever. Just ditch picture train and make your own thing. It's not that hard. Some things even do it for you. But those things really bug me. Oh well, I bet this things really bugs some of you, oh wait! I know it does because some of you have told me. But good, I hope it does :-) Well time to go!
