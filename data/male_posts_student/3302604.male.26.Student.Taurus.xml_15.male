Still, it's a few more pennies in the old beer kitty. Would rather have been in the sunshine making the most of doing as little as possible though. Still, the best part was that I could laugh at my flatmate's sunburn all evening.  It's amazing how prejudiced people can be. I noticed this at work when every time a bunch of kids come in the shop, if they're wearing caps and/or track suits with dyed blonde hair, he always puts us on security watch. it would do him no end of good just to talk to people as normal human beings for a change and maybe he'd realise they're the same as everyone else. This was compunded by Top Gear. They had Jordan on (who's from Essex and sounds like it) I was quite prepared to watch and listen as she thrashed her way around in a cheap car as i didn't know she was into cars and it was quite interesting and entertaining. My flatmate, however, couldn't get over the fact that she had an annoying accent and wouldn't listen to anything she said. Such is life  If you've got anything to say I will listen no matter who you are  Jack
