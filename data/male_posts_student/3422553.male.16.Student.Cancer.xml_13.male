If you didn't get the memo about this wonderful competition, the event is a band competition where they are judged in several categories based on their performance.  Anyways, the show was really cool.  Went with some friends and had a really good time.  When I first stepped in Blakemore my first thought was "can't wait for football".  The field looked really nice and I can't wait for football to start up.  The only reason I'm looking forward to school is for the sports.  I'm on the journalism staff and newspaper staff so perhaps this will be my excuse to my parents so I can drive to the away games.  That's if I can drive...haven't got my hardship thing in the mail but at this point in time I didn't really expect it back.  Well, I'm going to go see a movie this Saturday with some friends.  The movie is Village.  Looks pretty scary but I'll have a review for you and a rating.  Until then, I'm out!
