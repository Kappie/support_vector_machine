Anyway I can see the results already The unknown Democrat:40% Dubya: 59% George W. Bush: 1% therefore the unknown democrat would win making us one step closer to ousting bush. another good idea is for democrat controlled states to pass laws to stop bush from running PERIOD this would assure the dems victory no matter how much they mess up. Also the greens might do better. So all you left wingers out there remember the code word is Sheer the Shrub GO GO GO... And to all those facists out there I will give you this message: your days are numbered
