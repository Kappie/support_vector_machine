Went down to worcester massachucetts (ooo i spelled it right) for the weekend to see my cousins for their barmitzvah's. i have now been to 4 barmitzvah's in my life time and in yiddish i can even say (unwillingly though just by repitition) blessed is the lord our god, creator of the universe...*sigh* i can't believe i just said that but yeah! ha ha i can speak a bit of hebrew! it was good to see them...although now i do really realise how much i love being canadian. 1: Canadians don't have as much fat people at every single friggin fast food restaurant. 2: Canadians actually have senses of humour and will be nice to you on the street, even for however inane the reason is that you're talking to them. and 3: It doesn't take a terrorist attack killing 2500 people to make them patriotic. but yeah...it was alright...except that when we started to drive away from guelph i could feel the "essence" of emily leaving me... and when i was sick of hearing god this and god that i would think up good ways to start off talking to her on tuesday and i have now picked it...but i'm still wondering if i have to be drunk to get the nerve to do it...no i wouldn't get drunk before doing something as important as that. The worst part about this though is that i couldn't sleep in all the hours driving and trying to sleep in a hotel room. and so now i'm friggin tired, i've had a total of 8 hours of sleep in the past 2 night...i'm tired and tomorrow i think i might study for the science exam...only maybe...but ooh ooh ooh tuesday is the day...(did i already talk about this?) i'm GOING to do this...i have to.
