But roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnations of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens."                         -Moby Dick  Lately, I have been reading Moby Dick. That was an excerpt from what I read today, and I believe I'm going to start every day's entry like that from now on.  Today, for the first time, I took Zoloft. So far, I haven't had any sideffects, but it takes a few days for Zoloft to get in your system. Hopefully, all will be well...  "Whatever my lot, thou has taught me to say, it is well with my soul"
