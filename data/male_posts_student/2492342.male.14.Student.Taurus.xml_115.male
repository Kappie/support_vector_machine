'ne'  ne?  'ne.'  obviously the question wasnt a yes or no answer type. crap. i blew my cover. i mumbled somehting i thought sounded like 'dekuji', thank you, and went to sit and wait as my sister tried on european shoes. enrique was on the radio thing. mhm fun.  i found an awesome jacket, red and black mixy thing, european style, that i REEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY wanted, but psssh it was Kc1900!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thats like 70 80$!!!!!!! holy mother!!!! then a shirt that was Kc700 or so, an ok price, but it was only large. so that was totally fruitless. crap. i have many more days tho.  what to do??????????  im gonna copy this to blog for kicks. its getting long. LIVE WITH IT  much love  peace  ^z^z^alex^z^z^   '
