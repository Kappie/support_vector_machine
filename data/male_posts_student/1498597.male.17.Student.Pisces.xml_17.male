Ok, I guess I am not doing that either. Fuck, I'll have to think of something then...  Lets talk about committment. I probably spelled that wrong, but I don't care. Anyway, everywhere I go, I see lack of  COMMITTMENT.  That's right. People are giving up even before they give things a chance. I can probably name a few instances, but I withhold them to myself. Let's just say, some people drop an activity at the slightest change or chance.  Ok, I don't want to be preachy, but give things a frickin' chance! Now, if you do, like let's say, run for 2 years and don't like it afterwards, you can then quit. But, by quitting within the first two weeks, or maybe three, it makes you look like an noncommittal whore. How do I know this? Well, lets say from experience that I was told I was a "noncommittal boy". And lets return from irony, because you can almost guess who was saying it! If you don't know, oh well, you will really have to think for yourself.   That is this morning's lesson of the day. Before blogging I was fixing  JR 's mistakes. Sorry  JR , just had to get somethings straightened away! Like, there was a double posting and a word was incomplete and yadda yadda yadda.  Let's get personal now. Ha ha ha. So, who reads this investigative journal? (Ok, I really wouldn't call it that, but too bad). If you do read, send an email to nickbrown2k2@earthlink.net..... Then we will see who is really reading this. Over the months, we are going to try to gain new and more readers of the blog!!! :)  Ok, let me use one of   JR's  quotes, "Stick a fork in me, I'm done!!!"  This is  Nick Brown  going away for now, but stay tuned after this commercial break!
