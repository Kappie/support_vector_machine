Friday will be so awesome when I get there! - Laura and I are talking about all of us Senior Board Members waking up really early (a little before/right when they start serving breakfast) and just going in our pyjamas. No shower, nothing. Just us and bedclothes. Of course, we go back to our cabins and get ready to meet LPJ (that's Dr. Laura to  you ) at 8:30, right before our induction. - That's the only thing I have to say right at the moment. Bye!
