By doing this i hope I can make my grammer better.   I thought that maybe I could start off my introducing myself.  I have prepared some questions to ask myself.   What is your Name?  Sean  How old are you?  15  Where and when were you born?  Toronto, Ontario, Canada on April 22, 1989  Where do you currently live?  Camrose, Alberta, Canada   Here are some usersubmitted questions.   Why do you waste your time blogging?  To me blogging is not a waste of time but it does take up alot of your time. I main reason I blog is because I know alot of people are like me and maybe they can find some small interest in reading my blog each day. I second reason I do it is so that I can maybe get better grammer. I have always wanted to be able to be a great writer.   What do you do in the summer time?  Our family owns a store at a Provinal Park. I usually work out there for the entire summer. We have owned it for the past 12 years.   What is your favorite sport?  I favorite sport is hockey. I love to play and watch hockey. The reason I like hockey so much is because it is so fast paced and the intensity is unbeatable. Last ice hockey season I was the captain and leading scorer of my hockey team. About 10 days ago I ended my inline hockey season. Our team was not that good but I still scored many goals! Two weeks ago I tried out for the 2004 Alberta Summer Games zone 4 inline hockey team and made it! I have training camp in two weeks and the acual tournamnet in in about one month.
