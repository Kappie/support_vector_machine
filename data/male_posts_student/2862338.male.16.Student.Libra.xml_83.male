Um, shit, well, Let's see, what else to say....(i'm trying to be all jumpy and funny like my earlier pots, i liked those....) well, right now i'm Listening to ELO (Electric Light Orchestra) - Love is like Oxygen.  Let me just say they have to be one of the best bands ever.  There up there on my 10 ten...well, maybe top 20....w/e, mad good.  On the subject of music, i still don't know if thats what i want to persue.  If it is, i'm going to a SUNY school anyway, but if i don't, i'll prolly go to another school, or atleast try to.  Right now the Only SUNY school's i'm looking into are Oneonta and Purchase...MAYBE fredonia, but i doubt it.  Well, hopefully i decide soon, ya know?  um, well, shit, my "write w/e the hell i want" meter is running low.....ummmmmmmmmm, what could i say to make your littel heads WORK huh??????? hmmm, well, i guess i can say i have a crush on someone right? lol, ya, that'll work..  ya, thats right, you read right.  Some of you know who it is, some of you don't, in either case i ain't saying shit.  Don't even bring it up, it's pointless.  I'll prolly tell SOMEONE, but only someone i can trust it with.  Why so secret?  the reason is as simple as it is stupid...cause i've never really kept my crushes on the Down Low.  simple as that.  well....fuck, let me just give ONE clue.....it's gonna make your heads spin...she goes to antioch.  all i'm revealing, nothing more...........well, maybe one more (see, it's hard for me to keep it secret!!) she's NOT blonde. thats it, thats all, no more, just had to say it, thats all.....NEXT SUBJECT!!!!  hmmmmm,. i need new guitar strings....for all 7 of my guitars.  Well, really, just 5, 2 i don't really play anyway.  On the subject, i really should be playing ALOT more than i am.  As of now, all i do is pick up my acoustic, turn on a song, figure out a good amount of it, then do alittle soloing, and maybe play the lyrical part of the song, then i drop it.  All of 1/2 hour, to 2 hours, and NOT everyday.  I mean, shit, i need to wake up!! i can;t do half the shit i used to be able to do!! but i'll come back.  MAYBE, just MAYBE i'll start taking lessons, MAYBE....we'll see how things go.  On a very, very, very, very serious note, i'm really worried about my mom, but even more worried about my Aunt.  You see, she was going to have a HUGE baby shower, EVERYONE was suppose to come right? well, acouple of weeks ago, she was giving birth, at 7, 8 months.  Now thats not HORRIBLE, i know some people that were born premature, it's ok at that point in the pregnancy, BUT, unfortuantly, she lost her baby....whats worse is, because of it, somethign happened to her blood, and she's using the support thing.  So yeah, my mom has been going CRAZY, she even broke her cell phone from the nervousness.  It's really horrible.  Something even worse happened to someone i know, but i won't mention it just yet.  but yeah, i'm only writing this becuase i really don't know what i should feel right now..  in past evtries i've mentioned that i've never had a death in my life.  And the one's i didi, i barely new the person.  Well, ya, i really don't know what i would do.  All i can do is pray that she'll be alright, cause were suppose to be going on vacation...and i know nothing would be better for my mom than to go on vacation, and to know my aunt will be alright.   ok,...wow, that was a BIG ASS buzzkill, sorry about that.  On another note, who remebers that band Blind Melon? I just DLed No rain, and it's a fucing awsome song i must say......you know what else i must say?  THANK GOOOODDDDD for giving me this taste in music.  I like EVERYTHING, i have TO MUCH, and i'm soooooo happy!! i got influences from everywhere, and i really appreciate it.  I think i like it cause i got this thing with being original.  I don't know why, it's like an obsession, but what ever.    HAHAHAHAA, i feel the need....THE NEED FOR SPEED!!!!    sorry, random pic.  Anyway, i'm listening to Soul Asylum - Runaway Train (good song, DL it!!) and there's this line:       Can you help me remember how to smile? Make it somehow all seem worthwhile How on earth did I get so jaded? Life's mystery seems so faded  I can go where no one else can go I know what no one else knows Here I am just a-drownin' in the rain With a ticket for a runaway train  i dunno, it go to me....it's a very cool song, you gotta listen to it.   hmmmm, what else....        i gotta get those tatoos i've been telling myself about.  Really....i've never wanted one more than i do now..   well, i think i've spent myself....and now, still not telling u who i like...
