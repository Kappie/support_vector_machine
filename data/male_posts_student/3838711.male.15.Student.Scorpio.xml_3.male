Maybe its a time where I should let my inner soul take over me for just this period of time, as I'm writing this, to actually let whatever's out in this heart of mine, to maybe just ease this wretched fellow of his pains for a while. Thats what he always wanted, yes, Peace. It doesnt have to be eternity, nor it be a millennium. Just a while. Maybe at most a hour ? Really... just let him be oblivious to the surroundings, and happy, contented. Minds free from thetroubles that revolve around his life.And maybe its time I sat down, thought hard, and made a decision on what to do next.  I feel so lost now, even lost for words,having argued with my mum about certain things that revolve around the one thing that make people berserk, MONEY. All started about one handphone bill being too costly for the month. And so the madness goes. Its like the third time this damn year. Thoughts and urges of suicide kept flashing through my mind and body, it just makes me wanna jump up from my seat, and just make a beeline for the window. But no, I didnt. And so I just kept on arguing, with no solutions whatsoever. Just going round and round in circles.   Somehow my parents mean good, but expressed it in the wrong way. I can get this when I'm alright and in a collected mood, but when its heated up, I just cant get sober to anything. Damn.. harsh realities in life... is there nothing it has in store... man.. I've got love, studies, and now, money to worry about. This is some big time shit I'm going through man... Just hope everything turns out well soon..  Cried myself out when my mum left the room, kinda felt good and relaxed after that. Couldnt even vaguely remember when was the last time I've cried. So numb to everything, couldnt remember anything. Actually this entry wasnt what its supposed to be, but since I've cooled down, my head became empty and lost. Forgot even what I wanna say just now.  Due to this event, I've decided to see the doc to get a MC tomorrow, to buy myself more time to study for the 3 tests that is bound tomorrow. Physics, Chemistry, and Maths. Killer subs if you dont remember them. Couldnt study now, mood's changed and all, and I couldnt pick up any info from the stacks of notes and worksheets. Hope a good night's sleep will help.  Thats all for today. Peace out. Yes, peace.
