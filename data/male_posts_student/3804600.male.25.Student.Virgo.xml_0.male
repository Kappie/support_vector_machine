I'm a second-year grad student at UCSD in economics working on my PhD.  On the side I would like to get faster on my bike and I'm a bit of a gourmet coffee and wine snob.  Life is too short to drink Maxwell House and Miller Lite.  I'm one of the few Republicans in the department but I'm an equal-opportunity curmudgeon.  It looks like I'll be doing some research in macro in the near future but there's no major hurry yet.  At this point I hope to kick back and enjoy the ride.
