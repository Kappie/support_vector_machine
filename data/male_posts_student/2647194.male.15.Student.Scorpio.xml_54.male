Sorry for not blogging yesterday-I was absolutely beat after this week. Orchestra, 2 concerts, staying up late with homework and crap, jazz band, carting around the school's drum set several times, working on bikes too late at night, and yeah. I was tired as hell.  Thursday latenight: I stayed up until past 11 working on installing a computer on my bikes, checking the tire pressures, maintenance, etc. Got to bed at midnight.  Friday:  Science: survived making a model of a flower out of random junk  Spanish: survived the test with a B  Study hall: worked on that stupid flower model  Social: Took some notes, almost fell asleep  After school:  Choir-almost fell asleep again  After choir, I ran into Amanda on her way to her first real trumpet lesson (the kind you pay for). Took a trip to an ATM nearby to get cash to pay for my "Imaginary Invalid" t-shirt, and bought a well-needed Frapuccino (those are sooo good). I should try drinking coffee more often.  Beyond that, I tried to decide what to do with my evening, and during the process ended up biking around SPP with Dylan, Buddy, and Bill (I think that's who it was), and wound up at Dylan's place. It sure is fun sprinting up Pullman Hill on a bike as fast as the cars. Tiring, but fun when you get a few looks.  I stayed up too late...again. Conan was a re-run, so I don't really know why I stayed up to watch an episode of 3rd Rock from the Sun and eat some pretzels. Either way, I had to get up at 8:30 this morning and go to a drum lesson at 10:00. Already mowed some of the lawn last night, some today, and I still have chores, homework, and stuff to do.  Tonight: I might go to the underground, so if you want to break into my room and ransack the place, then'd be the time to do it. lol. If I don't go, idk what I'll do. It might just be yet another weekend nightlife w/o the life in it.  Oh, plus I watched Super Troopers last night. It was, to say the least, chucklingly entertaining...lol. Kind of a dirty movie though.  I'll just feature the song that's on the radio right now-one of the alltime classics.  "We all came out to Montreux On the Lake Geneva shoreline To make records with a mobile We didn't have much time Frank Zappa and the Mothers Were at the best place around But some stupid with a flare gun Burned the place to the ground Smoke on the water, fire in the sky  They burned down the gambling house It died with an awful sound Funky Claude was running in and out Pulling kids out the ground When it all was over We had to find another place But Swiss time was running out It seemed that we would lose the race Smoke on the water, fire in the sky  We ended up at the Grand Hotel It was empty cold and bare But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside Making our music there With a few red lights and a few old beds We make a place to sweat No matter what we get out of this I know we'll never forget Smoke on the water, fire in the sky Smoke on the water"  -"Smoke on the Water", Deep Purple
