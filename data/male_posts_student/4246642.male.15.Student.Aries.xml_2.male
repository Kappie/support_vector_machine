Dang! :P  Ware wanted us (Simon, Nick, Geoff and I) to be "buddies" with the Japanese students at school, he said we had no choice... I didn't want to, so I just walked out during the little assembly. Phew.   Nick0@The Crossroads says: awww, what's wrong with Trent? When life is gettin' you lonely, you can always go... Ach! Doon-toon says: he's a peacock   That just happened, so I had to include it.  Ummmmm... today our maths teacher didn't show up, so that was totally cool. Except I didn't get to annoy Sian! :  Oh wells, in Science we made like 50 "Teresa-is-short" jokes, so that was good enough for me :P  Okay, anyway, I'm going to go do something else, so ner.  Also, thanks to Jack today for giving me a lift home :D (So I could take my board home too!)  :D :D :D :D
