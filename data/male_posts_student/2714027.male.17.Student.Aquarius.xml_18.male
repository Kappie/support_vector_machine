We did go and buy a new car though, a VW Touran which is a MPV (like a Scenic) for my Dad. My driving lessons are being booked very soon, and we managed to find a cheap-ish way of insuring me. Also wrote up a new press release for Clan Recruiter which I'll release tomorrow morning.  Today I was in town at a Young Enterprise trade fair, helping out on  urlLink my company 's stall. Very tiring, all that standing up - my back is crying out in agony! We looked good on our stall with our colour coordination and display stand, but only made a dismal Â£5, if that, from Valentines cards. There's just not enough love in the world these days.  In between shifts, I took the chance to browse around town, something I rarely do because of the wonders of internet shopping. I went into GAME, where the sale prices nearly tempted me into buying something (I remembered about the game I had to review and the lack of time on my hands). It was also disappointing to see so many copies of  Enter The Matrix  in the 'preowned' section - am I the only person who liked it? Ourprice was closing down and the only stock left was the really crap DVDs and videos that you've never heard of before. I have no idea why they're going out of business, considering the wealth of people round here. Maybe the competition with HMV downstairs was the reason.  Well another week approaches, and that means more work and more stress. I guess I shouldn't really be so pessimistic, considering the millions of people who don't have running water, live in overcrowded and dirty areas, survive on little food and have AOL dial-up. I must learn to look on the bright side of things more.
