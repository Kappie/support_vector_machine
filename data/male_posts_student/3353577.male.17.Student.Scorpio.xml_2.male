All the information I have read states that if you are reasonably fit the 4 day hike can be done without too much difficulty, but I feel like I should prepare a bit especially because of the high altitude that I will be climbing in. I have never been good in high elevations and a few times I actually fainted while on trips with my family to the Rocky Mountains in the USA.  On Sunday I climbed Mount Warning, which is about an hours drive from my house. Mount Warning is an ancient inactive volcano and is also the highest mountain within reasonable distance of my house. My friend Lucas and I started the 8.8km climb (all uphill) at about noon and for the first hour or so it was good fun. The scenery was very tropical and there was a lot of wildlife to be seen. After the first hour, however, it began to get really hard. The trail started out at only a small incline but slowly got steeper and less maintained. When we reached the halfway point I was in a complete sweat but happily surprised that it was a strenuous climb and not something easy.  The trail was almost completely encased in foliage, but it slowly became noticeable through the thinning air and decreasing temperature that we were getting really high up. At one point the foliage opened up to a huge view down the coast of New South Wales and this gave us both a huge burst of energy to finish the climb.  About fifteen minutes later we rounded a corner and a sign reading “The Final Assault” confirmed that we were very near the end. Unfortunately, the last 200m of the climb were by far the hardest. The trail changed suddenly into an extremely steep rock scramble complete with a chain-linked handrail to help us pull ourselves up. This would have been fun in normal conditions, but with my already weary legs and a vaguely familiar feeling of altitude sickness affecting my climbing, it turned into a battle between my mind and body as I forced my legs to climb each step.  Finally, we reached the top. It felt great to finally stand still and absorb the view. A huge amount of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales can be seen from up their and we spent a good 45 minutes up there eating our lunch and looking at the sights.  Coming down seemed to take forever, but it was easier and soon after we were back at the car. My legs were sore for a good two days and I am very glad I went. I think that it is a good mountain for training and hope to be able to climb it about once every 2-3 weeks until I leave for my trip.
