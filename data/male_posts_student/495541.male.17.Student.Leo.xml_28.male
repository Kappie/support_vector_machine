Things just seem to be extremely boring, or depressing.  That makes for some pretty sad moods.  I've been playing a lot of basketball lately.  Oddly enough for it being in the off-season.  I don't like the idea of having that sort of thing in the off-season.  I honesly don't care that much about being competative.  People are now putting too much importance on winning games.  Forget 'having fun' it's about winning.  So you've got conditioning, weigh-lifting, non-practice practices (practice in the off-season is against the rules).  Everything.  I'm getting pretty tired of it.  It could just be due to the fact that lately I'm not really in good moods, but I just don't get much joy in playing when all this is involved.  It gets to be a big bug when you get reminded to go to these 'optional' off-season workout things all the time.  Like I've said before, they're really not optional.  If you never go to them, you have low chances of actually getting to play.  That's wrong I think.  No one cares about my opinion.  It's all about competition.  While staying on the subject of basketball, Saturday a few 9th/10th players and I went to a tournament in Dubuque.  We ened up winning our first game by pretty much a blow out.  We won by 20 or so, if I remember correctly.  The second game we did great in the first half.  Going up against a tough Linn-Mar team, we got beat by 20 or so.  It was a pretty bad second half.  I'm not really mad about it at all.  I really don't care.  Today's song of the day is: "Over" by A Perfect Circle from their first album, Mer De Noms.  It's a pretty good album, I think.  With exception for a few tracks I don't like.  That's all for tonight.  I need to go to bed.  Good night.
