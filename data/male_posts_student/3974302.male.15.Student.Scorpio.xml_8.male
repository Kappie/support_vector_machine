The company, Gameworks, I think it is, would charge us excorbiant amounts of money for the rights to base our story off theirs. So that said, our supplies our exhausted. We have to be completely original to do this, and I have come upon a few ideas to begin with, though if you guys (and gal, oh screw it, you're one of the guys now) come up with others I would be delighted. Think of things that would force us to expand:   Global Warming  Over-Crowding  Disease  Decline of Natural Resources  Radical Expansion, (Where a group of radicals, e.g. Naturalists or Survivalists, Embark to another star system in order to, uh, get away from it all?  Scientific Expansion, (Cold Wars, perhaps?)  War  Alien Life (Please, no aliens. Unless you want to design them, make languages, history, culture, technology, government, clothing, etc.)  Anything else you can come up with   Let your imagination run wild.  Give me a list of 7 or more Ideas  with a short (sentence or two) explanation about them.   "Once we lay the foundation, then we may build the fortress."       -Hephaeustus
