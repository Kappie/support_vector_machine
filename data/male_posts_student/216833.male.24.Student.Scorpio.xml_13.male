I have seen more, learned more, and changed more in the last four months than I have all year.  I really started to expand my worldview more after nine eleven and try to see the world with a different eye.  This led me to a new change in my beliefs on animal rights, corporations, city life, money, health, love, and friendship.  I always loved the urban life, running from street to street and taking it all in.  I still do but there is something different now, I see all these people running around, what for, I find confusion in my new found knowledge.  I don't know about you, but I go through this from time to time like most humans.  What am I doing, why am I here.  Maybe I should help people, but then, maybe not, I need to help myself.  Fuck you and your needs, but this is selfish.  So what am I to do with my time? Should I go through life to make as much money as I can and do all that I can possible dream about?  Sure, why not.    This weekend marks 5 years to the date when I met mimi, Dec 30.  I know that sounds stupid, but that is the day she started work at the Sweet Shop where I was the cook, famous for my perfect Corn Dogs.  haha.  Yeah I made em better than anyone ever.  So they say.  That was a totally different time for me.  I was a very different person 5 years ago, and that is just bizarre to picture in your mind what your were 5 years ago.  I can see myself in my mind, I had this pair of jnco's that were cut off mid-calf.  I still have them, they are in a bag of clothes I'm going to take to goodwill.  I always wore plain white t-shirts and I had a chain wallet, I had hair then and around this time it was bleach blonde and I was still skinny.  Didn't drink then.  Beer did it, that didn't happen for another year.  I was busy, with my fast food job and my bad ass 1972 Chevy pickup.  I had stickers all over the back window of the pickup. Dead Kennedys, supertones, mxpx, the specials, value pac, etc...  I was in between bands at the time, but I had all the equipment to start a band, with my work money I had bought a drum kit, guitar amp, PA, guitars and bass guitars and it was all in my room.  I had a door to the room from the outside, my closet was paneled with cedar and my clothes always smelled so good.  I'm started to feel old, but I'm just glad I can remember sometimes.  Now I'm at the brink of twenty O' two; Happy new year.  What lies in the future is so beyond me that I can't even begin to make a prediction.  I know that the person I am now is the person I think I want to be, it's always that way, but maybe I will become a better person, maybe not as pissed off, maybe I will finish things that I need to finish and move on.  Love you all.
