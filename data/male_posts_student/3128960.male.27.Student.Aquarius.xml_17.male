I was certain the bashful critic was referring to my natural knack for boring to the core of things, for unearthing the structural strictures of 'reality,' for making steady headway against the resistance offered by the hetero-phallogo-normative apparatus of productively power-laden hegemonic discourses, for pulling the rug out from under Ontology himself. "Wow," I thought, "my first fan." I even ran into the bathroom and gave myself hi-five in the mirror.    Then I got back in touch with the real world. I think the very fact that I even take the time to 'blog' is a direct indication of my propensity to (be a) bore. But thanks for reaffirming.   Speaking of something that is assuredly NOT boring, it seems the occult arts are as potent as many an adept thought. Why? Simply stated, Yngwie Malmsteen has been successfully channeled (no, he's not dead, but his career  is (and was always already) dead)into a Finnish neo-classical death-thrash outfit, aptly named the Children of Bodom. Granted, the cacophonous quintet is not new, but as I have had my head up the ass of progressive house for the past 7 years, I have missed some of the stellar non-Nu:Metal acts of the late 90's. CoB fucking rock and have reinvigorated my love of palm-muting, arpeggios, keyboard solos, and Odin.
