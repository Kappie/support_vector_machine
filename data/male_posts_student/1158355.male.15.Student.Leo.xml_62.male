Ok, there's seriously nothing to write about except for I beat Enter The Matrix game and saw the Revolutions trailer they show after you beat it. Wow, I suck, everything is so boring. Ok bye..... WAIT! I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED! I was jumping on the bed doing flips and matrix moves and I gashed my foot on my furniture. It hurt, I gritted my teeth, yelled out loud, then limped to the computer pretending like it didn't happen. My sister told my parents, my parent replied with "That's nice"... yes fun... Ok bye.
