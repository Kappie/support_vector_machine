This is an American artist(don't cringe just yet) doing a sort of 'behind the scenes' of the going-ons of Sandman Volume IV, 'Season of Mists', my third favorite volume. Specifically, it chronicles what the female cast, Death, Delirium, and Despair are up to. This book is short, fluffy and thematically has nothing in common with the much more dark Sandman, but is an absolutely cutesy book, with absolutely adorable renditions of the whole main cast. This is all done by Jill Thompson, who did art for the original series, I just don't remember what she did other than "Lil Sandman", in book 6.   Secondly, I also read volume one of "Gravitation", a cute shonen-ai book. This is very different from the anime, but it still is a cheap gay romance comic. It's cute but lacks any real substance. I love it.
