I spend 4 hours a day on an average on the telephone. Besides I work and study. So I am busy. But this is not new. I have probably had a similar schedule for the last 2 years. What is new is that I am actually enjoying it. And the reason that I am doing so is that the only girl that I have ever loved is back in my life after many years.  I will let you know the details in my next post. My boss just walked in and I have to run. HAPPY NEW YEAR again...
