Full-time report:- LATVIA         1-2         CZECH REPUBLIC '45 Verpakovskis           '74 Baros                            '85 Heinz ::The Czechs were lucky. ::The Latvians defended well until Baros scored at the 74th min.They were kind of demoralized by the goal. ::Baros scored from a goal scramble.The corner came into the box and was poorly cleared and Baros took advantage by chesting it and ramming it into the goal. ::Then came the decisive moment.At the 85th minute came a corner then it was another goalmouth scramble.Then there was another poor clearance and when the goalkeeper ran back to his goalposts,Heniz blasted a shot near the top corner and that sealed the Latvians' fate.  Conclusion:Well,the scoreline isn't surprising so the Czechs have a headstart to their Euro campaign but they have to finish their chances when given as they had 26 shots but only 2 goals.The Germans' and the Dutch's defence is tighter and the Czechs will have lesser shots so the Czechs have to be wary of that.The Latvians,well i thought they came here as extras but they showed that they're not that easy to beat after all as the Czechs have to fight hard to get the well-earned three points.Congratulations to the plucky Latvians who at least put up a good fight.  _::signin' off:UrCh!n::_
