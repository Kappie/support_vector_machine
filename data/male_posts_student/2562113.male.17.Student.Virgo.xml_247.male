So I've been waiting all spring for a bad thunderstorm and yesterday my wishes were fulfilled. Around 4pm there was a wicked storm.....crazy lightning, high winds, hail....the whole deal. This time, a lightning bolt struck the trees on the next block, followed by one of the most deafening thunder rumbles I've ever heard. BK just informed me that his house was struck yesterday and his computer gave off beams of light during the strike. INSANE!!!!!  Wednesday morning I will be driving down to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to visit Justin at his school! It's 700 miles each way, about 10-12 hours driving. It's a LONG trip to do on your own but I have a feeling that it will be well worth it! Can't wait!!!  ...I'll be back Sunday, hopefully. See you all then!  -BIGsmut
