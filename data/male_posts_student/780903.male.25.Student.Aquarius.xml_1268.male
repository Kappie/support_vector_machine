"Yeah, but this shouldn't be too bad." "Okay.  What's the client number?" "It's not for a client.  It's for me.  I'm selling my kids." "Excuse me?" "I'm selling my kids.  No time to deal with them." "Oh." "So why don't you draft something and then bring it by my office, okay?" "Okay, great.  I'll come by when I've got something."

PAYMENT  Buyer shall be responsible to Seller for any loss or damage to Seller by reason of any failure or default on the part of Buyer to obtain the love of the three children, and follow all laws in connection with the State of New York as regard the treatment of children.  Also, Seller will not pay for private school, ballet lessons, or a puppy.  4.

REMEDIES OF BUYER UPON SELLER'S DEFAULT  Seller shall, without limitation, be in default of this Agreement if Seller shall feel guilty about the transaction and attempt to cancel, or if Seller's wife finds out and stops these shenanigans.  Seller shall not be in default for nonperformance due to fire, natural disaster, acts or defaults of common carriers, divorce, or other cause beyond the reasonable control of Seller.   7. REMEDIES OF SELLER UPON BUYER'S DEFAULT  Buyer shall, without limitation, be in default of this Agreement if Buyer shall fail to make any payment to Seller when due under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller; but the Buyer shall not be in default if the children destroy his house and stain the furniture.  8.
