Great read, this crazy guy, after previously circling the globe on a motorcycle, builds a custom Mercedes and drive 115,000 odd miles over the globe with his wife (yikes! I have trouble driving with my wife to Toledo).  He does this to gauge various global markets from the ground and find investment oppurtunities and to check up on his investments from previous trips.  Along the way he spouts his rhetoric about investing, about the various economic conditions of parts of the world, and in the end sums up the "future" of the American economy in relation to the world.  Great mix of travel and economic insight.    Jim Rogers co-created the Quantum Fund with Gearge Soros back in the day, the fund increased by 4000% while the S increased around 50%, so the guy knows a bit about this stuff.  Anyway, interesting read, if only to learn how one goes about driving through central Africa.
