But thanks to the links I found in  urlLink this forum  I got me an email account at  urlLink spymac.com  where it is now  urlLink opgeven@spymac.com   It gives you a 1 gig email account, 350 MB combined storage for your pics/mp3s/etc, and a personal blog. It also has a forum, a gallery, and auctions.  And it has webhosting for $9.99.   You can send up to 100mb attachments I think, maybe it's 10mb.  I dunno, but it's enough to send a song or two, along with gigantic bitmaps of screen shots, so that's good i guess.
