That grotesque twisting of reality, designed specificly to embarass me and frighten small children? Well, it has been shown. I had my head under my arms for the whole showing. From what I heard, it received good reviews.  With my brain thoroughly burnt from all that mental torture, I did the only thing any standard idiot would do: finish the mind-bending book I started a couple weeks ago, "God and the Philosophers." Without question, it was the most difficult book I've read...ever. I find it funny that in several of the testimonies the philospophers described a book about philosophy they would read in their youth and only vaguely understand. The book had an interesting twist at the end. The last two testimonies were from Jewish philosophers. An interesting move, I'd say. I wasn't sure how to react to someone of a radically different faith than I, but surprisingly their views were very close to mine. This kind of opened a little window in the world of another's spiritual world I could only begin to imagine. It was fun.
