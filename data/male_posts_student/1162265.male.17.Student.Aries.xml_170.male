Great enough to make me really consider my weekend plans, party or the concert?  I just don't know.  But yeah, fun day.    Then Max Payne2 as well.... So much goodness.  It's ironic that I can still have this core of badness eating away at my soul regardless.  Proves a point, that happiness really is relative.  If you have less, it's easier to become happy.
