Except now it has a hat. It's a cool hat. Fits the character well.  Look for him in the video, he moves like the exact same way as I imagined, but now he's in a green pasture... although the light seems not to affect him.  Thistler is one of the great flash artists- he realized that flash movies are not only stupid stick figure movies and useless violence, but an actual art form. Now, if I could draw, i'd be on the same level. When I made GSET(greatest story ever told) in Flash, I used a stick figure because it was mostly an experiment to see what I could do in flash. Also, I can't draw. :(  Anyway, it rained today on the bus drive home, carolyn pointed and laughed at me from the bus when i got off...  When the bus takes me to it's first stop, i actually pass BY my house, and no matter how many times i ask her when we have to stop right next to it, she says no. So, I have to turn around and head back, which SUCKS because I was soaked by the time I got back to my house. I hope my laptop's okay.  That reminds me... I need to get Mr. Reyes to give me back my flash stuff from last year... hmm...
