I've had it for over a day now, and it already is my favorite web-based email client.  And, because nobody bothers to email me, I'm just going to give out my new temporary Gmail account: shoxx5@gmail.com.  Eventually it will be thebagel05@gmail.com, but, I have to wait until I have my invites come in.  I send one to myself, and give the rest away as part of the bagel.tech giveaway.  So, for other stuff.  Here's what's been going on.  Hmmm.  Well.  This is interesting.  NOTHING!  Yep.  When I called EB today to make sure they were selling Spiderman 2, since today is the official release date, they told me that they weren't.  They said that they had them, but they would not sell them until tomorrow.  Even though the packaging clearly states, "DO NOT SELL UNTIL 6/29."  So, I have to wait until tomorrow to get that.  And it's going to be sometime around 11:00 tomorrow morning, so all of the bagel.tech updates are probably going to be moved to tomorrow night, depending on what time I go to get it.    So, with me not having anything to do today, I just kind of hanged around and watched some TV.  I have yet another headache (so its probably a good thing that I didn't go and get the game today), and I've been popping pills (Tylenol) since around 9 this morning.  I don't know why I keep getting them, but, they just keep coming and coming, and coming.    A few of you may remember me talking to you about dying my hair orange red.  Well, I haven't done it yet, but, I probably will tomorrow.  I think it would be a good change, others don't, but, I think it would be awesome.  I've been looking to do something different, and that just might be it.  But, we'll see.  Maybe it would be too different, but, I don't know yet.  Depends on my mood tomorrow.  Remember that show Rocko's Modern Life?  That show was the best!  Join me later tonight as I reminisce about my favorite 10 episodes of Rocko.  Since I haev nothing better to do, anyway.  Until then, bagel.tech has some sweet new updates today, and new information about the Gmail giveaway.  So go check that out, and my next post for the night will be sometime around 11 or 11:30.
