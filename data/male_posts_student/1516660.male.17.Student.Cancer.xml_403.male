The storyline is so addicting! Okay right.  Today I left home extra early to deposit my moolah into my bank account via the Cash Deposit Machine at CCK MRT Station. Okay. I see there's no line, so I rushed there. I immediately took out my card and was just about to insert it when I looked up and saw the words "This machine is temporary out of service"! Why must this happen to me! So dao mei leh! When I want to deposit somemore! I said "ayiah!" and the people queueing in the ATM queue looked at me. So paiseh!   Sigh. This term in Chem Prac, we started doing QA. Eee. I hate QA. Have to memorize a lot of things. Also have to do a lot of tests too. So er xin. Sigh.   Okay. I found out how much I got for my Physics MCQ. It is...11/25. Sigh. Not even pass by 45% Die le la. Dao mei leh! So unlucky!  Okay. After Physics is choir. This is a rather informal practice session. Heh Heh. After that, we went back home lor.  Okay. I received news that only 9 passed GP in our class. Parvi sure pass de. They are spectaculating that I will pass. I doubt so. I can scrape through for essay, but for comprehension, it was a total stab in the dark while answering questions. I anyhow do one!! How can pass like that? Unless my essay mark is very high, which again, I doubt so. Sigh.   Okay la. I log off le. See ya next time. TaTa! Night blog!
