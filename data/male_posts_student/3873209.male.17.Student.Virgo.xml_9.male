I really want to get people to come into this blog but i think they have a really high filter on so i can't get to them so easily. This is really a good way to share how he feel and how we're going spiritually. I mean I can truthfully tell you that I'm not going that well. But I'm starting to pick it back up again I'm starting to feel the energy and love that God has given me to give others again and so I shall start my term very happily.  I believe that any put together with God = 100% goodness. Sometimes we stumble, so wat! If it was in God's will that we stumble, then so be it! I've stumbled this time along with you Fi, this time. And I'm glad to do so coz at least we know that we will 4eva be there 4 each other. The more we go through, the stronger our friendship will be. Ming, I'm not leaving you out of this. This ain't just girl talk! This applies to all of us... Hmmm... just need others to come in first lol...  Thx for being who you are, so let us be 4evafriends.
