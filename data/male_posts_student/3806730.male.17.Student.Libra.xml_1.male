Had three classes only, and I was dismissed early from laboratory coz the lights were out so we couldn't program in our computers.  I am feeling much, much better, by the way :)  In a few minutes, I'm off to PE practice, we have a practical exam tomorrow.  My PE this sem's ballroom dancing.. man, nahiya naman ako.  I wanted to cancel it on the day of enrollment, but it required such a tedious process (exag) so I decided I'll bear with it for the rest of the sem anyway. Sayang naman daw, binigay na sakin yung PE.  It isn't so bad after all.. since I enjoy dancing anyway.  We're doing American waltz right now, so things are still going fine.
