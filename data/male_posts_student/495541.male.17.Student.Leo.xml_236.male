I plan on taking more pictures in the future.  I've got a lot of work if I want to set up my photos on this page.  Maybe this weekend I should sit down and go through them all and post the ones I like.  I don't have homework this weekend, so there's no problem with that.  Probably Saturday night or Sunday I'll end up working on it.  That should be interesting.  I have no idea how I should categorize my photos.  I wanted to get software to organize them.  I saw a Microsoft product to do just that, but I think it is a hundred bucks.  I'm really paranoid about spending money now.  I'm really dedicated to getting my car.  That brings me to another thought.  SRT-4 sounds funny when you say it, I think.  I think I should come up with a name for my car when I get it.  Call me obsessed but it's like giving birth to a baby.  Sp I need name ideas!  Comment them for me.  Blah blah blah.  Finals tomorrow.  I don't know how that's going to go.  Then I have basketball too.  In the morning and in the afternoon is when I have practice.  I need some sleep.
