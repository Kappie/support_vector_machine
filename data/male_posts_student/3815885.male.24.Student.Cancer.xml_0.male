Also, i went out and looked at this sweet house with a few of my friends were really interested in it - only problem is we need like $1000 for a security deposit and were all frickin college students so that is unlikely to happen if you know what i mean. My friend ashley and i were talking today and she said this really cool quote although she's not sure where she heard it :    Relationships are like sand, the tighter you hold them the more they slip through your fingers, the less you squeeze them the more it stays intact  she's sooo smart.
