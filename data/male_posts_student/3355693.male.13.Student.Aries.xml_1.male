We played  punch-buggy, this really  old  game  from  6th  grade. Rules  are: when  you see a buggy you can  punch  the  person and say no punch back so she doesn't punch you. The fun part was when we passed by a car dealer, they  only had buggies. It was funny, we stayed punching the fuck out of each other inside the car, lol. Well, when we got to the mall we went to Hot  Topic. We stayed in there for about one hour and Soraya bought a jacket,a  wristband, and a shirt. The jacket was really cool, I‘m  going to buy  one  for  me  next  Saturday, Soraya’s mom was horrified with the patch Soraya  bought to put on the jacket. It was a blink 182 skull. So, only four more  days until the shit is over. Oh, I can’t wait until the 27th, I’m  going  to the beach for five days. I'm going to chill out a bit, I will tell you  more about it when I get back.
