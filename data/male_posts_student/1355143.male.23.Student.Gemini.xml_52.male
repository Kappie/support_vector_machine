The thing why I writing this to you is that I saw one picture ( urlLink this one ). This guy looks seriously too much like one of our Italian foreign exchange students ( urlLink here ). I have to say even though I got a second opinion I have been known to see people who are completely different as "lookalikes". The guy on his right would be called tjokkó (choko). This is one of Icelands best known  urlLink chokko´s   Well later, Úlli
