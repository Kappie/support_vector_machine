Terry Semel, CEO of Yahoo has made a $25 million donation to UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute, and it will be renamed the Semel Neuropsychiatric Institute. $25 million... now the question is how much of that money will actually be used for research and how much of it will be used to do even more construction on the campus.  On a separate note, it makes no sense to me that any school or institute can be named after whoever gave it a lot of money. Take the UCLA Geffen School of Medicine for example... David Geffen has nothing whatsoever to do with medicine. The guy was a producer and just happened to have a lot of money he wanted to give away... what does it say about a profession when a school can be named after someone who has made no intellectual contribution to the profession itself?
