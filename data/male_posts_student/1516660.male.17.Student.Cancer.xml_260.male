In the afternoon, I am going to Wendy's house to play MahJong. My mother wants me to bring kum over, but I don't want. It would be kinda embarrassing, a child giving kum. Heh. It was raining and raining, but the rain stopped at 1 something. I then met Su Ping and we went to Wendy's house together.  When we arrived, Wendy was already playing with her colleagues and Kai Lun. HaHa. I saw lots of kum (brought by her colleagues) on the table. Even Ping brought kum. I was so like, paiseh for not bringing kum. Even auntie asked me (jokingly? I think so) why I didn't bring kum. So paiseh.  We then play MahJong (after her colleagues stopped playing). Woah. We play and play and playu. I won quite a number of times. Heh heh. Wen play ar play ar, until 4+. Kelvin, John, Jin Hong and Fong Wee came. The first time FW did was to interfere with my game. I was playing my own style one leh, until he came and arranged my tiles for me. He teach me like I am a complete idiot at MahJong like that leh. I feel so vexed. I want to play using my own style, and I know how to play lor. I got so flustered until I forgot to 'pong'. Ergh! Even Wendy's mother told them "You leave Kekvin alone la. The more you teach him, the more confused he becomes". Thanks Auntie! I think Su Ping also understands la. She don't really like playing with them around.   Me and Su Ping left at 6 something and we walked back. (Oh yes, thanks Wendy for letting me come your house and play! I enjoyed myself, expeically when playing with your mother. Heh Heh. :D Oh yes, I got $4 from Auntie. Xie xie!) I got home to a very angry Mother (because I said I would be back by 6 and I came home at 7). I met my Dad at the lift. His car was in an accident, because he knocked into a metal barrier. Something like that la. I only got sketchy details, because he won't tell me much.   It looks like Mom and brother waited for me and Dad to get home. We ate dinner and watched One Leg Kicking. I spotted Siva Choy (Oh, he's a very funny bi-weekly columnist of TNP on Sunday. There's a photo of him everytime. Some of my favorite columnists are Raymond Goh, Jason Hahn and Edwin Yeo. Heh Heh.), but I wasn't sure it was him until I saw the credits. Heh Heh. The movie's nice. :D Although I don't like football much, I love the storyline. Moo meow!!   After that, I went online, but did not blog, because I was too tired to. HeHe. Well, I went offline at 11+ (after recharging my handphone).    TODAY   HaHa. Today leh, we went to Mrs Chua's house. All of us met at 9.30, but as usual, a lot of cats came late. e set off at about 10, I think. We are taking 965 till the end of TPE. Me and Ji sat together. Gloria sat opposite us and we talked about a lot of things la (me and Ji listened to his Superstar). We got off at the end of TPE and took bus 83 at the opposite. We stopped about 3 stops later, and we were lost. HaHa. After some searching we located her house.  As usual, I didn't bring kum. A lot brought, but some didn't. Heng ar, I am not the extra. Woah! Her house was spacious! Hers was an Executive flat. so many rooms. There's even a green room, which we all suspected was the room for the baby (future baby anyway). Her husband, Chriz, was quite cute. He's very quiet though. Initially, we were quite shy one. We milled about and don't dare to walk about. Mrs Chua brought her wedding photos out. Woah! She looks very beautiful leh! I especially love her in the blue gown! So elegant! She can have different kinds of facial expression de. Sad, love, happy and funny. All kinds! (Hann hear le hor will feel very jealous!) Her husband was also very handsome in his suit(s). One of their symbols of love was a pair plushie of Mickey and Minnie. It signifies them being born in the year of the rat (they are 32 this year). So special. The plushies are sitting on a bench somewhere in the house.   After a while, they decided to play BlackJack (with money of course). At first, Mrs Chua don't allow one, but when she saw, she dont' really cared. I didn't play though. HeHe, partly due to me having no money (I even forgot to ask for lunch money from my Mother. I have to borrow from CQ), and partly due to me having bad experience with gambling (for details, refer to the blog on 1st January, or somewhere around there). I watched Ji play. He lost $16 in total. Only Kelvin Lim won. Heh Heh.   After playing, we decided to go eat lunch, Mrs Chua joined us for lunch. She took us to Compass Point to eat KFC. Me, Ji, WQ and Gloria shared a family meal. O.o We all ate and talked lor. At the end, Hann called. I let him talk to Mrs Chua. Heh Heh. At least he still can talk to her ma. Not so bad right? Heh Heh. We bade farewell to Mrs Chua. It has been an enjoyable experience at her house and with her company. HeHe. (She gave $4 hongbao money. Thanks!).   We took a double-decker bus to Woodlands Interchange. We are going to Jacintha's house to play MahJong/cards. We refers to me, WQ, CQ, Joyce, PY, GaoLuan, JunJie, Gloria and SuPing. HaHa. Now Joyce 'lent' me her orangers to bai nian. HeHe. After some milling about, we started to play. Me, JJ, GL, PY and SP played MahJong. I only won twice. HeHe. I also gambled with the rest for BlackJack. I initially won some (I played 10 cents), but lost all my coins (50 cents) in the end. Heh. Some people are coming back to Jacintha's house for more MahJong tomorrow. (And yes, Auntie gave us $4 also. Thanks!)  Me and Gloria went home at 6.30+ because of the heavy rain. I have to record Simpsons. I also recorded CardCaptor Sakura Movie 2. YaY! I am planning to watch them on Monday, after watching Gloden Globe Awards. :D I ate my dinner and watched a movie on Channel U, Her Fatal Ways 4, starring Carol Cheng. Actually, I didn't know it was her, until Dad told me so. The movie's so nice! I want to see the other 3!! Meow meow meow!   Ar, here I am online.  Hmm, today's a very nice day (save for the rain). Well, I gotta get going now. A busy day is ahead (not really) of me tomorrow. Well, see ya tomorrow. Night blog!
