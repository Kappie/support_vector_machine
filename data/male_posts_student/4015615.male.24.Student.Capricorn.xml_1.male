This time, I visited my lady'shomein Brooklyn, NYsince her mom was out of town and it would be a great opportunity to make out with no one to hassle us.   What's more, a Japanese touring companycame to Lincoln Center toperform an adaptation of Haruki Murakami's, The Elephant Vanishes. Murakami is my favorite author and non-English word to say besides "fongule" so when my lady surprised me with tickets to this show I surprised her with a hickey the size of Kansas.   Theplay itself was beyond description; the director who was British, somehow captured Murakami's blend of the mundane with the insanebyputting onvisuallymagnificent play. It was all in Japanese with English super-titles butwhat makes Murakami so great is that his themes can transcend the sometimes superficial East/West culture differences. I didn't get up to wizz once, and those who know me can attest to the impressiveness of thisfeat.   We finished off the evening with dinner at a fancy downtown eatery and some Die Another Day on cable. All in all it was a lovely day.   That night, however, my lady and I waged another battle of wills in the bed. For weeks I had been kidding herwith the inevitable fact that someday, probably someday soon, one of us would fartwhile asleepand the other would be awake to hear it. Now, regardless of the fact that girls don't flatulate or poop, this situation seemed to cause my lady some concern. I reassured her that with my high fiber, no-nonsense diet that I would, in fact, be the first one to break the olfactory/aural silence. Regardless, we've both been sleeping less and waking up more often lately and that night when I woke at 6 for another wazz she has migrated into a differentroom in the apartment.   I know a girl who trained her boyfriend to leave the room ANYTIME he had to fart. Even at night. Then again, my father says that the true test ofa relationship is subjecting someone to the Dutch Oven after drinking a couple beers. I promise I'll let everyone know when the cease fire is ended.   Lastly,while walking out of my lady's father's apartment I noticed a small wooden scroll type thing nailed on the doorframe. I askedif this was a Jewish doorbell. Shescoffed at myWasp/Wopignorance and corrected me by saying it was a Mizuzala (sp?). OK, now I love the Chosen People and all but where are these words coming from? I swear they make them up on the spot to confuse us and then laugh about it in their world-financial headquarters 50 miles under the earth's surface.   Keep it comin', sucka!!!
