I remember the first time I saw it was when I was on the USS Belleau Wood and this other corpsman was like, "you have never seen Super Troopers"????? As if it was a crime. I realize now that it is a crime not to see this movie!!!!!  I am going to work today. I got a lot of people overthere hooked on making websites; you can do a lot with the free yahoo web site account. Now its non-stop. Hey Rob can you take a look at this file for my web site, hey Rob how do I edit this part of my web site...etc...etc. Its actually kinda funny but it can be tasking sometimes when 2 people are in the room both editing their web sites and both asking me questions about them.   July 4th. Its my uncles b-day and my other uncles b-day is on the 9th so I have to spend more money and get people presents! I think I will make a couple cool CD's for them and then get them some lottery tickets. What can I do??? I am poor.
