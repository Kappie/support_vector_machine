The last book in the Belasarius series (there is another coming soon of course).  Still shaping up to be a fairly entertaining piece of work, but some of the characters are starting to wear a little.  Of you read David Eddings' Belgariad, you know what I mean.  It starts to degenerate into a parody, but not quite as bad as Eddings.
