He got up at around 10:30 on his own and then he did some laundry and planned out his day a little.  Jew got some tennis games going and Tyke joined in.  He hadn't played tennis in quite a long time though so he knew he wouldn't be very good.  But at around 3 he joined up with Macaroon, K-caj, Jew, Amed, and a few others for some tennis antics.  It was pretty hot out it seemed to Tyke even though it was only mid-70s.  But Tyke is used to the low to mid 60s so this was a very pleasant change.  And it was mostly sunny with few clouds so that was a change as well.  The tennis was fun.  In singles Tyke beat Macaroon in a best of 5 games series by winning the last game after a few deuces.  It was really a good matchup.  Both sides had unforced errors but Tyke was able to play off of Macaroon's pretty well.  Then in doubles Tyke and Macaroon played K-caj's team and gave them a pretty good run for their money.  K-caj actually plays tennis so he was of course good.  But Tyke's team started playing well for a while on the last game but they still lost.  During the tennis matches Tyke got a call from Purdy and they chatted for a few minutes and made plans for tomorrow so that gave Tyke an extra little boost for the next matchup Tyke had.  They won that one.  After tennis though Tyke went down with the gang to South Cove beach and they had a nice swim and fun on the dock.  It sure did feel great being in the water.  He hasn't been in the lake in months.  After that Tyke went home and had a nice American meal.  Barbequed hamburgers, corn on the cob, and potato salad (although Tyke doesn't actually like that).  Then Tyke did some laundry and helped out some before setting up a little get together later on.  Tyke was joined by Kinker, K-caj, Macaroon, and later on Amed.  They played Risk and Tyke ended up winning after taking over every single country on the globe.  He really played extremely well.  He didn't make a single move wrong.  It was domination at its finest.  Now Tyke is going to go to bed, get up early, retrieve the mail from the post office, try to set up a checking account, and then hang out with Purdy.  It's looking to be a really great day.  Here's to the night (good song but no meaning here).
