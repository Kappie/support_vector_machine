My dear Alvin, could you please kindly cut your nails as soon as possible?  *Sigh* But actually, I feel like a witch with long fingernails with the power to have black magical energy contained within me, and with the ability to cast curses etc. Maybe I'm a witch~~=/  PW is so troublesome...especially when blunders have been made...with the wrong date specified etc. And it is none other than a period where you can learn to fake results, and eventually fake your written report as well. (I learned to fake my survey results too...kinda' a greenhorn at such skills of deception~~! =/)  Haiyo! See  lah ! I've already sidetracked from my blog entry proper to some rubbish written above. What was I supposed to say earlier on? Oh yes...while sitting somewhere to expel the shit from my system or better known as egestion in biological terms, I was reminded of the crazy moments in first 3 months SRJC of 2004...especially when the first intake were rather nice too...with the retainees very friendly to us intakees as well.   On a beautiful Thursday morning, all the classes had gathered at the parade ground, from 1A01 to 1A07,and from1S01 to 1S24, preparing to be led by their CT away to their new classes. But alas! The tutors had told us to attend our venue of first tutorial/lecuture by ourselves which caused a great furore amongst us. It was kinda' funny too 'cause we weren't very used to the new system of self-initiation, which is to be used to the system whereby our secondary school teacher would bring us back to our classrooms shortly after morning assembly or silent reading period there.      Quite nostalgic, ain't it? It was quite a boring and lame joke...but the feeling was there if you had been a 1st intake SRJC student. At the moment, SRJC is filled with weirder people who do not have the warmth of the intakees. (Most of us either fled to TJ, CJ, TPJor VJ etc. I was an exception....flew off to YJ instead of entering 'proper' JCs meant for my kind of character.)   Okay, enough of such rubbish already. Let's simply hope for the best in the future...while I miss my SRJC friends who are mostly in TPJ at the current moment. T_T~!
