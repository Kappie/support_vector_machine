     
      "Now when I think of that broken-hearted fall, I'd give my all to have that moment      to speak again, to thank you for chasing a bluer sky--and to kiss again--      and to say goodbye...  Moments live in forever once they live, so we can give away our forever day, and it's no regret to say, 'that was yesterday' when we give away our forever day...  Time to say goodbye, to see what time can bring to love, It's time for me to try to see what life is really of, It's time to say goodbye..."  "Time to Say Goodbye" - music by J. Zawinul, Lyrics by K. Elling
