I love blogging, but I can only seem to be extremely negative when I do it. So I'm stopping. I love ya'll, but I felt totally alienated last night. and it doesn't help when I can't seem to stop offending my girlfriend. I love you Kaya, and I'm sorry for everything I've said and done. Please forgive me. No more beating around the bush. From now on, all that I complain about here, will go out in the open, when neccesary. But most of it wasn't neccesary, so don't think I'm going to be constantly complaining. Again, I love you kaya....please forgive me. ~Elan
