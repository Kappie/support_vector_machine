These people end up making millions of dollars and becoming famous. It's called the American Dream, isn't it? The American Dream is that noble cause that everyone is supposed to follow, that "Work hard and anyone, even you make a name for yourself" philosophy that everyone has.  The truth is that the American Dream is just that, a dream. Like almost every dream, this one is unattainable. The American Dream is a false philosophy. No matter how hard you work, there's a great possibility that you will be left behind in the wake of the people who will step on you to move up.  In this country, the hardest workers are usually the ones who are continually left behind. Take a look at the class of people called "Blue Collar." These are the good ol' boys, the coal miners, the farmers, and the people who put in a good day's work every day, and collect a modest paycheck at the end of the week. You look at the "White Collar" folks, and you'll see a great contrast. The rich people are getting richer, and they're doing less and less work. People in the top of the big companies that make everything "easier" for us are the ones that mainly just sit at home and watch TV, or just go out and play golf on their own private course on one of their islands in the Carribean. They are the lazy ones that make humanity so incredibly disgusting. Yes, it is easier to find the bad points in people than the good ones, but when you look at people as a hole, you won't see the good ones that hold up the rest of them. No, you'll only see the "creme de la creme," the ones who are standing on top of everyone else.  So, where's all this going? Where is this rant on the unfairness of American life headed? This isn't a post that I just ran off. I've been thinking about this for quite some time now, and the only way I can think of educating the masses is through my writing. All I'm trying to say is that it matters none whether you work yourself to the bone or just fuck off your whole life, you'll end up under six feet of dirt anyway.  Bottom Line:  The American Dream: Work hard and you can make your dreams come true. The American Reality: Work hard and get left behind and stepped upon your whole life.
