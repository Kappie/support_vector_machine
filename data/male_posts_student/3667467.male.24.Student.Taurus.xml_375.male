They work fine, but who wants to download something that won't convert to a basic format like .mp3 or .wav?  I understand the importance of protecting copyrighted material, but it seriously compromises the value of the material.  In the time spent searching for decent songs to buy--rare tracks, the ones I'd think to be beneficial for both parties--I could have downloaded ten times the material for free as a standard audio file.  They've got a while to go before digital music is universally playable, and therefore economically viable.
