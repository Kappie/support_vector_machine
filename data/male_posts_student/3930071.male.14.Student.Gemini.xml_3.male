Anyways I get back from my trip and the next morning guess whats on the front page of the Miami Herald, a headline saying Ricky Williams retures. Now a week after the Heat gets Shaq and Miami is looking like one of the best sports citys in the country, Ricky Williams trys to mess it all up. He has always been a pretty weird guy, but retiring in the middle of his prime. Things were looking good for the Dolphins until today, now were stuck with Travis Minor. Ricky Williams can go to werever he is going in Asia and leave us alone. Thanks for ruining the fun Ricky.
