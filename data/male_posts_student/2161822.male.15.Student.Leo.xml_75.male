So basically for the next couple weeks I'll be glued to the television watching basketball game after basketball game. But that's what I love about basketball. So I got this recording software for my computer. With some fancy mixing and cheap skills I'm able to record myself and make me sound somewhat good at guitar. I also think it's necessary to give props to a certain Ashley Sabol for burning me a very good CD. But she's too good for us now and left for New York for 5 days. Pfft. Hmm nothing else really happend since the freaking snow is preventing me from doing much of anything. My sledding experiences haven't been too successful. It was basically me and Neil jumping on an innertube and sliding forward for about 3 seconds then coming to a dead stop. Yeah Hazleton doesn't have too many good hills. Plus now all the snow is crappy slush and black ice. So snow football would be  ice  football. Which hurts pretty badly. (Refer yourself to previous posts to understand what I mean) I say the snow should melt and be no more. Well I've been saying this the past few days.  Listen to H.I.M. and Trapt
