Well, I guess now  Blogger  is allowin' us to title our blog entries...it comes a little short of the title  "Technological Advance of the Century" , but hey...we can put titles on our blogs now!  Whoop-dee-fuckin'-doo!  Anyway, whats goin' on today?  I'm sure most of our readers (yes all  five  or  six  of them!)  are goin' to  registration  today.  Now, you see,  registration  is this thing where students you know, register for school and stuff like that.  I thought I would explain in case someone didn't understand what  registration  is.  Its excitin', but also very off-putting.  You see,  registration  is like a  road sign  on  the highway of summer vacation .  It means... "School year ahead...next exit, a week and some odd days."   Yes, its true, a brand spankin' new school year is approachin'.  I can barely contain my excitement.  Oh, can't you just hear the joy in my voice, the happiness in my laughter?  Ugh...school is startin'....NOOOOOOO!  On to more important subjects...Nothin' seems to be goin' on with the site...not that I know of...I guess you'll just havta wait and see or somethin'...  I guess there is one thing that I guess has valid importance...Did you check out those gas prices lately?  I mean, OK, so I don't have a car...alright, so I can't drive (legally muahahaha!).  But its just another way our 'rents and siblings (if you have any) will havta spend money.  It must suck for them...and for us soon too, since most of us are enterin' the appropriate age for drivin'.  I'll check up on that story, see what caused the gas prices to rise faster than some old dude who overdosed on  Viagra .  Haven't really been watchin' the news lately...been lookin' in the paper for  shows  and the readin' the stories about the  X Games ...Did anybody go?  I wish I did...My sister,  Stacie's , boyfriend  Ryan  went.  The lucky bastard!  Anyway...thats it for now.  I guess I'll go update the  P.R.E.
