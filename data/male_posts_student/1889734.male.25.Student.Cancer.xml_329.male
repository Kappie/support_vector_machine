I've spouted off on my anger at spending, so that's nothing new.  Now Bush is trying to react to the decay his numbers are seeing amongst conservatives.  I'm sure most conservatives will end up sticking with him due to the terror issue, but this is really too late to do any good.  He just said in the SOTU that he was looking at a 4% increase across the board.  To suddenly switch like this is a Karl Rove inspired move.  Good politics I guess, but it sends a muddled message to those that are paying attention.  Look for a 1% growth to be portrayed as a cut.  The Dems will trot our starving children, homeless, unemployed and so on, trying to illustrate the cruelty of only spending $2.4 trillion dollars in the coming year.  How can we get by on only $6 billion a day in this nation!    Think about that number.  There are 275 million Americans.  Your annual share of the federal budget is $8700 per year.  Of course, only half of us actually pay any federal taxes, to the true burden on those that pay is more likely in the $15,000 range.  And that doesn't include state and local income tax, property tax, gas tax, sales tax, tolls, registration fees, and so on.    Here's an intresting site showing 1997 numbers for state and local taxes.  Take Ohio for an example since most of you are in this area.  Ohio collects $1467 per year per person in various taxes.  That means a family of four pays $6400 in these taxes.  http://www.ncsl.org/programs/fiscal/sltxlvls/STpCap97.htm  Ohio collected another $692 per person in property taxes, so our family of four paid nearly $2800.    So on average, $9200 to the state and $8700 to the feds.  $1500 a month consumed in taxes.  And we haven't talked about Social Security and Medicaire deductions yet.  Remember this when it is time to talk about other people's 'need' for your money.  Remember it when they parade the children out on stage who can't even add, or don't know that we are a Republic.
