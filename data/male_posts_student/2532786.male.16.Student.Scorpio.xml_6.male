The problem is:  a) I am to lazy to get one b) Everywhere I have asked isn't accepting job applications at the moment  I'm going down to the job centre tomorrow to see if I can get a job involving what I do best. Computing. I would look on their website but the crappy Job search won't work on Macs. Damn websites.
