Well, praise the lords tt I managed to catch a cab and got to school on time, if not I'll probably be swearing rite now. L0L!  The first period of the day was English. I was the first to be selected to present the first 3 answers to the class. -.=" Well, b4 I could started crapping, the teacher gave a scolding to those who did not do their work. It was kindda sad, especially when the poor lil' pig and fat pussy cat were among those ppl. Well, but they obviously couldn't be bothered. Haha. See, I care so much bout' my brothers unlike them! Hmmph~!  E Maths was pretty quiet, the ppl frm 4E4 weren't around as they went for the health screening. So it was pretty slack as well. Physics was after that and I couldn't understand tt chapter. I had a hard time paying attention as well. Haha. After recess was Social Studies for 2 periods. It was slack, all we needed to do was get into grps and write some stuff bout' Venice. Chinese was next, but obviously I wasn't paying attention at all. He was basically talking nonsense and wasting time. After tt he made us do our own work. Wad a lazy teacher man! Not as if I care anyway! L0L!  The last period was assembly in the hall. We watched some realli stupid cartoon, tt was Lame wif a capital L. A total waste of time. I went to haf lunch at the hawker centre wif Malbindar after school. We had focus at 2:30pm till 4:30pm. So we had to haf a quick lunch and rushed back to school as quickly as possible. We were onli like 5mins late.  About half the class didnt go, not surprised at all. L0L! Among those tt didnt go was lil' piggy~ Man is he lazy! L0L! I dunnoe, probably had tuition or something, well hopefully it was tuition. How could he skipped focus!? L0L! Not as if it would help out a lot attending focus. Haha. I managed to concentrate for onli like half an hour. After tt was juz slackin, talkin and wastin time.   Fat pussy cat was mean as usual! He was pulling my hair and tucking the collar of my shirt! L0L! He still said tt I was the mean one. Why? Cuz I call him a fat pussy cat. Let's see, he calls me a white stick, a P.O.W, a Skinny Stubborn Stick and many more, so who is more mean? He said I didnt tell him stuff tt I tell Mal and Hongyue. Well, tt's not cuz I'm mean or dun trust him. I juz cuz tt recently, it seems to me tt he doesn't wanna mix wif me or something and I can't find time to tell him stuff too cuz it seems to me tt he's not interested. Well, he oso said tt I was mean as I treat him in a veri bad manner. I didnt haf anything to say after tt. Honestly, in the whole cls, I treat him the betta than most ppl. I care for him and love him as a brother, and apparently he still said tt I was mean towards me. *Sighz* Wad a F.P.C!  After fat pussy cat was tired of pulling my hair and tucking my collar, he went on to stroke me. -.=" Well, it may sound gay, but he looked so damn adorable and sincere while he was doing tt. Juz like a caring and loving lil' bro(about time eh?) Haha. Tt's wad I call Brotherly Love! Wahahaha! I dun think it's a bad thing, I actually think it's a good thing as long as it doesn't turn into some gay act. L0L!   After focus both of us were walkin juz outside the 4th storey toilet. When I realised my hair had been contaminated due to the pulling from tt fat pussy cat, I started to say some stuff. As u all shld noe by now, fat pussy cat is onli good in giving stupid comments and tt's exactly wad he did. I stared at him at first den approached him and put my arm around his neck. I intended to strangle tt lil' !@#$%^, but b4 I knew it, my legs were off the ground! Damnit!   Tt fat pussy cat actually lifted me off the ground! OMG! He used 1 arm to support my head and the other to support my legs. Man was I shocked cuz I didn't expect tt kindda shitz to happen! It's either 1. He's strong or 2. I'm light. Well, if u picked option 1, I must tell u politely to use ur brains, as u all noe he's F-A-T! Now wad does F-A-T means? Yea, basically FAT! If u picked option 2, u haf brains man! But dun get it wrong. Light stands for thin, but not skinny alrite! Nah, juz kidding. I hafta admit tt he's strong ya! (so dun say I nvr write good thing bout' u! cuz I juz did!) The bad thing was tt once he lifted me up, he refused to put me down. He was carrying me and walkin all the way to the stairs. Luckily nobody was around, cuz it's Embarrassing wif a capital E! It made me look like a weakling, as if I'm so weak till I can't walk. -.=" Well, as u all noe, I'm Neo, the 1, so somehow I managed to get out of the situation and kept a distance frm tt dangerous fat pussy cat!  Tt fat pussy cat forced me to take a cab home. As u all noe, I'm a veri nice person unlike SOME ppl, so I agreed without much hesitation. He kept calling me "Brother Bear" while we were waitin for the cab. I haf no idea why he did so too, yes he's my lil' bro. But a bear? Well, I think he's more suitable to be the bear as he's as around as 1. L0L! In the cab, he said tt he couldn't pay as he was saving money to buy a pair of soccer boots. I told him "I buy for u la." den he said as he was alighting frm the cab "I tell u frm MSN tonite." Well, he didn't say anything. So tt's juz too bad, my offer to him is now officially over. L0L! I was supposed to treat him to lunch today as well due to some deal, but luckily I sneaked away. So technically I dun owe him any treats anymore! Yay! L0L! Alrite den, PEACE my brother! =P~~~ Tt's bout' it for the happenings today, cya! =]
