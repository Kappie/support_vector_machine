My thoughts were sparked as I watched television this morning. A commercial for a speed reading program that can supposedly increase my reading speed to a level allowing me to finish reading the daily paper in one sitting created a doubt in my mind of my iminent reading prowess when they stated that with the purchase of the training program is included an ILLUSTRATED classic, Orson G. Wells' "The Time Machine". Such an apt choice for the new readers joining the ranks of the speed literates. Maybe their computer training can allow them to speed peruse the pictures. I'm sure they'll be of the highest quality and detail to challenge the advanced minds of today's speed readers. Or at least those that decided it would be a good idea to learn to read from a television commercial. And that's not the only stupid problem " Eye Q" made in their product. They made a literature library on the computer, so you can read at your leisure while promoting cancer of the eye and causing unexpected spurts of blood from your eyesockets as you attempt to finish a modicum of text with your new training.  What the CRAP people?!
