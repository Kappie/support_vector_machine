I'm sure that when I get to get it, all my friends has gone through it and is bragging of how easy it is, and how unrealistic and bad it is. Some games are worth to buy, games that I've heard of many years now, games that takes out all my computer power, those are the games that is worthy to install on my computer. And also, doom3 has Linux support ;) Native gaming support is a must, just to bad that Hl2 isn't getting it, or B :I'll hope that game developers start to release their games with full OpenGL support and Linux and Mac support. And I'll hope that Microsoft releases DirectX source, and makes fully implemented support for Linux.
