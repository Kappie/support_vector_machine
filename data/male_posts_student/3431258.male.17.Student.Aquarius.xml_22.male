I wanted to install  Pandoras Tomorrow  but computers were all full, so we waited for 15 minutes. When we got computers, noticed there was no cd on mine, so i just played  Command  Conquer Generals . Slow computer, took 10 minutes to load the first map, anyway the game was ugly. After that i booted  Cs , it was the wrong version and it jammed, got out of there and met my mother in the street, we went with 2 of my brothers to a restaurant. Went back home and here i am!   Yeah, so 7 days before  Canada , can't wait to be there. Also, we are moving soon!   Made up my mind and i will buy  Homeworld II  if i have the chance in Canada, it's top innovation and deserve to be played a lot.   Well, i'll probably update a bit later, just wanted to cover the 3-days i did'nt.   Oh and if you see no update, it may be because we will have our internet connexion disconnected by  Telefonica , since we are moving and stuff. So basically, if it happens, expect the next update the 9th in the afternoon.  Regards,  Zephyr
