There is no good way to introduce the story, so I'll simply jump into it...  I got home from work last night at about 9:45 pm. I was very hungry, but also feeling particularly lazy, as I had been up since 6 o'clock in the morning. After haplessly surveying the contents of the refrigerator and pantry, I almost resigned myself to not eating anything -- not because I wasn't hungry anymore, but because I was feeling so lazy that I didn't want to make any effort in securing any provisional sustenance... I didn't want to cook, I didn't want to drive anywhere, I just wanted to sit on my ass and have food brought to me. Normally, one calls for a pizza in this instance, but I didn't want to pay for anything, either.  It was around this time that I overheard my roommate and his lady-friend discussing the ins-and-outs of procuring a delivered pizza. I wayfared my way into his room to become part of the action. They informed me directly that they planned on getting a pizza -- and I supported them in their decision. Covertly, I planned on sticking around... getting a slice or two. They made the call, made the order, and hung up the phone. Estimated time of arrival was 45 minutes. I realized that I was going to have to commit 45 minutes of absolutely awesome company if I hoped to receive food... one cannot just drop in on a pizza and hope to get in on it... it requires some sort of investment.  The following 45 minute period was among the most exciting and entertaining comedy shows I have ever put on in my entire life. I talked myself into losing situations where I allowed myself to look like an idiot, so that they could feel cool. I made funny faces, and even danced for laughs. And I will say so falt-out, I was funny. I was really fucking funny, and there were a few times I actually thought, "they'd better give me some pizza, because I am putting on a great fucking show here."  Eventually, the pizza arrived... as did the moment of truth. Would I be fed?  Yes, I would. The two of them actually seemed to compete over whose slices I could eat. He said, "you can have one of my slices", and she corrected him, matter-of-factly, "no, you can have either of our slices". I obliged them both... and I think I ate more of that pizza than either of them.  Then it hit me like a ton of bricks... all those old nature documentaries I used to watch that described the social dynamics of monkeys... some monkeys were bullies, and fought for food; some monkeys were foragers, and found their food. But there was always that one monkey, and there was a monkey like it in every group of monkeys, no matter where they came from. The narrator of the show could never understand the behavior of this monkey, and its name was always "Bonzo" or "Fifi" or something else insipid... and it was the monkey that sat around and entertained other monkeys, and swindled the food they fought or worked for right from under their noses.  These monkeys were the dick monkeys... the monkeys that were dicks.  I'm a dick monkey.  This realization came to me while I was still sitting there, eating. I couldn't stop laughing about it. I had this image in my head of two monkeys sitting around eating bananas, just kind of shooting the shit, when up comes another monkey. You can tell by the look on this monkey's face that he's up to no good, but the two other monkeys don't seem to notice -- then the new monkey starts to act silly, the two monkeys laugh, and start giving him bananas... I pondered the comedy that no group of monkeys seems to think that they have a dick monkey, that the dick monkey is some sort of covert ops position in the primate social hierarchy... and sometimes, such as in my case, not even the dick monkey knows they're the dick monkey.  They seemed to think that I was laughing about something else, and god bless them for it, because they cannot know the truth. I actually sat there a little bit longer than I was planning to because I felt guilty about the whole thing -- guilty about tricking them into exchanging food for my company, guilty about being the dick monkey.  It's the next day now, and I don't feel so bad anymore. It's probably part of my genetics.
