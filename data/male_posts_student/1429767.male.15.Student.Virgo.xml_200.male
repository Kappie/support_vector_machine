When I graduate high school and finish college, hopefully University of Michigan, I think I want to either move to Southern California or northern is just as good or New York City. I'm tired of the small town atmosphere, I need people all over the place, strange people that you don't know and people you can be someone else around them. I would try and be myself most of the time but everyonce in a while you have to mess with people I would think, but you have to be careful about who you mess with and all. So anyway I'm extremely bored and those sleeping pills are kicking in but I'm not dont posting yet so :p! Josh is gettting DSL that really sucks! I want it so bad but of course, It doesn't come out to my house. He got a really nice Linksys wireless and ethernet DSL router, its 80211.G so that means it has decent bandwidth and distance. That is going to rock, you can take the laptop out on the deck underneath the awning and talk to people, now that would be the life. I love to talk to people sometimes, they are really cool some of them anyway. You never know who you will meet on the net and become friends with, you can find some pervs out there too, like if you go into a gay chat room on Yahoo with your webcam on people will say give me a show or something, so I just hit the good ol' block button if they just want sex but if they are just horny and are actually a good person, I'll say no but give them another chance at it. The Warped Tour is only 5 days away now, not counting today, and as you are aware I'm pysched, it will be so awesome to finally meet Simple Plan, they are the best band in the world as seen through my eyes. There are some other bands though that have gotten my attention like Story of the Year, Breaking Benjamin, Coheed and Cambria, Army of Freshmen, Matchbook Romance, and Sugarcult just to name a few, I'm hoping to get some of their music here pretty soon, I'm dying for some new music, the same 1,800 songs get to you after a while! I was supposed to go to Venetian Fest with Eric today but dumbass me didn't remember until it was too late and I ended up staying at Josh's house the day instead, so yeah there I go again... Well I guess the sleeping pills are REALLY kicking in so I'm off to bed here directly, right after Unaffected by Hoobastank of course, oh, and Kaitlyn I need to talk to you... again so hurry back from where ever you are as of late!      Here's a good quote...     After all, not to create only, or found only, but to bring perhaps from afar what is already founded, to give it your own identity, average, limitless, free. --Walt Whitman--    Think about that, and you won't be so boring perhaps... Just kidding, but yeah that is a good quote I thought!
