BUT all we see is the stupid road. so basically they were fooling around with us. o_0 then when they did it the 2nd and 3rd time nana still fell for it!! haha i didn't! clever me =] well then the stupid thing was that i wanted to take bus out of NUS so it's easier for my mummy to pick me up. however my mum ended up driving in to pick me up because the stupid bus just didn't appear for close to 40 mins. heh wonder how long more they waited after i left. oh well looking back up to what i wrote it doesn't sound as funny as i thought it was, but i think it is one of those things that you must be there to be able to understand. heh so anyway this is my entry of the day. do your homework people. =]
