YOU WILL NOT BE COMING BACK TO CLASS. for about five blissfully ignorant seconds, i was pondering what it exactly was i was needed for. then it hit like a load of bricks. i knew by the note's obvious urgency that my grandma had finally lost her struggle with alzheimer's. and i made my way down to the office and saw my uncle through the crack between the door and its hinge. his expression just confirmed my thoughts... i probably never forget the moment i knew what had happened. i really thought i was prepared for this to happen for the past 7 years. what a joke that was. when i got to the house it just destroyed me. for sure i will never forget that moment with my other uncle. under the saddest of terms, there was solace from him. even though i knew it would come it was still so incredibly hard.   today everyone was more than accompanying. my friends are really great. hryb was so nice and gentle with the whole situation. tom checked on how i was doing. brittany and christine were cool about things too... last night when i was with amber she did a great job of making me forget about bad things for a while. i felt a lot better with her near. (before i forget, she talked about katie and kelly's concern. that was nice to hear.) if you read this, thanks so much amber for doing all that.   it feels a lot better knowing everything now and talking (typing) about this stuff. hopefully i will be able to forget the pain, but i won't ever forget the great reasons that made her so much of a loss.  i won't forget...
