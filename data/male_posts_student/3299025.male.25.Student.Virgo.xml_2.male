Dr. Paisner is a little and intimidating man, who seems to be quite a good psychiatrist, but does not seem to be someone whose bad side you'd like to get on. There is definite potential for the ADT here, but I haven't seen it yet, so...so far so good.  We started out this Friday talking to a couple of patients who were recovering from opiate addiction, either heroin or some other form of opiate. For those of you not blessed with a $200,000 medical education, the moral of the story is that all opiates basically turn out to be the same drug in the body. Heroin, Morphine, Codeine, Oxycontin,  Percodan, Dilaudid, Demerol, Vicodin....these are all the same damn thing, really. Little twists and turns that make each slightly different in the way it makes you feel, but that's about it. So what you might see with opiate addiction can range from street heroin to people addicted to prescribed pain medications (the main clinical use for any of these drugs). And what's too bad about these drugs is that they are so very addictive. They give a great amount of pleasure, and the withdrawal is every bit as dramatic, if not more dramatic, than you see in the movies.  So we meet up with Dr. Paisner at 10:30. Of course, Dan and David, two of my classmates, were late because, one of the opiate-addicted patients they were talking to began crying uncontrollably. "10:30 is 10:30," Dr. Paisner greeted them sternly. They explained that they were comforting a distressed patient, but Dr. Paisner repeated his stern warning: "10:30 is 10:30".  We talked to some more patients, some who did not believe they were addicted to opiates, others who are glad to be out from under the horse. Apparently, after 5 days free from your opiate drug of choice, day six you are CLEAN. Otherwise, withdrawal is so terrible that you either want to die or take more of the drug, to stave off the withdrawal. Miles Davis apparently locked himself in a shack for a week to clean himself up from heroin. And then he did that funky perm thing to his hair. Ah well. They did say he was never the same after that...  Anyways, to hear real people involved in these extremely dramatic tales, which I once believed were the province of Nancy Reagan-era "War on Drugs" scare movies is pretty sobering, no pun intended. Successful people, people with dreams, people with lots of potential and opportunity -- unfortunately, with this drug, most of them are addicted for life. Plus you have a possible co-morbidity (medical term for catching two diseases at once) with some psychiatric disorder, which we also learn is one of the main reasons people develop drug habits in the first place. So, you have this chronic psychiatric disorder, and you take this highly addictive drug to stave off the anxiety you feel due to your disorder, and well, it's just a recipe for trouble.  We took a break from the dramatics to have a cozy lunch on the roof of our building. Until over the loudspeaker, we hear "Code Blue, third floor, ITU". Um...I haven't watched very many episodes of ER, but that's a big one. So all of the doctors rush downstairs to see what was going on; apparently, one of our patients had managed to sneak some heroin into the facility, and had overdosed to the point of him or her not breathing. As medical students whose first rotation is psychiatry, no experience or anything, we just sat tight and stayed out of the way. When the other doctors returned they sorta glared at us with shame. Elizabeth, one of the residents, pulled us over, and gave us a mildly exasperated reminder that we are medical students and we should run to Code Blues as well. "It's a valuable learning experience, and there are probably things that we could do to help."  Recalling that I was unsure just a few minutes before which bone was the radius and which was the ulna, I was highly doubtful of that fact.  At first, we didn't think anyone minded, but we received a lot of passive aggressive comments the rest of the day about how we were big scaredy cats. I simply didn't know whether I was wanted. And it's not that we were needed; the person began breathing again, and all was good. Still, there was a chilly air surrounding the med students the rest of the day. I frankly didn't feel guilty at all, and I like to think that God was on our side, as He made it rain into Dr. Paisner's top-down convertible.  I worked through the pain by drinking myself into a pitiful, blubbering stupor later that evening, trying to drag compatriots of mine to Berlin. I  probably had one of my worst hangovers ever, and while I don't know whether my body was trying to help me sympathize with the opiate addicts, or punishing me for not running at the Code Blue, or whether God was punishing me for snickering just a little at the Doctor's ruined leather interiors,  I couldn't help but feeling like locking myself up in my apartment like Miles Davis until the music came back. And it didn't until Sunday.  P.S. I did manage to win a bet with Cara Rabik's sister, though. Hangover or not, that gorgeous girl owes me ten bucks.
