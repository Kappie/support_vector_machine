So *** you snargles   April 8 I changed it so there ARE line breaks, you hardly use this ne way Boo, so :P  ~Rei  March I am encouraging people to post here as a Group Blog.  If you know anyone who would like to post (preferably someone some, if not most, of us know) then please e-mail me with information.  Emerson, please type your blog titles in the Title Bar, it made a small annoyance when I was doing layout.  OH!
