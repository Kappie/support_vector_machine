Read the bottom paragraph about how the rankings can be read - they are on a scale of 1 - 150 (1 best, 150 worst). San francisco is  the most  expensive place to live (150). San Jose is right after it (149) and New York isn't far behind (146). San Jose also ranked dead last (150) for job growth, with San Fran not too far behind (145).   If that doesn't make you want to move to the bay area, I don't know what will.
