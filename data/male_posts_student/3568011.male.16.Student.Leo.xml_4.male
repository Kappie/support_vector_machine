Back to my blog, I decided to add some images as soon as I find some. By the way I'm developing my first web page, so I'll put a link to it when I publish it on the net. I'm also creating a new game,kind of short and basic but it's great! It's called "Poyo's first adventure", the main character is the Poyo, looking a kind of pink bubblegum, with cute black eyes and an eversmiling mouth, that can ransform into many poyo species. That's all for now, I'll try to post more in future.
