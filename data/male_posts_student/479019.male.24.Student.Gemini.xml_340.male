I prepared for myself honeybbq chicken, green beans with crushed red pepper, and rice. The rice was steamed with seasame oil, garlic, and ginger... to give it some zing. Dessert is a chocolate bar... from a nice young lady... a damn good meal wouldn't you say?  Damn I'm smoove... for myself anyway... I think I'll treat myself to a DVD as well! Oceans 11 it is!  ****
