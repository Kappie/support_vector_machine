Maybe because my dad doesnt want me to play Soccer this year, Im sure if i said I wanted to play Golf he would be all over that!? His excuss was that My algebra grade was chronicly damaged? And my response to this "Then I guess I can sit in my room all summer?" and then my dad blows off steam with "Get yourself back here smartass!" And as for my mom? She makes to many promises, and is not so optimistic,at all!? Goodnight...
