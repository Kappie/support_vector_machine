Combine that with having MITY all day (which is fun, but a lot of time), there's not much time left to do anything. I had about 5 minutes last night to post. When I get home at 4:30 or so today, I have to mow a lawn, then have music lessons.  I've gone from having 10.5 hours of sleep per night to having less than 8 per night, and more stuff happening. Not too great.  Cailin (guy in Journalism) "ditched" (couldn't find all of us) the rest of the people who were playing Trivial Pursuit. Thus, I lost. Horribly. Each other team of 3 had 3 chips, and I had 1. 1 on 3 on 3 isn't easy, and to make it tougher, one of the 3 key players on the "Brain" team last year (Whitney) was on the DNA team, playing against me. Hopefully I'll do better in the geo-bee, and won't be the only one in it.  Also, I went from having 1 article in the MITY paper on both Monday and Tuesday, to having 3 articles in today's paper. I doubt I'll be able to do 3 articles per day.  A little bit of news: The MN legislature may agree to vote on, and even pass a new law outlawing smoking in all public workplaces, restaurants, and even those smoky sports bars. It'd be about time for that to happen.
