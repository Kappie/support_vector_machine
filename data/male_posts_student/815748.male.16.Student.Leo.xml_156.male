Loren thought NSC-68 was a conference, and he got so many badly wrong answers on his interro.  Sorry Duke, but dude.  I feel kind of bad about how I act regarding Jessica Li.  She's a good girl.  Yesterday I turned in a movie-note sheet to Ms. Heidlage on which I had written a quotation.  I'm trying to remember it.  Oh yeah.   The Cold War was fought in a narrow tunnel. --- Eric Messinger     I'm also thinking of seeing a movie over the week, since we'll barely have any homework because of MCAS, maybe "Bon Voyage."  It's French and at a good theater that we can walk to without an adult.  And with the "we" here I'm thinking Loren, but it could be any of you people or others who don't read it.  Like Dan Jung.  Ok so get back to me on that.  Everyone likes my story, except Jason, who can go suck a lemon.  Which are actually good so Jason can go suck a prune for his laxative problems.  And Julia said that it was "good for a sophomore."  Oh, and I wrote my election speech for S-G of MUN.  Even though my chances aren't good, that doesn't mean you shouldn't vote for me; it won't be any better if Dan Asher wins by ten votes instead of by eleven, and you know that I would be a cool S-G.  Gabe says part of my speech is bad; I like it.  And that goshforsaken essay; at least when I'm done I'll have like one significant assignment left for the rest of the year.    Alex : So anyways, Ben... wait Ben is your name, right?  Ben : [thumbs up]  Alex : I'm sorry; Ben is such a generic name.  Ben : It is a generic name.  It also means "right hand of God."
