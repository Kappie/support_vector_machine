I want to hang out with other social misfits and eat cheetohs and drink mountain dew and crack jokes about Star Trek:TNG that people actually laugh at.  I want to roll dice and flip pages and consider whether it's better to shoot first, or hide in the shadows while the fighters and barbarians take the first attack.  Is that so wrong?
