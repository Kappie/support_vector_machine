I was a young boy and he was a few years older than me. We met in a pub and in a dark corner we got acquainted. It was dark so nobody could see us. I'm trying to keep my blog about pg-13 so I'll stop there.   I get to interview one of my favorite voice actors. He is the Voice of Cyborg 009 and he is Zero from Pilot Candidate. His voice is awesome. I also got to interview Chris Patton, the voice of Yushiro Gowa from Gasaraki. You can check out my interviews at  urlLink http://www.dbgt.com .   I guess Benny is not for me. I've tried all my tricks and nothings happened. All Well. I just hope I get with somebody before I turn 16. I don't want to lose my virginity at an older age.   My sister is having another baby. This time its a boy. Shes had two girls already, she had her first one when she was like 16. Luckily, I dont have to worry about getting a women pregnant. :D. I hate children though, so it really doesn't matter to me.   I found out I'm gonna have to wait like 18 months before we move to LA(louisiana). Which would mean I would start in my senior year. I don't think I'm gonna stay at my high school until 11th grade and leave. I might as well just stay through all of high school.  I might get lucky when I go back to NY in a couple weeks and start soccer. There's a boy in soccer who I like, his name is Mike. He's a year older than me but he looks like he's 13. He acts a little gay and is sorta girlish, so thats a plus.   Case Closed rules!! TTYL
