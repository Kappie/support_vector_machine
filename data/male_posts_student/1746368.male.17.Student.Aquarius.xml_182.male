I know exactly how you feel, it's happened to me as well. A long time ago, a friend of mine died.. He was unjustly murdered by some who didn't understand him. My friend died saving my life. Those who killed him wanted me dead instead. My friend stepped in and took my place. He died instead of me! Before this friend came into my life I was in bad shape. I was lonely and wretched, lost and forgotten. After I met this friend, I learned that he died protecting me after.       If you have ever missed somebody so much that you felt nothing could replace that emptiness, remember my friend. Sometimes I break down crying because of his sacrifice. Nobody can replace that hole he made except him. After all, he is God's only Son, Jesus.
