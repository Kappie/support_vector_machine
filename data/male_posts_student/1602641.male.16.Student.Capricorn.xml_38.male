It finally ended a whopping eleven scenes after I thought that it should have. After the third or fourth ending, I felt like I was being punished for something, or else just being reminded that I'm Peter Jackson's bitch. Otherwise, Golem was awesome, the orc leader boar a striking resemblence to Yoda, and the best part of the movie was undoubtedly when Legolas kills the elephant (It still only counts for 1), second up is when the evil dude catches on fire and runs off the cliff.
