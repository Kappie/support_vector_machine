I'm glad that's finalised. Something else I can cross off my list.  Was a little worried that I'd have to get new photos done because when I went in to hand in the form the bearded lady (I shit you not, she had a beard!!) behind the counter was making a bit of a kerfuffle about the photo being too far away and that my head didn't fill up the whole photo.   Yeah, fuck you too bitch. Bring it on.  All I have to do now is finish up my CV, get a JP signed copy of my passport, get 2 references from teachers that I've worked with (on school-headed stationery), a JP signed copy of my qualifications (uni degree etc etc), proof of address (front page of a bill or something), and fill out the registration pack.  Already have the police check. Just as I thought, no criminal thingamees against my name. I'm as clean as a whistle. So does that make me a good guy or just plain boring?  Anyways, once I get those done and sent off to Global Ed I'll have me a job at the end of the year. Oh yeah. Mind you, that hasn't stopped them from ringing me up last week and offering me 5 full-time teaching positions in England already. Starting in September. One problem fellas, I don't finish my course til the end of November...
