Everytime I see that guy, I get irritated because the guy is sometimes so arrogant and brash about issues. He argues that Germany owes the US for all that has happened since WWII; therefore, Germany owes the US military support in case of an invasion. I swear that's fucked up. Here's the truth. Military action... especially the invasion of a country like Iraq, who's people have been starving thanks to UN sanctions is not going to simple. People will die. Billions of dollars will be spent on weapons. Thus having social and economic implications. Then once you oust Hussein, what do you do? What about the social and economic situation of Iraq after such an invasion. There are so many issues at hand. I'm no military or political politician, but any student of history knows that it's not that simple to invade Iraq, oust Saddam Hussein, and then have peace. O'Reilly over simplifies the issue and knowing how dumb many people in the public are, it creates a jingoistic / militant atmosphere that simply isn't cool.  *
