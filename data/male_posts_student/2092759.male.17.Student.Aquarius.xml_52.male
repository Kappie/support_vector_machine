This may seem alittle self-absorbed and egotistical, but I swear, the devine spark of creation that influenced mathematicians was granted purley to make me pull my fucking hair out. I am going to be throughly happy when my class is over on thursday, and I wont have to touch the shit for a year. (Assuming I get off my ass, buckle down and do my freakin homework)
