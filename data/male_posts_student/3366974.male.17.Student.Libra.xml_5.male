Actually, I was outside a lot today.  Yesterday, as stated in my previous post, I met a girl who was apparently interested me. Well, I decided that this time, I would go to town and be prepared. So, when I awoke, I did all the usual things one would do. I even shaved, despite the fact that I loathe it. I took a drive uptown to see what was going on, and to my dismay, nothing. After killing some time, I went back uptown where I met up with some friends. We rode around town for a while, and then the girls came back outside. I talked to them, but only breifly. Laura, was going with her cousins to the Military Mess Hall. Why her cousin would even need to go there, I don't know. My friends and I played basketball not too far from there, I won the first three games before finally getting tiped out in the fourth one. I was hoping to talk to Laura some more before she left, but that didn't happen. I saw them leaving a while later, and I decided I'd try to get her email, assuming she has one, or her phone number from her cousin sometime. A thunder storm was upon us though, so I'll have to wait until tommorow, or the next day.  My past few posts have failed to mention my progress with Zoloft. So far, besides an itch here or there, and some other symptoms that very well may be sinus related, I haven't noticed any sideffects, except perhaps an upset stomach. Which, odly enough, never seems to bother me in the day, only at night. As you can imagine, that makes it quite uncomfortable when your trying to get some sleep. We'll see what happens in the coming days.
