It has been 9 months since I last been to a trip organised by the school. Here are some of the pictures showing the Form Ones, Twos and Threes busy chatting with friends while waiting for the buses to arrive.            ~ Went back home by taxi today. for the first time in my life, the taxi-driver's a lady. She was friendly and considerate. After getting into the car, she asked me which radio station I would like to listen too. She said that she has Hitz, Mix and others. Cool.   The second half of the day should be cool as I'm attending the Prom Night.  Lolz..  I'll report on that later. Hopefully something stupid will happen.
