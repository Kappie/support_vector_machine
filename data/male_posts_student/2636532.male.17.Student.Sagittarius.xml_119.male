But anyway I'm standing here, in my spare that I have every other morning in the  library in front of this p.o.s computer that my school forces us to use and I thought, hey why not blog? I mean I don't even have to have anything to say, I could just go along a stream of consciousness shit like that. So anyway, This next couple of months are going to be pretty big for me, April 1st my brother moves out and into the city, which is really good, it means that I will no longer be kept awake or woken up by the sound of my brother fucking his girlfriend, cuz his room is directly beneath mine, and she is very noisy, and my bro knows this but it raises a very good point, he asked me would I rather hear her moaning and groaning or him grunting and yellin' out "oh ya ride big papa daddy!!!!!" but anyways, he moves out April 1st and then I have the house to myself for the most part until I graduate, and then on July 1st I move in with my brother cuz my parents got us the apartment, really sweet deal cuz as long as I'm going to school they'll pay my rent, we actually worked it out and it's cheaper to get me and my bro an apartment than it is to get both of us vehicles, plus the fact that I still don't even have my learners license but that's a moot point. So ya, I move in on Canada Day and I have made it clear to my brother in no uncertain terms that when I am home, he will not be fucking his girlfriend, if I'm not at home, then that's cool but not in my bed or I told him to his face that I would beat him to death with my gap wedge. So ya I know I kinda went off on a tangent there but hey, it's stream of consciousness, what can ya do?
