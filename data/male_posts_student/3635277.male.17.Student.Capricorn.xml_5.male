Anyways, its monday today.... which ment back so school to start the A2 already. I was dreading the lessons, but i was secretly really REALLY happy sitting in the common room at lunch. Its times like that today that remind me just why im scraping through and staying there. I love that room.And the people in it! (no im not drunk.... i just have a lot of fun there)  Anyways, the title of this blog is referring to what happened at work a few hours ago. I got in and they told me that over Â£270 was missing from my till on saturday. and all i could think was "Holy crap... they think ive stolen from them." They say that then dont think it was my fault, that it could be a computing error or something. but damn, how else could it have not worked?  blerg,.....  Anyways, it looks like were going camping on saturday night, in honour of Sarah Marlows birthday. It should be a great laugh, but im worried about Joe and Becca. Things aint right, and theyre saying theyre "on a break" which can never be a good thing.... hopefully they will have made it up by saturday.  Anyways, i think thats enough for now.... watch this space.  Keep it safe,  Veg  **thinks** i need something to go at the ends here.... anyone got any suggestions? **/thinking**
