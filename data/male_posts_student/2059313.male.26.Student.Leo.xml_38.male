"You're not a big enough dork, Scott, here's some glasses so the kids at school can make fun of you." - "Hey, Scott... you're dad has cancer." - "Hey looky there, Scott, your dad is dead" - "Okay, what we're going to do now is put little pieces of metal on your teeth, and then attach a wire connecting all of them... THEN once or twice a month for the next two and a half years, you must come BACK so that we can sit you in this chair and tighten them until you cry.  Oh, and not to mention the kids at school who didn't already make fun of you... well, heh, the will now!" - "Sorry Scott, but you have a floating eye... it's going to get worse as you get older, and we'll probably have to cut it out eventually, but Pirates look cool with those patches, right?!" - "Guess what, Scott!? Thanks to school, you've developed a crooked back, and developed what we call, you're "effed" syndrome, on the bright side we caught it right at the moment that there's nothing we can do about it."  But really the one that I didn't mind going to, was the eye doctor... it was the easiest... no needles, no pain, no touching me "down there" and telling me to cough!  I'm very thankful that there are doctors... a lot of people would die or live horrible lives without them... some of my family are even doctors, and definitely love them.  Anyway, I went to the eye doctor yesterday for the first time in about three years, and that was great.  I love being able to see, and I thank God that he gave someone the inventive mind to create contact lenses.  Contacts...Helping dorks blend in since 1945.
