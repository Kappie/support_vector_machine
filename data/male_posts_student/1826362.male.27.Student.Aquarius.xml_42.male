Really, watch an episode before you write this show off.  urlLink  Stiperella  is part wonder woman and part Barbarella; a "stripper by night. crimefighter by later night." Pam Anderson is the voice in this really really wacky animated series by Stan Lee.  Yes,  that  Stan Lee.  The episode I saw last night featured Cheapo the dicsount villan.  His henckmen share one gun, and he rips off the 89 cent store.  The final showdown over the worlds largest cubic zirconium imitation diamond (valued at over $300) in the World's Largest Items Museum is hilarious.  Picture the world's largest vibrting banana, world's largest key and keyhole, and a sign showing visitors where the world's largest    pen is   located, and you get the picture.  The animation is top notch, and the jokes are high and lowbrow enough for everyone, except the humorless.       And the Most Extreme Elimination Challenge ( urlLink MXC ) is something that I don't think can really be described.   It appears to be a Japanese game show, dubbed entirely with jokes that appear to have little or nothing to do with anything going on on screen.  A bunch of people competing in games that inevitably end up with people taking really really hard falls from high heights or into solid structures.  Vic Romano and Kenny Blankenship announce with side kicks like Guy LaDouche that remind me of  urlLink Benny Hill
