I went to my favourite chat "Sapporo-Chat" and met up with the girl I quite like from chatting before. We did some video-chatting by msn and it was really fun - we were talking about spending a lot of time together, when we meet in Osaka or Kyoto. Well, she is a really sweet and good-looking person! At the end of the chat, well, I asked for her age and really got surprised: she told me that she was 31 years old, once married. Wow, that was something - I thought she was around my age, maybe 2 or 3 years older. But I would not call this an disadvantage, maybe if we keep a good contact and enjoy ourselves together I'll give it a try and start an relationship with her. Right now, I don't know yet. I think it will all be decided when we meet for the first time. I'm really looking forward to it!
