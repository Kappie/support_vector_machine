How embarrasing. Am going to a show tonight, the Hot Hot Heat, which should be fun, and before that am meeting f for drinks, she wants to go to the local, but i am going to lobby for seeing hal ( hal's our pal) as we can probably get more for our money. I am really looking forward to going out, i have not in soo long, and i think it has been over a week since i had a drink, no wonder my liver feels so healthy. Well, nuts to you liver, i am going to have some fun tonight!! Holiday, Celebrate and all that jazz. Will be gone this weekend in wisconsin with jannie. We're going to see the land and to help with the wood bee, where a lot of the family get together to split and stack enough wood to heat the farmhouse for the winter. What joy is mine. I'll ruin my hands. Oh well. It'll be nice to get a good ramble over the land in, see what trees have been blown down, and all the lovely fall colors. Maybe even get in some canoeing, though i'm not sure about that.  anywho cheers devin
