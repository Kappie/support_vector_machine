So don’t come crying to me when you realise that my actual life does not at all live up to my site’s name.    Hi and if you haven’t guessed my name is Az.    Actually, my name is Alan, being called Az is just one of side effects that growing up in beach town had on me. Apart from being blessed with name that resembles the peak of the Bogan culture, there is more to me than a single syllable.  I was thinking of putting my “getting to know Az” Information in bullet form but Stories are just so much more fun.    Az - the Boy with a Monosyllabic Name
