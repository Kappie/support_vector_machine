I'm quite lazy to get up from my nice seating position.. But I think my hunger is getting really serious now.. >_ Awwww.... It seems quite hot in this morning !! Ohhh great !! I cannot enjoy my air-con !! My mother's gonna nag nag nag at me for the bills are in crappy digits.. Can't help it beause normally3 air-cons will be switched on every night.. But yesterday my brother was back from his camp and I have to off it as early as now to cover for his expenses.. I got this problem that I have to on this air-con as long as I am in my room and its getting no way better !! Well, I'm a homesick.. Haha !! Most of my time I spent for the day is being in my cosy room.. My noodles are finally ready !! YIPPEEE !!! Gotta run so ZOOOOM !!!
