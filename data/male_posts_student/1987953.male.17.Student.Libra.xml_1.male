You all know I'm working at Wendy's until college, right? I am so tired in mental anguish from all of the hard decisions made, and physical anguish from all of the hard bathrooms cleaned. Unfortunately, they make me clean all of the bathrooms because I do so well... seriously. I was on register today, which is a high step up. It's pretty cool. Well now it is everyone's chance to respond. Hit the little link to make a comment. I will be back AT LEAST once a day to see what is written. Peace!
