I, personally, don't watch queer as folk, but im pretty sure that's a pure queer show. Then there is also Will and grace, another smash hit with either straight or queer people. and finally there is a new show - queer eye for teh straight guy. Again a smash hit and it focusing on ngay peoplel. Whats more is that lesbianism seems to have gone OUT of fashion. Ohwell, mi guess its not all that enthralling stuff it is just TV.  P.S. tere will be anotyher post explaining thje finatastic day i had.  Poisoned shrrrrroom to: Lack of work today - damn guilt!  ! up Shroom to: Fantastic day so far!
