Since his responses came a bit late or took a really long time to come.  And I just didn't have the feeling that he was listening.  Then I found out he was talking to Amy, who wasn't feeling so chipper either, and some other guy that he's going to Dorney Park with today.  So I told him that I was going to bed.  I didn't feel like staying up for no reason to talk and have a third of his attention.    I did manage to tell him that I told Charlotte about us.  And the whole "Which side of the fence are you on?" sort of deal.  I don't know.  And people should stop pressuring me about it.  Geeze, what difference does it make?  If I want to find out, it would be for myself.  Not for other people.  So I left Matt since I think Amy's problems seem a bit more urgent or something.  And I didn't want to deprive Amy of Matt's attention.  Matt did, however, wave off that other guy.  And I felt better.  But I don't know.  I wanted his full attention.  And I guess if I didn't have his full attention, I didn't want it at all.  Childish, I know.  But thats how I felt.    I hate it how he doesn't understand my situation at all.  Even if I do get awesome test scores on the SAT's, SAT II's or whatever, I'm still not going to get into every college, or even my dream college.  Money.  Geeze, he makes it sound like its no big deal.  I hate that.  I hate talking to him about colleges.  How his family is so well off that they really don't care what he studies in college.  He can go anywhere, the only thing limiting him is his brain.  I'm limited by a wallet.  I hate that so much.  "Don't worry about that until later."  Fuck you.  Anyway.  Today was the last day of Forensics.  And I am so glad.  Danielle is seriously getting on my nerves.  She's getting way too touchy-feely on me.  I was complaining how it sucks to drive in a hot car and she comes over and says, "What?  Hot?  You're hot? What?" like she didn't know what she was talking about.  Lady, I feel your presence in my bubble.  Stay out of my bubble.  Stop freakin touching me.    Other than the bubble-invading lady, today was okay.  I liked getting to know the other people.  And doing science work.  It is like a full day of biochem lab or something.  With smart people.  Which is always a nice change.  Group Picture.  Matching La Salle t-shirts!  Corny.  Next week.  Same thing.  Only with electron microscopes.  Awesome.  I want to talk to matt today.  Maybe today will be better.  Maybe today, we'll have one of those conversations about whatever that I never want to end.  But they always do.  At 2:00 in the morning.  I love those conversations.  I am really going to miss them.  Who will be my Matt-replacement?  Whatever.
