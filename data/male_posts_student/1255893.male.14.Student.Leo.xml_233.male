There were soooo many bees. Not kewl. After about an hour or so of panicking, me and my bro settled down to a few rounds of chess. I was doing really good for once, even though I lost every match.  Umm, I might go out tomorrow. If I don't go to Citywalk I might have plans to do somethin else. I still don't know if ANY of those will happen, so I might just end up playing games all day. Either way, should be fun tomorrow.  "Eww! Your sweat tastes bad!!" ---> I'm never going to that park again.... EVER!
