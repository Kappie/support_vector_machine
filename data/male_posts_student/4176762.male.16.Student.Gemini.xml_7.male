We then rush to school for this "new student greeting" thing, kinda pointless for me but it was fun.  I met up with a dude I shall call Shaggy and after the school thing the three of us ran by my house to pick up Alien and then went to Leethar's.  For the better part of the day we had an AvP2 LAN Party...among three people.  We each took turned owning each other and has a lot of fun.  We took two breaks, one to watch Predator and the other to watch Alien, duh.  Then around 7PM we three headed to the Paradiso, they went to hold seats and I went to play DDR.  Umm, Blackdog, you never told us what movie you went to go see.  Jeez, I thought you knew, we wnt to go see AvP.  Also Alakai, Wayland and El Taco were there.  Just to tell you all, the movie roxored!!!1one  After the movie I met up with my brother and his girlfriend who weren't allowed in the movie because it was sold out. So sad for them.  After the movie more AvP2 ownage continued until Shaggy left and the games slowed down.  Then  the History Channel was turned on and a program on sniping was on. Then I decided to blog.  So I did.  I'm really tired and should probably stop now.  Okay, okay I'm stopping. Until next time.
