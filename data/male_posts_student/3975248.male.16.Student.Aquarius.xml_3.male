I've been wanting to check it out  for a while to see what their service was like. There were a couple of things that I found rather interesting during the service. Thought I'd share them with you.   //Music.  First of all the music. One of the things I notice right away when I visit a church. (That was one of the driving forces of oneighty that pulled me in.) It wasn't too bad, although I knew only one or two songs. The drummer didn't seem to be keeping a solid beat either. He was just kind of "tinkling" around on the drums. And there was too much guitar. I'm guessing that had to do with the mixing in the soundbooth, which by the way is very cool. It's located on the second floor of the building..... pretty interesting. But all in all the music was good, some great instrumental parts and that kind of thing.   //Presentation.  Secondly is video presentation. This was pretty good too. There weren't too many weird things about it. I liked that the song slides had the title of the song (something to think about at our church). As far as video goes, there were two big pieces of video clips. First, during the announcement part they showed a video, which I wasn't very impressed with. The quality was not real great, and the blue screen before they hit play came up on the screen, not real impressive either. The second piece of video on the other hand was of much better quality. This was the video opener for the message. This was put together by Praise Fellowship, and they did an excellent jorb! Two thumbs up on that one. Another big thing I noticed was the logo, which was nice and crisp looking, and the transition from it to other things was great.  //Message.  Very enjoyable message. Pastor Ed is on a series called "Extreme Makeover". He talked about desires and greed tonight. The opener, like I said up above was excellent. The material shared was good, relevant material. Which always gets a thumbs up.  //Overall feel.  Pretty good. I'm not sure if I would attend every week, it just isn't my style. I like things really loud and peppy. But that's why God brings us to the churches that we're in. Everyone was very friendly, and I enjoyed worshipping with that body of believers.  Interested in learning more about Praise Fellowship?
