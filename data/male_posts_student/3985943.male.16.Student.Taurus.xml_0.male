If any of you have an older sibling you know what its like. I love her and all, but lately all she has been doing is just critisizing me to hell. Everything I own, everything I do, anything that relates to me in any way, even if I can't control it, she puts down. And I'm getting really sick of it. It's gotten to the point where I just want to get away from her, go off to college so I won't have to see her anymore. So I won't have to deal with her shit.   I was discussing this a little with Randy *her bf* a few minutes ago, and she(and he)seems to be mad at the fact that my mom likes Matt better than Randy. Which is not true. My mom doesn't even know Matt. The only thing she has ever said to me about him is that he is attractive. She doesn't talk much about Randy, but I can understand what false impression she might get of him by my sisters constant complaining about things he does. But she doesn't hate him.  I'm a lot like my mom was in high school, never having any boyfriends, but having lots of friends that are guys. *minus the small factor that the majority of my guy friends are gay* No that I have a ton of guy friends.... but nonetheless thats not the point. HER sister, on the other hand, constantly had a boy. I don't get boyfriends. Angela's had one for going on 4 years. I think that my mom just knows what its like to be alone, under the influence of a constantly attatched sibling. And she's happy that I have a boyfriend now. Its new and exciting and she's glad for me. Not that I ever talk to her about my relationship/Matt anyway, but thats irrelevant also. But she can relate to me, and I am so much like her its scary.  So I think Angela's jealous in a way. She wants mom to be excited for her and Randy like she is for me. But, they've been together for so long that its nothing to be excited about anymore.    And she also is angry at the fact that I don't really "follow the rules" and I'm not such a goody goody ms. perfect like she is. I lie to my parents, I go out till all hours of the night, I have a life and friends and will do anything to keep it that way. I don't get in trouble, and its not like I'm doing anything illegal. But she, doesn't really have any friends. Not around here anyway. And she doesnt really have a life.   She told me how stupid she thought it was that we all cried at graduation.  I wanted to punch her in the face and be all "Fuck you, thats just because you didnt have any friends in high school!!" which she didn't. She had Randy, and Ian, and Putnam and Cam. And thats it. But I have so many and I love them all. She's just jealous, I know. High school sucked for her, and I'm sorry, but my high school was awsome and I loved it. I'm going to miss it a lot. I want to say something to Randy, and I probably will eventually, but I know it'll just get back to her. Because that stuff happens with them. So I have to be real careful what I say to him nowadays.   She doesn't accept me and accept my life. It pisses her off for some reason, and I'm not trying to seek her approval on anything so I really don't care. But at the same time I don't want her to critisize everything in my life. I don't even ask her opinion and she throws it in my face. I don't think she realizes how much it affects me. I don't go around trashing everything she thinks anddoes. I keep my opinions to myself unless necessary.   She doesn't approve of Matt and our relationship, she doesn't like my clothes, or my choice of bedding for college, or the color of my room, or my music, or anything else. Can you possibly imagine why I don't talk to her about my life? I listen to all of her bitching and complaining and tales of her college life or drama with people, but I don't tell her a single thing about what is going on in my world. She knows the basics, yes, because some things you're going to learn when being sisters with someone. But she isn't even a part of my personal life. I try to tell her things and she just doesn't listen. So I gave up on that a long time ago. Thats what my friends are there for, to listen and to comfort me and to be there for me. Family is supposed to do that too, but my family pretty much sucks at being close and at all family like, so I have to overcompensate with my friends. I think I'd kill myself if I didn't have you guys.   Versus, why I'm going away to college and never coming home. *at least, not very often*I love my family and all but, they aren't really a family. They're like distant relatives that I happen to live with. I feel like I can't really fix things now. Its not worth the effort. My friends are my family. They are all I need to survive.
