Yeah yeah uh. -Moulin Rouge, "Lady Marmalade"  haha, the month started out great! school was awesome and everyone was so yeah..   but of course my history caught up with me and I began hearing and thinking more about dominic.   i saw him for the first time in 2 months at the mall (of course) and i kinda walked past him. he really pissed me off with his little pissy-ness but whatever. it was a fun day with janis, sally and monique. OMG! we saw ellen in the car on the drive home it was HILARIOUS!   school went on as usually... not really much change. alec was kinda acting weird and chris and patrick were a lil on the alert mode too... i think chris was stoned one day..   annie was lots of fun to hang out with and mesha as well.. and ivy was great.. i met tess in october at aldos. she was really fun and we got to be friends really really fast. michele was cool too and i talked to her and katy quite frequently.   first sat.: can you say kaboom? it was the anual monte carlo fireworks. nelli scored free tickets from kathryns mom.. lol.. even tho i bought a bunch from chris hastings..   i ended up going with kathleen and planned on meeting carolyn, nelli and katy there. i saw chris and carson (really funny guy from the h/a) there with alec. alec kinda gave me the glare and i talked to carson and chris for a little bit but continued looking at the really awesome booths.   Dominic came later... after carolyn and nelli and katy had arrived. lol! carolyn's dad is awesome! well back to dominic~ i let him borrow my shirt for no reason since he had a sweatshirt but whatever. i didnt noe i wouldnt get it back until 2004!! >:-o!   well he ditched us for other harbor people WHILE WEARING MY SHIRT!  so we wandered and i saw elizabeth and naomi and jorden and alyssa and even van dyk! the coolest math teacher from shoreline!!   the fireworks were magical. it was sooo pretty. and i wasnt that far from the rest of the soquelians.... so yeah.. it was great. :-)   lol! this is the best part~ ok so the roads were all closed cause of like some fucked up drunks and we walked to the gas station to wait for kathleen's mom. on the way these cars honked at us and i slapped my ass!! and then at the gas station i swear something was in those bushes!! well at like 11 kathleen's mom and really funny sister darlene got their and we drove to the bank and then BK to satisfy those midnight munchies :-P!   the fireworks weekend was great.   second weekend: snooze! i slept all weekend.. it was great!!   school was getting more and more fun! i was getting closer to everyone.. even patrick and i found common ground~ This is halloween, this is halloween...  the thursday b4 harbor homecoming i called dominic and he was too drunk to talk to me.. so he HUNG UP!!   thrid weekend: Harbor Homecoming go pirates! go pirates! bleh~ this weekend was kinda lame. i met tara at the frosh game and sat with tess and ivy and tara and katy. it was all good. then nathalie and tina and crystal came. after the frosh game i took a quick pic of luken! damn he transferred outta my pe class :-(! well yeah, then ivy, tess and the 3 shorline chicks all went to the deli with me and we ate food. lol.. then i farted.. BUT IT WAS TINA'S FAULT!! tess and ivy left and so i went with kalie and naomi back to the game. that was the first time i saw chris albrecht, dominic's fuck buddy. YUCK! well he was.. um.. "alrite" as nathalie put it.   well i saw dominic a lil bit before the half time of the Varsity game. annie and aby were there too! god i love annie! shes so funny.. and aby changed it this really gross porter potty... half time was kinda weird.. there were dancers.. enough said... i stole tina's lip gloss and almost O.D.ed on it! yay... i stole her soda too..   well then i went and sat with naomi and talked to this really hot guy (who turned out to be taylor!) but i doubt he remembers me.. he was REALLY hot!! oh and i saw jack.. yeah.. no comment :-/  tina had to get a ride home with nathalie and crystal so we wandered around trying to find them but ended up getting really really lost... and yeah... we found them in the end and tina was like "BYE!" and she ran.. and then i talked to dominic and he was kinda iffy but he left with chris to fuck and get ready for the dance and fuck. thats like all they do. well at least hes HAPPY~!!! :-D  yeah well i left with kalie and naomi and it was alotta fun and i was sooo gonna go to the bon fire with jack rodriguez (from french) and a bunch of santa cruz fags but i got sick :-( ...  well school that week was lame cause i had the sniffles.. but i didnt have to swim... so boo ya! elizabeth and me chilled in the gazebo, or how ever you spell it, by the pool!  on thursday i went into the girls locker room for the THIRTEENTH time and like they invited me in and shit and then mrs. locke like fucking grabbed me and hauled me to waddel's office. i got detention, but still it was better than suspension which it woulda been if mrs. locke had her way. >:-o!  the rallies leading up to our homecoming were great! and the homecoming rally was awesome. everyone wanted jeff gill to win (pshyeah~!!) but to rouse support ivy and i made up some poems  Mirror Mirror on the Wall, Damn Jeff is fine!! If I were homecoming crown, I would want him mine!  When you see him on the floor, Ooo la la, you gasp, VOTE JEFF GILL FOR KING.. Or we'll kick your ass~!!  the last weekend: OUR HOMECOMING~!!  it was sooo fucking awesome! so it starts out at the church place with naomi and we watch the parade and jeff and calire throw candy at us and its awesome! and corey was the head cheerleader and it was so cool! so naomi and i met ivy and michele and we walked up the long trail to campus. we see the parade and the band coming up the drive, and then michele and me and ivy go in early for the frosh game. we walk in and see tara and patches sitting up in the stands. so we all hang out during the frosh game and we buy food and patrick gets this little sugar packet and hes like "i think you dropped your name tag.." it was so funny and adorable! after the frosh game we went and chilled at surf city and i got a stoked strawberry.. my soon to be favorite drink!   we got back for the second half of the game and nelli came running over all frantic. "I need help with the freshman float!!" she said, "Will you help?" so patrick is like "yeah!" and we're like "patrick!" and he's like "remember that time.." "NO!!" but we ended up going because nelli is the coolest and patrick is kinda cute underneath it all. so we get to the big orange truck and we're like "no.." but we ended up decorating it and it looked great. tara and patrick ran to berverlys for markers and posters and streamers, and nelli, michele, ivy and i worked on the masking tape and shit."  Rc, the stupid butt hole, and his other senoirs got on their float.. ours was SOOO crappy. it was sad. i shared a sign with michele cause it was really big and when we went in we circled around and we made fun off the irish! ha ha ha ICE THE IRISH!! so yeah and then we went to our side and woot woot! it was fun. but they put ont he brakes and i fell on patrick. it was so much fun! alec and chris showed up and threw candy at us and patrick chucked this thing back at them.. and madalee and heddy showed up~!! they were supposed to be on the floats but oh well...  so after the floats we took down everything and i scored some pretty green shoes.. they were cute. well i went back and sat with naomi engleman this time (before it was all bradford) and amber from my PE class.. (ive mentioned her, right?) well it was great and after the game i went over to carolyn and we talked and then i went with her and madalee and heddy into the band room since naomi bradford was giving me a ride home. well it was fun and we all talked and then i left promising to dance with them at the dance.  i dressed in mardi gras clothing and my new abercrombie hat! i got to the dance and found ivy and michele and we all went in to the dance. ASB stickers really do pay off.... well the dance was fun. lots of freak dancing! the only girl i didnt dance with was ivy cause she didnt wanna with a gay man, and michele kinda danced with me but left. i had fun tho. SLOW DANCE SHOUT OUTS 2: Carolyn! Nique! and... um.. who else did I dance with!? Shit!! I think it was Tara.. but i dunno and I dont wanna be all like mean.. i freaked with everyone including that girl who wants to have fun~ ANNIE ROSS! woot woot monkie style~!! i even kinda freaked with patchy... KINDA.. but eww.. :-)  suzie and kayla were really fun and yeah.. the dance ended and ellen was nice enough to give me a ride home! woot woot! so after the dance i passed out and the next day i got really sick and i slept most of it..  the last week was really cool. it started fun and ended FANTASTIC on halloween when we all went over to suzie's house. halloween was great from beginning to end. i got pictures of everyone including sexy ivy as a bunny outta a hat and amber + naomi the sweedish bar maids! i didnt have to dress in pe cause of the costume. ooo i was LEI BOY! it was great and yeah.. french was crazy and we didnt really do anything. after school i went to suzie's and we went swimming and into a really nice jacuzzi.. wow.. thinking about it makes me wanna pee... so after we went inside and watched movies and listened to music and ate pizza! that was the first of suzie's parties!! yay! i met a lot of people at that party.. it was really cool..  halloween.. the LAST DAY OF OCToBER~!! it feels like somethin's heatin' up!  lates bRaNdOn (Choppin' Broccolli ;-))
