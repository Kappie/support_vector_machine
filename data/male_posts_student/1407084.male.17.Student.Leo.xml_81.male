I stole that right outta the dictionary, by the way. You see, what I think is going on around here is a lot of numbers 1 and 2, but no 3. When I think of a friend, I think of someone I could tell anything to, someone that will listen and understand what is going through my head. Very few people I know fit this description. However, for whatever reason it is, I don't tell those few people. If I have something on my mind, whether it be a problem or a good idea or whatever, the people I usually tell first would shrug it off and change the subject. Therefore, for the longest time, there was really nowhere for me to go, nobody for me to talk to. Today though, a friend told me exactly what I wanted/needed to hear.. that there are, in fact, people who genuinely care and enjoy my presence.   I seriously do not want to give you guys the impression that you aren't my friends, though. Don't get that idea stuck in your head, I really think all of you guys are great people. But being friends isn't just about going to parties with each other or watching movies with each other. It goes way deeper than that.   I leave you with a quote:  "To have a friend, be a friend."
