(that's how I live without cable TV)  I am wondering what is the next show I should download.  Hmm...    I want to get Vonage Telephone really much so.  It is awesome.  I wish it had our area code. Well, I could get a Chicago area code or maybe a Miami one.  Besides that my life is very much the same as it always is.  And in fact, I think those few things I mentioned were the same as they always are.  That means everything I do is the same.  Except, right now I am drinking water.  That is different.
