But now that I found you I want you to know I had forgotten how to smile, how to laugh, how to be me I had forgotten the sweet pleasure of a heart filled with glee. I was intoxicated with life... work and family Never stopping for fun... it just wasn't there you see. Since I have found you... it's been a complete turn around I smile and laugh again... not much gets me down. I get excited when I see you on MSN Listening to your Cheerful self again... Chatting, laughing and the games we play You make my every day. It seems so silly on just a machine How someone can reach you... become your everything.   Empty...That's how I feel without you. Every day that we're apart Feels like an eternity. You move me... Make me feel things I thought I would never feel again. When I am with you, I feel a warmth wash over me. A warmth unlike any I have felt before. It picks me up and carries me to a far off place, A beautiful place... A place where nothing is known but love and caring. My worries fade to a distant memory, And all but you is forgotten, If only for the moment... My heart is overflowing with joy and love, The joy that you bring to me, And the love that I feel for you. Never have I come across anyone like you... Sweet, warm, tender, caring... I become overwhelmed in your presence, lost... Lost to my imagination, to the thought of you. I'm lost in a wonderful dream, and I never want to wake up. You... You are too good to be true... My Damsel in Distress. The woman I've been searching for... The woman of my dreams. And now I have you, Yet I cannot have you. To see you would be heavenly, To touch you, divine. I want to share my life with you... You are my waking thought And the last thing on my mind As I drift off to sleep at night. You fill my dreams with visions of happiness and love, Visions that linger on and carry me through my day. There is a longing in my heart That someday we will become a reality. I want you with every fiber of my being. I need you as I need water, or food, or air. I miss you every second of every day. And for everything that you are to me, Everything that you will ever be, I love you...
