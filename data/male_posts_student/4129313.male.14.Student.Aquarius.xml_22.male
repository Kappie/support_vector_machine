All it is is find a PDA, shoot a zombie/demon, walk through a door, find a PDA, shoot a zombie/demon, and walk through yet another door.  It gets extremely repeditive after awhile. And then I goto hell and fight this big bastard, and all you have to do is destroy that doohicky above him. Then you get a soul cube. Thats all you get for fighting the bastard 100 times before you finaly accidently shoot a few meter's above. And they said the graphics would be almost realistic, but the texture quality is ABSOLUTELY CRAP!! and constantly I get tearing so bad that the vertexes are literely ATTACHED to my xhair, often times exposing the next stage, and completely ruining the supprise of the attack.   I personaly think doom 3 was nothing but the hype.    I posted this on projectw, but now that I got a blog I guess I can post it here too now ;)
