Because when i'm with you, your ultimate wish is to chase all my unhappiness away, to keep me smiling and laughing. And i will do just that- your love keeps me in bliss.But the moment your hand stops touching mine, the second which either you, or i, turn away, i feel my heart crumbling again. I literally feel my dilemma creeping back in, haunting my thoughts and somehow, i just cannot smile again. It is not another who is making me sad, rather it is this torn feeling in me which i cannot seem to ignore. Try as i might, i cannot feel the same sense of freedom i have when you are around. When you are around i feel protected, i feel as though nothing can go wrong."      -taken from kesh's earlier entry      Listening to a song by joey, " lonely portrait " for the past week. Somehow, i've been enraptured in a series of thoughts, including several mixed emotions.   “记忆是照片 总不停拿出来翻阅     我们的照片 温柔在左边 深情在右边      少了你 故事没能到终点”      I'm settling in well in school, Cute Co. rocks however corny it sounds; we're a fantastic class. The whole of this week has zipped pass meso quickly. Monday; we had Thinking andproblem solving classwhich wewere given questions to answer, its proven that there are so many different ways to look and perceive at a situation. Tuesday; a black day for me other than meeting my lovely girlfriend after school. I spilled cola on mywhite shirt, got a cut on my finger out of nowhere, andthe worst had to happen, stepping on chewing gum. Wednesday; I'm finally starting to grasp my modules and I had floorball practice. Thursday;late for school, in the end I only attended the 11am class since there was no point barging into the lecture room LATE with everyone staring at your totally drenched clothes. Friday; weekend is finally here (:      I've met really fantastic people in my class, the best being amy (: I was surprised to know how philosophical she was even in the short conversations that we held, but its a good thing. In a way, she's the person i'm able to connect best in school, talking about our lives, studies, families or even cracking oh-so-lame jokes. Xing, with his multiple indentities including "xiao tian tian", "Si wen zai", "babooXING" and the original; "Ma SiXing". heh. He's someone else i'm thankful to know, because with him and Jonathan, we're the pioneers of Cute Co. ;D If our class didn't have Irene, it'd have prolly been boring since day one, therefore we're all glad to have her. I'm happy in school, yet there are times, when I cover my worries with smiles and laughter.       I miss you.  I remember the conversation we had last Saturday, on the train. Did you know how wonderful it felt to be there, simply putting my arms around your waist like I always do just because i don't want you to fall, or for anyone else to knock into you. We discussed about the Singapore education system, on how it has failed to cultivate and inculcate creativity yet claim its an efficient system. There's still a little part on me, that still holds on to the Literature culture in me even though I'm an IT student now. It was sad, to realise that people like Gwen, Houston or even KaiSheng and Kang Wei dropped literature because they took math and science in JC and there was no combination that included Literature. But someone I used to look up to, and still do, is still pursuing her dream however taxing its been on her. Kesh dear, we're not as close as we used to be, however I still pray that one day, you will make it where you always wanted to. Mass Comm is tough, but I believe in you.       Last night, I dreamt of you.  I was so close to you, yet I had to wake up. Together with me are memories of such wonderful times we've spent in union; walking in the rain at Chinese garden, when you celebrated my birthday for me at the Esplanade park that night, the way you flustered when you thought you had lost our ring, or simply, the image of you lying so peacefully, sleeping on my bed.      Be married at 24, giving only Chinese names to our children, being fillial to our parents.   __we could be such, love birds         I realised, i'm so in love with the girl I've been with since the 10th of March, year 2003.
