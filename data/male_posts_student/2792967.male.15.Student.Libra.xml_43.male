I sit back and listen to the radio chatter as I think back on what the afternoon has bestowed upon me. :wanes world dream sequence: Didley-do Didley-do Didley-do......As we walked into the airport I could feel the tention between me and dad growing. I hate flying with him, he is allways so uptight. We get inline and wait...and wait..and finally make it up to the check in counter. As soon as we tell her where we are going, she askes for out passports. I inform her that we do not need passports for travel to Canada. She insists, her computer is telling her that South African citizens must have a passport. But, we tell her, we are traveling as US residant aliens, not as SA citizens. She will not deviate however. Eventually, she calls in a supervisor who goes to the back and verifies that we do not need passports. Secure in the hope that our travel troubles are behind us, we head to the gate. The call for boarding is announced, and me and Steve step up to board. I am suddenly informed that I need some sort of other ticket to board, and that, "your parents must have it". Mildly frustrated, we find the rents and proceed to the back of the line. Still unsure of what exactly it is I need, I inquire the gate attendant. She then informs me that I need to be security screened for a second time, and that I should have been stopped at security for an advanced search. Angered, I wait for the TSA agent to show up. The hour is getting late, and the plane will soon depart. Eventually, at the eleventh hour, the scanner shows up. In short order I am scanned. As I walk toward the gate, an attractive girl, my age, possibly a bit older, stops me. "Are you guys from South Africa?" she asks. I tell her we are, and we exchange smiles. That being the one consolation I have had, I board the plane and take my seat. So here I am. Post later when we get to the hotel.         Ok, so Im here in the hotel, accessing a wifi network that Im not quite sure I am allowed on, but I am sure Im not paying 10/day for internet. This is the coolest hotel I have ever stayed in. Corner room, 10th floor. Post tommorow.
