I didn’t find any online columns directed at gay teenage men that I could relate to, so I decided to write my own. You probably will roll your eyes quite a bit while reading my columns, please note that I’m not as narcissistic as I sound, well I hope not. I may not be People magazine’s sexiest man alive but I am pretty damn desirable. If you don’t like my column shut your mouth and just close the god-forsaken window. This is my way of sharing my ‘experience’.   Ok, first of all, I have come up with a list of the kind of men that you should probably avoid. .    1.Do not date men that dress perfectly but have bad nails, especially toenails   This tells you that the guy doesn’t dress up because he wants to do it, he does it to prove something to other people, and in other words he’s a shallow twat. Since people usually don’t notice his nails (especially toenails) he doesn’t take the 5 minutes necessary to groom himself. A man that doesn’t pay attention to details is just……undatable. We ALL deserve better. Well, most of us do.    2. If you’re not looking for sex and your partner begins to say sexual things and immediately say he’s joking, dump him ASAP.   This is a method used by guys that want to get in your pants but aren’t man enough to make a pass. A man that wants to hit on you without  consequences. In other words, a gutless loser. If you ignore this it will just happen more often until you inevitably dump him (unless you are pathetic and lack self-respect). So don’t waste your time, dump the wanker as soon as possible. Don’t get me wrong, a perverted joke every once in a while is funny but if it becomes a habit it’s just a bore.    3.Do not date anyone that doesn’t care about their appearance at all   Must I explain? This signifies laziness. Using common sense, a man that is too lazy to get himself to look presentable sure as hell can’t get with me (or with anyone with dignity).    4.Do not date anyone without self-respect   If they don’t respect themselves how are you supposed to respect them? They’re usually self-loathing and a complete bore. NEXT.    5.Do not date anyone insecure with their masculinity   Trust me, these are absolutely the worst kinds of men. They are really insecure about their masculinity and so they overcompensate. Its sad really, or hilarious, depending on your sense of humor. It is really annoying though.    6.Do not date cocky overconfident pricks   It’s amusing at first, but it gets really old – fast.   The are the qualities that your date should have are:    1.Men with nice smiles   I know this is a total cliché but you can’t go wrong with a nice smile. He can’t be all that bad.
