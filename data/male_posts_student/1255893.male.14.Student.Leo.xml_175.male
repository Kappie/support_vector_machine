Ive been reading some stuff that journaling or jus free writing helps fix that....... so lets try it:   today was aiight.. nuthin really special to point out, 'cept it was hot as Aaron ;-) I was havin this chat with johnny during lunch, nuthin fun was goin on so we jus decided to walk around. We each started makin small talk  (.....small talk sucks) so I started talkin bout what was goin on last night. I had this awesome time on the phone with Roy and Mel. It was only about 10 or so, and I still had some work to do for english. None the less, I was really sleepy. I derno, must be something in the air thats been makin me wanna sleep early. It aint jus me, Ive been talking to teachers and friends about this. Most of them have been havin the same thing goin on. Its pretty trippy. I had this theory that it had something to do with the alignment of the planets ......... but thats cwazy talk. Bleh, can't dismiss it though.   Cant wait till spring break. I get to chill, see some peoplez. Its also after I have some big projects due..... sop this is gonna be like a vacation for me!   Talkin on the phone with mel right now, i SHOULD be doing homework... but uh .... yeaaaah.   Man oh man.. . I need to take a walk right now... this zephyr is sooooooooo sexy!!!! woah, I love summer-ish nights. hey ppl.. im out. L8
