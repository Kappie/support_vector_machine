Well 3rd period was lame cuz i had math and i didnt know anything that was on the final. So all i did was jus copy my main man Nathan'z answerz and i did a few myself, and that was that. Chemistry was sooooooo kick back cuz all we did was jus take notes on a movie. And we also ate popcorn and goofed off...so 2 classes down...4 more to go...imma c if i could take my u.s. history final during 6th period so i wont miss the tourny on friday, i guess i have some studying to do tonite...and i have to study for english, all i need though is like a 50% on it to get a B...so its all good...payce outside!
