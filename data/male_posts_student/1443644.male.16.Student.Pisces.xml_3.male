       
        Well, after promising myself, and my readers that I would write in this damn thing as much as possible I realized that I have failed myself, as well as you. I have had so many things on my mind lately and it is just slowly driving me crazy (to say the least). So much has happened since I made my last confession, so much that I have forgotten most of it. I spent a few nights at Jordyn's house watching movies, and hung out with Katie, Gennie, Monica, and Jordyn off and on. I traveled to Boston with Monica, and had rehearsals for summer theater... Things had improved for about a week, but they went back to normal last night when two people "reunited," but it was good while it lasted... I honestly don't feel like writing right now, because I might say something that I may later regret... Wow, that is a first, usually I just say it, but oh well... More will come on this topic later, when I have better spirits.
