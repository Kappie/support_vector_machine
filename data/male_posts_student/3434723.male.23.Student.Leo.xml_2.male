A story about 2 brothers, one good one evil. And you can say it's a bit of a treasure hunt. A very traditional imagination about adventure, and maybe in the lines of Treasure Island. Not much of romance in it, but that maybe why it cannot be classified as another adventure story. Read it, and tell me how you feel about it.
