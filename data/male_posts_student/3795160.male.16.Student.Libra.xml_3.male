I couldn't write here on account of because where I live (Pakistan) you have to by internet in pre-paid cards. They're reasonable, you get 10 hours for a 100 and so on. The problem was that mine was finished. I didn't find the time to go and get a new one.  Oh well, I finally found a college I liked. It's a little far from my home but I guess I'll just have to get on one bus to get there. The place is nice, home-y, friendly you get the picture. Over all it's a great place!! I mean it's not like those stupid colleges here that will give you admissions on things like religious knowledge or sports! That's right here if you compete in any sporting activity and win you get an admission in that college with a few discounts!! I have a friend who is so much complexed with this one college that he's willing to go through wrestling just to get an admission there!! I mean hey if you need to go through that much trouble just to get into a stupid college then to Hell with that institution.  I guess I better steer away from that topic before I get emotional. On to my site now. I'm getting some progress in my site but I still have some difficulties with Mozilla/FireFox. I guess I'll have to as it over at the  urlLink Asylum (great guys!). These guys seem to know everything! Oh well catch you later.
