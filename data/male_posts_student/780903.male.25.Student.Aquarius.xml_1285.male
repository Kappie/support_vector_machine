(OPEN ON: VH1 video opening to “I Love the ‘80s,” altered to read, “I Love the 1820s” and a montage of clips)  ANNOUNCER From the Missouri Compromise to the invention of the Electromagnet to making your own food, VH1 presents “I Love the 1820s.”  STAND-UP COMEDIAN I’m your host, a stand-up comedian no one’s ever heard of.  Remember where you were when you heard that the whaling ship Essex was rammed and sunk by a sperm whale in the Pacific Ocean?   ANNOUNCER (over a video re-enactment of a whale ramming a ship) It was November 20, 1820, and the Essex was on the sea, looking for whales.  Suddenly, the crew felt the boat shake.  For 94 days, the survivors clung to life, turning to cannibalism when they ran out of food.  MANDY MOORE I think I was getting my nails done when that happened.  HORATIO SANZ Man, I cried myself to sleep that night.  Dude.  STAND-UP COMEDIAN We all remember hearing the terrible news that Daniel Boone had died at the age of 85.  HORATIO SANZ Daniel Boone was da man.  MC HAMMER Daniel Boone.  Man, I miss that fellow.  ANNOUNCER Can you imagine life without a lawnmower?  Neither could Edwin Budding of Massachusetts.  STAND-UP COMEDIAN The lawnmower was originally designed to cut the nap from cotton cloth.  I don’t know about you, but *I* could sure use a nap.  MANDY MOORE I love mowing lawns.  HORATIO SANZ Lawnmower, man.  Wow, lawnmowers.  Dude.  ANNOUNCER And in politics, Congress made the trade of foreign slaves an act of piracy.  MANDY MOORE Go get ‘em, Congress!  STAND-UP COMEDIAN That’s all the time we have tonight on VH1’s “I Love the 1820s.”  Tune in next week for the accurate calculation of the diameter of the Earth, the life of Euclid, and Rome conquering Spain, on VH1’s “I Love the 3rd Century B.C.!”
