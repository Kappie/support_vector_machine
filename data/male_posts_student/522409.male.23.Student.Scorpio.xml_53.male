Sidebar: I think the US needs some sort of pseudo-official drink for its independence day.  I propose something foofy.    Cape Standard time is about as done as done can be (aside from "I Feel Good," but we knew that was gonna be the last one done.) and I couldn't be more relieved if I tried.  The track listing for Cape Standard Time (in no particular order):   Thriller Bohemian Rhapsody I Feel Good 72-Hour Daze On and On Fields of Gold 1000 Miles Sailing Your Smiling Face Fly me to the Moon Last Goodbye Walkin' Away A Parting Blessing L-Y Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay   Sounds pretty solid to me.  Can't wait for all of you to hear it (and you will all hear it... oh yes... you  will  hear it...)  It pretty much blows my mind.  So tonight I was out celebrating the national independence of our neighbors to the south and Jess called.  So random.  But I heaven't heard her voice in forever, and it was really, really nice to hear from her.  Thanks for calling, hon :)  Saw "A Mighty Wind" last night with Cait, Mark, Sara L., and Cait's roommate Jess.  Funny movie.    Chickened out today.  What's new there?  Per her request (and an incredible need deep inside me):   There's this super cool girl named Katrina Who's super fly--you shoulda seen-a She keeps me in line (At least some of the time) and I'm glad it's her, not someone mean-a.  Sank you, sank you... I am be here all zee veek.  Confused.  Thoughts?  (ha... notice how I didn't tell you what I'm confused about and still asked for your thoughts?  I'm good like that.)  Clearly tired, and with throbbing headache, I bid you all a fond...  zzzzzzzzz
