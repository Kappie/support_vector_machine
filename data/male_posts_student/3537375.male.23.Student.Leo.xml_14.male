"Hope is on the way"  "Reporting for duty"  Want some butter with that corn?  Another thing I noticed, look at that huge ass emblem.  Reminds me of those Cadillac Emblems on the back of Escalades.  "Stronger America"  Ok, so from what I understand, on the face of these classic soundbites, the Democrats see America as weak and hopeless as we currently stand.  Damn, I did not know things were that bleak.
