This should be fun, since I love listening to tunes. I've got four CDs I'm going to review. Pillar: Where Do We Go From Here?, MxPx: Let it Happen, East/West: Hope in Anguish, and John Reuben: Professional Rapper. Yes...professional rapper. I know, that's not really something I'd probably listen to, since I usually can't stand to listen to anything without heavy guitar distortion, but its insanely cool! I'll talk about it in a bit.  Pillar: Where Do We Go From Here? Well, this is Pillar's new CD, following their big hit: Fireproof. For those that liked Fireproof, this is a pretty good CD, but it doesn't feature ANY of the awesome rap-core sound featured there. This is album is pure rock and roll, nothing more. The lyrics are pretty good, especially Simply, which is just cool. Especially the scream at the end ;). My only real problem is that ALL of the songs seem to have the exact same form. They open with a set of verses, break into the chorus, verse, repeat chorus, some sort of break, and chorus. That's about it it. I don't know, I guess I'm just kind of spoiled since I've been listening to my old Dogwood CDs, on which most of the songs don't even HAVE a chorus. Anyway, the CD is GREAT for Pillar and standard rock fans, so check it out if you fit one of those.  MxPx: Let it Happen: This is actually an older CD, but I love it anyway! MxPx is a sort of 'bubble gum punk band', meaning that they mostly play the happy punk music that people like to listen to. If you want their more political/hard stuff, check out Teenage Politics. For Let it Happen, the group covers just about EVERY facet of teenage boy/girl relationships, from attraction, to dating, to making excuses for missing dates, to breaking up, to getting over breaking up, to getting back together. Its great. It also features the MxPx classic, "Chick Magnet" which is just a hilarious song about a guy who's a 'chick magnet'. Funny lyrics and some sweet guitar sounds can keep the 'punk heads' entertained for hours.  East/West: Hope in Anguish: I can't seem to stay away from this CD. Its amazing. For anyone with East/West's first CD, The Light in Guinevere's Garden, you know that they are HARD, and this CD doesn't disappoint. They're not metal, but their brand of rock is definitely some of the hardest I've ever heard with a singer that you can 'actually understand'. If you like that sort of thing (I do) this is a CD to go and buy! Actually, I'd suggest you buy both of them, just to enjoy all of their screaming goodness. My only problem with the CD is the insanely stupid last track, which is literally nothing more than some jungle sounds for 13 minutes...yes, 13 minutes. Its an utter waste of space on an otherwise great CD.  John Reuben: Professional Rapper: OK, this is a first for me. This is my first rap album, but I must say I'm not disappointed in the least. Well, ok, just a little. Because its not long enough! John Reuben isn't the stereotypical rapper, though, and maybe that's why I like it so much. He's white, and he looks like he should be in MxPx or Relient K. Reuben's voice is instantly recognizable and easily understandable, both important to me in something like a rap album where you're basically going to be listening to the same guy for 40-50 minutes. The beats are insanely cool, and there are even a few tracks with guitars :D. I actually found myself learning the lyrics after only a few listens, even though the lyrics are much longer than anything I've ever listened to. The opening track, 'Move', is a great opener that will have you rocking if you're into the rap sound he has. However, Reuben shows more than just his rock on side in this CD, with tracks like 'Free to Feel' and 'Five Years to Write'. There is also a 'funny side' when at the end of a track, you can hear John talking and some woman starts yelling things like "Get up there and dance, rap-boy! Come on! Do that little arm thing!" and then a new song begins. Its just funny. Flat out funny. Of course, as many times as I've said that now, you probably think I'm full of crap. But that's OK, cause its my blog and I can say what I want. So there.  Well, there's my CD reviews. Hope I didn't bore you too much, as I rambled on about four of my most played CDs right now. I'm hoping to pick up the new Zao CD, but our Mardells (Christian CD store) doesn't carry them anymore!!! I believe I'll be leading a boycott soon, so watch your news for that ;).
