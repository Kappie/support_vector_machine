I have yet to have crawfish since then, I feel the gurgling of stomach juices just thinking about it.  What does this have to to with Juli's b-day?  Well I missed going out with everyone b/c I had been @ the hostpital and whatnot.  Only good thing that came out of it was that I lost 20 lbs; but it came back...who cares.    Well now Curtis has decided to throw Juli a surprise party (I think she's going to be aggrevated) and I'm going to have to go hang out with people I don't know for who knows how long.  FUN FUN FUN.  ~stay negativ
