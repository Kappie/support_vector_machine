Ok, I was all over the LA area this weekend and I sort of want to comment on perceptions of class and space in southern California. One of So Cal's biggest industries is real estate... there's construction, sales, landscapping, etc. However, in the building of places both physical, social and imagined it's clear that the differentiation falls along socio-economic paramters.  Something really popular, and has been accentuated more by  The O.C.  and other local media is the defining areas by  urlLink area codes ... the 909 (Chino, San Bernadino, etc.), is made fun of as the redneck / trashy part of So Cal. The use of area codes is, of course, in part arbitrarily created by phone companies; however, the values associated with area codes has profound impacts on future area code creation. The creation of 626 is the best example, because it is sandwiched between the so-called "ghetto" 323 and "white trashy" 909. It was created to make "nice" places like Pasadena not a part of the 323 and 909.  To say that there are no poor people in the 323 and trailers in the 909 would not be true, but something about the morphology of So Cal is that it is extremely fragmented so that perceptions of various places being good or bad simply are not absolute realities. Someone once joked to me that in LA you're often times just one or two freeway exits away from ghetto places. The 310 and 562 are good examples in that as you go up the I-405 and along CA-91, you pass through cities both "good" and "bad."   My point of this is that I don't like these stereotypes of place and the people in the places. Because this adds into the idea of a culture of the poor... people perceive people in  those  areas as different (an other). Maybe its just me, but I've never felt unsafe anywhere in So Cal... even in places that are supposed to be bad. I used to date a girl from East LA and I'd drive home to Irvine at 2 AM. People would tell me that I was nuts, but whatever.   Indeed in some places there is more crime than others, but the creation of a "Fortress L.A" as  urlLink Mike Davis  calls it is ultimately problematic. Just as parts of bourgeois upper class LA are designed to restrict foot traffic, and have limited public transit as a way of keeping out the poor... these places often need to employ lower class servants to work in restaurant kitchens, and garden. This is a self-contradicting situation and I think it is further hypocrisy when rich people pull the culture of poverty crap, when they are too lazy to mow their own lawns, and cook their own food. Then these rich folk let the cops to hassle the people coming in to do this work.  ***
