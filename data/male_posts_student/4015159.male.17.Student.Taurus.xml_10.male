Water also seems to uppen your urination requirements... Anyway... if I don't complete this task now it'll be very strange or by mistake or force. So now to answer the question on everyones mind... What task tomorrow?            The Second Task            Tomorrow I will be making a story using my Lord of the Rings collectors models! It will be displayed on here!
