Here is the  urlLink Crimson  Room (sorry its in Japanese but that shouldn't matter) and the  urlLink Viridian  Room... They are these awesome Japanese Puzzle Games... If you have never played them then you must stop everything NOW and escape the Crimson Room and from there the Viridian Room.  I must thank Lynn WANG for introducing me to these two rooms... Can't wait for more rooms, I am, as we speek, working on the Viridian Room. Well I must get back to the room... I mean all this awesome homework... *wink* *wink*... Let me know what you think of they Rooms.  -Dan V
