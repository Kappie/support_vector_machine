So......lets see.......damn, I cant think cause I got that bloody song by the 5.6.7.8's in my head, you know the one, i think its called woo hoo. thats really the only words to itbut ok heres some advice for life, listen carefull these may save your life someday   If  someone is about to kill you and ask "Any last requests?" say "yes, i would like you to read the whole bible to me, in the oragional latan text."  If you and your best friend are being chasd by a hunry lion, dont try to out run the lion, just your friend.  Never send a colour blind person to cut the red wire on a bomb  To find out how many lives a cat has left, hit it with a hammer until it doesnt get back up, the number of hits it took is the number of lives it HAD.  Wood stain is a fast and attractive alternative to sun bed treatments.    There thats it for now. If anyone reads this please tell me.
