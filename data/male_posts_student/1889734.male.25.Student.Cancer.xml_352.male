The DU has an editorial endorsing each candidate (nothing like speaking clearly about your endorsement!).  Here's the one for Kucinich.  This line jumped out at me.  He has nailed women’s rights issues and garnered the support of women’s rights activists and feminists all over the country.   Is it appropriate to use the word 'nailed' in reference to women and women's rights considering the context in which 'nailed' is used in many male-only conversations?
