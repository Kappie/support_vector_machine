I'm open to hosting a double JournalCon. But I'm not sure that the current format of JournalCons (Watch TV, eat Pizza) would work well. I may be wrong. Float The West Wing by them and see what they think. I'm open to other idea (but I really don't think having them at any of the Bring-Your-Own-MovieCons is a good idea, we're pushing 24 hours of movie as it is.  Also, the Login for the calendar is your Last name, first initial, and your password has eight letters and rhymes with "assword". You can change it to meet your needs upon login.   I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.
