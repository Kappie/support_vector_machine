This admittedly successful business woman gets sentenced to five months in jail after she knowingly lied to federal officials on as to why she dumped her ImClone stock... and what does she do afterwards? She has the audacity to come out and make a sales pitch in place of her "I'm Sorry" speech. Hmph.
