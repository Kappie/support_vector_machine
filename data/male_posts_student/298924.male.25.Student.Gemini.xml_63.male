I'm getting classical music now....I think I'm about approaching the level like the dude in the Satellite DSL commercial....you know the one....where the computer says "you have reached the end of the internet..."  I beat Bionic Commando today for my classmate Ron...unfortunately he was studying for the Biochem Subject board (glad I have that next year and not this year)....Not to fear Ronny....I'll do it again tomorrow....  Oh well....back to listening to "Nothing This Funky" by Digital Underground.....ohhhhh noooo....MC Hammer- "They put me in the mix" just came on....I haven't felt like this since Ric Flair came back to WWF....
