Then again i do take that back i wasn't that anti-social when i think about it i actually did have one or two friends but they happened to be seniors who are now GONE a TRIP out of the states *tear*. I NEED TO GET A JOB and slave away at the counter somewhere. Id actually walk somewhere but there's nothing worth walking to in my area *another obese tear* I NEED A LIFE AGAIN ahhhhh. oh well.
