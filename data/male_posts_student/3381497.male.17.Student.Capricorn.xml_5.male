I just straight up called her on the phone and told her. I've wanted to tell her throughout our whole trip to NY, but I always chickened out. I knew if I waited any longer I wouldn't ever be able to do it, so I just did it. She told me she'd call me back, but still hasn't. Now I'm worried that I was a little too forward and I scared her away. I'll wait till she's ready though, she did seem very nervous after I told her. She told me she was blushing. She's so cute, If she could only see how nervous I was, I could barely get the words out of my mouth. It's probably pretty easy for some guys to say it, but if you knew me, I'm pretty shy.  It's kind of funny for a straight edge wallflower like me to like a party girl like her. I wonder how those things work out. Hey, if she ever needs me I'll hold her hair while she's vomitting on my shoes.  I'm still happy though, now that I finally got that of my chest.   Now that I think about it, she might've told me to call her. Damn I'm confused.
