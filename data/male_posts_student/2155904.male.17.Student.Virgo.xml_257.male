Tyke checked out cell phone plans for him and his family cuz they are too busy either trying to track down their lost luggage while on business in Ottawa (Dad) or they're helping out Tyke's bro with all of his moving stuff as he leaves on Saturday for D.C. (Mom).  That is basically what today was.  Tyke doing cell phones, Tyke's mom helping Tyke's brother.  Then later on Tyke went with his mom to meet Tyke's bro at Europa (the land of the Volvos) for his car's checkout before driving it 3000 miles across country.  That's gonna be an interesting trip.  40 hours of driving over 4 and a half days.  Tyke gets tired just driving to Pullman.  His brother will be driving past that and all the way to Bozeman, Montana just on the first day.  Well dinner was pretty good and then after that Tyke went back home, got ready quickly, and went back out to K-Caj's house on Mercer Island to hang out with Dr. Phil, Amed, and Macaroon.  They played Scrabble, Spider-Man, Halo, Risk, and Monopoly.  And the piano too.  But it was a keyboard so they made cool beats and Tyke is actually semi-decent at some songs on the piano.  It's just not easy to learn them without being able to read sheet music.  He has to do it all by memory usually.  He can't even do it by hearing the tune at the same time.  That just screws him up.  Tyke came home about 1 and he made pretty damn great time for coming all the way from M.I.  Not sure how long but maybe 15-20 minutes.  Average speed was supposedly 50.7 mph but it wasn't all that fast.  Yeah, he took the Avalon which is why he knew the average speed.  He didn't just make that up.  Well tomorrow involves Tyke getting his haircut which he's looking forward to cuz he hates long hair and he may not have actual long hair but it's long to him.  Short like torte.  That's what Tyke always says.
