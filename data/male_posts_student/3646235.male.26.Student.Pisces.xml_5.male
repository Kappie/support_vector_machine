Right now I'm waiting on cells to grow (arrive, actually!), and on slides.  Once I have slides, I can do a ton of experiments while I grow cells, then start all over.  It's important to plenty to do and to keep things moving.  I'm reading articles while I wait on everything else.  You know, sometimes (many times!) I don't think I know enough to actually get a job after this.  Can I keep the grants coming in?  Will the ideas keep flowing?  I have pretty good ideas, but no idea how to carry many of them out.  Lots of collaborations, I guess.  More on that later.  Word of the day: bantam - a small and feisty or quarrelsome person; diminutuve; tiny syn: miniature, small, petite, Lilliputian
