(so and so) is so nice and cute!! I read that book like right when it came out, I forgot most of it though...suffice it to say,   it's a weird book.   Rally...they were almost like white girls in black girls' bodies they danced so bad...but   TIM BROWN!!!!111one!!!1   I've never seen a famous person that close before. I still don't know how he came to American...or Fremont for that matter. Made my day though. Sucked for Basho that he lost his voice, but I'm impressed with how he put it in the best light. He used a paper to write all his messages...  kinda Memento-esque  ...  Track practice was hard-ish but satisfying when completed..."badminton boy" and Alex joined us for Camp AJ...aww, so sweet. Though Ankur and Pat were relaxing/lazy and   just sat there watching and pointing and laughing  . I'll probably never run hurdles ever. Besides, Jennifer is a very intimidating coach with the whole beater and visor and all that.   Ph33r h3r.   Yeahh...I lost 11-9 to Alex in the tournament. I could've won, but oh well. I really want to play more. Then went to Chopsticks with him...their food isn't THAT bad. The guy asked me if I had money...he was joking...right? Alex is daring, he stuck his potsticker into the soy sauce mixed with like...red orange thick paste stuff. Nasty.   And the game was boring and really sloppy and we murdered. We all thought #14 on Kennedy looked like a skinny Erik...except as Adam said,   "a little less white."   Speaking of Erik, crazy football player...but he couldn't stand sitting in the stands for 1 and a half hours straight...so disappointing. After the game Jennifer and Ankur   ripped Mr. Nelson a new...uh...  I won't even try it. And I biked home. Don't worry Kat, I didn't get run over or nothing :-D
