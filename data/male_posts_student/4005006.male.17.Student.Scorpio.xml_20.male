Nip "Oh, ok, well in that case, you go do New Sports Hall" D - ooo-kkkk..... Nip - I hope you clean as well as you did yesterday  What the...?  I must have cleaned a lot better than I thought, I'm no longer being punished, I'm not under solitary confinement anymore!! He must have been impressed....  Woo... well, today went an awful lot better than I expected thanks to all that. Bit of a high-note on my otherwise fricking fantastic life..      Oh, another thing. I'm stuck speaking in a Scottish accent... dont quite know why, but I am... hope no ones pissed off by it yet.      Laterz   Dxx
