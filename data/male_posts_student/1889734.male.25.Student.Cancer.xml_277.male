Example statements -   One of the reasons I see no reversal in this situation has to do with the way people think. At the root of this problem is the idea that "we were born in the image of god". This is the worst idea ever created by egotistical humans. Therefore we are so spendid, so special, that a being so powerful created clones of itself and gave these clones a place to live and multiply and praise the planet giver. This is all about the glory of man. So many are hypnotized by our miraculous abilities to reason, think, be aware, that they are convinced of devine intervention.   And this one -   Western religions have inspired an egotism to evolve where man believes himself worthy of his desires. This is not to say that only the religious are guilty of this behavior, or that religious people cannot be environmentalist. But the overall effect is cultural and embedded in society, and becomes the reasoning behind national political inspirations.  So I guess our destiny, in this person's view, is to live a mud farming existence, devoid of any hope to improve ourselves.  Am I reading that correctly?
