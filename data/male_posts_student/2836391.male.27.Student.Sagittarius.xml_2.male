The interviewer asked About Brooke being a Christian, and asked her whether this impacted on her music, and how.  Brooke Fraser's reply was that if being a Christian didn't impact on every part of her life, then there wasn't much point in being a Christian.  I thought this was a wonderful statement to make, and felt that it needed to be shared
