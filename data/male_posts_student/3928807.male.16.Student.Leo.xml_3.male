So I plan on smoking some weed in a field near his house before I come over, to make things more fun. Well they were playing football outside his house (they = harrison, mike, and aten) so they saw me before I could go to the field. It didn't matter anyways, because later that night I would discover that my pipe was too plugged up to smoke from. I play Risk at his house until 4:30 - at that time, I went back home.  I came home and Sam told me that Darren had called. I phoned Darren and he said he wasnt going to Mike's, so we planned for him to come to my house. Darren also called A.J, but A.J felt like staying at home. So Darren came over at around 9:00. We played Super Smash Bros. Melee for about an hour or half an hour and then we went outside, with me saying "we're going to the park to play hacky sack". We go to "the field" and we smoke three packed joints. We were already more than high enough when we smoked the third. We make our way back home and I tell Darren to imagine he is walking in one spot. That was trippy. We got home and everything was fine - I hardly had to say anything to my parents. Then we went into my room and started talking on MSN. I'm pretty sure I have never laughed that much or so hard in my life.Then I turned on the movie Memento, and Darren fell asleep before the first scene even began.  So now, today. We got up, had breakfast, watched some T.V, and then I walked Darren to the bus stop. The bus didn't come for over half an hour. I had lunch and then my parents left somewhere. I went to the shoppers drug mart and bought visine. I talked to Andrew last night and he said he'd come over to my house soon. Soon as ina few days. My parents are going to Barry's birthday party tonight (I dont think I have to go - i hope not) and so maybe I'll smoke a bit and go to Harrison's house. The only thing I'm wondering is if it's any fun being stoned and hanging out with someone who isn't. And is it shameful to smoke alone?   Tomorrow I start my first day at camp. I hope it goes well.
