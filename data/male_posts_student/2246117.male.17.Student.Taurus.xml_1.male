"I was naive, your love was like candy artificially sweet, I was deceived by the wrapping Got caught in your web and I learned how to bleed I was prey in your bed and devoured completely  And it hurts my soul cause I can't let go All these walls are caving in, I can't stop my sufferin' I hate to show that I lost control Cause I keep going right back  To the one thing that I need To walk away from..."
