Well, maybe not...I shall explain.  I have been rather negative this week.  There is really no particular reason, just in one of those moods.  Everybody has them, moods that is, at least I think they do. Anyhoo, I am sick of it.  Some people tend to be negative all the time and it gets old.  I don't want to be one of those people.  Besides, I don't have any reason to be negative. I have a roof over my head, a loving family, and a full stomach.  I was complaining earlier today that I didn't know what I wanted for my birthday. I was bitching because I have everything that I want and can't think of anything else...unbelievable. Am I really so pathetic that I can't be happy with what I do have. It almost made me sick when I realized what I was doing. There are people in this world that can't even afford to eat-what was I thinking. I should have been knocked upside the head. I need to stop being so damned negative, and be grateful. Good LORD! I am alive, that should be enough. I needed a vent.  For greed all nature is too little.      -Lucius Annaeus Seneca
