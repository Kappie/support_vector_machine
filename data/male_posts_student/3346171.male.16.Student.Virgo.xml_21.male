It'd be at 3:00 to 7:00. and i would have to work on saturday morning for getting R$150,00, God, I'd work like a slave, this kind of job you can't even stop for 5 minutes. My sister worked at a trainee company and she said tat this job is horrible. Well, what can i do?  Now i'll have to wait for another one.
