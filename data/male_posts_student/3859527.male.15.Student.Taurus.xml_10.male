If you asked me at the beginning of the year what my prospects were for the year, I would have told you 'Absolutely nothing, I think it'll be uneventful'.  Well, I did have a reason to say this.  My school year started out slowly, there was nothing to be worried about, unlike last year when I had a performance for the Queen to worry about.  However, as always, life never ceases to amaze me.  This year's more relaxed pace allowed me to meet more people; people whom I would have never spoken to in other circumstances.  And strangely enough, it is these people who have most profoundly influenced my year.  Some of them, I had great laughs with.  Some of them, I talked about humanity with.  Some of them, I froze to death in exile with.  Some of them, I've sang with.  And all of them, I'll remember.  Ah, parting is such sweet sorrow, for most of these people are in grade twelve, and have graduated.  I will miss them all, without exception.  In each of them, I see something special, a spark.  Whether that spark be for the music, for drama, for band, for art, for world issues and current events, for fashion, or for just plain ribaldry, they each hold something special within them.  I just hope that I'll know when that spark ignites into a flame.  I wish them all my best.  Good luck, it's been an honour.
