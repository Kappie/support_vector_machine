I'll have to go to the gym in 2 hours, and it doesn't make me happy at all, if my dad weren't pay for the italian class, i guess i'd quit it, however a nice body "calls atention" doesn't it?!! -how dumb!!!-   I so not think that the phisical is all, if the mind is not in shape , there 's no need for working out your biceps right?! My dad got another car, now he has a vectra. I don't understand nothing about cars. Once me and my father went out, and he left the cars, and i wanted to turn the radio on -hahahahahha- and i put the keys in and spinned it, the car made a noise and moved, i got soooo frightenned, hahhahaah, that was funny, and i'll never to that again.  PS:the movie my bro got yesterday wasn't "monsters SA", it was "just married", it's funny.
