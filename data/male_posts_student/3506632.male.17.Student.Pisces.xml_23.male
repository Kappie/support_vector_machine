First stop across that building was Jamrud Fort, a hastily yet productively built fort by Hari Singh a Sikh leader within 57 days to resist the British onslaught during 1850. A mud and stone fort with three perimeters and eleven gates it withstood the British for quite some time and in recognition they also dedicated a town to the name of Hari Singh (Haripur). Around the Fort was some sort of a base camp of which I could gather no useful details but at least can acknowledge that it was well camouflaged. Further on the Pass came the Shagai Fort, marked at its entrance by a non operational wind vane. The history of the vane, as I was told was that a senior official on his tour to some country saw many and was deeply impressed. The first thing he did on his return was to get one erected outside the fort to power it. The operational life turned out to be less than twenty four hours and ever since it is just a show piece. Further lay Ali Masjid Fort, Landi Kotal Fort and the Michni Check post after which the pass led into Afghan territory. Along the pass was also a great water supply scheme designed by the British during the colonial era in which a major reservoir was Mirza Talaab. Alas, it was ruined when the Afghan refugees came and the resultant overuse dried many springs leading to an overall shortage of water in the region. Remedial schemes include a large project at Shalmani with the crux to pump up water to Mirza Talaab. Also along the length of the pass was a dead railway and I donâ€™t know till what point was it operational as from when I started noticing it was all broken and the tunnels through which it passed were blocked by land slides.
