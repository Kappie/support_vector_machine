Nothing…He knocked again. Nothing yet again. It had started raining a few hours ago…He knocked again. No one. Perhaps no one was at home.But then the lights were on.. The rain slashed against the big glass windows of the house and the wind seemed to moan in his ears. Perhaps he should go back. He was, as it is, drenched from head to toe. He turned around hesitantly. The black, moonless night stared at him. He could see nothing for miles. This was the only house on the vast, barren moor and it stood out like a glowing pearl in the dark night.  He’d started at seven o’ clock in the evening. His search had made him cross the length of the moor several times. The moor was atop a huge hill and at the end of the infertile expanse was an unfenced cliff and a deep valley below. It was almost dusk when he’d given up his search and started looking for some place to rest. And he’d found this- a solitary house amidst the intimidating land.  Just then, a bolt of lightning flashed across the sky. The house gave a low shudder. He’d better go. He started to walk towards the front gate. He’d just opened the latch, when the door of the house creaked open. And for the first time the light from inside illuminated his surroundings. He saw an unkempt garden, a broken old-shed and at the edge of the garden was…a tombstone! Should he go see whose it is? Naah, the very idea gave him the creeps. Well, atleast he could go into the house now.  He went in to find and empty house (with lights on). He called out several times but to response only from mute walls. Well, he’d make himself comfortable. He could explain to the occupants when they came. He looked to see himself in the light…his black coat was dripping and his nameplate shimmered with water- “COLONEL J. RICE”. It had been his army instincts alone that had kept him going for the past five hours. The house thundered again and he felt a chill in his spine. He felt someone was behind him- he turned…but it was his imagination. Or maybe his hunger-he hadn’t had anything since lunch. He went into the kitchen- some bread and butter, a roast chicken, fruits…but he couldn’t eat that.No he couldn’t eat  that …   It was nearly two o’ clock and the owners hadn’t arrived yet. He wasn’t going to stay awake the whole night waiting for them, he’d explain in the morning. He went into the bedroom, took out his coat not bothering to pick up his fallen name plate.  “Ah! Sleeping on your own bed after so long feels nice…”he said to himself. Slowly, the beautiful world of dream enveloped him…   He saw himself ; a young Jeremy Rice of fifteen. His parents, his animals, the farmhouse, the big farms. CUT! He was now a Lieutenant in the Army, he saw his comrades marching next to him. CUT! He was back for the first time, after 12 years of duty, to his house. But there was no house, no farms…everything had been burnt down. Nothing was left-except a barren, vast moor…CUT! His own son, a Lieutenant had bought a house on the same moor. He was now a grandfather and his grandchildren loved him. CUT! One moonless, night he’d gone alone for a stroll on the moor. When his legs could no longer carry him, he’d rested at the edge of a cliff. He was sitting…when unknowingly two hands pushed him into the darkness…   He slept peacefully after that.  The rain had stopped and the sun shone brightly the next morning, when the Rice family drove up to their house. The kids rushed in. Major Rice and his wife went to the garden. Just then, young Jeremy (he’d been named so after his grandfather) came running with a nameplate in his hand.  ”Whose is this father?”   Major Rice looked morbid when he saw it,” Why, it’s your Grandfather’s! But how did come here? I buried it myself in his grave”.   “How did he die, father?”, asked Jeremy.  “He’d gone out one night and never returned. Fell of a cliff...or pushed as some say…We’ll never know. We didn’t find his body, so we buried his belongings.”   “But who killed him?”   “We’ll never know, son...no one knows…”     “Wow!! Cool story, Grandma!! Really spooky! Can we hear another one! Please, Grandma!! ”, said the kids. Grandmother, however, could not take it anymore…for her it was no story…for her it was the truth. She was Mrs. Jeremy Rice and her husband had gone out a few years back, never to return...She’d always dreamt of him coming back to her...to his family. She’d never lost hope…A tear trickled down her cheek. She went out of the house and picked up a blooming flower from the garden. She then went and placed it atop the tombstone at the edge of the garden. She smiled as she read the name engraved on it, “In Memory of COLONEL J. RICE- Rest in Peace”.  Bu whatever her pains, she was happy- atleast the kids had enjoyed every moment of it!   Tejas
