To sum everything up, let's do a little introduction to each of the dogs.     My dog - Mika   urlLink    Here is my dog in all of it's glory. My dog is almost 3 years old and was adopted from the shelter by me when it was 4 months old. This is quite possibly one of the friendliest dogs ever. Heres a list of FACTS! wooo!  -Female (bitchin') -Labrador/Doberman mix -Yellow eyes dark/light brown fur -Lives for table scraps...Will eat anything she see's us eating -Also lives for greeting people at the door... and very friendly with guests... sometimes TOO friendly. -Hates when I grab her feet -Would never hurt anyone except for me. (aww the love!) -Loves to go swimming in creeks, lakes, and rivers. Not in the pool.     Coco   urlLink    Here is coco walking into the computer room for the first time. He is 5 years old (I think.) and is very strong and very loyal.  -Male(ewww genitalia) -Labrador/German Sheppard/Husky and other stuff! this dog is a giant mutt! but he has alot of labrador in him. -Very obedient and smart (it can play dead!) -Loves to be pet, SUCKS UP ALOT -Very protective of his food... it's scary. -Drools alot -Also loves greeting people at the door (but mika is more anxious about it!)     How They Interact.    THE BAD      Jealousy- Coco becomes extremely jealous when I start petting Mika, and automattically pushes in. Luckily Mika has no problem with sharing anything with other dogs, so it's okay. However, I notice Mika growled at Coco when he rand infront of her as she was greeting my Dad.  Protective- Mika is not very protective of anything, she actually shares everything with no problem, however Coco is very protective of his food. I put out two bowls with their own food in each one... at first both dogs went to Mika's bowl and there was no problem, then I called Coco over for his food... Mika of course followed him... and Coco snapped, automatically the fangs were out and the deep growl came. Coco bit Mika on the ear, Mika yelped and ran away from Coco (and avoided him for a few minutes). I have made a plan to feed them one by one in diffrent spots to avoid and problems.  Hormones- Coco keeps trying to score with my dog... It's hard to keep him off her, but so far I haven't let Coco do anything to her... but it doesn't matter, they're both spayed and neutered!      THE GOOD    Friendly- Aww, they're so friendly! they play and play and play! They were always happy to see eachother before, and now they get to spend all this time together!! *awww* . They're both energetic and love playing, it's fun too watch.  Leader- Coco is definatly the leader amongst the two. Mika follows Coco's lead all the time, infact, she sits and lays down alot faster then before, she just looks at Coco and does the exact same thing. It's a good thing.  Similiar Personalities - Except for some things, they are very similiar. They are both the same size and both are mainly labradors. They both react to things in general the same way and they both listen to me in the same manner.       In General  So basicly, except for a little more noise, responsibility and plastic bags with poop in them, nothing will really change. They're both really good friends and they seem to be having alot of fun. I'm glad Coco has learned to listen to my commands and Mika has been learning to listen to me faster, looking at Coco as an example. Also, Lilo and Stitch has taught me a nifty trick. Spraying water at a dogs face and yelling "No!" is a very effective way of getting your dog to listen to you. Well I'm sure I'll have stories to tell by the end of the 3 weeks about these two beasts.
