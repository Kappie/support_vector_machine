"If A sees, B sees. If B sees, C sees. Therefore, if A sees, C sees."   It works both ways too........and can be applied to many other kai-isms.  This next one is a general observation and happens quite often.............   "Beautiful women will flock together..........ALWAYS............."   I'm not sure of the reason for this............think it's the same herd instinct that pulls guys together...............  A combination of the previous two kai-isms:   "If there is a beautiful woman, A, there will be a beautiful woman, B. If there is a beautiful woman, B, ...........you get the idea."   This explains the earlier kai-ism more simply.    "Having a lot of guy friends does not make a girl a tomboy. It only makes her a very deluded and horny girl."    I got this while reading an article on the new miss singapore universe............in fact it's something i see a lot in all this sorta articles............. I gotta make this clear..........even though probably no one is reading this,  "A girl with a lot of guy frens does not mean she is a tomboy. She is just a very deluded and insecure girl who needs to surround herself with alot of guys to assure herself that she is attractive and have power over men." No, I don't have something against beautiful women or women in general. I just feel that such people are really sad cases........    ok....stop here...........need to sleep
