Some examples would be 'Bond' and 'The Planets'. I think they are much more 'cooler' then those boy bands and stuff. They just 'class'! (I can't say that they rock) Oh well, maybe I can now find my type of music.  Talking about new age, I was watching the International Inter-Varsity Chinese Debates. And there were these Sweden and some other European University debating on whether 'Man should be encouraged to be the breadwinner of the family, while women be homemakers.' And a main point that kepy coming up was the difference between the old society or the modern society, in other words, the new age. And in relation to this, my sister (Jasmine) said that I must know how to wash dishes cause girls don't know how to these days and they won't fancy guys that can't wash dishes (whatever *rolls eyes*). What's the world coming to?!?! As much as I believe that men shouldn't look for wifes to be their maids, women shouldn't look for men to be homemakers! It's like hiring a lifetime servant with courtship, roses and that XX carat diamond ring!!! Come on, no matter how much society has changed, the fact that marriage is more than mere distinction of roles remains the same. Marriage is about feeling and life commitment, not slavery of servant-hood. Oh...I don't bother. People are just creating more problems for themselves. Humans just have to put every role or job or anything on a scale. Bad is no longer just not good. But rather, they are just like numbers representing a scale of measurement. Comparison is a way of priding  ourselves.  Ok...I got pricked by seven gigantic cactus needles. I had to pull 3 out and 1 is still stucked. This is official declaration that the most dreaded plant to me is...*drum rolls*...CACTUS!!! (Mr Cactus goes on stage) Mr. Cactus says, 'Firstly, I would like to thank Yonghan, who got pricked by my needles, without whom, I wouldn't be where I am today... ...'  Today is my sister's (Rosemary, I have 4 sisters) birthday, so hope she's had a happy day, apart from the person who approached her concerning the survey. hehe.  Ok...I'm going now. Life has been a daze. A day pasts, and time flies as fast as a Golden Snitch can fly!
