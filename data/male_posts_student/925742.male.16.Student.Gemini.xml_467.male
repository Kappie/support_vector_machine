WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ITS ELECTRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIC! Damn you Metallica, for having such a catchy song!  Second: Lets do a little talkin', baby.  On Sunday (i think), I... uh........ hm.. OH YEAH!  I met this really nice girl and we both like each other a lot, so thats some great stuff. I donno why i omitted that last post.  Hm.  She and I talk every chance I'm not sleeping or working or being busy out of my brain.  Then I did 5 hours of homework on Monday.  I finished my speecha and Biology, but have been sick for a while.  A cold or somesuch.  I don't know how I do it, but when I do something I DO it!  I'm a dedicated person, I've realized.  Heheh, that makes me feel good about myself.  I threw up this morning and couldn't sleep at all during the night.  Still, I went to school, did PE, did my Speech, took a biology test, and didn't die again in Algebra, thanks to Jake Stark.  That guy knows his Rock and plays guitar pretty well.  But the main reason for thanking him here, is that he is really friendly (ever since I befriended him last semester PE) and he is really freaking cool.  Also today he gave me these caffeine mints that perked me up the moment I took em.  I have GOT to go to compusa and get me some Bawls.  I talked to a speech partner and was really angry at myself for letting her down today, I said I would get her a camcorder, but every thing I tried didn't work.  Darn.    Alex and I worked today!  Boy I sure am glad we are working now, man!  You're gonna dig this gig.  I just hope you're fit enough.... if anything ever happens to you on the job... I would never forgive myself.  We picked up stuff, moved stuff, and cleaned stuff, same old for me.  After work, I took a MUCH NEEDED 2 hour nap.  Then I got up and apparently my mom, who was napping as well, didn't notice I came back from work and she was worried about me.   I'm glad my parents care.  She was really scared.    I'm really scared about her gall bladder trouble.  I hope nothing bad happens......  And of course I've veen here eating my food, and talking to people and writing and looking at pages I missed earlier.  Ah, I feel good that I have posted yet again.
