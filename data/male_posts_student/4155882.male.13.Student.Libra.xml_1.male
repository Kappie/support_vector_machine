(man, i've been using the word "serve" in this blog too many times...) FYI, the food is free... yes, you, the readers, read it right, it's FREE!!! the sweetest four-letter word i know in our english vernacular.... you just waltz in there and take whatever they got, just make sure you attended the sessions, which are held at different times.... after eating and after my mother and aunt talked to their friends, we made our way to our "sessions room", my brother is at a different room because the sunday school has age divisions... of course there were no room for elementary graduates so i joined my mother and aunt in the big session room...  at the middle of our pastor's preaching, christian texted me, so i replied.. (what useless things i'm putting here in this entry but oh well) i didn't tell him that i was in our sunday school so that i would have somebody to talk to except for myself... so we texted and we texted until the end of the pastors preaching... so after our session in UECP, we fetched my grandmother in a chinese drugstore and we ate at Sushiyum... and yes, you heard me right, Sushiyum not Sushiya, they're both different Japanese restaurant, another FYI... so after we ate lunch, we went home and i decided to study and finish biology once and for all for our monday's long exams... i did it after i ate dinner.... but finishing biology came at a price, i wasn't able to study technology at all!!! am i a good boy or what? and guess what, i didn't even try studying it coz i was very tired... then i slept.....  overall: it was a regular nice but not-so-special day   monday  damn... monday was full of surprises... surprises that won't make you screaming and running like an idiot, surprises in terms of unexpectedly taking very hard tests when you expected it to be a little easier... biology test was killer... i mean it would have killed me if i haven't squeezed the right answers out of my mind like i did... who cares about what happens to a potato anyway? i only know that you just slice it. cook it, eat it and THEN kill it... who cares about photosynthesis anyway? dorky scientists? not me, as if photosynthesis makes our lives easier and LIGHTer, i don't give a damn in what happens in photosynthesis... but i was able to answer the question worth 10 points about it, i'm not sure if i'll get the whole 10 points though... who cares about the ratio of the characteristics of children? the only thing i know is that the parents do something special that i would like to call  bonding, then they have a child or two or even more,  then the children inherit most of the characteristics and the circle of life takes place, the children grow up, the parents grow old and weak and die, the children would have found suitable mates and perform   bonding  and then so on..... technology test was fine, to be honest, it was very easy... so easy.... and then the values test... curse that regged test!!! curse it!!! it was the most difficult practical test i have ever layed eyes on...  overall: very bad day   tuesday      badASS!!! badass day for me...jackas* day for me also... first, i thought i had geometry all wrapped up,   but suddenly, i saw part of the test that wasn't explained by miss delmo, it was the find-the-other-endpoint thing-by using the given endpoint and midpoint.... damn, i thought i made the right formula for   the correct answer, but at recess, when i started to check my answer, it wasn't right!!! there were two numbers about that part each worth 10 points!!! you hear me?! 10 damn big points!!! hope miss delmo   gives consideration of those who exerted effort in answering that part... and if that isn't enough...   that was nothing compared to what happened in my livelihood education test!!! it was nothing i tell you!!! i forgot to check if there's a last page of the test!!! i consulted my teacher sir constatino, he said that   he'll decide to either ommit the unanswered parts or just deduct it... it was a f*ckful day...      overall: have you read anything i've written?! of course, it's obvious, today is the most badASS day ever      wednesday     just as i thought that i would get  a higher grade in the algebra test than in the geometry test, it turned the other way around... it turned out that miss estacio made several typographical errors that made my test even worse... i like our filipino test, it wasn't that hard, wasn't that easy... but still, the algebra test pissed me off!!! big time... that's why this day is one of my all-time hate-days... bigkasan practice cheered me up though... i get to spend some time with my classmates, friends and our teachers....  overall: what did you expect? of course, it's another damnful day   thursday   today wasn't that bad... it was awful... i thought the english test would be easier than the other exams but boy, it sure made me think a lot... it wasn't a no-brainer at all, the worst part is that i didn't finish the crossword puzzle part, i left 2 or 3 blanks and there were still the presence of my wrong answers... how could i be so careless... i should have studied a teenie-weennie harder... that isn't even half of it, our AP(araling panlipunan) test was a tough one also, i haven't read that much part of the book so i was kinda worried that i would screw up, and i did! but not that much... only a few mistakes... i just hated the damn darn essay... i just kept repeating my first statement until i have come up with more than 6 or 7 sentences... it was so not practical... i think... and if that wasn't enough, we had chinese classes after that...  after taking the exams, i went to the lobby with a few of my friends, we chatted, then i went to the fourth floor for our bigkasan practice, thank goodness that we hadn't practice in that deep compartment-like space in front of the computer room.... and i'm pleased to announce that we're done... we just need a little polishing little adjustments... we finished practicing at 12:40 or something.... we ate at country chicken, went to our damned chinese classes and attended another chapter of our bigkasan practice for the day...  overall: the least bad day of all the bad days, but it's still bad  5 days.... 1 good day, 4 bad days... ratio? 1:4.... meaning the bad days are dominant to the good days...  peace up, ryan here, signing out.....
