Anyway, i'll voice my opinions, and if you don't like it, comment, unless you think that i said Nintendo made the playstation. (See trblzrdom) You'll notice that i capitilized Nintendo, and not playstation, I'm a hardcore Nintendo fan, and it's not that i don't like the ps2, or the   xbox, it's just that computers are better. Hehe, I'm more hardcore about computer games, than i am nintendo mostly because of the release of DOOM 3! www.doom3.com That's really weird, it's been hyped for the last 3 or 4 years now, and now we can actually play it. w00t! I'll never get to play it though, Cube (open source fps) scared the pants off of me, google it. But if i did get it, it would be for the multiplayer, and that's only if it had bots. And also speaking of DOOM 3, (I'm quoting my good friend trlblzr here) "DOOM 3 is a status symbol[or whatever term he used], if someone asks you how good your computer is, and you respond, 'it can run doom3', you'll no doubt get some respect." Indeed.  -Methusula
