I dun wanna waste my time on frenships tt I noe wont turn out well in the end. He dun even wanna look at me or talk to me, so yea he said he dun wanna lose a great fren, but obviously he isn't tryin to prevent tt frm happenin. I'm tired of tryin to start a conversation wif him when all I get is nth but ignored. No doubt I dun wanna lose a fren as well as a brother like him, but if he refuse to talk to me, there's basically nth tt I can do. Obviously he doesn't wanna haf anything to do wif me anymore. Yea, so am I suppose to approach him when he doesn't even wanna look at me? I dun think so. So I wonder now who's the one tt's not doing his part to maintain our frenship. Well, I'm definitely not gonna try to talk to him again cuz I haf already gave up tryin. We'll juz hafta go our separate ways frm now on unless he choose to do smt bout' it. I may haf loss a good fren and brother, but he loss juz as much as well if not even more.  The day was pretty enjoyable. There were lotsa laughs wif Mal and Kumar, especially during focus. Haha. Science focus ended much earlier today compared to other days. I managed toreach home like 5:30pm, which is a pretty good thing. I did maths till dinner time and now I'm basically slackin. I'm considering if I shld do my FN, but I dun feel like doing it, so I'll probably leave it alone. Haha, I juz wanna do smt tt would make me take away all the pain and sorrows of losing a fren and bro. At the same time, I'm also thinkin if I shld make a move to ask her bout' it, but I dun think it's the rite time after losing smt tt's been there for quite awhile. Devastated, I am, but I realli do feel disappointed as well. May god bless me and may fate take it's course. All I can do now is to hope for the best as I'll leave our frenship in his hands, and his onli. Tt's bout' it for today, I'll inform u more another time. Cya.
