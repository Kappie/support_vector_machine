Law School Section Superlatives   Most Likely to Fail the Bar Exam Most Likely to Suffer a Nervous Breakdown Least Likely to Smile Most Likely to Steal Books From The Library Most Likely to Die Alone Most Likely to Shoot a Professor After Getting a Low Grade Most Likely to Get Really, Really Fat Most Likely to Become Infamous Most Likely to Be Raped In Prison Most Likely to Let His Mother Die In a Fire Most Likely to Bill 72 Hours in a Day Most Likely to Be Beaten Up in a Dark Alley Most Likely to Have a Heart Attack before Age 40 Most Likely to Work for the IRS Longest-Winded Appellate Briefs Most Likely to be Shot by a Client After an Unsuccessful Defense Most Likely to Run for Office Most Likely to Run for Office Repeatedly, Losing Each Time Most Likely to Become a Legal Writing Instructor Most Likely to Forget the Names of His/Her Children Most Likely to Default on Student Loans Most Likely to Have A Trophy Wife Most Likely to Be the Motivation Behind a Loophole-Closing Piece of Legislation Most Likely to Somehow Cause the World to End
