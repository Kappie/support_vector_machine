Bill Lockyer has ordered a chain of California private schools to stop handing out fake diplomas.  urlLink The schools taught that there were 53 states in the U.S. and 4 branches of government , and were geared towards recent immigrants with some or no knowledge of the issues. The company, which had 30 schools statewide, charged its mainly Latino immigrant students from $450 to $1450 for so-called high school diplomas. The course was based around a book riddled with factual errors.    Students learned that Congress had two houses -- the Senate for Democrats and the House for Republicans; that the U.S. flag had not been updated to reflect the addition of Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico to the "original" 50 states; that the federal "administrative" branch oversees the Treasury Department and that World War II occurred from 1938 to 1942.
