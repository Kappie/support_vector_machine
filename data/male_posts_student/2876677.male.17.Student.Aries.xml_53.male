Apparently, according to the only one that "worked", I have -30.8% body fat.  It said being 5'11 and 105(roughly) lbs. and having a 28" waist line was unhealthly.  Hey, I may be a little on the thin side but at least my stomach is flat.  Just kidding, I would rather have a little pudge(VERY LITTLE) than nothing at all.  I swear I eat all the time.  6 meals a day is what my dietician recommended.  6 meals a day and 4 sets of 10 repititions for each muscle group.  Yeah, the eating six times a day is hard enough to fit in, but working out is just not my thing.  So I will wither away and die before I graduate.  So sad.  C'est la vie.
