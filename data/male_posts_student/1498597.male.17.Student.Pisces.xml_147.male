Anyway, I haven't blogged for a while on here, so I'm pickin' off the cobwebs that are on the  P.R.E.  and dumpin' them on  Elyse's   blog ,  Step by Step .  Man, that blog hasn't been touched in a long time, sorta like its owner!  Just kiddin'  Elyse .  Anyway, time to blog.  Well, in case you idiots didn't notice, we're fuckin' outta school!  Well, I'm not as excited as I was, say, two days ago, but yeah, summer vacation has been really great so far and I'm makin' sure that it stays that way!  Some more good news is...I got my  yellow card  from  RCC .  It was really ironic, cuz I got it on  Tuesday , the day that I got off of school.  Hmm, a letter of approval to begin attendin' another school when you just got off school.  Anyway,  I'm still awaitin'  Nick's  answer on whether we should go or not.  I really hope we do go, but it is his decision.  Still, I hope he says what I wanna hear!  OK...projects that are bein' worked on.  Let's see...plans on  Operation: Revolution  are still bein' worked on.  I just gotta figure out how I'm gonna do all that crap and still continue to talk about contraversial stuff.  I think I can do it, and its worth a try I guess.  Next up is  The Big Black Book of Baffling Bullshit .  I haven't started workin' on that much, but I will soon I guess.  There are just so many jokes, I dunno how I'm gonna remember 'em all!  I'll try guys!  Well, thats about it for now.  No one is online, so there isn't anybody to fuckin' talk to...shit.  Well, I'm just gonna go blog for the  T.E.W.  then.  I'll try to blog about authority sometime...when I feel like it.  More to come...!
