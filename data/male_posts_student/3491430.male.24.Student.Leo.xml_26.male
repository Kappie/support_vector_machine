So the weather is really hot and sunny everyday. Sometimes, i go to swimming pool. Motoi i'm going to buy a laptop because of my frequent travels now. It was hard to sell all the components just few days before leaving Sweden. So i think i will buy a Sony... If you want the reference : Sony vaio VGN-A115B. I think, it's a really good one. We don't have so much news about Julien and Lyu. It would be nice to have some even if Lyu uses Yan to keep in touch.  Well i will try to send some pictures later... Aurelien is going in Singapour soon, on saturday more exactly. I will join him the 13 of august. And today on french tv there is a transmission about Singapour on the afternoon. So Motoi when are you coming in France ? And Yan and Lyu ? And Julien ? I'm wainting for you all ! My family...
