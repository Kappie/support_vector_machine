Fear not, however, for it will be sanitized, or so they say.    From the Yahoo! report:    "TBS is promoting 'five nights of great sex,' and will air two of the series' best episodes each evening through Saturday, starting at 10 p.m. EDT. The network will begin showing all 94 episodes this summer, in order from the first to the last."  Is it really possible to sanitize something that is utter filth?  For example, have you ever heard of anyone who said "I'm going to clean my dirt now."  Of course not!  If someone sanitizes "Sex And the City" correctly, there will be nothing left.  That would be a good thing, but the very fact that the series is going to air is proof that it hasn't been sanitized enough.    Good thing it's going on TBS; I imagine its moral depravity won't be too big of a stretch for that station.  Rather, it should be almost par for the course.
