Props to Frank for his beautiful catch, as well as disabling one of my best team mates, you are a worthy competitor.  I'm in support of JKo throwin a bitchin going-away party for Clark, and maybe next year we'll orginize a road trip to kick it with her in sea-town.  For any of you who enjoy the debates we sometimes have in class, I recommend you give Model United Nations a try.  I did, really enjoyed, and was fairly successful in my first competition.  Debate and compromise are great skills to develop, and MUN is an excellent medium for that.  Props to the Russian Federation on their team victory, and good job to everyone else that participated as well.  Love Rob
