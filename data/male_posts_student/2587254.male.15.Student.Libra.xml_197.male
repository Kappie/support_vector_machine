Not much happened today, and after yesterday's post, I'm a little bit lazy, so here's a summary    -woke up  -was late for worship practice (Carmen was apparently the first one there today)  -English service (studied Jeremiah today)  -Bible study (studied Daniel 6, the famous lion den story)  -Home  -Not much since (some SC, chatting, usual stuff)    Yup....that pretty much sums it up. Now Shoo.    Oh wait, actually before shooing, here are some quotes I leave you with....    Gavin: "YOU SMELL SO BAD YOU MADE SPEED STICK SLOW DOWN!"  Dan: "YOU SMELL SO BAD YOU MADE RIGHT GUARD TURN LEFT!"    OOOOOOOH SIU. Anyways I'm out.    Later.
