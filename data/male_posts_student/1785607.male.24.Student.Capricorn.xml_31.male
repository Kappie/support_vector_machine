Madonna.     And at the end, you weren't the one... well, I was not the one....! I can't cry no more... too painful... I just wish you the best and don't get out of my life... you know what? I just don't know... it hurts so much.    Pride can stand a thousand trials, the strong will never fall But watching stars without you, my soul cried. Heaving heart is full of pain, oh, oh, the aching. 'Cause I'm kissing you, oh. I'm kissing you, oh. Touch me deep, pure and true, gift to me forever 'Cause I'm kissing you, oh. I'm kissing you, oh. Where are you now? Where are you now? 'Cause I'm kissing you. I'm kissing you, oh.   Kissing you. Des'ree.
