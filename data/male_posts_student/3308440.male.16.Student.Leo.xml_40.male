Well that's that done...  Today has been fairly fun... from what I can remember of it I went to work and did an extra lesson helping and then went back home, I have been tired today it's my fault really staying up late a couple of days ago and then last night going sleep to be woken up by my phone going off, which after that I struggled to get back sleep, so I think the rest of the night holds rest for me ready for work again tommorrow.  See Ya  Dan :)   Current mood: Exausted  Currnet music: The verve - Bittersweet Symphony
