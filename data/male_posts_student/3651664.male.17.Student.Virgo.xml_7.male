This song has been used many times by the Democrats, including during the 1976 election to push black voters to vote for Jimmy Carter. Doesn't this say anything about the man they want elected? Do they really want another Jimmy Carter for president? Heck, the Democrats didn't let Carter anywhere near a DNC stage for 20 years because he was such an embarassment. The only reason he was back this year is that a lot of today's voters weren't around to see what an embarassment he was. Perhaps these people should have stayed in school, gone to college, and gotten a real job. Then they'd understand how ignorant they really are.
