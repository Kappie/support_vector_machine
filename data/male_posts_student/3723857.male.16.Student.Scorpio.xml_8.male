Not much time before the promos arrive.. I actually wanna form a study group.. but I can't seem to find anybody.. Well the one I really really wish that could partner with me would be her already.. but I think she's angry wif me.. she hasn't replied to my sms in which I apologised and asked whether we could still be friends.. speaking about that.. I really feel that we should just be friends first.. then see whether we still can continue from there or not.. after all I love her whole-heartedly.. but she doesn't like me.. so I'm just waiting for her.. yup I know she's in love with someone else already.. but I still can't help it.. and who cares anyway.. Love is blind right? =)  Haha I dunnoe what our outcome will be.. I'll try to be friends with her first.. do you know how paiseh I am? I'm too shy to even look at her.. hope she doesn't mistake it as being cold to her and daoing her.. and that means I've gotta muster all my dignity and courage to speak to her.. and I'll really cry if she doesn't respond >.  Quote of the day:    Love is the greatest power in the world.
