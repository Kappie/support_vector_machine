When you come from desperate poverty, and that's exactly what I come from, you know that nonsenses are not to be tolerated. I'm not sure who gains from chaos, but I know it's not the poor folks in the council flats. The politics of vindictiveness is never, ever anything like a solution."  "The sheep who buy Korn and Limp Bizkit . . . they're completely, utterly foolish."   "There isn't no such thing anymore. That's something that happened way back in the late 70s. Historically, that's where it belongs. You gotta move on. Anyone imitating that now in the 90's is a bit of a fool. You should have your own thing and stop looking up to Granddad."   - Johnny Rotten, retiree of the Sex Pistols
