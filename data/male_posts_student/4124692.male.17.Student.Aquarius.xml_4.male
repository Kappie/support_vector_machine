I mean come on, it makes its money off the back of relentless promotion and distribution of (mostly crap) music, pursues its crusade against the p2p'ers out there, pushes for laws to tighten intellectual copyright and all in the name of equality and fairness. As if those "artists" are'nt rich enough already. Well, you guilt ridden people, buy your cd's and continue to oil the cogs of the capitalist machine.  But just remember, consumerism costs lives, as the hilarious subvert points out.
