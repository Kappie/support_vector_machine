I mean, she tells me to call her, so I do. The only problem is that she NEVER PICKS UP, and even when she is home she stil doesn't return my calls. It's called common courtesy people.      Anyway, getting back to the whole Jenna thing- we went to Al's on a hunch that she'd be working. She wasn't. That didn't stop us from eating 9 dollars worth of french fries and "onion nuggets" (SOOOOO GOOD!) Fortunately, I didn't eat all day just in case, so I didn't have any guilt ;^p After that, we went back to her house and watched  Bring It On.  OH! and we changed Jenna's message on her phone. It's awesome. Every single one of you MUST call her phone and hear it. I'm not joking.         Well, I must be off. I have to go pick up the sushi I'm having for dinner. Sushi=Joy.   *hugs*
