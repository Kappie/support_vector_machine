And it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else.   And it's so hard to do and so easy to say.  But sometimes - sometimes,  you just have to walk away - walk away.   With so many people to love in my life, why do I worry about one?  But you put the happy in my ness, you put the good times into my fun.   And it's so hard to do and so easy to say.  But sometimes - sometimes,  you just have to walk away - walk away and head for the door.   We've tried the goodbye so many days.  We walk in the same direction so that we could never stray.  They say if you love somebody than you have got to set them free,  but I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and misery.  They say time will make all this go away,  but it's time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays.  And once again that rising sun is droppin' on down  And once again, you my friend, are nowhere to be found.   And it's so hard to do and so easy to say.  But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away, walk away and head for the door.  You just walk away - walk away - walk away.  You just walk away, walk on, turn and head for the door.
