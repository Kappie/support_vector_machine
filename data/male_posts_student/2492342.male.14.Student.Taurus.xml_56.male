I went to history..the test was fine..after all, i was writing stuff for it for 4 hours last night, blowing off every other subject. so i ditched PE, did my math hw there...spanish was fine...then in sex we got int rouble cause we stayed around the class instead of going somehwere else(the comp lab for the librarians speech er soemthing) and then we went after she sent someone and we walekd really slowly so miss allen said shed give us all tardies. ggrreat. then we ran.  that was boring..math was fine..i found out i ddi double as much hw as i shouldve, but its good cause the other stuff is due next class.   this is the part where i get beat up...u can skip it if u dont liek graphic scenes...lol   lunch was fine.until...well, animal rights was ok, but we were kicked out of our room so we went to blaney patio..where lunch time theatre was....it was like 6 people yelling..so the meeting ends....and hal walks over..and me, sara, and sam talk to him....then they leave us and i start walking...hal takes my sweater..i cant remmber why, but we were fooling around...and then i find it again. so we walked back to high school and i pretend to hit him(i miss everytime, purposely) with my sweater...then after the third time, while im jsut laughing, he turns aroudn pissed and tells me to give himt eh sweater and hell make me go find it(he hid it before and then helped me find it) so i said no..i didnt really expect him to be serious...so he grabs it and pushes his fingers his fingers into my neckand pushes me to the ground..i dont let go of it, i like the weater..but im able to like puch him back(it really hurt!) and run to the lock back hall.....so he has his finger sin my neck like half the time until ifall to the floor, still clutching my sweater...then i put my nails into his hand until he lets go, at which point i quickly twist the hand he had on my neck back and he gets a little hurt(dont forget my pain, yeah?) and then i get up and run to where sarah is...i quickly mumble soemthing to her but then he swings this huge, hard lunchbox into my head!  what the fucking hell? how first grade is this???  and sam and sarah are like oh my god, cause that fucking hurt(sorry for the language). and imlike yeah im fine(i blacked out quickly, so i didnt feel it that much) and hes like if sarah wasnt standing there, id hit u again. what the hell?  this boy is messed up!  sarahs like 'my god, hal!' and hes like 'look at my hand!' (i dont cut my nails often, so their often longer than most people and i dug them in a bit while his hand was on my neck, i wanted to get the hand off)  who the hell cares about your hand? aria did when he showed her and explained how i attacked him..lol..  well, anwyays, i run to the library and he stops outside. THANK GOD i had a free period. i stayed there with joe for a while.   it turns out, hal is really agressive. hes been depressed a while because hes had bad grades, and hes really good karate er whatever, so he punched joe last week for no reason(in the eye..thats serious) and has randomly walked up to him and hit him.   so anyways...i get to english(last period..with him uck) early and sit inside with sam o. and talk to her...he walks in and says 'im gonna kick your ass after class'  go to hell, hal.  and i say 'why?? whatd i do?' ' you dug your fingers into my hand'. and what the fucking hell were you doing the whole time??  so i watch the movie and give notes to sarah and joe about it....we rush out afterwards and get out of the main area after i get my books..he took a while to get out..i guess he gave up on the idea.  but joe wanted to go to mr o'brien's office(principal) since hal and punched him, and i siad what the heck. lets go  so sarah leaves once we get to the office and wait til he can take us..and it works out. the minute i walk out, i see my grandma, and leave school to go to her house and study bio. she used to teach it.  END BEAT UP lol  what kind of messed up say is that?  my wrist couldnt fully move and my neck still hurts when u bend it. uck.  anyways..i studied..then came home, talked to ceci about life..  tried to look up one of her old people..the first family that let her work when she first came. couldnt find anything on michael froly/frolley or sally same last name.  too bad.  and i end this sadly  much love  peace  ~alex
