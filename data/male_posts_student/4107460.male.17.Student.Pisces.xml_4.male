I missed her bad for the longest time and wasn't interested in seeing anyone else. No other girls at my school or that I know appealed to me I had either already dated them or didn't want to. The city and county high schools have merged into one now and there is a whole new selection of girls. Yes there are several gorgeous girls here, but do we have anything in common. Yes!!!! I am extremely stocked about my date with one of the most beautiful and intelligent blondes I have ever met. I've now found that moving on and getting over my X is going to be a lot easier.
