If it does fall apart,  sea level rises would be enormous   -Global average  temperatures are predicted to rise by between 1.4C and 5.8C by 2100   -Increasing temperatures means the World is likely to see  less frosty days and cold spells , but we are expected to experience  an increase in heat waves and hot spells   (but this is good, right? for guys cos girls....yah :D) -Greater risk of  drought  in summer in continental areas  - Hurricanes  likely to be more intense in some parts of the World due to  more rainfall and more intense winds   - Itâ€™s not clear what will happen with thunderstorms or tornadoes   -An intensification of the  Asian summer monsoon  is expected  -There is no evidence for changes in the frequency, intensity or location of  tropical storms  Storm surges  are expected to increase in frequency and in the UK the south east coast is expected to see  the largest surges at around 1.2m higher than we have now.      "The Arctic is warming. Air circulation around the North Pole region has changed. It is bringing warmer, wetter winters to northern Europe, Siberia, and parts of North America. Also, a changed wind pattern is moving young Arctic ice out of the ocean faster."      "Be prepared: sudden shifts in climate coming  Data from ancient tree rings and ice cores suggest Earth may soon experience intense periods of drought and cold."     well. scary isnt it. but i guess we would all be dead by then. or really really old. well, if you're bored and you have nothing to do, i suggest you should go and check out this website.  urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/  its about leonardo da vinci, i found it interesting, will you?
