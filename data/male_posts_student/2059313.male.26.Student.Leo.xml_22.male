But what really is the kicker here, is how people will send you a million forwards, but when you write them, it's too much for them to write back... takes too much time, I guess.  All I ask for is someone to e-mail me something with a little more substance.  Even superficial substance would be fine.  I'm not looking to be deep over the internet, just want to know how my friends lives are going and what they're up to and in to.  Too much to ask? The world may never know.
