No doubt, participants are the better ones in Mathematics. I don't expect Gold. But i certainly want my SilvER! It's  dream come true. I have been waiting for 1 year? I missed my softball training to attend this competition, some sacrifice.....Anyway, Our C Boys Nationalz are coming. I look foward to the day we play our very 1st game. I am also looking foward to the day we get Nationalz 1st. Since Ri and Chinese High, the 2 big Guns are down this year. We must make use of their downfall. On the other hand, Catholic High and PeiCai have improved alot.
