Instead of creating an anonymous comment, I decided to create a new account to counter his  radical  opinions and flash my ego at the same time. Nevertheless, with this, hopefully I'll burn two down...      As much as I agree with his points regarding one's personal choices throughout life, I have some comments to make about his literary creation. Primarily, I believe that the reason someone bothers another about their smoking habit depicts that the non-smoker cares about the smoker's newly-acquired tobacco tastes. I do not believe that individual's  bothersome  suggestions should be outright ignored. Thinking about it from the oppostive point of view, do you honestly believe that someone wants to nag about a smoker stopping day in, day out? Clearly, there is some reason they are so bothersome. However, I have rethought my approach to others and will not fiddle with their strings any longer. My new  foreign  policy plays out as follows:      I am going to go about my non-smoking ways as I have always gone about them, simply to not smoke. My new, fresh hobby will clearly make me stronger, faster, and more tolerant to much more than smoke. Therefore, smoke away with happiness tobacco consumers. I more so enjoy the smell of money than  filtered  smoke. My smoke-free life is just as relaxing, just as happy, just as enjoyable.      However, I'll post some positive feedback to his poesy. I respect his ability to make mends to non-smokers by offering his suggestions.      "Ifa does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he has arrived at an obstacle."
