Today I met Marcus I thought he would be more dweeby, but thankfully he's not.  Jamie, Chris and that other guy were there too. I also met miles on the way back from getting drinks. He used to be a dumbass in school, but now he's doing better which is good, because he works really hard. It was so funny today, more jokes and laughs and the twins started fighting, its like someone arguing with themselves. This was cool I drank so much Soda  ate so heartily, hopefully next week will be like this.
