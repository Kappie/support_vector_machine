Renee Zellwegger kicked ass and earned all the awards she has won and/or will win on Sunday, Nicole Kidman was pretty and sad, Jude Law was sad and died, and Natalie Portman made a stirring appearance as the widowed and lonely mother of the world's largest baby. (It looked about half the size she is, probably partly 'cause she's so small.) She cried and then was almost raped and then shot a guy. Hooray. Jude Law is cute but not so much so with a beard. That's about all I have to say about that.  LC Players sucks. More on this later.  If I'm going to read The Other Side of the Corndog, or whatever it's called, somebody has to tell me exactly what it is. Either no one's ever said or I've missed it somewhere.  But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'
