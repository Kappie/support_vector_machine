Depending on the country you are, you will get a certain amount of food for breakfast.  For the United States, this is akin to a dozen donuts and a gallon of orange juice.  For Tajikistan, this means two spoonfulls of grits.    We tried this in high school once.  The Spanish department worked to teach a bit of economics, considering the chair of the department was getting his Ph.D in Econ.  For one week, we were to play the part of either a Mexican nobleman, a Mexican working man, or a Mexican impoverished man.  There were 28 in the class; 21 were impoverished.  One was rich.  The rich guy dictated what we did in class, sat in the comfy chair, ate Snickers bars during class, and had a hall pass to do whatever he wanted for the day.  I was one of the middle class guys...it was class as usual for me.  The 21 impoverished sat in a corner right next to each other, some having to stand because there was not enough space for all to sit, and at at times they would be told to do some ridiculous task.    This lasted two days.  The first day was the introduction day.  The second day was the first day where we played the roles of our people.  Casey Young, the Student Council President, was one of the impoverished.  Casey was the first bit of drama I ever got to know...usually chipper and friendly, I slowly realized that her statements were usually to get herself noticed, and the gossip was always glorified...but she gave me back rubs and had great boobs, so we were cool.  This day, however, her cakehole never shut.  "Mr. Wesson, this is unfair.  He gets to sit in your chair and I have to stand here?  This is unfair!  Unfair!"    The Student Council president bitched to such a degree, both in class and outside, that before the end of the day the simulation was ended.  Whiny high school students in Rogers, Arkansas beat out the first initiative by the language department to work in an interdisciplinary manner rather than teach from the book.  We returned to bookwork the next day.  Casey still hated the Mexicans because they lived in ugly houses.
