I woke up to the rain hammering against my window. It cleared while I was having a shower, though, and I went into Pates at lunchtime (I caught the 94, finding it actually doesn't stop THAT near Pates... damn), and Fi was v. happy to see me (I'm not sure whether this was the main highlight, but it was lovely, and Fi's great, so wuvoo Fi), and so Dave, Fi, Todd and I (wait for it)... toddled off to the music room, where Fi and then Dave showed off their piano skills. Rebs and Celia came in, which was cool, cause I think Rebs doesn't hate me, same with Celia. Then Nikki came in, which was cooler still. As I left I got a nice hug from Fi and Nikki kissed my shoulder *confused look*. Ooh, and Lizza (not Becca, as I said on the previous post about her, sorry, it's LIZZA) gave me a nice hug too, and she rules. One of these days Lizza and I are going to actually get to know each other! Anyway, saw Libby on the way out tooo, and she gave me a hug too. Good time for hugs. She trundled off to find Tobin.  OK, so, thought was "Ah, that was nice, so, off to town to be bored for an hour or so until the practice". I was wrong, thankfully. I saw N'omi and Rose, Chris, and... Laura in town. Seriously. Laura scared me to hell, though, she ran up behind me as I was going into Regents' Arcade and tapped me on the back. Almost gave me me a heart attack. But still, after almost having an attack, my heart did that cartoon thing where it came out of my chest. Well, no, but you know what I mean. Then went to Shez's with t'band. That was cool, it went OK, and we did a thrash version of Living on a Prayer! W00t! Oh, and I walked home with Segye, and we made fun of car number plates - example: L296 TVA became the squadron car for the Transvestites' Association. Yay! Then after I got back I got a reply to my email to this oh-so-cute woman on Facebattle, who thinks I'm her 'perfect guy' and I await being able to talk to her on AIM... w00t. Seriously, she seems cool... really pretty... yay!  That's purely people-based; I also bought Maroon 5's single version of 'This Love', which rocks, and I've now got the video of it as a result of it being on the CD, and that rocks completely and utterly... and the 2 bonus tracks rule too. I also got Michael Jackson's 'Off The Wall' ...he was still black when he made that... I dunno, it's not sooo great but then I did get it for Â£3.  The only mild marr on the day was the fact that the prawn mayo sandwich I got from Woolworth's wasn't great...  Quote of the day: "I'll fix these broken things Repair your broken wings And make sure everything's alright..."  From Maroon 5's   This Love   Love, Jon Roskilly
