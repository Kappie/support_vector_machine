Jorick had borrowed me A 8.0 Naish X3 just in time, and I borrowed a board from a friend of mine, but I haven't kitesurfed there, because it was too dangerous. every morning the wind was blowing to the west, but after a while it turned from west to east, in 5 min., and that 10 times a day... But it was great anyways, the weather was great, and I had a great time. Special thanks to jorick for borrowing that kite!
