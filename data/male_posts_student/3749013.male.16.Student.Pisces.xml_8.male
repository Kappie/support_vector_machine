I told myself early in the morning that I must hand it personally to her, and not to pass it to her through someone. I managed to hang on to the cd till 1.50, then, I saw her walking down the corridoor alone. Previously, I was still panicking, I said to myself,:"WHERE IS SHE!!!" I popped into her class, asked (friend M) where was she, then he told me that she went to the foodcourt. When I thought that I would not be able to pass her the cd personally, miraculously, she appeared. I passed the cd to her, she said the cutest "THANK YOU!!!", then she returned to her class, I rushed to my physics lesson...  I've finally got the chance to get closer to her during today's 'cutlet outing'... Actually, it's not 'cutlet outing' anymore, it's more of a 'food gathering' as the bloody owner of the western food stall is bloody slow in preparing food nowadays... Today, I treated her 'chai tow kuay' and drinks, willingly, of course. Just to watch her eat was already a joy, let alone watching her eat for the whole half hour. Because of our tuition, (friend C), (Friend T) and me had to leave, unwillingly for me though.  During tuition, I was thinking about her, every second. Thinking about the way she talked, her actions, the way she ate, hell, almost everything about her.  I took 22 home, just to accompany (friend C), due to the stupid location of his home. But thinking back, I have to thank his father for moving there. When I alighted the bus, to my surprise, I saw her with her friends, waiting for their bus home. This is so bloody coincidental, it's just like my prayers have been answered. I went up to them, said hi, then offered to accompany them while waiting for their buses. She suddenly asked me why didn't I help her write the song titles of Jay's new album for her, I, personally know how corrigable my handwriting was, couldn't possibly destroy, what is, her property is it? Fortunately, I brought the original lyrics to school today for a little reference, little did I know that it was one of the best stupid choices I've made in my life. I offered her to take home my copy. WOOT!!! We waited for around half an hour, with them letting a couple of their home-bound buses go without even responding. Finally, or rather, sadly, they boarded one of their home-bound bus home. Then, while walking home with the friend she held back at the bus stop, I asked him exactly how many buses they purposely missed. His reply was astounding, a whopping 20 buses...  Well, the money spent today had not gone down the drain, luckily. At least now I know that she dislikes egg yolk, which I would definitely take note of it. But if the treating keeps going on, I'll definitely go broke before the end of the month. Let's hope that miracles do happen like today, more frequently.
