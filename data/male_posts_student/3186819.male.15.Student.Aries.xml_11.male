For years it has been available but it seems as though it only becomes common knowledge once you enter high school. You can make it so that every one is aware of every one else on the line or some ppl can be "mute" so they can hear everything but the, well victim, doesn't know theyr'e there. Of corse i am somewhat scared that someone could do the same thing to me, sit there as a friend and ask me what i thought of other ppl while that person may be right there listening. I am a lousy liar but i do "edit" what I'm going to say and to whom I say it. Not really in a bad way, and I'm not changing what I say, I merely try to be tactful to the person I'm speaking with. The magic of "three waying" is that that guard can be down for one person making you soooo vulnerable to the others eagerly hanging off of each and every word you utter. It's fantastic. So, the moment you let your guard down to that friend who is oh so nice and thoughtful, maybe even crying with you, be aware. It's not what that thoughtful person has to say that matters, It's the silence that you should really be concerned about. -By Tanya
