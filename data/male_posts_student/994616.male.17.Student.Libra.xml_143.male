I just finished watching urlLink The Simpsons  it was pretty good, they even had  urlLink Ian McKellan  and the chick that wrote  urlLink Harry Potter   My dad got his  urlLink BMW  today it was a  urlLink 318I  pretty nice except its in the ugliest white colour. I looked at a  urlLink Mini  today. It was blue with a black roof. It also had a sun roof and funky wheels. I'm getting it off (not in THAT sence) the hottest guy, well at least an 8 and I know he's  urlLink gay  because he was wearing a  urlLink Fendi  watch. His name was... wait for it... Colin!!! Y'know like the totally dreamy  urlLink Colin Farrell  *swoons*  I'm mildly irritated with  urlLink Yahoo!   urlLink mail  I can't use it from a  urlLink POP3  email  urlLink client    I had an idea for  urlLink emoticons . I thought that the eyes should be based on which you use; colon or semi colon etc. that way you could have a wink and a smile or a wink and a frown etc. IT wouldnt be that hard to do, contextual smiley faces, I like.   I'm going to take a break to watch  urlLink The Resort  on  urlLink Channel Ten . Back, I got bored half way through and left, it definately wasnt ass good as the first episode. But I think that's because the first episode focused more on the people. Thats why I heart  urlLink Big Brother    Speaking of  urlLink OutKast  (on  urlLink Caroline 's blog) I really like the new song  urlLink The Way You Move  it has an odd video clip. Buy yeah I agree with caroline  urlLink Hey Ya!  is awesome too. Oh and just because i think people need them here are some good music pages  urlLink Launch  Video clips and general info  urlLink iTunes Link Maker   urlLink IGN Music  I usually disagree with their reviews so I dont know why I'm recomending them  urlLink Rolling Stone  The quintessential music mag  Oh and relating to  urlLink Caroline 's entry again, this time about the  urlLink iPod .  urlLink Caroline 's getting one, I've got one Dodds' got one,  urlLink Jenny 's getting one, Mick's getting one and Evan might be getting one. Now I see why everyone's talking about how great they are, and I see why  urlLink Apple 's releasing the iPod mini! I totally heart my iPod, I have all my phone number on there just incase my phone isnt with me. The second best thing about the iPod (First being the scroll wheel) is definately  urlLink iTunes .   32, Can't Touch This! (I feel so MC Hammer)
