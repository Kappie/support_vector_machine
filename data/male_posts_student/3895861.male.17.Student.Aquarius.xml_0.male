That is what it sounds like, right? Well that initial analysis is wrong. It is about ppl having sex with dolphins. yah. intimate desciptions. eeeewwwwwww.  I have spent alot of time, since my last post, tho not nemore, at the following site:  www.johntitor.com  that is an interesting site, lemme tell ya. it is about this guy (if it is real, it is a guy) who says he is from the future. He says he is from the year 2036. He cruised some forums, and largely ppl sed he was dumb or asked him for stock tips/sports scores/near-future news. He dint tell ne of that. He sed he dint remember soem of it, but also he sed that it would be immoral to tell some stuff that ppl could makemoney on, i suppose that is right. Some just asked him for the big stuff. The big stuff he talks aboot is the civil war that is supposed to start this year/next. it will turn into WWIII not long later. I hope he's wrong, but I can't say I'd be terribly surprised if he is right. There are pics of his time machine and stuff. It is a very cool site, whether it real (prolly not) or fake (prolly is).   This site is not terribly bizarre, but i still want u to go there. It is pure art.  www.lodger.tv  It is a fun little site. They have flash videos of a kind I have not seen before. The ppl are kind of like stick figures, but they are better described as the ppl from public signs (liek the ones in the wheelchair spaces in parking lots everywhere). The main characters are male almost (if not, then totally) exclusively male. This makes them of much gr8er impact to a male audience, if u ask me, but I think females would enjoy the site, too. The best stuff on the site is the videos, I LOVE DEATH is my favorite--it is awesome. Half (two) of the vids are for selling something, but they are still good. Play the game, there are stick figures giving head in it.  NEXT! I had the brilliant idea (which I stole from jen borg) of talking to myself on AIM. All you have to do is add your own s/n to yer buddylist. Then all u do is waste a huge corporation's bandwidth. this is fun, but i have recently found something even more fun. If u add ZolaOnAOL and/or SmarterChild, (there are others, but those r my favorites) then u ken talk to a computer which is programmed to respond to u as tho it were a (somewhat conservative) person. It is fun to pass some time with it.  tuoderredout: are you gay? SmarterChild: Why do you care? tuoderredout: I want to know if you're gay. SmarterChild: Tell me more. tuoderredout: Do you type with a lisp? SmarterChild: Sure. I guess.  The fun goes on forever.  tuoderredout: hello ZolaOnAOL: Hi again! Got any weekend plans? tuoderredout: I plan to wank. ZolaOnAOL: Do you think that this plan will succeed? tuoderredout: Yes! ZolaOnAOL: "Do you think that this plan will succeed"? Yes? tuoderredout: yes ZolaOnAOL: Is there an echo in here? tuoderredout: no ZolaOnAOL: Good you stopped repeating me. tuoderredout: indeed ZolaOnAOL: Indeed it is so. tuoderredout: yes ZolaOnAOL: Next question? tuoderredout: How much wood would a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood? ZolaOnAOL: A whole forest.  I found something similar on www.bored.com once. I can't remember the name of the bot. It was fun, tho.  http://www.dancingbush.com/  Make Dubya dance. The site is really kind of boring. It jsut made me think. I thought for a second that it may have taken a little time to find an acceptable body for G Dub on that flash. Then it hit me. All white ppl look the same. especially politicians, b/c they all dress the same (not cheap, but also not expensive suit, blue or red tie). That also got me thinking about this one guy form the NAACP who sed sumtin nasty and racial to Nader (sumtin liek he is jsut another cracker [that is how NAACP ppl say it--cracker not cracka] that wants to tell blacks what to do, he might be right). Which mad eme tihnk aboot how some white ppl say that all blacks look the same. I dunt think so. I think that asians look very similar to each other. I dont expect them to know the difference between a german and an austrian, so i dunt think they should get terribly offended when i dunt know whether they are chinese or japanese. Many also dislike being called "oriental". I dutn understand y, it is not meant to be bad or anything. It is also a term that differentiates them from indian or pakistani ppl. that reminds me of that movie "booty call" where, for most of the movie, two guys are hunting down condoms and shrink-wrap for use on their GFs. A guy beihnd the counter of a conveinience store say "CALL ME A PAKISTANI, WILL YOU?" as he pulls ot a huge shotgun, and his co-worker (also indian). pulls out an automatic. This I understand, India use to be what is now India, plus pakistan, and it use to be owned by Britain, so they were grouped together, same laws and all (Pakistan is mostly muslim, very conservative and india is mostly hindu, where there are sculptures of penises at some streetcorners for worship) for a long time b4 a mutual separation that led to, among other things, years of war between them, and nukes in both countries. Call an Indian a Pak-man, he should be offended. Call A Germ a Pole, he should be offended. Call a Japanese a Korean, it dunt matter. china-japanese confusion, ok that i admit i understand, japan has whopped china's ass so many time it aint funny. Especially when u tihnk aboot the numbers involved here. China= at least 20% of the entire world's population vs. Japan= all the ppl u can fit onto an average-sized island chain.    Can you still say "Put it where the sun don't shine" on a nude beach? I mean seriously, there are no tan lines or nething, so i dunt think there is a place where the sun dunt shine. I would not go to a nude beach. I bet it is all perverts there. Would I fit in? prolly. Would I be happy i fit in with a bunch of naked pervs with binoculars and cameras? noper. I dunt even think I wouldn't even go to euro-peon nude beaches. I thikn it is best that msot ppl are clothed when I see them. That is including the fact that europeans are not as fat as merikens (ppl from merika, where we live, ppl have been calling it that since bush has been slurring it). It isn't really trure that the grils dont shave thier pits, most do. they dunt shower so often, tho. Also, they are more laid back about drinking. In Germany, beer can be drunk (ppl can be drunk, too!) at 16, and harder stuff at 18. also, many euros drink hard liquor b4 they eat dinner. I know for a fact that greeks, italians, and scandinavians do. It happens often enough that Coca-Cola makes a drink that tastes like everclear (a lil' different, more liek ouzo), but is not alcoholic. don't believe me? It's called Beverly. I have had some. The dutch are portrayed as being laid back on some things, liek weed and prostitution (b/c it is legal and regulated there). But really, they are tighter on those things than even the US, which spends billions (with a "b" or a thousand million, a million dollars is the produce of a person's entire life--think about it, they are spending the produce of a person's life thousands of times over) on a FAILING drug war. It is easier to get weed than alcohol, if you are under age, think aboot that. U know it is true if u have had ne. Sometimes, it is even easier than cigs. Holland boasts the fact that 1/3 fewer teens use pot, now that is legal. Now, just as in Nevada of this fine country, they have legal but regulated prostitution. Think aboot that. They got rid of the vast majority or crack babies, crack whores, STD passing, and violence of that situation, while maintaining the sex part (hey! i got to say "sex part"!) as well as making it less expensive. Just to let u know aboot the regulation, there are to be no new permits for pot coffee-houses, a store may have no more than 500g of product, and a single person may buy no more than 25g at a time, and may be in possesion of no more than 40g (a CD weighs 150 grams). In Canada, weed has been decriminalized. That does not mean legal. It just means u dont go to jail for it. U lose yer weed, and u get a ticket. They saw that jailing these ppl for simple possesion does more harm than good. They also discovered that ppl are paranoid aboot the police, not from the weed, weird, huh? I could rant aboot this for a while. I choose not to this time.  If the sky is the limit, then what is space? Is that too much to ask for? I think NASA would disagree. Maybe Dubya would, too. Maybe he just wants to get re-elected. Maybe he wants to get shot and then have a legacy. Either way, Congress has cut the funding for Bush's plan to make a base on the moon, then to use it to make a mission to mars. Maybe somebody from NASA told Bush there was oil on the moon. Then congress called the bluff. Did u kow NASA only got 15 million a year. We dont jsut spend more or cocaine we spend multiples more. The federal gov't funded a N. Carolina study once. It cost $15,000. What did they find out? They found out common reasons why prisoners don't liek jail. WTF? WTF? W...T...F....? They could have given me a five to tell them INTER-RACIAL GAY RAPE, BUBBA WANTS TO DANCE WITH ME, THE FOOD SUX, U KENT GET A G.E.D. NEMORE, MUCH LESS COLLEGE, IT IS PUNISHMENT FOR DOING SUMTIN WRONG!!! WHEN I GO BACK, I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO BACK TO WHAT I WAS DOING B4 JUST TO LIVE ,NOT JUST TO MAKE A LIVING!! DUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHH! NOW GIVE ME MY GODDAMN 5$, ASSHOLE. AND QUIT WASTING MY TIME AND MONEY! COCKFACE! 15 mil sounds liek a lot. but u must consider. they are going into outer FUCKING space. Y dunt they stop fighting the drug war and go to mars for the oil. i think they should.   Isn't Disney World just a people trap operated by a mouse? Think about it. Some rich mother fucker thinks he's funny. God thinks he's funny, too, but that is a different rant. I was at Disney World, not terribly long ago. It was a band trip. i dint do ne tripping while i was there, tho. I had some ouzo, tho. It is good. Rich ppl own this country. 98% of the resources are owned be 2% of the populace. They also get taxed the least, on a percentage basis. Think aboot tha for a second. If a rich bastard suddenly lost 25% of his income, does he starve? Fuck no he doesn't. He gets screwed silly by his multiple supermodel GFs while eating deep-fried oreos off of their asses. u should try that some time, it is fun. What if somebody woh makes 12k a year loses 2%? They get eveicted, and eventually lose thier job and die an early death. y? the poverty line is 16k. that means that if u make 12k a year at McD's (and u have to be promoted to manager to make that much, or should I say little, cash), u still dont make enough to live in the most squalid conditions. Welfare pays better. So their comes a question: Is it better to work your ass off, 40 hours a week, then walk home, or is it better to make 16k on welfare not working, then adding thousands of dollars in cocaine money to that in a neighbor hood where the police don't protect or serve, but are only to happy to pin u to the street and yell NIGGER!!, the risks are not great. then after u are done working a few hours a work on the corner, your drive home in yer excalade with 24 inch wheels. It really comes down to how good a person u r. i would not starve working 40 hours when i could thrive selling drugs. not a chance in hell. die or die early? i say die early. how much is being moral worth to you. per year, i mean. think about it. then hink about blacks on welfare. then leave them the fuck alone.    okok, that was alot of angry stuff there. I will lighten it up with some pick-up lines i found.  Do you have any raisins? No? How about a date? Are you a parking ticket? (What?) You got fine written all over you. Hey baby, you've got something on your butt: my eyes. If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put U and I together. If you were a booger I'd pick you first. Baby did you fart, 'cause you blow me away! You know what? Your eyes are the same color as my Porsche. Are you going to kiss me or do I have to lie to my journal? ( I may have to use that with blog in place of journal) Baby, if you were words on a page, you'd be what they call fine print. Excuse me, is that your perfume that you are wearing? (ok, read it agian. got it? good!) Has anyone ever told you that you have Scandinavian hands? (Uh, no.) No, of course not, that would be an incredibly stupid thing to say, wouldn't it? (LOL) I may not be the best looking guy in here, but I'm the best looking one talking to you. Help stop rape--Consent! (ok that's a lil' creepy) If I had a nickel for every time I've seen a woman as beautiful as you, I'd have 5 cents. (that one is good b/c it is true aboot every girl a guys sees, but it sounds good) If you were a laser, you'd be set on "stunning". (that's really kind of sad) Know what I like best about you baby? You haven't maced me yet. Honey, I hate to see you go, but I love watching it. You are like a candy bar: half sweet and half nuts. (i kno women liek that. but then, I also know men liek that) You've been a bad girl. Go to my room.  lovely. see you later
