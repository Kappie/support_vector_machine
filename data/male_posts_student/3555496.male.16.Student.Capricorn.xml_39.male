Our "new" baritone player is also gay. He's semi-new because the bastard switched from trumpet; I mean, who the hell does that? I'll tell you who: our "new" gay baritone.     Yeah the new drum majors (3) really get on my nerves. They let all their new found power go straight to their heads.  They're ordering us around and making everyone run laps and making us stand at attention with our horns up for very long periods of time. I mean, if I was playing the flute or the piccolo I wouldn't complain, but  marching baritones are really fucking heavy . Plus I'm not exactly happy to do that  when the three fatass drum majors need more exercise than I do.     Well, crazyass FFA goat girl and her friend are really pissed at me cus I didn't return any of their calls this summer, but I don't care. They look weird. It's not a huge loss anyway, because.... they look weird.    They started this donation thingy for each section. See, we're supposed to donate money to some dude so he can make the last day of summer band  really cool  and buy food for everyone and stuff, so he tells us the section that gave the most mula would get to eat before everyone. Since both the trombone and the baritone section are small compared to the assload of trumpet, saxophone, clarinet, flute, french horn, and tuba sections, we both joined forces and gave a crapload of cash. Yeah we heard that the saxes gave $19.34, so we were like droppin' cash like nobody's business. We gave a total of  $59.17 , from only 8 people. I myself actually only gave $3, but hey, it's the thought that counts. Yeah so all you saxes out there, watch out. I'll kick your ass.    I think the only good thing about band so far is the color guard. And I mean  good . Yeah the new freshman chix are pretty and hot, not to mention pretty hot. Wow that makes me sound like a pedophile, I'm all like old and stuff. Seriously, I think some of them are quite possibly non-freshman, if it makes me sound less  urlLink pedophileyish .     I actually had fun, on my way to band, during lunch, and on my way home. That's because I was driving!! Yeah all by myself lol. It was pretty damn cool. Shh! Don't tell anybody: I only have my permit... But when October rolls around, I'll be 100% legal, baby.    Well, I can't wait for next week. More band.  More asshole drum majors . More color guards.
