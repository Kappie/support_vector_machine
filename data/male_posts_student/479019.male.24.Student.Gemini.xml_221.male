I bought some warmer clothes, beer, a coffee maker, a new knife, a cutting board, one of those trays/racks for drying dishes, a pillow, and lots of groceries.  It's been getting colder here, but it's not unbearable. I think I'm going to have to slowly build up my collection of warm clothes.  In rotation right the  Transplants  "Tall Cans In The Air." It makes me much more curious about their upcoming album and makes me wish I saw them play with the Distillers. Audioslave's "Cochise" is interesting too. I want to hear more of them too.  ***
