He had clearly suffered from the ravages of acne – there were still some pimples on his once-chubby face, which was now rather thin. His twinkling eyes were framed by grayish-blue glasses and his fringe hung rather heavily over his forehead. Even as he spoke he pushed it up. Dressed in shorts and a bright orange tee, he looked every inch an ordinary Muggle, yet he was also a wizard, by the name of Matthew Chia. 	 “’Morning, Uncle, Aunty,” he said, turning to Cheryl’s parents, who nodded back. “I daresay you’d like to talk to my parents? They’re in the inn,” he said, winking. Mr. and Mrs. Cheah smiled and went off down the street, dragging Cherie with them.  	 “C’mon, let’s go get our books,” Matt said. 	 The street they were walking on was the only magical one in the whole of Singapore. Small shophouses lined it, filled with a dazzling array of wizarding... stuff. Many of the shophouses were made out of marble, giving the street a white shine that was brought out by the golden sunlight. In fact, the whole street was so white it looked as if everything had been scrubbed clean. The cobbled street was packed. Some wizards were wearing Muggle outfits – others had opted for more ambiguous gauzy shawls, scarves, and robes. A large crowd was gathered round  Quality Quidditch Supplies  – the store was, of course, an enterprising Singaporean franchise of the British original. The crowd was oohing and aahing at the Firebolt in the window – broomstick imports always came in rather late.  	 Meanwhile to their right was  My Magical Best Friend , the pet store. Hoots, coos, purrs and various discomforting squeals were emanating from the dim interior. Walking on, Cheryl and Matt passed  Farquhar’s Freaky Factory  – William Farquhar was the first chronicled creator of a joke shop. Soon they came to  Raffles’ Publishers , where they were to buy their books. The place was overflowing with students – Cheryl recognized Wee Minyu, Chng Hu Ping, Chew Yi Fan and Jaslyn Leong, and waved frantically to them. Meanwhile, Matt was speaking to the shop attendant. 	 "...yes, we need two copies of  Jinxes for the Jinxed and Hexes for the Helpless ... yes, two copies... no, I don’t want to copy them, I want  two copies ...” 	 They left the store a few minutes later, moneybags considerably lighter and bags much heavier. The books this year were unusually thick. And expensive. 	 “Hey Cheryl! Matt! CHERYL!” someone was shouting. Cheryl turned round and saw yet another friend, Muthu. He had never revealed his real name to them and had always insisted they call him Muthu, even though he wasn’t Indian in the slightest. He was rather dark though. Cheryl noticed that he was much taller than when she last saw him the previous year. She sighed. Everyone was growing except herself. 	 “I thought you’d already bought all your stuff long ago?” Cheryl asked. 	 “Well, my parents decided to let me stay the night at The Wacky Wizard… you are too, aren’t you? And Matt?” 	 The other two nodded, and they continued ambling down the street, talking about how they had spent the holidays, about their homework (which had been horrendously difficult and tedious) and the coming school term. They went to the apothecary to get their potion ingredients (Cheryl’s supplies of hedgehog quills and moonstone were running low). Very soon it was evening, and the sun was setting on a blood-red horizon. The shophouses in Change Alley were bathed in gold, orange, pink and purple, and the lamps suddenly came to life, giving out soft yellow light.  	 The trio made their way to a small inn near the end of the alley. A sign hanging at its entrance proclaimed it as “The Wacky Wizard Inn – the best in town!” 	 “Well, obviously it’s the best, it’s the  only  one in town,” said Matt dryly. They passed the large bronze statue of a wizard in top hat prancing about and went inside the inn.
