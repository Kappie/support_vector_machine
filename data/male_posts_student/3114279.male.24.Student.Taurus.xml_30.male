      Yo yo yo, you whippersnapper motherfuckers. 60 year old man? Whatever. You'll hit the big 24 soon, and then you'll feel just like I do. Congratulations on quitting and everything. I've only ever quit from one job, service zone, and I didn't really do it in any interesting manner. I wasn't going to post today, since I have two million things to do before I go to work, but a comic book webpage I was trying to read wouldn't work. But now it is working. And I don't have anything interesting to say. Oh, speaking of that gay bar I went to the other night, there were actually a couple of straight girls there (or really goddamned convincing drag queens, but hopefully the former) who were pretty nice and intelligent and flirty. Of course, me and my neuroses didn't actually click with this until I was long gone from the bar, so it didn't matter. They told me if I was a character from friends (which I hate and don't watch and hate) then I would probably be Joey. He's the stupid one, I guess, which I immediately mentioned, so they changed me to Ross, the whiney one. Urgh. I guess I should be happy with any of them, since they can all apparently hook up with Jennifer Anniston. Watch out, Brad Pitt. I'm a-comin for ya. This is the lamest post I've ever done.
