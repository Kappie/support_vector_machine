And when finally dad gives me a chance to set it straight, me like an eternal dumb dumb, which I am, spend my time on the WEB! (Aah well but WEB and Spiderman are related to each other ... :P) Stupid forums spree has got me STRUNG once again. I have already started to develop those wrinkles under my eyes. Havent slept at night properly for about 3 days now, and the thing that made it so easily possible is .. PANADOL EXTRA .. (I luva PANADOL!) !  On another  note, thankyou Talhasupremacy for honouring me in your blog and yeah for appreciating me as SPIDERMAN .. there are very few who understand .. :P .. lool .. !  Oh and yeah .. the new article is out baby ... and is not gonna last long .. only 3 more days .. Feast your eyes and (stupid) brains .. to the article on  urlLink http://www.mecampus.com  in the student news section!  Well now my (DONKEY) computer or mebbe DSL has started itching me once again for staying too long on it .. (coz when i do .. it refuses to upload any web page) Hence my only choice now is to Publish this post .. and sign off  Ma3salaam den
