It wasn't just the 5km jog, nor the 1st lap of the 6km walk that I walked and decided to give up halfway because it just wasn't realistic - I said something that I shouldn't have, but was something that I had realised that could happen.  Well, Ms Wong gave me the scolding I deserved. But being the idiot that can't seem to open or close his mouth at the right time, I just couldn't open my mouth to apologise.  This teacher is no ordinary teacher. She has brought me through four years of Scouting, given me lessons that I will never forget in my life.  But it seems that if there was one lesson she hadn't given me, it was for talking without thinking.  I rarely spoke to give my opinion during meetings last year, but it was probably a good decision - I'd never make good in ANY useful meeting anyway.  How could I have spoken of our batch this way? What right do I have to declare that there is a segregation between President's Scout Award candidates and non-PSA? How could I have even dreamed that the batch would sneer at us?  Am I even suitable to take up this responsibility? Do I even have the right to represent the unit to become a candidate?  How can a guy that has a phobia of swimming even think of landing it as a PSA holder?  I have been too immature, too naive to think that I could ever make it.  It has always been my dream, of course, and I will continue to pursue it - but I pray my mouth -and I - can start growing up for a change.
