When we first met up, it was as if we already knew each other for a hell of a long time.. lolz.. we talked as if we were long lost friends or something.....  I thought I would be very left out in the poly.. because... maybe I wasnt cool enough or something... but it was very different... within the first few hours of my poly life, I have already started making a quite a number of friends... In fact, my class is the only class in the whole school of business and information that is so closely bonded together that we could win almost every single ice-breaker games.... lolz  My closest friends would be Timothy, Jason, Sarah, Sonia, Shi Hui, Sabarina.. lolz..but the rest of the class is still very close to me... lolz..  On the first day of orientation, we were all already quite close to each other, already knowing our interests, our past lives and for many of us, what we used to do during the holidays even... Then the games came.. the icebreaker games were so easy for us as we knew each other's name already... so it was super easy.... Then came the more tougher team games.. which we passed much more easily then the other teams, mainly because they were not very united while we were glued together like a family... lolz  The second day, we had a farni oriention... Fers started with a very long winded dumb speech by a geeky looking old man, then came the different slide presentations *yawnz* But in the afternoon, we had the elections of Mr and Ms SP, at which our class took out most beautiful and handsome couple out.. lolz... We managed to get to the finals because Sabarina said something wrong... lolz.. but our class didnt get the top place.. lolz  On the third day was the President's Charity Flag day, and we were kicked out onto the streets to beg people for money... lolz.. Timonthy and me teamed up and walked around the whole of Tanjong Pagar and Raffles place to ask for donations.... but that was one of the biggest mistakes we made.. lolz.. because we wont get money from walking around the streets, we shuldve stayed at one spot and ask for money.. lolz.. like a traffic light or something... Jason, Sonia and Sarah came up with the most money, finishing all the stickers that they were provided with... Our class came up with a total of 970+ dollars.. which was quite cool, considering our class isnt really very big.. lolz  Lolz.. then today, Jason, Timothy and me went to Jurong Point to buy a present for Becky and Sarah cause their birthdays are coming.... Spent quite some time searching for the right presents... lolz...  This is a class that anybody would dream off.. cooperative, friendly, supportive... yeah.. can tell we're going to have a good year ahead...  Mood: Happy, Cheerful.. Contemplative...
