Her: Is your phone under warranty? Me: I don't know. Her: How old is it? Me: Maybe a year and a half. Her: The warranties are usually only one year.  So we'll say it's not. Me: Can you check? Her: [audible sigh] What's your phone number? Me: [phone number] Her: No, it's 2002.  That's 2 years ago.  It's not under warranty. Me: Okay... Her: If it was under warranty, we could test the battery and see if that's the problem.  Since it's not under warranty, we won't. Me: So how do I know if I need a new battery? Her: I'm not a technician. Me: Okay... so how do I know if I need a new battery? Her: If it was under warranty, we would test it. Me: Okay... Her: Batteries for that phone are $60. Me: That's more than the phone cost. Her: That's what the battery costs. Me: Is it cheaper to get a new phone then? Her: Do you want a battery or a phone? Me: I've had the phone for 2 years I guess.  Is there a point at which I can a rebate on a new one? Her: I'm not a technician. Me: Okay... Her: Let me see if we have any of the batteries in stock.  [she goes away and comes back almost instantly with a battery] Here.  It's $60. Me: Are the batteries cheaper elsewhere? Her: How would I know? Me: Is there any way to know if it's the battery that's the problem, and if I replace the battery it'll hold the charge longer? Her: If it was under warranty we would test the battery. Me: But you won't test the battery now, even though I would buy a new battery. Her: Right. Me: Do you think it's the battery? Her: I'm not a technician. Me: Okay. Her: Do you need anything else? Me: I think I'm going to wait, and see if I can get the battery cheaper elsewhere. Her: Thank you for shopping at Sprint.  Bizarre.
