I have a friend who is one of the most amazing people I know was let down, and now she just wants to give everything up. I don't know what to do to help her because I don't know how. It hurts just talking to her though, because I don't want to see her sad. As many times as I've been dumped, I know how much someone can hurt another person, but I still can't help but hurt for her, and now pains me more than any time when I've been dumped myself. I value my friends and family more than anything I have or will ever own, and when one of them is hurt, I don't care about anything that is going on in my own life, just theirs. As much as I want to, I just can't help her though. Nothing is restricting me except my inability to console her. I don't know what else to write but that if she reads this I want her to know that no matter what happens, I'll always be here for her. Always.
