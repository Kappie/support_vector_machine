I then went to the Appizzle store in order to get my... Okay I'll stop with that... I went to get a mini iPod but it was all SOLD OUT FOR FATHER'S DAY. Do people actually buy their fathers gifts for father's day worth $250? Jesus. So I ordered it and it should arrive in 4 weeks. But I bought iLife 04 which comes with Garageband and I am currently making a song about muslims to be realeased tomorrow. Not today because I just finished it and it's too late for me to record. I also bought a protecting case for my iPod. I got My Baby's Daddy on DVD from Blockbuster which I will watch shortly. Oh, on the way back from Blockbuster a cop pulled my mom and I over for going around a U-Turn too fast or something... And my mom didn't have the registration with her in the car!! :-o  My mom paid a $10,000 fine and is currently in San Quentin.  No... Joking... She is currently at home... The cop let her go because my mom is pretty.  Sooooooooooooooooo... What else? Oh, I totally redecorated my room. Whatever. Um... Hmm... Garageband is cool...  I'll post the Muslim song tomorrow... It's funny... It starts sentimental, then it's blues, then country, then rap and then salsa... Amazing.  I deserve a grammy or at LEAST a fucking (insert valueless item here).  Let me check my agenda for what I'm doing the next couple of days.  Sunday: Sit in front of the computer and do nothing. Eat - Tenative. Pee - Tenative. Drink - Tenative. Sleep - Tenative. Monday: See Sunday Tuesday: See Monday Wednesday: See Tuesday Thursday: See Wednesday Friday: See Thursday Saturday: See Friday  TILL NEXT TIME!! This has been another Sausage Fest Production.
