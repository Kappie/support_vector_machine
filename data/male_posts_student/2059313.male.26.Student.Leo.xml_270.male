When I got there I saw an old friend... and he happens to be the manager of the place.  I haven't seen him in a while, and I don't think he ever knew my last name or anything, so when the reservation came in, he didn't recognize my name.  When I got there he immediately recognized me and my roommate (although he still sees him on a more consistant basis).  He gave me a hard time and stuff like friends do, and then he cut me a really sweet deal.  Instead of driving around in a Geo or another Cavalier, he set me up with a too sweet 2004 Honda Accord... pretty loaded, too.  I tell you, as of right now, driving hasn't been much sweeter.  I even took a drive on I-75 one night just to drive it.  It's been a great time, and I'm not looking forward to Monday anymore (which is when I get my car back, supposedly).    Y'know, actually, if my car is working the way it should when I get it back... I'll love it!   (and for $1500.00, it better!)
