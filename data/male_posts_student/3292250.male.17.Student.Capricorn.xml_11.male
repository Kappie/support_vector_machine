First off it's the name of a song from  La Cage Aux Folles  (a French play, then French movie, then B'way musical;  The Birdcage  was based off it). The best versions of the song are by Linda Eder on the album "Broadway, My Way" and a more Disco-esque hit by Gloria Gaynor. The song has become an anthem of sorts in the gay community, and rightfully so. Secondly, it's kinda-sorta my little theme. It's very singable and very happy and proud. I listen to it and I feel more happy than I was when I started, even if I was in a horrible "fuck the world" mood or a fantabulous "I just got hit on by cute boys" (I wish!) mood.  Today should be fun. I've got Stephie's graduation cookout followed by the musical  Pippin  at 8. Also Mom gets back in about 22 hours, so I need to get the house all cleaned. She's made an offer on this really nice house I hope we get. Then it's time to pack up all of my junk and get ready to leave. it's coming up fast on me. At least we aren't moving the day after school's over like last year.
