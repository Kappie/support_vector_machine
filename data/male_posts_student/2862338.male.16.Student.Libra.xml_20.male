Ok, so yeah, on to some intresting reading about myself to entertain all 5 of you who acutally read this (thnx by the way).  I woke up at 5:30 this morning from another dream.....but this one was one of those crazy intriguing ones.  In the dream, i ask out Claudia to a club, and i end up meeting her at a Blug called "Seven".....ya, i think thats a cool name too, but anway, then there's sabby playing cards in sunglasses saying you have to pay extra if you want to play with sunglasses....i say something along the lines of "what a "rip-off" or something like that.  Well, i start going in, and i go into different rooms, and everytime i go into one, it switches to a overhead shot of the place i'm at, and three chicks, on is on a gurny, and the other 2 are helping her out.  Anyway, if i remember correctly, the first room was a "COlloseum" style room, kinda like an ampitheater.  I explore it for alittle bit, then get out of the room.  I'm like "i wonder where She is" or something like that, then, go into the next room.  This room is kinda like a sand floor, and had some statue or rock crashed into it, but it's still all very calm, then i belive i juss had like, rushes of thought surge through my head (that happens soooooo much). um, then, it goes back to the 3 chicks, cept this time, there having sex, and, it's like awsome.  It goes back to me, opening a door, to the very room there in, and then it goes to one of those weird angles again, then i wake up....i was like "whoa".  Well, ya, i'm pretty sure it went like that, prolly not EXACTLY like it, but close enough....anyway, i once again try to go back to sleep, but to no success...i can;t stop thinking, thats my problem.  I''m not saying i'm smart...thats the LAST thing i am, i'm juss saying that i'm always thinking...i think about everything! before i know i'm going to meet someone, i always think about EVERY senario possible to be prepared, why i'm listening to music, i'm relating lyrics to events in my life, then, at the same time, think  of those moments, and how they made me feel, and how that's been either a good or bad expierince.  I'm porlly not the only one, but if i am...crazy.  I also think all this thinking has hightened my imagination, and mental "imaging"  Like literally, i can close my eyes, and like, recreate everything in my mind, and like, it's as clear as day to me, almost as if i still had my eyes open, it's sooo awsome..once again, i'm sure one of you are gonna IM me or something saying you have the same thing, but i doubt it....i dunno....for some reason, i'm feeling very....religious? I dunno, i juss wonder to myself what i'm on this earth to do.  As i explained in the previous entry, Sylviz Browne cahnge my life, and views on almost everything.   Now, while were on that subject, i think it's safe to explain something about me.....what most of you know is "me", really is me, but there's also the other parts of me, my beliefs, my opinions, my actions that many of you don't see....My views on almost everything is complicated....i know all this is making you say "everyone is like that" but i'm juss saying that, cause i want to let everyone know (if they haven't picked it up) that i'm a seriously DEEP person, even though i don't/hardly show it.  well, ya, now that thats done.....sorry abou tthat...it's like 12:22, and alot of shit happned, lemme tell ya.  School went as usual, first period was cool, we did the whole   urlLink Walkabout  program presentations and everythingm that was pretty cool, i signed up for that thing for the next meeting....i'm not sure if i'm gonna do it yet, but we'll see.  2nd i had off, in which i played "mow mow" or somethign like that....it's this German card game Andy mentally imported from...well, germany.  We played for awhile (most of the period) and i listen to much disco on da I-Pod.  I noticed maylene looking over, like always...and, like always, i never respond back to her.....i feel like shit for not doing anything.  Like, i hate it when you think NO ONE thinks anything of your, or thinks bad of you, but then when you find out they do, and they say it, wait, nevermind, i'm confusing myself, let me start over with an example.  In eigth grade, there was this new girl, Nicole...she was fairly tall, and a good freind of Me, sabby, and apparently Katie and CArly Nalven.  Anyway, i think i was talking to her, about a crush she used to have on me, and i was like "lol, wow, i didn't know that'" and all that eigth grade shit, but then she told me something that totally hit me like a ton-a-bricks.  She says "i was like one of the hardest guys to get with"...and like, it's not because of the fact that she liked me, and coulnd't get me, but because her freinds told her that.  Like, they all said "i was on of the hardest guys to get with in school"  Do u get the felling behind that? it's hard to explain....even ahrder to type, but it's one of those "wow, i never really knew i was considered like that" thing.  Not a bad thing, juss one of those kinda pleasently suprised thing.  well, ya, that.  So ya, might as well explain my History with maylene....if you want to all it that.  In about..i'd say, 5th grade, my older brother, and HEr oldest brothers were best friends.  Anyway, since we went to the same school, once in a while we'd go in the same car, and stuff, but i was the new kid in 5th grade...and very shy, so i always try to ignore her and shit.  Well, that kinda happens alot throughout the year, i remmebr once we dropped her off at The twins' house.  Well, ya, then like, acouple of months down after that, i get a call right when i get outa the shower.  It's a girl, and she's gigling.  She says "Alexa Irish Likes you" and i was like "who the fuck is that?" and i yadda yadda yadda, i hank up.  For as long as i remember, i was trying to look for alexa irish....i had NO idea who this girl was, but i had to see her, it was my mission.  I was the new kid, and to have someone like me was incredible....well, turns out, i've seen her many-a-time, juss didn;t know it was her...but ya, thats the end of that.  fast foward to 9th grade, and i kinda notice her looking at me....the greatest evidence of this is when we where watching a movie...i ended up sliding my desk right up next to her's, and you know, try to wiggle closer and farther away, juss to see what she does...anyway, i get tired, and i put a jacket thing on my head...but i can still see through it, but she apparently didnt know.  I saw here constantly looking down, moving ever-so closer, and biting the lip and/or fingernail...a sign that something is going through her mind....didn't pay it much notice though, i thought i was juss my imagination and wahtever.  Fast foward to NOW, and i contantly see her looking at me.  Now, i know, it could juss be me, but i mean, it's so obvious sometimes! i'm not trying to flatter myself by saying this, it's juss that it's so confusing. well, i barely talk to her, and i think the only good expience we've had is when she came over to talk to me and hernandez.  Well, ya, so thats all about her.  Um, then spanish comes up, and i create more false tention between me and claudia. see, were reading this really good poems this guy wrote...to lazy to link it up, or remmebr his name, but there awsome.  Anyway, everytime he reads one, i think about her....but she always (apparently) thinks about her old b/f Rob, who i know still love each other cause the only reason they broke up (to my knoledge) is cause he went away to collge, and the long distance wasn;t doing them any good.  well, ya, so i was kinda pissed.  I set the conversation up to have it so that i could eventually see her at health smart....it obviously works, and she said she'll be there around 3:30, or apparently before, or ALONG time after, cause i neevr saw her...more on that alittle later..well, ya, nothing happens till earth scince, when alittle peice of info was varified.  See, our littlecircle of freinds has pondered the notion that shawna has no freinds....(well, yuo know, freinds freinds, not juss people you chill with at shcool, and would never talk to the, outside of it), well, it's true, she said it herself,....aside from adam, AND like some other person, there's like no one...yep....juss what i heard...at the end up class, she got all up on my like usualy, giving me false hopes.....ya....nothing else really happnes, then after school comes...OHS mole...O YEAH, THE MOLE....nothing special...i was really tied due to the fact that i woke up abnormaly early. i went down at around 4:32 to go talk to Claudia, but she wasn;t there....i know cause i didn;t see her car, and i didn;t see her inside (she;s usually always doing something where you can see her) so anyway, discouraged, i didn't even bother asking the chick at the counter, who's her friends, if she was, infact, there or not.  On the way bac i felt soooooo burned....see, while i was doing the mole, iwas thinking of EVRYTHING i would do (like i said above),so ya after that, i juss wanted to go to sleep, then kinda did.  after the mole, i had no ride, so mike kindly let me stay over till i got a ride, in which i did, but jones wanted to get a game, so i had to go there too. i end up bieng like 2 hours late, and all we do is watch alittle bit of movies....i go home, fix me clothes, then go on the comp, and start right this shit....my mood pretty much changed through this entite blog...crazy. anyway, like always, i prolly missed alot of shit, and by now, and i'm sure ALOT more sypos..so i'm gonna call it a night....sorry bout the bitching to....but damn, it's good to juss say it ya know?
