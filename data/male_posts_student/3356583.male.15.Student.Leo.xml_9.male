I can't write for teenage girls! That's f**king Robbie Williams. - Noel If anyone don't like oasis they're shit! - Noel Jesus was 5ft 6ins apparently, so i'm bigger than God - Noel  "Liam's leaving the band this very minute. Liam's ALWAYS leaving the band. It's raining today so he's leaving the band 'cos it's raining. (Imitating Liam) Why is it raining? ****! That's it! I've had enough of this, I'm going! I'm sitting there saying (cheerfully) See you then, bye! He threatened to leave in Minneapolis because I wouldn't go to a pub with him!" - Noel on Liam "We are the biggest band in Britain of all time, ever. The funny thing is, that f***ing mouthing off three years ago about how we were gonna be the biggest band in the world, we actually went and done it." - Noel I only know five people who haven't taken drugs and that's my mam, me gran, me father-in-law, me mother-in-law, and my new-born baby. Everyone else I know, be they lawyers, doctors, or what have you, they've all got their heads down once in a while. Nothing wrong with it, all part of growing up. - Noel In Newcastle some geezer jumped up on the stage and punched me in the eye. It went off pretty bad; there was a riot at the gig. You always get that in England. There's always someone in the front giving you the finger. Did they queue up for six hours just to come down and call me a wanker? I don't understand that mentality. It's very strange. - Noel
