Let me explain: It starts out with a slam-bam beginning, straight into action. This makes the Squirrel happy. Then it lapses into a long period without any ass kicking. This makes the Squirrel slightly perturbed, but it wasn't so bad, seeing as you got to see some seriously nifty sets and got a look at how Zion flows. It's a pretty badass place, really. After a half hour or so of gab, Zion-style-rave parties/Eucharist, and schmoozing with the high muckymucks of Zion, Neo and the crew go out to kick some ass, slow-motion style. We now enter what I'd like to call the: HOLY FUCK! portion of the movie. I call it this, because that is mainly what will be on your mind. I can't exactly remember how long this lasted, but I do remember that it lasted a long damn time. Some highlights:  Dude! Vampires! Sweet!  Dude! Really really tight plastic dress thing! Sweet!  Dude! Orgasm-cake! What the hell?! Sweet!  Dude! That car totally hit that other car! Sweet!  Dude! Whoa, that explosion rocked my world! Sweet!  and finally:  YES!!!  I'll let you figure out on your own what section of the movie the YES!!! was for. It should be pretty obvious.  Oh, and about all those people who said Reloaded didn't have as cool a story as the first Matrix? They can go to hell. The Matrix Numero Uno was great because it set up this absolutely amazing world and backstory. Reloaded builds off of that, and adds in this kind of creepy metaphysical, metaphorical, metasweetical aspect to it all. I don't really understand the majority of it... yet . I need to see the movie another 15 times or so, then I can start philosophizing (sic?).   -Dice Squirrel  Post script: there's this part where Neo kicks this guy, and the guy flies through a frickin' glass brick window. That made my week, just right there.  Post post script: when do we actually  get  the aforementioned Orgasm Cake?
