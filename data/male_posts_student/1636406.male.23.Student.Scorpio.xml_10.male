I've decided that I want to make Japanese my major, so that I am able to give it the attention and effort it demands, as well as gaining a skill that will last my whole life.  I really think this had to happen, I just hope that I am able to get in and that I can continue with my studies instead of being out of the loop for a couple years.  Wish me luck!
