All programs that keep comments are down it appears....this leaves me no choice....I must move this page to my own domain very soon and switch over to greymatter....for a lazy bum like me this is no good at all....  I had a nice long convo with  urlLink Kelly  yesterday....she is cooler than she knows....I need to meet a Kelly out here....(1)knowledge of self and (2)the ability to have opinions, hold them up against debate, and respect others opinions no matter how different they are from yours are probably two of the 10 most important things I think I'm looking for in the future Mrs. THE Killa Cal....  Oh yeah I have modified my nickname....I am now THE Killa Cal....like The Ohio State University....I don't know why?....I just am.....  Speaking of I Am....this man Nas has occupied alot of my hip hop discourse lately and I want to put it all on the table....I am a huge fan of Illmatic....if that red CD is in my sightlines 9 times out of 10 it will be placed in the nearest available cd player....I bought It Was Written on it's release date....it was okay to me but I was somewhat disappointed....as an avid sports fan I'm familiar with the typical sophomore slump so I chalked it up to that....the impending release of I Am also happened to coincide with my discovery of cuteFTP as a method of getting MP3's....needless to say I was one of those that participated in the massive downloading of pre-release tracks and (according to my theory) the subsequent altering forever of Nas's musical career and direction....the tracks from that pre-release version of I Am included Poppa Was A Player, Among Kings, Fetus Belly Button Windon, Blaze a 50, Drunk By Myself, Wanna Play Rough, Undying Love, along with a few of the cuts that saw the light of day (Dr. Knockboots, Nas is Like, and Hate Me Now among others).....the point is that if left unaltered I wouldn't even have to dispute whether Nas was a great rap artist as a whole....those songs are still available...download them and you will seee that if he had left it intact it would have been a five-mic album....instead he altered the album and released the decidedly mediocre version that is still is stores today....then he released Nastradamus which clearly he had put minimal effort into....and now it appears that Stillmatic may have some of these formerly unreleased tracks on it and may prove to be a good album....I admit that I am going to purchase it today (yes the real version....I have my ways!....envy me!)....but the fact remains that when the fans got anxious he got bluffed and went commercial....meanwhile look at how Jigga handled it....the first time (Vol. 3) he pushed it back a second but released his album unaltered....then the same thing happens to the Blueprint and he (and this is KEY) pushes the album UP....he never compromised the integrity of the album....now is Jigga a better lyricist than Nas?....no....is he a better marketer?....yes....Is he a better performer?....I don't know, I've never seen Nas perform....I know that I can depend on Jigga to come out with a banger every time out....can't say the same for the former Nasty Nas.....  I respect the Nas from Live at the Bar-B-Que....but Nas circa 2001 has alot to prove to me....this album needs to be free of the Bravehearts....free of mention of the Firm (another album I bought on the strength and was firmly disappointed with)....it needs to get back to what worked best for him....intricate lyrics and vivid images....get your pops, Olu Dara, on here to supply somemore background horns!  Anyway that's how I feel about it right now....any comments can be directed to me either via  urlLink AIM  or e-mail at Killacal13@aol.com since the comments are down....  I'll be back with a review of Stillmatic....and I'll end this whole debate once and for all....
