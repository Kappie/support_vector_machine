AWKARD!... with a capital A.... yeah... i dont mind... but hes a huge stoner.. and its funny.. i think his parents have no idea... haha... but whatever... that was ok because clay and i only stayed for 15-16ish minutes.. then we went to eddies and played poker/ultimate frisbee... fun night... except... A.elly's thong... (GAG!)... B. it was a little awkward with justin and jt hitting on cally more than i do... im just not like that but i didn't know what to do... yeah... im still confused about that... um.. the rest was fun... i totally sucked at poker... like blew HORRIBLY... i only won one round... yeah.. but it was really fun.. then i took cally home and we sat around the campfire with ashley buchanan... that was great too... ashley is actually a pretty cool person... im glad she doesn't hate me... haha.. long story... but thats about it for last night... im going to go to brunch with the guciks now... talk to you later...  -Nate :)
