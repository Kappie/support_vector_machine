Think i could be excused for saturday...had a soccer match in the morning, then lugged my bloody tired legs backtoschool inhiiigh hopesof getting the testimonialfrom mdmpeng but well,she seemed to be busying herself with all the charity stuff and celebrating bo yea's bday and all and well...i really couldnt bring myself to remind her about the reasonwhy i appeared in schoolnot really to help out for harmonica but really to take the testimonial..oh well...life'sshit.   Hauled my tired ass home, bathed, atelunch and then rushedforviolin class that stretched from 3.30 all the wayto 5.15 pm. Totally screwed up on my first accompaniment session, despite ahaving grade 5 experience, i still go nervous on the fingers, which ofcourse,costsme heavily on intonation...i definitely made Dvoral turn in his grave when i totally screwed up on the octave double stops not once but  TWICE!  By the time i got home after passing jiahui the suzuki cd's, i was dead beat and fell dead on my bed until 10pm.  And on sunday, well, i seriously relaxed the whole day...got up at 11am..had a lazy brunch...read the papers...then went to practice on the violin for about 2 hours then played warcraft till about 3.30? Changed and went to meet jiancong at clementi mrt but surprise surprise, sarah and yewon were late in getting to clementi...their reason being a very indecisive linsing who didnt wanna go out at the last minute, haha no worries there.... :)  Went down to bugis first to see Mr Teng perform with a couple of well, middle aged NUS students...and er, i was seriously tickled by Mr Teng's very,very obviouspot belly  but hey, atleast it doesn't spill overhis belt like some FS teacher that i know.......LOL. Oh yea, rushed down to the botanic gardens to watchthe band fiesta like wedo every year...goodness, idont know of any otherbatch of harmonica peoplewho have supported the band so fervently like we have....but hey, i dont know about the rest but i have always been a fan of band music,especially that godly saxaphone that never fails to get me inda groove baby...  Was amusing to see leslie, sanjay and rizal dancing away...no offense rizal, but uwere entertainingnot in the senseof your dancing skills but rathererm, your  valiant  attempts in  TRYING  to dance, wahahaha hey practice makes perfect yea?  Had dinner at Clementi...then went home....showered...and was absolutely delighted atthe sight of three beautiful tubes of Rowntree fruitgums!!Huge thanks to Ahyi for that favour!! And after that,was lights out.  And FINALLY, today, monday, i being the fool, thought class started at 9a, when it was actually a workshop..and for ONCE, i could not enter 154! And it was a bloody double decker bus! Luckily a guy told me that there was another oneright behind...andsarah smsedher sympathy...lol  Think i finally got the hang of the binary thing..and now its worsewith the hexadecimal thingy? And now i am expectedto use SHORTCUTS in the conversion...man....i hate all kinds of math, or arithematic or whatsoever.  IMMF, well, fell asleep as usual..missed out onsomeof the important CSS stuff...i should really kill myselffor that..now i have to go to MEL tosee the powerpoint thing. Practical went better,and its really amusing to see Mr Vic Liang trying to swear silently? But well,hisaussie accent really does make it quite, quite audible...yea. Amusing indeed.  Restof the day is pretty much the same, send zaki home, go home, eat, play, review work, talk on msn, yeaand now blogging...wowee think this is my longest blog yet...wahahaha yea guess thats all then,and oh man, tomorrow'sI.S day...IAC and WAA, here we come...oh well, later people.
