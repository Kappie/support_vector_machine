We went to King's Island on June 8th...or somewhere around there... as a 'reward' type deal for playing for the basketball and football games (once again, yes i am a band geek, but look! a benefit to the whole thing).  We also got free pizza and drinks at each of the games, and we got in for free, so it wasn't too bad.  Unlike the summer jazz thing, i'll be doing this next year.  Last weekend i went kayaking down the fearsome White River with my dad, stepmom, and brother.  That was a lot of fun.  It was kinda shallow in spots so we had to get out and push my dad's canoe sometimes.  It was my first time in a kayak.  They're great (more floaty) compared to canoes.  I almost flipped mine once when i went sideways rather quickly over a rock.  If anyone i know reads this and wants to go, we should plan a trip.  If no one reads this on the other hand, we probably won't go cause i'll forget to ask you.  I don't remember how much it was, but i think it was worth it.  We (my friends and i) had a couple parties, one of which was at my house on the Fourth of July.  Had a lot of fun.  Good times.  Parties are great when people get along and nobody really hates anyone else there.  I don't remember being at one of these kinda parties, but i heard they're no fun.  Well there you go, the good side, not much, but it was good.  I should do more of these good things to make my summer good..-er.
