Enjoyed my day goin' to Tampines laughing at Sugababes' Three album at Sembawang + going on a shopping spree there with food to "ta b'ao" back from there. =P  I've no idea what kind of show Gundam Seed is but the music's darn good! No wonder T.M.Revolution really deserves such credit for producing the anime theme songs for science fiction genre anime series. Perhaps I should start scouting for the Ending Theme of Fruits Basket 'cause it's damm great too~~! =)  *Sigh* I have not written a fanfiction.net installment for a week already. ホームウォークはもっとむずいよ。これはおかしくなかったそしています！いまきいている歌は玉置奈実さんの「Ｒｅａｌｉｚｅ」でございますね。Ｎｅｖｅｒｍｉｎｄですが、ホームウォーク絶対完了しますから！「“準備完了”この字がすきですよ！＝）」そして、いまラティんその語を学び、ホームウォークもつきますながらよ！物語の分をまだ書き無い、書くときが絶対探しますけど。ホームウォークをまだまだ書き無い、しかし事にするときは必ず探しします！じゃ…日本語がへただよ！そして、いまはつづく！＝Ｐ  Phew...kinda' tiring. I should read more Japanese linguistics during my free time rather than to do other rubbish. But in the case of learning Latin, I suppose it shouldn't take up too much time. =) Hmmm...seems like my project work's ain't going anywhere these days too. Much conflict, combined with some who can't find time to meet, is gonna' destroy the group I suppose, with me of course ousted the first. And some class members seem to have a vendetta against me, with an objective to 'sue' me or something like that. Looks like the classroom scene is gettin' too political too with people definitely developing wondrous biases against each other by this time. ((Wah...I'm sounding like some person in the National Convention during the French Revolution radical phase. But if I were a politician, the best place for me would be in the moderate royalists 'cause I'm always advocating constitutional monarchy for the best government!) I wonder if schools in Singapore should adopt the American style of constitution. Judging from yesterday's Simpsons, I suppose the student council in almost every school there will have to write a Constitution before they can do anything about their role in school. =P  Okay, I'm becoming a saliva centre for anyone who is saliva-less~! Got ta' go, see ya! 待ったあしたか二つ日あとで…さようなら！
