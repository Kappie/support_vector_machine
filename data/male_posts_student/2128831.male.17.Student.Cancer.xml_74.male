So what if gays and lesbians want to get married, it's the 21st century get over it. I love how our politicians and religious leaders defend the sanctity of marriage and what it means for the development of a child. I'm the product of divorced parents, how was I raised with family values and what example did it set for me? With a divorce rate of over 50% in this country family values is such a farse. There has never been a family like "Leave it to Beaver" in this country, and if so it was just as dysfunctional as any other. I have several gay and lesbian couples as friends and seeing them getting married doesn't phase me in the least. I think Jared and Bry are very cute together and they are a great couple.  I am going to their wedding in August.  I also deserve to walk down an aisle.  If I wanted to adopt a child it shouldn't bother anyone one bit. Hey, it's better than the child growing up on foster care and feeling unloved, unwanted, and unimportant. People think that if gays and lesbians get married the social structure of the nation will crumble, this is such crap. The bottom line is that the United States is still just as rigid and narrow minded as it has been since the early days of civil rights. This is simply another group of people being discriminated because they are different. This time it's not based off of skin color, but sexual orientation. It's the same old dance just different music, and it's ridiculous. Civil unions should be allowable and recognized. Many businesses in the nation acknowledge alternative relationships and benefits are actually afforded to partners. Harvard is very proactive on this topic.  It's sad that in nation where we consider ourselves a nation of personal freedoms and liberties that it is simply a facade. And to hear President Bush want to change the Constitution regarding this matter is truly disturbing. With his board of anti-American cronies our country has changed drastically in four years. Watch out, you’re next!     Difference Between Focus on Problems, and Focus on Solutions !!   When NASA began the launch of astronauts into space, they found out that the pens wouldn't work at zero gravity (Ink won't flow down to the writing surface). In order to solve this problem, they hired Andersen Consulting (Accenture today). It took them one decade and $12 million. They developed a pen that worked at zero gravity, upside down, underwater, in practically any surface including crystal and in a temperature range from below freezing to over 300 degrees C.     Any guesses on what U.S’s archrivals used?? What did Russians do?  The Russians used a Pencil!!!    Didn't have a good day but didn't have a bad one either. As I was thinking about this blog, I find myself falling into the "poor me" episodes we all have. Yeah, I have bad days but honestly, I am very content with my life. It is rather uncomplicated. I found Mr. Right, well I can't think of a better way to live.  -I clean the house that I messed up when I want. -I cook (badly) and throw away the carton - no dishes. -I hog the covers. -I don't shower on the weekends if I don't want to (however, I don't leave the house that day either). -I usually agree with everything I say. -I never irritate myself (almost never). -It's not as offensive when I look in the mirror and say "you need to loose a little weight." -I don't have a disapproving mother-in-law.   I went a Math Competition and did okays…  Not great but when I went home Big Mama had a Subway sandwich for me!  I was happy!  Lol, Daddy is off to South Dakota, so me and Mama are off to the video store!  Wohoo!  Scary Flick Night wit’ my Chick, lol!  And tomorrow I will be in LaCrosse for this Creative Writing Festival and like I had to print out 13 copies of 5 pages, double-spaced.  I am thinking I have killed a tree for this 65 pages in one day?  Count it, one, two, three, four... And then the registration paper and name- tags and such!  DAMN WE ARE WASTEFUL!  That is like a crap load of trees!  Seriously!  Mauston alone is like 500 sheets!  Grarrrg!  Makes you think you know! So, I tried to write a song…  Lol, my bad attempt but you know it’s for Fabi, and I could be the worst person at writing and he would appreciate my work.  Lol, it isn’t bad though… I think it is okay…  Well, hearts and bright stars to Riley!     Don’t be afraid, this won’t hurt Have some faith this is real Together all these feelings we can sort We together can feel If you just believe in me If you can ever wish to understand If you wish to stay And, let your own thoughts run free If you believe in me… Take my hand Walk together with me Take my hand Let me guide you to a special land Take my hand Don’t let it slip away like grains of sand Just take my hand  Don’t worry at all, this is fine Have some passion, this is real Together we will never draw the line We together can feel If you just believe in me If you ever wish to understand If you ever wish to stay And, let your own thoughts run free If you believe in me… Take my hand Walk together with me Take my hand Let me guide you to a special land Take my hand Don’t let it slip away like grains of sand Just take my hand  And believe in what is there In you… In me…
