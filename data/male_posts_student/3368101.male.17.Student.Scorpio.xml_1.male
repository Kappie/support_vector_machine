Marco - hmmmm - is he gay? or does he just act it?  The man who came in wearing nothing but a G-String should be voted off purely because he's a fucking knob, and an attention seeking loser - wearin a G-String - if that wasn't an attention seeking stunt then nothing is.  Victor - top guy - straight up, no nonsense kind of guy, and isn't afraid to tell his views. Hopefully he'll stay in the house for a fair while.  Ahmed - what can I say but the man is a genius. He fled from war in Somalia, came here as an Asylum seeker, and now has a degree in law and business. Plus, he aint scared to say hes a homophobe. Hopefully he'll make his feelings clear in the house to the gy ones, and all hell will erupt, Victor will back him up.  The Clever Guy - You know, the one who has 4 A levels at grade A, hope he stays in.  There arent any special girls in the house this year, theres a Page 3 wannabe, slut, get her off!   This series will be all about getting as much sex and TV as possible - the C4 bosses think it will get them viewers which it won't. Thick bastards.  I don't like Devina, shes on every bastards TV show there is.  Ah, from now on, my blog will be no-swearing zone.  Currently Listening 2: Michael Jackson - Will You Be There
