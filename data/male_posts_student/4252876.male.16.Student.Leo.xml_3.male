Being the first time a sitting president has deigned to visit our little corner of the country since Gerald Ford in '75, it was a big deal. Turnout somewhere around 10-12,000. I was unfortunately unable to attend, due to the event selling out several days in advance, but I caught some of it on the local news.  urlLink News  and  urlLink transcript . Bush emphasized the economy, and amazingly enough, he delivered  today , at least for us. That's right, George W Bush has helped my family! Not through tax cuts, but because my dad was paid overtime for clearing the streets and making sure the protesters didn't get out of hand. Dubyah also noted the effectiveness of his prescription drug plan (the one whose cost he wouldn't tell us?). On marriage, he reaffirmed his position that "We ought to be encouraging marriage in America." Really George? No shit. Maybe you should talk to some activist judges from Massachussetts about that. More on health care, "We'll expand research to seek new cures for terrible diseases." Sure. As long as they don't involve stem cells. Bad stem cells!  And "You can't be pro-doctor and pro-patient and pro-plaintiff attorney at the same time. You have to choose. My opponent made his choice, and he put him on the ticket. " Kudos, Mr. President. Remarkably witty. On the economic difficulties, "We've overcome these obstacles because of the hard work of America's entrepreneurs and farmers and ranchers and small business owners and workers...We want our farmers not only feeding Americans, but we want them feeding hungry mouths all across the globe. Farm income is up, and one of the reasons it's up, is because of exports of agricultural products are on the rise, and I intend to keep it that way." Maybe farm income is up because you paid them 80 billion dollars in subisidies! But nevermind that. Overall, we gotta give him some credit. He got the crowd going, he said dignity instead of dignitude, and finally got that line about loving our neighbors as we'd like to love ourselves right. Bush also gave us a new weird phrase, "rallying the armies of compassion". Yeah, you do that then.  So I guess that about covers that. Found this  urlLink poem  recently though, quite creative.
