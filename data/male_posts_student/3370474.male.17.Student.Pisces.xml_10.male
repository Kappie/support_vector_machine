My soul was taken from me along time ago, I cannot even remember when it was.  My heart is lost, confused, broken and shattered.  I am so alone.  When all this had began, I hoped I was the only one feeling this pain, for it is unbelievable and unreal that someone can feel all this hurt inside.  I’ve wanted to find something I’ve wanted all my life, true love, someone that cared for me.  She came too late.  I am feeling hallow.  Often my wrists have bled there crimson tears, but never did anybody notice.  My wounds cried so many times.  Screaming for someone to heal them, my heart constantly trying to keep me breathing, but without the willingness, I cannot grant it that one wish.  The emptiness of my life, a void that has yet to be filled.  I’m paranoid.  I’m uptight.  I feel like everyone is always watching me, staring at me, waiting for me to do something wrong.  Now that I have you're full attention, you are going to hear me out, like it or not.  I hate everyone that breath's except for a chosen few.  I hate everything about this world, from the smallest bug to the biggest tree, I hate it all.  I often wonder why I hear voices, why I never put my pain on display, or ever set it free.  Instead of letting my pain, my anguish free, I let it form deep within me, let it become me.  I am my pain, and my pain is me.  It never goes away, they never leave.  Haunting me for age's it seems.  I have tried to cut them out, tried to cry them out.  I opened my sounds, bleed them out.  Nothing worked, the only way to calm them was to take pills, to feed the urges.  I am so confused; I don’t know what’s worth fighting for.  Why do I scream? Why do I breath?  I finally found a cure.  Death.  Felo-De-Se.  The act of self annihilation.  I often say things that I don’t mean, but at the same time, I mean them.  Tonight I am taking my own life, painting my pain on my walls.  Blood is the letters, crimson regret is my clarity.  I have fallen into a hopeless black void.  I cannot stop my fall; tonight I shall meet the devils advocate.  I cant trust anybody.  All truth slips through the cracks in the ground, and the lies, being bigger than the truth, and in stronger numbers, is all the stays in my lost mind.  I will no longer waste myself on you.  Who is you? You is whoever is reading this, you are hardly worth my time or breath.  If you are Jill, I love you and you are worth it.  If you are anybody else, I care not about what you think of me.  Nobody listens to me.  I told you everything there is to know about me.  All my fears that I kept well hidden, all my pain and stress I kept as a goal in life, to overcome it.  As you can see, I have also failed that.  I gave you so many warnings.  But you were not listening.  I spoke so clearly to all of you, and at one point even told you my exact feelings.  You weren’t listening.  This is my session of peace of mind.  Keeping everything silent, no more voices, no more screams, no more anger, no more hate, no more hopeless dreams, no more denial.  Everything I ever did was nothing more but another mistake to you.  I tried to make everyone happy by being what he or she wanted me to be.  It overtook my soul, and I became so afraid to be myself, that I pretended to be who I was not.  Every step that I take is too much.  To much stress that has conversed upon my black heart.  I’m tired of being what you want me to be.  Its so funny how I found myself in tears day after day, wondering why I was cursed to live in this hapless world.  Why was I created? What was my purpose? Was it just to feel all this pain in my heart? I was a waste of life, a waste of air, a waste of food, of everything.  The blood is running trough my veins still, keeping me alive long enough to write this.  To express all my hurt and anger into this one letter to the world.  Ever since that first day where I gave myself paper cuts and showed everybody, someone should have known or taken a clue from that.  I had to feed the pressure in myself.  Its under my skin, tearing at me, slowly killing me.  I fed it by giving it what it wanted, crimson regret.  I keep looking over my shoulder, thinking someone is taking to me, but all it is is a new voice inside the back of my head.  So many voices I hear now.  Anger, Hate, Love, Hope, Death, God, Satan, Angels, Demons.  It’s a whirlwind inside of my head.  You people make me sick.  All these words are ignorant.  Every time you talk to me, I take one step closer to the edge of life, treating every time to jump and die.  I want you all to shut up about life.  Shut up and quit you're bitching about the world.  You don’t know how it feel's like to be like this.  Being on the edge all you're life, and finally getting to the end of you're rope keeping you safe.  Burning it to finally fall.  No matter how hard I tried, I will never see another day.  I am not sorry for what I have done.  So much trouble in my mind, I could care less about how you think of me now.     More about myself, there is a lot to say, I cannot seem to express all my feelings, all my thoughts.    I once sought to find a meaning for my existence.  I often confused what was real, thinking things that I dreamed were real, and it ends up they were not.  There is something deep inside of me that grows and grows.  I’m finally ready to unleash it.  Let the world feel my pain.  I’m falling lower and lower and confusing everything.  My walls are closing in, I can barely breath, and I feel the shadow's dept also closing in on me.    I stare up at the neo sky some nights, thinking how it would be life to finally be in that final resting place.  How it would be to go outside of this earth, and beyond.  What is beyond? Nobody knows.  But maybe, just maybe, its better than here.  I’m always wondering why to everything, instead of asking myself how?  Soon I’m going to run away from everything, and never again wonder why.  Open up my eyes to death, then close them once I take my last breath.      I don’t know what to do.  I’m so confused and lost.  I’m crying everyday.  I’m so alone.  I’m stuck on the outside.  I once felt the hate rise up from the pit of myself.  Eventually, I will be but a distant memory.  Remembered by none.  I tried so hard to make it, but everyone was always mocking me.  You would not recognize me anymore, with my true self being revealed to the world.  You never knew me.  None of you ever knew me.    I’ve always wanted to live underground.  Its strange, and I cannot explain this urge, but it would free me of my pain.  Keeping it underground, stuck beneath the earth, and by force, over take the evil energies around me and turn them into positive.  Would never feel the heat of the sun upon my pale flesh, never have to worry about daylight or darkness, just my own hallow cave.  Hiding away from the world, keeping myself hidden from everything so that no one would know I exist.  I could hurt nobody that way now could I? That’s one of the only things I’m good at now, hurting people.  I tried to let all my pain go, let it leave me and put all my trust and love into somebody.  Too many times I was hurt, too many times my trust was turned into pain and it became forged into the very core of my soul.  And now I feel like I have to run away, escape it all.  I don’t know what I will be searching for, but I know if I try hard enough, I will find it.  The moment I feel it close to me, the moment I can touch it, I will know I found it.  Ill crawl my way to it if I must.  I’m calmer than a heartbeat that is on a flat line; I fear not death or any of its ways.  I embrace the kiss of death every night, I pray I die and that death's depth will come and will me away.  There is barely any more joy's in life for me.  But I found one, sleep.  When I sleep, I feel like, I’m dead, even though it lasts but a few minutes, I seem to be in peace.  I dream so many wonderful things.  Love and happiness find there way into my mind, and I dream them.  It is amazing how happy I am when I dream, its like, I’m in another world, another dimension.  Still, when I wake up, I am forced back to reality and see that I am forced to live another day in this horrible world.  Sleep is the closest thing to death without actually meeting death.
