I wonder if this can relate to our Spiritual Heavenly Father too haha. So today for Father's Day instead of headin' out for dinner like our usual family tradition my dad did what he likes to do the most on any day of the week: cook=P. Yeah up until now culinary arts is still one of my dad's favourite hobbies....besides R/C cars, Model Kits and cars of all sorts *I like that too now ^_^* he is also one of the best cooks in the world. I wish I had talent like him...so far my culinary advancements have taken me only as far as pizza pockets, Mac N' Cheese and eggs =P. OH YEAH and hotdogs and hamburgers...actually to think about it I've made everything that a McD's employee can back in grade 4 when my dad owned a fast food joint in Brampton. OK so maybe I can cook some things =P...I wanna learn good stuff though haha.  So today started off with me getting up at 830am for church. Got ready in 15 minutes and then headed out the door. Dad was making a list of food for this Saturday's church BBQ at London Life place down on Oxford. So we left, I read over the list *various types of Pah's, salads, kabobs, etc.* and I'm gonna help prepare the food again haha. The memories of last year when me and Gavin made the food....mixing the chicken, butchering the chicken, pretending I was a one of those "Siu Laap Po" people with a cleaver butchering the meat....I felt like a butcher =P. Obvious why. And so that's what I'll be doing for most of Friday evening...anyone wanna help make food =P?  So picked up Jason, and then off to church we went.  This morning Dave Butler did the Praise portion of our worship since apparently no one did it this week *shrug.* The message today was about honouring our Father's in society and of course of Heavenly Father. Pastor D also talked about the love that we should have in our Heavenly Father, and the faith that there is in Love. So he spoke of the 2nd miracle in John chapter 4 where Jesus heals the Official's Son. The Official begged for Jesus' help, and even had the faith to leave when Jesus said "Go, your son is healed." I mean it's pretty difficult to trust a random stranger to go home and believe in the theory of your child being healed by those words. I like that story also for its message of how Jesus doesn't just do good to those who are Christian, but even for Non-Christians. Afterwards the Official and his family did turn to Christ though, which is still cool. Yeah. And so after service...we all headed downstairs yet again like any other average Sunday =P.  One thing unique today though....FIRST HYPE NEWSLETTER! Rebecca's efforts paid off, and today marks isssue 1 of "What's the HYPE?" It's actually pretty cool I find, with little stories and stuff from people all over HYPE. Josh also put an advertisement for tenmore.net in =P. It's our new domain name which my blog will be moving to soon. Ahh...someplace where I can upload pics and stuff to make my drab layout that much better =P. Back on track though, so we had some refreshments, with stale cheesies being one of them. After some chattin' and stuff, we then headed to Bible Study.  Today we spoke of Daniel once again. Chapter two this time though. The story of him interpreting Nebuchadnezzar's dream. I think I spelled that right. Heard the story many times in my life, but it's still a good one. It's the one about the statue made of gold, silver, bronze, iron and clay; and then a boulder toppling it afterewards and establishing a mountain there. It was a metaphor of the kingdoms each getting weaker and weaker, and eventually the boulder, which represents God will establish the eternal kingdom as He is the ruler of all. Read about it in the Bible =P.  After church we chatted for a bit once again, Jason left with Rebecky and Josh for Dim Sum and I headed home.  Home...watched TV, and then slept ehehehe. Entertainin' no =P. WB Superstar's final episode I finally caught, and wow it sucks. Then dad came, watched some soccer, and the last bit of Superstar, then he went to start preparin' the BBQ and I went to sleep. PS2 wasn't exactly at the top of my list today, and instead I decided to nap and catch up on the missed sleep fron yesterday's staying up watching SNL and MSNing. And also watching Ghostbusters, which is an awesome movie =P. So anyways to my nap.  *Nap nap...3 hours later*  Waking up at 7pm, I go downstairs to a dinner of steak *mmm* and some chinese cucumber with meat dish *shrug.* Ate mostly steak and then some cucumbers haha, and then just sat around downstairs for a bit playing NBA Street Vol.2 for a bit. Me and Jason switched games for a bit, well for me gameS since I got NBA and NFL Street over here now haha. Meh he's beaten both games 3 times over at least anyways, and I haven't beaten NFSU once even sadly haha. Patrick then called for some ball at the park, so picked up my basketball and headed down to the park with him then.  My shot's finally kinda coming back! Somewhat demented still, but at least it goes TO the net now instead of the ground =P. Er...to the net before the ground. Anyways yeah so my shot's finally coming back slowly, and I need to work on driving again. Last summer I could at least make a layup on a fast break or even through traffic, and at  the moment I can't. So yeah work on that. Balled for about an hour, then came back to my place after some chatting outside about old times when Paul used to be around also. Go-Kart building that failed, the long train with escape hatch, gigantic slingshot, soybean milk launching water guns, yeah lots of old memories hahaha.  Anyways yeah so been on blogger since 10:30, still chattin' on MSN...and I may sleep early tonight haha.  Self Reminders: -Report card on 24th -Wednesday bowlin' with HYPE people -Ball at UCC more -Wish Jenn a happy b-day on July 2nd -Stop procrastinating devos everyday -Find a CD by Chicago....recently got into more Jazz-style music  Well I'm out. Later.
