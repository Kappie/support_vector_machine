I've talked to some fellow students about the trip, and they were all full of jubilance when they were reporting back to me. Hopefully I'll feel the same when I return. I'll be sure to give all the details upon my return. I've been so busy lately with school work and my own personal endeavors...I hope to have more time to blog soon! LOL
