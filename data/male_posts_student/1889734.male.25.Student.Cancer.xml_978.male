It's difficult to follow the comment threads as they drift downward to the bottom of the Blog.  And I'm really pleased with some of Danny's answers, because I think we're getting closer to that root I've been seeking.  Addressing Danny directly, let me say a few things.  I'm not here to set you up, or try to trap you in a logic puzzle.  I'm not seeking out inconsistencies as a means to annihilate your entire platform.  I'm not here to 'defeat' you.    I really want to understand the core of your beliefs, and I appreciate the fact that you have came out and said, on one thread, that you weren't sure of the answer.  I'm not always sure either, but I think exploring these uncertainties serves a few valuable functions.  Notably, beliefs should be challenged, because it either exposes a flaw or strengthens them through a rational, well thought out defense.  I don't really care which way we go here, as both are worthy pursuits.  So I want to keep prodding your replies, as well as my own, in an attempt to find the cracks and see how that changes our views on issues.  So keep that in mind as we go back and forth, at least with me.    Why am I so interested?  The answer might surprise you.    As late as 1990, I was just like you.  I was a rabid leftist.  I hated Reagan.  I remember being so depressed when Dukakis lost.  Kennedy was a great man.  I thought Ollie North should burn in hell (although I never could articulate why).  I was way out there on the left, and couldn't ever imagine how someone could be so twisted as to believe in the conservative movement.  So I see some of myself in your positions, and I'm really curious about your internal logic and consistency.  Sometime we can talk about my own transition to where I am now, but I'd rather kick some of these things around and see where they go.  And again, please don't feel like it's a trap.  If you change your mind on an earlier statement, that's fine!  It's the point of the exercise.  I really want this to be a positive conversation - no one 'wins', we're just talking.  That being said, there are a couple of things I'd like to lay out for more conversation.   Well, I'm really not the best to explain this. I'm not entirely sure what all the president is supposed to do to encourage job growth. However, Bush has given tax breaks to companies that export jobs out of the United States. Kerry has stated that, if elected, he'd overturn these tax breaks and start offering tax incentives to companies that keep more of their labor force in the U.S.A. What does this mean? Bush is discouraging domestic job growth while Kerry is suggesting that we encourage domestic job growth. As a freshman in college, I'd be happy to know that the man running our country was working to increase my chances for employment, rather than the alternative.   A wise person recently pointed out that the only real flaw in capitalism is the illiquid nature of labor.  Capital and money can flow where they are needed almost overnight, while labor, in the form of human lives, requires a bit more effort to deploy and change as the economy alters.  I acknowledge this as a limitation, but I see it as more of a problem in culture than a problem in application.  We are slow to let go of industry that no longer offers a competitive advantage to our economy, and this slowness is a result of the inconvenience to the workers displaced.  Speaking from the perspective of a healthy macro economy, I agree that we should not attempt to hold on to jobs that can be done elsewhere for cheaper.  If a good or service can be obtained for a cheaper price, lowering the cost and making said good or service more widely available due to this lower price, then this is a good thing.  And while you can take that to an immediate extreme and say that no one has a job so no one can afford the product, the economy rarely works in that way.  As an example, at one time we made almost all of the steel in the world.  We had the skills and labor to do so at a rate that couldn't be beat by other nations.  That isn't true anymore, but we have replaced those types of jobs with higher technology applications.  It's bad for the steel worker, sure.  But all labor must face the possibility, the reality, that new skills must be acquired.  While it isn't always reasonable to expect a 30 year steel worker to morph into a clean room worker in a medical device plant, the inconvenience does not alter the reality of economics.  It isn't always possible to hang on to industries that are no longer an advantage in terms of labor and cost.  In the big picture, we are healthier for moving from older technologies to new industry.  How many telephone operators are employed in the US?  Typists?  As a nation, we are better off in the long run.  The recent pain of these transitions is more of a function of the pace of technology.  In the past, it took us a whole working career to transition from agriculture to manufacturing.  Most people could squeeze out their working lives in their job, and the younger force coming up would take on the new industry.  Manufacturing to Information Technology was a much faster transition, catching a lot of people in the middle of their career.  Now these transitions are coming in the span of a few years, displacing people at a faster rate.  The required adaptation of labor is harsher now, and we must all be ready to change lives two or three times in our working career.  So I'm wondering, beyond the idea of creating tax incentives for retaining domestic jobs, how does this help the nation as a whole?  If Mexico can build a consumer electronic for $3, and we can do it for $4, how does offering a tax incentive affect the final consumer price of said item?  Should the consumer be asked to pay more to retain a job that no longer makes economic sense?  Again, I'm not attacking you or your idea here.  I want to understand your thinking.  My perspective on this, given the difficulty in making labor liquid, is that there is opportunity in shedding these jobs that no longer make sense.  Again, speaking on the macro perspective, a depressed pool of labor breeds opportunity for new products and new industry.  For example, if I have invented a product, but I cannot afford to take the plunge and hire some people to build it when the going labor rate is $20, then my product doesn't take off.  If a plant shuts down in my area, I may find some people willing to do it for $15, and suddenly I can afford to hire a few guys to make the product work.  If I have a good product, it could take off and I'm hiring twenty, fifty, a hundred people.  Wages go up to retain good labor.  Efficiencies increase, allowing me to divert money to new applications, resulting in even more jobs at a higher wage.  This is how the computer came about, or software publishers get started.  Displacement results in people willing to try something new, which can grow into something better.  The capitalism axiom of creative destruction applies to outsourcing.  Yes, again it is hard on the worker, but new industry breeds security, while dying industries rarely can be saved.  Of course my example is intended in general terms, from the macro perspective.  And this segues into my question about Gates vs. The Mother.  First, I should make it clear that I do admire and respect what she did for the poor over there.  No doubt about it, I could never do it, and she deserves praise.  However in terms of actual benefit for humanity (as opposed to Seattle residents vs. Calcutta residents) I think Gates is hands down the more useful human being.  You said that if Gates hadn't done it, then someone else would have done it.  Okay, same for the Mother.  Let's talk about the Gates persona vs. the Mother Teresa persona.  Someone would have done both tasks, but that doesn't change my discussion about which task is better for humanity.  You've obviously grasped the thrust of my argument - job creation, but it does go a little deeper.  Not only has Gates actions created jobs, but those workers went on to create products that have fundamentally altered the way business is done.  The effect of their work has decreased the price of about every product imaginable, through the streamlining of distribution models, the efficiency of cash transaction, and the multiplication of R efforts in about every product out there.  These second and third order effects have reduced cost, increased output, and raised standards of living for just about all Americans, and a good chunk of the world.  So in those terms, I'm not sure what you mean when you say that Gates has done 'no good'.  How is good defined?  Improving the lives of others?  Sure, Mother Teresa helped ease suffering for an astonishingly poor people, but her actions did not create self-sustaining conditions that offered a way out of blinding poverty in India.  She couldn't do that, because that wasn't her purpose.  The people she tended to do not have access to the means to improve their fundamental situation, and her actions did not address this shortcoming directly.  And that isn't her fault directly.  She was more concerned about immediate pain, and didn't really address the cause of such pain.  So can you clarify your criteria for good vs. bad?    And that brings me back to outsourcing.  Lets go to India, the turf of Mother Teresa and ask some questions.  Indians are figuring out how to turn the one commodity they have, brains, into a product that will attract capital and elevate their standard of living out of poverty.  They have entered the world economy, peddling their people as phone workers.  This is a real attempt at addressing the poverty plaguing their nation.  By all the rules of Free Trade, they have the right to do this.  Would you deny them this opportunity?  Which should they have - ten more Mother Teresa's holding their hands as they die, or access to a job sector that can provide food, education, better housing and hope for a future?  Which is the moral choice for India?  I look forward to a good conversation about all of this.
