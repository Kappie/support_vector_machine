But, they're expecting us to have prepared for it earlier. And I haven't.  Today's paper was a disaster. It was really tough. But the others said it was fine. Well, maybe I haven't done enough revision. I can sense that my results this time is going to be way different from the usual. And someone's going to come up to me and compare with me, and realise that I did really badly. Oh well. I am at peace. I'm only disturbed that people are going to be really surprise. Just hope that they don't ask why. The point is, Chemistry is going to be no distinction.  I really hope I can get down to work soon. The major exams aren't that far off and I haven't started my intensive revision yet. But at the same time, I really hope to spend more time reading Christian literature and do some Bible study on my own. Funny how it's hard to find time for the eternal.  My style of blogging is changing altogether again. It's no longer full of thoughts and insights. It's so dry. Reading it, I actually find that it is kind of boring. But I can't help it. I haven't had time to think much. Was going to thinking of why people sin, and whether they enjoy it. But I perish the thought after caressing it for a few seconds, "It's going to take forever.", I told myself. There's no time to think! I'd rather sleep to be more economical. Thinking is draining you know.  Some people are getting really stressed up. Teachers. Miss Koh's more stressed than I am. Maybe, it's not that stressful to be a Singaporean student. Dealing with affairs concerning money and other administration matters probably is more stressful than exams.  Looks like I'm getting down to blogging again.  What whould you write if you got 'Temptation.' as an essay question?
