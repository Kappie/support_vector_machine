Hockey  has  to be making enough money for it to stay alive and the organization to try and save itself. If the NHL goes down the tubes, thousands, if not millions, of people will lose their jobs. Not just players, either. Coaches, technicians, doctors, everyone down to the zamboni drivers. I don't know the specifics, but I really hope the problems are fixable, for the game, the players, and all involved.  Long Live Hockey.
