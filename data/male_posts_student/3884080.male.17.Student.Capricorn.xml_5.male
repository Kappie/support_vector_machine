She said she wasnt going to drink, smoke cigarettes again, or smoke weed again.  Well last night she smoked weed, and right before she did she promised me she wasnt going to do that, she said she had more respect for herself. I know i dont have a right to tell her what to do or not to do, she can do what she wants, but its the general promise that she broke that really hurts me the most. Out of all the people i know i thought she would be one of the few that has more respect for themselves than that. My overall respect for her has lowered now, i consider that one of the worst things somebody can do, make a promise to somebody and swear you will keep it and later on break it. Thats pretty low, and i feel really let down.  "This song will become the anthem of your underground. You're two floors down getting high in the back room. If I flooded out your house, do you think you'd make it out, or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs?And at your funeral I will sing the requiem. I'd offer you my hand, it would hurt too much to watch you die."
