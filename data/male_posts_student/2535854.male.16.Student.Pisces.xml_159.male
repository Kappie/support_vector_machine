Well, the class got back it`s Chemistry PEKA papers and appearently everyone did their`s wrongly...yikes..and those Kementerian fellas could be coming next week!Die! We then did whatMrs. Kalaicalled the easiest experiment around! Not so simple! No-one exaclty knew what to do and in the end she told everyone to stop cause everyone was doing something wrong. She listed out the mistakes of everyone ranging from having books on the tables, chairs all over, wrong handling of the Bunsen burner and crap...and more...lucky she didn`t write me and Zainul`s name`s down although we turned off the Bunsen burner wrongly...fortunately she didn`t see...but alot of other people kena..who know`s whats she`s gonna do...Crazy...   Sejarah test postponed to next week since hardly anyone in school because of Commencements practises and rehersals and crap. During computer class, most guys were asleep or dozing off as Mr. Ashwin was boringly explaining what he was teaching on Adobe Photoshop...yawn..I dozed off several times..Au Yong was the best and stuff...head on the table..sleep!Haha..  Then went home pretty fast...changed and went to Mid Valley to send my desktop for repair...it has problems starting up and booting...now it looks like that the Windows XP is the problem and Yusri is suggesting that the computer should be rolled back to Windows 98 rather than XP, but I had little problems with Windows 2000 Professional and sutff...so maybe i`ll give him a call and tell him..Sadly all the files on it could be gone :(((( And I didn`t make any copies!!!!But he said he`ll do whatever he can to try and save them..Well anyway I got this 128mb thumb drive just now which is extremely small and thin :-) ...also got10cd-rw`s and 25 cd-r`s and stuff...not that they are needed very often but are handy to have around if needed and plus I`m pretty much out of them anyway..Anyway got home from there at 5 pm and ate lunch...  Then did question 12 only of my accounts homework..and anyway went for tuition at 6:25pm...heh late by only 10 minutes!Not bad eh?Anyway met Dharmik there and I amazingly sat in front for once..those twins were at the back with their weird nerd like friends as well although the whole class turned around when one of them mentioned something about his pant`s falling off.Haha.Yuck.Heh. Anyway towards the end of tuition, everyone was tired and stuff and got lost.haha...  Anyway class ended at like 7:45 pm which is should actually!Haha! Anyway waved at Kar Leng and Ben earlier before class, Jahiliyah fortunately was not there and Mughni looked like a gay according to Divyesh. Wow I need to see that. I`ll likely then go buy his waredrobe. Haha.  Anyway after that went to MPH looking for another Ledger Book cause I forgot to while at MPH Mid Valley where I got a g2,g1 refil and a testpad.Yikes..they didnt have any...Bastards..I have an emtpy one, but save it for school since they say I need 2....well anyway tuition wont be until Friday next week so no worries =) . Then went by 7-11 and bought some breadstuff and a Kofta and Large Fries on take out at BK. Then mom picked me up near Pelita.  Anyway I got some school accounts work to do. In addition to that, I need to bathe :p . Toodles.
