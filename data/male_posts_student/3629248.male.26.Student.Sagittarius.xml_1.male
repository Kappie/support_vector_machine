I’m sure I’ve had a go at this writing thing more times than I care to remember. There’s a comic book story about teenagers with super-powers on the run from government agent types (not an original concept, I know)… a novella/screenplay about love seemingly shallow, far-out, all-corny and yet, hopefully,endearing at the same time (with a “kissing” scene that can’t be beat...!). Digging deeper, there is also… yikes. another comic book story, this time about 3 friends from a University who, whileacting out their Superbowl fantasies in a muddy field, accidentally find an ancient scarab in the guise of a rubber cockroach with supernatural powers and can turn dreams and ideas into reality (Ian Omero and Charlie Nakar… eto yungstory natin!)       A “frustrated writer”, a “would-be comic book artist” and a struggling medical student who thinks he’s in way over his head… and who hasn't slept a wink in over 40 hours, so i guess i'll have to continue this some other time. (hmm, which story to write, which story...)
