Tom informed me they were doing Life Drawing or something. Hmm, interesting.  I saw the new urlLink  south park  today, I recomend everyone goes and  urlLink downloads  it, if u have broadband that is, it used bit torrents which is gay, but it works. It's called fun with weapons, but u can see older ones to which haven't been released here yet.  My older brother is 20 today, go  urlLink Jon.   Not much else to report really, oh, the Nintendo DS to have instant messaging, and I started reading another web comic,  urlLink Chugwork Academy
