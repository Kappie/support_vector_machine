Play somethin else For everyone else I'm sick of this song It doesn't belong It used to be cool But now it's overplayed ya see...  Tell me Why'd ya have to go and make this song so overplayed? Still in the top 10 songs where it has stayed. And it's like this it It plays and it plays and it plays and it plays some more and it gets stuck in my head Over and over and over til I wanna be dead No...no.....no.  It comes on all the time Without so much as a sign Then it's too late, I start singin along I get sucked in, cuz I'm not strong  Play somethin else ANYTHING ELSE! I'm stuck on this song I cant stop singin along It used to be cool But now it's overplayed ya see...  Tell me Why'd ya have to go and make this song so overplayed? Still in the top 10 songs where it has stayed. And it's like this it It plays and it plays and it plays and it plays some more and it gets stuck in my head Over and over and over til I wanna be dead No...no.....no.   urlLink i found it here...    urlLink  postCount('avril');
