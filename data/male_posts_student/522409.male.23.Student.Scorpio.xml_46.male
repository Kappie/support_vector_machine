Anyway, lots of inquiries for Hyannis auditions, so I'm psyched... lots of talent coming in, and we're pretty sure 5 spots available, so that's... outstanding.  Looking at having to add Thursday and Friday evening auditions to the Saturday and Sunday all-day auditions just to see everyone.  Outstanding.  The Guru.  See it.  This weekend, ICCAs at Elms.  My last quarterfinal.  Then two semis and I'm done til April 26 or so.  Praise de Lo'.  The weekend of the 8th, an old friend from high school may be staying with me while she does an audition at the Boston Ballet.  Should be a lot of fun.  I'm really excited.  Something's definitely wrong.  My paragraphs are 1-2 sentences long.  Got more grad school info today... Florida State and Oregon.  The top 5 right now: 1. UCincinnati 2. Southern Methodist 3. NYU 4. Carnegie Mellon 5. American  ...with Indiana and Wisconsin coming in right behind those.  Really psyched to have stuff to look forward to right now.  Too much time out of school has left things feeling a bit stagnant at times.  But there's always the Sound to go back to every 9 months. :)  This weekend was a long one.  Drove to Burlington, VT on Saturday in a snowstorm for the ICCA show there.  Had a blast, hung out, met some great people, and stayed up there with Ky.  Was supposed to drive to UMass after the show, but the weather was too freaky.  Sorry, Seb... I was really hoping to see you again.  Anyway, Sunday morning, with my cell STILL blacked out (because the state of Vermont hates me), I drove the length of Vermont in freezing rain (took 2.5 hours) only to find out that the show in Northampton that Nate and I were singing in was about 5 hours earlier than I'd thought.  So Nate had cancelled us.  So I made it to the Pike and met Nate for lunch (after a bit of confusion), and we had a good laugh.  Then I drove the length of Massachusetts in freezing rain and got home around 6.  Then I laid down to take a nap at 7:30 and woke up at 8:30.  AM.  Today.  So 13 glorious hours of sleep, which is just about what I netted ALL of last week, then I drove home to NH and my father drove me back to Boston.  And that brings us to right about now.  Cait, hon, you're in my thoughts.  You know where to find me if you need me.  Ky, thanks for keeping me company for the drive to Burlington, and for letting me crash there.  Seb, sorry about not making it down to Amherst.  Weather sucked.  We have to hang out soon.  IR, yeah.  Miss ya.  France, shut up.  Notice how no one asks you your opinion on anything important?  That's because you're clueless.  And oh yeah, maybe if you weren't holding $4bn in IOUs from Iraq for the arms you sold them and hadn't succeeded in securing exclusive drilling rights to 2 of their largest oil fields, you'd be able to remove your 'tete' from your 'deriere' and do the right thing for once.  No such luck.  And I think that's it for me right now.  Nothing important is going through my brain right now, and that's a sign that it's time to count my losses for tonight and try again tomorrow. :)
