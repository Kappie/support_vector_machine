Maybe now you can see just how shite my poems are you can understand why I wasn't going to recite them but behind my computer at least you can't see me blushing. I rang the charming man at work today- he's even more charming on the phone (no wonder Deano met up with him!). Was disgusted to find out nobody else has called him, you people obviously don't understand how hard it is to be paid for doing nothing. Must say we didn't talk for long- he did have some work to do and I needed to watch the Gunners beat Utd 3-1, helping me to win 27.50 - arrrggghhh, why hasn't the fucking pound sign worked since I put XP on my computer. Is it cos every OS sucks? Yes Tom...even Linux. Listening to Charmless Man now I think I've realised some lyrics will, be very appropriate for this blog "And yet he tries so hard to please, he's just so keen for you to listen, but no-one's listening"  Ahh well, we will see :(
