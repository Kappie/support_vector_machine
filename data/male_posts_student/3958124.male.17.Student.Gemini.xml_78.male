White men in their mid-twenties to early thirties who call other white men in the same age group "son" and wave their arms around and try to look crazy. If you were black, or not dressed in clothes you bought with your birthday money from grandma, I might let it slide. Once, I saw Derrick Shannon walking down the hall, dressed like he just came out of a Snoop Dogg video, with some girl. She  must  have said something that he liked, because all of a sudden, he starts saying, as loud as his pre-pubescent vocal chords will allow, "Yea, SON! YEA!" He paused here, and continued for dramatic effect, possibly hoping she would look at him and register that he was actually there, "SON!" If you are white, stop this now.  Less male children, sooner.
