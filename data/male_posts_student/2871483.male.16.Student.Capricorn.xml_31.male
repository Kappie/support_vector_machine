Nah, it's no problem, because I beat Deus Ex and that new James Bond game.  But, yeah, next weekend, we're doing something, and none of it during Spring Break, because I may be going on vacation.  -  In other news, I am confused.  If somebody (by somebody I mean Zak, Kyle, or Felix) could explain to me how it's possible to have Paul Denton and Jock come back in Invisible War?  Oh, look, a quarter.
