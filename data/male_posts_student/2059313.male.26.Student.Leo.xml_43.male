Since September, I've gotten involved a lot at my church, and I've met a lot of really great people.  People who I have a lot of respect for, and people (I'm finding out) I have a lot in common with.  I feel safer there, more than I do anywhere that I can think of.  No one judges me there.  At least I don't have any reason to believe they do.  I don't know what I would do if I ever felt unsafe or threatened in that environment.  I'm thankful for that place.  Thank you God, for giving us the gifts of friendship, compassion, and grace.
