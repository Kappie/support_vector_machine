Once again...I'm sittin' down in Comm..well, Comm 29, to be precise. Stewart's bein' a bitch, walkin' around, telling people what to do. For all who know and hate her, say "aye!". I can see plenty of hands already...  For all who don't? Let's just say..the injustice of being a student, sucks. Totally. I'm definitely failing three courses...probably failing another...and thanks to some bogus messed up test, I probably can't get to summer school for physics, too. Life just bites.  Maybe, on the other hand..there are some relieving things...summer's coming up..summer school is coming up..so I can stay away from home for a bit longer...see h.e.r for a bit more...but then back down to the messed up life of hell in the summer...  ..damn, it's the end of 4th, i got to get to patel, talk to her about my poster...and see what'll happen to me in English, if I can make it to summer.  Take care.  (Insert: Oh, by the way, did I tell you I failed my Unit 8 Physics test? I got to talk to Skillicorn tommorrow ...and ..uhh..yeah.)
