I have an idea of what  might  have been said seeing as I did have a record of my state of mind due to the blog entry I deleted yesterday.   I'm sure she'll understand... right? I mean being drunk is no excuse, but she's done her share of stupid things drunk before. Maybe I should ask her how to apologize for something you don't really remember. At least Cissa is helping with the damage control.  ***
