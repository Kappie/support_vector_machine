In the past two days, I have non-stop listened to Something Corporate, The Juliana Theory, Switchfoot, Sugarcult, Sum 41, and Dashboard Confessional. I am trying to listen to all the music, and its working. I am starting to recognize almost all the tunes by the first few seconds of song...  So today i woke up extra early just to do the lawn work, and I am now 15 dollars richer. So i finished that up, then i played Crash all morning, and i read like 5 pages in G, G,  S. I basically talked to Brittney all day.  When I woke up in the morning, my mom surprised me with the news that im not going to the marlins game cuz we lost a ticket, but thats ok, because it was like 110 degress out today, so i would have been really cranky if it was hot and they lost. So i stayed home, and from 2:00 to 9:00 i was home alone. I ate, and went into the Jacuzzi, and the Marlins won, and I watched reports on ESPN all day about how Shaquille O'Neal is coming to the heat!!! WOO!!!   Ladiiiiiiiieeeeeesssssss and Gentleman... YOUR MIAMI HEEEEEEEEAAAAAT!!!!!  So, I downloaded the Spiderman 2 soundtrack offline, its like the best soundtrack ever... Then my parents came home, and I am now typing again...  I want to go to Warped Tour so badly, but I havent talked about it with my mom yet. I dont think she will mind, except the fact that she doesnt like the Pompano Beach Ampitheatre very much (thats where it is.) So... yeah. Im extremely tired,a nd im gonna work on something interesting to say tommorow... maybe... if im in the mood. I want to see spiderman tommorow... ok ADD... bye.   I Dare You To Move Switchfoot  Welcome to the planet Welcome to existence Everyone's here Everyone's here Everybody's watching you now Everybody waits for you now What happens next? What happens next?  I dare you to move I dare you to move I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor I dare you to move I dare you to move Like today never happened Today never happened before  Welcome to the fallout Welcome to resistance The tension is here The tension is here Between who you are and who you could be Between how it is and how it should be  I dare you to move I dare you to move I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor I dare you to move I dare you to move Like today never happened Today never happened  Maybe redemption has stories to tell Maybe forgiveness is right where you fell Where can you run to escape from yourself? Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go? Salvation is here  I dare you to move  I dare you to move  I dare you to lift yourself  Lift yourself up off the floor  I dare you to move  I dare you to move  Like today never happened  Today never happened  Today never happened  Today never happened before    (My favorite song as of today... It may be different by tommorow... who knows...)  *~ I change my mind a little too much for a person that is afraid of change. ~ *   - Me
