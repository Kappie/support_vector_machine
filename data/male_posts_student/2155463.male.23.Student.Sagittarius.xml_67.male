I was relatively outgoing (for me), but I can already tell that I’m starting so settle into the mindset that I’m going to spend a lot of time in my room or doing things on my own. I don’t really seem to be apart of any “group” around here (I’m not a partier, don’t really drink, aren’t that good of a socializer, not that interested in politics), so I guess that relegates me to my usual “loner” status. Oh, and it doesn’t really seem like there’s any other Christians in our group, so that’s kinda made things weird for me, too. I’ve done a couple of things with Ryan and Josh (that’s his name!), and they seem real cool, but it just seems like I have this inherent pull telling me to be at “home,” to not try to do too many crazy things. Maybe it’s wise to keep myself out of situations that I don’t really want to be in, but it just seems that it’s also cowardice and self-defeat; I guess it all goes back to what I said in Sunday School when I was about 10 or so when they asked what our greatest fears were: failure and rejection. Maybe this is just an insulating tactic to try to avoid those two (as Homer S. once said, “Trying is the first step towards failure”), but it just seems to have so many negative byproducts, isolation and malaise chief among them. But this is only the second day, so maybe things will get better…
