He knocked over the town hall, the library, several police cars and the cement factory that he perceived had wronged him. Then he shot himself.  I don't think this is the last time we're going to see, hear or read about an incident like this. Our democracies are little dictatorships. Our elected representatives lie boldly in the face of facts; campaign promises are forgotten in the face of the slightest opportunity to abandon them. The situation, while much worse in the US, is neither rosy nor charming here north of the border.  People are beginning to realize that they've had enough. I'm not sure if we're going to see a conservative backlash, or a liberal backlash or a non-partisan rage laced backlash, but I think the frustration and powerlessness that many people feel has begun to fester.  Marvin Heemeyer, according to accounts, did his best not to hurt people in his final hours. He simply wanted to lash out in anger at the ediface of government that mocked him. We may not be so lucky next time.
