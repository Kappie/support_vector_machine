The NPCC were the neatest and the Scouts were the worst. Their bugle band sucks like hell. Also, all their ppl looked like fuckers. The band did exceptionally well and the drum major was also zhai. After the parade, everyone was treated to a concert and it ended with a series of national day songs. After that, I went for the Air Rifle elections.  Firstly, we elected the 'c' team captain among the sec 1s. The elected captain was Han Wen, We think he deserved it as he had all along been helpful and had the responsibility. Next, it was the vice captain. I was one of the nominees, yeah! But I didn't get elected and got trashed by Hoe Kit, another sec 2. Perhaps it was because he had all along stayed in the schools for the trainings and thus the sec 1s got to know him a lot better and thus had more trust in him than me. I think it was also because he was a better speaker than me and had the support of the teachers and the seniors.  Nevertheless, I felt a bit sad on not being elected and strongly feel that Hoe Kit will never be able to look after the school team's welfare as he had just entered the club this year. Also, Bastard Zhang doesn't noe him and he also does not go to SAFRA to train. Since he does not noe anyone at SAFRA or noe anything abt SAFAR, he would not be able make contact with the ppl there and thus would not make a gd leader. He is unable to help us if anything goes wrong at SAFRA and is not able to help ppl like Zi Qiao who seems to have trouble lately. Maybe as time passes, everyone will noe that Hoe Kit will have difficulty being the vice captain and won't be of much help in the near future. But, I still respect everyone's decision. Only time will tell the truth. Fucking shit.  As for the captain, it was a tough competition b/w yi jie and yi da. Both of them had the same number of votes after 3 rounds of voting and yi jie finally emerged as champion after a tie breaker by a former teacher Mr Low. Congratulations to everyone and I hope that the club will scale greater heights in 2005.   After the elections, Bo Xuan, Bo Xian, Kelvin and I had lunch at KAP. Then Bo Xuan, Bo Xian and I went to SAFRA to train. Luckily we didn't get to see Bastard Zhang there. I reached home at 6.30pm and played Kick The Boss on my handphone. It was Zhai and damn fun. I treated the characters in it as Old Jahu. Yeah, happy day!
