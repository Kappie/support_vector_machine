Never thought Manolo would get a new 'do (spelling??). He got so pissed that time at Walker's. Was that the same night that Daniel and the Dutch kids broke both lifts? Bea, glad to hear that the interviews went so well. This project sounds like way too much work, but I guess you Europeans are all about large, end of term projects at Uni.     So Adam, are the late nights due to work or extracurriculars? I had a little extracurricular myself yesterday. I skipped class and work because Conor got last minute bleacher seats for the Cubs (baseball) game. Wrigley Field, where the Cubs play, is one of the oldest stadiums in baseball (1914), and the bleachers are a tradition there. All of the seats in the outfield are bleachers, and it's first come, first serve seating. Everyone shows up at least an hour before game time and gets really trashed. It's usually a bunch of twenty-somethings skipping school or work. Well, I started off with 7 or so beers on the train on the way to the game, then had at least 10 or so more at the game, so I was waxed. Then it started pouring so we all got soaked. Some of my friends (Conor included) fell several rows in the bleachers due to drunkenness. Went to an Irish pub afterwards (who would've guessed?), but it was pointless because we were too drunk to do anything. Longest train ride home ever, and then when I finally went to bed I started having drunken hallucinations about weeping willows pummeling me to sleep. Odd, I know. Had to wake up this morning at 4 to drive back down to school and finish a project by 8. Had a few Old Styles tonight (a local lager, the beer of the Cubs, brewed in LaCrosse, Wisconsin), and now I'm getting ready to hit the pit. Old Style and Strongbow makes a mean snakebite, A.     Trying to decide what's the best way to handle the blog when I'm in Bolivia. Not sure what kind of Internet access I'll have, and I don't want to forget anything that I see, so maybe I'll just write stuff down in a notebook or something until I get back. One of the guys we're going with is of European stock, but the other guy is an indio, and we get to stay with both families. It should be interesting to see the two different worlds of Bolivia. I'm thinking of all of you a lot as I get ready to head out of the country again. It seems like I should be expecting to see some of you walking around a corner in La Paz or something. Maybe they'll have a good Irish pub.....    So, funny story. This kid that I grew up with, lived down the street, came over to pick up the rest of his furniture the other day. He lived in my apartment last fall when I was in BCN, then he went to Ecuador this spring. Anyway, his name is Nsangou Ghogomu, and he's from Cameroon. He came over to pick up his large leather desk chair, his minifridge and a desk. He told me he was waiting on a car, then he would be over. He showed up and said he would just take the chair for now, come back for the fridge later. I just figured he didn't have room for the fridge in the car. So he calls 10 minutes later and says he should have a car in about an hour. I was like, "how did you get that huge chair home?" He says, as if it's the most normal thing in the world, "I had my bike." So, I'm obviously busting up laughing, picturing Nsangou riding down the street with this huge desk chair, but he thought nothing of it.  So if you see anyone riding around on a bike carrying large objects, ask them if they know Nsangou.     Now that I've officially written the longest blog ever, I'd better get to bed. Ulli, great job recruiting people. Oh, one more quick story. One of my friends, this Polish girl, went to see Poland play the US in Chicago. She said the entire stadium was filled with Polish flags and that the chants of Polska drowned out the American chanting. I guess they ran out of parking, so the Poles just left their cars in the street and walked the rest of the way to the game. I think Chicago should get representation in the EU with the number of Poles we have here.    Alright, now I'm done for real. "Do somethin!"    Take it easy,  Tim
