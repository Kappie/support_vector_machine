Ok, maybe not controversial, maybe just something that everyone wonders about! It would be interesting, ha ha! We could have a contest, too, for our audience!  For instance, we could say, "E-mail us your completed phrase to, 'If I was....' and it will be blogged about here on the web-log!"  Sound interesting? Ok people, get thinking and start emailing, now!
