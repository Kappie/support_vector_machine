On the other hand, the post was quite boring (as will be this one), but at least I like the title of this post more than the title I originally had: Another Uninteresting Post.  Of course, this title has no meaning while the other one at least warned you that you were going to waste your time reading this.  I'm listening to a Maroon 5 CD through iTunes.  I think they're much more talented than just about all other pop bands; they have a unique style which I haven't heard from any other band.  My liking of them may just stem from my deprivation of all other pop bands and as a human I happen to need some crappy addicting music in my life, but I prefer to think that I like their music for the original reason.  They also remind me of Explo, so I can't really  not  like them.    Its weird to think that its been just about a whole year since I was last there.  I still remember everyone (well, everyone worth remembering anyway).  I still miss just about everyone and everything, it sucks that I haven't talked to Ava, Kelly or Jenna for such a long time.  And even though I've talked to Andrea quite recently I still miss not being able to hang out with her and not being able to talk to her so often.   I miss being with Ava in the computer lab while she typed up some of the best Poems I'd ever read while I messed around on the computers.  I miss wandering around New Haven with Kelly.  I miss going to that ice cream place with Andrea.  I miss running through the rain with Jenna.  Wow, I really know how to bitch and whine, don't I?  I would have said "don't answer that," except as a blog you cannot respond to my comments and I don't really need to worry about you reaffirming my ability to bitch and whine.   In other news, my life continues to be boring as Hell.  'Cept Hell probably isn't boring, just immensley painful.  My mom and sister are out of town looking at colleges, so its just me, my dad and my brother.  I like it better this way; neither one of them really cares what I'm doing; I feel much more free.  I'm really glad that I'm not a social person, it would suck if I couldn't enjoy being alone for long periods of time.    Adrienne and I may possibly hang out tomorrow.  I invited her to hang out tonite, but I called at around 9 and she said that she still had homework to do.  It sounded very much like an excuse to avoid me, but I don't particularly care too much.  I took the first step to try to re-establish a friendship between the two of us.  I'll just have to see where things go.  Well, I'm done for today.    - Brian
