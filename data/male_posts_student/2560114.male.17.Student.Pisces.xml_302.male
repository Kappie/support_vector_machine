Today we were in a 3 team pool so its alright cuz we have to get out a bit earlier than usual. In our 1st match of the day, we had to play SAVBA(team from san antonio). All i can say is...we whooped their asses pretty badly...i forgot the score...but it was bad for them. But our 2nd match we had to play club Opiona'a or something like that(theyre from hawaii)...at the beginning of the match they gave us sea shelled necklaces and macadamian nutz...so theyre my favorite team of the j.o.'s cuz they gave us free stuff...haha. But we lost to them in 2...it was close, but we jus couldnt keep our lead...like alwayz...so we lost. Then after that, we went to the mall for a bit and then went back to our hotels. Well tomorrow is the last day of competition. We have playoffs at 12:00 and that would b it, we're goin to play in the flight 4 playoffs...basically the crap of the crap playin to win...pretty lame i must say...then im headin home for the 4th..w00 h00! I can't wait to c steph again...payce outside!
