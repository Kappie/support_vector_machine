His computer etiquette needs a little work -.-. This is the long-awaited post that has been delayed by parties, sleep, and (something else). It's pretty much just gonna go into some detail about the stuff that's been happening lately, at least what I can remember of it. Some of it goes back a whole three days and my memory is kinda hazy between 1.5 and 4.5 days. If I remember it for longer than 4.5 days, then I'll remember it for a long while, usually.  Ok, so let's start with how I am doing now and what I feel like because god knows that this post will be so long that I'll forget what I meant to say at the start. I keep forgetting it actually, as I type these introductory sentences so whatever...  Anyway, I miss my G4 TiBook. I sent it in for repair and I wont get it back for like a week and a half :'(. I knew this would happen. I guess that's why I've been putting it off for so long. The machine had ben broken since February, but I got it to work off and on for since then until I came here and when I did, it was all over and I just had to take it in. Sigh. Farewell, beloved mac.  My lack of my-own-computerage has also been effecting my music listening action because I don't have any way to hook my iPod up to this ancient Mac (I love it anyway) and I didn't bring my speakers from LA with me. But seriously, who travels with a set of speakers? That's the kinda thing you put on a moving truck. Imagine me walking through an airport with a studio monitor under each arm... Well, I don't actually have studio monitors for speakers, but I have these little BOSE ones that are a little awkward to fit in my backpack :-\. I wish I had cool studio monitors like that though.  So, yeah, instead of listening to music on real speakers (I brought my TriPorts (which broke in my backpack on the trip here), I've been playing it on my guitar. Recently, I've been practicing "Doin' the Cockroach" by Modest Mouse from The Lonesome Crowded West. It's such an awesome song. Check it out on the iTunes Music Store. Aaah, so much awesome in so little time.  Oh, right, and I also will be getting my full Massachusetts driver's license before I leave the state, which should be around the 23th'ish(?). That's cool because that means when I go back to California, I don't have to wait forever to get a provisional piece of shit and that I can get a real one right off the bat*. I'd stay with a Massachusetts license, but California has this stupid law that if the car is insured in my name, that the out of state (Massachusetts) license is only valid for 10 days. Fucking retarded californians. Anyway, that's good.  Oh, and I can't forget what I did today either because I've already written down a list of things I needed to blog about in the past few days, so before I forget, I played a bunch of guitar today and cleaned out the attic because we have to move out of the place we're in now so that we can move to California and give the place to a friend of ours. His name is Andrew, his wife's name is Anandita (sp?), and they're both exceedingly awesome. Anyway, cleaning the attic wasn't a lot of fun because it brings back a lot of painful, not bad, necessarily, but painful nonetheless memories of when the family was together and my mom and sister weren't fucking moronic, retarded bitches who let their "dreams" interfere with their real lives and practicality. It also gets me really angry to know that I'm even related to these people, but whatever, I have to live with it. It's not like I have a lot to complain about. It's the lot that god's given to me so I guess I have to work with it. Sigh.  On a lighter note, I went to see my old neighbor Sara, and she is still cool. A little more cool than before, but a not a big difference. I talked to her briefly from outside her window because she wouldn't let me in because she said that she looked like crap. She ended up having to give me something though so I ended up seeing her anyway and she looked fine. Girls, go figure. Anyway, she said she'd call me when she got outta the shower and that if she didn't, I should call her, so I did but she didn't pick up on either of her phones. I think she's avoiding me for some peculiar reason. Maybe she's so deeply in love with me that she knows that if she lets me come even the slightest bit to close, she could not resist and would have to make love to me right there on the spot and would never be able to let me go and will be eternally pained from my having to leave her to go to LA (just like in those cheesy** latin movies)... But my money's on it being something I said outside her window like "You know that's a logical loophole, right?" I should learn when to keep my mouth shut.  On a sidenote, I learned that it is damn easy to just not tell people what's going on and act like they're stupid if they ask you a question. It was fun. Oh, and I couldn't find the pruning shears so I wasn't able to prune the trees. Ah yes, and it rained. I love the rain.  Ok, I think that just about covers the day. So, moving onto the list of like a million*** things to talk about. They're not in any particular order though. It's just about whatever came to my head at the time I was making the list. I hope I got everything.  Alright, so I was interrupted half-way through posting this to go out to get some dinner, so I saved it as a draft and here I am returning to it. It turns out that a lot can happen in a few hours... Not very much happened with me or anyone that I ran into, but I just thought that was worth noting. Anyway, we went to John Harvard's, which is this bar/restaurant thing in Cambridge. It's my favorite place to eat in the Greater Boston Area, actually. Tonight was trivia night or something like that so there were these trivia questions being asked the whole time and there were these like 8 groups competing for a prize. A team of 5 guys each won 50 bucks to starbucks coffee, not bad if you ask me. So, after we went to dinner, we went over to the MIT Media Lab (my dad's old, but still going work) and picked up some machines to bring back home so that we could both get some work done. It was cool. I forgot, during dinner I remembered just how much I miss my late cousin. I wish so much that he was alive today because I'm just getting to the age where we could have had a really good time together, traveling, listening to music, going to concerts, hanging out, just everything. I almost started crying at the restaurant and my throat ended up hurting for a bit. I love John Marie. Rest In Peace, dear cousin.  Alright, so now here's the rest of the post... Damn, I'm tired. I think I'll just save what I've got so far as a draft and finish it tomorrow morning.  .. ... ..  Morning of July 6th, The Long Awaited Post continued... The Day of July 6th passed and I didn't get a chance to write anything so here starts from the very late evening of the 6th of July.  Ok, so here starts the long awaited post...  I don't know how much of this I've already said, but I'm too lazy to check so whatever. Since I've arrived in Boston, the weather has been amazingly good. It's a little humid, but great for this time of year in Boston. On the first night, I unpacked all my stuff and discovered that this house, being mostly empty and made of like all wood and not having carpeting, acts as a really cool amplifier for guitar and vocals. Mucho neato. On the second day, which must have been like the 3rd, I went to the mall with my dad to see Ali, one of the friends I have here in Boston. He's a hardcore geek, I'm talking seriously hardcore, like this guy is building a real operating system from scratch that uses only the best algorithms and has all kinds of ungodly features that even windows, mac os x, and linux don't have. This thing he's making is totally gonna kick all ass. Anyway, we went to the mall and we dropped off the TiBook at the Apple Store after like months of procrastination and just not wanting to do it because I'd miss him too much. Anyway, it finally got done and my dad and Ali had some kind of business meeting in the food court until I got back. When I got back, we, well, they really, started talking about how much Apple sucks just to bother me. They did have some valid points though. Sigh. Poor Apple. Oh, and I hadn't been sleeping much the nights before (I think I was on like 18 hours of sleep and this was the 7th day) so my back muscles were extremely fatigued so I couldn't walk straight, so I ended up walking around the mall for like half an hour like a cripple. Supposedly, I looked pretty funny, but it wasn't any fun for me. Then we all went down to Harvard Square and got some chocolate and walked around and my dad, Ali, and I talked some more about stuff, including business and Ali's OS. I think his geekiness is contagious because whenever I'm around him, I become geekier too and start to remember stuff I learned a long time ago about computers and just start looking at the world differently. It's kinda cool. Then after that, I think we went home and I chatted with a few people on AIM and my dad yelled at his computer and my mom over the phone (well, it was mutual. I could hear my mom yelling through the receiver) and I played guitar and probably fell asleep way too late. I don't remember very well, but whatever. It's my blog and I'm lucky to remember any of it so that I can write it down. Oh, one more thing, I think it was on that night that I made a million mis-comments on LizMartin's blog and managed to supposedly make her laugh. That made my day. Oh, right and another thing is that I ran into my neighbor and we started talking and I gave her a gmail account. Wasn't that nice of me?  Anyway, on the 4th, I was at home, doing the usual, playing guitar, taking a shower, reading blogs, chatting on aim, until Alice, the neighbor across the street called me over and asked me to help her move like 60 big-ass packages of shingles out of her car for her for like 10 bucks an hour. Me, being the broke and mostly unoccupied teenager I am took up the offer and moved all her shingles and got myself a whopping 20 bucks. Only thing is that now, even though I'm well rested, my back still hurts but from lifting all that weight this time. Wow, will I ever learn? Later that day, we went to Andrew's party, a former student of my dad's who's going to be one of the people starting one of the companies that my dad's working on with him (this sentence is really confusing for me, but whatever; it's late.). It was a good party, nothing too wild or anything, more of a get-together with beer and burgers and chips and bean-dip and cake and some other good stuff. I didn't drink anything though. I figured it might hurt my dad's image and when my dad's image gets hurt that means less money for the family, and when there's less money for the family, there's less money for me :-D. It's all so logical. At the party, I met this guy named Nick, who's Andrew's cousin who's been playing guitar for like 10 years and he's like 24 now and he's so friggin' awesome at it. I wanted to get a lesson or two from him while he was here because he's leaving in a couple weeks for Detroit, but I dunno if I can because my dad isn't too cool about it and you know how it goes with him. More brownie points with dad = more cash for ol' Feanor. I feel evil. Anyway, he's totally cool and after we were at the party, we went to see the fireworks, which were recorded and posted earlier :-P. On an unrelated side-note, Andrew has a very cute little sister who's like 15 and she also has some very cute friends, but that's all totally irrelevant. Why did I say any of that? I guess it's some kinda subconscious thingy.  Moving on, the rest of what I meant to post about is scattered and would take way too much energy to organize so I'll let you do it :-).  Here are the scattered facts about my trip so far that I'm just too lazy to find the proper place for in this already very long post, so I just threw 'em in at the bottom. I really like being back here in Boston and the longer I stay, the more I love it. It will be hard to go back to the fantasy land of mansions and expensive cars and millionaires that is southern california. I also really like having a yard. Since I've gotten here, I've been wanting to work out there, but I haven't got the tools to do so. I need the prune the trees so that they grow properly, but someone lost the pruning shears so I can't do that and it's been raining a bunch so I can't water the lawn, and the grass isn't growing very fast so I can't mow the lawn. It's just all very sad, but it'll be fine. It all will fall, fall right into place, in the spirit of Modest Mouse. Well, at leas I got to use the weed-wacker to clean up the edges of the walkways and stuff; that was fun. Oh, and since I've come here, I have a new diet of kix cereal and Total, which reminds me... I think I know how they manage to get all those vitamins into the cereal. They just make the cereal denser and taste less good by adding way too much sugar to cover up the icky texture of it. Total raisin bran does not compare to Kellogg's. GO KELLOGG'S!! Oh, and on the night of the third I think it was, I went over to a friend's (scooby) apartment to play his three pinball machines and I had a lot of fun.  I'd like to separate this piece of semi-random data from the rest of the mess though because it's of more importance to me and I feel it deserves some breathing room:  urlLink Christina  is so totally awesome for one, having a very funny blog, and two, for knowing what song I was playing on Guess The Song III and for commenting where it counts :-).  In other news:  urlLink LizMartin , another very cool girl, commented on my blog and I appreciate that. Her blog is more than worth a look, so if you get a chance, go check it out. It's Texan and therefore, good... Well, that's not always the case, but this happens to be Texan AND good go check it out :-D. Also,  urlLink Missy  joined the ranks of awesome when she participated in the ridiculous game of "decode my extremely obscure message hidden in 'Answers to Guess The Song I and II'". Her blog is also worth reading and is occasionally seen dancing naked in the rain or swimming and/or sun bathing at nude beaches. Let's all give a big round of applause to all of the awesome ladies who comment. ::claps::  Alright, let's go down the list... this, that,, that, got that, this, that, there, yeah, we did that, uh huh, yep, oh, what?, no, wait, yeah, we did that, yeah, that, that, that, ya huh, yeah, yep, aaaand ok. I think that just about covers it all. Damn, this post was long. Thanks for reading, and if you skipped to the end without reading the whole thing, you should be ashamed of yourself! Go to the corner right now!... Or you  could  just read the whole thing... Aww, I just can't stay mad at you.  That is all. -- Feanor   * Plus like a hundred bucks or so and another road test and some kinda written thing.  ** Cliché  *** This is an exaggeration. It's more like 18.
