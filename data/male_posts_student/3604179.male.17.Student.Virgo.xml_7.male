I went 1 for 3, not a bad night I guess. I just exceeded last years hit total in 8 less ABs. We lost 5-2 to a team we really should have beat. We made some solid defensive plays, and I thought it was going to be our night finally, but nope, our team couldn't hit anything... so we're 1-7. Highland Red lost to the only team we've beaten, so that kinda sucks, they are a better team by far, and should have beat them, but it was the same story. They only could manage a 6 runs and lost due to a rally it the 7th(last inning). Well, Better Luck Next week, Hopefully I hit a dinger, maybe that'll spark the team, lol. I wish I could hit a softball that far. I have fun no matter what happens, it just kinda sucks when you forget what winning feels like. Still a long way to go in the season. All-star game was fun to watch today, Sheets and Kolb together gave only 1 bloop-single up. Great job by both of them. Too bad Roger Clemens needed to not give up 6 runs in the first inning. I guess the brewers won't have home-field in the World Series, hahaha, I'm dreaming. Maybe a couple years down the road. This years team might make the playoffs, but I can't see them in the series, I will lose my mind if they do make the playoffs, that would be a dream come true. Well I'll write later, gotta go write my new story tenatively called "The Life." I'll tell you all about it when it's finished.   Justin "Slugger" Hurley
