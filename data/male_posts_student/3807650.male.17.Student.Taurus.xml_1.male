They did play well though, but c'mon how well did Portugal play in the last 20 minutes, i found myself cheering them on in the end.  Watched Farenheit 9/11 the other day, great documentery! Can't believe some of the stuff Bush says like "I call upon all nations to stop these terrorists with whatever means neccesary" or something like that, but thats the one that caught my attention the most. I mean, come on Bush you can't say something like that, because, believe it or not, people will do it and especcially the with "whatever means neccesary" part. I didn't explain that very well but read it a few times i think you will get it.  Forgot to say i went to Alton Towers last week. I hate rides and always have done, i've been to Alton Towers like 6 times with my family and friends. But this time it was different. I went with Kate her sister, her sisters boyfriend and Kates 2 cousins visiting from America. So i was thinking to myself as Dannie was pushing me to go on air with them "yeah...right, or not". So i watched them enjoy themselves on air.... oh fun. But i hate being on my own in weird places and i really didn't want to spend the rest of the day waiting at the exit for them to come save me from boredom. Cue: Mikes Bravery. "that was well gooood!!!" and so forth... "what we going on next?!". Nemesis someone suggested. I don't know what overcome me but i thought about how little people actually died on these rides and decided to go for it and jump in at the deep end!  I LOVED IT!!!!  Air going past your face so fast you can feel the g's pulling at it. Coor! Next - Ripsaw, okay that was fun, but not as fun. Just the part with the suspended 60 feet in the air with my face looking at the ground, legs shaking desperately trying not to fall, didn't want to rely on the actual harness to save me from my death. Corkscrew was great, even braved the cable carts which i've hated for years. Anyway that was the day in Alton Towers for me!  Driving: Getting better. Can easily get off at junctions now, never stalling. Even reversed into our uber narrow garage a few times. Hopefully passing my test start of September time *grin*.  Jobs: Applying for a job with CSC (Computer Sciences) BIG company which i would love to work for. Mainly because of the fact they use more complex stuff than windows there ;). Also Â£220/week at 17 wouldn't be bad. Hopefully having an interview on Tuesday, wish me luck. I've also got somebody who works for CSC sponsoring my through the recruiting process which helps :).  Oh and tomorrow is the start of the World of Warcraft Closed Beta start date, get your name in there! Find it at  urlLink Blizzard !  Mmmm Warcraft 3...
