Finals start Tuesday. Tomorrow the teachers have to go to class on how to give a test, lol. On Tuesday I have my Physics, French, and Aviation final. Wednesday I have Physics, American Lit, and History, and Thursday I have Algebra II. God I can’t wait for next Thursday at noon. I will be FREE!    Side note: GOD! My mom is being dumb and CRYING about WORK! It is fucking stupid, but anyways...   Today was kinda sad. I mean, they are tearing down Rancho. I know it is for the good, but still. It is Rancho, and it is 50 years old. I guess you would have to go to Rancho to know what I'm talking about. But the new school is going to be pretty cool.   Another side note: God I hate when my dad says "Don't get so defensive" when you get an edge in your voice. He is a fucking joke. My parents are fucking jokes. I can’t wait to go to college, or turn 18 when I can go out till god knows when. But yeah.   I dunno what to talk about. I guess I am just tired of school and stuff. I can't wait to be free.
