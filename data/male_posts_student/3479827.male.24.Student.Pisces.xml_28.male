I'm having mobile phone problems at the moment, but I'm hoping to be able to update this blog often in China.  It was nice to see everyone last night, and was great to meet Wendy, Graham and Catherine (And the Kung-Fu guy - whose name escapes me) It was a shame we had to leave relatively early, but we've got a bit of preparing to do!  So, goodbye from the UK and hopefully the next update will be after my arrival half-way round the world!
