I expected a more macho and handsome looking guy, someone to match up to the PRETTY cousin of mine (Happy?). His specs made him look nerdy and old, exactly like those nerds in the TV Dramas.  He is exactly like those nerds, aiming for high marks, extremely sentimental and sensitive to their emotions, then when they get heartbroken, they lose their minds and cannot accept it, then they decide to die together... :(   Oh well, bad points aside, he seems like a pretty nice chap.  Will be watching the Euro 2004 matcheS today, especially the Holland vs Germany. I'm hoping that Germany will win!   Well.. then 2 Face to Screen experiences today... how about that?
