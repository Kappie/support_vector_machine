Rediscovered Primus this evening, had forgotten how much I liked them. We played some Munchkin (crazy card game), our newest cards did in fact add some needed spice and the purchase gains my thumbs up approval. Was disapointed to learn my Aunt Del was in town and didn't call me. Not only did she snub me, left my mail at my dreaded mothers. Lucky my sister loves me and is gonna go pick up. After several days with no posts, you'd think I'd have a lot to preamble on about and I DID. Except here I sit all lost, hockey having left me drained I think. Well that and several hours of Tetris while listening to my roommate download music he swears he never had owned or oven heard before and arguing movie semantics.
