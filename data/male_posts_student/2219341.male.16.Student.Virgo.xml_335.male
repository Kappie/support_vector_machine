    
       then you look at me... and I always see... what I have been searching for... I'm lost as can be... then you look at me... and I am not lost anymore... and you say you see... when you look at me... the reason you love life so... though lost I have been... I find love again... and life just keeps on running... and life just keeps on running... you look at me and life comes from you.
