I just seem to think that my "friends" cant cope with me being sad and lonly and depressed and so they r pushing me away from them selves. I mean my best friend has now like become best friends with my other friend (and this may sound petty but they are all i have ) and well they have all there things and i have nothing. I am sure they want me out of their little "group" and so i am moving. I spend all my time at school on my own now and they dont miss me. I just cant seem to fit in with them. But i have 2 days left at the prep so it wont last for long right? I was looking at my mates phone and there was a txt from SAM! It went on to say: "what r u saying to him aparently he is cronically depressed. why what has he said to you?" I never talk about my friends behind their backs ever unless it is praise. I would rather they said it to my face (as one did) and even then that involved them bitching about me so i dont have any friends i have decided. i mean people only hurt you i am better off without them.
