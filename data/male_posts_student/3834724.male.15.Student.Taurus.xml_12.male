Anyway, I need to stop making things big. But, this is the only way to released my feelings when I'm upset, angry, sad, happy or whatever. Teehee. So, enjoy your day, and please, take care of yourself, your health, and study smart. May God always be with you. May Luck always by your side. You can do it!! You are still the best in my heart. ^^ At last, but not least, the same old boring sentence :  "No matter what happen, I'll always be with you, as you've won a place in my heart."
