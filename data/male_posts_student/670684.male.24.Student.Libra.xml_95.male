But even better is Ari Fleischer's  urlLink comment  that "there are people comfortable doing nothing" to fight for what Bush referred to on Tuesday as "the freedom of the Iraqi people."    Forgive me if I'm wrong, for as an English undergrad I always assumed that Nuculah was in fact supposed to be Nuclear (but since my omnipotent president says otherwise, I better get in line), but I seem to remember that Mandela spent nearly 30 years in prison because he fought for the freedom of the undermined peoples of a governmental regime that slaughtered their own people.  And I also seem to remember that Ronald Reagan made no effort to help Mandela's fight, even though Reagan's country had aboloshed discriminatory laws in the 1960s.  And considering George Bush was recently described as  Reagan's Heir , I have a hard time believing that Bush is all too knowledgable of Mandela's willingness to  urlLink fight the bad guys .    Here's a thought...maybe Iraq isn't such a threat after all.  I'm not a Hussein apologist, but I am definitely in the camp of "Why should I need to be sold on something, unless it never really was a threat in the first place?"  In other fun political news, I watched enough of the  urlLink State of the Union  to be sick; it always brings me joy to see that politicians are A+ students in shameless pandering.  What was arguably worse, though, was NBC News' idea to hold a Republican Focus Group after the speech, gathering the all-important Everyman Republican Response from the people.  There wasn't much time, so the moderator asked everyone in the group to say two words that best illustrated Bush's speech.  My favorites:      - Corageous Determinism      - Inspired Vernacular      - SmokingGun Provided (they were only allowed two words, so I'm guessing this is how she fudged it) My choice on the matter is frowned upon by my web server, so I'll  urlLink link  to a search on the words, and let you figure it out.
