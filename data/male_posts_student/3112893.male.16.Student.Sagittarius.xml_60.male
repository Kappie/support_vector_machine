January 31th, 2004  The Tale of The ÜberLoser and The Man of ÜberAspirations  If The ÜberLoser is one who is addicted to computer games and wastes at least 3 hours a day on them, then am I The ÜberLoser? But if The Man of ÜberAspirations is a man who wants to do great things then which am I?  Well, it looks like I've failed in trying to break my SC addiction yet again, but did you really think I'd succeed? At least yesterday I did something productive to not make me feel so bad and today I went through a week's worth of math but I don't feel satisfied. I MUST DO MORE!!!  So, with that said, I vow to, at the cost of my sleep (if I must) to get at least 7 hours of solid work done a day. This will probably fail too though :-\ But really, do you really expect me to succeed at anything? Wish me luck anyway.  My self-assessment is "ÜberTormented"... Whatever that means. 	>>meowMix  January 31th, 2004  Hermit? Naw...  Socially Inept? Me?! I am offended, however true it might be! :-P  To be honest, I don't see myself as socially inept but I sometimes wonder if I'm "normal" because I don't feel much drive to ever leave the house unless I have something to do. Anyway, before I left the house yesterday, I hadn't left the house for 4 days and today I didn't even step outside of my door. I'm kinda surprised at how long it's taken for me to feel depressed and why I still don't yet feel depressed.  When I was back in Boston I had to leave the house at least once every other day otherwise I would go insane and unleash on my poor father. (Looking back, that wasn't very nice of me. Poor dude.) Anyway, I should be going out to see Shannon tomorrow if my mother will let me, so I will get to see one person up close and I'll be able to observe all kinds of other people at the same time. That should be nice. I'm looking forward to it and hope it will be as pleasant and I imagine it :-). 	>>meowMix  That concludes this installment of 'Blast From The Past'. Check back for tomorrow's episode.  That is all. -- Feanor
