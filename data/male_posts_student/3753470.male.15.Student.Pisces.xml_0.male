It was pretty good but some parts seemed funny when they probably shouldn't have. I now owe two people money and have none so I need to get some. OOH, somewhat funny story for you: Erica and Brittany pulled up in my driveway as I was talking to my Mom shirtless and shoeless on the deck...I got ready quickly and found that I had no money (well, like a 2 dollar bill and a whole lot of change, which didn't do me much good.) So I asked mis madre for some and she reveals that she has no cash. So we take the unusual approach to it and she writes a check. Rushing out the door we (Erica, Brittany and I) went and picked up Kevin and we stopped by the bank. I thought for a second and said "I don't know what to do...someone come with me." So Kevin and I stood in front of the machine densely and said..."Hmm, well I guess we have to go in." Needless to say we were like the most conspicuous looking people in the bank that day and we stood around dumbfoundedly for a moment before Kevin said he'd just pay my way in. We then went and ate at subway and lots of confusion occured in the ordering process and Kevin ended up not having enough for my ticket and Brittany had to pay my way in. So, anyway, that's how I owe people money.   I'm sad today because my dog had to be "put to sleep" (killed) and that sucks. She was bought as a puppy for mefrom the pound when I was like 4 or 5 and she was the only red pup in a litter of black ones.   I quit air alert 3 last night...I just didn't feel like doing it and it was getting to push more towards torture than exercise. I'm not sure ifthat's a good thing or not because Brandon is still doing it. Speaking of Brandon: I believe I FINALLYdecided on his position in the band...he's gonna learn guitar and be a rythm guitarist. With the motivationofbeing in a band and me telling him "Come on, you're holding us up you son of a pig!" he'll probably learn relatively quickly.   That's all I can think ofright now so, have a good day.
