Ok I woke up at like 9am on FRIDAY 4TH JUNE 2004...Ran some laundry and what not..didnt do much..Then met Redz,Shaz and Faris at the Mosque and haha we were like talking abt how Nik was gonna survive in Japan..haha it was funny..making jokes such as 'the guest has to wash the dishes' and you know..stuff...hehehe..  Then went home and just lazed around as usual cause I had Acc later at 4:30pm and I went and like the 1st door opened cause it obviously wasn`t locked so the upstairs room at the Bangsar Gospel Center can be accessed but like the door leading to the hall where like the tuition is like was like locked and it was all dark! So I was like wtf??Not tuition?? Cause like GB said yesterday there was tuition like normal..maybe she got my question wrongly but I think I coulda figured it out myself on common sense but oh well..hahaha..  So I like called Chaman and we had drinks at SFC which I hardly go..but like Coffee Bean is like I dont go often but you know..had quite often previously and the same with Starbucks Coffee..I err had a Lemon-Lime Teez Freez which was very nice..and it was surprisingly brown in colour but tea pretty much is but still thosr thingies are yellow and green...we talked alot abt how things are and other general stuff..found out why some ppl left Smbb Like Gagan who`s dad was uncomfortable with the part alotta ppl think he was a gangster and ppl made jokes abt it to Gagan..I mean his dad does have tattoos and bla but like hes a nice guy I hear..a paramedic even more..so anyway was able to have a drink and bla without even having to go out on that excuse!My mom though I had tuition so why not just stay and lepak?Maybe now I can go for drinks more often and not like get scolded or not allowed out!But ive gone out everyday these holidays man..haven`t really been quite like at home all day unless Wenesday which was kinda shitty cause the braces were hurting...  And Bangsar isnt so safe now man..like Ryan got robbed..although its scayr but afterwards is damn funny..Chaman got an sms from Ryans moms phone and like he said something and asked  2 talk in Malay and was like sapa kamu?Saya perompak.Saya baru tadi rompak member kamu Ryan Lee( LMAO!I was getting ppl staring at me cause I was laughing so loud!) so like he said..saya kesian dia tadi kerana dia nak dia punya IC balik..then the sms`s stopped cause it turns out Ryan only had 1bar...turns out he was walked back from U-Waye`s hse at night and along Jalan Terasek 6 or something he got cornerd against a car by these guys on a motorbike and almost got slashed..he almost ran away but tripped and hurt himself badly and like those guys tripped over im and the knife almost fell on him but like he pleaded for his IC back and bla but dunno la..theres more to this which im a little lazy to type despite the fact I have this mad blogging craze which`ll mean i`ll only make my next entry though a day late like a day late again..oh I dunno im crapping now...heh..just ask me if you wanna know the whole story so in conlussion Bangsar is no longer a safe place anymore!Yikes!  Riz.
