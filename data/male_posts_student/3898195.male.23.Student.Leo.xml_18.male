OMG it's so f**king annoying!  It takes about 2 days to gain a level in dunes. I did get some exp today, but it's more like backwards the time I've spent in. Last party I was in this lvl17 WAR (no sub) was the puller. Both times he pulled 2 monsters at once. First time Goblin Gambler and Goblin Leecher, and we barely survived that. Second time he pulled a Goblin gambler and aggroed a Ghoul on his way back. I mean... comon, if you see a Ghoul in the way why don't you run around it instead of running through him??!?!?!?!?!!? I don't f**king get it?  I was the first to die because me and this other RDM was serving as ghetoo WHM. I tried my best to keep the tanks (yes, we have multiple tanks and they all provoke at the same time) (I understand you want to spam provoke as much as possible but in certain situations you don't want to spam voke) and I was the first one to die. I've died in previous 2 parties before so this time I just had it. I quit the party and log out.  I don't hate Dunes, Qufim or Kazham.... I just hate people don't know or too damn stupid enough to know what they are doing.
