Jon and Brandon didn't make it though. I need to squeeze in time to hang out with Andy before I leave too. I haven't seen him all summer! So I need to make a trek down to SD within a week.  Heh... I keep missing Laine online. She keeps IMing me when I'm not physically at my comp. It's been a while since we've chatted. Hopefully we'll eventually get a chance to.  Work tomorrow and the next and the next! Then it's over! I also need to pick up a laptop this week too!  **
