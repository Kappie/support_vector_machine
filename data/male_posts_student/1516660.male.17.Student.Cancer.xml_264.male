First, we went to Marsiling market to eat breakfast and buy a few groceries. I ate fried carrot cake, siew kueh and tau hua. HaHa. Whenever I go Marsiling, I would always eat a lot of things one. My pig la. Heh! After that leh, Mother went to market and brought some lotus stem (lian ou), apparently to boil lian ou soup (dunnoe when). She also brought some CNY decorations.  My mother's back started aching. She decided to go to the Yishun doctor. Guess what? There's a long long queue. I stayed inside my father's car, eating Mentos (I asked my parents to buy a packetful for me. I ate about 10 Mentos, I think) while listening to the radio on my father's car. Somehow, the radio spoilt and I can hardly hear the lyrics. Why, it took me until the chorus for me to realize that the song is "Ode To My Girl" by Sheik Haikal. The static is driving me nuts. I guess I waited about 1.5-2 hours in the air-conless car before they are done. I was so sweaty by then. Ayioh!   After the insufferable agony, we went to Woodlands Central to eat lunch and go shop at Sheng Shiong. Ha. We couldn't find a parking space, so crowded! Okay, that was an exxaggeration. We did find one, very far awasy from Sheng Shiong though. Meow! Me and Mom ate hokkien prawn mee, Dad queued up to deposit money in his account. He ate a lot during breakfast, so he don't want to eat lunch. After lunch, we went to Sheng Shiong. We brought  hams  ! Finally! YaY! It did not run out of stocks after all. They were all in bags, already packed. HaHa. We also brought more CNY decorations and veggies. After that, we went home lor.  I went to Wendy's house shortly. Father drove me directly to Wendy's block. It was raining real heavily. Yeah Wendy, now you know why I didn't get wet. Ha. I watched her pack her wardrobe. She has a lot of clothes man! Ha. Soon, we opened the box of mahjong Wendy brought. Woah lao! That Wilson (Wendy's colleague) go and wrap the MahJong all in scotch-tapes. So difficult to open, and there were remants of the tape on the tiles, making them sticky. We had to wash them, which is very very difficult. Ergh!  Halfway, Wendy's father came back. I was like O.o, because I don't really have a good impression of her Dad ma. We continued washing and washing, until her Dad volunteered to help us wash. So good of him. HaHa.   At 4 something, KL came over lor. Actually, Wendy went to fetch him form 888. It was pouring man! He brought chicken rice for me and Wendy (I paid him back of course!). HaHa.  After washing and wiping the tiles, we were ready to play. Me, KaiLun, Wendy and Wendy's mom played MahJong. Woah lao. Wendy's mother and KaiLun so good at the game. They even know what tile each other wants to win. HaHa. Wendy's mother even know I got a pong when I picked up a tile. I only said "Ohh..." softly. She's an expert man! According to her, she hasn't played for 10 years. Woah. Oh yes, we played in the corridor. HaHa. What an odd place to play MahJong. We took a sort break to eat dinner, then resumed playing. In total, I only won 2 times. Auntie won the majority of the games, and everyone won at least once. HaHa. We stopped at 7, when I have to go back. What a good game. I am looking forward to Thursday's game, when we can play longer! HaHa!!  I came back, bathed (so wet!! It was raining. Rain rain rain! Ergh!) and watched some TV. Tada. I am online. (I use tada a lot nowadays. HaHa!) Tomorrow I am eating roti prata for breakfast, and probably on Wednesday too. See, I already planned out my breakfast. Tomorrow Mother and I are buying the mandarian oranges from Shop N Save. Looks like their oranges are the cheapest after all. Ha!   alright, looks like I better go now. See, this entry is longer than Sat's and Sun's. HaHaHa! Told ya so. Alright, stopping le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
