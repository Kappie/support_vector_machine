It doesn't hold anything for me except mysticism, wasted days and already cliched rules to live by.  No, sometimes I lose faith in something much more important to me than religion.  My ability to write.    They say in the Bible that Jacob wrestled with an angel, who finally yielded to him.  More often than not I feel mangled by the words I'm trying to control, surrounded by a gang of them that pummel me with sticks until everything shines away into ebony.    Today I went to one of those lovely required reading events at college, and saw people well nigh avoid me.  I was not welcomed.  I didn't fit in there.  I see people winning awards because they're part of some hidden community that I'm never going to be a part of.  Some of these "writers" have skill.  Others...do not.  I'm not bitter.  I just wish I belonged to the literary Illuminati around here.
