       
      A new school year has begun. Challenging this year will be, I think.  Taking some honors classes (spanish 2: argh!) and I'm also in a class full of seniors. (they made it open for juniors this year, but I don't know how many people took it, I'm the only junior in my class!) I'm taking Chemistry, which looks like it might be my favorite class...  Now that I'm back to school, and I'll probably have alot more homework this year, I won't be posting here as much, but I'll try to post weekly.  Spanish: now there's a class where I need the babel fish.
