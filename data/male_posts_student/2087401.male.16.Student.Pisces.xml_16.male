They don't necessarily convey anything about my conscious, actual life.  Just because I dream about someone doesn't mean I'm secretly in love with them.  I'm putting myself out there with this and some people I know are not being all together supportive of that and I'm starting to feel there are now dreams that I can't post here.  And if that's true, then what's the point?  Here's the deal.  If you want to comment on my dreams, that's fine, but no snap judgements!  Accept that I have no control of what my mind comes up with.
