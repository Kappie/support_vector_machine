Using electrodes that pick up signals from the brain, the "players" were able to issue simple commands without moving a single muscle.   Outside of gaming, this technology can be used for a multitude of services, such as helping the paralyzed control a wheelchair. Inside of gaming, well, it's just one step closer to a HoloDeck. Sweet!
