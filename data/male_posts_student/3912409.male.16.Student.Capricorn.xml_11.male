Now I can watch that then then my vol. 3 DVD that has just been sitting on my DVD shelf.    I went to register for the tennis tournament that's happening this weekend.... lol I never liked the people working at the Rec. Center, they don't seem terribly happy. I hope that I get teamed up with the right person for my doubles... I don't know my partners last name so...... yeah.... I hope they figure it out.    I finally installed a game on my computer after my friends became annoying enough. We played Warcraft 3 TFT for a couple hours.................... then I wanted to shoot myself in the head. I can't handle playing a game for to long, except for Mario Party. lol when a new Mario Party comes out my friend rents it and the four of us play a 50 turn game, which usually last about 5 - 8 hours.    o yeah.... so I found out that the earthquake that happend last night was a 6.1 magnitude. The red dot is basicly where I live.
