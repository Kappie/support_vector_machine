Suprisingly today was a day that went by very quickly...hmm...I've got a project group for French class coming over soon so I figured why not post a new message with my free time! :D  So...personal life time.  What should you know?  Hmm...maybe my reasons for starting this page...  Aside from keeping just a journal and such, this lets me say what's on my mind and that I hopefully get feedback on it.  A couple of months ago, I got dumped...for the first time (insert cliche saying here).  We'd gone out for four months (almost) and then she kinda broke it off for no reason, at least not for any reason at the time.  We'd been friends since 7th grade or so and we agreeded that we should still try and be friends afterwards.  The first week was, what I guess is normal after a breakup.  Depression, anxiety, all those negative feelings that I never really expirienced for a long time.  After one week though, she started dating another guy...  Ahh, such drama!  Group is here so I'll post again later tonight!  'Later Andy
