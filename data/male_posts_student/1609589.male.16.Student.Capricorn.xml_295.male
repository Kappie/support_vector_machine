Oh, here we go- a little something before I goto school for the day:  Someone posted on the blue man forums about a drumset being used by Buddy Rich being sold on ebay for $25,000. Me and this other dood were like "That's bullcrap, give me 25,000 and i'll show you what a REAL drumset looks like (and you could probably get 20k back on the offer!)!  Here's a succession of posts that made me laugh:  ShuChoMouff: I'm with AJ- It's like spending 5000 dollars on a dime that fell out of Leonard Nemoy's pocket at the mall.  Still useable, but not worth what people are putting into it.  I could go out and buy a way better drumset for less than 25 grand.  Ztorgo: OMG, Leonard Nimoy dime for only $5000? I'll take a dozen!  ShuChoMouff: I say that because i already bought 30 :-O
