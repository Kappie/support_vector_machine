The Aeta plant fruit bearing and indigenous trees to fight erosion, deforrestation, and to protect watershed and well locations.    Most deforrestaion occurs illegally with local government units (LGU's) turning a blind-eye.    About 1,100 saplings can be planted in a single hectare.    MOA set for PHP 27,000 per sitio.    Zambaleno (Zambales) is the language spoken by the Aeta in Tarlac.    Additional fruits that are harvested are sold for extra income.

Fortune hunters still hunt for Yamashite's Gold in the mountains around the Aeta communities.    Aetas usually know several dialects in order to participate in different communities, for example, Tagalog, Pampangan, Ilocano, Zambalese, etc...    I can understand why the Aetas feel uncomfortable around the military since there is a log-standing distrust of them when many Aetas would simply 'disappear' during the Marcos regime.
