It's kind of sad cuz now half the time I'm bored cuz I can't make a decent song, but at least the last song I made, most ppl said it was pretty good, which is a plus.  Other than that, at the current moment, there really isnt anything to say about my life besides "Hi my name is *insert name here* and I will soon, I think I already am but anyway, be a sophmore in high school. As part of my high school goals this year, I am sworn to vanquish all classroms of bad grades, smelly kids, and demons*real exciting*. Yea, its that time of the year again, its already close to school startin, but I doesn't really bother me. Except havin to finish summer readin but I'll manage. Besides tryin to survive another year in high school, passing exams, and working on getting a license, car, and job, I think my only other goals are to pretty much nothing.  With that said, I pretty much think I don't have anything else to say for this post.
