For those who don't give a fuck about "new age" shit, aromatherapy is basically getting high on strong-smelling candles. I tried aromatherapy once, but I wouldn't call it "aromatherapy", its probably in the marijuana/cocaine catagory. I was fixing up my dad's new house, I got a hand-full of plaster dust, took a few wiffs at it and passed out (hahahahaha, it think its fuckin' funny now). I don't much about it, I just go on Google and look for "new age" websites. They're pretty interesting, you should go on one sometime.
