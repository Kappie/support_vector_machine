I had an okay day, but unfortunately I did not get to go meet Dominique for lunch, she had to stay home due to unforeseen circumstances. Also, the script I had promised previously is now working, I had an error in my syntax, I am all good now. I hope you guys like it, and I hope you will comment on anything you do or do not like and any suggestions for the site in general. 'Tis all for now.
