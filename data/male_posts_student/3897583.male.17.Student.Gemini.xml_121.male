Students who want to give the test may or maynot be familiar to Basic/C++ programming language (though it would be better if they have some knowledge about programming). Students will be tested only on their logical and analytical skills. They wouldnot be asked to write any programs. Exun members of class VIII or IX are requested to announce about this test in all sections of class VIII.
