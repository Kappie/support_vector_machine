So my atrophied chest and writing skills arenow aching as I try to flex them again.   Some background: I'm a 24 year-old grad-student at a small liberal arts  urlLink university in the northeast.I came here one year ago after a failedattempt to integrate into society after college. Now I'm living with a mathematician and a chemist and  trying  (see: failing) to write a thesis.   During one of my first few months at my new university I stepped into the student grocery store to buy some microwaveable food (since I can't cook anything besidesthepiece of cardboard I pop and lock on...oh shit, oh shit!!!) and while browsing, I overheard the following, "Should I buy meatsauce, or is that like, offensive?" The girl was genuinely asking her friend whether some Prego might be interpreted an insensitive gesture. Now, prior to this I had been a big fan of the offensive humor. I never met a Corky Thatcher joke I didn't like. In the coming year I hope to be able to chronicle for you the in's and out's (I have a girlfriend!!!) of my life at this University.   So that's my pitch: classic fish-out-water story for today's modern paraplegic whore. I hope you'll be able to tune in for more installments.    today's sermon comes from the Book of Jacob: "So fuckin, you want tomake the first move on the bitch, here's what you do...just like, fuckin, chill out on the couch or whatever and then when the time is right just take your dick out and  put it in her hand.  She'll know what to do with it, foo. I mean what else is she gonna do?"
