The total fee comes from two separate infractions, one a civil penalty (about $540,000) and one a customer payback (about $550,000). That payback will give approximately 84,000  GGW  customers a refund of $6 or more from the  Mantra Films Inc.  company (based in California).  Continually under legal speculation,  Mantra  has been found guilty of charging video buyers without their consent by entering them into a continuance program as soon as they purchase one  GGW  film. By that program, customers continued to receive and be charged for videos that they did not order. A giant corporation that has sold millions of videos,  Mantra  was happy to close this case. In the future, the company will have to get customer approval previous to every single sale.  And while the law got the  Girls Gone Wild  creators this time, it's a safe bet to say that in the future they will definitely get off.
