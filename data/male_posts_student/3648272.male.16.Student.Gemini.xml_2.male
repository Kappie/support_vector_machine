And I do consider myself pretty physically active, a lot more than the avg kid at least. Between the 3-mile morning jogs, weight lifting, aerobics, swimming, basketball, and various other activities, I get worn out. But I’m looking for other things to do. God I need a girl, lol.   Staten Island is such a boring place it’s scary. There is very little to do, especially when you don’t have a car. Staten Island barely has any clubs (or at least good ones), and really no place where you can just go to hang out with people your age or w/e and mingle or meet new people or w/e. All it has is a couple of movie theaters. Other than that you can entertain yourself with sports or electronics. It’s really sad that technology has brought us to a point that we have more people socializing through the internet than in real life. And I’m not talking bout Instant message/email. I’m talking about games on the internet like MMORPGs and stuff like that that people spend hours at a time playing. I don’t blame these people at all. It’s the fault of society as a whole.   Anyway that’s all for now.   BTW- I hope everyone reading this has a great summer, seeing as though school is pretty much over.
