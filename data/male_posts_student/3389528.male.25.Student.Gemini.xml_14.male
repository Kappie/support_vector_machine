Like as I am typing this there is a number of girls in the background speaking with their best valley girl accents and saying "like" every like 5 minutes.  My campers are fine.  Funny.  Most counselor's source of frustration is their campers.  Not me.  Mine are great.  No worries.   Part of it is missing all my amenities of Boston and realizing that I am better off without them.  No regular computer access, no down time, no private room to lock myself in, no subway to get on and go into town.     I also miss Elenie.  I'm sure you know that.  That's a given and you might even be tired of hearing about it.  But it's like my foot got cut off and I'm expected to keep going without it.  Again, I know I'll be fine.  I really could use a huge hug from her though.     Ok.  Enough whining.  We go on the overnight tonight.  I love sleeping under the stars.  I am looking forward to it.     Quote of the day is brought to you by Fr. David Kongai at Holy Cross Seminary via Elenie to me, "He who has not travelled still thinks his mother is the best cook."  Peace.
