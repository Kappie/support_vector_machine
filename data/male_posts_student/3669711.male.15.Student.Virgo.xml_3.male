I love everything Sony, my T.V's, my VCR's, my DVD players, my Amp, my CD Player, my next Laptop (Vaio *shivers* so beautiful), My PS2, and my  urlLink MicroVault .    You might be wondering what a MicroVault is?  Well, its just a fancy name for a USB memory stick.  128 MB (the one in the link above is 256 MB, i got the smaller cheaper one), USB 2.0, other neat features like Password Lock, Auto Zip, and PC Lock.  Why, you ask, am i blogging about this little peice of hardware?  In reality, i don't know.  Its just what came to mind.  I got the neat little thing for Christmas 2003, i wanted a USB memory key for a while, because that mean i could download stuff on the school computers, that i couldn't download at home because of dial up limitations, and bring it home with me on my memory key.  The purpose for that was erased when i also recieved my laptop with built in 802.11B wirless.    I actually do use the little guy quite a bit.  Since wireless networking is far from perfect, i find that transfering files from my laptop to my desktop, or vice-versa, is easier using the key.  Just today, i inserted the mini-CD that came with it, to see the extra features.    My MicroVault is an important piece of my 'computery' stuff, if i didn't have it, i wouldn't be transfering stuff... lol, not so big of a deal.  I still like it, and, hey!, its Sony!
