This is due to two factors: I forgot on Monday (whoops), and yesterday, it was a combination between the weather being so crap with thunderstorms that I thought my PC might get fried if I had it turned on during the storm, and the fact I spent most of yesterday afternoon recording my cover of Soul To Squeeze with my bro.  Will post later with what happened today - if you see what i mean.
