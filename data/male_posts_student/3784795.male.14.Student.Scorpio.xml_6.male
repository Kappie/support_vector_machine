Swelling orchestral music didn't fit the theme of the film. Or maybe it did, it was just slightly overused.   Second, the cheesiness was almost unbearable. My dad brought up a good point, however, which was that they probably were tyring to keep the comic book feel.   Also: If this is to be a trilogy, then how will there be a third? I hate to spoil it if you haven't seen it, but they all know he's Spiderman, Mary Jane (lmao) Is in love with them and they will live happily ever after, and everything's hunky dory.   What the movie did have going for it was the whole time MJ and Peter's relationship just tore at your heart, how he had to just turn her away and disappoint her at every turm to keep her safe, and how she could just walk away, then realise that she wanted to go back just as the door closed again. That was good.   The fight scenes were awesome too, Doc Ock was a great villain, very well portrayed.   I say, go see the movie. You might like it, you might hate it, but either way you have to see it.   [ urlLink b ]ac0n
