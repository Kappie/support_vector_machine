My analogy runs a little like this: Religion is like a baseball bat, put it in the hand of a baseballer and it is useful and helps the possessor through some tough situations, but give it to the reckless few and it is quite a dangerous weapon. My analogy relates to the teaching of religion, religious rights and apparent "truths" to the blind and ignorant follower. In the hands of such a person, no thought is used and the religion is accepted as truth and all knowledge of tolerance ceases- morbidity follows. The person becomes aware of their newfound sense of apparent "power"; religion is a weapon.  Now, give religion to a whimsical, wise and thoughtful person, allow them to retain their sense of tolerance, equality and an inherent sense that they are merely human- religion can be a source of strong moral and faithful conviction. Religion can be freeing to those who use it wisely.  So, would you agree with this? Does this apply to all religions? Is the war in Iraq a product of the manipulation of Christians and Muslims both of the ignorant batter in nature?  I would say "Yes" to all the above.  The war in Iraq is fueled to the religiously ignorant from both sides. George W. Bush is no Christian, but he plays up to them to win the support of the American majority: the ignorant, conservative Christians. Over in Iraq, it merely takes this group to rile up their Islamic counterparts.  Post any thoughts by following the link to the right or by merely clicking  here
