We are a very rare case amongst nations having this law but its a strength of our democracy not a weakness. Its a small duty to all the other Australians who vote and also those that can't yet. I personally will be relishing my chance to vote when it happens an i cannot wait to be involved in our democratic processes. Now the issue for people that disagree with mandatory voting is that people should be able to choose. And they are able to choose. They only have to spend a short time at the polling station then they get on with their lives. making it compulsory engages people withpolitics, it encourages theminvestigate policies andform opinions onissues. In America people don't vote because they don't care about certain issues its because both parties are so similar in what they stand for that it breed voter apathy and disengagement. At present it isn't cool to vote althoughit may be fashionable this year as the movement grows to get rid of the symptom of America's sick system rather than to fix the cause. Many other nations get by fine without this system and i think in a perfect world we would get by fine as well. But compulsory voting engages with the average person. And throws them into the democratic system forcefully. If we did not have compulsory voting , this nation would be a far less democratic one. And anything that could facilitate Australia being more democratic is a welcome thing indeed.
