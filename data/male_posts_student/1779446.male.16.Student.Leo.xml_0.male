In terms of life.. it's been alright. Not too bad I reckon. I've nearly finished my assignments and stuff. I only have a drama performance left.  My drama performance is from Othello, with two of my friends, Hansen and Ayesh. Being Iago, (The evil villain who maniuplates Othello into killing his wife) was strangely liberating, and from what feedback I heard, I am genuinely good at being evil. (Maybe a new passtime I suppose?)  I enjoyed my extra hour of sleep as clocks were wound back for Daylight Savings. Been playing a game called N. It's a stylish platformer that is very very stylish, did I mention it was stylish? It's only 800kb so yeah, pretty worth while.  http://www.gamehippo.com/download2/download2_1945.shtml  Well thats my rantings for now, I won't bore you to tears with a large chunky post.  Goodnight! (I should really stop posting so late at night)
