Because we couldn't find a table at the food court or the fastfood stores. Or rather, we were too lazy to look for an empty table in the multitude of Singaporeans. Yes, Singaporeans. Typical Singaporeans who are so damn bloody kiasu. So to Swensen's we went. Ate lunch and of course ice creams. What's Swensen's without ice-creams? Then, this Raymond was so full that he couldn't finish his ice cream. The whole time he was complaining about his stupid chocolate ice cream, complaining about the taste and everything else. Eight chocolate balls. Eight chocolate balls. Eight chocolate balls. Throughout the entire time he was eating the ice cream, he was chanting this. Haha. Damn lame.   In the end, the bill looked something like this:   Swensen's  1 Jurong West Central 2   1 Calamari Rings  5.00  1 Frost Ch. Malt  6.90  1 Ice House6.90  1 Salm Teriyaki15.90  1 Grill Fish Samba 13.90  Payment56.15    Haha. Paid over fifty bucks for lunch just because we didn't want to squeeze with Singaporeans in the food court. I mean, typical Singaporeans. After that, walked around JP aimlessly for about 2 hours. Haha. Should have spent that time doing sometextual analysis or some normal distributions.   Talking about maths, suddenly remembered an interesting theory of Caleb. Caleb Huang. This guy suggested that when you divide the length of the first joint of your finger by the length of the second joint, you would get a constant. Haha. And this constant is about 1.5. Haha. What kind of lame shit is that? I mean, who in the world would bother about whether your finger joints will give you a constant. Surely we have things more important and interesting than that. Surely there is something more entertaining.   Talking about something more important. Prelims is exactly one month away. Yes, one month. Haha. Should be feeling a sense of urgency but here I am typing in front of the computer. Guess its my nature not to panic. Haha. So many things not done and yet so little time left. Studying is a torture. Yes, a torture. Sometimes, I just open the book but the information just refuses to sink in. Or rather, most of the time, I'm just sitting there with no work done. Sigh. How can this be? Just one month left...   Just one month left...   "Dost thou love life, then do not squander time, for that's the stuff life is made of." -Benjamin Franklin  "To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: a time to be born and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance; a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; a time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace." -Ecclesiastes 3:1-8
