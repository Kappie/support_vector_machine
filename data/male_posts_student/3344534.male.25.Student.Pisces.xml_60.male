"hey... most of the countries in the top 5 are big hockey countries"... which is true too... coincidence? definitely not... nope. the list also includes countries that aren't tocool to live in. which brings me to my next thought. industrialized nations need to help out... especially the g-8... and more specifically the US. we need to stop messing around with stuff just cause we can or we believe it's right.whatever actions we takemay be right (saddam out=good)... but it helps to take the time explain and get others on board (and have justifiable credible information that's been checked and rechecked multiple times), instead of makingour decisions and always thinking we're right (iraqis are going to welcome us and let us take control of their country)... which... in the end... we found we weren't right. it's a dangerous mentality when you think you'll never be wrong... cause you fall a lot harder when you are wrong. we have the means to help improve life around the world. we need to be a good leader... and lead by example. our intentions may be good... but our actions and outcomes are what we are judged by. whatever we do, we have to make sure as best we can, that those actions and outcomes will lead to better relations rather than bitter consequences.
