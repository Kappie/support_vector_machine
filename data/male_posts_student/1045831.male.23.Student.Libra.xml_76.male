Not very exciting night though.  Went to dinner with my parents and grubbed my ass off.  Nice fat prime rib and a bunch of guinness.  Then i went to the bar with toms and a bunch of my boys.  Got ridiculously drunk and had a fun time.  And now for my birthday present to myself.  I'm off to see my main man Willie Nelson in Fort Worth, TX.  Should be a great time but I gotta run.  I'll give you guys the update on those things are going when i get back.  Peace out all my loyal disciples.
