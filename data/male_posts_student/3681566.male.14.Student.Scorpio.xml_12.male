I am probably going to take LIT 2 in the fall, so I can become a leader for the city next summer. Among other things I am now persuing is a soccer referee for the Byron Optimistr Club, and a speaker/presenter for Pillar. For Pillar, I would go around to different schools and show them a presentation on how to become a volunteer! Exciting stuff! I now have 2 weeks to relax, and then we are going to Florida for the last 2 weeks of summer! Go get a tan, and look for some t-shirts are my goal. I finished shopping for clothes last weekend. I got these awesome shoes, and some cool pants ($69.99 mind you). So, I've been happy lately, and thats all that matters!  Mike :-P
