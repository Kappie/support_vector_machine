I can somewhat identify with Al (who plays the main character), who suffers from insomnia due to interesting things, because I am extremely tired.  I was up till about 3 in the morning yesterday,  talking with a new friend of mine.  I was at her graduation party on Saturday, we exchanged AIM screennames, and we were talking that night late.  Probably about 3-4 hours conversation on AIM, then throw in about 3-4 more hours spent talking to her at her party.  I have known her all year from school, but we never really talked.  She teased me all the time, though.  I came to her party because, frankly, she seemed a very interesting person and I figured this would probably be the last time I'd see her.  I was the only one from the school who showed up at her party for about 3 hours, then what seemed like everyone showed for about 20-30 minutes.  I stayed until all was said and done, helped clean up, etc.  Why?  Don't really know.  We started talking, and something just sort of clicked.  Weird, isn't it?  Both of us are people who would never start a conversation, but we are in a way forced to talk to each other and we really hit it off.  Oh, she just got on AIM.  Write more later!
