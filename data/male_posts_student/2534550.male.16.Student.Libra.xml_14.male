I'm sorry, I must have seemed terribly rude. I wont be there next weekend, but we will meet one day =) And as for contra or baritone, whichever you have a bigger sound on. All of us vets know that we need a bigger sound,  especially  on the bottom! And it would be awesome to have a full bari line! (Anyone know the status of Sarah Rudolph?)  The first meeting of the 2004 Blue Devils B was quite a success. Here's my side of the tale:  Me being my usual self was running a little late =/ I get in the car and random memories start floating back to me. I ramble on and on to my mom random facts and memories and other pointless things like that... well, not entirely pointless, because I was smiling the whole way =)  The hugeness of what was happening didn't hit me until we got off the freeway and look over to my right, and see not one but TWO Blue Devils trucks. I squeal for joy as we drive around the school's parking lot.  "Why is it so crowded?" I think to myself. "Are all of these people here for B corps?"  We leave the parking lot and start drving down the street in front of the school, still looking for a place to park, and I look inside the main entrance to the school, only to see a huge mass of people in the hallway. I see the silhouette of Charles, and at this point, I can no longer wait to find the stupid parking spot.  I walk up to the school and into the hallway, and the first face I see, is the one I had probably missed the most. I ran up and gave Shawn a huge hug, I felt reunited with my summer dad. By now the hallway is empty and I can hear a voice on a speaker coming from the gym. I walk up to a table, start signing my name, and then I hear the theme song to "Catch Me if you Can"  That only means one thing, they're watching our show in there! This is all real, it's actually happening. I walk into the gym and it's full to the brim. There are tons of tables pulled out, all of which are completely packed, and there aisles down the sides are filled too. Again, I'm thinking, "Are all of these people here for B corps?"  The intro is playing, everyone goes "chh" along with the pit, followed by a mass nostalgic giggle. I smiled the entire time I watched that show, it was an awesome feeling.  I'm watching the product of the summer that changed my life when I feel a tap on my left shoulder. I whip my head around to see none other but good ol' Andy contra, my running block buddy who would share his life stories with me. I gave him a huge hug, it's so great seeing him again. He's one of the very few people that I told about Magic. He gave me a pouty, teary-eyed look with a "No offense or anything, but I really hope you don't make it."  I knew that I was back with my family now, I missed these people so much!  I hear a familiar giggle from the back of the room, and I look behind me to see Chels and all my favorite vets sitting on a table all rebellious-like. After the show is finished me and Andy start walking back there and I'm greeted by a huge Taryn hug, followed by a Gabby hug, and eventually a Victor, Allison, Christopher, and Brookie hug. I missed these guys *sniff*  After the big group/parent/info meeting type thing, we all go out to the equipment truck and it's there that I'm reunited with my mello =) I spot a rookie trying to walk away with it, but I quickly say "Can I have that one, please?" in an almost teary voice. (...almost!)  The rest of the day was a blur, a typical hornline rehearsal. Not as big a deal for me because I've been to one this season already, but BDB is sounding good this year! It's great to hear all those baris. My jaw hit the floor upon discovering that we had five kids rotating on tubas! Holy cow!  The hornline is a little topheavy again this year, and even more so than last year, but man, they sound awesome. I'm sure with time there will be some more kids trickling into the low brass, but these sops are badass and I can't wait to hear them playing show music.  And yes, the mello line was terribly misrepresented, as it usually is. Only me and Nick showed up, and we got a rookie from Tracy, Chris's recruit. Yep, three mellos present. So far the section has four, because Meghan had a play to be at.  I realized later when I got home, that ALL of our first mellos left for one reason or another (Pheobe retired, Wesley's with BD, and Stephen's "MIA"), and ALL of our seconds were returning... crazy, huh?  Well anyway, the day was fabulous, I missed everyone so much, and I can't wait to see everyone again in two weeks (I can't make it to the next rehearsal).  BDB knows what they've got on their plate. They know that they've been doubted and were almost cut altogether. They KNOW that they need to kick some major ass and show what they're made of. That, along with the fact that our hornline doesn't consist of almost entirely woodwind players as it did last year (heh) is going to make 2004 an incredible season for the Blue Devils B Corps.  Oh, and I can't get enough of my DVD, thanks Chris!!
