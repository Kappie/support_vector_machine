Yah but didn't expect such a touching brotherly movie,  Won Bin  and  Zhang Dong Jian  really played vv well, i was moved to tears man. Haha throughout the show, there was no shuai ge other den the 2 main actors. Haiz... so my deduction that there is no shuai Korean guys is really true. But  Won Bin  really looks vv shuaiz man.  Oh yah, i watched it with me "brothers" and that includes my Part Alpha(Sec 1) Platoon sergeant,  Eldine @@ Haha long time no see him liao, he still looks like a little kid haha. Anyway, it was really good watching the show with my real "brothers" But i think " Saving Private Ryan " is still our favourite movie of all times... Oki wanna watch " Super Size Me " and more movies........ So tired.....Gonna do essayoutline liao...
