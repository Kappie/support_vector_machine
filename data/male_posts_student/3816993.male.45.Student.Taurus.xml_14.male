He suggests that sexual orientation is best understood as having two dimensions:   Kinsey may have put orientation on a single scale from gay to straight, but I'm more inclined to think there are at least two relevant scales. The second one is the fluidity/flexibility scale.  While we find it most fitting to describe our baseline as gay, straight, or in between, the tendency to flex and bend also has a baseline and may shift at times over the course of a lifetime. There are probably a sizable percentage with little or no flexibility, some with moderate flexibility or phases in which fluidity spikes for a while, and a few with a lot of it.   The “nature/nurture” debate over the origins of sexual orientation has gone on for at least 100 years. The ex-gay movement clearly sides with the argument that sexual orientation (at least for anything that is same-sex oriented) as only due to environmental (and spiritual) factors. The gay rights movement asserts that it is solely due to nature (or at least should be framed in this way for political purposes). Yet, Kinsey offered a different framework: of sexual/romantic attraction as being a range of experiences across individuals.   Perhaps this orientation is “fluid” (as Boese puts it) and has has a range to it as well. Some individuals find that their sexuality is more “fluid” (either throughout the majority of their lives or sometimes only during a certain period or periods of life) than others. This apparent fluidity might be a proxy for how much “nature” and “nurture” impacts someone’s sexuality. For some, nature might have the predominant influence: hence, these individuals experience their orientations as more “fixed”. For those wherein “nurture” is the predominant influence, they experience their orientation are being more “fluid”.  I commend Boese for willingly discussing this issue especially on a site such as Ex-gay Watch given the ongoing debates about the “changeability” of sexual orientation. Bravo!
