Slowly coming to realize, What you saw before was just a cheap disguise, And for a second, You wouldn't mind joining him on the floor,  And imagination dies a little more.   That's an even earlier one, I'm not going to post anything in any type of chronological order for a while, until I run out of back logs. I'm just going to go through and post what I still like the look of.
