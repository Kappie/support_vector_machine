Nostalgia is all around.  People take pictures so they can look back 20 years from now and remember how good they looked in that sweater, or what they barbequed that fourth of July.  I myself enjoyed my own dose of nostalgia going to a concert by the Presidents of the United States of America.  They were super popular in elementary schoo with hits like Lump, Kitty, and Peaches, but took an 8 hear hiatus (sp?) at the height of their popularity.  They've reunited and played at the Rose Festival for the glorious price of FIVE DOLLARS.  I had a great time, and so did several non-blogging peers.  They played all their hits, some new ones (yay!) and even covered some Beatles, Sex Pistols, and Video Killed the Radio Star.  Rick White said it best.  I always loved PUSA, but I never dreamed I'd finally see them my senior year of High School.  Somehow I think it will be a memory he sure as hell won't forget.  Love, Rob
