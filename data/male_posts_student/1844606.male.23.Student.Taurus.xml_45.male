Earlier in the day I read, "You think I ain't worth a dollar, but I feel like A Millionaire" will be the 3rd US single off of Songs for the Deaf.  I couldn't agree more.  Give me torro Gimmie Some MORE!!!!!!!  Now the US will be inflicted/blessed with Satan screaming!!!!  For those of you who haven't caught on, I think Nick Oliveri has to be one of the scariest looking dudes around and when I first say him sing/scream on stage, he frightened me like...satan.  And the name stuck.   Queens were on Leno, and I was hoping Millionaire would be played, but they did "Go With the Flow."  Not exactly a let down, but was really hoping to see Nick eat the mike.
