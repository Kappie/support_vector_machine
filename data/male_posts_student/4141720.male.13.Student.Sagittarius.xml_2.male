It is very funny.  http://atomfilms.shockwave.com/contentPlay/shockwave.jsp?id=this_land_af=0  It has been receiving a lot of publicity lately, so you (whoever "you" are) might have already heard of it or seen it. If so, I don't give a shit. The link is there for the ignorant among us, so bite my ass if you don't like it.  Oh, wow, I actually just WROTE something. I hate writing. Writing sucks. Damn, what has become of me?  *sticks head in toilet while deep in thought*
