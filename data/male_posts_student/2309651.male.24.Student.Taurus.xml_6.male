The mayor was off at "meetings" in New York when he should have been with his city at its annual showcase.  His absence is more critical this year for two reasons:  the possibility of Baltimore losing the Preakness and more importantly, terrorism.  As every legislative session passes without slots to boost Maryland's sagging horse racing industry, it becomes a clearer reality that the Preakness may have to leave Baltimore for a place that is politically and financially friendlier to the event.  O'Malley, of course, is against the Preakness leaving Baltimore, but in the same breath he is against providing the event a lifeline to survive: Slot Machines.  Why is he against slots?  Because it would undoubtedly secure political rival, Governor Ehrlich's reelection.  By O'Malley snubbing Preakness, he has shown once and for all that he has no vested interest in keeping the Preakness in Baltimore, and thereby shunning the millions of dollars it generates for the Baltimore economy.  If the Preakness were one day to leave Maryland, he would undoubtedly do what he always does when Baltimore gets in trouble...Blame everybody but himself.  Had O'Malley been at the race, perhaps it would have sent a message to the broader political community that O'Malley would not sit idly by to watch Maryland racing be put out to pasture, and that he would be an advocate for keeping the Preakness in Baltimore for a 129 more years.  But Marylanders got no such reassurance from the Mayor.  The second reason O'Malley should have been in at the Preakness, or at least in Baltimore is terrorism.  Preakness is attended by over 100,000 people.  If terrorism is to occur in Baltimore, Preakness would be high on the list of probable locations.  O'Malley, head of the National Association of Mayor's Committee on Homeland Security, would not have been in the city.  For a Mayor who has been so vocal and critical of the Bush administration's supposed ignorance to the plight of cities in the War on Terror, where was he on the day that Baltimore should be at its most vigilant?  After 9/11, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani attended the New York Yankees' World Series games as a symbol that he was standing by his city.  Where is O'Malley's display of leadership?  If he wants to criticize anyone on Homeland Security, be there when it matters most.  Perhaps O'Malley's political handlers, who have been doing probably the worst jobs ever in 2004 causing blunder after blunder for the Mayor who admittedly aspires to be President, should think these issues more clearly and carefully next time they want to schedule a trip to New York, then Italy.  O'Malley's continued arrogance will undoubtedly be his final undoing, sooner rather than later.
