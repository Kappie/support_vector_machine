There may only be a few people who read this, but I think they're generally interested.  Thanks.  Tonight we won our second game.  Next week we're playing Jefferson.  Should be a good game.  That's all about that.  Lately I've been thinking a lot in what direction I want to go with my little space here on the web as well as the halbe.org domain.  I really have no ideas.  As much as anything, I'd like to make an impact in some shape, way, or form.  It would be great to go with the plain Jane designs I see most people going to out there on the web, but that gets boring.  I really would like to expand on the website into a different direction.  The most significant problem with doing something like that is that my ideas are so simple and yet so complex in so many ways it's hard for me to implement and get going in the little amount of time I have.  It's hard enough for me to make a simple design I can expand on in a few months time.  Updating every page when I change navigation is not something I like to do.  Therefore I create an infrastructure of data files I pull from in each html file.  So when you look at halbe.org, you're looking at 3 files.  index.shtml, data-nav.html, and data-news.html.  Right now I've got something wrong with the news file as I'm trying to incorporate BLOGGER into updating.  I just want to make a simple interface my mom can use with the dang thing without having her tell me if she wants something on halbe.org.  So I have no idea what I want to do now.  It seems like all I do is just get frustrated on the idea of thinking of what to do.  It's an infinite loop of "I don't know"  Often I'm afraid to just do something because I'm afraid of having to do something over later.  I want to set it up right.  With my limited knowledge, that's hard.  Deep breath in, deep breath out.  It's all ok.  I read an interesting quote while I was surfing.  "I seek the truth... It is only persistence in self-delusion and ignorance that does harm." -Marcus Aurelius in Meditations  I really like the quote mostly because it applies greatly to me.  I find myself distracted more times than not when studying or thinking or trying to focus.  My inability to focus and concentrate are part of my ignorance.  In many situations I create self-unintended delusions that make me quite paranoid.  One example was yesterday morning.  The night before coach said practice was at 10:45 AM.  I didn't think about it before so I just assumed that was what was scheduled.  The next morning when I wake up at 9, I check the sheet and it says 10.  I know we have to be ready about 15 to 20 minutes ready before the actual practice starts.  If practice was really at 10, I would have to be leaving around 9:20 or earlier.  This gave me an uneasy feeling.  I doubted my thoughts.  I kept wondering if he actually said 10:45 or 9:45.  After all, I thought, it was around 12 when we got back from Keokuk.  I had to have been tired.  It's just situations like the one described above that show how much this quote applies to me.  I want to do the right thing and investigate and dig out the truth, but my delusions and distractions pull me away all to easy.  What can be done about this?  I don't know.  Deep breath in, deep breath out.  Pray.  Night.
