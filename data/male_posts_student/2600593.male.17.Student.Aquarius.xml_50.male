      Just got done watching the fourth Star Trek Movie:The Return Home.  Very good movie, if you like Capt Kirk.  Personally I think he is a moron, by tremendous means Picard is a lot better.  Also my good friend Justin Wallace has just finished disigning a new website, feel free to visit it at justinwallace.tk  Live long and Prosper!
