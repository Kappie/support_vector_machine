Then it started to rain, how fun hehe.  Basicly it was a good day yesterday, after that dave came to my house and then we went to his house where a friend of his (Tayler) and two of her cousins where there. There was a crazy old man there with Dave's mother...He looked 90 but he was really 50. haha, there was a bad part though. A really bad part. I dont know how it happened but I was drugged somehow. I dont know how but when I got home I felt really, really bad. My dad was like "Your on something, arnt you?!" I basicly got really upset because i didn't want to feel like it. I felt like I was floating as well...very strange. Me and Dave blame the chinese chicken I had for dinner hehe--I was the only one who had any!! Oh, and I finally talked to Andrew after quite a while. It's hard to contact him because he is never online! Well at least I have his email address for future contact.
