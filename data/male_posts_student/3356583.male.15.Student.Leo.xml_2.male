I came here with a loan. And it feels so much lighter, Now that I met you. Honey you should know. That I could never go on without you. Green eyes. Honey you are the sea. Upon which I float. And I came here to talk. I think you should know. The green eyes. You're the one that I wanted to find. And anyone who tried to deny you,  Must be out of their mind. Love those green eyes.
