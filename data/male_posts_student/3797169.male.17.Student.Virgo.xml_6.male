They say, "You don't have to put any work into a muscle car, they're fast right out of the box." Well, this is true, but so is a factory twin turbo Toyota Supra or Nissan 300ZX.      A car is only as fast as the wrench time you put behind it. Adding a squirt of nitrous or bolting on a turbo will only do so much. "There's no replacement for displacement." Some people say that and stand by their El Camino SS 396 thinking they're cool. But if you wrench on a car, a small 4 cyl. will kill an SS 396. Either way, it's however much time you put in the car. But an SS 396 with a super charger and some engine work weighing in at around 3000 lbs will blow the shit out of a 2000 lb Honda with a V-TEC turbo and nitrous.      There's no need to spend all your time wrenching on a little import, unless it'll beat a muscle. And if you can't drive, you'll lose either way. At Irwindale on Thursday, I saw a guy driving a pristine Mitsubishi 3000 GT. A real nice car, but they guy wouldn't even burn out, and he couldn't shift, so he only won against a pickup...it's so sad. And if you still aren't swayed, watch the second Ricer flick, 2 Fast 2 Furious. They even talk about how a Yenko Camaro and a Dodge Hemi will blow the shit out of an Eclipse Spyder and a Lancer Evo 8.      You still like rice rockets? That's cool. I'll see you on thursday with my beast.      '65 Malibu SS 606   Twin turbo, nitrous, C5 suspension; yeah, you're screwed.
