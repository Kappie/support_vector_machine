In April the Vice President addressed the NRA to wild cheers and acknowledged his own interest in guns.   But a source close to the White House tells NewsMax that Dick Cheney is a true gun aficionado.   Cheney's collection, our sources say, is in the  hundreds of guns, including pistols, shotguns and machine guns -- from antique Thompsons to the most modern European automatic machine guns.   To let off some steam (God knows he has some to let off these days), the Vice President has been known to go out to the federal training center in Maryland where the Secret Service does its own gun practice.   A typical Cheney visit, told to us by a person who attended one, included the Vice President  bringing some 30 guns from his own collection .   On the ranger,  Cheney would blow away his targets -- with Thompson machine guns, the latest German and Austrian machine guns, Lugars, MP5s, shot guns, you name it .   One after another an aide would hand the Vice President his latest armament, and Cheney would fire away, no doubt imagining al-Qaeda terrorists in his gun sights.   We're told Cheney is a good shot to boot.    Cheney is not shy about his shooting activities . Another Cheney friend tells us that at the Cheneys' Christmas party last year he  showcased to guests a video of himself shooting while hunting.    You probablly see why I almost fell off my chair reading this. Hundreds of guns? Wow.
