Anyway, the school (EHS) says in the planner not to attempt to bypass security on the computers..and they log this, so I wouldent reccomend it unless you want to get suspended. (Like I almost was, simply for telling someone)        Method 1: Google       Everybody allready knows this method, but you can use the google translate tool as a proxy. The easiest way to do this is just change the words in red on the link below:   http://translate.google.com/translate?=enu=http%3A%2F%2F www.(siteURL).com       Well thats about it for that method.        Method 2: CGI Proxys       This method is somewhat harder, you actually have to find things yourself. Search google for "startproxy.cgi" or "nph-proxy.cgi" keep the quotes.
