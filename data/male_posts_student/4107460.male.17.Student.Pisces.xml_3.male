I had gotten very excited about the possible hook-up with this girl at my school who was having trouble with her boy-friend/x-boy-friend. They had broken up and we were going to go out this weekend and we had been talking previously, but then the prementioned guy calls her up and shoots her some apolegetic and sweet bull-crap and has dashed my hopes upon the jagged metaphorical rocks. Well she is out of the picture, guess I gotta move on. There are plenty of fish in the sea and I have a really big net!
