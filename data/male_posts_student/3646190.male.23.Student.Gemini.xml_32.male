They made fun of me cuz my hair is not like black folks and they got a kick out of my constant squirming as they braided my hair. In the end, they could not do it because my hair was too silky and they did not have a comb. One of the little girls, Deserai, is set on braiding my hair. She will be mad if I end up shaving it this weekend... hehe
