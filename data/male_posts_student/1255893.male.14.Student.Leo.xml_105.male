NOTHING" don't gimme that shit. Life's only worth what you make it out to be. That is to say, if you have a bad outlook on things, you're gonna focus on the negatives of shit. So look up and have fun. Find yourself something that makes you happy and get rid of this shit like " why do things people expect you to do if life is pointless" i don't wanna hear it. I bet if you come to me and tell me you're the sadest person alive or you're in the worst situation..... i WILL prove you wrong.  I'm gonna take something i heard from a friend a while back. "no one knows how i feel! i fight with my mom all the time and they  don't give a shit bout me!" you know what.... if they didnt care they wouldnt even have you in their home. Ive talked with them and you know they care. As for no one knoewing how you feel, there are  millions of people who can REALLY say they're parents don't care. If i keep getting these stupid useless blogs I think I'm gonna take em off my links. because i know that people use my links and i donn't want others to get depresssed for no reason because of you guys. also they can get pissed of cus they have worse situations and they can even start laughin at you for sounding so stupid. so anymore of these crappy posts and i  WILL take you off my links, favorites and maybe even block you.  and if you have any stupid fucking reason to be pissed of about this, why not talk to me about it instead of getting childish and warning me because you don't wanna admit you're stupidity.
