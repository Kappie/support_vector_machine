We went white water rafting but before that we camped out at a trailer camp ground. It sucked, no girls...too many spiders. We had a couple of funnies here and there such as...Paul and I were husking the corn and I said "Hey Paul, look I'm corn husk!" and did some random face/pose. You gotta see me do it to understand what it is. Then we tried eating all the marshmallows and I was stuffed with marshmallows and Paul couldn't understand anything I said but "I feel like an oldman...FIRE HYDRANT!" Then there was this device in Paul's trailer that looked just like Mario. At night, we froze to death outside in a tent trying to sleep. We also watched Miss America, god those girls are nasty! Fuck inner beauty, America needs outer physical beauty, but no, soon they'll have 1000 pound women on that show that have the greatest personalities. Sickens me. Phonies. Haha, I'm like Holden from Catcher In The Rye. Their all phonies, life is a big phony. Holden, is gay and whines about everything and cries and "RANTS" (as heaton says) about everything, he's obviously a depressed homosexual. Woah, a little off I got, next morning, Sunday...we had pancakes, then got ready for white water rafting on the Delaware River. On the bus ride there, there were a million kids screaming and yelling...and it made me depressed thinking of the great times of the youth. How awesome was everything when you were around 6. Life couldn't get better, everything was good and you weren't exposed to the FUCKING SHIT WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN! Anyways, back to the water rafting, Paul and I went by ourselves and talked about basically everything you can think of concidering we were in a raft going down a river for about 3 or so hours. Well, we stopped for a few things. First, the funniest thing ever...Paul had to pee, so we took a confidential detour off the path and Paul got up and started peeing standing on the raft...so I thought of the perfect idea who I bet anyone else would of thought of doing...crashing into the side of the river. So I did, and down came Paul, one leg in, one leg out and he pissed all over. Yes, funny...ok so the river reminded me of the Lord of The Rings:Two Towers when the Uruk-Hai are near that river thingy...and the first one I guess. It was cool. Then we met up with Paul's parents and Paul's sister and friend Vicky who came along also. They all went together in one raft. The maximum is 8, minimum obviously being 2 unless you're one of those crazy caiyackers. We saw some, their amazing...and Paul said his 60 year old aunt has lots of form and can go really fast, I thought that was awesome. I think it's because Jewish people live longer. Oh, yes and I forgot to mention I converted to Jeudeisusism...Jewish. We figured my dad was adopted and all, and his real last name is Polish/Yiddish which obviously leads to a path of Jewishness...and plus Jesus is gay...no he's cool and all, I literally mean he's gay, you guys see the paintings of him, he stands like a grade A flamer. Ya so I'm Jewish, all I need is Paul's yamaha...I mean yarmulke...and I'm still celebrating the Catholic holidays. Woohoo! I love taking advantage of Catholisism. SISM...SCHISM! Ok, so where was I...ah yes...lunch, we set out for the river again and this time we found a rope so I decided to fly on it...unfortunetly I ended up head under the water with all my clothes on and Paul dying of laughter in the raft. I did it about 4 times and the last time I jumped into the raft right into Paul. It was great...ok so, that's all basically except we found a $5 at the beginning/end? On the way home, my ego starting going up, because I wasn't near any spiders that were gonna make fun of me. I finished my English essay in the RV, and we went to Wendy's in Syosset...then to friends of the Stoltzes. They were moving and giving everything away so I took a 1970's turntable! WOO! Then depressed again to see my parents and my...old land of greatness, well not really mine, but my parents even though I used to always go there when I used to live in Lindenhurst concidering the very short distance. Uh..ya..good old Plainview, Smithtown sucks, Plainview owns. Nassau owns. Suffolk sucks. Well except the most western part of Suffolk such as LINDENHURST!!! When I arrived home, the weirdest thing ever...there was a bunny in my house caged in my kitchen. My sister's bday present even though she's not turning 8 till the 27th. Oh well, that was a cool suprise. Nothing else, went to bed. NEXT DAY...today, school, nothing except good old AP Euro teacher, Mr. Ferrante gave us an example of a feared ruler in Machiavelli's eyes, so he opens thedoor and screams "AND DON'T COME BACK UNTIL YOU FINISH YOUR HOMEWORK!!!" Now this guy sounded serious it wasn't even funny...well it was hilarious, you know what I mean, but he screamed so that the whole school can hear him. So he comes back in and then a teacher comes in confused when seeing us all crack up along with Mr. Ferrante. It's always great to see AJ's face...he can make your day a happy one. Then home, nothing but drumming, petting rabbit, homework, tv, counter-strike, and working out at Paul's. OK! SO THAT'S ALL FOLKS! GOD DAM THAT WAS LONG...
