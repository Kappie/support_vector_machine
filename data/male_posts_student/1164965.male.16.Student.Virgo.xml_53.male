However, after taking it today it wasn't as bad as I had thought. The multiple choice part wasn't too bad but I tend to take too much time reading and rereading... oh well.  The essays weren't extremely difficult either, and amazingly i finished all of them, even with a conclusion.  However the second one where we had to discuss how Emerson used the English language and conventions was a little more difficult.  Also, like it was said earlier, I noticed that Shakespeare was used and I found that to be odd considering he wasnt American, which is what we have been studying all year.
