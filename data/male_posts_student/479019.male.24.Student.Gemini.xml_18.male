I'm defineately not a man of action (like Arnold said about Riordan), and that's cost me opportunities in the past. Maybe I should really be a bit more active in some aspects of my life?  Teen Jeopardy is on this week... I wish I had a chance to be on it when I was a teen. Maybe I can be on College or regular Jeopardy? I know I can do well on it, as long as I don't get matched up against someone really good.   Well anyway... Jeopardy is over now. I'm going get to work on my paper for history of coffee now.  ***
