I should probably get into the habit of writing in my journal more often.   Today has felt pretty slow to me. I haven't gotten to talk to Dominique at all today, although I know she has tried to contact me. Apparently my phone has been ringing a lot, which bothers my parents, but makes me feel really special. I'm glad that at least one person wants to talk with me.   I feel kind of lonely right now. There are quite a few people online, but with the exception of one person, they aren't people I talk to often and she happens to be away right now. I think Dominique is either working right now or babysitting.   I can't wait for school to start again. Yea, that's the first time I've ever said that, and it feels weird. I don't know why I'm excited to go back. I think it's because I got really good classes this year. I am a tech assistant for the computer lab this year. Since I love computers so much, that will be great. My second class is going to be another easy class, maybe too easy. I am in Web Page Design. I can show of my skills to the greatest magnitude here. My US History class is going to be great. I got one of my favorite teachers of all time again. I got Geometry with a really cool teacher, who just happens to look like  urlLink Steve , the old host of Blue's Clues. My last two classes are English and Biology (I keep wanting to call it biography for some odd reason). I am thinking my hardest class is going to be Biology.  I still don't know if one of my best friends is going to Granada or not. She moved near the ending of last year, but finished the year at Livermore. I will be sad if I find out she is going to Granada and didn't bother calling me to tell me.  I have deemed it next to impossible to throw a wire hanger into your closet and have it land on the pole keeping the clothes up. After 20-30 tries, I have enough evidence to back it up. I finally decided not to be lazy, and to just put it there manually.  Anyways, I think I got out a lot of things I hadn't said in a while. Thanks for listening. If you find yourself in an exastential quandry full of loathing and self-doubt, just remember that there is always a little place called Albuqurqe.
