The whole day was a farewell, with the official church farewell at the morning service, followed by a shared lunch. The evening service was a chance for the youth of the church to say goodbye to Dave. It was an emotional time, as people shared their thought, feelings and memories of the four years Dave has been our Youth Pastor.  Personally, I'm really sad to see Dave go. More than just a pastor, Dave is my friend, and has always been there for me. Even though I know that this is a great move for him, part of me just wants everything to stay the same as they have been. I know that can't happen, but with all the changes recently, I sort of took for granted that Dave would be around forever.  I also spent a great afternoon with friends at Western Springs, a big park here in Auckland. It was nice to spend the time there, even though that park is one of the places that has memories for me, as my wife and I would go there a lot. In some ways it was weird going back there, the first time I have since we separated. Because of that, it was good to have friends with me, especially some I haven't caught up with properly for a while.
