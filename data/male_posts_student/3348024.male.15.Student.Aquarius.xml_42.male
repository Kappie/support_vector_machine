Mrs. Sherrick and Lindsey already know it so that leaves just over 6 billion people who will be suprised by my victory.  Oh, General Frye knows it too.  So does General Custard, and maybe Wookie... possibly K C but I think that's about it.  Sara knows too cause she's my side kick.  Umm... Amber, Sommer, Chadd, and Jessie might also know because they're in the KZKK.    I guess all you Kray Z Kidz know now too.
