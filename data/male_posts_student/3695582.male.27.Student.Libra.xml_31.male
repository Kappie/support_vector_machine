After a year and a half of making do with a blown ACL, to the point where I don't feel a thing any more and have a full range of motion (but don't trust it enough to do anything too strenuous with it), I'm finally getting it repaired/reconstructed.  I don't have a clue as to what I'm in for.  I'm blithely assuming that somehow there won't be much pain post-op, simply because I've forgotten what it was like to have this knee hurt, though it did hurt like hell for about 3 months after I busted it.  The next update will be the first with a piece of my hamstring tendon coming on as a substitute for my starting ACL....
