I'm addicted to this whole blogging thing, and now, I'm celebrating my 20th post for both of the blogs.  Yep, that's right.  It's been two weeks, and I've already gotten up to 20 posts.  It's an addiction.  No stopping it.  This is probably one of my favorite things to do online now.  Tomorrow, I'm going to be experimenting further with things by posting pictures from my trip to New York last Christmas.  There's only a couple pictures worth posting.  Since I'm going to run out of space on Village Photos soon, I'm going to give this "Hello" thing a try.  We'll see how it goes.  So, since my last post, I've pretty much just relaxed a bit, doing nothing, trying to recover from the first day of all of the bagel.tech stuff that I posted.  Remember, it's definitely worth checking out, because there are some pretty cool little computer tricks and links there.    Next week, I'll be seeing my yearbook croonies for the first time in about 3 weeks (except for Caitlin, who was in drivers ed with me).  It'll be interesting to see what's going on.  I've missed all of them.    Well, I'm going to get going for the night.  Today was probably one of the busiest and most unboring days I have had in a long time.  So, that's it, and be sure to check it out tomorrow for more stuff.
