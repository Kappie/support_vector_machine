So, I put all my lights on the car so he can't see me walk up and I walk up on the passenger side so he can't see me.  He is looking out the driver's window and I am standing at the passenger window.  I am about to ask him for his license when I see the back end of a  handgun sticking out from between the cushions of the driver and front passenger seat.  So I take my gun out and tell the guy to put his hands on the steering wheel and not move. He looks at the gun and goes to reach for it... I then told him not to move and he said... I just want to show you its a B B Gun.  I put my finger on the trigger when he moved and shit myself After the TURD fell down my pant leg. I politely asked him again not to move and to get out and lay face down on the ground.  So I go check the gun then, and it is an all metal BB gun which is painted all black and has all the functioning parts of a gun, only bb pellets instead.  The guy then told me that he figured something like this would happen if he kept the gun right there, but that he only keeps it there for protection from the rival gangs.  I don't know why people think like that.
