Yesterday: I don't remember much about the school day, which probably sucked anyway, and in the famous words of Dylan Curzon "daily incidents at school are not valuable to a blog, as you either don't give a f*ck, or you go to my school, or a combination of the two". Ok, so maybe Dylan didn't say all of that, but its pretty close.  After school I went to the Y and played pool. I don't know, but its just like the physics and movement of the balls, all the angles and shots, force, etc. Yeah, its the physics. One of my favourite (whoohoo! alternate spelling) games...even though I kinda suck at it. Well, sort of. I purposefully get 2 and 3 balls in on 1 shot sometimes, but I'm not that great.  My sister came over to visit yesterday (she's 21), and I routed her 2 out of 3 games in Speed Scrabble. Its like scrabble, only without a board, and the first person to finish a cross-word wins. Here's how it goes:  1. Each player picks 7 tiles. 2. You attempt to make words that build off of your other words (each player has a separate cross-word so they don't cross). 3. Whenever you use up your current letters (all the letters you had are in the words), you say "take 2". Then each player must take 2 more letter tiles, and either add on if you can, or trash a section or the whole puzzle and start over in order to fit the letters in.  This game goes really fast, as in there was a stretch when ever 5 seconds or less I'd say "take 2". Its pretty damn tough to catch up unless your opponent gets stuck and can't do anything. Then you can take a breather until you finish your letters and call up 2 more tiles. Its a really good game, but you have to be good at scrabble to play well. I've beaten both my sister and my dad a few times in scrabble, so I guess I'm pretty good.  Yesterday was a day of loss and gain. Sounds like business, eh? Yep. I lost 2 customers already this year for lawn mowing, potentially 3, but I gained 2 so far. My nextdoor neighbor agreed to have me mow their lawn. Apparently the other kids who did her lawn the other year were 12 years old and couldn't push a mower without being afraid of it. wtf? I was mowing lawns as a business when I was 12.  Dammit! I don't get to go play pool today at the Y because my mom can't pick me up later. I wonder what's going to happen with the drumset which we need to pick up from the school for tommorow night's concert. There's also 2 more covers for the bassdrum front for the RANDOM. I think that we're going to switch them every 10 minutes or so to be more random.  There's only 5 minutes left of class, so yeah, I gotta go.
