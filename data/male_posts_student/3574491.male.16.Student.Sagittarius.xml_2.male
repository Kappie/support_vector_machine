NOw, Moving On....... Yesterday Night I was out writing a few slogans and something in the name of a speech for our dear election candidate...who also happens to be the only person to read all the bull shit shit i type and also leave behind a very optismistic and motivating comment.......santhosh and ramkumar..............I give you ramkumar...rk...ramani....whatever your suits you,  So The latest news is that there is going to be some severe anti-camapaigning coalition kindaaa thing and i sincerely fell that despite all the odds that face us ....we , i ment our class 12 e1 2004-2005 as an entirety have a brilliant chance of winning and stealing the limelite as we have done all these years and hence once again we are gonna kick some serious opposition ass......well again i would like to emphasise as i know i'am over,over,over confident but what the heck...i dont think that all those creepy fools from the other class can do anything like the Indian Nation Congress did but insteads i can suggest them to shove their asses up their faces so that they ca avoid the humiliation.                   THE FELLA I FIND MOST IRRITATING deviating slightly from the election scenario i would like to write about on fucked up useless bastard in the name of raghuram...a student from F2 and who does he think he is? Heidi Klum or Madonna??????? He triens to sing buts ends up braying and cheats on you over money tries to walk like a supermodel and let me remind all you fellows reading this that the fella weighs over 200 pounds and is 8cms atleast shorter than me.....he looks sick..acts even more sicker and is a jolllu party of the first order becos he thinks he is mr.hot...mr.sexy and the ultimate mr.cool.....comon , how many people can this guy try to impress,impersonate,and fail in both miserably....ok i'm so angry that for the first time in this blog's long and memorable 2 day history i am gonna use the word.....f*c* this raghuram t hell......somebody please kick his ass so hard that it comes out through his over sized belly...... Ok well thats all for now Hope u liked reading sorry for not witing philosopphy of the day yesterday Philosophy of the day for today:"Try To Live And Dont Try To    Exist" Oke G2g(i ment gotta go) bye  santhosh kumar lg Hello People....Time To Say Good Bye
