Maybe all of those "Friday the 13th" movies destroyed my confidence in the counselors' ability to save me from ax wielding maniacs, but I just never liked camp much as a kid. I was forced to go, and I never grew to love it like some kids did.  As a teen, my opinion didn't change much. The teens I saw going to work at camp weren't my cup of tea. They were those embarrassing christians that we all know. The ones who wear "Jesus is my homeboy" tee-shirts!?! Or listen to the musical styling of Carmen and his other river dancing companions.  Maybe I didn't like camp because of the whole "meat market" scene. Counselors hired to minister to kids were too busy trying to "hook-up" with other staff to realize the opportunity they had to influence lives. Or, in the case of "Friday the 13th", to save lives from a hockey mask wearing psycho.  ...I'm beginning to think my whole theory on camp was based on those cheap 80's horror movies...  But I was pleasantly surprised over this last weekend. There were a couple "Jesus is my homeboy" tee-shirts floating around, but I avoided those people like the plague. I didn't want any of their corniness to rub off on me! Other than that, the staff was amazing. The counselors were focused on their kids. There were the inevitable "hook-ups", but they weren't the focus of the activities on camp.  I was amazed at the willingness of the staff to help with our program (I.F. and Lamont lead, and I provided the muscle). The staff seemed really interested in spiritual matters and we ended up ministering to one another.  Camp wasn't a show. It wasn't perfectly pre-planned, it didn't have all the bells and whistles that money could buy, but it was real. And I think the kids understood that. Kids are a lot more perceptive than we give them credit for. They can tell phony! And they respect when you're yourself. We didn't speak down to them, and they responded.  I was amazed at the response to the altar call. I wasn't expecting it. One minute I closed my eyes to pray, the next, I opened them and saw half the seats empty. The altar was completely full. I just sat their dumbfounded.  And that's the part of camp that I love. The amazing effect it can have on a life. And the way that God can work through us to do amazing things.  So the eternal debate will go on, "To camp or not to camp". But this last weekend has certainly tipped the scales toward the pro-camp side.
