Andrea enjoys flirting with me. I know it, she does it, and every once in a while I flirt back. It happens. But, mostly, now that I have realized how much trouble she is, it has become easier to just ignore these nudges she gives me towards flirting. More like flirting with disaster. A long time ago, in a land far far away, I found out that Andrea is trouble if you ever try to go any further than being a friend with her. She can be a nice person, but she can be very mean and very nasty when she wants to be. In being a male friend with her (for over a year now) I have found out a few things. For a successful relationship with Andrea as a friend, you have to walk a fine line between being too kind and too mean. I, obviously, have never found that line. I have found both sides of the line, though. In being too kind, she eventually wants to make something more of the relationship, even if she has already a very viable and useful, not to mention sound, romantic relationship already. I have also found that side of being too mean. In doing that, she becomes this hostile creature ready to bite your head off, and depending on the unkindness you displayed, she can come to terms with you and be nice to you in as little as three days or as much as three weeks. This period of unkindness usually occurs after a short time of being too nice, which usually leads into a small period of being mean to each other, which leads into the said three day to three week period of her being angry and hostile towards me, which then continues the circle back into the time of being too kind. I am still trying to find that fine line of being kind, but not inviting, or breaking the circle. Either way, I am getting this down to a science. Soon I will begin selling books on how to be a good friend towards Andrea. This has been a Discovery Channel Documentary On Andrea. Hope you have enjoyed the show. (lights up)  She wanted me to do a sort of comparison test between her and Andi. Unfortunatly, our comparison test servers and algorithms have been down for quite some time now, and are not planned to have up in running for a few months. I am sorry for the inconvenience. What I can provide instead, though, is a look into why I don't want a romantic relationship with either. Andi is a very kind person, and I have always thought the best of her. But, she is not deep enough for me, she seems to bring up the same points in conversation, not to mention she lives in a dream world where she can go out with a 19 year old and get away with it. Not to mention, she beleives her life will be led out in a series of events that are planned and will happen, no matter what. Like I said, great person, but I see problems with relationships on the horizon.  Andrea, on the other hand, is perhaps too deep. Although I have figured out our relationship cycles to a T, she always has her suprises. I dislike the way she seems to want everything, and I hope she realizes she can't have everything. For one door to open, another door must close. I have found that to be pretty true in life. There are many reasons why I will not and cannot date either of these girls without having brain surgery done, or on the effect of drugs, or without realizing I most likely will be the most miserable person on the planet. I am sure both of them will find the perfect guy to make them happy. Maybe they already have. I just know I won't make them happy, either one of them. But I wish them the best. Now I'm going to bed... Cue that time when Andrea won't speak to me...this might be a three-weeker, guys. Lol.
