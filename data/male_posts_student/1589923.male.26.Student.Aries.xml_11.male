Not exactly sure if it is a good place to study but then again, i'm sure there are more activities going in this cosmopolitan city yah. lastly, been eating so much today. unbelievable. i'm amazed with her appeitite. the servings here are tremendously huge. i have a feeling it could actually feed a cow. oh well, guess, there's just so much i could stuff myself. couldn't even finished my dinner. it was a turn off when i saw my food. natural body reaction i suppose. so much for sydney now... looking forward to orientation next week.
