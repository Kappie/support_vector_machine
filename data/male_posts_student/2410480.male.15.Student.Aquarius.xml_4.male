We need more volunteers to spread GNU amoong India: where one-sixth of the world population resides   So let us all join for the cause of FOSS (Free and Open Software for the unintiated). Buzz me @ ankitmalik@gmail.com if you are interested.   For those who aren't aware: here is what SFD is all about:     "On August 28, 2004, we will celebrate the first annual Software  Freedom Day. On that day, we will make the world aware of the virtues  of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), and encourage its widespread  use. We will set up stations in public places to give away  informational fliers and CDs with selected FOSS, including TheOpenCD   and a Linux Live CD.This is a global grassroots marketing campaign in  which we are inviting volunteers from around the world to participate."
