Of course, after the last couple of days I probably needed to sleep in ;)  Speaking of which, went to the Cavs game last night...of course, Jay and I were a little late in picking everyone up because we had to try to beat Gollum on LOTR-ROTK (for PS2).  Anyway, we get to the meeting place and we end up with 11 people (I only really planned on 6 or 7), so we ended up having to squeeze 3 people (and I mean SQUEEZE) into my car (fortunately the person in the back was Danny, my brother, so I didn't feel too bad for him :P).  So anyway...we left a little late so I had to drive kinda fast, but Jay kept up (he was in Andy's van, which was about bottomed out because it had 8 people in it).  Unfortunately we got separated getting off the highway, so we ended up parking at different places (I paid $5, he paid $15 :P).  So Dan, Danielle, and I get to the ticket counter first and find out that the $10 tickets we planned on buying are sold out - big problem inasmuch as some of us don't exactly have a lot of extra money right now!  So we wait for everyone, powwow outside the Gund, and finally decide to pay the extra 10 bucks and go to the game (some of the folks with us were under 18, so that kinda killed the option of goin out to a lot of the places in Cleveland we were thinking of).  So we run in to buy the tickets and find out that we have to buy them all at once (i.e. on one card, etc.) or else we probably won't get seats together.  Needless to say, $220 later on my debit card we're all sitting together (and I have a wallet-full of cash, something I was a little uncomfortable with).  So we finally get in line to get in (which entails going back OUTSIDE) and wait around for about 20 minutes or so.  They do security checks on everyone, although I could think of a million simple ways to get stuff by them if I had to (I just do stuff like that...it doesn't make me a terrorist!).  So guess who gets busted as a "security threat?"  Yep, yours truly.  The police officer wasn't too amused with the Swiss Army knife I keep on my keychain, so I had to "dispose" of it (I believe his exact words were "throw it away - and not in here").  Being the cheapskate that I am and it being a perfectly good Swiss Army knife, I couldn't bring myself to throw it away just so I could go to a basketball game.  Halfway to the trash can I notice the huge planters they have outside the Gund, so I just bury the "knife" along the side of one of them...fortunately, when I came back out after the game it was still there.  The game was ok - the Cavs were a little flat, it was the second day of the back-to-back.  But at least it was close throught virtually the entire game.  Katie kept telling us what it looked like from up close (she had been to a game earlier in the week where she was 4 rows behind the bench), but I was glad to be sitting next to her because then I got all the running basketball commentary (Her:  "Outlet to the side!....push to the post!...YOU IDIOT!!  HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?!"  Me:  "What'd he do?"  Her:  "Um...just a sec...WHAT?!  Did you see that?  The guy drove the post and didn't even see the guy WIDE OPEN on the wing..." (sad shaking of head). Needless to say, I never got my explanation :P).  Oh, and remember our $5 parking space?  One extra bonus was that we got in and out of it REAL quick (basically get in the car and drive out).  Remember Jay's $15 space?  We were halfway home on 480 when he calls me hysterically exclaiming "We've moved!  Five whole feet!"  Yeah...we were home about 45 minutes before them. :)  But of course this being break and having a bunch of people with us, we couldn't just settle for doin the game.  Nope, I have to invite everyone over for pizza and a movie (of course, I was probably gonna watch the movie on my own anyway, so why not have some people over?).  A half hour and two Papa Johns pizzas later, everyone's here and Bad Boys 2 is in the DVD player (by now it's about 11:00 or so).  Bad Boys 2 is definitely one of my new favorite movies just because it's one of those movies that doesn't really ever stop and you don't really have to think about anything...basically it goes from things getting shot and blown up to comedic interludes to things getting shot and blown up again. :)  Kinda reminds me of Gone in 60 Seconds without the sweet cars or a bleach-blond Angelina Jolie.  Some observations from last night: - Your gear ratios really DO change when you load down your car...and with the engine my car has, it doesn't take much to load it down :P - It's so weird to see people in high school dating.  Not that it's a whole lot different than people in college, but still...maybe I'm just getting hung up on the age.  Or maybe I'm just jealous...:P - I miss my CD-played in my car...I need to switch it out ASAP.
