It is back to work for me after quite a long break. Only now I work half days for I have taken half day leave for the next two weeks. This is to allow me to study in the afternoons, and looking at how much time I have left I really need to make full use of that time. However I find myself easily distracted, more so than when I was in Poly. Hoping that it just takes awhile for me to get my studying engine back up to speed.  Another important update is that the Home cell group that is meeting at my physical lair (i.e. Home) has begun. It is good to have people around, to sit around and chat in a comfortable setting, to share and study the Bible. Most of the members are younger than me, but nevertheless it is entertaining to listen to them and be there for them if need be. Of course   Edwin   is always the life of the party, with him sharing with us his jokes and stories. He always has this way of getting everyone to unwind and open up. So anyway we meet up on Friday nights at my house. Anyone interested for more details, feel free to drop me aline.  Lastly, here are some plans that I have for the blog coming up this month. I'm planning to get a Links section up on the sidebar, keep a look out for that. And I am still working on that article about the programs and how I use my Palm PDA, for those new palm users who would like some tips, now that they actually own one.  Here I go, back to the grindstone again. Take care and stay sharp.
