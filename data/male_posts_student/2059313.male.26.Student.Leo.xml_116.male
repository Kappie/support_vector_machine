       
      Tonight, for the first time, I cried with my friend.  Not about her, or for her, or around her... but with her.  I've always felt like I had to stay strong for people, but tonight in the midst of prayer and seeing and hearing her cry, I bawled my eyes out.  I felt very clensed afterwards, and a little foolish.  This isn't about me, and I felt like I needed support instead of being support.  When I got into my car on the way home, I drove in the rain, but of course no one else was getting wet, just me... my eyes were pouring.
