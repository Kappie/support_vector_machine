I did absolutely nothing today, after I woke up at 2:30 p.m. A.J was suppose to come over and bring weed but he never got some from his guy. So I sat around all day and then I went to Harrison's friend's house for an hour to play risk. I was going to win, but I left early with the excuse that I needed to go to a jazz festival with my family.  Tomorrow could be a good day. I'm probably going to read the driver handbook again. Andrew might come over. I might get stoned. I might get a call from Earl Bales. Here's to hoping.
