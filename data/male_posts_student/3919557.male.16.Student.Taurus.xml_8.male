We had our F.O.Rs the past two days.  It is when our owners and supervisors come in and watch us the whole day.  They also time our service. We did really good though.  We scored high 90's in everything.   The rest of my day  I was usually hanging out with Sarah's family at the beach.  It was fun.  Her family is so nice.  We went swimming a lot and played pit and dutch blitz.  We had a good time, they left this morning.   Last night we had our jazz band concert.  It went extremely well.  Everyone said we played awesome.  My mom said she had never enjoyed listening to us more.  It was cool.  I played the best I have played in Jazz Band this summer.  Well thats about all I have been up too.  I am going to go to bed because I have to get up at 7 to get ready for our jazz band concert tommorow.
