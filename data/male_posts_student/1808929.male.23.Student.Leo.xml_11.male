I'm done with my cellular science section of medical school and my first round of practical exams. I think it went well for the most part. Gross anatomy and musculoskeletal science starts next week. ["Go Your Own Way," Fleetwood Mac, 1977]  What am I going to do with my 3-day weekend? Tomorrow I am planning on watching the 10th anniversary show of Conan O'Brian and probably some movie also with Melanie, Omar, and perhaps Juls. Saturday I'm going to the Fort Worth jazz festival and that evening I'll be going home to celebrate my grandpa's 80th birthday. Papa is now among those people whom public health professionals call among the "oldest-old". He's still doing pretty well healthwise. ["I Drove All Night," Celine Dion, 2003]  Kelli Modlin, one of my friends here at UNTHSC was in a car accident this afternoon. I think she'll be ok, but her car was pretty totaled. Melanie, Juls, Omar and I went to see her in the ER this afternoon. I got to talking to Melanie afterward about how odd this day was. First the weather was f*cked up royally today (alternating sunny and rainy patterns all through the day). Second....well I don't know how else the day was f*cked, but it just was, I'm not here to figure it out. Maybe Isabel pulled some air pressure shit on us here in Texas. Anyway, I get so pissed and uptight about stupid crap all the time. Seeing Kelli in the hospital today really reinforced to me that I'm really wrapped up in unimportant crap.  ["Who'll Stop the Rain," Credence Clearwater Revival, 1976]  Ok, so now for more unimportant crap. It's now been 2 years and 2 months since I've dated anyone. I've gotta start looking in the public health school or the nursing school. This is rediculous, the best years of my prime are just going to waste. I'm just sick of this crap...what's it going to take for me to get out there again and take a chance? Well, I'm tired now, so I'll see y'all later. ["Whiskey Bottle," Uncle Tupelo, 1990]    Recommended song: Wilco, "Kamera" 2002.
