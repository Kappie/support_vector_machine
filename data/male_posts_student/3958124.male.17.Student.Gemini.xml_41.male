I hadn't truly gone anywhere since dropping Kevin, Noah, and Siping off on Saturday. That party was the shizz man. So Noah comes over and Travis is "busy" with ykw. To make up for Travis's absence, Kevin and Siping come over  with  the  PS2 . Pizza was had, along with brownies (Trav, you missed out, they were  delicious ) and DDR was played.  If you want to see something funny, come over and watch Noah play DDR. Or better yet, my brother Will. They looked like  urlLink this . Just kidding. Siping has added new words to the list that previously included words like people, animal, etc. The list now includes single and double. These were discovered when playing DDR. Siping began announcing the arrows coming up. It was so funny, I got an  E  because I was laughing so hard.  Back to the events of yesterday. I didn't really plan on doing anything, but out of the blue, Magni called me and we decided to go to the square. I gave Travis a call and he decided to go as well. Jeremy Ma gave us a ride, on the condition that he would get to look at hotel prices for his... sister... ehem.  John Penny and the Tate-meister himself called and they met up with us in the squizzle. We ate way too much pinocchio's pizza. I went and got a CD from this Chicago based musicain,  urlLink TRS-80 . Bought way too much Japanese candy. Then we hopped into John's whale of a Chrysler and rolled home to some funky bass beats.   Less interesting stuff, sooner.
