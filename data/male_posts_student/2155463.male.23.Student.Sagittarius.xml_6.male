Yeah, well, that was yesterday...and I got to listen to the sermon 4 times (I was doin video) :-P  If you want to hear the sermon, go here (http://www.hudsonchapel.org - go to the "Resources" link, then the "Sermons" link - it was the sermon on 10/26).  Joe (our pastor) had just gotten back from India, and he was sharing about his experiences while there.  He was traveling with a medical missions team, but the Indian group there were working with had tried a novel idea in reaching the Indians with the love of Christ.  Basically, instead of going in to "convert" people from the "Hindu team" to the "Christian team," they simply go in and love people, and in doing so truly express the love of Christ that makes Him so appealing, holy, etc.  In my opinion, they strip Christianity of all its pomp and circumstance and get down to the heart of the matter - that God loves people, and that we are still  here for that very reason (i.e. to love people as God loves them).  Joe also shared about how India recently instituted a "non-conversion" law - basically, it's illegal to convert people to Christianity.  And then he shared how the work of the Christians there is so powerful, that what they do is so good for the community, that the people just aren't willing to turn them in.  After one church service the "head man" of a region (a Hindu) stood up after the service and actually told people to come to church because of what the Christians had been doing there!  One thing that really struck Joe (and I) was what his interpreter told him while they were going through a village:  "The people of this village will not say anything bad about Christians because of what we have done here."  And these people aren't highly educated (or even highly literate, for that matter), and yet God is using them so powerfully simply because they have allowed themselves to become vessles of love, not of knowledge or reason or economy.  And the point of it all was that even when the doors seem closed, when they say you can't witness in the schools, or at work, or wherever, that doesn't mean that the doors are closed - it simply means that you have to be SO GOOD at what you do and how you treat people that they don't want to "turn you in."  And relatedly, if they do, what's more important to you?  Who or what is your high commander?  And of course, this all got me thinking about me.  In many ways, the challenge to love people is difficult for me; I feel like I hardly even know what that means, and I have even less idea about how to do it.  Maybe that's because I'm still trying to come to grips with what it's going to take to go all-in as a Christians, not as a devotion to a moral code or a set of "good ideas," but a relationship that permeates ALL areas of my life.  And I just feel that this isn't the case right now...I still struggle with living how I know I should because of what the "consequences" might be, of saying what I know to be true because I'm afraid it will offend someone.  Ironically enough, I think that being a Christian sometimes requires being irreverent...of ignoring the societal norms and conditions and simply getting to the real basics of life.  I was thinking about it, and do you have any idea how much of an impact we could have if all of the Christians in this nation actually lived with a consuming Christianity?  If we all got over our inhereted American ego-centrism and looked out for other people with the love that Christ has for us?  If we all were SO GOOD at our jobs that they couldn't imagine having someone else do them (and that doesn't mean that you have to be the most capable or the most intelligent - but in many ways, simply that you have the most care and work the hardest)?  I have to admit, I think that might be one of the greatest challenges I've ever heard in my life.  I was reading a book the other day (I think it was Wild at Heart) and I read the quote "men must either be challenged or entertained."  And how true is this!  How few of us feel challenged or challenge others?  Not I.  Thus, we seek entertainment - how often do we feel empty, useless, because we have spent all morning/day/evening doing nothing but ingesting what we know has no lasting value?  If Christians spent as much time reading the Bible and studying as they do watching TV...well, you get the idea.  This is probably a more critical and introspective posting than I originally intended, but I hope y'all get what I'm saying.  Christ has a love that transcends all positions and peoples, which is meant for every person.  And He has entrusted the ability to share that love with us - beauty can be demonstrated in nature, power and majesty in the cosmos, tranquility in stillness, but love can only be demonstrated through the willful interpersonal contact.  How I pray that we may all be able to grasp what His love is like and set our eyes upon Him in a more and more personal way, faithfully letting Him guide our paths and our actions.
