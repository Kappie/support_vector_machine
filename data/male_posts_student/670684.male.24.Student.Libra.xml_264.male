It's something I always wanted to do, and something I'm embarassed I never got around to.  I still have my last KSCL playlist...my last show was a dedication to all of my friends, and I gave most of the important people from Centenary a song (Corey McMullin and others were left out just because I couldn't figure out what song)...the plan was to take the show, burn it onto CD, and give a copy to every person I gave a song to, along with an explaination of why I chose every song...the best tribute I could think of.  When I first moved to Austin, I got to work on it via Kazaa and Morpheus, but my exeuberence was easily quelled due to the lack of originality on P2P networks...no one had Briar's  La Bamba .  And now I wonder if it's just too late.  There's a soundtrack to this summer.  Not so much in songs that lyrically tell the story of my conscience...more about the songs I've heard this summer that resonated with me...so yes, Matchbox 20, Avril Lavigne, and only two 80s songs so far (Blondie's ATOMIC and The Commodores' NIGHT SHIFT).  When the tour ends, I'll sell paraphanelia.    It's not flowing.  I'm fighting the words.  I don't know if it's obvious in the reading, but it pains me to write and read over and see the folly and erase and finally just leave something up there because, fuck, I need to write something and it's the best of the lot.  It's not block...the time to reflect is less than plentiful.    I asked Nola a question when I saw her...we were talking about careers and her as a doctor and me as a writer, and I asked her how she categorized me when she mentioned me to others.  She said  A writer, of course.   It was only interesting because Nola had never read any of my work.  Few people at Centenary had.  My Centenary writing career consisted of Fall my Sophomore year, where I took a creative writing class and produced half a dozen quality works, and summer before junior year, when I wrote a short stage play for our Orientation group dealing with the issues of college life.  Every once in a while I'd dick around with an idea, but things never got anywhere.  I wrote  urlLink Clubbing  on a May 2000 afternoon at a Starbucks in the Inwood Shopping Center, finishing the rough draft in 40 mintues and the polish an hour later.  It was okay...worth making, but not really worth seeing.    The writing didn't matter at Centenary, because I had so much more to do.   There will be time to write  I always said,  but when will there be time for this?   So I lived, and got out, and started writing.  And I learned how to be alone, how to value the hours of the day where I could sit down and lose myself in my mind and create fantasy onto a page to such a degree that people would fall in love with my characters, want my characters to be alive, and hurt when they suffered.    I'm back in the Centenary mode right now...fast life, little time for introspection.  The mind is constantly moving, but I don't have the time to let it create.
