In my culture, as a Mexican, the women have a certain tradition, or party rather, called a quinceneara. This is a tradition where a young girl has entered her mature stage and transforms into a young lady. The word quince means 15, so this also can be called a 15 to many other people. Every so often, there is a cross over where the young boy changes to a man and is still labeled as a 15 as well. The party will consist of presents, a dance, and an ever so popular toast to young woman. There is also another form of ritual that is becoming very popular called the "Running of The Bulls." This is where many men run away from wild, untamed bulls. This is very dangerous, but the adrenaline rush is what you can't fight. People travel from all over the world to see this event. In the years, you have also seen woman in the run as well. So you see where the cross over is in this tradition.
