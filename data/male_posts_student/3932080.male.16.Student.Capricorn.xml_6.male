Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Confessions Part II -Usher Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #1 What the hell happened to  Mario Winans’  fine logic? Earlier this year, he and  P. Diddy  dropped “I Don’t Wanna Know,” a perfectly lovesick jam that idealized adultery;  Winans  begged not to be told about his significant other’s wanderings astray, citing as reason the fact that “[his] heart [couldn’t] take it anymore.” Then along came  Usher  midway through the summer, completely ignoring  Winans  by diarizing his infidelity and preaching it in song form to his girlfriend.  Usher’s  reason? His “chick on the side” is three months pregnant, and she’s keeping it. Rambling on through some up-step piano chords and a looped synth line, Usher picked one of the less interesting tracks from  Confessions  as a third single just because he wanted the whole world to know. Sure, it hit #1 on the  Billboard Hot 100 , but that’s just because Usher took the world by storm with “Yeah!” and “Burn,” making this track little more than a side dish (not unlike that mom-to-be mentioned throughout).  Mario Winans  didn’t want to know.  Usher  told all. If they were a couple, things could be getting really out of hand.    The Verdict:  5.0/10 - Brouhaha   (2.5/5)
