I think I was gonna call the story "The Devil You know" in reference to the phrase "The Devil you know is worse then the Devil you Don't" but alas fucking psat classes ruined that.  Why am I cursing so much? Maybe it's the stress of being herded into some stupid exploitive system, of giving a test that is more geared for people with money to succeed and most American colleges are based around.  It's the thing of the rich getting richer, and the poor getting poorer.  Filthy rich capitalist with their blood money.  Makes me sick.  If God Wills it (insha allah), so says the confused mystic (it's a Quaker word), maybe school will be flooded out tommorow although I doubt God has ever been quite so nice.  Except with Floyd, I would pray for it,  but I have objections with praying just like I have objections with swearing oaths. For example- If your praying that means you don't aknowledge your always in communication with God, similar to if your taking an oath, it says your not normally truthful.
