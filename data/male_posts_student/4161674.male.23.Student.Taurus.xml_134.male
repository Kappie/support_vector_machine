Laughter intrudes, sings too loud 	Shouting above the din of the crowd. Anguish alters realityâ€™s rhyme 	Setting everything off off time. Anxiousness distracts good intentions 	With flustered answers to too many questions. Ability can increase or decrease might, 	As commitments carry into the night. Hopes haunted, fears challenged, 	Everyone watching this seems to be astounded. Wandering worry, wished wane 	My crazy life that is happy, sad and SANE.
