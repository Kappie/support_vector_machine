I am making the trans-Utah and part of AZ trek with my boss' son, who is a sweet dude.  Also, I am going to a wine tasting tonight.  I am bringing a Christian fundamentalist, who went to a crazy fundamentalist college.  urlLink  .    Not good times, but I will tell the blog how both the date and the Vegas trip turned out on Monday.  Outs.
