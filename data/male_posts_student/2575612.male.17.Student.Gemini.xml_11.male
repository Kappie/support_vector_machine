Many turn to booze, drugs, and bad relationships to try to fill the immense void within their souls. Some turn to trying to be perfect, to gain wisdom and to educate themselves to their fullest extent. Some turn to religions that pound in rituals and policies so that they may spend eternity in heaven. While others decide that life is not worth living, friends are not worth meeting, animals are not worth holding, nature is not worth seeing. they kill themselves, to end their heartache and strife. the great irony. they kill themselves to get away from their own hell on earth, but then find hell. what is it that makes us tick? what is this life for? what are we to do with this short time given to us?  we learn and educate ourselves, work until we cant anymore then rest till our death comes. Is that the right way to live? what is inside of us that screams for more. to sail on the sea with the wind on our back yelling  this is it ! sitting quietly on the mountainside  listening to our echo from our soul  this is it!  And what about dangling your feet in the water while journaling your thoughts?  birds dart back and forth overhead,  while the way the trees bend and swing in the summer breeze.  Is this it?  What has happened that men dont expect more and more?   life as it is will fade the kingdoms crumbling, the plants wither, the great people die, life as it is will fade.  but as most sit and write depressing blogs like this, some get up put on their hiking boots and pack their gear. for they are to go search for the epic life and are insistent on finding it and drinking from it abundantly. the message is, if its hard for you to follow (which i dont doubt) that life will soon be drained from us. why not make a difference, why not seek for truth, and find it.
