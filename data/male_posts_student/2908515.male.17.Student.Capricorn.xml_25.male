It seems that his parents want to cancel the Philadelphia date/trip.  For a surprise party.  I was a little crushed by that.  But I guess it'll do Matt some good.  Since a lot of people will be coming.  They, of course, invited me to that.  And at first, I didn't really want to go.  Since it'll be meeting new people and I have had enough new people for the week.  I didn't feel like looking my best for any new people.  But I think Matt would like it very much if I came.    Of course, I can't tell him.  Or ask him if I could/should come.  Well, whatever.  Today, when I was driving, his mom called my cellphone and said that I should call him to reschedule the Philadelphia trip to another time so that he doesn't suspect anything.  I mean, it would be pretty bad if I just told him I couldn't go or something.  Maybe he could read me.  And I guess it'll be better if I stayed out of his way for sometime?  I don't know.  11:15 AM, Oaks Movie Theater, I should be there so Erika, Matt's sister, could pick me up.  Saturday.  Matt's house.  Surprise!
