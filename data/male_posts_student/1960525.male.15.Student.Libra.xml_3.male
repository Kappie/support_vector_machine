Michelle has a plan on what to do, and if she works it out, then i want to go as well, but we will see.  umm.... band is sucking, we have a concert next tuesday, and we are doing to much stuff, my face is going to get so out of shape this summer.... we dont have a summer thing cause we dont have a marching band caues we are to lame.  i would so like to try and set somthing deffinate with Michelle at church tomorrow, like a real date where we can meet and go out, but go out on a date... i think that was the sencario..... so long ago, i dont remember.  well, sleep now, so im just gonna stop typing and go and sleep because i have to get up early tomorrow to go to a breakfast meeting with our intern minister to dicuss her expections for the credo service, it would probably help if i were to stop typing......... maybe, ok, bed bugs, bye... no for real, im stoping..... i am, there is nothing left to read, im stoping....... fine keep reading, see if i care!  i do, please always read my blog.
