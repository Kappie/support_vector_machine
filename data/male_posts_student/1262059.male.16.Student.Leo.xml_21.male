I'm weaker than you and I'm not tired from it. Hehe, as for that test... I think I'm going to fail it...didn't practice the reversal and couldn't perfect the scarf-hold...   Ah... history project... need... to...finish... tired...want...sleep...but...CAN'T!...    ~Chronos...till the end of Time   *later in the night... or early in the morning*   ok...it's like 2:45am... but at least I'm done! Yay! *collapse*   ~Chronos...till the end of Time   *5-10 min later*   Woot! Staying up this early was all worth it! I'm one of the first people to read the new Megatokyo comic for this Friday! Ahh... finished listening to Invoke for like the 20th time... found that it was one of the few songs that can keep me energetic in such a desperate time... hehehehe... too tired to get high though... *flops*   Don't get me wrong though... I like "Invoke"... but I still like "Northern Lights" the most! "Do You Be-Li-Eve In Des-Ti-Ny?!"   Now off to bed I go before my parents wake up and kill me... ^-^;;;   ~Chronos...till the end of Time
