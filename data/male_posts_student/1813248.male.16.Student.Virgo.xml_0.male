For instance, when I was going to work this morning I couldn't remember where I put my keys. I must have searched for 20 minutes before I realized they were hanging on the keyrack beside the door. I've been getting more aggitated...more jumpy.    Finally I get to finish this entry. Some asshole intern spilled coffee all over my shit and now I'm soaked..and pissed. Why does it always end up like this? Why is it that I'm always messed with? Why the hell won't PEOPLE JUST LET ME BE? DID I DO ANYTHING TO ANYBODY ELSE TO DESERVE THIS?
