She says "No, I'm not telling you who I like!!" with a big smile on her face.   She asks you who you like or who you would go out with seeming interested.   When you go to the movies with a bunch of your friends, she's almost always next to you.   She criticizes (put downs) the girl you like.   She knows your WHOLE family's names including your dog).   She knows stuff about you like your birthday, eye color, favorite color, screen name, favorite food, favorite band, what music you like and favorite sport.   Her friends outside of school know about you and say she talks of you a lot.   She knows your phone number and address.   She will try and talk and spend time with you as much as possible.
