See my grandma which is aging and do not have my whole life to see and see Corey's new house and yeah.  Just visit the people that I only see a couple times a year.  Just wish these damn trips didnt have to be back to back to back.  Really sucks...because since June 10th of this year I have spent a total of 8 days at home.  Date I get back from OK July 19th....HOLY SHIT!!!  I have been the real traveler this summer havent I?  I dont know...too much time with the family if you ask me.  At least it is over after this one...cant wait to be home for over a week at a time....and spend time consistently with Meeta....that would be great. So Colorado was a little eh.  When I wasnt worried and stuff I had a blast (no guilt trip)  Really got to know Albert a whole lot better and he really helped me through the week.  I mean backpacking was a blast...just had a lot on my mind, thats all.  Really none of anyones buisness (no offense) unless it has to do with you or I tell you so I wont mention what abouts I was worried about in here and who it pertains to.  But yeah didnt see a bear but wish I had.  Got some really nice pictures of the Rockies and yeah.  Frickin altitude kicked my ass though with all the hiking I did.  Oh well, and I also came back with a REALLY nice tan hahaha....I know sounds corny but I almost look Mexican, thats how dark I am.  Also saw a wild eagle 20 ft above my head...that was REALLY cool. So yeah I dunno, today was awesome.  I got my new hat.  Its a Mich State hat exactly like the old one cept a little bit darker and yeah...is actually much nicer than the old one.  It was a very belated b-day present of mine that I very much like.  Thank you so much Kait. =)  Yeah, the rest of the day was spent with Meeta. =)  Was really nice to see her again and when I say really that word is not enough.  Words can not express how much I missed her this past week and how GREAT it was to see her smilin, beautiful face.  Seein her really cleared a lot up and basically spent the entire afternoon and night with her.  Went and got ice cream, took a walk to the RR, came home and had a GREAT time at my house.  It was great, best night of the summer so far.  I cant explain how awesome I feel right now and how top-of-the-world I am feeling.  It is wonderful. =) So yeah will write tommorow and then I will prolly write will I am gone too cause I will have comp access and cell access for sure.  So yeah, Im out.  summer breeze...makes me feel fine....=)....
