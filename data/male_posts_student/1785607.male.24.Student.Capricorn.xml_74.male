I woke up early and did my Yoga routine then headed to school. At 11 in the morning I had nothing to do and was all around tired so when at home I slept. I had in mind just a few hours of sleep, I even adjusted the alarm to wake up and eat. I don't remember much, just killing the alarm and then going back to sleep. I woke up around 5 in the afternoon. Feeling a little odd, a little down, totally different as the way I have been feeling lately. Anyway, I got ready and all dressed up to go to school. I arrived, I had a class at 7 pm so I got there a little early, just ready to read some essays I had as a homework which I did not do early. I was alone in the classroom, the rest of my classmates were not there because they did not have the 5 to 7 class, so I sat there alone just reading. When class started and I was with my friends, not a joke, not a mumbled answer from one of the guys at the back to the teacher made me laugh. I was just  staring at the board. I was so sick with everyone's opinion on the topics. I concurred with some, other's I did not care for, specially the ones that got all philosophic when the answer was plain there, I mean, C'mon guys if the teach asks why the planets have a social impact on us, don't start with the ramifications of the way the human thinks and the abstract nature of human reasons to act... Just say:  at day we live, at night we sleep ... As simple as this... Latter we can have a philosophical debate about man... Ugh.. So tired of all that shit!  Well, finally, at the end of class I went down the stairs with Linda and Alejandra after, lets just say it, a FUNNY moment with Iv√°n, which was in the seat in front of me. So anyway, we were leaving school and we just say bye, not a conversation, not a thing. So as I started strolling down the street, 'cause I park my car outside school grounds so I can take a walk everyday, I just ...When I realized were I was, and what time it was, I just could not believe it. I did not know how I got there, why I was there and most of all, why I did feel so good about it, it came natural to me. I was about 3 minutes from el Centro, CA. I crossed the border and have been driving for about 20 minutes when I notice what I was doing; and we all know why I was doing it. I got there and turned back. Depression. But it was sweet and all musical. I came back sad and misty eyed but singin' with all my heart and lungs. Life! We're not only wired to want what we can't have, but we're wired to want what we don't want. I just wish someone could say to him: " Bring our boy " ... Ah Carrie Bradshaw, how lucky you are!
