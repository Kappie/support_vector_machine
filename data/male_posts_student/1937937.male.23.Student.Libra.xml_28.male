Needless to say, when we got her to the vet, she was not happy.  The vet took a quick look at her and suggested that we leave her overnight -- for the nominal fee of $598.75.  This was not cool, but he was suggesting that we'd do it if it was our child, so we should do it for the cat.  And I guess we agreed, because we left her there.  It was most likely for the best: it was clear that the cat was not well.   This morning, Carissa went by at around 7 and picked her up.  I got up and took her to our vet, and he checked her out for feline AIDS and this other disease called FIP.  It was scary for a few moments, because the paper that the emergency vet gave us said "differential diagnosis: ... FIP".  I asked the vet what FIP was, and he said it was a fatal disease; so for a little while, I thought that Duchess was going to die.  Fortunately, that turned out to mean "possible" diagnosis -- and she came back negative for anything  really  serious, although she does have pneumonia.  I don't know why I feel so crappy, really, because this is good news.  Brad is also calling me about getting a place -- I told him I really was only interested in The Mark, but I don't know, something in my gut is just a little twisted.  And then, by the grace of God (BYGG), Bob W called and asked if I wanted to hang out with him at the Biltmore tomorrow.  Of course, I want to hang out at the Biltmore, and I'd hang out with Bob even if it was at the barber shop.  He said that I seemed to be going through a "transition" phase; I don't know what that means, I like to interpret it to mean "growing up", but that doesn't seem likely.  I'm afraid of speaking at a meeting right now, and that really bothers me.  It's not that normal jittery feeling -- last night, I was working the bar, and I realized that at some point I might have to do the announcements, and this made me run cold with fear.  This is very strange, because I've come to  enjoy  doing the announcements.  So, you say, a Blog about "his life" doesn't really get him out of himself?  Well, there's got to be something that can be done about that!  What should I turn this in to?  I enjoy spewing, and I like posting pictures -- there must be some positive, productive outlet in all of this.
