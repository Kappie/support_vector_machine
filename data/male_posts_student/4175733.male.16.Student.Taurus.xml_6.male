That’s the first thing I think about.  The second thing I think is how fortunate it is of a thing that she started braking down, almost on que. This stalls the envoy of salvation that’s been traveling around the conference room for the last half hour. We’re almost at forty-five minutes, which is spilt time.  There is the clergy, marching around the room to different tables. Shining Christ’s love onto each and every believer. Saving each soul, one at a time. Everyone’s got their pasty yellow tickets into heaven with an expected ten-minute wait.  Oh yeah, welcome to Camp Salvation. This is where the gentiles convert the heathens. There is absolute nothing to fear here except for the fact that about two or three hundred bible thumpers are ready to pound my sinful ass.  I spot Dylan in the corner of my eye, and he gives me this look that says, “SOS.” He doesn’t look angry or impatient. Dylan is more human then ever here. He is scared. He is scared shitless and so am I.  The shameful girl full of mascara and woe, they have her on her knees now. I move a couple images around in my head, except for her body position. This is that part where the cameraman is supposed to get a close up of your shoulders with the two creatures chilling up top objectively pointing out each aspect of the problem. I hold my breathe and try to listen to what my mind thinks I should do, but all I can think about is that purple… crimson color those girls knees are right now, and how awesome they would look on my hardwood floor.  I’m evil and I can deal with that. I wouldn’t label Dylan and I evil, but we are sinners. We had talked about this last night. Last night with the blanket of stars and the cold mountain air. Jesus, I had said, I love it up here. The whole human thing, I also commented, the whole brainwashing salvation deal that they’ve got going on kind of thins the beauty of everything. Dylan looks at the hole in his beer and swishes it around a bit before saying, “That’s what’s the beer is for man, helps you un-think all the worldly possessions we are supposed to be attached to. All those neural synapses and endorphins we call feelings are just… complications if you ask me.”  I’m not asking you Dylan.  Christ, how did we get here?  “Careful, Dylan tells me, the mountain has ears.”  And we laugh, together, for what seems like a long time.  I take another sip of the beer, and say “Whatever, man.”  The girl went away to wash off her shame by now. By the time I snap out of my little stupor of a hallucination because nobody has slept this whole week, everyone is looking at me. Everyone has their hands folded, like they are about receive an axe to the neck. And me, I spaced out again. They ask me if I’ve accepted Christ as my personal savoir. And I feel a hand tug on my arm. Smooth, delicate, features that remind me why I’m here. Alison. That stupid little cunt-bag that teased me into deliverance. Alison. I had tried to bang her last night. She whined about abstinence and forgiveness and Africa missionary work… stuff that reminded me of different drugs and sexual positions.   Dylan with his half-empty beer and his big red sweatshirt… he tells me that if they get to him, and they try to convert him, he wants me to pull the plug. I ask what he means by “pull the plug.” Dylan tells me to run into the basement of the meeting hall where they hold the inquisitions, and flip the circuit breaker. I tell him that they won’t like it, and he gives me a spot to meet him at after the blackout.  We’re so tired and a little drunk that running away from a christen teen concentration camp seems like the perfect solution to get back home as soon as possible to avoid Christ’s forgiveness and play some video games.  Dylan opening another beer looks at the stars and tells me that it’s just plain old selfish. That we sacrifice our entire lives for some… phantom that was more then likely cobbled together from the backs of biblical cereal boxes. “We sacrifice more than our dedication and time, Dylan tells me, we sacrifice our ideals and morals for the church’s.”  I take another sip of the beer, and say “Whatever, man.”  I clench Alison’s open palm and put on this look that says, “Help me help myself.” Looking right into the guys face, I tell him that I have yet to wield the power of Christ’s all-forgiving love. I get the reaction I’m looking for. I tell them I’m ready to pull the plug on Satan and his filthily habits.   I notice Dylan excuse himself on the word “pull.” The hard-on I was feeding off of Alison quickly shoots back down into my pants because my Adrenal glands have just licked their lips and they are ready to blow.  I can hear Dylan in the back of my head, ranting as usual. Dylan tells me that he never wants to be saved. Salvation, he says, shouldn’t have to be a goddamn obligation. Dylan on his fifth or sixth beer tells me that without sin, what would we have? Dylan shifts his weight and almost stumbles, but manages to get out the word “…nothing.” Sin is the fuel of our species, Dylan tells me. If we don’t break a few rules and conquer a little vagina here and there, we wouldn’t have any need for law or the military or even school. Without wrong doing we can never be caught. Without wrongdoing we are all the same generic cola in nonbiodegradable cups. We need to fuck stuff up once in a while to keep the earth spinning.”  “Would you say this night was uneventful, my friend?”  I don’t know Dylan, I’m drunk and I want to get some rest.  “Answer the fucking question, man. Have we done anything interesting tonight?”  No, Dylan, we haven’t.  “BUT… but, have we done anything wrong?”  No, Dylan, we follow the rules and nobody gets hurt.  “Well fuck them, I say we make this night memorable. I say we keep the earth spinning.”  I ask Dylan what he’s talking about.  “This.”  Just like that he polishes off his beer, and chucks the bottle into a fucking window down the row of generic blue housing. I jump and pull up the hood on my sweatshirt. I’m already reacting. I don’t think, I do. It feels kind of… good. I start to toss our bottles around, but Dylan grabs the last one, and tells me to throw it. “Sin already, they’re going to be pissed off when they find out we’re hurling shit.”   Dylan with his drunken smile, and his candy-ass hairstyle, I want to put a .50 in his forehead. I just start to jog away, but Dylan won’t leave. He just stands there, tossing the bottle up and down in the palm of his hand like a baseball. “Don’t tell me your brother-in-law is an angel or something and will know that we did this.”   No excuses. No distractions. I’m at the precipice of enlightenment.  I grab the bottle out of his hand, and say “Whatever, man.”  I chuck it, and I hear it smash, and it feels good.  I can feel the neural synapse. I can feel the peptide phenylthylamine rush into my blood stream. For a second, we aren’t thinking. We’re just doing.  All of this… these memory replays, are just the background static of my brain. My cortex and cerebrum are off somewhere, and it feels like my stem is the only part actually interacting with the rest of the real world.   I’m on my knees now. I look up and the inquisition has me caged in. They’ve formed a circle around me. Alison and I are the only ones in the circle, and she puts her warm, curved palm on the side of my face, and rubs it.   I’d smile but my cerebrum says, “You’re scared right now.” I am.  Here we are, Alison and I. What I’ve dreamt of for months. She’s the queen and I’m her knight. Flash back a few hundred years and this would seem all too familiar, but it doesn’t. Me with my eccentric layers of faith and body armor, it’s actually a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt that has a drawing of a sponge. All of that doesn’t matter though.  I part my arms, holding the warmth of the bright ceiling lights. I whisper, “Save me.” The circle closes a little, and the lights dim. The warmth fleets a little. Alison’s grip on my face tightens.  I clench the muscles in my face, and when some of the skin overlaps, I think of those old sailors with their wind-hardened faces that remind of you of stretched leather on a jacket or on a steering wheel or those eighty year old Indian medicine men. I berate in deep. I inhale. I gasp out the words, “Save me.” I can sense the circle’s feet touching mine. Alison brings my face to her belly because she thinks I might cry. I might have. I don’t know, nobody had gotten any sleep that weekend and nothing makes sense at a point.  I start to chant it like a song. “Save Me.” Save me from sin and a life that I’m doomed to fail at anyway. Save me from bad grades and satanic atheist teachers. Deliver me, if you will, from Swedish death metal and Junior Prom. Rip me out of my comfortable lifestyle to replace it with a sense of substance. SAVE ME, ALREADY. The circle closes tightly and I’m pushed into Alison’s abdomen. I wrap my arms around her body, and the first thing that I can think of is what I would do to her if I wasn’t getting delivered from sin. She buys into all of it. I think I am too. Getting on her knees and wrapping her arms around my head, she tells me everything is OK, and not to worry about anything.  I meet her gaze, and she tries to let go, but I’m holding her too tightly. Alison knows that look I’m giving her. That look that people have before the roller coaster goes down that first hill. That look that astronaughts give to the camera inside the cockpit around T-minus five seconds. That look that says I’m scared and I’m ready to have a blast at the same time.  Whatever.  Fucking A.  On our run back last night, Dylan looked like one of those caveman drawings you see in Biology textbooks. He’s got his weird hump to his walk. His head is low like the zenith above is going to come crashing down any second.   I guess even best guy friends slash revolutionaries can be scared once in a while. I guess that’s what he wants to do to himself.   Dylan tells me that people are always telling us that uncertainty is the worst feeling we can have. Dylan with his caveman dance says that if God does exist, he certainly isn’t following a game plan because nothing makes sense in the world, and that’s what makes it so amazing and beautiful. We are the control freaks of the world, Dylan whispers to me while you can hear ministers cursing a few dozen yards behind us. “The United States is so afraid of the unknown we invest money and troops to every hotspot of the world. We’re not angels; those Old Testament angels with the legions of holy warriors purging entire cities just because they have anal sex. We’re not god’s personal hit man and I for one am certainly not apart of the plague that’s strengthening a moral blanket that makes cups that aren’t biodegradable.”   We’ve just all got to learn to let go once in a while, he adds. We have to learn to let go by blowing something up once in a while, and he tells me there is no shame in that.  I laugh really hard and say “Whatever, man.”  I snap back, and I’m screaming it now. “SALVATION!” I scream that I demand sanctuary from a society that tries to steal my faith. I tell them I don’t have a god because I want to find him on my own, if I can find him. Everyone’s looking at me. The ceiling lights are burning my flesh. The circle is wide enough for me to dive through an opening if I needed to.  Which I need to, in about T-whatever seconds.  Alison’s mouth is open, and just like that; I hear a deep, load, and scratchy scream down the stairwell to my 2 o’clock. It’s Dylan. Either Dylan is charging Fort Wagner to restore the south’s glory or he’s showing me that the wrong thing might be the right thing for once. Dylan’s cutting the lights.  I smile and flash, everyone’s been isolated. I have that weird negative imagine burned into my cornea of Alison’s shocked expression and her open mouth. I lunge into the hole, and soon enough my tongue in jammed down her thought, and we’re sucking each other’s faces in. We’re grabbing at each other like primitive cavemen, and it feels good.  I push off of Alison.  I run.  I run out of the negative hole the circle left open, and I just close my eyes and feel my way out to the door. Everyone’s screaming and some kids are making weird hooting sounds.  I start sprinting as soon as I make it to the door, and I see a weird shape that looks a lot like Dylan. He’s waving to me, as old maple trees obscure the view a little and I can see him mouth the words, “That was fun.” I make a fist and everything feels good.  Dylan and I just kept running away. We ran for as long as we felt that we needed to. We’re still running. I’m so tired and hungry and deprived of oxygen that my brain doesn’t really think, it just does and what I’m doing is running.  For once in my life, nothing exists except Dylan’s blurb of a person and the cold mountain wilderness.  For once, everything makes sense.  Everything makes sense, and where we’re going from here who knows.  We just kept running from salvation, and where we will end up doesn’t really matter.
