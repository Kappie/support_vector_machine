Or if your trying to do something to make someone go away, but it makes them get closer/more annoying. It's crazy really. I think it's just payback though. For something we're doing, trying to do, or not supposed to be doing. But sometimes irony can be helpfull. Like when your looking for someone, there looking for you, and you run into each other and cry to each other your desperate message that was so important, only to find that you have the answer to their problem, and they have the answer to yours. Crazy huh? Well...I don't know...I just thought it was funny... My life is full of irony...(No, not iron. That's my blood that's full of that. But that's another story)
