Anyway here's the past few days in quasi-chronological order. 1) Crosby, Stills, and Nash Concert: My whole family came to this one and it was good. Very Good. I saw Neil Young last winter and he was amazing and CSN was on par with that show. They messed with "love the one you're with" which was weird but the organ solo was still incredible and as it turned out much better live. "southern cross" was good enjoyable as was the general anti-bush/Enron/ken lay rant the band had the whole time. 2) Ryan got back from France and we saw Spiderman 2 (good) and King Arthur (not so good).  3) I spent two days and the Democratic offices in Roseville stuffing envelopes. On the second day we had to label four thousand postcards before the post office stopped taking our mail, which turned out to be kinda fun just because everyone was yelling the entire time, we did it in time which was cause for celebration. 4) I got to see the 1982 Cal-Stanford game twice on ESPN Classic which, if you have a mild interest in college football or general greatness, I strongly recommend you see.  Next week TOK starts and I'm attending the Doobie Brothers concert, both of which should be interesting, to say the least.
