I'd like to ask that you bloggers extend an invitation to the "exceptional" students of our school, you might be pleasantly suprised at the results.  P.P.S.  My post is my honost, albeit aggressive opinion.  I do not apologize for anything I've said, but none of it is meant to be offensive.  If you have any questions, come to me personally and I'll explain them individually.  Love Rob
