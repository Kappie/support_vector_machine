      Well,  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  was incredible.  I expected it to be good, but it was even better than I expected.  It was heartbreaking and uplifting.  To me it is the best kind of movie, the kind where I felt a little different after seeing it.  I saw it in my favorite theatre in the world, the Royal Park Stadium.  It was pretty empty last night, and I think I counted 15 people in Eternal Sunshine.  I saw a trailer for a movie called  urlLink Garden State , which looks good.  I killed some time in Borders after the movie, and spent my last bit of money on the new  urlLink Death Cab for Cutie , which is fantastic.  The Borders in Gainesville has the best men's room wall grafitti.  Glad to hear you had a good Easter weekend.  I spent the day with family.  We had a big family lunch at my great aunt's, who lives in the middle of nowhere, and I mean literally the middle of nowhere, twenty minutes plus away from "civilization."  There's the true story of my great uncle who had a heart attack that we always wonder if it would have been completely fatal, except that it took the ambulance so long to get to him because he lives just in the middle of nothing.  So I saw lots of family, some of which I hadn't seen since I was younger ("Our little boys all growns up"), and ate lots of food, and had some very rural times.  No drinking for me, and no cops breaking anything up.  So now that's all over, and I guess the next holiday we have to look forward to is, what, 4th of July?  Fight restroom advertising!
