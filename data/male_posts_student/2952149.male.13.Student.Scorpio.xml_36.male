When I asked why he said he is moving to Wakefield Massachusetts and the other day Chad said that in 10th grade he might move to either Germany or Canada because his mom is a teacher and they may do this teacher exchange program...but if he were to move today, frankly I wouldn't give a you know what because he ass been a real jerk lately....but still. My life is getting kinda gay right now.
