I guess its another story of teenage love gone wrong and life going by too fast. Another teen spilling his story and heart onto a blog looking for insight and pity. Maybe I need some, maybe I'm just bored. The life of irresponsibility is slipping me and I don't want to grow up.  I had a rude awakening this summer and its something you never want to hear about in your profession. I thought to myself that I had a lot of power in this job, whether or not I realize it, I do. It scares me. I haven't been out much this summer, the people I really want to hangout with have been the people out on vacations or not answering my calls. It doesn't bother me that much, it gives me more time with my guitar and a clear sky. speaking of my guitar, if you play one or need another player or just want me to entertain you, call me. I'm bored, I'm going to sleep.
