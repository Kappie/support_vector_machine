I got the idea that for studies of video games, there are observers, but not particpaters in the study of video games.  I also had some... really good dreams last night. There was a series of dreams involving this girl... very interesting not just for the nudity involved, but the whole travelling to see her thing was weird. I managed to get on a plane with a pocket knife and they were serving microwave pepperoni pizza on the plane. Oh yea and she was rolling around naked with 2 other girls.   ***
