As always, it is a romance story based on high school, yet not totally. And it has lead me to realise how much high school, or sec school to JC in our case, can teach you about life.   Life at our stage seems to be very shallow at first sight. Yes, we have friends, we have our stereotypes, the sportsmen, the popular guys, the funny ones, the good-looking ones, the wierd ones, and of course, the losers. The nerds. We all play a role. Those at the bottom scramble to get to the top. Those who fail will remember it as a scar for life. But usually everyone forgets the bad part of high school they went through, only remembering the good times, but theres something you are missing. Something big. No matter what you experience, good or bad, it enriches your transitional stay in this phase of life.  Alot of people want to be 'in'. They want to be at the top, to be gazed upon with admiration, and to own the school. Many fail. As the movie goes, it only takes one person to think you are cool, and no one will dare to oppose it. As true as it may be, sometimes it is just so hard to make it happen. Just one person.  And for this one person, there are many who cries, and despairs, wondering if they ever get a taste of being popular. Of being in. They may spend hours in front of the mirror, or hours going in their heads; is there something wrong with me? Is there muck on my nose or something? Why does everyone hate me?  I just want to tell everyone, who has read up till this point, that as Drew Barrymore said, no matter what stereotype you are, learn who you truly are, and don't be afraid to live it. There are those who will always be beautiful, those that are always popular, those that are more academically oriented, and the few special people that are close to your heart. And though you will always be one of them, there will always be others like you whom you can relate to. Also, learn to appreciate not only the joys, but the sorrow that comes with life. For every bad day out of a year thrown at you, appreciate it. That is life, something which no one really understands, but which everyone experience. It is a beautiful equation of contrasts and contradictions, of sorrow and joy. You can never fully experience joy unless you know sorrow, because when everthing bad that can possibly happen, you will find the simplest pleasures intoxicating. When you a going through a bad patch in your life, the roses at the end of the tunnel are all the more fragrant. And when you can love everything you can to hate, what is there more to despair about, to fear? Such is life. And when you can take a break from it to step out and see, to reflect, that is when you can experience a different type of joy and contentment, a sort of bliss that come from within. This is what i believe.  Romantic movies are not always as soapy as you think they are. They are about love, but also so much more. They explore life in a way action movies and comedies can't.
