Heres my *revised* Eastern lineup  LINE 1 - (Scoring 1) LW Patrik Elias (NJD) C Mats Sundin (TOR) RW Jaromir Jagr (NYR)  LINE 2 - (Scoring 2) LW Ilya Kovalchuk (ATL) C Scott Gomez (NJD) RW Martin St. Louis (TAM)  LINE 3 - (Checking 1) LW Simon Gagne (PHI) C Bobby Holik (NYR) RW Jeremy Roenick (PHI)  LINE 4 - (Checking 2) LW Mike Ribeiro (MON) C Vincent Lecavalier (TAM) RW Jamie Langenbrunner (NJD)  DEFENSIVE PAIRINGS Zdeno Chara (OTT) Scott Niedermayer (NJD)  Scott Stevens (NJD) Eric Desjardins (PHI)  Sergei Gonchar (BOS) Brian Rafalski (NJD)  GOALTENDERS Martin Brodeur (NJD) Robert Esche (PHI) Ed Belfour (TOR)  Any all-star team has to have Jagr on the #1 scoring line. He had a crap season and was still in the top 5% of offensive players in the whole NHL. He kicks ass.   Something quite disturbing I saw on Y! news when I got back...  "Man Fatally Bitten by Sexually Aroused Horse"  Oh, and any suggestions for improving this place in a comment please. Or over MSN. Whatever floats your boat. "J'aime aller a la toilette!"
