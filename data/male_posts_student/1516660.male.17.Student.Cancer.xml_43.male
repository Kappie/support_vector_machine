We went a bit too fast during "cheng ji si han..." that part during Ba Jun Zhan. And Mr Low correctly pronounced Ba Jun Zhan!!! Finally! After pronouncing it as "Bah Jung Zhang" for yesterday's performances, he finally got it correct this time. I wonder who told him. Ayiah!!   I also tripped while walking down the stage!   I was too busy looking at the teachers (and wondering why Tsung did not clap) that I didn't notice the mike wire. I entangled myself and suffered a few seconds of embarrassment. How  embarrassing ! WQ later told me the people up there shouted "Kelvin Yip!!" when I tripped. Now the whole school knows my name!  Today we stayed back to watch the netball inter-class competition. Our class "cheng ba"ed and ended up in the finals with 4/6. This is so reptitive! we are always competing against 4/6 and   losing  . This time was not li wai. We lost by 2 marks. We orignally were tied but then we started losing lor. However, we were given second place. Which was not too bad. It is at least better than 3rd or 4th isn't it? Well done team!!
