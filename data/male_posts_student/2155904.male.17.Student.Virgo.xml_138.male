Then Ekul came, and Elyk, and Purdy, and Macaroon, and Skippy, and Karla, and Dudely Doo, and Haras, and Kramm, and Amyazing, and that is all of the people who have names or are easy enough to make a semi-decent name for on the spot (i.e. Elyk).  Broom ball was pretty good again.  The game was a blowout.  Tyke was with Ekul, and Purdy, and Tina, and Macaroon, and Elyk, and Piggy J, and Dotti, and they pwned.  It was such a blowout.  Tyke was of course the goalie because he is extremely good.  He was 1st team All-State goalie.  Ekul was 1st team All-State defense.  Elyk was 1st team All-State forward.  Macaroon was 2nd team All-State midfield.  Tina was honorable mention All-State midfield.  And Purdy was honorable mention All-State forward.  The team was stacked.  Tyke kept the shutout and they won 11-0.  It was awesome.  Tyke used his insane soccer skills as goalie and didn't let anything in.  He now has a very swollen left ankle from one time when he kicked clear the ball and it was a hard ball and it hit his ankle and it hurts pretty bad now.  But he is tough.  He can take it.  After broom ball they went back to Dotti's and watched Aladdin and the Tolo video again.  In the tv room there was quite a showing for Tyke.  In that one room there were 4 different girls that Tyke has at one point felt quite strongly about.  He of course noticed that while sitting there.  Thinking about things.  Tyke often is with at least one girl he has had strong feelings for but 4 is pretty high.  4 doesn't even do it justice because some of those girls he has liked multiple times or for a long time consecutively (how odd does that sound??) so it is really more like 7-8 girls.  It wasn't very weird though.  But it does kinda suck being with couples all the time and watching a quasi-romantic movie.  It's better than being alone by far but when Tyke would rather be the guy that is with the girl than the guy who is adjacent to the guy with the girl, it is a little harder.  Feelings are much more apparent when jealousy is mixed in.  Sometimes Tyke doesn't really know how he feels about someone until he sees what he wants to be doing.  That sounds a little unhealthy and it makes it sound like jealousy is fueling everything but it at least gets the point across.  Tyke doesn't like to think of himself as a jealous person but then again he must be.  For he has never truly had a reason to be jealous because he is always jealous of the boyfriend.  So it isn't like he is the boyfriend and he is jealous of another guy.  Then it is worse but it at least the guy has something to lose while Tyke has nothing to lose so he has nothing to be jealous of.  Just longing.  Tyke's favorite "L" word.  Longing.  Well, favorite as in used frequently and fits Tyke to a "T" (whatever that stems from).  Sometimes it is hard being a respectable, well-liked, social, emotional, touchy, single teenage boy.  Because to this stage Tyke has no memories of anything.  Karla is his closest kiss but that is a funny story that you have most likely heard before and you can ask Tyke about it sometime if you haven't heard it but all Tyke knows is hugs.  Which is why he is always wanting a hug.  And he never wants to leave somewhere without saying goodbye and a hug.  Which makes it disappointing if that doesn't happen.  Especially cuz Tyke realizes that everytime he says goodbye to someone it could be the last time so he wants to make sure that he does say goodbye.  And a hug is meaningful to Tyke.  It shows that you care.  Because a lot of people aren't huggers (either in general or just to Tyke) so that makes it more special other times.  So Tyke knows what he is looking for in a girl (mainly cuz he has found so much of what he wants in a certain girl) so he knows what he wants.  And he used to really be looking forward to college to finding that girl, or any girl to start with.  But now he is more reserved about that.  Because college will be much different than high school.  He just wants to stay in high school for now but be able to find a girl that can satisfy some of his needs.  And not be a source of angst for Tyke either (e.g. have a boyfriend).  Just a lot of wishing and longing for something that can't be changed.  It either will happen or it won't.  It will either happen now or later or never.  You're either bluffing or you're not.  That pretty much sums it up.  Tyke tried to leave it on a bit of an up note.  Thanks.
