Didn't stall out once, Hazah! Well the meeting was great, we had a party to celebrate everything over the last year. Watched a slide show, got nifty scout mugs and had snacks. So one of our best meetings ever I'd say. Well I'm just sittin' around now, I have to go to bed soon cause I need to get up on time tomorrow. Buenos noches!
