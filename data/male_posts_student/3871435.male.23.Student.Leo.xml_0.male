According to  urlLink this link  THAT IS NOT ADVISABLE!  Why? Because it will bring out tannic acids. Tannic acid causes the tea to taste bitter, the same way when leaving your tea to brew for longer than usual. Phew! Now I know why my stomach gets upset sometimes.  I will place the link at the side (the one that says the obvious...) for you to peruse at your own leisure. Meanwhile, gotta go back to surfing!  Me who still looks for a good book... maybe I'll place a corner for my Book of the Month, that sort of thing...
