If anybody wants any graphics done then email me: " urlLink traxor@gmail.com ".  Even only if you need me too do a small bit of editing, I am willing to do it for you, as you may have read, the holidays are boring as hell, so it gives me something to do that I enjoy doing a lot!    The skarz site is finished!! Finally after about 8 Hours work on the template etc. I have completed the site!! Its really good, well at least I think so, we have around 25 people in skarz though, so I apologise for the lack of all of the Profiles, They will definitely be up on the site as soon as I can get them up, even if I don't have the Picture yet, I will put them up.      I wrote a poem last night when I should've been sleeping, after reading some of my new book, I decided too lye down and write a poem, but its really lame, so i'm not even going to dare post it, as it will just lead too me being shy and embarassed when the person who its to reads it, but I think that she'll make me tell it her anyway, which will make me shy, which  sucks!!!
