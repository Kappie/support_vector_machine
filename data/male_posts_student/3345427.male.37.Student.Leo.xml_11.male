I love it when a book jumps off the shelf and says "BUY ME." After long deliberation and inner struggle I decided to pick it up.  Having been a many year, multiple book, Harry Potter supporter, I just could not bring myself to betray that and go read another book like that. Harry Potter and I share the same birthday, (July 31st ) it does say that HP was born on July 31st in book one. What a coinkidink!!!  Anyway, Eragon was a boy who lived in Carvahall in the land of Alagaesia...who happens upon a sapphire object, which turns out to be a Dragons Egg. Not just any dragon's egg, mind you. It was a special dragon's egg. Hence begins the trilogy of Eragon in " INHERITANCE." book 1.  I get caught up in books, visually and descriptively. I get into books, I escape into worlds unknown. I live in my character's heads. I see with their eyes. And I become them. Such is the world of a great reader. I can sit for hours upon hours reading like this and I have done that. Cup of Earl Grey, a rainy day or night...comfy sheets and a great book.  Eragon became part of my lexicon. And So here Eragon holds the Court in my blog. I just thought you would like to know who Eragon was. You can get info on Eragon and check in the website and fan club of Eragon at( www.alagaesia.com).  Book Two is in the works by Christopher Paolini. He's such a great writer. I may be getting older, but I still read like a young boy. Excited about the next adventure and the traveling of the journey. Hell, why not. The world is so strife with war and pain and pestilence. To escape into a world never seen is greater than living in misery and fear all the time.  They say "Eragon" will make it to the silver screen...I can't wait for that.  Eragon fans UNITE.....  bye...  i love you jon.
