     
      It's Thursday night and I'm supposed to be writing an email to this guy I'm sort-of seeing. Somehow I encountered an ad for Blogger and 6 minutes later I find myself writing my first entry. Is this the ultimate form of procrastination or am I really just a space cadet? You'll have to decide for yourself.
