The biggest source of excitement while I was there was the "downtown," which consisted of pretty much the only area that wasn't houses, but businesses. There was a place with pizza. Some of the notable things there were: -There is no soda in VC. There is, however, an abundance of something called "pop." -There is some kind of incredible population of prairie dogs and deer in the area. There are enough deer hit by cars each year to account for just about every driver in VC. -OMFG pelicans! Holy crap! Pelicans seemed like a joke before, like homosexual ogres or something. -The greatest population of geezers I have ever seen. It's almost a sad story, really. The cycle began with strapping young couples buying rich, lucrative farmland long ago. The womanfolk apparently got fed up with it or something, and they either died or moved away. So now, you have a dying generation of mostly childrenless old men that own all the farmland in VC. Obviously, entertaining legal battles will follow their deaths. Well, not excatly entertaining, more like [adjective that describes the loss of faith in the human race]. (If you know of one, by all means let me know, I'll use it often, no doubt.) -I saw, at a mall, two diamond stores directly across the hall from eachother. I really want that adjective. -There was a liquor store with a drive-thru that looked to have been converted from a carwash. The sign on it said, "driver must be 21 to enter." I'm not sure what it was about it, it seems like a sensible idea, but every member of my family laughed at it when we went through.(By the way, I don't drink, smoke, or indulge in other things that the tv says is bad for you. But I did it before it was cool.) -The mosquitos were considerably smaller than the Alaska breed, and of a tan coloration. I laughed(and occasionaly swore) at their feeble and merely annoying attempts. Alaska mosquitos are our fucking state birds. -Mountain Dew seems to be popular down there. It was served almost everywhere I went, and some people had Dew Hoodies. This filled my soul with warmth and my bladder with torment as I relished the opportunity. Often, I have to settle for Root Beer at establishments up here. Soon, it was time for us to leave. So, we boarded a plane and went to Denver, where we would then catch a plane to Seattle and drive to Tacoma. There was another baby. In Denver, there were foot traffic jams in the airport. When I wasn't fuming, I was laughing inside. However, I began to develop an acute paranoia of pickpockets, recalling just about every movie I have ever seen featuring a large city. I assume my jerky, wild-eyed glares at passerby and people behind me in line, all while nervously fingering whatever was hidden in my pockets(I love pockets. I literally don't think I could leave my house without a good set of pockets. I choose pants based around this criteria and barely even glance in mirrors. If I don't have enough pockets, I toss on a hoodie with an abundant pouch, or grab my little bike bag/satchel that goes everywhere with me.). Many things were, and generally are, indeed sequestered away in them. Most of them, with some imagination and determination, could even be lethal. Luckily, I possess an abundance of both. Fortunately, I escaped the villanous hive of scum and villany that is the Denver International Airport with my belongings intact. I ate McDonalds. In Chicago, there was a place called the Billy Goat Grill, or some sort of combination of the words Billy, Goat, Gruff, and Grill. I forget. Anyway, they made a fine cheeseburger, and some pretty good fries as well. Babies. There were Babie s  on this flight. See that fuckin' "s" there? That denotes plural. Each additional child increased my hatred of everything around me exponentially. In Seattle, we were welcomed by our aunt and uncle there. All of our family in Seattle and Tacoma is really great. They're very open and fun-loving, and it's always a treat to visit them. Anyway, we drove by an oriental-themed carwash, which struck me as notable. We did some neat stuff. A trip to the zoo was involved. You may be thinking, "Dude, you're 16 and you go to the zoo with your mom and grandma? What in the fuck?!" That's a good-sized rant altogether, I think, and I may get off on that tangeant later. In fact, I'll make a point of it. So, the zoo was neat. We saw a lady in a wheelchair with a seeing-eye poodle. Another first. A bird had built it's nest inside the observation building for the marine mammals and kept flitting in and out while we marveled at the antics of the walrus, which consisted largely of meandering about on a pretty much set circuit around his pool. Later, a bunch of people came to my aunt/uncle's house, and we had a fire in the backyard with barbecued meats, and sang songs and such. Of particular note was the time we spent in Seattle proper, when we saw some of the sights and visited Gameworks. Gameworks is a large chain of arcades, with an interesting system of payment- you pay and get a little card with so much credit on it. The card works for just about every machine in the place. Mon-Fri a timed card was available, so you could play free for ridiculously cheap rates until your hours were up, and that was neat because I conquered House of the Dead 3, which was annoying because not even zombies should be able to withstand upwards of four-five shotgun blasts in their goddamn face, and later I came back with a 25-dollar card and played DDR until my lungs bled. This is one of my favorite pasttimes. I often visit a neighborhood theater where for .50 I can play 4/5 songs, I forget,(DDR Extreme, the best version) with extras unlocked. One thing of note was that we were technically not allowed to share cards as we were flatly informed at the front desk. I asked if they had people hovering behind us to make sure that we kept our cards to ourselves at all times, because I couldn't really see any other way to insure that their policy was obeyed, and I was answered cryptically with "there are a lot of people on the floor." I spent a lot of my visit glancing behind me. I also had the opportunity to visit the Scifi Museum/Hall of Fame, which was fan-fucking-tabulous. Pretty much everywhere you went, you could find some kind of street musician or performer. The interesting thing was, they were all  really  good. I mean it. These are probably the guys you hear about who are "just waiting for their big break." They were good. There was one guy with a saxophone standing on a corner near a steaming grate while we wandered around looking for a diner that served clam chowder. He really set the mood, cause it was getting kind of dark. Down by the market, there were a few fellows with a parrot. The parrot was leaping and gallivanting about on top of some flat platform they had set out, and there was one guy leaning on a piano having a smoke break. I assumed that, of course, they would play the piano and the bird frolicked more or less in tune. Right now it seemed to be doing fine without the actual music. There was also a nice man who asked us for directions and then offered to sell us drugs. There was kind of a large park where the museum and Imax theater(we saw Harry Potter 3) were situated, and we encountered some regular old hobos, as well as a pudgy old man wearing a rather intense scowl. This was complemented by the intricate four-foot balloon hat nestled on his head, and the balloon animals festooning the walls of his stall. On our way back to our quarters, we happened to see yet  another  city personality- the raving lunatic. The disheveled fellow clutched some sort of scepter in one hand, and a large cardboard sign in the other. He held the scepter up high and wobbled it about a little while shouting his nonsensicals. His sign mentioned the Seattle government, police force, and several variations of the word "communist." He was approached by someone as we walked by avoiding eye contact, and asked if he made the scepter himself. I believe he said he did. It was a rather nice looking piece, too, I remember. Finally, we had to leave. On the flight home, we are accompanied by the most obnoxious baby yet. At this point, I have all but conquered both of the new gameboy games I bought for the trip, I cannot find the batteries for my CD player, and I have voraciously consumed the contents of every book within reach. I busy myself by pondering why the baby has to wail so damn much. Obviously, as a start, the baby is dumb, and this is the only way it can communicate with the world, with which it appears rather displeased at the moment. However, as the flight wears on, it becomes apparent from being forced to listen to the continued noise, which is becoming more and more throaty and raspy, that it must also be causing quite a bit of discomfort to the child as well. I therefore conclude that the fiend continues its wailing and shrieking because it so delights in the particular and extreme discomfort that it instills in other people, that it will continue to do so even until it causes itself pain. I am struck with the idea that an extra pillow or two might help, and contemplate the proper placement to insure complete blockage of oxygen to the body.
