I am sitting here next to the girlfriend at her apartment in Guadalajara. I have been with her every minute of the past 5 days, and it's been great!    Martita: We even got to sleep next to each other at the beach... different beds tho    JD: damn.    Martita: we were talking like 2 days ago and we realized that pretty boy actually NEVER asked me out... so i cant call him "boooooooooooyfriiiieeeend" anymore...    JD: well, we have been a happy couple so far so i don't see why it matters...    Martita: i just think its funny im not complaining or anything, bf or not bf HE IS MINE...    JD: All yours, nobody elses :P Well anyways, we spent the first three days at the beach at an all included... like 6 star hotel... I drank my first Piña Colada and I have decided that it's now my favorite drink. Martha got burninated...    Martita: Im allergic to the sun, the beach's sun at least... like my dad... JD liked my new bathing suit! yay...    JD: She got bumps on her... itch itch! Hmmm, but anyways here in Guadalajara we've been doing a lot of nothing... well except going to malls and stuff. We went to one today and I actually had a really good time just walking around the whole thing like 5 times with her even if we didn't buy anything...    Martita: im tired, but the bf wanted to write a co-blog thingy...    JD: Because "the people (cough cough mike) demanded a blog".... well and I owe you guys one, it's been over a month since i posted anything... I've been so busy! Mission trip, jazz camp, soccer camp, 2 beach trips (3 if u count the one in Mexico), and the girlfriend biting my arm...    Martita: hey! im not biting his arm... licking is something different and thats just bc the keyboard and his arm r kind of crooked so his arm is right infront of me... and as we all know pretty boy is yummy...    JD: So is the girlfriend... I never asked for her to try and look better for me when I came... but dizzam! But she doesn't believe me when I say that she is pretty...    Martita: finally some1 noticed the diet thingy...    JD: Hmmmm.... well i have 5 days left here    Martita interrupts: thats if i dont destroy his birth certificate first...    JD: yes.... what a shame it would be if i couldn't leave the country!!! :)    Martita: JD has tried atole, tacos, chalupas, sweet bread, coconut, coconut juice, chongos zamoranos, tamarind water, frijoles refritos, guacamole (the real 1), real salsa, etc...    JD: and I've spoken more spanish already than the entire last trip! Disculpe señorita, pero me gustan sus pompas!    Martita: umm... huh? I think the water has afected him a little...    JD: No.... I said that 2 u remember?    Martita: then the water has been afecting me... im tired...    JD: uh oh, i think that's a sign that we should cut this blog a little short. Te quieroooooo!    Martita: i do too, but more, duh! -_- good night people...    JD: Nighty night.    PS: JD hasnt gotten hurt as much as last time...   PS2: Just stabbed in the toe and cut up on lava rocks in the sea... it's all good though :P  PS3: Martha is no n00b...
