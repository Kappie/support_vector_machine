Anyways, right now I am downloading this Photoblogging thing so you can actually see pictures on here! cool huh? hello? oh yea nobody reads this...  Anyways, me and marty are gonna get together on Saturday and work together on writing music and lyrics, when we write lyrics we seem to think our own is stupid, so maybe if we work together we will have more self confidence.  I think this will really help just sitting down me and him.  Also, we have another guitarist all of a sudden who is really good? I dunno, I just found out today, but I think we have enough problems as it is.  It might work, I always wanted to try having two guitarists.  So, I am going to do some homework, I feel better than I did when i had that earlier post.
