In the meantime, I've been waiting for the "system to metastasize" over on  urlLink I Love Bees  and it was supposed to today. Looking at the main page, however, results in things being completely the same; very very wierd indeed. To view a bunch of upset, tired and above all disappointed nerds, check out the  I Love Bees Blog  and join in their misery. I know I am - however, it's not 1:25 here in Australia, so it's not so bad.  Strangely, a couple of Bungie fellas were spotted on the Bungie office  urlLink webcam . Spotted wearing hats, no less. Strange going-ons indeed.  Seriously though... it can't have metastasized yet... can it? Ah well. Back to playin' the Warthog Rally, Blood Gulch, all rockets, 400% health. It's like World's Scariest Police Chases, only fun!
