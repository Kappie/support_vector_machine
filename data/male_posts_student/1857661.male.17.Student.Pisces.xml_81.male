I think it is time to set my targets for the next trial. Perhaps, I should start studying already, but I'm way too lazy. All I care now is to finish Onimusha 3 as soon as possible! Maybe I would just start revising during the holidays...   Random topic of the day  Quite a few people often thinks that I like Kelly or Julia. I might be close to them, but I just like them as a friend. Besides, they already have a boyfriend... It's just funny how rumours are made up.
