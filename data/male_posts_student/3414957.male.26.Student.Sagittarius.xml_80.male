So I am tired of moving tables and cabinets and computers. I need to do a little english homework but that should go smooth. I will listen to Phil Hendrie while I do it. I love Phile Hendrie. Somethings in life that have been constant for me is my love of the Phil Hendrie Show. For over 7 years I listen and laugh at all the stupid people who call in and argue with his "guests".     To follow The Way, is to follow your destiny
