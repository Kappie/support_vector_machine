I really just need to get down and make a true webpage than this crap. - Speaking of growing, I think I'm changing... I don't know, maturing? I feel different than I did 3 months ago. How odd. It's more mental than physical. Emotionally I'm different. Perhaps this is the last stage of adolescence. It's odd, though, to have your mental growth faster than physical.... ok, this post is already becoming too reflective to be coherent. - Board update: GOT. Georgia Officer Training is next Tuesday. How exciting! - My mother's going to be a chaperone at this year's 4-H Tubing Rally. This... could be a bad thing or a good thing. ;-) - I'm wanting to wrap up "Sophie's World" this weekend. But, then there's that  urlLink iTunes contest...  so tempting. - I have an immense headache and a yearning for my bed. Good night.
