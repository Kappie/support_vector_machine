I have always wanted to blog, because sumtime during the day, I will get a really interesting idea or sumthing, and I will want to write about it...but then I forget about it by the next day....I only remember three of them: 1.)Rusty 2.)Keli 3.)Peeing with one hand or two....*ew*  Ya, see, in my head I had this whole in-depth outlook on all three of these issues, but, when I try to speak about them outloud, I just sound like a retard....which I probaBly do most of the time anyway...:-S GO self-esteem!  I totally forgot what I was going to say.....shit.  Yesterday/today Rusty, Kenny, Carly, and I started a new FFCC campaign...and we kick ass!  Especailly with Carly's physics....ge he he he he.  Sorry, inside joke.  Either way, we all stayed there until like 3:30 in the morning...and then I got to drive myself home that late....fun, NOT!  It was possibly the koolest/ most perverted time in my life!!  It seriously rocked hardcore.....  TODAY IS THE DDR PARTY!!!!!  I can finally show that I don't suck AS much anymore....hopefully.  Hopefully it will be kool, and not too awkward....  I've taken up enough of your time just talking randomly.... Peace!  Spense
