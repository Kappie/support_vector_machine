Girl I know you aint mine  But baby I'm yours baby baby I'm yours...  I'm tellin all my friends would ya wanna swap me some  Cause I aint in control here,  maybe baby all I need is to be the man  Even for a minute that's cool with me...   Girl when I first got ya I had it all, lest I ever knew That I was bein hooked I was hookin you... But you were hookin me to I can't even step out to see my boys anymore Cause I got my baby knowin everytime I hit the door Ah shit I broke it off I aint that dumb And tell all my buddies would ya wanna swap me some?
