The previous night, a special ops meeting had taken place in an American outpost just outside of Warbah, Kuwait.  Attending, had been Joshua Bradley, a member of the American delta force.  Bradley had been called to rescue another member of the Special Forces that had been captured earlier in the week. Not only to rescue him, but to also reacquire his explosives and destroy the bridge that should have already been in rubble.  The POW, Jim Foley, along with another of his comrades, was sent to destroy a bridge, on the Iraqi, Kuwait border; 50 miles south of Umm Qasar.  However, guards spotted them and Foley was captured.  Thus Bradley’s call.  Taken to the outpost, he was briefed on the situation and put on the helicopter to the Kuwait Iraqi border.    	Sitting in the helicopter now, Bradley sweated.  Just thinking of the job he had to do overwhelmed him.  According to the intelligence compound, he was going to have to pass through the guards and checkpoints unnoticed.  If the alarm was raised, then things would become difficult.  In the cockpit, the pilot glanced back at him and noticed that he was studying his map.  Indeed he was, he wasn’t given a GPS this round.  They would take to long to connect to the satellite and, at worst, might be pin pointed giving away his position.  A bump jolted him from his studying.  He looked up and saw the drop point.  His rifle, a colt m-167A with an attached grenade launcher, sat ready in his hands. It was just before dawn, the sun was already beginning to rise, and the dew had already soaked into the ground.  “Ok! This is it!”  That was his cue.  The helicopter was 15 feet above the ground; it was time to go.   Bradley slid to the ground on rope.  He watched as the helicopter sailed away.  In his mind he could still hear his commanding officer, “Ok, just get in, get Foley, get the C4, blow the bridge, get out.  BUT! Remember! If the alarm is raised, you’re probably toast.  Stealth is everything.”   	 	It was quiet now, the helicopter was already on its way back to base, and he was alone.  He crunched his way through the underbrush and scoped the area.  He was in a canyon.  There were two sheer, smooth rock walls on either side.  A way down the path, there was a steady decline in the terrain. The path wiggled side to side in the same fashion of switchbacks.  A small building was at the landing.  Across from the building was a ditch the spread the length between either side of the canyon walls.  A bridge, large and strong, strong enough for a tank Bradley noted, was on the far left side of the ditch.  Carefully, he inched his way to the first low drop on by the top of the switchback.  On the landing were three trucks one crossing the bridge and the other two waiting in line.  Suddenly, the roaring sounds of a jet sounded. Frantically he looks around, fearing that it would give away his position.  Interestingly enough, it was an allied A-10 Warthog.  Squinting, he could make out something falling from the plane’s bomb bay.  The ordinance howled as they pounded the tow trucks on the landing. The third made it over the bridge.  On impact, a man ran out of the building.  He was armed.  Seeing this, Bradley scrunched down even lower.  As he steadied his rifle the sights were leveled.  The rifled sounded off as three shots burst through the crisp air.  As another soldier saw his fellow on the ground, he looked up and spotted the sweating Specialist.  As the enemy opened fire so did Bradley.  Having a better weapon and training far exceeding his opponent’s, the combatant fell quickly.  Upon seeing his opponent on the ground, acting rather un-life like, he stood up and made his way down the path.  However, another soldier came across the bridge.  Seeing Bradley, he took cover behind a sign near the bridge.  A sign doesn’t hold up very well against a grenade.  Neither does the man behind the sign.  Continuing down the path, he trotted towards the building on the landing.    Entering, he found a radio, medical supplies, and a refrigerator that had food in it, but was unplugged.  Not really finding another use for any item except the medical supplies, which he had already commandeered, he left.  After crossing the bridge, the path took two different routes.  One of which turned right and led up to a checkpoint. The other route went through another canyon and split into many different paths.  Having been warned to avoid detection, he decided upon the left route.  Walking cautiously down the path, he observed that the sun was fully raised.  Avoiding detection would be more difficult now than ever.  Ah, man! One wrong step and I’ll land myself in the pit with the rest of the MIAs.  Bradley tensed with every sound, watching cautiously around every corner.  He was in a small canyon, with rock on either side, smoothed by the blowing sand, and nothing but sand and dirt in between.
