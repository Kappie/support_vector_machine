My Plymouth Sundance just doesn't quite cut it anymore. I am not a huge fan of that car. It is an awesome car in general...just not mine. It has a very bad transmission.  Tammen said that he could have gotten the parts for me dirt cheap, but I guess my dad took time over cost. But whatever...its not quite my call. But I think that I still have to pay for it :S. That makes me a little mad. But once again its not like I am in control of my life...
