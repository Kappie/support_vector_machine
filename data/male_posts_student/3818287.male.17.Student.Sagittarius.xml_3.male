Here are just a few of the many, many punk-rock (even though just albums with a political minded title:  V/A - Rock Against Bush Vol. I  II Anti-Flag - The Terror State Bad Religion - The Empire Strikes First Green Day - American Idiot  And whether this has any influence at all in the way you will vote remains to be seen, but it's nice to see people, especially musicians, urging kids to not just vote for Bush, Kerry, or Nader, but to vote in general. MTV is playing ads supporting voting. Not voting for anyone in particular, just get out and vote. And I'm urging all my friends to vote. I'm going to miss being able to vote by 3 weeks, but that won't stop me from getting political come election time. Don't hate me becuase I got political....
