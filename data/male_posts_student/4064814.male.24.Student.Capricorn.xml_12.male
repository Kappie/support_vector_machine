It has been great spending the summer in Waterloo and being able to say goodbye to my friends as one by one they strike out to start their "real" lives.  First Matt and John, then Ben, Ming and Nat, then Drew, now Jon and soon Robin. It is beginning to dawn on me how much I will miss them. But this sense of loss is filled with an optimism as I wait to hear of their achievements as they each follow their own path.
