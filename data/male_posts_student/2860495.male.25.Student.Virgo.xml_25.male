One problem, I live down the street from a barbecue place.  Strangely enough, they have a picture of Ruby's in the men's room.  Anyway, every night, close to dinner time, the aroma of smoked meats and barbecue sauce enters my home.  I've wanted barbecue chicken every night that we've been here.  It's too much.  Beyond the smells, it's nice.  I seem to have settled on the fringe of the hispanic part of town, which is nice.  I've already found good mexican food and palettas.  It's nice.
