Thursday is Street Fair night, and all of us on this side of the family enjoy people watching, or "the festival of the passing parade" as my grandmother oft mentions.  Since it's summer, most of the tourists are out of town, meaning a number of merchants didn't show up...so the fair was pretty low-key, maybe 1000 people out, looking at pottery, art, glassware, or learning about what the Shriners do for the kiddies.    I love all of the people in California who shamelessly promote themselves and their wares.  After dinner, my grandparents and I walked the fair.  Our first stop was BELLANDO, a muscle-bound man with Whitesnake hair, wearing Fabio's wardrobe and armor left over from the shooting of Gladiator.  He played an electrical violin, soundtracked by canned synthesizer.  He stood on a foot pad because in front of him was a mix of mood lighting shining on his cherubian face, as well as a mini-fan that gave his hair the windblown look needed by any synthesized violin player at a street fair selling Yanni meets Harlequin Novels CDs.  His wife was the one selling the CDs; there were four, all with the same cover design, just in different colors.  I thought they were all the same CD; she said no, and turned to fawn over her musician.  I don't see how they couldn't be; the guy had one riff he could play, a Berlioz meets ELO A major scale that haunts on the final A.  I heard it at least 20 times.  I also heard him play a B flat scale and a C major.  When he adds a few minor scales to it, I'll consider buying.  Or if he switches to chain-mail armor.  Or lambent.    The little girl in the Welch's Grape Juice commercial looks like my aunt Phyllis.  Phyl is not asian.  She's a short 65 year old woman with the same facial structure and haircut as the girl.  I can't help but imagine her selling grape juice every time I see the commercial.  Someday I will ask her to pitch me a glass of grape juice.  Maybe if the girl goes down with the gout or some other fetid injury, my aunt can be her fill-in.   We got into Palm Springs yesterday afternoon, driving down the canyonside, listening to my dad tell stories of his youth, when he felt like he owned the city.  Several times he was arrested for his tom-foolery, such as stealing flags from the courthouse, trespassing on private golf courses, and sneaking into drive-in movies.  It's always the best part of the trip with him; his eyes light up, he gets excited about where he is, and his stories move, they don't meander in purgatory for minutes, instead punctuated by other memories that require quick telling before the next memory takes over.    All of this energy dissipates once we get back to my grandparents' house.  For the past seven years, the routine has been the same.  We walk in, to boisterous talk, hugs from me, and a few silly jokes that I tell, hoping to avoid the fated instances soon to occur.  I put my stuff in the guest room, and then the trouble ensues.  I end up going into the bathroom, my favoirte bathroom ever.  I usually sit in there for several minutes, just looking around.  When I get out, the family is in the sun room; my grandmother at the table, my dad in a rattan chair, and Frank (my pretty much grandfather) on the couch.  At this point, it is too late; positions are taken, and they're waiting for me to get into the blocks.  I meander for a while, but they sit quietly.  Finally, I succumb and sit down.  My dad then gets out a manilla folder, opening it slowly as he provides the unnecessary background:  As I work on the computer, I come across these emails and other bits of fun from friends like Big Al, Frank Farmer, you know.  I don't know, I just think they're fun.    My dad proceeds to read 15 or 20 email jokes, some witty, most not.  My grandmother laughs at each one, Frank doesn't really pay attention.  After the jokes are the newspaper clippings...my dad has piles for each of us on articles we might find interest in.  To this day, I have gained insight from one article he cut out for me, and it was a movie review on the back of the article he wanted me to read.    I'm flying through this because I want to get to the killer...my dad's assortment of kitsch.  After the newspaper articles (always prefaced with  read these if you want, I don't know, I just thought you might be interested ), he pulls out the odd stuff...fortune cookies, postcards, religious pamphlets...this trip it was a place setting from a chinese restaurant, the kind with the Chinese Zodiac on it, giving the years for each and theory on the people born in each.  He gets it out, and my grandmother immediately laughs; oh, look at that!  My dad smiles, and explains to all of us how the Chinese Zodiac works:   China is a land of superstition...there are twelve years in correlation with the twelve animals of the continent...   When I question the historical accuracy, my dad mentions that this is all in good fun... c'mon Rolin, this is fun, don't be so serious.   He then places the menu in front of me.  There are notes on it.  Sections are highlighted.  He points to one highlighted place.   Read that .  His index finger is in the air, holding attention, waiting for me to mechanically relate his point.  I refuse.  The highlighted section refers to his former girlfriend/ex-wife (long story) of five years ago; turns out this menu says they were not compatibale...year of the dragon versus year of the dog.  Written above year of the dog is SHARON; above year of the dragon, AL.  Highlighted under each is DRAGON IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH DOG, or vice versa.   It was written long ago that this wouldn't work out  he says.  When I mention that my mom is listed as a compatible mate for his animal, he puts the menu away.   I was just wanting to have some fun .     I will sit at the pool a lot today.  Probably go to the gym.  Enjoy the area.  This place can be a great haven.    I watched some CNN this morning...there was a 40 minute segment about Iran.  Are we going to war with Iran?  Wait, I thought Bush said we wouldn't go to war with them, they hadn't confronted us, they hadn't attacked before, there was nothing to show that they were against us....Axis of Evil, but not perpetuating.  Now they are.  I plan to protest until I am silly once this new band of shit starts.
