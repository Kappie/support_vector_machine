The rest of you, follow me.  We all know that France is against the war (Yay!), and we also know that the percentage of Americans who are pro-war (which is an unfortunately large amount) are angered at France for their position on the war.  I would hope that we're all aware of the food item known as "french fries", julienne pieces of potato, deep-fried and commonly served with a meal consisting of burgers or hot dogs (in any form of meat and/or batter).  Well, a restaurant in Washington D.C. decided to change " french  fries" to "  freedom   fries" because whoever felt angered at the French enough to go so far as to change a beloved side dish to an American advertisement for the war.  And I ask, what are we, four?  As if the American people haven't embarrassed ourselves enough in the past years, this makes us look pathetically juvenile (and this is coming from a guy who still watches cartoons on a regular basis).  I didn't mean to project my opinion so harshly, I was merely venting, and I invite all those reading this to press the "Give me shit" button (I really should change it back to "Contact") and give me your opinion, as well as anything I may have missed on the subject.  Thanks in advance.
