My mom wants to go down to Illinois to see my aunt, and I might be able to go too. I asked my boss if I can take off work on Sunday so that I can go down with her. He told me that he'll get back to me because he has to find someone to work for me. I'm crossing my fingers, hoping that I can get that day off. If I do get the day off, we're heading down tomorrow. I hope I can get my neighbor, who's also watching Big Brother 5, to tape it when it airs on Thursday and Saturday.  Last night, I saw a commercial while I was watching Last Comic Standing, and it reported that the second season of NBC's "The Apprentice" will begin airing on Thursday, September 9! I didn't get to watch the first season (well, I did get to see the premiere episode), but my cousin says that it was awesome. His favorite contestant was Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth! I'm not sure if I'm going to be watching it because it's probably going to be on while CBS's "Survivor: Vanuatu" is on. Reality TV World has announced that the new season of Survivor will begin airing on Thursday, September 16, at 7:00 c/t. Interestingly, the site also names some of the contestants. If you want to check it out,  urlLink clickhere .  Anyways, it's time to fill you in on what happened on Last Comic Standing and Big Brother 5.  Big Brother 5: Lori, Will, and Karen plotted to have Holly evicted. However, Jase won the Power of Veto (PoV) and he used it to take Holly off the nominee list, forcing Marvin (who is Head of Household) to choose another person to put up for eviction. Marvin decided to put up Lori's best friend Karen up for eviction. It's obvious that either Lori - who's currently up for eviction - or Karen will be evicted on the Thursday, July 22, episode. I predict that Lori will get evicted because she already won $10,000. Scott and Diane are becoming fast enemies. Scott insulted Diane in yesterday's episode, making her cry. I hope he gets evicted soon.  Last Comic Standing: Kathleen Madigan, Gary Gulman, Tammy Pescatelli, Alonzo Bodden, and John Heffron have all made it into the final five! Tammy won immunity, reserving a spot for herself there. The eliminated comics (Bonnie McFarlane, Todd Glass, Ant, and Jay London) all voted with the current comics for whom they wanted to see do a Head-to-Head (H2H) match. John and Corey Holcomb had to do the H2H match. But, there was a twist: the H2H match was actually going to be a H2H2H match! Meaning that another remaining comic had to go H2H with both John and Corey, also facing a possible elimination. The comics all voted again, and Alonzo had the most votes. John, Corey, and Alonzo all did their acts in front of the audience, and Alonzo garnered 55% of the votes. John got 38% of the votes from the audience, leaving Corey with the remaining 7%. Corey was eliminated from the contest. Now, the show's format seems to be similar to that of American Idol's. The comics have to perform their acts to America (maybe even LIVE), and WE get to vote for whom we like best. We watch the comics perform their acts and vote for whom we liked best on Tuesdays at 7:00 c/t, and the winners will be revealed on Thursdays at 8:00 c/t. LCS's Wild Card Show will air at 8:00 c/t on Tuesday, July 27.
