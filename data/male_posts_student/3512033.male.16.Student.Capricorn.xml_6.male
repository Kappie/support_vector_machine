(huge sigh of relief)  however, this is not all good news, as now it seems that i probably have to go back to normal schooling... starting 8:10 thursday morning... how am i ever going to get back into the routine of full days at school?!?   oh well, at least i have the long weekend to look forward to!  thats right... queen's birthday weekend... such an australian concept.   "hey, i feel like a holiday..."  "i have an idea! lets make up an extended weekend in commemoration of the birth of some old bird we couldn't really care less about!"   yes, the queen... noone in australia really recognizes the british monarch as having anything to do with our country, because, lets be frank... she doesn't.  but that is no reason why we shouldn't get a free day off work... to not take a holiday would be unaustralian...  i love my country...  onto my next story...   (note: that was called a "linking sentence"... my english teacher says i should use these so my essays flow more fluently... but back to the story...)  well, it seems like this blog has sprouted a lot of small projects for me...  the first is the background... and yes... i haven't forgotten, i just haven't managed to get around to it between my playing pool and watching anime...  this project means i will need to learn how to use photoshop pretty well, which didn't seem too hard at first... but that program has sooooo many buttons!  The second began as a sort of offshoot of this... while consulting one of my many geeky (yet fairly cool please don't attack me with parcel bombs) friends on how this site worked.   Well, somehow he decided to start abusing me for the fact that my site was not pure xhtml, and that i should fix it...   so i have taken his advice, and decided to at least gain a knowledge of programming (or writing html, because technically html is not a code for making programs, but only for marking up static pages - see i'm learnig already!), to the extent that i can at least understand 3% of all the bullshit he was feeding me...   seriously, who really cares if some geek on a freeware operating system can't see my page in the way it is intended? not me!! hahaha... stupid cheap geeks..  anyway... i am deciding to gain a simple knowledge of writing html, just for the fact that i can say that i can... it might make me sound smart :)  and lets face it... chicks dig smart blokes... hehehe...  toodaloo! see you next time!
