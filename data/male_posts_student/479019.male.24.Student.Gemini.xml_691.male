Some random thoughts:  Classes were ok today. I think some poor girl left her purse on the bench at the bus stop and now there's an empty purse hanging on the bench. Sometimes you see and then think things about people that bum you out. I want good seafood (so maybe I will go out of town for Thanksgiving). Food is important. I sleep too much. I need to get shit done.   ***
