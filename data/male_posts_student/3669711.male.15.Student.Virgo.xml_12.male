Well, it seems like they have been billing us 62 dollars each time we have been billed.  The standing price is supposed to be around 24 dollars a month.  Where is all the extra cost comming from?  Could they bill us for two months at a time, plus tax?  I'm not sure, but if it was two months at a time, it would come out to around 57 dollars ($50 + $7 tax).  That still misses around $5.  Could they be charging me extra for using too much bandwidth?  I'm not sure.  I don't seem to remember downloading too much, or using the internet too much. Heck, for the whole time i've been using it, i haven't even been home for half of the day.  Quite frankly, i've quite puzzled, and I'm not sure what to think.  I do like the service, its dependable, you get a free e-mail account, of which i use, and the modem looks pretty cool (eye candy, lol).  But this bill is a bit much.  I know i don't pay for it personally, but i would still like to know where it's comming from.  This is quite frusterating.  Lates
