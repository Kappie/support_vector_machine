I wish i was back at Japan, in the good ol dayz, but naw...im here and tryin to make the best of thingz. But that isnt even workin out...lately ive been on a slump in vball, i aint gettin the killz im use to gettin during the beginning of the season, but i have been gettin a lot of digz though. I jus have to push myself even harder to get the killz i used to get now, cuz they r startin to put like 2 or 3 blockerz on me, so i have to utilize my tipz and try to hit it in certain spotz instead of jus poundin the shit out of the ball and hittin it straight down, maybe against rio mesa i will get a chance to pound the ball, but against camarillo, it might b a little tough.   yea right...   urlLink Nobodyz Listenin
