The story keeps you on the edge, and you want to play more and more to find out what will happen next, the action is intense but the adjusting difficulty keeps the gameplay managble. If you haven't played this yet, you MUST rent it! It would be good to play through the first one first though because it will help you get used to the gameplay and the strategies to do good, BUT Max Payne 2 has a feature that will summarize the first game's plot to set you up for the second part.  Anyway I'm pretty tired right now....listening to Nirvana- The Man Who Sold the World (Unplugged) which is a pretty cool song. I think tonight I'm going to play Delta Force: Land Warrior abit......I wish I had some mountain Dew or something, LOL I need the caffiene, I had a loooong week and really don't feel like going to bed so early.  Well c-ya, -haze-
