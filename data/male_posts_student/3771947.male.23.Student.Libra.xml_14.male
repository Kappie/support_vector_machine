McGrady's -> local Bethlehem Irish pub located on 3rd street.  Lehigh University hang out.  22 beers on tap.  Tuesday is wing nite 1.50/10 wings and $3 pitchers.  Well last nite...  Wow, allot of tactical mistakes, as Andy would say. Dave was definitely the star clown making me the sidekick in an all out "mcgrady's brothers circus."  It kind of reminded me of the scene in American Pie, where the dork girl tells the dork guy, "say my name bitch."  Thing's learned:  1)Do not buy girls drinks - Dave out $80. 2)Do not chase girls - Dave used and home alone. 3)definitely make conversation - he who hesitates, masturbates. 4)Do not call people at 2:15 AM asking them to "hang out" - Dave considered a scumbag loser who couldn't find a girl at the bar. 5)The locals suck. 6)Angry wierdo's can still be useful - one bought me a drink. 7)Shots bad - beer good. 8)Dress like a college student at a college bar - Dave, you have been there before, it is not my job to analyze every outfit of yours before we leave.  Dave= DUG (dressed up guy) 9)The popcorn is addicting.  Every nite out is training.  Each time I learn something new.  Yea, Dave might not have had wild crazy sex, but he taught me about women.  What to do and what not to.  Learning by watching is always better than learning by listening.    The nite was going good, nice crowd, no bomshells, but what you expect on a Tuesday?  I'm talking to someone anyway so, not "hawking" right now.  So I start talking to some friends when Dave gets the bright idea to have a "drinking contest" and I drunkenly decide the alcohol is on us.  Big mistake.  Dave gets some girl who keeps walking up to him and saying "where's my shot." (American Pie) Dave is now totally being used for free alcohol and is to drunk to put the slut in her place.  I am all over the place; talking to random KU teachers and angry drunk kids and guys who look like they just left the hospital...  Dave nearly clubs this girl and drags her home, but wait, she was just using him.  Oh well.  Maybe Thursday Dave will get some ass.
