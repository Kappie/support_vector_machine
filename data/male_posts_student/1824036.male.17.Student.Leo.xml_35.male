Hey, Pedro...how old were you when the very first WrestleMania took place in 1985 at MSG?  Nevermind, don't answer that....   The original  urlLink WrestleMania  was the biggest gamble ever made in the wrtestling industry.  Vince McMahon jr. was betting everything on taking his newly bought enterprise nationwide, and if it hadn't been for Mr. T, he may well have failed.    But we all know at this point that The Higher Power, Vince, has suceeded quite well since that great gamble in 1985.  And come this 14th of March, 2004 AD, we'll see the 20th installment of the true Grandaddy of 'em all.  From what I understand, Vince usually starts planning the next WrestleMania about a month after the previous.  Meaning for XX, Vince had something in mind as of last May.  If only our weekly RAW and SmackDown! shows were so well booked...  Usually, they like to start the WM Countdown at the Royal Rumble.  Who knows whats in store this year.  I have some guesses though...   Did you expect anything less?    Kane vs. Undertaker  -- Of course this is a foregone conclusion.  I was originally thinking that it would be a Hell in a Cell match.  Then again, I'd like to see those creative geniuses come up with something new and more brutal.  Like a barb-wire-flaming cage match, or something.  Rest assured, it'll be a gimmick match.  let's hope it'll be something we've never seen before.  And then there's the deep speculation...  Goldberg's contract negotiations are up in the air from what I've read, but let's assume for the moment that it's all bullshit.  If Golddus..Goldberg sticks around for a WrestleMania paycheck, he'll face Brock Lesnar.  As a Lesnar mark, and a Goldberg hata, I would love to see that match.   John Cena  is getting a huge push, and I gotta say, I'm diggin' it...sucka!!!  Word life!  My boyz going to WrestleMania/and his opponent there aint no savin' ya/ Jericho might say your're an ass clown/but Cena's gonna beat ya down/it don't matta who stands toe to toe with word-life/John Cena's gonna beat them worse HHH's wife/It don't matta who steps around cuz they aint it/Cena knows it stanks cuz he's  THA SHIT!!!   They say Bret Hart is going to be there.  We also  KNOW that Shawn Micheals is going to be there.  Could we possibly see a handshake and a hug over the Montreal Screwjob??  (I'll write about this in the future, but the Montreal Screwjob was the most genius work ever pulled...).  They say Hulk Hogan will be there.  As well as the Macho Man Randy Savage.  Back in the day, I was the ultimate MM mark, but now he's just pathetic.  Have you heard his new rap CD?  No?  Well, shit,  urlLink click this link , clear out the popups, and let the Macho Man tell you what you need to do, oooh yeah!  Kurt Angle's neck may prevent him from ever wrestling again, but I hope he'll at least make anther WM match, perhaps against Shelton Benjamin.  Shelton is just a winning gimmick away from being The Next Big Thing.  I'm rambling here, Pedro.   Ask me about WM XX after the Royal Rumble.
