Although I have to admit that I've learned and experienced sooooooo much in the last three years.  And Here is a little vivid memory from my three days of AP tests in as many days: "Remember, the Multiple Choice questions may NEVER be discussed in any shape or form with ANYONE at ANYTIME, failure to do so may result in the invalidation of grades and possible legal actions for COPYRIGHTS VIOLATION!"  Yeah you realize from the AP test experience how much your mind has been trained to memorize stuff........because i've literally memorized the whole AP instruction script by now.   I'll see all you guys tomorrow, the only day I'll be in school for two weeks.
