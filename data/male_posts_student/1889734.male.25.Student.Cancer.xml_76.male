DOWD: And that means our leaders have used goofball logic and lousy assumptions to trap the country in a cockeyed replay of the Crusades that could drain our treasury and strain our military for generations, without making us any safer from terrorists and maybe putting us more at risk.  Me:  The Crusades!?!?!?  She's invoking the Crusades??  Are we conquering the land and killing the Muslim to make way for Christianity?  Are we 'reclaiming the Holy Land'??  This is just over the top!  DOWD: Iraq never threatened U.S. security. Bush officials cynically attacked a villainous country because they knew it was easier than finding the real 9/11 villain, who had no country. And now they're hoist on their own canard.  Me:  DOWD doesn't get it.  Like I said earlier, 9/11 was the catalyst that started this fight.  It is not the reason we continue the fight.  She is so full of hatred, and I think she would prefer to see an American failure rather than a safer world.
