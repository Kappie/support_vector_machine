The first one i made by myself, and it was my first song so bite me, punk. It goes for 1 min 23 seconds, and is about 1.3 meg. I'm not sure how to make it so you can download it but if you ahve quicktime you should be able to stream it just by cliking on it   Song #1   This one i made with jess is better and goes for 13 seconds. It is about 300Kb   Song #2
