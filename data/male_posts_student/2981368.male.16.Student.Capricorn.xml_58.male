"The Flyers are quite sure about the status of their own injured star defenseman, Eric Desjardins. After returning from a broken right arm to play the final three games of the regular season, Desjardins is out for the entire playoffs after the metal plate protecting his injured limb broke on Tuesday while he was playing catch with his son."  Hes an ice hockey defenseman. Every few days, he goes out there and bodychecks people. Thats his job. Then he injures himself  playing catch .   And for those of you who haven't seen a playoffs series before, this is how it works: The first 4 games are set. 2 at one teams rink, 2 at the others. If one team wins these 4 games, the other possible 3 games aren't needed, as it would end up 4-3 if the other team won them all. So they're pointless. But most the time these go to the 6th or 7th (final) game before they're decided. Whoever wins goes through to the next round, and you end up with an Eastern and a Western division champion. These 2 then play in a series as the big final. Which could mean a maximum of 32 more games for the division champs.  Anyways, Devils/Flyers will probably go right to the 7th. Its gonna be a close 'un.
