I lifted weights afterwards and am now here at my computer typing endless, worthless knowledge. When I took my sock off, my middle toe was covered in blood (but it didn't hurt)! The movie I really want to see now is the Dodgeball one - it looks hilarious. Oh, I get my learners permit either today or tomorrow. Stay off the roads!

Did you know that 68.4% of all stats are made up.
