I felt like I was better than they were. At that time, I believed with all my heart that I was destined for great things.  By the time I reached fourth year, this belief had not changed. I was inadvertedly placed in the crème de la crème of the seven fourth year sections in DPS. At first I felt like I must provide some separation. I remember thinking, "You people are nerds. I am not. I am smarter than any of you, but I have a life.Bow before thine master, grovel at mine feet." For a while, this presupposed niche and I got along rather well. Classes always seemed a bit dry, so I took it upon myself to provide the comic relief every so often. After all, I was from the non-star section and damn proud of it; how else wouldthese nerds survive? I really felt like I was shaking things up, and in a way, I did. (though my opinion of my classmates in general had changed over time; I discovered I was a bigger nerd than any of them would ever be, and that was ok with me)  However, the path to greatness is laden with a large number of hindrances, and I have come across a large number of them. First, my sole objective during fourth year was to make it into UP, a goal that was largely motivated by some of the greatest minds I have encountered in this life. I made it all right, but it seemed I had overestimated my intelligence. I had not made it into my first choice, BAA; rather, I got into my second choice, BS Math. Yes, 'tis a cruel, cruel fate that has befallen me, a lowly math major, an infinitesimal, insignificant speck in this vast cosmic fabric whereupon we exist. The foundations of my plans and schemes had all come crashing down. No longer could I be an accounting lawyer, thus, I would no longer be as wealthy as I could have been. No longer will major corporations line up to snag the brilliant head resting uponmine neck and between mine shoulders. Now I must prove to everyone that I can make it anyway, despite fate's derailing of my train ride to greatness. Ah, the price of extreme cockiness and arrogance! Oh, woe is me, woe is me!  I once told my sister that I believed myself to be destined for greatness. She replied by mentioning that everybody believed that, but that was not always the fruit of their labor. Only now do I see the truth in her words; everyone, but everyone, wishes to be great, but only ahandful ever make it to the glimmering pot of gold found at the rainbow's end. Truth be told, great men do not even seek greatness outright; they merely find it through the course of their actions. Oh dear... How very, very lost am I...  In the end, though I wish, hope anddream, the sad reality remains: I'll be fortunate to find work in a call center (given my sociopathic nature, I do not believe such a task would be bearable). My friends all around me will move on to become lawyers, doctors, celebrities, broadcasters, etc. all people working in very lucrative dealings, while I, I with my cynical outlook, my rebellious nature, my pseudo-realistic approach to all things, shall be truly blessed if anyone finds my corpse, my melancholy, tormented, peaceful expressionon my pallid, lifelessface.  When I die, will they mourn? Will they care? Will they even know? But then, none of that matters anymore. Death is the end to which all means must inevitably succumb. It can be rather liberating and peaceful when you think about it. Why must I continue to exist anyway? What do I live for? Who do I live for? The answers to these questions elude me still.  Smile while you still can, or while it still stands for the good,anyway. Know that it is not at all times that a smile will be symbolic of joy, of ecstsy, of bliss. Even men who are dying in extreme and utter torment can find the time to smile because of the absurdity of it all...  completely wrong thought of the day: It would be so simple, so easy. It all could end if I truly willed it so. Is it not better to quit while I'm ahead, while they still believe that I am capable of something, before they are awakened to the sad reality that my life or death will be of no difference to anyone at all? At least I am certain that there are still those who would mourn; wait too long and they all might outlive me. Yes, I do not know what I am missing, but I know this: there will be no morepain. There will be only silence, calmness, tranquility...  If only things were different. If only this were not our sad and twisted realm. If only this were some bizzare parallel universe, where things were different, where it were at least possible... how I wish. If that were so, then maybe, just maybe... or perhaps...  Forgive me. I am a fool who knowsnotthat of which he speaks. Forget all that I said; it is irrelevant. But ah, yes, one must remember in order to forget... and for this, again I apoplogize.
