She called yesterday saying who i'm i talking too and she said "You wish you never met me right?" and i was like "no" but i was all sad, i felt like crying again, but the truth is that i do feel sad and the truth is that it is her fault. I don't know why she is surprised i wrote her that email. I really don't like to make her feel bad but is only me who thinks about her all day long, sometime i even get lost nowhere just thinking about her, and she doesn't understand, i hate to know that she is with him. And like today, i didn't go to the lake just because i don't want to see them together, i'll just start crying. And bofo is like "Are you going to stop going all places just cause they are going to be there?" And maybe he is right i shouldn't stop going places because of them, but i can't right now i know i'll make the night a bad one anyways. Maybe im selfish and i don't let her be happy, but the truth that's how i feel right now, i don't want her to be happy with him.
