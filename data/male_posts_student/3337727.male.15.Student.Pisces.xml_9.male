Yesterday Colleen told me that she thought me and her were closer when we were just friends..and she told me she still isn't over Artem yet. She only wants to be friends. I didn't act all moody and angsty towards her, and supported her decision..but I've just got this huge emptiness of a feeling inside me. :S
