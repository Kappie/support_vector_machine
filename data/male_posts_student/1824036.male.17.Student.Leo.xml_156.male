Tomorrow is the last day of school and he decided to make cookies for everyone that sits at his lunch table.  urlLink Zach  and I were bored so after playing some video games we went to  urlLink Hy-Vee  to talk to Sam Bendixen...for no aparent reason. After buying some  urlLink Mt. Dew , it was off to  urlLink Chad 's house!! As we went into the parking lot... urlLink Chad  was just walking into  urlLink Hy-Vee . That was when we figured out he was making cookies.  I would compare him to  urlLink Emeril Lagasse
