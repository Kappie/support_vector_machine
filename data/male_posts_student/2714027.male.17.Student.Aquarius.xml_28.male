Strolling down the road, I noticed a Porche 911 Turbo on my right - nice car. "One day", I thought, "I'll drive something like that." Fast and comfortable, something to be proud of; that would be great. "What else do I want out of life?" I pondered. "To settle down with a wife and a couple of kids, with a job that's well paid, rewarding and enjoyable." A tall order, you might think, but achievable. How I'll get there isn't quite so clear, but I will someday.  Onwards to the bus stop and walking through the main shopping area of the town I'm reminded that tomorrow is Valentines' Day.  Sex, love, hearts, red, flowers, buy this, buy that, consume, love, again, again, buy more, buy it now or you woun't get sex, love, hearts, flowers...  On and on, repeatedly. Now Valentines is a good idea, but the commercialisation of it all is too overwhelming for me.  Strolling on, I noticed a greasy-looking teenager walking towards me down the street. Dressed like a.....well, the looked like a prat, let's just say that.....and holding hi-fi on one shoulder with some crap 'music' blaring out at full volume, he was a reminder of what can happen if you don't aim high and work at achievieving your aims. Nike say 'Just Do It' and they're damn right. There are doers and there are talkers, and I'd like to think that I'm becoming more of a doer every day. 'Learning by doing' is also another favourite phrase that I've picked up and it couldn't be truer.
