It bit a whole branch of one off and then acted all territorial when I chased it off. Yep, that mangy cat is goin' down! Seriously, I don't take kindly to animals that just chew stuff for no reason. I mean it's not like cats usually eat plants or anything. If I were to just randomly put a dead carcass out on my patio, well then I'd expect some cats to come snooping around, but plants? What the hell?! I wonder if cats are afraid of owls. I could find one of those decoy owls to stick on my patio; maybe that would keep the cat away. I'm not too sure about wheather owls would scare 'em. If anybody knows please email me. However, I'm pretty sure that cats are afraid of getting shot in the ass with a BB gun, but I don't think my neighbors would take to kindly to me shooting my gun around dinnertime. I'm just going to have to poison the SOB.   Songs of the day  Toto,  Africa , 1982.  Badly Drawn Boy,  Silent Sigh , 2002.
