They are so fark-up and i hate them. Wad a bunch of ass. The captain like shit. Whoever one of my boys reading this, hope u tell the others. They said that i create the team but i can't have a say in any matter. Wad a fark rite. Nvrmind lar, fuck those farkfaces. I don't care 'bout them anymore. Once i get my jersey numered 11, i'm going to quit for good. Later, i'll post a pic of a boy that i hate most. Fuck his ass lar, curry sauce. They think they so good. Juz now training, feel like beating him up sia. All play like fuck. No teamwork. My bo's team better. Nvrmind bout them. No mood to talk much...i mean type. Bye :(    He's the one in the green waga jersey untying his boot. I'm the one with the spiderman game.
