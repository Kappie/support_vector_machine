He ssays that the worse part is that you have to take your bath in a wheel chair while someone cleans you. lol. then we started playing with the monitor XD when takes a deep breath, the monitor goes all the way up. and then when he exhales, it goes all the way down. im planning to stay with my grabdpa on friday, its better than my life. hoho. o yea, i had to wait for my mom outside the hospital (cuz only two persons can be in, and my uncle was in, so we couldnt go in all of us at the same time (did u actually understand that?) so i was waiting outside the street and people looked at me like if i was some sort of threat (maybe its true). well, i sat down ar the other side of the street, and a guy with a disorbited eye and something sticking out of his chest came up to me and asked for money. i knew he waas not into drugs, so i gave him what i had. actually, it was nothing, i feel like crap now, i only gave the guy 150 colones, but thats all i had at the moment (argh) well, then he gave me a speech about how grateful he was, and may god help me and i was like: "i only gave u 150 man. if i had more id give you more sorry." and then he continued with the speech, and started to walk aimlessly across the park (the park is in front of the hostpital) and asked people for money. then another guy came and asked: "why are you sitting there, kid?" and i said: "im waiting for my mom" "did u already make the line?" "um... no ive got an entry card" (and  i showed a white cardboard paper, with lots of things written on it) "good... good... take care kid..." and then he walked on.... so i stayed there looking around (specially at the policemen who were working on a crash, they had been there for around two hours) and then a face popped out of nowhere so i was really scared and.. "hey, is your uncle in?" "yes mom." and then we walked in to the hospital, while we both saw the drunken cop on the entrancee of the hospital. what an amazing experience. and i talked to him more "hi im back" "hi! hows things outside?" "um... the same as it has always been. grandma woke up with a cold today" "really?" "yea" and then we both looked at the monitor and then stared outside the room, and didnt talk for a long while.  "and.. um.." "hmm?" "sigh" "......" "......." "....................................................................................................................................." and then my uncle went into the room: "ok lets go, good bye dad" "bye grandpa" "bye" and then i looked at him. I dont think he'll survive the operation thats why im going there on friday.  ARGH where are my hedphones?!? i lended them
