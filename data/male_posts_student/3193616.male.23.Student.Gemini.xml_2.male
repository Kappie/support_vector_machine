Completely analytical and devoid of any jingoistic ideological baggage. the author has taken a very good view of ground realities and given a good analysis of the options available to the  urlLink BJP . the  urlLink Congress  any way has made it very easy for its future leaders- read rahul or priyanka or both to adorn the mantle of leadership without any thing hindering their image. But India is engaged in singing the praise of Sonia that it has no time to think of any thing else.when the entire nation speaks something you need guts to speak the opposite and the auhtor seems to have it in abundance. i think  urlLink IE  would be the only newspaper to have it.
