Even though I knew that the storyline had no backbone, it was still better than going into a sleeping room with the music teams. So yes... My very professional comments on the performance:    Storyline -- The storyline is a failure. Anybody and everybody could see that. But this was meant mostly for inter-school fun, so the storyline doesn't exactly matter. The author of the script is definitely not a thinker.    Script(dialogue) -- Amidst a sea of puns and witty comments, the script wasn't exactly too smooth flowing. It was really good enough for a school performance like that, just that it wasn't perfect. The witty asides are what's best in the script, and this is where most of the Drama Club sriptwriting skills shine. For the simple and nonsensical storyline, the script was almost too good.    Characters -- The characters in the script are absolutely perfect. Each one represents the typical, overboard NS men often talked about. The Nerd, the Macho, the "on" one, the totally queer one, the "good future" one, and the "cannot live without home" one. Sadly, the very interesting subject of Malay logic was not touched on. Malays are one of the main components of army life, without whom theNS experience is not complete. With a repetition of the "nerd" and the "good future", I really don't see why they couldn't do a dim-witted Malay. Super extreme cliches work well with the nonsensical storyline,but incomplete experience just makes the cast a little less than perfect.   Entertainment value -- Why do people watch comedies? To let loose, and have fun. With the flimsy storyline, the entertainment value had better be up there above perfection. Yes... Very much laughable, but definitely not high-level humour. After a while, the humour became very much corny and overused. I still do like the parts where the actors break into absolutely ridiculous and out of point dances. Their ability to incorporate a little musical influence really impressed me. It was the most highly intellectual humour in the whole script.  Overall rating: Good, but not rememberable. 3/5!
