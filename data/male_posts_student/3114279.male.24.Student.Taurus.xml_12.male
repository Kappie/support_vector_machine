      It seems there have been some new terms being thrown around that I did not previously know about.  These are new terms to me, well, new as in I've only heard them as of this year.  I don't live in an urban area, and though I visit an urban area often, and other larger cities, I live in a smaller town, so the hip bullshit takes a little longer to get to me.  That is also due to me not watching MTV or getting on chatrooms, or whatever.  Back in January, after spilling my soul to a friend of mine about my romantic troubles, she says to me "Maybe you are  urlLink QuirkyAlone !"  QuirkyAlone I guess is someone too neurotic or insecure or just plain strange to be in a relationship.  Or maybe that's just in my case.  I did some research, and I guess it is people who are not into the dating as sport kind of thing, or just getting into a relationship just because that's the thing to do, etc. etc.  I'm on board with that, I suppose.  I'd never heard of that, and most of my "big city" friends hadn't heard of that either.  Apparently there is a big movement or QuirkyAlones.  Then a guy friend of mine accused me of being a " urlLink metrosexual ".  I had never heard this before, and I was offended.  I went and looked up the definition, and I was still offended.  Basically this is a gay guy who is straight.  I have some macho and some typical male in me.  Just because I am more sensitive and sentimental and introspective and neat and emotional and... Okay. I guess I am on board with that too.  Isn't this whole metrosexual thing in vogue now?  Don't girls like that kind of thing these days?  And aren't girls attracted to loners?  So I should have a lot going for me at this point.
