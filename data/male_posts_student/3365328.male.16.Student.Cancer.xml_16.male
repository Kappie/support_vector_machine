Having aquired my stylish suit only the day before, I was dropped off to find most people already there. Many people had come in big flashy limos that all looked the same and so they were already in an ecstatic mood. When I got there, I found I fitted right in as everyone was wearing suits and dresses, with the exception of a couple of 70s pimp outfits. So we all met up and chatted, before eventually filing in. The main area was generally dimly lit with a dance floor in the middle and chairs round the sides, but the DJ made sure it was well-illuminated with crazy flashing lights.  My intention was to hang around by the side of the dance floor chatting to everyone, but after a few songs and watching loads of other people do the same thing, my plan collapsed entirely and I started dancing for quite a while. In fact, I can't even remember how many people I danced with...I at least remember these though: I danced with Lauren (pictured  urlLink  here  on the right), who could inject a huge amount of energy into even a funeral, Lucie (also  urlLink pictured  far right), after Richard (again, picture urlLink  here  ) executed his sneaky plan of breaking up a whole group of girls, Jessica, who dragged me off the side for about 30 seconds, Vicky (pictured  urlLink  here  bottom left), with whom I took the piss out of every black american artist that was played (and Eminem), and who refused to let me go for about 7 songs, even when her friends started dragging her off ;) (not that I was complaining), and then Lauren and Laura at the same time...I was in demand, I tell you. ^_^  After dancing continually for ages and managing to lose my jacket in the process, I finally ran out of energy and had to sit down for the last half-hour feeling very strange. I started chatting to people again, and by the last song Lauren had got me singing a duet of 'Angels' with her, so my time wasn't comletely wasted. Then, everyone began to leave, I found my jacket on the other side of the room on a chair, and I said some goodbyes to various people who hadn't disappeared too quickly. I regret not bringing my camera, as I'd have loved to get some pictures of it all, but with any luck some people who did can scan in a few for me. I also didn't get to dance with everyone as much as I'd liked to either, but that's physical limitations for you. The whole evening was immensely enjoyable nonetheless, though, and a brilliant way to end our secondary school lives.
