Fairly decent, good considering I haven't ran since the summer when I pulled my back and I didn't stretch before I ran today. Ok so school went by, and after school no drums...I went to play some homerun derby with Heaton and my brother Paul behind Paul's at the tabernacle. Of course Paul won. Then to Quiznos. It was Heaton's birthday and I'm just plain old special so Paul bought us Quiznos. On the way home Paul and I discussed elementary memories (songs we sang in chorus and plays) and how awesome the summer is gonna be. Today was a reflection of the greatness of this summer. Damn I can't wait. This time I'll actually go to the beach more than 3 times. Ok this day really kicked ass. My dad's all happy again because I showed him my 3.75 average on my report card, told him about me getting picked in AP Euro to debate over this Soviet Union thing, and I played my NYSSMA solo for them and they were both shocked. I love my life sometimes. Also I was watching the end of Grease. My sister has been watching it everyday ever since she bought it the other day on dvd, such a random movie especially for her age...8 years old. Her friend has it so she's gotta too. That movie can make anyone happy. It's like what Mr. Ferrante said, the time of Detante, when people acted all happy go nutz with their happy movies and happy days in the ol neighborhood to ignore the Cold War. Man, I sometimes wish I lived long back then. Back then there were no people walking around worshipping Satan with spikes coming out of their backpacks and no wannabe gangsters, if you were a gangster, you were a true gangster. Now today wankstas just confuse our society by pretending their in gangs. Yea what's their gang, SUPERSOAKER GANG. Full of millions of wankstas who act all tough and then hold their mom's hand when there's no friends around. Well, my life kicks ass. I'm me. I'm myself. Nobody can change that.
