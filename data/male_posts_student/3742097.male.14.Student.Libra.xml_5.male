So I was sitting down at dinner and my dad broke his bridge, his false teeth but only his top front four, and he called his dentist who didn't get back to him until 10 tonight. So my dad left as soon as he got the call, and he isn't back yet.  Then, yet again, I went somewhere with my grandfahter. But he hurt his back putting in heating improvments to his house. And he took pills, but he didn't know that they would make him sleepy. And on the ride he commented to me about how I don't do anything (duh, it's summer) so he wants me to get a job. And I agree with him. But then my days of sleeping until 12 will be scarce. Oh well, I will be living it up in all the money that I will have. Muhaha.   And today I got more heat from my parents with my attitude. They want me to respect them more. Well I told my dad this, You two will get respect after you stop yelling at me and calling me things like stupid, asshole, and a bastard. Why should they get my respect?  And the fight for High Speed Internet was lost, my dad said to me, why do you need it? And I gave up and said that I didn't need it. So my fight turned to Cable TV. (Yes, I don't have either) But I wont win that because only my dad works and he doesn't want or need another bill to pay.  Right now I am making Jalepeno Poppers. I forgot that I was making them and my mom yelled to me, "James, the oven is ready." Oops. But who can blame me? I was writing this very post. :-D  BTW I am listening to a song I got 24 hours ago and I have played it 36 times already. MY top song is Last Year's Nest by Boy Sets Fire. Yeah, I know, they are the communist band whose CD I blindly bought. Check out these  urlLink lyrics  for a different song, I found them....interesting.   I suppose this is enought for one day. But 12 is only 1 hour and 16 minutes away. And plus, my Jalepeno Poppers are almost done.
