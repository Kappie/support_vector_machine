I felt like such a man.  Two guys giving their experience to a younger guy so he can look after his family.  It was a rite of passage, like an Indians first hunt.  By owning power tools I am now a man.  Incredible.  I have been struggling to reason why gays should have the right to marriage.  After this weekend I have a better understanding.  If I had two moms, I would never have gone through that rite of passage for a young man, the registering of power tools.  I realize that we are all equal, but still different.  Man and woman are different, and those differences are fine, it doesn't mean they are not equal.  However, you are robbing children of valuable experiences unique to their gender by not having a mom and dad.  I still need to think about giving them some rights of married couples.
