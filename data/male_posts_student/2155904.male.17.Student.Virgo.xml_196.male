Waking up on his own before 11 was a bit of a surprise since Tyke was expecting that he would just be asleep for a really long time.  He did almost nothing all day.  At 12 something he and his mom talked about some stuff.  Mainly school.  Tyke has to talk to Gretch on Monday and really that doesn't mean anything.  What he really has to do is figure out what he can tell his mom that will assuage her troubled mind and at least somewhat make his situation calmer.  Right now he is wishing that he didn't sorta tell his mom that he has turned in every assignment this semester.  Cuz that definitely isn't true and will most likely end up hurting him.  He is gonna have to bring up that fact because he can't risk his mom finding out what his grade was last semester.  It is going to be tough to make sure that doesn't come up.  But if he really gives his mom the details of his current situation that should help him out.  Cuz she knows that Tyke isn't working now.  Now he just has to keep her from knowing the rest of his follies.  Luckily, the only things that Tyke has to hide from his parents (mother really) is his schoolwork.  He doesn't do drugs, drink, or have sex so he has nothing else to be worried about.  It's too bad though that the deficiency did come home.  It would have been much easier to just have his poor grades come home in the summer and either not have them be seen or just tell them that he didn't work at all second semester.  At least then she couldn't find out any other bad things about his schoolwork.  Now she could.  And it's not like Tyke can do much with the last 15 days of school.  Stupid school.  Making Tyke not have fun.  And he still hasn't really started his speech yet.  He needs to start tonight on it.  Right after that conversation he was invited to a little bball game so he joined in on that at Cougar Ridge.  Tyke showcased his talents early on but he lost his touch as the games progressed.  And (as Tyke dances to Night Fever) he also lost focus.  Tyke, Amed, Dr. Phil, Piggy J, K-Caj, and Macaroon were the players and all but K-Caj talked about prom after the games were over.  They just sorta chatted about it, not really deciding anything other than they probably will be taking quite a few cars.  At least 2 couples will be taking their own cars.  Tyke could of course but he won't since he is with Skippy.  Speaking of Skippy, he called today and they talked a little about prom.  But just dinner times and picture times.  So nothing all that cool.  Tyke wishes prom would just come though.  Cuz then a lot of stupid stuff would be over with.  And school would almost be over with.  Just a couple of finals and then graduation.  Damn, today was stupid.  Why can't fun times like Ashland last longer?  That was a short 4 days.  Tyke only has one more full week though...whoa, is that true?  It might be.  Memorial Day is off of course and he has half days coming up so yeah, this might be the last week.  Once his speech is over on Monday the day will be alright.  Actually, once lunch comes it will be a good day.  Cuz he will still be wearing his suit and then he gets to go get his tux which is gonna be fun.  And Purdy is coming so it will be more fun.  Sighhhh, suckygay right now.  It is also after 10 which means Tyke wants to go to sleep soon but he has to do some of his speech he thinks.  He really hates doing it all on Sunday.  He already has decided that the only thing he is doing on Sunday is Refuge though.  That's it.  And hopefully that is fun cuz it is the last one.  It is bring your parent night but Tyke doesn't think his mom will be coming and his dad won't be.  Not a great day.  But it is definitely a Bee Gees night again.  The Greatest Hits CDs are just so good.  They are perfect late night music.  Although alone they sorta lose some of the flavor.
