       
      So I made this up figuring it was a good place for people to see what is new, to ask questions or even just to laugh about old times (as well as post any links to old meet stuff)! I guess I'll start with the details of the upcoming meet:  Where: Trail/Fruitvale, BC, Canada When: Oct 8-11, 2004  If you are looking at flying in the closest airports are Castlegar and Trail.  Castlegar is serviced by  urlLink Air Canada  from Calgary and Vancouver and Trail is serviced by  urlLink Northern Hawk Air  from Vancouver only.  Coming from the UK, so far the cheapest flights I have found into Vancouver are with  urlLink Canadian Affair .  Again, you can also catch a ride with Jake/Camerak in Calgary or Steve/Lorax in Seattle. Flying into Spokane, WA is also an option.  Questions? :)  Enjoy!
