Man, that was a great day.  Tyke had to get up at 9:40 because he and his mom had some errands to run.  They went to Krispy Kreme and Starbucks before heading off to Redmond.  Tyke got his fedora for his Tolo outfit at a costume shop and then they left.  They had to go pick up Tyke's dad's car at Overlake Hospital after this.  Then Tyke went to Dotti's house but he got there early so he drove around South Cove for a while.  Then Dotti called him and said she wasn't going to be at her house but all of a sudden Tyke saw her drive by so he followed her to get gas.  Then they went to Sunset and met up with a bunch of the group and waited for the rest to finally come.  Tyke, Ekul, and Kramm formed The Outcasts by their own accord and that made for good times for the rest of the day.  As long as they were together then they were in good shape.  But Tyke was not in the same car as them so he was truly the outcast.  But it was still fun because Tyke and Dotti were together and the other two in the car were fine.  It could have been much worse.  The girls all got in their cars and drove the boys to Activity A which was kept secret from the guys.  Tyke made a guess on where they were going and as it turned out, he was right.  He definitely did not guess the exact place but he guessed the activity.  They went all the way out to Mukilteo for go-karting and other fun activities at this cool place.  Tyke did some rock climbing with Ekul and Purdy and Dotti got really high on the bouncy trampoline bungee jumping thingy.  That was fun but not even close to as fun as the go-karting.  Tyke had scouted out the track and cars with the other Outcasts earlier on and he decided he was going to go for car 6.  This car was probably the worst one out there but Tyke knew it.  Big Dog had been riding it (not a person anybody would know) and he certainly was a big dog.  But Tyke thought that if he could do well in that car then he could do well in anything.  Tyke had a little bit of trouble the first lap just getting used to the course.  It was a great course though.  There was a ramp that had a hill on it so you had to floor it going up the ramp in order to get over it.  But then when you hit the peak you immediately start going down so you get that rollercoaster feeling.  Which was not expected when Tyke first hit that part.  But Tyke had the third best lap time for his group so he did alright overall.  It was hella good times though.  After the long drive back home Tyke filled up his brother's car with gas and then he came home.  He got some nachos and dressed up in his outfit with the aid of his mom.  Then they took some pictures of him outside because it was such a gorgeous day and his parents weren't able to come to pictures at Haras' house.  Tyke left his house and went down to Dotti's to meet up with her.  They took a few pictures and then they went with her dad up to Haras' house.  Everybody met there and they took pictures with a bunch of the parents.  A lot of smiling and blinding flashes of course.  But the ladies all looked lovely in their flapper dresses and Tyke got to take pictures with a lot of them.  So it was fine.  Then they all left and some of the guys got blindfolded as they were secretly taken to their location for dinner.  Which ended up being Frederique's house.  They went to her garage which was made up kinda like a restaurant and had a jet engine basically heating it up.  The food was delightful.  The pasta was sooooo damn good.  Dotti's mom made it Tyke thinks.  It was incredible.  So they stayed there for a while before getting ready and leaving for the dance.  Tyke wasn't really pumped for the dance but it wasn't like he didn't want to go to it.  He just didn't think it would be the most fun part of the day, especially after go-karts.  The group got there and took their pictures and then went up to the dance.  Tyke became a dancing machine.  He was just making up insane dances and doing them.  He pretended like he was pulling a heavy rope that had something attached to it and then he saw the box and opened it and there was something inside it.  And it happened to be a cat...etc, etc.  Basically he was doing mime dancing.  But he enjoyed it.  And Dotti seemed to as well.  Tyke even danced with Tina that way for a while.  One of them would make up dance moves and the other one would do it right after.  It was a blast.  Of course the Outcasts stuck together as well though.  They stayed at the dance for a while.  Til about 11 and then they left.  They went to Frederique's again.  But first Tyke's car went to Dotti's and they changed.  Then Tyke and Dotti drove to Frederique's and they hung out in the restaurant/garage.  There was some delectible cheesecake there and Tyke devoured it.  It was a treat indeed.  Tyke talked with Dotti, Tina, Frederique, Ekul, Kramm, Haras, and Purdy.  Then everyone left and Tyke took Dotti home and came home himself.  It was about 12:40 when he got home so it wasn't that late really.  Then he got up at about 11 today and had to go to brunch at his cousin's house in South Cove because his aunt/uncle (no blood relation though) are moving to Florida now.  So they had a little going away thing.  It was pretty damn boring but that's ok.  Then Tyke came home and has been trying to find out what the hell is wrong with his computer.  Cuz something is definitely wrong.  The screen has lost the correct colors and the display is just really messed up.  Tyke can't wait til he gets to get his laptop for college.  Then things will be simpler.  However, Tyke won't just be able to download whatever the hell he wants cuz he has to be aware of viruses.  Unlike on the current computer where it is so "effed" up already that nothing worse could come of it.  Oh well.  Refuge, etc tonight.
