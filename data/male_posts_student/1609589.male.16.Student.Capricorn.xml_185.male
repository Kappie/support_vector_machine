I'll ask around tomorrow and over the weekend, but if noone wants to, there's no point in doing it alone.  Depression phase.... now.  . .. ... .... ..... ...... ..... .... ... .. .   Boy, that stops the boredom.  Yeah, anyway, if you wanna go as a blue man for halloween with me(might goto my church party if comeone from COA goes...), I'm all for it! Girls are welcome. Guess I should call it "blue person."
