I got a total of Â£3 in tips over the two days, plus today was paid at double time because it was a bank holiday, so that's good news at least.  Sunday was really a chillout day, just spent playing games, specifically  Star Wars: KotOR  and  Battlefield 1942 . This week though I have to knuckle down and get revising hard because almost all my exams are next week and I can't afford to screw them up. It's all a bit scary and I can't wait for it to be over!
