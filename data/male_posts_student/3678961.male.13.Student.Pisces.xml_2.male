When you first go there, you're greeted by a picture of an oven (t0wN iDi0t: What a wonderful oven.), as well as a pop-up window titled "SAVE HIM!!" containing the text "HELP I AM DROWNING!!". After you click on the oven, then you'll really be intrigued. On the next page, entitled "afg bbb bai bab adc aig bba baa adc ahd bab bab aef", there is the phrase "Asia Awaits". How lovely. Blame the Koreans. Following the phrase is a mass of garbled text. Select all of it, and paste it in Notepad with Word Wrap off. You will get:  "Alexander cut me. An oracle predicted me. A future king tied me. Say my name to clear your path."  It turns out that the answer is "Gordian". I learned this after a heavy dose of Google. So, if you haven't already, click on Asia Awaits. The username is "Alexander", and the password is the answer to the riddle, "Gordian".  On the next page is a Scandinavian import furniture truck. Click on it, and you will receive the following text in a new window. And its in a different language! Yay! It translates into "The boy will only die". Weird, huh? Now, the hex within the page says "To get to the next site, find the place where the boy last died". Now, we can infer that this probably relates to the drowning mentioned upon entering the site. More research about the picture's location and a drowning reveals that the boy drowned in IJsselmeer, Holland.  Now, you may be a little freaked out by the next page. The  urlLink next page  shows a rusted sign attached to a tree, with eerie background music playing, and is titled "HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?". If you let the background music file play once (I think once), a blank alert box pops up. Woah. Anyways, click on the sign. The window will close, and another page in another window will load, but first you need to type another password. WhatALovelyDrapeTheyMake. I have yet to figure that out.  All of this information can be found at  urlLink this page .
