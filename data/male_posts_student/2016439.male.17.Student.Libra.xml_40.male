Well, Christmas officially ended yesterday morning with the arrival of my ultra-cool new music composition software Sibelius 3!  I spent most of yesterday trying to make it work, but these computers...gaahh, we have 3 and yet it can only semi-work on one.  Sheesh!  But it's so awesome because now I can make mp3's out of my songs and make CD's and stuff like that.  I'm really excited.  I have to finish my revamp of  Pillow Songs  in the next eight days, so...ahhh!  Yeah.  But seriously, my aunt is the best auntie in the whole entire world because she's the one who bought the program for me.  No, you don't understand.  You see, the program costs over $700!!!  I never expected her to buy it even though she had expressed an earlier interest in doing so when she shought it was around $300-$400.  I seriously didn't think I could accept it, but knowing my aunt, she won't take it back.  I love Christmas.  I have to say, though, that one (or, actually, two) of my favorite gifts of the season was a letter from one of my old buddies from a Stanford summer school I attended.  One lives in Miami and the other right outside of Seattle, and I consider it amazing that I now have friends in literally all corners of the nation (Hawaii included).  I really miss them.  This past summer at Stanford was truly the experience of a lifetime, and the best summer I've ever had in my entire life.  Absolutely incredible.  I spent Christmas Eve and Day in Egypt.  Before you go getting all excited, it was Egypt, TX ;-)  How cool is that?  That's the big stomping ground of my family and has been for almost the last two centuries.  It was nice to see my family, some of whom I haven't seen since Thanksgiving and others since about a year-and-a-half ago.  I have a whole bushel of new little cousins, about 8 of them, between the ages of four months and three-and-a-half years.  It's strange, because I used to be the youngest one in my family, and there's about a three-year gap between the cousin closest in age who's older than me and about a ten-year gap between the cousin closest in age younger than me.  Now, I'm the one being looked up to instead of being the one looking up to someone (although I still do that).  Well, I'm off to go find a costume to wear for this New Year's Eve costume party I'm going to.  I hate going to costume parties, but I like the person, so...eh, well, it's the holiday season.  I can make sacrifices :-).
