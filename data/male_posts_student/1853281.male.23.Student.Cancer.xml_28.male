Oh am i sore though, my knee(the one that tells the weather) was not working yesterday, and today my legs were rubber. classes began semester is shaping up to be hell the two classes i have had so far have the professors i loathe. My british lit class is run by a verbally incontinent eccentric. His sentances have an odd cadence as he emphasizes certain words with no reason. His voice moves from a whisper to a shout in the same word, and he seems more concerned with assuring the students of his own profundity and vast experience of travel than he does with teaching us. What an ass. My other professor, in my early 20th cent american history class, oh god, he is so earnest and excited. I wonder if he has taught much before. And, the horror, he is treating this upper level course as if it were a 1000 level survey, and assuming the students are complete idiots. He is going to have a writing tutor come in to help us with our papers for god's sake! Don't take a 38000 level course if you can't write a paper and don't know what a primary document is. oh god what an idiot
