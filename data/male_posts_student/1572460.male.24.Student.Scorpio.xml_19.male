A classic example of a trilogy that became legendary with Part I -  urlLink The Matrix , quite disappointing after the sequel -  urlLink The Matrix Reloaded , and without doubt, an  urlLink absolute disaster  after Part III.  However, even after two hours of great atrocity watching Part III, I am not sure how Matrix still appeals to the  philosophical  minds, so much so that I now hear it deals with Hindu Philosophy (seems that the song that plays in the end credits of Part III are sanskrit shlokas), in addition to Christianity (you betcha, starring Neo as Christ "The One").  Check some expert comments  urlLink here .  If this philosophy crap was all that the Wachowski brothers wanted to put forth before the audience, then as a Matrix fan, I certainly need better philosophy lessons than The Matrix Revolutions.  Everything that has a beginning has an end. Thanks to the Wachowski brothers for ending these systemic anomalies once and for all.
