Alone Again Or is completely unlike anything they've done yet, and they're covering someone's work, I just can't tell who. It's odd, but good. Not as good as their other stuff, though.  Convict Pool is very solid, a great rhythm and some solid singing, even if the lyrics are a bit... awkward.  Si Tu Disais is one of those eargasm songs. Definitely in their top 5. I cannot describe it further, it simply makes me close my eyes and sway when I'm listening with the Pod.  Corona is a delightful little romp, one of those north mexican polkas. The only polka they've done, from what I've heard. And one is enough. This one polka, good. Any more, and we'll see.  Praskovia is, in a word, FUCKED UP. I LOVE IT.  It's this discombobulated accordion music laying down the beat of a waltz, while ... how would I describe this guitar... the notes get under your skin and just make you shiver. It's like some sort of maniacal circus music where they lock the doors on you and make you watch as elephants have knife fights and clowns mutilate small animals. Really goddam solid instrumentals, these people are my gods  I've added to this analogy of a deranged and homicidal circus: imagine, if you will, a highwire, where bizarre sexual acts between two contortionists are taking place. That guitar music? Being played by a hideous, potbellied ringleader with fingernails like claws. The bastard is practically TEARING the notes out of the guitar. That's how it sounds. Oh, and the accordions? Being played by zombified, brain-hungering koalas, echidnas, and giraffes, all of them riding a merry-go-round with decapitated horses.  Yeah, it's a great song. Get the album, just for this. It so needs a wild music video, directed by yours truly.  And finally, Sirena is another perfect, high-spirited Calexico song, with a cool mythical theme.  They're coming back into town in September, I believe. No, I take it back, they're coming to Austin, but who the hell cares? Close enough for me, I'll be making my journey to Mecca to listen to those gods of rock. If you want a taste, go to their  urlLink site  and take a look at the mp3s section.  I hate to take a moment and go off on a tangent about  myself , but here goes. I'm a bit miffed at how things are turning out, life-wise. I have too much to do, and not enough time to do it in. Getting driver's ed, school, studying, reading, I finally want to write really badly, and a dozen little knick-knacky things with games, which is ridiculous, but I still want to indulge myself.  That, along with all the responsibilities to home and such. Meeting someone lovely and nice to laugh and have a good time with seems like a pipedream at this point, but fingers crossed.
