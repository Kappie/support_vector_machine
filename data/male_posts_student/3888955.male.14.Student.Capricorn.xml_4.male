In spite of all the evidence that led him to be standing outside of an empty Charms classroom and watching two people passionately kissing one another. There simply had to be another reason: Polyjuice potion, mistaken identity, love potion or something, anything other than his Hermione kissing Draco Malfoy.    The smirk of Draco as he drew back for air and the small smile of Hermione that he had seen thousands of times, quickly extinguished his last remaining hopes and started a tidal wave of heartache and pain. Clearly, he could recognize evil and arrogant Head Boy Draco Malfoy, his arch-nemesis since the first day of attending Hogwarts, wrapping his arms around her and squeezing tightly for another embrace. What was not so clear to Ron was Head Girl; Hermione Granger, the secret love of his life, passionately returning the kiss. Why would Hermione, the brightest, bravest, and most beautiful witch in Hogwarts be kissing a boy who for the last six years has done everything in his power and family money to make life miserable for Hermione, Harry, and himself.  "Can't she see through the lies of this arrogant and evil ferret?" Ron thought to himself.    The giggling of Hermione as Draco reached into her robes immediately broke Ron's thoughts. Hermione quickly re-consummates the kiss with a sexual passion that Ron had never seen before. The realization of this moment had finally arrived. Hermione is in love with Draco. No longer was she the one that Ron had hoped to spend his life with. She chose another, in spite of his undying love, the life-saving trust between them, and the six and a half years of friendship. In the end, extreme confidence, power, money,  looks won.    Which Ron could never offer her, he nor Harry was chosen for Head Boy. A position, that offered its own private and shared common room with the Head Girl. Ron was merely a seventh year prefect delegated to do nightly patrols with Mr. Filch and Mrs. Norris, while Harry had the honor of being the Quidditch Captain, not that he minded.    As for money, his family barely made enough to keep him in school. Even his older brothers: Bill, Charlie, Fred  George had to contribute to the family so that Ginny and he could get much needed new school robes. Malfoy had more Galleons stacked at Gringotts vault than most wizards and witches in England combined.    As for looks, Malfoy manage to generate the biggest of smiles from the girls in Hogwarts. His straight blond hair, to his blue eyes, combined with his Quidditch physique made him a heartthrob among the girls. Ron's lanky body of 6 ft 2, thick messy red hair and second hand clothes had none of the girls turning their heads at him.    Lastly, extreme confidence or in Ron's view of Malfoy—arrogance is whole heartily in Malfoy's corner. Ron couldn't dare tell his feelings about Hermione to even his closest friend, Harry Potter. The fear of rejection and ultimately losing her friendship kept him silent for years. He had always known that Hermione could have any guy in Hogwarts or out, and it scared him more than anything that if he came out with his feelings, she would run to another.    Hermione was lifting Draco's robes off and sliding her hand into his shirt. This sight was the last thing that Ron could bear as he felt the need to find the Men's loo. He held his mouth shut as he dashed through a crowd of 3rd years, past Peeves throwing ink pellets at him and down the staircase to the 2nd floor Boy's bathroom, just in the nick of time. His stomach as if taking marching orders from his heart violently heaved his breakfast and lunch. After fifteen minutes of trying to recover himself; he realized that he was late for his NEWT Potions with Professor Snape and sprints to the dungeons.    Ron opened the Potions' classroom door quietly and seeing Professor Snape lecture while facing the chalkboard, he quickly made his way to Harry and Hermione's station that has an empty seat beside Hermione. Ron seated himself, while Professor Snape was still lecturing on the uses and benefits of Dragon's blood.  "Now that I've explain everything to you all, except for Mr. Wealsey who thinks he can sneak into my class whenever he likes," Snape snarled, turning around from the chalkboard and looking directly at Ron. Ron after being used to six years of taunts from Snape merely raise his head and looks at his scowling face.  "You shouldn't have been late," Hermione whispered to Ron.  "Well Mr. Weasley, are you going to offer a feeble excuse?" asked Snape, moving closer to Ron and looking at him directly in the eyes.  "I was feeling sick and had to throw up in the loo," answered Ron, almost willing Snape to use Legimency to see the disgusting image of him, throwing up in the bathroom.  Professor Snape broke the stare, looking disgusted at Ron's answer. "Yes be that as it may, 10 points from Gryffindor."  After returning to his desk, Snape tapped a sand time-turner with his wand, causing the sand to move up from the bottom against the gravity to collect upside down on the top.  "You have an hour to complete your Potions." he finished, folding his arms and starting his parade around the room.    Ron just wanted to complete the potion and get out of there. The mere presence of Hermione being so close to him made his heart and stomach ache even more. To make matters worse, Ron caught glances of Hermione smiling at Draco across the room. It was the same glances and smiles that he had been noticing Hermione giving in the Great Hall toward the Slytherin table, for the last few weeks. Moreover, He noticed the secret note that he saw her reading in NEWT Herbology, which made him follow her after class to the empty Charms classroom.    Draco lifted his head from over his boiling cauldron and returned another smile back to Hermione. Hermione responded by biting her lower lip before she looked down and across at Ron. Ron could really feel his heart and stomach rolling all over again.  "Ron, you haven't put anything in your Potion. Honestly, do I have to do everything for you?" said Hermione exasperatedly, while reaching her hand over to Ron's arm to get his attention.    Ron couldn't even hear what she was saying but could instantly feel the cold touch of her hand as she touched his arm. The image of her reaching under Draco's shirt with the same hand less than an hour ago came flooding back to him. He instinctively, jerked his arm away from her, but the damage had already been done, as he raced out of the Dungeon classroom for the Men's loo once again.    After spending some more time in the bathroom, he decided not to risk another encounter and skipped all the rest of the classes. He went to the sanctuary of his four post bed in the Gryffindor's seventh year boys' room.  "Ron – Ron, are you okay?" asked Harry, climbing the stairs with a worried look on his face.  "No Harry, I'm far from ok," Ron whined, looking up at the top of his four post bed, trying to make sense of it all.  "What's wrong with you," asked Harry, jumping into his own bed at the right of Ron's.  "I... I saw Hermione...," replied Ron, not able to put the scenes he witnessed into words.  "You see Hermione everyday...Hello!?" cracked Harry, lying on his side and looking strangely at Ron.  "No, not like that... with another guy," Ron finished, trying to hold his voice on an even tone.  "Are you sure?" asked Harry, with a 'not-too-surprised' look on his face.  "Yeah, Malfoy," replied Ron.  "Maybe you thought you saw something else...," remarked Harry, rolling over and away from Ron.  Ron twisted around his bed to a sitting position, to look at the back of Harry lying on his bed.  "I just said I saw Hermione with Malfoy, and all you can say is maybe I thought I saw something else?" said Ron, in total disbelief at Harry's reaction. "Malfoy, the Death Eater wanna-be, who has tried to make our lives miserable since we got here. That git-faced Malfoy, ring a bell?"  "I know who the ferret is, Ron. I'm just saying are you sure you really saw it?" replied Harry, still not looking up in Ron's direction.  "Yeah Harry, I saw Hermione and Draco in an empty Charms classroom going at it like it was their honeymoon!" snapped Ron, wanting Harry to believe him and trying to hold back the rumbling in his stomach.  An awkward silence settled in between them as Harry exhaled and rolled back over to look at Ron.  Ron immediately noticed the sympathy in Harry's eyes versus the anger he expected to see.  "Ron, she's old enough to make her own decisions."  "You knew – YOU KNEW!" Ron screamed at his best friend.  Harry groaned in pain and spun around on the bed to look directly at Ron, "she swore me to secrecy, when I found out."  "You're my best mate and you knew how I felt about her. How could YOU BLOODY NOT TELL!" Ron said lividly.  "Ron listen, I don't like it anymore than you do, but I've always stayed away from getting involved between you two." Harry pleaded compassionately, guilt written all over his face.  "Well, thank you Harry, and just how long have you been keeping this to yourself?" Ron asked angrily, looking straight at Harry to hear and see his answer.  "Er... about... about a month."  Ron couldn't reply as he had to race to the seventh year boy's bathroom to throw up again.  "Ron...I'm sorry," said Harry apologetically, after Ron finished heaving up everything in his stomach.  "You can keep your apology –Blaugh!- and you can take your knife out of my back. -Blaugh!- Mates don't do this to one another. -Blagh!-  So you can find a new one!" yelled Ron, with his head in the toilet.  "Ron you don't mean it. She said you wouldn't be emotionally mature enough to handle it," Harry explained logically, trying to calm Ron down from breaking their trusted friendship.  "Mature?!... Emotionally mature to handle my best mate lying to me and my love... Hermione... Her betrayal to me for Malfoy?!" Ron bellowed, while sticking his red and green face out of the toilet. "She's right again, because I can't handle it. Because, I don't want to handle it!"  Ron stood up and stuck his head under the shower to wash his face and hair.  "Ron, why don't you just tell her how you feel and I'm sure she will dump the ferret," Harry pleaded with Ron, along the running shower.  "Little late for that, wouldn't you say Harry? I mean I don't have the emotional maturity like Hermione and you have, but it seems to me that after witnessing them this afternoon, I'll say, SHE ALREADY LOVES THE FERRET!" Ron screamed, walking out of the shower, soaking wet in his school robes. In the same state he started climbing down the spiral staircase to the Common Room, with Harry following suit.  "You know you're right. This is my fault. I mean, I cared and loved her for over six years, when I really should have been calling her Mudblood and hoping that a Basilisk would kill her, or Sirius Black do her in or even try to hex her outside the Potions' classroom. Heck, I forgot about the time he tried to get her expelled when they raided the DA meeting and then last year when he told his old dad on us and watched as we almost got killed. Yeah, that's what I should've done instead. All that evil crap, so I could win her heart. I mean Hermione can't help it; chicks dig evil, twisted monsters." Ron said bitterly.  "Ron will you slow down," Harry yelled, reaching the bottom of the Boys' dormitory spiral staircase, as Ron briskly made for the Portrait hole.  "I should've been a Slytherin bad-boy and then I could have dated whoever I wanted." Ron cracked madly, while slamming the portrait on Harry's face.  Harry said nothing as he came to a complete stop and simply looked at the back of the Portrait entrance.  "What's wrong with him," asked Ginny, coming up behind Harry.  "He knows."  "Oh...I better go talk to him before he does something rash," said Ginny, brushing up against Harry to get out.  "No Ginny, He just needs some time on his own. He's in a lot of pain," said Harry, grabbing Ginny by the arm to stop her.
