"When you walk on the road, if you walk on the right, it's ok. If you walk on the left, it's ok. But if you walk in the center, squish - just like grape......"   I think what it basically means is that whatever you do, be decisive and stick to the decision.............being indecisive will only lead you nowhere.............  That aside, i have come up with a theme word for after the exams............it's "INDULGE".............and that's exactly what i'm doing now.................indulging in guilt free TV watching..............actually i have one more paper tomorrow................but what heck...............
