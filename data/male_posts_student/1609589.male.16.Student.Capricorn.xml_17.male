UNLESS YOU WERE A GIANT EYE!!! You're not a giant eye, are you?  I play tuba07: just checking something I play tuba07: sorry ShuChoMouf: so i was slapping this turtle the other day I play tuba07: and then? ShuChoMouf: it was like "oy! stop it!" ShuChoMouf: and i said "you can't talk!" then i kicked it into satan I play tuba07: and what did satan do? ShuChoMouf: and satan laughed so hard his horns turned into jello I play tuba07: *GASP* I play tuba: NOT JELLO ShuChoMouf: and then he cried because jello is an absolute good, therefore satan couldnt eat it I play tuba: u know, i can make pudding out of jello gelatin mix ShuChoMouf: i know, i know ShuChoMouf: i have some gelatin mix I play tuba: only on wednesdays, though ShuChoMouf: i thought it was thursdays!
