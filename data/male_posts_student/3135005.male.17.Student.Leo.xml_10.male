I call it 3rd omniscent because I'm seeing everyone's point of veiw and i know a few of you well enough for an opinion. Or as my teacher calls it, the "god" point of view, I hear what all yall had to say and what you are still saying, except rose of coarse. Yall aren't afraid to admit ur wrongs in this situation, which shows you guys are taking responsibility for you share of this shit. I dont know what little idea crawled into her head to drop all this confidential shit on people's heads but she needs to act her fucken age. When u trust someone like dragon trusted you, you dont just toss it away. Yah yall might be mad at each other and dont talk to each other but that doesnt mean u bring up what was said while u  were  friends. There is a reason its called confidential... or does the word not process for you? Gosip like that isn't even high school gossip, thats straight middle school, the whole he said his friend said bullshit. I remember that from middle school, never thought i would see it ever again in my life, except for, of coarse, from the withering old ladies. Usually thngs said in private are very personal, so it might even be the "worst" side of people, like talking about girls and looks. But Dragon isnt shallow and i know that. He may not consider me his friend but im still his student. And as one i can say that guys will be guys, just like girls will be girls. Can't tell me youve never said "that guys is so fine" or some shit like that. So would you now consider your self shallow? You should, don't try and go hypocritical now... But youve already dug ur self into a hole, but this is too deep for you to get out of, but im not sure if u could lift   ur   foot even six inches off the ground. You may not have this blog but if it was meant to get to you it will. Might just learn something new.Just accept the shit u signed for. You reep what you sow...
