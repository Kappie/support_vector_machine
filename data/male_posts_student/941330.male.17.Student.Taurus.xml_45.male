"grand theft auto 3!" "aww i want one" "do you have a ps2?" "no, i have a gamecast" "no, there's gamecube and dreamcast, there's no gamecast" "i said i have a gamecast!"  haha we were talkin about how some logan guy should pick up erik by the neck, and then erik would say "don't be hatin"  then we went to krispy kreme where erik ate 7 donuts in 2 minutes. then we went to ruddfuckers...uh...fuddruckers to eat burgers and stuff, even though apparently hecka ppl went to in n out but we had to be original. eugene didn't get his ostrich burger; he gave his name as fred...patrick lo's not a very good paper towel ripper, and he has abdullah's mom on speed dial...the waitress was named char from logan, she knew serena kwong...scary  then we walked to abdullah's house then a school to play bball...amanda kept on thinking she was going to die, but of course we were there to protect her from evil logan goons...we let erik go it alone tho :-D hahaha...we saw some white guys our age or a lil older across a street, eugene pointed at erik and yelled "he's from american!" ...those guys were staring at us for 10 minutes, amanda and eugene were so desperate they were hiding behind me of all people  we played some ball...i have no hops but it was still cool, i made a couple shots and tried some layups...we played some other guys, pat and eugene (crazy tomahawk) and abdullah (crazy one-hand tomahawk) and erik all made some craaazy dunks over the other guys' asses...pat was like lightning, stealing passes and finishing strong...erik packed hecka ppl, but this one white guy (in blue t-macs no less) packed him hard and sent him sprawling  what else...i watched crouching tiger with my uncle and aunt (wow...so lo is the tiger and jen is the dragon...i am actually learning something in mandarin class)  seven...haha...i dont mean to offend anybody, i will stop this fronting
