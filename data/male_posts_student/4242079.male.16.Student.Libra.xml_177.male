Listless, I lay here on the couch, with an internet connection that comes and goes, watching the circus that is the california recall election unfold on CNN. I will restore my computer again today, for the fourth time in as many days. This time, I will not put Kazaa back on it. If i need a song, I will use the computer upstairs and transfer it from there via CD, or in the near future, JumpDrive (I've been told by my boss that I absolutely must have one). I also need a PDA. But that is my own perogative. I am supposed to do something with Robyn tomorrow. I am quite looking forward to it, provided it actually happens. I requested two days off this week in lieu of the Monday night that never happened. It will remain to be seen if this is actually the case. I'm really sick of cancelling plans with the people most important to me because of work. I've missed birthday parties and movie nights and just simple times hanging out and chilling with my friends. It's inhuman of a job to ask that of you, no matter what position you hold. Dwayne, the manager of the other store, has gained a new respect from me. The other night, I heard him talking about work, and how on his day off, he would tell our Regional Manager that he's not coming into work because he's going to spend time with his son, and if he doesn't like it, then he can fire him. That is admirable to me.
