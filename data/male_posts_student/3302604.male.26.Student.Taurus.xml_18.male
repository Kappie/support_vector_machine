I almost thought that I had forgotten to get him anything what with him living about 500 miles away, this would be quite awkward. Never fear, though, I managed to get it to him when I saw him in April, its just that I've forgotten what it was that I actually got for him. I'm sure with a little gentle questions I'll find out sooner or later.  Yesterday was just gorgeous. Now that lectures are coming to a close, it gives me more opportunity to just sit around in the sunshine doing nothing and that's exactly what I spent yesterday luchtime doing. Out the back of university there's an artificial river bed in the middle of a field of poppies with some really big rocks scattered around. This is where I like to just sit and do nothing. The rock heats up like crazy in the sushine so it's like getting grilled and you can tan without even turning over. Nice. So now I've get red- brown arms which will have to keep me warm as all of a sudden its raining again. No surprises there then.  The  urlLink RSPB  has decided to find out why there are less birds around than there used to be, and to do this they have developed a very simple but completely bizarre experiment. What you do is this. You drive around the countryside for a bit and when you get home you just count the number of bugs splatted on your registration plate. Simple. Trouble is, if you're going around killing bugs by driving into them doesn;t this mean that there will be even less for the birds to eat?  One of the great mysteries of the modern world  Jack
