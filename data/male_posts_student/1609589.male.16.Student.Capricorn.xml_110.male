Now, the cheerleaders are having independent thoughts(you knew it would happen, bear with me), and now think that they are a sport of their own. No, you're not.     I was watching one of those UCA championships and i was sitting there, confused out of my mind, looking at the TV screen, trying to figure out what the cheerleaders were cheering for.     They would explain it as "it's difficult! you have to stand on eachother and move in formation! it's a sport in itself!" Fuck you, you're backup. That's it. I don't know who you think you are, but what you are doing isnt cheerleading, it's dancing with a bunch of obnoxious yelling.     I keep seeing ads for "CHEER!", this video that teaches you to cheer, and i had to turn away in disgust at the huge smiles these shallow soulless teenagers have painted on their overly round heads. Now I know why people say that white people have no soul.     While I'm here, I'd like to state that California has gone COMPLETELY FUCKING INSANE!!!  Arnold Schwartzenegger Gary Coleman Peter Gallagher The pervert that whacked off so much he lost his legs  Well, if the christian apocalypse is true, this is it.  I can't even make jokes about it, it's too wierd already.  I hope you're happy, fucking evangelists, screwed california over before the rest of us.
