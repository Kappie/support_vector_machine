Am I suddenly ready for this part of Your plan?  I want this so much. Relationships are what we were meant for, and I don't understand why I've been deprived of the second greatest kind that you created.  Please, give me understanding or let me forget this emptiness.  Your will is Your will.  But this is my desire!  To be able to completely connect with another human being, with no barriers, with complete comfort and safety.  To be able to completely know another, and for them to completely know me, the true me, and for us to be able to rejoice in that great gift that You gave us.  Why am I constantly and consistently denied this!?  I desire this connection.  It is not merely something I want, but it is something I NEED.  I want to buy a movie, I need food... and I need this.  I am not complete.  You in all Your wisdom, know this.  You did not create us to be alone.  Lord, as I am, I am only half a person.  If the other half of me is out there and ready for me, please make it happen, show them to me, reveal to me Your plan!  This is torture, Lord. I am not so nieve to think that all this doesn't have it's purpose, I just desire to know what it is.  I desire to know You and know Your purpose for me at this moment, at least. Anger: Why must people I care for suffer? Take the heart of my friend and that of her family, and wrap them up in a big warm blanket and give them the biggest hug you can.  Help them through their grieving, don't let them fight it.  You are God. The beginning and the end, and You love us... make that love shine more brilliant in their lives than ever before. Gratitude: Lord, You have given me many gifts, and blessed me many times.  I could have an incurable disease or come from a broken home... but You walked with me the whole time, sometimes I ignored You, but You were always there, picking me up if I fell, and I fell often.  You are the great and awesome Creator of Everything.  The warm sunny day with a wisp of cloud is Your work of art.  Thank You for Your greatness, for all Your gifts to us.  Thank You for the gifts I've received, especially for my friendships... or friendship.  But I think You and I are both realizing that I was making some bad choices with the people I let in.  You've shown me a place that I can be safe. Thanks, God.  A lot of those songs and psalms really know what they're talking about.
