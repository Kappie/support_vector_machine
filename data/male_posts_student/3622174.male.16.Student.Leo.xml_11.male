In Family Feud, you hop into this giant pool of players and compete against them for the most points.  The game gives you a question, and you have to answer it with as many different possibilities as you can think of.  Each question was a survey, and if your answers compare to the answers of others, then you'll earn points.  If you get all three or four of the answer choices, you'll get the most points, and soar up on the leaderboard.  Then, after three rounds or regular play, you'll go into fast money mode, where there are 5 questions, and you have to guess the answer to each one, and get the same answer as the majority of people who did the survey, in order to score big points.  This game has been around for a while, now.  I've played it since I was a freshman 3 years ago, and it's just as addicting as ever.  I have no idea when they add new questions, but, every time I play the game, it seems incredibly fresh.  I think there was only once when I played the game and had the same questions.  This game is fun to play in school, with your friends around to help you guess the best answers.  Fast money, especially, is fun to play with friends because you have a time limit of like 30 seconds, and you have to guess each one correctly in order to get the most amount of points possible.   urlLink    Family Feud is an awesome multiplayer game, and gives you and your friends something to do when you're bored in class. urlLink     Family Feud is one of the most addicting games on Uproar, maybe the whole web.  It's better than Text Twist, but not as good as Zuma.  I give Family Feud, on Uproar, a stunning  4.5 out of 5.
