I'll start with the new.  There's only 2 more performances of The Imaginary Invalid left, 2:00 and 7:30 tommorow. A lot of hard work went into this production by the tech crew, cast, band, and directors, so I better see  everyone  there...  I'll still be busy, even after school's out, but whats new. Marching band, MITY, MusicTech camp, jazz stuff, and friends of course.  I best be outta here, Bren
