Apparently I’m not good enough for Wal-Mart, you’d think that I would be offended.  But you see they expect that a full time student would be at the store working when he normally gets out of class. I don’t know about all you guys but I see some slight schedule conflicts here. And there’s no way that I’m skipping class everyday just so I can work at Wal-Mart.  And I find it a little suspicious how many questions they ask about pot and other drugs.  Like if they saw a superior using an illegal drug what would you do? I think that Wal-Mart is full of druggies, it makes a lot of sense doesn’t it?  They always smile, they never pay attention, and they smell funny. It all adds points to one thing…Wal-Mart is full of stoners. And now that I think about it I wouldn’t want to work there very much anyway.  I don’t want to wear the bib…I mean…the smock, I’d better say that so I don’t offend the employees. But what am I complaining about?  There are tons of desperate companies out there plenty willing to hire me. So I’m going to apply and hope for the best. HOOHAH!  -Matt
