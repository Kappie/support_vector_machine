I try to defragment my computer every couple weeks or so to keep it as neat and organized as possible. For as long as I can remember whenever I want to defrag my computer, I've always used the defragment tool built into Windows XP, but recently I heard about Disk Keeper on  The Screen Savers  and decided to check it out.  You can either download a trial to see if you like it like I have done (just Google it and you'll find a place to d/l it I'm sure), or of course, get it from Kazaa so you don't have to pay for the full version - however, that is not recommended! ;) I like it, and find it works alot better than the sub-par defrag tool Windows has, go check it out.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
