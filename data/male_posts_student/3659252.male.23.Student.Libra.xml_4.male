I think we should call ahead and reserve tickets so we don't have to wait in that massive line of punks. Here are the movies and showtimes of movies that I want or am willing to see:   AMC Westgate Mall Cinema    Around the World in 80 Days -  (1:30 PM), (4:20), 7:10, 9:50    Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban -  (2:00), (4:00), (5:10), 7:10, 9:15      AMC Westwood Town Center Cinema    Day After Tomorrow, The -  (1:10 PM), (4:10), 7:00, 9:40    Spider-Man 2 -  12:01 AM    Stepford Wives, The -  (2:55), (5:10), 7:30, 9:50    Terminal, The - ( 4:00), 7:00, 9:50    Oh yeah...so "Spiderman 2" comes out on Wednesday and I reeeeeeeeeeally want to see it. I own the first one and was going to watch it this week so I can refresh my memory with every nerdy detail. Either of these activities sound appealing to you guys? I don't HAVE to see it on opening day, but if I wait too long to see it, I may develop a bladder infection. If none of you want to see it, I'll be forced to take my mom. I'll be dressed as Spiderman and she will be dressed as Doctor Octopus...
