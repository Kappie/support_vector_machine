Badminton...or track...or tennis...or neither? I'm so indecisive with these things. I know   I should've played something last year  ...I haven't even really met up with any coaches yet...oh well, I'll just see what happens. Other than that,   no worries  ...except, stupid chem test...and I still want a new wallet. Why? Beats me...
