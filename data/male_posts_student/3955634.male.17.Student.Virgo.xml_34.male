Perhaps it doesn't play out in the traditional media, but liberals can be pretty damn caustic (proof  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here , and urlLink  here ).  Humor strikes me as more useful in solidifying a candidate's base--Bush's fans "get it" when the flash-animated Bush (of  urlLink jibjab  fame) accuses Kerry of having "more waffles than a house of pancakes"; liberals just get upset. Likewise, endlessly mocking Bush's misuse of the English Language produces the opposite effect. Humor may lighten the mood of the election a bit, but it's not going to introduce any newcomers to the political process. Mocking Kerry as undistinguished simply isn't going to make sense to those who don't follow politics, and may actually turn them off--having to explain an inside joke kind of kills the funny.  For now I'm saying this is a misstep. Rove may be trying to do damage control to save some of Bush's home votes, but I don't think he's even considering picking up votes...there's not too many undecideds out there waiting for images of Kerry in a  urlLink blue bunny suit , or for someone on a TV ad to accuse him of being a UN pussy. I think the general populace deserves a wee bit (and I do mean very wee indeed) more credit.
