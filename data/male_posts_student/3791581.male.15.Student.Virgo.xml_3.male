For those of you who aren't aware, Jay's contract at his last consulting gig in New Jersey was not renewed this time around. He found out the same week we got back after Lolo's funeral.    Long story short, he accepted a permanent position with an Atlanta based company that is looking to expand into Canadian markets. He will be part of the team in charge of that and the company has given him the opportunity to telecommute from Toronto after his training is over. This is his dream - working from a home office in pj's in Toronto and still having the advantage of making US dollars.  That was just too sweet of a deal to pass up. So we're giving up the consultant's nomad lifestyle...at least for now.    That being said we'll be back in Toronto on a more permanent basis soon.  But I still haven't given up my dream to live in California again one day. I see Cin frowning over there because she's been on a mission to get us back there ever since we left.    And so now if you're confused as all heck, you are not alone!  I'm still trying to wrap my brain around the logistics of this move too.  Hee!  Oh and welcome to the blog finally Lovielyn!  Glad to see you here.
