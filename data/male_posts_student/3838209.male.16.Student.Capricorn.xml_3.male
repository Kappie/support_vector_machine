I had been so certain that i was going to fail. I barely knew what i was writing on that day, and i hadn't even planned my essay!!! In fact, if u ask me, i would say all i wrote was nonesense!!!  But to my surprise, i scored an A2!!!!! I couldn't believe it!!! In fact, i even told Mr Sakar that i didn't deserve the grade! I certainly must say, God has answered my prayer that day. I still remember vaugely how i prayed: " Lord, if it is your will that i fail my GP exam, give me the strength to accept it Lord. I do not blame you Lord, but i ask that You help me to continue placing my trust in you, and to continually thank You for everything You have given me!"  In a way, God has taught me so many lessons through this. Also, i learnt that God is always there, no matter what, i just never noticed....
