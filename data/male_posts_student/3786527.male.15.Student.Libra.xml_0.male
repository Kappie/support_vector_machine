Then  i got on the computer and checked my email and a couple sites that i frequent then i played a game...got off and watched TV the rest of the day. I also saw the last episode of The Real World, kind of sad that they all left...too bad those girls were hot! ah well. Well tomorrow a few guests that are visiting my sister from Denver(my hometown) are coming over for dinner, they're pretty nice people ive met them before.  well thats all folks, cya!
