Maybe he should campaign as the "ignorance is bliss" candidate, because that certainly seems to be his policy.  Let me give you some things he said about the senate:  "...in this Senate... it's my way or the highway, shut the door, lock the people out, don't let them take part in the democracy, don't respect the institution. Don't show the common courtesies that actually bring people together to find the common ground."  Hey, it sounds like he's talking about the constitutionally abusive filibusters!  Maybe he's actually in touch with the real world for once! Oh wait, he continued by saying this:  "So they found a way all day to twiddle their thumbs, do very little, attend a reception at the White House, but not let John Kerry vote."  (Sigh) Well, I'd say he's completely right; the senate does have a problem with locking people out and not letting them take part in democracy.  One of those people is Miguel Estrada.    "(The Republicans) Don't show the common courtesies that actually bring people together to find common ground."  Hey, at least the Repubs let the Democrats talk.  One can't even find that much courtesy in the Democrats' record.    In Kerry's world, the earth is still flat, the sun revolves around the earth, and everything revolves around Kerry.  In Kerry's world, we are in a worse situation economically than theSoviet Union, but instead of having a great humanitarian like Stalin as leader, we get stuck with a warmongering cowboy who is a complete wimp.  Again, that's in Kerry's world.    In the real world things are different.  If anyone wants to know what things are like in the real world, he must simply listen to what Kerry says... and then not believe a word of it.    The new JFK's view of the world is a paradox, an obvious contradiction to reality.  Therefore, when referring to something paradoxical or outright stupid that John Kerry says, it shall be called a Kerrydox.  It could also be called a Kerrymoron, but we will reserve that for references to Kerry himself.  Maybe if we all vote for Kerry, he can take us all to his alternate reality, where everything is wrong and he can fix it all.  That way, he would be a hero, at least in his own little world.  UPDATE:  I (yet again) posted the wrong link.  Now you should be able to visit the site that has the story I mentioned.
