In math he got on the subject of world records with Commander Cool.  They talked about his bowling experience that he and Kinker "plan on doing."  Fat chance of that.  But in this day and age you can never know.  Who knows...maybe a bowling alley will sponsor their 3-day bowl-a-thon.  2nd period was pretty bland.  Haha, get it?  It was a pun.  Tyke likes being all tough and stuff in Weight Training.  There are so many underclassmen that he looks old and strong.  Even though he really isn't.  At least upper body.  Lower body he can hold his own but not upper body.  But since he knows all of the lifts and such he can teach everyone in the class and since NOBODY seems to know how to do dots or power cleans he looks like a total stud being good at those.  Even though he really isn't good at power cleans.  3rd period would have been hella boring if Tyke and Purdy didn't write to each other would you rathers and such.  Tyke asked a Would You Rather about who would you rather make out with: Jessica Simpson or Britney Spears.  And so far 100% of the answers have been Britney Spears.  One of the answers was foolish: "I can't make out with someone who is stupid."  Come on!  Sure ya can!!!  And who says Britney isn't stupid???  Anyway, this is boring to write for Tyke.  So it must have been a boring day.  4th period was alright.  Tyke said some stuff that was funny.  No biggies though.  Just the use.  After 4th period Tyke went out to lunch with Purdy and Kinker to Front Street.  Macaroon was unexpectedly left out in the cold however.  Tyke will take the hit on that one but it wasn't totally his fault.  It's all good in the end.  5th period was long and boring.  6th period was ok.  After school was boring cuz he went home and did nothing.  Watched some Full House of course but that was pretty much it.  Played some bball downstairs but really that was all.  Then he...nope, that actually was it.  Oooo, Amazed just started playing.  Now there is a great song.  It was in the True Life episode that Tyke saw a brief glimpse of while channel surfing tonight.  It was about 4 youths in wheelchairs and their daily life.  The song was played at this handicapped guy's prom.  And he was singing along.  Yeah, well Tyke right now has something he really wants to talk about but won't.  He wants to talk about it so bad that he is writing this.  It is weird.  Tyke is such a personable person that he always is wanting to talk about his feelings and such but just he doesn't feel like he should tell anyone about this.  It is really odd.  This is just something that he...grrrrrr.  Enough.  Stop.  This blog is going nowhere.  Tyke has had a boring night.  He has loved having no homework but he lied when he said it was relaxing.  It was just boring.  He wanted to do stuff.  Tyke really hates being couped up in the house.  He needs to go out or have people come over.  Double grrr...anyway, this blog has hardly been worthy of a post so let's just let Tyke cut his losses and be done with it.  Goodbye.  Ya know what sucks though...Dotti wasn't in class :(  That is saddening.  Oh yeah, and maybe Tyke feels kinda *bleh* cuz he is really sleepy.  He did fall asleep while watching TV tonight so that could be.  Hopefully...
