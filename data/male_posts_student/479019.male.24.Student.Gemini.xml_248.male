We haven't really chatted much in the past few months, with us being being busy and out and about during the summer.  Well today is the first day of class. I have a Comparative State Formations class at 7... so I have a lot of time to kill. I'll be going to the market again today. I need more juice and other beverages. I think I could also use some mouthwash, and paper towels too. After that, I'll probably come home, eat, and then go back to campus.  ***
