Nothing new, really, but the timing is pretty peculiar, as the Democratic Convention in Boston is just about to begin. DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe (gotta love him) had this to say:   "The supposed discovery of these records on Friday afternoon, as reporters converge on Boston to cover the Democratic National Convention, is highly questionable. If the Bush Administration continues to search, maybe they'll find answers to the long list of unanswered questions that remain about George W. Bush's time in the Air National Guard. Bush's military records seem to show up as randomly as he did for duty." You tell 'em, Terry. That last zinger especially made my day.
