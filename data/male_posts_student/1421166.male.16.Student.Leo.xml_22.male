But either way, i thought it would be a good way of reflecting for me. For now, I just feel like sitting on the couch doing nothing. It's like life's boring. I think that's the reason. Recently, I'm beginning to get into my own dream world once again. In this world, anything is possible, as long as you believe. Sounds like Matrix huh??? Well, it's just fantasy. Well, don't get me wrong, it's not infatuation. It's just that, for example, I can imagine being an X-men. Cool huh...imagine you could fly...whoa...yeah...it's just in the mind. But as long as it works in driving away boredom. So what's the problem with me??? What do I want? Maybe I just miss people. Maybe I just want to get into some exciting event to serve God.( I certainly hope I'm not serving myself that way.) But now, I seem all trapped and tied down by my books. Homework's piling up. But that doesn't bother me. (hehe...I'm gifted...in last minute work.) I think what I need now is sometime with God to reflect. A wondeful scenario is seeing myself in an air-conditioned room, with the sun's rays shining into the room. Giving warmth..feels like God's radiance. Just cosy. Then, with my journal in front of me, along with God's work, and preferably a book(Christian Literature). That'll be great. Some cake...Apple Strudel??? With Ice Lemon Tea would be so wonderful. And the whole place added with a touch of worship tunes. Wow!!! That would be awesome!!! But the only time I could do that is during the holidays. And without my parents home.(they'll probably scold me for switching on the air-conditioner. But something like that later would be satisfying enough, anyway, what could be compared to the very presence of our Father in heaven. =) I got my chance of gazing out of the window, and have the wind hitting onto my face. It's always so refreshing, and perfect for some reflection. But today, I longed for something. I'm not sure what...but I must remember that God is still my greatest desire. Well, today I had a great deal of time to do "nothing" since the teacher wasn't here, giving the class 4 free periods. But thank God, I needed that to finish my homework. Gave Darrel my blog address. So greetings to you!!! If he ever decides to drop by. Ok...time to go off to finish my work..so I can look forward to a great night tonight. No apple strudel though...hehe...
