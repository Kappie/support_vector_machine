The fire appeared to start in the attic, destroying the second floor, and the foyer area on the first floor. The house appeared completely ruined from the outside, little of it was untouched by fire, smoke, or water damage.        At the time these pictures were taken, access to the street was limited, and I couldn't get the best shot. Expect more pictures later.
