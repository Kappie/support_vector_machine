This evening's entertainment agenda featured Kodan Armada, French Toast, Black Eyes, and Q And Not U at the Keswick Democratic Club of Louisville, Kentucky.  It was a good time.  The last two bands managed to elevate the average enjoyment level of the evening to "fucking kick ass".  Kodan Armada are a local act, nothing too special.  They play Orchid-style hardcore and they play it well.  No complaints, catch them if you're not too busy.  French Toast are okay too.  One of them (the bald one) is Fugazi's "fifth member", or so I gather.  His songs aren't that good.  If they played more of the guy with hair's songs they'd be great.  The bald guy's songs are all pretty bassy and shouty, which isn't bad in itself, but they weren't too original.  Also there's only two of them, so while bald guy is singing hair guy is playing drums, and hair guy can't play drums too well.  Bald guy on the other hand is a really good drummer, and hair guy's songs (he plays guitar) are sparkly, streamlined throwbacks to the week in 1998 when it wasn't embarrassing to be called emo.  Now we get to the "fucking rule" portion of the evening.  I don't even think I can explain how much Black Eyes and Q and not U rule.  Both bands had the Louisville kids in an uproar of ass-shaking, and I confess that even I was moved to partake.  At one point the end of a Black Eyes song was met with a disappointed moan from all the rockin' groove junkies.  This is all the more surprising when you consider that the core of the Black Eyes sound is heavy dub atmospherics pierced with a saxophone that vacillates between free skronking and Middle Eastern whinging.  Q and not U are at root a far poppier proposition to begin with, but even their apparently wilful attempts to squander their dance-party goodwill with melodica solos in free rhythm were met with butt twitching and handclaps.  Ah yes the handclaps.  The youth of Kentucky, it turns out, are secretly a horde of trained seals.  They will use any, and I do mean any, excuse to start a handclap section during a song.  All four bands this evening were the beneficiaries of a truly sophisticated handclapping collective - those kids are fast, disciplined, and inventive on the old five and fives.  This is not to disparage the youth of Kentucky.  They are some genuinely nice and outgoing people.  Between songs and sets, I found myself engaged in conversation with the locals almost constantly.  Let's make a little comparison, shall we?   Bloomington, IN:    time spent in locale: One year, two months, four days.   number of people who talk to me at a show: Zero.     Louisville,KY:    time spent in locale: Less than eight hours. (lifetime total)    number of people who talk to me at a show: Around twelve.    Those Louisville kids, though.  They were actually all having fun.  At a show.  It's like nothing I've ever seen.  I realize that I may be making a mistake by seeming to conflate the quality of the show with the niceness of the scene kids, but it's my belief that while the two factors might have fed on each other in a synergistically buzzwordy fashion, they were each in themselves both pretty good.
