After a long long long 2 hours full of songs and nonsensical fillers, the winner was announced!! YAY!!! Fantasia!! Fantasia!! Fantasia!!   I was feeling very estatic, of course, but it hardly came as a surprise. Of course Fantasia will win. She should. HaHa! YaY! Lets hope Fantasta career would be fantastic one! :D   TODAY   Today is the last day of the term, and our GP exam. Well, it is a mixed paper of sorts. Why do I say so?  Paper 1, the essay component. I can say I find it quite easy. When I saw the questions, I was like "oh my lord...all I don't know". Then I spotted the last question, which is "'It's still a man's world' Do you agree?" YaY! I know how to do that one! I've done it for essay before (well, the female version..but the points are still the same). :D So happy. Of course. You cats should know what is my response. Disagree, strongly to boot, of course!   Paper 2, the comprehension component. The letdown! Oh my lord! The passages were all Greek to me! The questions are so crappy! Oh my my my my! Doomed le la!   Sigh! After that, we went out to eat lor. What did we eat? Long John Silver. Yeah. After that, we went to the library to study Maths.  Heh. I didn't really do any studying. I completed the TYS section for Log and Exponential Functions. Well, there were only 14 questions. After that, I was utterly bored. I was in no mood to do any maths. So I fell asleep. HaHa! Lazy moi! After waking up at 4+, I went down to borrow a book. Jackie by Josie. Such an intriguing book. CQ left first, then we left at 5+.  Hmm. Yeah. The usual lor. Now I am feeling sleepy, and I gotta wake up at 5.15 tomorrow. Remember tomorrow is the 29th? RS Award Ceremony!! YAY! Yeah. I have to leave the computer on for a couple of hours while I download the Friends episode from Amanda. The One About Phoebe's Rats. I think I go sleep, then let the alarm wake me up.   HaHa! Yeah. See ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!
