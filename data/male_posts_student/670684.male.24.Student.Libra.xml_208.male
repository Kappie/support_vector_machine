On this blog I mentioned the need for a summer on the coast in California, writing and relaxing and waking up late and working at a restaurant and finding myself.  But as I copied affidavits for a mock trial of George W. Bush for war crimes, I knew that I was where I wanted to be.  No doubt.  I will get paid $1600 for the six weeks I spend working at these camps...that is my bills and an extra $800.  That's $800 more than I need for this.    And I don't even have to be ambiguity.  or ambiguitous.    The kids love  urlLink HomeStar Runner , though the girls don't really understand why Teen Girl Squad is so funny.  Or Trogdor.  TROGDOR!  and the THATCHED ROOF COTTAGES!    No dreams...where have the exes and other sundries gone?    Strom Thurmond died?!  Really?  I know I wasn't funny before, but he was the part of my act that was funny.  People just don't laugh at the Paula Poundstone jokes like they did with his.  Or Phyllis Diller.  Thank God she's still here.
