So that's My dad, me, Kevvie, and.... Tom. :(. hopefully he will be rebellious and not be able to go, so I can take Devon instead. I am thinking of producing a witty banner, or possibly throwing my b0x0rs onto the stage. It will be great. October 23rd, portsmouth Guidhall. Hurrah Hooray Bugrit Millenium hand and shrimp.  A very happy Jams (OMGF!1! Jams!? Happy?!?)
