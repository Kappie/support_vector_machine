When I left for the airport on friday I had to go to the new airport, which I didn't even know existed, and I guess I almost missed the flight because there was a huge line up. I slept the whole time on the plane, like I usually do, and when I got to Calgary I had to wait like twenty minutes for my luggage to arrive. Me and my dad went to eat some A&W, and we eventually ended up at the new house. The house is really close to the city, so it's great :D. My brother and his friends were here for the weekend too, which was kinda good and kinda bad. They have many DVDs to watch which is great, we watched like two movies a day lol. On saturday me and my Dad went to the IMax and watched Spider-Man 2, and that was lots of fun because I've never been to an IMax before.  On monday we all had to drive down to Saskatchewan, which was really really really not fun. It was a seven hour drive to get there. I was incredibly bored for the last couple days... my Dad made me come with him while he worked, he had to check out a bunch of the oil wells... or something... I'm not really sure, all I know is that it's almost an hour drive between each well. My brother and his friend are currently still in Saskatchewan and are going to work there till the 14th which means I get the basement all to myself till saturday. I really didn't have much to do while I was in the truck for most of the day, I had my Dad's laptop, but the battery only lasts for a little while.  Umm... and today we drove back to Calgary, and this time the drive was slightly shortened... but I think that's because my Dad was driving forty kilometers over the limit :s... which means it only took five hours instead of seven lol. and ummm... not really much else to say I guess... other then I WAS REALLY BORED!  Me and my Dad are going to the Calgary Science Centre tomorrow, I'm hoping that will be fun. I'm thinking of stopping off at Electronic Boutique tomorrow too, maybe I'll get Doom 3 or something lol. Yeah... umm... so I guess I'll go eat me lasagna and cupcake lol :p..... byez!
