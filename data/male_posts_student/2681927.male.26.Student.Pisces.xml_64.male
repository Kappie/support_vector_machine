They lacked the straight forwardness a team must have to win nowadays. The Greeks played accordingly to their ability and took advantage of the mistakes Portugal made. Even though Portugal had the ball more and created more chances than the Greeks, I consider the result fair.   urlLink Greece spoil hosts' party ? Well yes, but with a great deal of help from Portugal.  My Man of the Match: Greek defender Traianos Dellas.
