Now, for $9.99, I felt it was a good deal, considering the cost to rent two movies from Blockbuster is almost that much anyways. Besides, the movie is just plain badass. If you've never seen it, the movie follows two Irish brothers (Connor and Murphy), strung together by religion and brotherhood, as they do what they believe is God's will by killing off criminals and mobsters.    Connor MacManus: These decent men with loving families, they go home every day after work, and turn on the news and you know what they see? They see rapists and murderers and child molestors and they're all getting' out of jail.  Murphy MacManus: "Mafiosos," getting' caught with 20 kilos, getting' out on bail. Same fucking day.  Connor MacManus: And everyone, everywhere thinks the same thing: that someone should just go kill those mother fuckers.  Murphy MacManus: Kill 'em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.   They're Irish... what more could you want? If you've never seen it, definitely check it out. Also, I recently got a Ben Kweller and The Blood Brothers CD. Pretty awesome, check 'em out if you're into that sort of thing.
