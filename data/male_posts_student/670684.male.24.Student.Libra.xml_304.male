The question is, which one can beat Bush?  Most likely it will be Lieberman, Kerry, Gephardt, or Dean...I like Dean the most, but he'll get the worst conservative backlash.  I've always thought Gephardt to be a pussy, and Kerry less than your usual Yes man.  But times change.  Not only would I take anything over George Bush at the moment, but I will adamently support the Democratic candidate (sans Lieberman), casting my volunteer abilities to the Democratic cause.  No, I cannot vote Green next year.  We've got to win.  The changes won't be swift, nor as large as I would hope.  But for the sake of domestic and foreign policy, and all things humanistic, we need George Bush to be a flash in the pan, and his cabinet of puppet masters put in media purgatory.    I can't bring myself to read Bill O'Reilley or Ann Coulter, but maybe I should.  Their bellicose stupidity makes me want to kick myself in the face until I pass out, but maybe reading it will help me when I talk to fly-by-night conservatives who can quote their ringleaders without understanding their words.    Beach this afternoon.  Red tide caused hundreds of dead fish to wash up on the shore, keeping me and most others out of the water.  Beatuiful sands though, calm waves, and a warm sun.  Two guys walked by, toned and tanned, just living the bum life.  It was my dream at the start of this year to be what they were this summer.  Sitting in my chair, with Dow Mossman's STONES OF SUMMER in hand, untanned, trimmer but not at all toned, less than tan, I questioned my choice for the summer.  Doubt lingered for several moments, then left quietly.  I would like to spend two days in Corpus before school starts, camping or living in a cheap motel, playing in the waves, drinking beers, and maybe meeting up with a twentysomething girl who likes beer, loves fun, and doesn't agree with most people about most things.  Interested?  I'll take headshots.    My sister was just on local Florida television, sweeping mosquitos into a dish as a reporter droned on about West Nile.  I missed most of the talk, but I'd assume it silly, editing my sister's interview heavily to show that there is not much of a threat of West Nile, but still a threat exists.  Fun times with news media.  Of course, I made half a dozen interviews on Shreveport television in my day, talking about lots of things but always supporting Centenary College.
