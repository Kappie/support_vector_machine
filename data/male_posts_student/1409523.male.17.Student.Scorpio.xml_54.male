MRS FOULKES SCHEDULES A REHEARSAL AT FIVE O CLOCK ... thats not even enough time for me to sit on my ass... and that takes no time at all..... damn... doesn't the woman know how busy tonight is... im going to kill myself.... i mean i like her... but what is it with the inconvenient scheduling .. i always get screwed over and then my teachers are like why are you so sick nate and i mumble but really its because i do too much and then they pull shitty practices and then i am up late doing my other damn teachers homework.... yeah so its no wonder i get rundown all the time.. .its amazing i survive this year after year.... AHHHHHHHHHH IM GOING TO LEAVE NOW!!!! goodby
