Although I am going to miss all of my other friends (Mariam, Jon, Jesse, Lauren, Gregg, etc.) Aaron will be with me so it will all be good.Its a good 12 hour drive to Myrtle Beach so it will be slightly boring. So we hooked up the N64 in the van and there is tv and happiness for all. Lovely aint it? Yeah it is. Goin to the House of Blues! That will be sooo much fun! YAY! Im gonna miss you people though! :( But hey itll be alright...right? It better be..Ok...bored. Im gonna go now. Bye!!!
