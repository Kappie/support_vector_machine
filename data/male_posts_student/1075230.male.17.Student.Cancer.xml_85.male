I know it's not much, but still!! (I'll explain some of them in depth later if I feel like it afterwards, MUHAHAHA!!! COMPLETE PAWA!!!)   Now the fire, some idiot tried to set my sister's building on fire... *mutters* these 3vil p3opl3...and unfortunately, there had been so many bluffs with the fire alarm, most people living in that residence thought it was another one. Luckily, my sister and some other girl found out there was a real fire, and warned everyone in time. *sigh* some people have too much time on their hands, either that... or..or... something...   ONLY 91%??!! Are you mocking me? That's what I got!! But then again, I was like "only 91%" too... ^^;; ... Ah yes, the space shuttle incident...I first heard of it - not on the news - but on  urlLink Megatokyo    Oh, and hope you and hoshi had fun today ^-~   Ok, I don't really feel like explaining those things in the first paragraph, ask me if you're interested... back to work I go...   ~Chronos
