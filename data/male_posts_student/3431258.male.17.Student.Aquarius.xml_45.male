A 19 pages assignment. I was writing while people watched the film in english class. It was a movie named  Hedwig , about a travesty who fled berlin to usa and formed a band, and got his/her songs ripped. The songs were indeed pretty nice(I'm no fan of Rock And Roll so it's a compliment). Did'nt really like the movie, anyway i had that report to write so...   Downloaded a bit of stuff and found  Microsoft Pinball Arcade . As you can see on the picture, it's well rendered and the physics make it play like real tables. What i love about  that game is that it retraces history of pinball. Each table is a testament to an era of tilt tables. My favourite table is Knockout, but Spirit of 1976 is pretty good as well.   Went to restaurant with my parents today. Don't remember the name of the place. It was a French food restaurant. I had a "Soupe a l'ognion". a "Steak au poivre" and some french fries. everything was great, especially that girl on the other table looking at me...   Gotta go to sleep,  Wanderley  will call me early tommorow. Time is not fast enough, can't wait tosee my friends in Canada!  Regards,  Zephyr
