I was unable to cheer her up though, no matter what i said. But she came around a bit over time. One great part of today however was i got to see sarah again ^_^. Thats my whole reason i went, cause ide see her. So I had a [retty good time... until i got home, and talked to Cassie's boyfriend (cassie is my best friend i mentioned). Her boyfriend, Steve (my best friend), was down too and he dragged me down and i dont know what ot do, so i say they should just break up and go their seperate ways because niether of them can be happy really, but thats just my opinion. Well im off to bed then, so ill post again later, hopefully with happy news
