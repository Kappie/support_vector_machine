Anyways, I was thinking about leadership positions because I'm still kinda bent out of shape by not getting a position, not even the lowest for which I applied (>_ that ." I've been so focused on taking everything one step at a time that I forget to look ahead. Some people would say that I don't really need it, that I would get accepted based on my current résumé alone. Maybe it's true, but I believe I am one of those caught in that crowd. There are of course the valedictorians, the athletes, some combination of the two, lower-rung students, and then my group. My group is comprised of a wide range of people with varying checks and balances that make them all look like a swarm of bees. All the same. So, then, it becomes a rat race for whomever looks sexiest to the colleges based on other contributing factors. SAT scores, extracurriculur activities, community service, and leadership.  _1) SAT scores: Okay, this is pretty much hit and miss. There are no two ways about it. Colleges accept standardized tests because they feel that it is a "good measure of how a student MIGHT [not 'will,'  might ] perform in college," based on mathematical, language, and not to mention, standardized test-taking skills *gasp*! even if you want to be a Bio major?! YES! _2) Extracurriculur activities: Everybody does  something  afterschool or outside of it. Just lather, rinse, repeat, and you've got a certified extracurriculur activity. _3) Community Service: this is a big one too. (Doesn't it seem like we're trying out for a beauty pageant? yeah, well, at least in this edition, they don't rate you on looks >_ could , I suppose, work somewhere more consistently, like say, the senior center, or the hospital, but I enjoy the flexibility of the community service provider for teens here "Education Compact." _3.5) Did I forget to mention? They take into account any overcoming of adversities in life too. Adversity? that's kind of happenstance, don't you think? not everyone is blessed/cursed with natural obstacles, at least, not the ones that people care to read about. _4) Here's the end all: Leadership. What it says to a college: I've got big cajones and will make you proud, because when I grow up and am all successful 'n' $#!%, you can say, "Hey, that guy went to our school!" Captains of teams, club officers, community leaders, speech contest winners, and all that goodness. That is where the action is at. Of course, you do have to have decent grades. I mean, you can't expect to get in on leadership alone, unless you're one of those people who can get in with teh sehksi monies or ur dean's the uncle. The great thing about leadership? NOT EVERYONE CAN BE A LEADER! there have to be followers for there to be leaders, right? and the leaders cannot outnumber the followers. Now here's the dilemma: who the hell chooses the leaders? I guess you could make your own leadership position and just say you're the leader of shitland. (notice I've stopped censoring myself, as I am now getting more intense and involved). But just what does it take to be a leader of anything? A lot of people can handle stress. I guess I wouldn't know because I've never held one before. Usually, I've lost the ones where the public votes (not exactly Mr. Popular of the year, if you know what I mean), but I tried nonetheless. I wonder if that would work on a college application, leadership? "Well.... I ran for yadda-yadda, blah blah, etc., etc., didn't win any of 'em." I also wonder, can you stage a coup de tat if you don't like the people who get elected? What would happen to the organization then? Would the burgeoisie rise up against the upper middle class partisans and start guillotining royalty? Could there be a club civil war? Could another club steal the business from another club and start a takeover, breaching into other chapters? I imagine my ideal club would be autonomous and definitely liberal. "Community Honorable-mention Organization"? I'd find it hilarious if CSF suddenly pulled a blitzkrieg on NHS and later got into a nuclear-cookie arms race against MeCHA. heh heh, Mecha.... like those giant robots. I really hope that it is not too late for Jay and I to start a club. Our last resort would be a Manga club, but there's gotta be more we could do. In any case, what I'm trying to get at is: BE MORE CONSIDERATE WHEN CHOOSING LEADERS, losers have feelings too. There is absolutely NO need to be playing monopoly with leadership positions. I just don't get it. That kind of thinking encourages unhealthy competition and  will  necessarily result in someone's lowering of self-esteem. We get it, you're an official, let's roll out the metaphorical red carpet, now give us a chance. Oh wait, I forgot about nepotism and oligarchy. Ohhh that just really burns me up. No matter, life goes on as it always does, with or without you.  _We can only hope for the best and look ahead past all the bullshit you have to deal with in your adolescence only to see the same process repeated through adulthood. It would seem right now, that the best choice to be successful, would be a musician. You could be in, then out, and rich. Gosh, if I could make just enough capital so that work wouldn't be heading down to the fund of general living costs, I would start getting more serious in manga as a hobby and maybe eventually, a career. I love the imagination the escapism it provides in a world where all you can do is escape (unless, that is, you're a leader, in which case, you can influence change). Just the stimulation of it. Not to mention, if you're good at it, the effect storytelling has on an audience. Until now, I had never really thought of why I liked watching anime or reading comics or books. Wow! isn't amazing on what a tangent I can go off? I didn't even finish my angry rant about colleges and then I get all optimistic suddenly! that isn't me! that's a lie! hahaha. _So, colleges. First of all, they're the first big step. the Gateway drugs. You'd probably end up overeducated anyways. Those in business, politics, cutthroat as they are, the arts (all forms), and technology are the ones making serious money. And while money may not buy happiness, it can buy time (since we know that "time is money"), and time can be spared for the search of happiness. Colleges are the first time that the sheep (for those not attending rich-ass private schools or just rich schools cuz' they live in rich areas) are segregated by grade A, AA, AAA, or 'suck'. Ohhh Ohhh, I'm writing too much, aren't I? Oh well, screw it. .hack// doesn't come on until 1:30 or something. And depending on what college you go to, the esteem of the college will determine what job positions on a hierarchy of limited social mobility you are qualified for. (If you don't mind prepositions at the end of sentences.) College (if and when I go *fingers crossed*, parents are making sure of that, whether it be Palomar Community college or Ivy league >_ amazing  in my life? Who knows? _One more thing before I go. I cannot type at all lately! I've been making so many errors like, switching "there"s with "their"s, or just plain missing keys. I don't know what exactly it is, but over summer I get extra stupid. My backspace/delete/back arrow keys are all being worn out. I've taken special strides so as not to mess up too poorly on this post, but oh well. I've been thinking of teaching myself how to speed type. It hasn't been going too well as of late. I'd also like to get into better shape, if not for other people and social pressures, at least for myself. I want to retain.... *be* healthy as an adult (>_
