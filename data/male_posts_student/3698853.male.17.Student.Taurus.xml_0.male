Most of the family's out of the house now, but yeah.... So I started by cleaning up the schoolwork. The recycling bin (the big blue one) is full to the rim, and the trash can is on its way. Lots of memories in some of the papers, but memories come and go. Vaccuumed too; let in some light and fresh air. Then I set to work on my clothes. My drawers were so messy before; now they're all organized; well for the most part, for now. Next, I suppose will be my closet, and then organizing my desk and the shelves that make up the head of my bed. Vaccuum in the area trapped between the bed and the wall. Dust  everything . Set everything straight. Hopefully, I'll be able to breathe more healthily in the nights to come. The goal was to not allow myself to get meningitis (>_ _I don't know if I want to go to my aunt's party because I have no idea what it's for! (XB) However, that's not uncommon for our family. I hardly know my family on my mother's side, just my close relatives like first cousins. On the other hand, I know most of my dad's side pretty well, mostly because they live in the vicinity of San Diego, whereas my mom's family is scattered all over California, Washington, Canada, Everywhere! Once I go to college, I wonder if I'll even have time for family... I definitely want to remain active; not for sports' sake, but for my own health. It's ridiculous how out of shape I am right now. I've been meaning to run in the mornings and sometimes at nights, but I've been kept awake by the creative writing bursts, which never seem to come at an appropriate or convenient time... _Eh... I started trying that idea I had of an oekaki comic strip for practice, but I didn't realize how much I sucked at it (>_ at least ). Once I get my driver's license, most of the worst complications will get cleared up, and I will be so happy. I've grown so tired of having to wait for my parents to pick me up all the time or bum rides off people or walking home. It's so stinky. _I hope this blog doesn't become a burden like the deadjournal did. It would get to the point like Mr. Kutzner's reflections, where I would have to force myself to think of something on which to reflect. With this blog, everything just seems to flow out onto the keyboard. *sigh*. Okay, mom left, so I'd better get back to cleaning. ~Spamu signing out!
