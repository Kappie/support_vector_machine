We watched   Objects In the Mirror   again.   And of course people did what I was afraid what they would do    "Where's Kate?"        "How are you guys?"    They don't seem to know yet, and I didnthave the desireto explain to them. I just told them we werent together at the moment. I havent heard from her since she talked to me online that one time. Hopefully she is having fun in Hawaii ( >_ *  green with envy*  ) and takin a break and thinking about things...   The band practice seemed to excite Evan, he told me once he gets back on wensday he wants to do two more practices and then jump into the studio that weekend! Well, I'm excited too, but I dont know if that would possibly work, so I said maybe we'd be better off leaving it to the following weekend.   Tomorrow, I'm pretty sure me ben and marty and brandon and maybe some others are gonna see Anchorman...   Toodles   If you want to listen toa hot track may I suggest  "Overexposure"  by  Blueprint 76    or  "Tomorrow and Today"  by the same band...that ones a nice cute dorky pop punk love song
