There are just times when I blame God for things. Especially when it comes back to things that I cherish that might have been more precious to me than God is. It's when we cherish something more than we love God that we would save this. Are our lives truly for Him. If our lives are for God, do we have a reason to blame Him? Instead, we should be rejoicing  in all circumstances.  This is a special lesson. Cause I was reminded of my life as I was doing my quiet time. Which coincidentally happened a day after I watch 'A Walk to Remember'. Where, Jamie Sullivan, a girl who's found the love of her life and at the same time, dying from lukemia. Maybe it seems typical. But actually, Jamie was a devout Christian. Her faith meant everything to her. But when she fell in love, she was afraid. Not of death, but the very fact of not being able to be with Landon, her love. She faced the possibilty of being angry with God, because she couldn't let go. She was ready for her death as she contracted lukemia more than two years ago, and had since lived with the knowledge of her pending death. But she was not afraid, and had trusted God. Until something she cherished alot came into her life. My challenge to you is that, have you truly given every part of your life to God? Is there something that you just can't let go? Just asked God to help you, and lay down the 'reason to be angry with God' before Him.  And don't worry Jamie and Landon got married and she gave it all to God. Instead for being troubled by it, she became an encouragement to her husband. Well, thank God for this wonderful story. Although they didn't exactly "live" happily ever after.  And as I was saying, I realised this during my exam period(which is still ongoing). This help me to trust God and to even "give my work" for His glory. You might want to read Colossians 3:18-4:1. It's a simple and straightforward passage, but hope it reminds you to approach each and every ordinary thing today with a sincerity of heart and reverence for God.   Amen?
