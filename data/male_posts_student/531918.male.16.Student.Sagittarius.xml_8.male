Read below for two examples of how wrong you are.  Google, being the evil conglomerate that they are, decided that they just don't do enough yet, so the brainchilds of that company have created their hellspawn.  It sends.  It receives.  It has a tacky name.  It is GMail.  That's right: GMail.  It's just like e-mail, but, you know, it starts with a "g".  Clever, no?  Also, I'm sure you've seen the latest video for Velvet Revolver's "Slither".  Don't get me wrong; it's a good song.  However, check out videos from a group called Bauhaus.  Check out the similarities.  Hmm.
