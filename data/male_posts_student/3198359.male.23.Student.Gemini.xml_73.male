Yeap, you've heard it, Microsofts shares are over valued, how can a business justify a share price of $30+ when the profits just don't add up?     Maybe its just me, but I subscribe to the old fashioned purchasing shares for long term investment rather than this modern day gambling like stock exchange situation where there is rapid swings of $5.
