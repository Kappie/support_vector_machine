Perhaps Live Journal has some kind of issue with copyright; I don't know. It does suggest that blogs are better than LJs though. Get through the complications and it's clear sailing is what's suggested. It'd be nice to have a good-looking blog, but sadly my HTML, web-publishing etc. etc. skillz aren't particularly l33t...
