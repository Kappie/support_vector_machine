Anyway, I guess i should do a small introduction first, because you deserve to know what you are getting into by reading this. Basically, im just going to use it as a kind of diary, but with some more interesting things thrown in as well. Im doing it because i thought it might be a good way to relive some stress (because sharing is healthy), and i could use some stress relief about now (but more on that later). If you are wondering whether this blog is just going to be me moaning about my life then allow me to set your mind at ease... that is exactly what it is going to be. If you dont like the sound of that you dont have to read any furthur, but if you could do with a laugh and think reading about someone elses misfortunes would cheer you up, then please read on. Thats about it for the first post, but ill get back to you soon. P.S I appologise in advance for my terrible spelling and grammer.
