At first I debated with myself whether or not to stoop that low, but then I realized:  This is a  blog .  That's what they're  for .  Today's post is, as usual, a review:   Troll Hallikk, March Through The Streets,  Terremoto @ Some dude's basement   Last things first, Terremoto, while purporting to be a metal band, in fact churn out massive doses of low-energy Don Caballero-baiting math rock.  They are boring to watch and I left after three songs.  Sue me, I was tired.  Terremoto were preceded by March Through The Streets, who, if the name does not give you enough of a hint, are a Spirit-of-'77 punk band.  They're pretty decent, and their guitar solos put most of the songs over where the lyrics fail, and fail they do because they're all about the goddamn "kids".  Nice guys, though.  Opening the set were Troll Hallikk, who rocked.  And I'm not just saying that because they're my band.  See, about a week before, I was hanging out with this guy Rick and some other people, and somebody announced that there was going to be a party at his house the following week.  I immediately offered my services and drafted Rick on drums.  This is not the first time I have jumped the bill with a nonexistent band.  (Several years ago the Heshers were visited on an unsuspecting New Year's Eve party in identical fashion.)  The Troll Hallikk brief is this:  Spirit-crushing, stoned-out doom metal sung in Norwegian and played by two straight edge dudes.  By the time of the show, we had worked up four songs (enough, in Doom Metal World, for a full 45-minute set, but we economized), the titles of which are "Vi må flykte fra ulvene" ("We must flee from the wolves"), "Todd fra 7-11 er ondets kong" ("Todd from the 7-11 is the king of evil"), "Satans bil er jævla søt" ("Satan's car is fucking sweet"), and "Jeg elsker min lille katten" ("I love my kitty-cat").  The name Troll Hallikk itself is a stupid pun, but the only part you'll need to know is that it means "Troll Pimp".  How good were we?  We were good enough, evidently, that within five minutes of the end of our set we had recruited, without my knowledge, two new vocalists.  Never mind that I wasn't consulted.  Never mind that neither of them can speak fucking Norwegian, and therefore cannot sing the fucking songs.  Never mind that a bassist, or maybe a second guitarist, would have been a more appropriate addition.  Also, apparently we got asked to play another show.
