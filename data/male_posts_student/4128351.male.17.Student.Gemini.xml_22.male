I picked Dad up for lunch and we had a heart-to-heart for close to two hours over Subway.  Alot of things were resolved.  It was alright.      I went home and to New Haven, and home, and to New Haven, and home, and to New Haven.       I listened to Ryan Adams alot.  He breaks my heart.        I thought the day would end without me seeing your smile, but somehow I was lucky.  I was blessed to gaze into your eyes, you refresh me.  Just ten minutes in your prescence makes me feel alive.       I love you.       Me and Jamin and Dustin and Tory went to Wendy's together.  Dustin and Tory never showed up here though, I think they're having sex or something.       Me and Jamin hooked up his new 4-Track Recorder and messed around til' about now.        It's 3:27 AM.        I talked to Jami around 1 AM, she was worrying about her mom and things that happened in the past.  I told her that she didn't need to worry about that any more, that it's different now, and that I'm always ALWAYS here for her, no matter what.  I'm in love with her.       I'm going to go hang out with Jamin some more before he goes back to VA.        Goodnight.      Tonight's Song to Illegally Steal Off Kazaa is: "All Along the Watchtower" by Holt Barnitz and Jamin Riley.        Wait... we just recorded that one about an hour ago, you'll have to wait til' next week to download it.  ;)      I love you.      Keep cool my babies.
