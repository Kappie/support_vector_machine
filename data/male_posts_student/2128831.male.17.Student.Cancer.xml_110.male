I can see Sunday from here, but for now, it's a beautiful sight. Long week, short weekend. But I'll take it anyway. For the record, it's all sad and lonely here around the school without Scottshead. He went to Coachella. That dirty, rotten, stinky bass turd. But that's ok, I have my newfound fascination with Klausa Nomi to keep me busy. I'm fascinated. No, really. We watched "Urgh! A Music War" last night, and poor dead Klaus was ahead of his time. So far in fact that he could probably never really fit in anywhere in the concept of human time. To me, that's fascinating.  But then again, I was that weird kid who bought the broken toys in the store because I felt sorry no one would buy them. And finally... Hmm. I'm not exactly sure why the obesity rate is skyrocketing in America these days.  Maybe it's a mindset that doesn't just celebrate something's arrival every 17 years with a parade or just by observing wistfully, instead we figure out how to make tacos out of them. "The cicadas are comin' the cicadas are comin', grab a fork and some BUTTER!"   Today's aphorism, and another useless tagline from the past.  " Say what you will about professional killers, they get their 'To Do lists' done." "Ball Park Franks. They plump when you cook 'em."  Remember, kids. Someone got paid for writing that tagline. Maybe it was Darrin Stevens right after Mr. Tate died and the Associate VPs cleaned house, firing Darrin after 20 years of his blood, sweat and tears, only to replace him with a cheaper, fresher *ad jockey*. Advertising doesn't make you bitter. No, really.  Aw, life is good, and not all advertising is bad for you, as long as you can handle the truth -- so here's a piece of candy that'll rot somebody else's teeth for a change and not yours.  Enjoy! Ps: As always, your aphorism contributions are welcomed here. If I can only remember to check my email. Must... remember..   M's are cruelty-free.  Things that make me a frownie-puss:  -- hitting the ground running -- being asked what is on my plate -- 004dk.eos.net.FtpError: login error messages -- hurting someone's feelings. unless i really can't stand them. -- being allergic to serotonin reuptake inhibitors in this day and age -- hearing the words "frownie" and "puss" used together by an adult -- the word "giggly"   Things that make me a giggly-fool:  -- thinking about owning a cheese shop with an adjacent wine bar -- eating an ice cream cone under the Eiffel Tower -- being fitter, happier, more productive -- red, green, yellow and blue M -- Christine, for fixing the 004dk.eos.net.FtpError: login error -- sitting in the middle of 5,000 people singing Weird Al's "Amish Paradise"* -- sitting in the middle of 5,000 people singing Weird Al's "Fat"** -- sitting in the middle of 5,000 people singing Weird Al's "Yoda"*** *Sometimes life is good. **But it's better when it's *** really good.   Rescue?  The average ambulance response time is ten minutes and forty-nine seconds. From the moment the call is routed through to emergency medical services, to the arrival on the scene, it takes ten minutes and forty-nine seconds. Turning over the engine, pulling out onto the street, using a radio transmitter to change red lights green, and traveling an average of fifty-eight miles an hour. Ten minutes and forty-nine seconds. Remember that number, because that is how long you will have to hold on to your life. That is exactly how stubborn you have to be in order to survive a car crash. An overdose. A heart attack. Every minute that passes by reduces the survival rate of a cardiac arrest patient by ten percent. Every minute you are laying on the ground unconscious, you are one tenth closer to death. Electrical signals start sending themselves more rapidly to your heart, causing it to run a race it can't win. It begins to limp along, and you lose vision momentarily. Parts of your body begin to feel strangely surreal. Arrhythmia sets in and your heart trips over its shoelaces, refusing to get back up off its knees. You collapse in your kitchen, your bathtub, your patio. If you're keeping track, the average ambulance on the average day with the average patient ends in an average funeral. When your lungs collapse from a sudden blow to the chest, cardiac arrest sets in. Electrocution, drowning, choking, and sudden blows to the heart. Ten minutes and forty-nine seconds after you forgot to turn the power off at the breaker box, the ambulance arrives at your household and puts you on a gurney. For the entire ten minute ride back to the emergency room, they send electric pulses through your chest, attempting to restart your heart artificially. Deus ex Machina in full effect, flying down the road at sixty miles an hour. When you arrive at the emergency room, a doctor and three nurses spend another four to six minutes attempting to shock you back to life. After the required number of attempts, the doctor pronounces time of death and signs off on your life. We are brought into this world with a certificate, it seems only fitting that we leave with one.
