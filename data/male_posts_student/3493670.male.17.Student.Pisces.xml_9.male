Woke up at 8:33 am. My diva of a dog named BB has been barking nonstop and my mom woke me up toput her on a leash. Suddenly, I got to thinking about the true meaning of Diva. The word has been devalued of its meaning because of rampant misuse. Its has been synonymous to the other overused word, Bitch.   I stared at myself in the mirror and looked at myself wondering what I have become, I've been asking myself lots of questions lately. Am I misunderstood or are they the one misunderstood by me. Are we both wrong? Or Am I just wrong but I simply refuse to concede defeat? Or are we both wrong but they don't concede defeat because they're older?*closes eyes for a sec to think* I wouldn't really know where to start. Sometimes, when I look at myself in the mirror, I actually led myself to believe that I'd see someone worthwhile. But now, I was wrong. I see nothing. Nothing.   Once again I asked myself if I am bad. I can't even come up with an answer. Am I naturally bad? Because there is such a thing as naturally bastardly. Maybe thats me. Maybe I just need some time to find myself once again. How many times does one person actually have to find himself? But one thing's for sure. I am so sick of having to explain and justify my actions and actually getting my point across.  Pagod na ko  (I'm tired of doing that). But on view of what just happened recently, maybe its better to just ignore them. But then again, as you shut up an reach the end of your patience, you lash out. But lashing out all the time is actually worse.   I got to thinking about Respect. Is it something that you must command? Or is it something that you actually have to earn? My brain aint functioning properly so I can't come up with an answer to that. Or maybe there's no precise answer to that because they can both be right. Both has it share of pros and cons. *gripshair in utter irritation*   The minute I get the answers to my questions, I'll let you know.
