I'm flying out tomorrow so I've got a ton of shit to do. Will head out to Super Target in a bit, then finally get my ass to the gym to abuse my chest and shoulders. Decided against working legs this week because I really don't want to walk around Vegas like an old cripple with a stick up his ass. Also need to decide what to do with Bitsy while we're away. Will probably end up leaving her at some pet hotel or whatever. Mo money, mo money, mo money..damn. Oh well, must not think about it. I'm determined to have a kickass time this weekend while NOT thinking about how much debt I'll be racking up. It's only money right?
