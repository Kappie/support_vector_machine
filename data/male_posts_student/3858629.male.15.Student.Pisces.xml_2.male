Caitlin, Alicia, Emily, and Meghan came too and stayed until about 11:00. I had wanted Holly to come over, even though she and Meghan aren't getting along so well right now. Holly and I were best friends and I miss that about us, but I did talk to her for a while last night and it felt like nothing had changed. Maybe...  When I awoke though, I forgot completely that anyone was here because I had been having a rather pleasant dream (though I don't recall its subject now) when the phone rang. It was Joe, Jason's father, asking if he was here. So I had to wake Jason, and that's when I remembered people were here.  After getting showered and dressed, my mom took me to get my haircut. It's considerably shorter now, even though it wasn't that long. I guess it's good, because it would have grown in Florida and my hair combined with humidity is a result the likes of Monica in the last two episodes of the ninth season of 'Friends'.  Even though I don't pay for my hair to be cut (my parents do) I was a little surprised the fee was raised to $25.00, but I really like the way it's cut, and I like talking to Andrea and Flo about movies, and one of them usually cuts my hair.  My mom and I went to visit my great aunt (whom I call "Grandma" and will from here on be referred to as my grandmother) at her house, after my hair was cut. She gave me money for my report card to bring to Florida, which I don't understand because she's given me money "for my report card" multiple times now and since  she  is taking me to Florida, she'll probably pay for everything I really need or want there.  Now I'm preparing to go to work, which is something I don't want to do. It's not going to busy and I'm going to be bored, but at least I can talk to Stephanie a little bit, which is always good as she's the only truly interesting person there, other than maybe Ashley Dilley.  When I come home, I'm thinking I'll have my parents pick me up because I can walk home in two minutes, but there's a party going on at my neighbors' house and I'd feel awkward passing it on the way home. Of course, my parents may be there already, since we were actually invited for once...
