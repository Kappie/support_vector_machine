You see ar, the Charmed ones are having a series of dreams (problematic ones to be exact). And guess what? I was able to diagnose, very accurately, the significance of their dreams. I am so proud of myself! My Charmed knowledge has not been wasted learning! :)  Alright. Today we had Bio, both papers. On the whole, it was easy. Only had some problems with a few questions, but I found myself enoying both papers. HaHa! Easy ma....even everybody said it was easy. :) You know, I was utterly bored throughout thw whole 2 papers.I finished about half an hour early for both papers, and I was stuck with nothing to do. So, I turned to observing the teachers in front of me. The Chief Examiner in particular. He has no rings on his finger. Is he single? I see many teachers with rings...except him. HaHa!! I am so pervertic...but hey! I am bored. I also wrote a poem, which I will post later. It's a LONG one.  After exams, we went to LJS to eat! I was cheated!! The guy spoke so fast...I only heard "salad or fries" in the end. Of course I chose fries. But!! The total turned out to be $4.90! Wayyyyy more than what I originally planned! I was so cheated! How could they cheat customers?!!! CQ also didn't understand, but he learnt from me and said "no no no" to everything. And he didn't get cheated! This is so unfair. Next time, if they dare to mumble again, I say loudly "No to everything! Normal meal that cost $3.60!!". Ayioh!! And hor, I met Wendy, YiChun, Amanda and Wendy. I stayed for a while to wait for Net to finish eating. After that, we went home lor.  Okay...I basically relaxed today. I played games ar, surfed the Net ar. Yeah la. I will only start revision tomorrow, starting with Chem. I am invitng WQ over to study lor. So afraid he won't study...and also I want accompaniment! Hehe! Must socre well in Chem, KY!  Okie....I think I should end le! Ehh! Not without posting my poem first! Presenting....    Choir   Tee Tee Tee Tuka Ton. Do you rememeber? Or from your memories gone?
