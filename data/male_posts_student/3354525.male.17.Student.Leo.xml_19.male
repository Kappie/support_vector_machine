The weather couldn't have been any better and it was nice to meet his grandparents and some family friends. Again, anotherbig thanks from Nathaniel and I go to Brent and his parents for having us up there for the 3 days. All 3 of us are pretty sunburnt, especially Brent lol. Warm water, great food, YA YA!! Brent played his guitar and sang "Picture" by Cheryl Crow and Kid Rockwith Nathaniel to a bunch of people in the rec hall, it was a great show.... "So luxurious!"   So, besides Nathaniel and I cranking the tunes in the car, the swimming, and all the good eating.. it couldn't possibly have been a bettertrip.  Until next time...  CK out.
