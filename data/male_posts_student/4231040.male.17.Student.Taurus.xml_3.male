I can't quote everything she said but you can imagine that these teachers are grilling me like meat, anyway Eloi, the research teacher, told me I won't be recieving my Certificate of Good Moral ( Goddamit!   They really doesn't get it do they?,  I told myself, by doing this they're just proving my so-called 'slander' true) and that I will also be kicked out from The Isotopes (that's  our  schoolpaper, if you don't know), but that's where they crossed the line, they can do to me whatever they want but they can't kick me out of my only outlet of releasing inner angst... but since they\re my teachers (stupid hypocrites, though they are) I couldn't do anything but accept their decree, talk about power struggles,anyhow I walked away from what was unmistakably their maniacal laughter.
