Now I'm finally taking off for graduate school. It's amazing. No more Culver Drive, no more Yale loop, no more lots of things. Naomi said she's going to take me out for a drink tonight and Flo said we'll try to meet up for dinner tonight. Lots of goodbyes coming up.  Things I still need to do clean my room, pack and maybe go to the beach.  In rotation right now  Propagandhi 's "Anchorless."  ***
