She's got lots of friends, she goes to clubs, she wears clothes that are fashionable without being derivative, and she knows all the best places to eat.  It's not really much of a surprise that she's the kind of person that people tend to gravitate to, while I'm more the kind of person that ought to be enlisted into performing presidential assassinations on account of my ability to go completely unnoticed (not always by choice, mind you).  Yeah, she's a really cool girl, but as she gets older, it seems that the kinks in her trendy facade are becoming more and more apparent.  My sister's recent visit really cast a spotlight on a lot of the things that, in order to be popular, my sister has had to compromise on.    Her stay was meant to be one month in length, during which my mother really hoped to have the family spend time together, something that was a rarity even when my sister was in the country.  However, due partly to my schedule, but even more so to my sister's unwillingness to sacrifice any part of her social agenda, we did not even spend one single day, not eight consecutive hours, together as a family.  Rather, she'd go out to meet friends, go shopping, and she went to Montreal and New York.  Not that I'd begrudge her a good time, but my parents, they're not young, and I know once they're gone, she'll regret not having spent more time with them.  In fact, I know that she knows that she will have these regrets, yet the lure of the social butterfly is too overwhelming for her.  My mother asked my sister to join her, my father, and myself on a trip to Niagara Falls, but my sister was too tired from having gone out the night before, and she had made plans for later that day.  Whatever plans she had made, they surely could not amount to what she had missed.  When the Maid of the Mist sailed into the spray of the Falls, the expression on my mother's face, the joy that shone from her beaming smile, is one that I will never forget, and so powerful an image that the picture I took of it pales in comparison to the memory I have.    When my parents have passed, I wonder what regrets my sister will confide in me, and I know as I listen, I will wonder how much of her grief could have been avoided had she not been so selfish.
