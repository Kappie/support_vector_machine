While in my youth, I choose to slumber in the dwelling place that i call my bedroom for extensive amounts of time. How I spend 11 hours of my day in this is unknown, but it is certain that i find peace. Surely this is hard to come by with my intense summer agenda. Sarcasm. I do seek activities to bore myself with. This assists me to pass the time by.  //The previous paragraph was a whole bunch of nothin, but it was fun to write. I woke up today around 12:14, and sat around for a while. I took a shower after laying in bed for another twenty minutes. I was renewed and felt alive. I grabbed some clothes picked up my guitar. I played it for a while and heard a noise that was not coming from my mouth nor my guitar. It was my stomach aching for food. I start a lot of sentences with i. I put my contacts on, grabbed my wallet and keys, and left for the Burger Hut. Oh how i love those cheese steaks. They are rather greasy, but my body craved for two of them and a Sundrop. Nirvana.  //Went to a friends house today and stayed for a while. Matt and i discussed a lot of subjects. Most pertaining to black holes, school, and electronics. Matt is my bud that i can talk to in my county about this stuff. He can relate to the situations i face when my master boot record has failed on me or when i need to flash my BIOS. He is a great guy.  //Went out to Hallsboro and to Whiteville to rent a movie to watch. Mary Grace and I saw "The Perfect Score." It was about these High School Seniors who wanted to break into the College Board building and steal the answers to the SAT. I still dont know how they got past security, but they did. I would give this movie 2 1/2 out of 4 stars. The acting really sucked, but the idea behind the movie was pretty cleaver. It gives me some ideas. hehe. If anyone who reads this wants to help me steal the answers to the SAT, IM me at thelastsnleft853 through AIM. I need a crew. It did give me a realization that i needed to spend more time with SAT prep books. My score isnt that great, and i need to raise it a lil more.  //Thanks again for reading this blog. This is number three i think. its really becoming habitual. I might not post until sunday night or monday night. im goin outa town to see my brother's family. Its been great. Im out. Night. ++++++
