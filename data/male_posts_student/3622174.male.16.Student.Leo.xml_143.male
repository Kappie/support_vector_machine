Yeah, I've only got two *Real* thinking classes, but, still, today dragged on, and I'm too tired to try and think.  And I have homework.  Gee, this school year sure is going to suck, isn't it?  Economics, especially...everything basically went in one ear and out the other.  Sometimes, I just didn't even bother letting it go in one ear.  Spanish...she's still evil, and she continued her long list of rules today by talking about passes and crap.  At one point, she was like "DO NOT request to go to another teacher's class.  Last year I had one student in my class that kept leaving for yearbook..."  As soon as she said yearbook, my pen dug into my paper, and the whole paper ripped, causing people to stare me down.  Obviously, I'm on yearbook, and it was ME who went to go get Adam, the student she was mainly referring to, out of class for yearbook purposes.  So, that was definitely not a good thing.  I think that's all I've got for now.  I'll be back later tonight with stuff.  Bye for now.
