Good riddence, Comcast is beginning to get on my nerves not letting me have multiple computers on my network. The bastards! Any yes I did try everything, even changed my router, to no avail.  I went to a "party" last night with parents, man I was bored as fuck, all the dad's looked the friggin same, come on can't you come up with a new fashion trend? But my dad was not part of that so I'm happy, were always out of the norm.  My cuz's dad was like we all need to move to India, hell no! I'm not moving there now, after all that I've accomplished. Screw that! Life's a bore!   Well this post is out of the norm as well since I usually write when I'm fucking depressed! I should eat and do my portfolio.....ummm....shit!  Anyways will write later and add more pictures, fuck yea! Man I fucking curse a fucking lot. :p It just lets out the fucking pressure. LOL
