Anyways i've got a new book that teaches objective-c and I'm reading as much as I can. objective-c is language for making good programs in mac with the cocoa frame works which let you create powerful applications that can easily have GUIs. Also i have been reading my mac os x panther unleashed a lot. i skipped to the BSD subsystem which is about like all the "behind the scenes" stuff which the graphics of panther cover up and work with. I'm on the chapter about advanced shell concepts and commands.
