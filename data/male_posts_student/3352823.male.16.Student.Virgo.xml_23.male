I wanna get Lisence to Ill next, which I think I'll purchase when I preorder Star Wars the next time I get paid. I'm such a geek eh.   In awesome news; I went to the opticians today. My optician looks remarkably like Jimmy Fallon from SNL fame. Anyways, I'm getting new glasses and..... dun dun dunnnnn contacts!!! YAY! I can't wait. I have an appointment tomorrow to learn how to put them on and what not. Apparently they're a pain for a while. Meh. We'll see. I'm just trying them for a month and then well'll see what happens thereafter. I don' think they're too expensive either. Well I hope not.   I saw Spirited Away last night. Man that movie was awesome! I wasn't too partial to the visuals, nor the characters... Well I was sorta. But I LOVED the story. The story just knocked me off my feet. It really suffered from the fact that it was a TERRIBLE dub. Boo-urns on that. Oh well. Disney can kiss my ars--oh hey that's all the time we have today. So long!
