Anyway, this is my Blog, and I am SiberDrac.  That is, the electronic impersonation of me.  The reason I have not posted my name is that if I did, you might find me, which would lead to… bad happenings.  So there.  I'm just as paranoid as the people hunting me behind my back…  Fell free to post on my Blog.  Because it's mine.  Have fun.
