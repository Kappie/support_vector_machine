Firstly, And im being honest here, This is my first interaction with females over here...Excluding my Family/Relatives/Teachers.Yeh.It was kinda freaky...Expecially when half the class is females... The big question is why is this the first time? Simple. Duh... I had been in All-male School for 10 years...No interaction with females at all.Furthermore, Im a very Lazy/Anti-social/Timid little pussy who doesn't really like to go out and socialise... Lastly, I dont trust females...Its not that Im a Chuvinist Pig {how the fuck do you spell that? ) Its just that i have my own P/C reason. Yeh chill. Only a couple of my friends know the main reason behind that! I aint gonna list who they are.  All right, Lets get back to the O...The new people in My Class BI0408 are pretty cool too.Now Now lets list a couple.  Wee Kiat - Bloody fucking moronic Joker...He can pretty much fuck me to hell man...Thank the lord that Im still alive and able to relate this to you guys...  W.E.N - Thats his nick. Fuck me if Im wrong. I believe that his name is spelled as Soo Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat. Kinda cool,Quiet as most time though. Not to forget, he's from Thailand.  Ardurey - Fuck me again if Im wrong.Looks bloody rich to me though. Rather cool. Hes more like the brain in the group, giving suggestions and such.From Indonesia? I guess...  Verene - Ah just call her marine. AH they are the fucking same pronounciation.Fucking Talkative man. Doesnt really think much when talking with others..."ehh u know ahhhhhh hoorrrr ah yahhhhhhh ahhhhhhhh" My first impression of her was like " What the FUCK? "Honestly, She reminded me of those typical aunties in the wet market...Gossiping/bargaining away...But on the whole, Shes still all right. I kinda feel that shes gonna be a good mother in the future though...COS SHES AN AUNTIE MUAHHAHAHHAHAHHAA.  Rest - Im a fucking failure for not knowing them enough...Yeh fuck you, dont remind me.  Jesus fucking christ... EDMUND SIM WEI SHENG IS MY CLASS MATE...like for the next 3 years? What the fuck is this bullshit? God so what now? NS same plootoon? Same Company? Husband and Wife? Same Date of death? Etc...Fuck that!   First day of O was kinda boring. I cant remember why...  Second day of O was Fucked up. Why. Fucking Good question You pinhead. 10 months ago. I dropped A maths cos' i really fucking hate it so much. AH for fuck sake, That subject is for my future worker yeh...Why? To count how much I deduct their pay...Cool huh...use A maths for such simple calculations....10 months later, And the horror relives...I got to take A maths. Cool huh... Well done Ashley Shen. If thats not cool enough...Guess what happens next.Fuck. Exam the next day. WOOOHOOOOO No way am i gonna pass for that crap. Nothing much really happen after the lecture/tutorial i had on the second day...  Third day. Fine, I copied for A maths. Cool.But whats most important on that day was actually the 'THE FINALE' Concert...Cool/boring at the same time. Why? Simple, Never really liked amatuers playing rock music....Fucking gay and lame... And so thats pretty much.My sincere apologies if this entry is rather lame. Well get this clear Wussy. To many things happened...I cant fucking remember.And yes. Fuck You. THis is my blog yeh?
