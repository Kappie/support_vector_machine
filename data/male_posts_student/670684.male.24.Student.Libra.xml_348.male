So I moved to the bed, flipped through some channels, found that  urlLink Pretty in Pink  was the TBS Dinner  A Movie (that started after 10...who knew?), watched it through the end (I can do that with  urlLink Shawshank Redemption  and any John Hughes film, no matter where I come in on it), and realized two hours later that I was still not working.  So now it's to the makeshift papazan (such egregious spelling), where I'll screw around at IMDB until I decide that early bed means drums tomorrow.    An ex girlfriend commented that she liked the old blog better.  I'm not sure what she meant...this is the old blog.  But looking through some of the recent posts, they do strike as illuminated pedestrian prose.  Nothing too exciting.  I chalk it to the movie writing...I focus on a script, and the blog becomes secondary when the pages are flowing.  While I want to write multiple works at a time and keep an intriguing blog, it might not be possible.  Or she's wrong.    Movies don't really address twentysomethings in any realistic manner.  You get things like COYOTE UGLY or 40 DAYS, where a hyperreal sexuality exists and every motherfucker is getting laid every night, because that's standard life outside college, yo.  But you don't get anything that makes a twentysomething have that deep stomach memory where the hairs stand on the forearms and you're ashamed that this is moving you even though you love the feeling, and all you can say is  Yeah, I remember that.   I kind of remember a night at 311 where I did some crazy dancing with most singles in the place while the 70s soul cover band threw out their KC  Sunshine Band bests, but it ended like most every other bar night I experience...walk out of the place, hike to the car, throw up the deuce, and head back to the place.  This night in particular I walked with a Debbie Harry lookalike, which longtime friends will know was a dream of mine, to sleep with Blondie, except this girl in particular started the night looking like the hip pop-punk 1970s Debbie Harry who nailed bandmates in the bathroom of CBGBs, and as the drinks progressed and the night grew on she aged into the present-day,  urlLink Six Ways to Sunday  Debbie Harry (btw, who knew that Debbie Harry is almost 60?)...and while I enjoyed their most recent album, the look isn't becoming for a 21 year old who I was later told has a penchant for the hourly rate room at the I-35 and Dean Keeton Days Inn.    Of course, I don't know if high school coming-of-age stories really address the honest situation of life as a teen.  I want to say it does, but I also romanticize my life to have some deeper meaning like I thought every John Hughes film had when I was 16 and made watching  urlLink St. Elmo's Fire  a requisite date.  A girl I worked with at Starbucks back in the day said that  Pretty in Pink  ruined her senior prom, for reasons she never divulged...so there is a connection, but how honest?  I never went to a party in high school that was anything like the Kelly LeBrock bash in  urlLink Weird Science  (the girlfriend mentioned earlier used to spell weird as  wierd , keeping with the  i before e  rule...actually, why is weird spelled like that?)...dances were kind of like the last one in  urlLink Footloose , but school was never as awe-inspiring as class and life seemed in  urlLink Fame .    Looks like I'm in the mood for parentheticals and links to 80s films.    I only think about this because while watching the film, Annie Potts line about wishing that you would start old and get younger...it resonated for the first time.  Great line in the middle of an otherwise throwaway scene.  I'm only 24, and I do understand how young that is, and I had one hell of a high school experience...but some nights I wish I could wake up in that captain's bed on 1104 W. New Hope, roll into the shower, drive the 1972 green Volvo stationwagon to the gravel parking lot, get out of class at noon, get on a school bus with the debate team, and head to Little Rock to argue with people and make fun of them once it was over...and then stay up all night first out in Little Rock and then pursuing every form of hotel hijinx possible in Arkansas.  Listening to Bennett Ryel turn mute the volume on the 700 Club and give Pat Robertson and his ladyfriends their own improv dialogue wouldn't hurt, either.    Of course, I couldn't wake up one morning and decide I was going to Corpus Christi for an afternoon of dirty Gulf swimming if I were back in HS.  You want to remember the good and forget that Mrs. Weeks taught the most god-awful Finite Math class in human history, that suffered the children an hour a day for 165 days.    Clare put a gallery of pics on her website...found one of me chatting up a few social workers in full Bob Harris garb.  Too bad I look like Alice Cooper.
