GRR  I fell asleep on my bed with ice around it and with it elevated a bit (following the RICE guidlines of course) and woke up about an hour later and it felt great.  It reduced the swelling a lot and made me feel better :)  Mum got some bandage for it and it's doing ok now.  Hopefully it will be better for Sam's sleepover this weekend, if there is one that is.  Make your mind up! lol  I'm off now... ta ta
