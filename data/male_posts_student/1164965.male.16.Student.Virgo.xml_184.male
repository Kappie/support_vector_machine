I don't quite know what to say, there really isn't a whole lot of controversial stuff to talk about here like there is in Clark's class.  What is everyone doing their Junior Project on?  I'm doing how disgusting and unhealthy school food is, because honestly...yuck!  The deep fried fries and extremely greasy pizza everyday, that needs to stop eventually.  Paul, I totally agree with you about how it's hard to keep your mind engaged on school when you do nothing in other classes...ah!  I don't know what to do with myself, I have absolutely no motivation to do anything.  What a great attitude, right? Haha.  Anyway, I'll see all you kids at school tomorrow!
