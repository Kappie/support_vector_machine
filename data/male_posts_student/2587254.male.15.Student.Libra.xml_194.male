We don't exactly know what yet, but it will be awesome I can already see that =P. The idea of two churches coming together to figure out something cool to bring in new believers, what could POSSIBLY go wrong =)? Nothing my point being, so HAH!    So my day started off with me getting up around 1130am or so, and then headed downstairs for breakfast. I had the ever so healthy sausage and egg McMuffin from McD's, two of them, and mmm they were good haha. Afterwards, I basically sat around for 30 minutes or so, and then had to head out to volunteer work at Cherryhill.    Tech tutored from 1-3 again. Still my Tech Tutor shirt has not came in yet, so I did work with only a volunteer tag. Yeah I know it sucks we don't even get real name tags, but oh well =P. Today didn't really do much, slow day. Answered two questions about the internet, and that's about where it ended. Josh came around 245 to wait, and also annoy me simultaneously. Meh didn't matter anyways. By the time my shift was almost over, 4 people were on Yahoo! games, and only two people were actually doing something. Anyways after my shift was done, mom came to pick Josh and I up to go to WLAC. I took out the 5th book of the Left Behind Series, which is called Appolyon or somethin', and then we made a sidestop at Angelo's for food.    I got an ice cap and Pizza. Josh got rice and perogies. Then mom bought a stock of cookies and some organic pear juice *shrug.* It's ok, but a bit too sweet. Anyways, after that stop, and eating a bit, we then went to WLAC and met Graham, their youth pastor.    He's much younger than our english pastor Dale, so yeah I guess it was easier to talk to him. Plus he knew someone that is part of Thousand Foot Krutch, which is COOL. So yeah, we discussed stuff, and eventually we came up with some ideas and then thought we should maybe get the two youth groups to meet one another before anything else happens. So eventually, we agreed on a meeting of the two groups, and also making a planning committee for the events that are to follow. Apparently the pastor's gettin' married *congratulations!* early November, so our first mini-coffeehouse can't be held until late November. Oh well, that's awhile down the road anyways, so we got time =P.    So after meeting and talking over our ideas, with some new ones thrown in, we then walked to my place, typed up an email and sent it to the HYPE counselors, then Josh's mom came and took him home. I then talked on MSN for a bit, beat Jenn in a game of hexic, and then grabbed a quick bite to eat.    Afterwards, went to the UCC for the first time in AGES to session.    Bottom line, I'm horrible now. So met Calvin there, no one else was there yet so we sessioned upstairs on our own for a bit. After about 30 minutes, we decided to migrate downstairs, but a fire alarm would change that. When Calvin we were about to go to basement, Calvin then stuck his foot out to play around with the door sensors, then a fire alarm went off. It was kinda funny since it looked like Calvin set it off, but I really doubt sticking your foot out to mock elevator sensors can trigger a fire alarm. So everyone had to evacuate, and then fire trucks and all came. We then saw FuFu, one of the members of CG there too, and after the whole commotion was over, we headed to basement to session. In the end there were 5 people sessioning tonight, and then I left with Calvin *he had a lift so I got one too* around 9pmish.    I'm here now, alive and well, and happy for today's turnout. We got something setup between WLAC and LCAC, I got to session again, and I can start reading a book now hahaha =).    OH and how could I forget! Pastor Kwong and Evelyn *his wife* have a new baby girl, Ingrid. So Samuel is now a big brother haha. Congratulations to them too =).    Later.
