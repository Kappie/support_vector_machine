She can't get it off. Isn't that sad??? But it's also very funny. So here's the rundown of my day. Before school I went to the art room and watched Kirsten make a pot. It was quite interesting. First hour it started to storm and I got scared. We watched a movie about volcanoes all hour. It was so boring. PUT ME TO SLEEP! We also did our drawing to see who one stuff. One of the prizes were her nice flower pens. Apparently she makes them herself! What a geeky person. She really thinks she's pretty cool though. Second hour we had to take stupid notes about cookies. I mean, lets just cook. It is a cooking class. During third hour I read my book because we were just going over stuff I already knew. I also helped Lizzie Ekum with her homework because she didn't understand it. Fourth hour we talked about our births. We had an assignment about that. At lunch we had a pizza party because our birthdays are in July and August. It was pretty good. On our way up to the party Mr. Bernhagen was walking in front of us and I said, "My knee hurts where I ran into the computer desk." Mr. Bernhagen turned around and gave me a really funny look. OH MY GOSH! So we had a nice mini convo with him about how I hit my knee on the computer desk. Speaking of teachers, I wonder what one would say if they read this blog. I just realized after I wrote about Thompson the other day that I am really mean but... it's so hard to break. I actually could sing during chorus today. It was fun actually. I love to sing. During sixth hour I scanned more pictures in for Mrs. Engels with Sarah and Katie. Mrs. Oberdas wouldn't leave us alone. It was so annoying. We started calling her Pizza Sr. That's when I got really hyper. Mr. Flanagan saw us and he asked us what we were doing so we told him. He got kind of excited and started striking up conversation with us. That was a bit annoyin to but... whatever. I can live with it. In English I wrote something really stupid on the computer. See we were in the lab because we had to type our essays or work on a research project but I just couldn't concentrate so I wrote about Lumberjack Bob. I'll post it on Monday while I'm at school. It's kind of funny but... it's kind of stupid too. It's pretty weird actually. That's when Mr. Flanagan told me I was weird and asked why. Look at the quotes page. Last hour we had the whole hour to work on our two pages of homework. Elizabeth and I got two problems done because we talked about random things. We even talked with Mrs. Brunner and she didn't care. We talked about our graduation outfits and embarassing moments and stuff. Then we went to homeroom at 3:05. We got our yearbooks. They are so cool. A lot of sexy faces in that. Kirsten and I have laughed all night at that. Then I went home with Kirsten. Mom then gave Melissa a ride to her house and went to the bank. I obviously went to. After dinner I went on the net and talked to Kirsten. She asked me if I could spend the night and so I asked and after a bit of begging Mom let me come. FUN! So I got here and we were going nuts laughing at stupid stuff. I kept hitting Kirsten's hands when she tried to type to people. While on the net we got in a fight with Kristine because she was gonna ditch us for Taylor's group. We already lost Lizzie this year and we don't want to lose another one. That's when the fun, hyper day didn't go too good. We then made up though. Now we are watching movies so I'm going to go watch. I love all the movies we plan to watch tonight. It's gonna be a lot of fun.
