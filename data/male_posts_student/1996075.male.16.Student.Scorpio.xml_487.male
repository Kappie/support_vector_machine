But I bet I've made mine even worse than all of you: I have to be at school at 9 for a debate thing.  Math time: 9 - 4(o'clock)=5 hours. -1 for breakfast shower and drive time = 4. -1 for misc. 3 hours of sleep! Yay!  -mikeo  "Laugh and the world laughs with you, snore and you sleep alone" - Anthony Burgess
