I almost caught the drummer from Ozzy, Whitesnake and Aerosmith's drum stick but it flew over my head and one landed the seat in front...and the raffles seemed to be the numbers around mine, so I'm the bad luck in the middle...but I got plenty of souvineers. Ya know, a LIDC hat, Zildian and Yamaha stickers, Sonny Emory and JR posters. All cool. But JR is scary looking so I'm not hanging him up. I hung Sonny up next to my drums because he was awesome. He was my favorite out of all three. He's from Earth Wind, and Fire and Steely Dan. This guy was amazing and since today some drummer like Elvon or something died he dedicated his life with this wackly sick ass drum solo that was like 20 minutes long. He was great. All funky and fast, the way I like em. So that's it for today. Can't wait for Friday, Bands of The Bull...it's gonna be fun helping the drummers set up, playing on all their equipment "to test if it's working" and hopefully you'll all see me perform. Certain people aren't sure if we're doing it yet but if we do I think it's gonna be during intermission. Ok, so until tomorrow, this is Wolf Four News...I am so lame.
