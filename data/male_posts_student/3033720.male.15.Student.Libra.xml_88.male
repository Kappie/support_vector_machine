This one girl who is going to be a freshman IMed me and asked if we had already done pictures, and when I asked her why, she said she had had appendicitis, so of course, even though I didn't even know her at the time, I had her call me, so now Jessica Ogle and I are friends I guess.   Now for the excititng part. Icaught my gay co-worker up to some shananagins with his "partner" in the back room at work today. If you want details, IM me or call.  I'll post later, stay classy, and I'm out.
