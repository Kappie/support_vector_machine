Maybe not exactly a nerd but sometimes it happens to normal people too!   Tomorrow is some celebration of racial harmony thing, so we are going to dress in ethinic costumes, so a few of us went over to friend's place to try out some stuff she had, i got this splendid looking suit, it was ravishing in cream and claret.   I when in to the room to try it on, and it looked gorgeous but not knowing quite how to wear it i did not realize the pants was missing since it looked complete so, sure i was not exposing anything but still, the shock when the more *enlightened* ones burst out into peals of laughter and started going where's your pants! It did not help that there were girls!!!   The feeling was terrible, a sunken sought of feeling, since i was not revealing any underwear or *stuff* it was not to bad but you just thought how it was going to be when you faced them. I was sweating it off, but they did me a favour and not laughed when i came out...   Whew, hope the gossip forum in class does not catch wind of this!
