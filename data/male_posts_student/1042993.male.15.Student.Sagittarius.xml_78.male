Since I do this, there is a chance that  if you are using Internet Explorer, you won't be able to view my counter correctly because IE disables .GIF files that require cookies in the latest update. The problem will persist until Microsoft releases its next patch for IE 6  or moves to IE 7.   If you can't see the counter, I invite you to switch to  urlLink Mozilla  Firefox , or my current favorite, My IE2. I love  urlLink MyIE2  because it combines the simplest features of Microsoft's IE with open source features from the makers of My IE2. Keep in mind that  neither of these are perfect, and neither is Internet Explorer, nor is any piece of software for that matter.   If you have any problems viewing my counter, or any other problems with my site,  please contact me  urlLink here .   I am currently playing (on the piano ;-)   urlLink Wonderful Grace of Jesus   .
