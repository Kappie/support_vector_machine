TheyÂve got their love torches burning When they should be playing it cool I used to laugh but now IÂm the same Take a look at a brand new fool Take a look at a brand new fool.  Fools fall in love. Jennifer Holliday.     When somebody loved me everything was beautiful, every hour we spent together lives within my heart... too much drama, this is my way of healling. Dude, you really hurt me, like nobody did before, and the thing I hate the most is that I don't care... I still love you with all my damn heart... fuck, if being your friend is all I can have, hell, whatever it takes... even though it will hurt. For what it was worth, it was worth all the while... just hope you still care for me.
