       
      Understand my heart. Can you? Will You? Try to see. The hope for a future. A hope to be me.  The days to fill And nights to rest. What could be better, What could be best?  To breathe deep,  To laugh loud. To hope for the unbelievable, unconceivable â€“ Only the imaginable.  Perfection, protection, transportation and time- My heart understood, A life so sublime.
