I almost start thinking that it's not so pathetic, after all. And then I see stuff like this. The News-Review publishes The Currents once a week, which it describes as "The News-Review's guide to arts, entertainment, and television." I checked some movie times and then flicked over to the weekly calendar. Oh boy. Let's see, how many times is karaoke listed as an event on these two pages? Let me count ... 14 different karaokes going on this week alone. But it gets better. There's all kinds of weird stuff happening. Like the "SOLID GOLD DOO-WOP." I have no idea what that is, except that it's happening a couple times at Seven Feathers. Oh here we go: "THE ART OF TIE-DYING" was at Mystic Earth on Friday. Shoot, I missed it. How about "BELLY DANCING" at Alexander's Greek Cuisine? Bring the wife and kids! "SUMMER TROLLEY THROUGH WINE COUNTRY." All-day tour of local vineyards. Also known as "OLD PEOPLE DRINKING FAR TOO MUCH WINE AND GETTING SO CRAZY DRUNK THAT WE DRIVE THEM AROUND ... UNTIL THE RIDE'S OVER AND THEY ALL DRIVE HOME." Shoot, missed that one too. I think this one is my favorite, though: "RUPERT LOOK-ALIKE CONTEST." (You know, the fat pirate guy from Survivor.) There's no need to make fun of this, I'll just type out what it says here: "RUPERT LOOK-ALIKE CONTEST" - 7:30 p.m., Sherm's Thunderbird Market on Stewart Parkway, Roseburg. Local politicians and business leaders will determine who most looks like Rupert on the television show, "Survivor." The winner and a guest will earn a seat at a tribal table for a Winston fund-raising event Nov. 13, which will feature a seafood dinner and visits by "Survivor" celebrities. The look-alike contest is being sponsored by KRNR. 673-5553." That's Wednesday, July 7th. Mark your calendars. I know I'm going.
