Handhelds = Nintendo right now, and that's the way it's gonna be until Sony comes out with their PSP handheld. Which then, it will probably be Handhelds = Nintendo and Sony. But Nokia? What crap... honestly, did they actually think they could just barge into the gaming industry and be successful? So anyways, it's a good thing it's only like 100 bucks now, cause now, I still won't buy it. As I said before and yet, I will say it again, N-Gage is for losers.
