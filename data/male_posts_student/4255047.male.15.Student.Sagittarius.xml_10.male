Eh tis not finished    Macbeths’ journey through the self destructive trail of death and murder in order to succeed and achieve power is driven by the sole ambition that Macbeth, is exhumed unto due to the prospect of the highest position of the land, the position of king. However to achieve this God appointed position Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth (who is driven more so by her ambition.) have to hide their true ambitions in order to deceive the rest of the aristocracy that they are truly legitimate and represent the innocent. Macbeth retains his guilt and self afflicted suffering after all the murders he has committed. He masks this hindrance in order to look to the rest of the royal family as if nothing is wrong. The masking which is evident throughout the play is necessary for the couples plan for the assent to the throne and this deception is evident throughout their trail of destruction. All through Act 3 Scene 4 Macbeth and Lady Macbeth both mask their real intentions while hosting a royal party; however Macbeth upon seeing the ghost of Banquo slips with the on going charade, by protesting his innocence “Thou canst not say I did it: never shake    Thy gory locks at me   ” on the murder of his best friend giving the attendants of the party suspicion towards him. Lady Macbeth hides Macbeths’ splurge of guilt trying to keep the crimes under rap, exemplifying the masking of reality and its importance that is exhibited throughout the play and how, many other characters in the play use this to get their agenda fulfilled without a major hindrance. Masking appearances and secret inhibitions are not only displayed by Macbeth and Lady Macbeth but by many of the other characters who have suspicions about Macbeth and the murders, but hide it in order to survive, as questioning the king would amount to treason. For example Macduff hides his reason for leaving his family in order to recruit an army to save them and Scotland from the tyranny of Macbeth. His family tells Macbeth that he is a deserter which sadly but conveniently helps Macduff gather the troops without disruption. Another perspective of the play is in the focus on crime, on how in the end if you have committed something sinister or evil it will always catch up to you and you will be served equal or creator in return. Throughout the play Macbeth becomes a killing machine in order to keep his throne and allow it to stay in the blood line. However, karma catches up to him   , “It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood   .” confesses Macbeth knowing his own fate, in which in the final act he is invaded by the right hearted Macduff and slain in his own castle. So to with Lady Macbeth the guilt and self inflicted pain of the murders becomes too much for her, it fronts up and engulfs her mind resulting in suicide. Again in Act 3 Scene 4 the murder of Banquo comes back to haunt Macbeth during the royal banquet. Macbeth who is already a neurotic mess due to previous murders and now Fleance escaping the ghostly apparition of Banquo pushes him over the edge as his own doings catch up to him, he then lets out a splurge of homicidal denial. Signifying the key moment in the play when the tides of his life begin to change, his rise to power becomes a decent into madness and deterioration. The Marxist reading agues that the play Macbeth is a prime example of how the ideological capitalism of today is a system that will always amount in someone wanting power creating struggles, violence and conflict resulting in evil. By rattling the cage of the stability that society has, as Macbeth did, it amounts in violence and evil exhibited in and throughout the play Macbeth. If the Marxist thinking was applied to the way of life, the case of Macbeth’s tyranny would not have happened and the destruction caused would have been non existent. With all people living as equal pursuit for a throne or fights over power cannot exist and the example of Macbeth wouldn’t have occured. Having little amounts of people at the top of the hierarchy is agued by the Marxist reading to have negative effects on society as a whole. In the case of Macbeth with little numbers of people at the top of the pyramid they keep the poorer people effectively “in their place”. With little amounts people in command making serious decisions mistakes can be made which greatly affects the poor people like with Macbeths tyrannical rule over the people and Scotland. Macbeth is a prime example of a tragic hero with so many great qualities but has an incredibly strong ambition which is his Achilles heal bringing him down and becoming a self consuming tyrant that stops only at death.
