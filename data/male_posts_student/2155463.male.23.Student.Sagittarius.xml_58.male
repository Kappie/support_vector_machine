What if one of the places I have to investigate is a strip club or something like that? (for anyone wondering, NO, I'm NOT hoping that that happens :P).  I mean, I still get a little nervous walking into a bar...what am I getting myself into?  Oh well...suppose it's time to start doin what I think is right and let things take care of themself.  Worst case scenario, I'm makin lemonade...
