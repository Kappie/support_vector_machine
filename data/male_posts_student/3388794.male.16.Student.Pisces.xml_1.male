(you know who you are people).    she fixes her lips, they always look perfect... she wonders what i'll wear   she is, she is. and finally to end on something by me.   cherry red lips, that walk on by, and in my confession, i will say i loved them like the way they move, the way they talk to try, this girl will stay written about in my diary with cherry red lips that walk on by.  candy apples and chocolate remind me of you
