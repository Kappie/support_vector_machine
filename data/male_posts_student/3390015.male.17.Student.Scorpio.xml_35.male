Anyways, if anyone wants to follow these directions, and I STRONGLY suggest you do, here they are:  Plan B  1. Go to www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/theoffice/ 2. Click on the "clips" on the left 3. Scroll down, click on "David Brent: Renaissance Man" 4. Click on "dancer" 5. Enjoy dry humor  This is dry British humor at its best!  Fawlty Towers wasn't bad either...for a British show.  Hmm...been looking at some poetry for help with my new script...and this came to mind, one of my favorite poems, probably one of the best ever written:      Hmmm...there's something suspect about this photo...;)   The Road Not Taken     by Robert Frost   Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.  *End*  On a side note...this is what some "clever" testmakes think tests kids on their intelligence...I say...give me a break:  If all Zips are Zoodles, and all Zoodles are Zonkers, then all Zips are definitely Zonkers.  True or False  Well?!
