    
       I'm back, finally.  It's good to be home again.  My room is already a mess.  So far I've talked to Jason Sullivan, Melody, and Loren, respectively.  Today I went to get my certificate for climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro, together with three pictures from it, framed.  I also got a haircut; so long Jewfro.  TV is freaky now that we have cable.  Then there's the matter of my birthday stuffs.  According to sources, both Melody and Stephanie are going to come (each assuming the other will come) to the first, local thing, which is somewhat surprising.  Then there's also Loren, John, Richie, and possibly Matt K-K and Craig, not to mention ol' Paul Woolfowitz.  I heard Jason thinks he's invited... hmmm...  Anyway, potential movies include "The Door in the Floor" at the West Newton, "The Hunting of the President" at the Embassy, "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" and "Spider-Man 2" at the Circle, and "I, Robot" and "The Notebook" at the Fresh Pond.  The first two can be walked to, though the former is rated "R."  Let me know which you prefer.  Then there's the Rockport thing, or as Melody refers to it, the "homoerotic weekend."  I can only invite three people because of car stuff; I'm thinking Loren, Richie and John.  Richie... haven't seen him for a while.  So in any case, I hope to talk to the rest of you soon.  I'll put the rap that I wrote on the last day of the trip below (Christine was the World Challenge-employed leader, by the way), with the swears edited out and the words meant to be read fast connected by hyphens:   Tanzania: Props and S***   By Alexander Dietz  This all started a year-and-a-half-ago With thirteen kids, Brazinsky and Jobe. World Challenge had come to our door; We didn't know what we were in for.  They said we should-go-to Africa, see the lions and ducks, But first pay them fifty-two hundred bucks. Fine, I said, I'm in; I admit College may have helped a little bit.   Chorus   [ Christine can go f*** herself. I hope that b**** goes to hell. She stole all our hard-earned Gs. Now she'd better get diseased.  Wilson was the biggest c***. He's done way worse than call-me a runt. Tanzania wasn't bad, But to be home I will be glad. ]   Before I knew-it, I wanted to give-them-a beating. Bake sales, car-washes, and four-hour meetings. It was not exactly my idea of fun, But I wanted to do it, just like everyone.  We had a few training missions, those were alright, Though Bear Mountain was not an incredible sight. On the second one we met our leader Christine. She was a businesswoman, didn't seem too mean.   [Chorus]   We were finally ready to fly away From the Boys  Girls Club, and the U.S.A. In Dar es Salaam, the boys got screwed With the bed situation, but what else is new?  After Moshi, we drove to Kimbushi, Got converted by Emmanuel, and wooed by Dominic. Later we visited the Maasai, And on Mt. Longido, Bailey almost died, But that's alright (alride), she survived. And on safari I sucked as leader big time. It was because I really didn't care Since some-o'-these d***s and h**s are annoying, I swear.   [Chorus]   We climbed Kilimanjaro, that took a week. After so much dirt, I wasn't looking too chic. It was a major challenge, I'll give you that, And at the top, Charlie wasn't doing too phat.  But now we've done it, and come to R, Chillin' on the beach in Zanzibar. Was it worth it?  Yeah, I'd say so, Even if our leader has got to go.   [Chorus]
