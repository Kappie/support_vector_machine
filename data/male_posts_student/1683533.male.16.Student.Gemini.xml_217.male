NOFX  was ok on Conan O'Brien.  I was right though.  They played Franco-Unamerican.  When Conan first came out you could see NOFX's equipment set up, and there was a huge pic of George Bush as a clown draped over the keyboard (keyboard is used in that song).  So, it was funny to see that as Conan did his monologue.  Conan is by far my favorite late night host.  He is so goofy and funny.  But NOFX played at the end, and supported their newest album even though its a year old now:  War On Errorism.   They didnt support the new Rock Against Bush compilation which came out that day at all.  Fat Mike of course was sporting his "Not My President" shirt.  Melvin and Hefe and the keyboardist had a shirt that had a stop sign but instead of "stop" it had "bush", the keyboardist had an extra small one exposing his stomach which was pretty funny, and when he played he twisted his head about like he was doing the robot.  They switched the words around in the song, for a more anti-bush sentiment, and Fat Mike was probably drunk because by the end he was trying to sing without laughing.  Yea, they were decent, it was kinda funny though...  I need sleep night night.
