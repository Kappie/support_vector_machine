I hadn't heard much of him either until I saw him yesterday on Meet the Press, which was broadcasting live from the Fleet Center in Boston. "Hey," I wondered, "what's that guy from the Matrix sequels doing on Tim Russert? You know, the stormy, resolute guy who pretended not to be going out with Jada Pinkett?" But then I thought to myself, "That's nuts. Tim Russert doesn't have actors on his show. This isn't Charlie Rose. His questions are too relevant and well-researched." So then I put on my logical deduction hat and started summing twos. It's not hard to draw conclusions about a strapping young negro gentleman in a basketball stadium, is it? Was this a confused Celtic, unaware that his home stadium had been recommissioned for promotional use by the party of his people? And also labor? (Arguably?)    No, unmuting revealed that the guest was the aforementioned Barack Obama, 42-year old Senate hopeful from Illinois and keynote speaker of this week's Democratic National Convention in Boston. Barack Obama is young, well-spoken, and black. More importantly for the Democrats, "Barack Obama" sounds like the name of an intrepid Rebel commander from Star Wars. And, as William Bowers once mused, "Which side was governed by wrinkly hypocritical white men who practiced a bastardized form of a religion and who loved uniforms and marching? Which side policed the world with huge cruisers and weapons that could destroy whole civilizations? Which side was an oppressive monoculture? ...Which side teamed with rogue mercenaries and chubby businessmen to achieve its ends? Which side suffered huge losses when two genital-reminiscent headquarters of its activity were destroyed?" Bowers has a point, but I'm not sure what it is or how it supports mine.    While I'm on the subject of Star Wars, last night I rediscovered Gustav Holst's "Mars, The Bringer of War." Man alive, what a tune. Me and my friend Rick, who played the baritone in middle school band, used to play it real loud all the time before the band instructor would walk in. I would do the "Waaaaah,  wah   waaaaaah " part on the trumpet and he would cover the " Bum  ba-ba-ba- bum bum " part. It was awesome at the time, but neither of us had girlfriends until well into high school. Actually, to the best of my knowledge, Rick still hasn't had a girlfriend. Make what you will of that, but I'm not going to be the first to pin the blame on Holst. Not most of the blame, at least; that would be wrong. Anyway, since between the last time I had heard it and last night file sharing had been invented, I decided to branch out and look up some of Holst's other compositions from the "Planets" suite, and boy am I disappointed. I expected "Jupiter" to bring the timpani if you know what I mean, and sound basically like a fat man running or falling or something like that. Instead I got "Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity." What is that? I mean, what is that? And you know what? It doesn't even sound jovial! It just sounds like outtakes from the recording of the "Titanic" soundtrack, recorded during the session in which they couldn't get the synthesizer voices to work. And "Mercury, The Winged Messenger?" That just sounded like the soundtrack to a couple of Jedi going on some kind of goofy side-adventure when really they'd rather just be getting off the damn planet and getting along with their mission.    Kind of like Barack Obama, his keynote speech at the DNC, and his ongoing Senate campaign in Illinois. If you're not too strict with the logic of your metaphors. In any case, don't fall into the trap of thinking that Commander Obama's name is the only important thing about him. Because, as his colleague Admiral Ackbar would say, "It's a trap."    As it so happens, vibrant, youthful, brilliant Barack Obama is also the Democrats' best chance at capturing a Senate seat in this year's elections. Obama, who has been running a highly competitive campaign ever since his landslide victory in the Illinois primaries, found himself on the right side of an orgy (as if there were a wrong side!) when his competitor, Republican Jack Ryan, was forced to drop out of the race in shame. In shame.    As was revealed in court documents unsealed late last month, Ryan's ex-wife Jeri (Seven of Nine from TV's "Boston Public") had complained when filing for divorce that her eminent husband often coerced her into attending "sex clubs" and tried to convince her to participate in acts of public and group sex. When Jeri Ryan's allegations became public, Jack Ryan withdrew from contention for retiring Republican senator Peter Fitzgerald's seat and  urlLink ended his campaign .    With his opponent from the Party of Family Values out of the way, Harvard-educated civil rights lawyer Barack Obama was suddenly free to pursue his liberal agenda of terrorist sex and gay abortions virtually free of opposition. This rising star and his sure-shot campaign attracted the attention of the Democratic National Committee during their search for a convention keynote speaker. To many, Barack Obama was a natural choice. (Jeri Ryan was not available.) Now, on the eve of the biggest speech of his political career, Barack Obama has emerged as one of the most powerful players in one of the nation's least powerful parties.    Democrats and the  urlLink liberal media  are quick to point out that Obama's rise to success could be a significant turning point not only in the future of the Democratic party, but also in the grand scheme of the American democracy. (And I do mean "grand scheme" in every sense of the phrase.)    If Barack Obama wins his race this November, the midwestern mulatto will be the only African American in the Senate. This shocking fact brings with it many tough questions about the nature of racial advancement in the U.S. government. Why has it taken so long for African Americans to make headway in the Senate? Why don't African American voters organize to combat this problem in districts in which they hold a statistical advantage? Why is the racial composition of the nation's most powerful deliberative body so wildly out of proportion in comparison to any racial breakdown of the American populace? I mean, it's not as if there's a "No Coloreds" sign on the door of the Senate! (The sign actually reads "No blacks.")    In the end, whether the Force is or is not with young Barack Obama in Boston this week not my place to say. But I do know one thing for sure: I should totally call up Rick.
