You see, the grades are posted on Excel, and for some reason my computers at home do not possess this marvelous program.  I did end up going to sleep last night, in case anyone was concerned, I believe I drifted off around 7:30 or so.  I felt great all day today as well.  Had an awesome workout with Shawn, drank a Pepsi, ate some fish for dinner, it was a good day.  Today trainer-Shawn decided he would once again "up my weights" so as to kill me in the arm-region of my body.  Thanks Shawn.  I'm looking at some fat chick's computer screen right now and she's in the process of viewing handbags on E-bay.  I kinda feel like telling her that she should check into discounts on Trimspa instead, because a pink handbag isn't gonna do much in the fashion world if it's being carried by a blarg-party-hat.  (for the definition of blarg, party-hat, and a general understanding of these words' meanings please visit www.fatchicksinpartyhats.com).  I have so many negative things to share!  I think I'll go up to the Great Reading Room of the library and see if my friend is studying there like he always is.  I like to harass people.  2nd post in like 20 days, did you really expect much?
