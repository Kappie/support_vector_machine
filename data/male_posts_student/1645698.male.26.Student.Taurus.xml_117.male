It's from this book I'm reading called  The Year of the French , by Thomas Flanagan.  He's hailed as wonderful, but all I can see is a reasonably good writer who has a slight obsession with the moon.  I suppose I have a bit of the obsession myself. . . perhaps it denotes some measure of Irish blood.  I think it's funny how much we worry about things that don't matter - summer jobs, standardized tests, how often I'm going to get lost on the train ^_^, that we forget about everything else.  I don't know - I suppose I'm thoughtful right now.  I lost a kitten this morning that I was trying to save - it was gray striped with one white paw and hungry.  It played with the tires of the car it was hiding under, but scratched me and ran away when I tried to catch it. Maybe it had eaten cheese, hmm Dollface? ^_~  So moving in with my little brother!  Uh, when he gets a house.  And did you know, everything goes better with rock?  Even if I am littering the internet. ^_^
