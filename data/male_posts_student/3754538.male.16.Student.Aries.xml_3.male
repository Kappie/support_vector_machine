People who won't ever keep their mouths shut even when its the obviously socially polite thing to do. People who offer their support and offer to side with you only to change faces and drop you the moment someone else they like better comes along. A little common courtesy and decency doesn't take much. Which brings me to what people do that really pisses me off. When someone simply won't leave someone else alone. Those people who are somehow offended by ever action and the general existence of the other person and persist in showing this whenver they can. They'll bring up their hatred of the person in jokes, in websites they make, in casual conversations. They'll even start to shun the friends of the person. Why? No better reason then their own immaturities. Often times everyone they known will get tired of hearing about the fact that they hate the one person. This doesn't stop them either, they often will treat it as a minor obsession. They can't just shut the fuck up and go on with life. If you're someone like the aforementioned, do everyone a favor and come up with something new to waste your time on or kill yourself. Have a nice day.
