She’s mad at me and well I let her be for a couple of days I don’t think she wants me as her friend, I called her earlier today she said she’ll call me back so I’m not planning to call her back and I think she won’t call back. Jessica and my cousin Michael (garbagefanscus.com) are talking and I think he likes her. I mean not in love with her but I just fell badly because I don’t want him to waste his time on her because she’s not worth his time. It’s hard to explain but it won’t work. (Or so I think). On much better news, I told Tarah I like her. (Crappy though since she lives in Canada) but I don’t know if she likes me back. Oh one more thing for people who read my Blogger feel free to send me email too but just label something like “After I read your Blogger I started to hate the color tea green autumn” something that let’s me know that you’re a reader. Which just to let you know there’s not a lot of you’s (yes improper grammar) but hey I want to know what you think. Give me advice. I like any feedback. O.K next order of business, I’m playing Dark Cloud 2 again. It’s not too bad but let me tell you I really wasted my money on Megaman anniversary collection. Please save yourself and DO NOT I repeat DO NOT get Megaman anniversary collection It was a waste of money.              I had the funniest dream last night. Jessica went to my house and she hated my room and I laughed. (yeah laughed) and her whole family came over and wanted her, her cousins and me to go to some ice skating place. I told them that I didn’t want to go. I’m not exactly sure what this means but it was kinda weird but hey.              I know I’m jumping from topic to topic but I can’t just can’t wait for UTADA to make her make here in the States. I just love her so much and now in English Utada’s even better then ever. If you want to listen to her music go to  urlLink www.utada.com  but the server sometimes doesn’t work. You can also try her Japanese site  urlLink www.utada.jp  and click on now playing to hear “Easy Breezy” already a hit in Japan. Her original site is  urlLink www.toshiba-emi.com/utada.com  the first two were for her English CD. Her CD comes out October 8 here in USA. I’m so excited but if your desperate like me you can download her first English single on iTunes. Too bad I don’t have iTunes… ((Weep, don’t worry I’m (blow nose) fine)).              I’m trying to get my cousin Alyssa to go to my middle school. I loved it there. Well let’s get some things right. My program I loved, some of the other ones are kinda crazy. Anyway she has to be my protégé there keep good grades and eventually make it to a specialized high school. One of six, anyone really. I just want her to go to a good school cause the schools around her place (zone) is really bad. But um I think she’ll get in.
