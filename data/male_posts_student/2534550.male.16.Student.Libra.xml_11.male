I figured it wouldnt really be appropriate to mix my corps life with the sexally-charged entries of my  urlLink original blog , and so the creation of this corps blog. Entries regarding camps, tour, fees, and other member's thoughts on said topics will be posted, as we all have a crap load to say, and voila, a forum for such.   All comments welcome, and well, wanted.   First  urlLink BDB  camp on Saturday, January 10th.  (Rick Odello says the 2nd weekend in January, I did the dirty work)  Please, we're trying for a 36 member hornline, we seem to be needing to prove to our own organization that we are a legitimate corps, and should be taken as such.   We're hauling ass, recruiting and finding donations, fighting for the life of our corps (which is, YES, safe for 2004) and then Dave Gibbs sends out a letter, asking for money inwhich this line is written:    "Do not be mistaken. The Blue Devils are not in the red. We run a tight ship..."    Despite the redundant cliches, this offers a comforting message to the Blue Devil patron, assuring them that yes, we are ok. Why didnt you mention the fact that you were considering cutting B Corps entirely to keep the Blue in the red? After that of course, C corps would falter and die, seeing how there was no corps for them to feed into. Surely Mr. Gibbs knew this, and yet, the mailing proclaims everything is fine. Everything is not fine. Just so you know.  I've taken my "Save BDB" avatar off of my DCP sn, because, we're ok for now. We're safe for the 2004 season. But BD is NOT running a tight ship, not if they were so seriously considering cutting a long standing cadet corps and endangering another.   just so ya know.
