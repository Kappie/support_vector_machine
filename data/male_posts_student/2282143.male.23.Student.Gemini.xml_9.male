I mean, really, what is the big deal of the matter?  I personally feel that love holds no gender, and if you find someone of the same sex who you truly love, then good for you.  Does this mean the moral downfall of America?  No, and I think you're nuts if you think so.  What is gay marriage going to do besides give them the opportunity to share benefits and profess their love for each other?  Why should this be different than when I get married?  I mean, even if you don't approve of the lifestyle, cant we just be happy for one another?  "I found someone I really connect with, I found some I care about deeply, I found someone I really love"  but that's not ok, just because they happen to be of the same sex.    But what about the Bible?  Doesn't God say Homosexuality is a sin?  I think this quote sums up my feelings nicely:  "Reason has played a major part in religion ever since two Biblical nudists took dietary advice from a talking snake." Jon Stewart-The Daily Show, November 4  Love God, Love Jesus, just don't trust the Church (I mean this more as the largest political/organized crime machine that causes televangelism and narrows your mind).  The Bible was written by the same people who created indulgences, the Spanish Inquisition, the thought that women were property, and the bubonic plague (although I cant scientifically prove that one, Im sure they had something to do with it!!! hahahaha!)  So until I see the 1900 year old scroll written in Greek, Latin, or Aramaic, then I'm only taking the good lessons out of the Bible and saying the rest was just written for control of the masses.  Anyways, enough religion bashing.    Just think.  How does this really affect your life?  Unless your partner decides to run off with someone of the same sex and get married, then it doesn't matter, does it?  And if they do run off, then you've had problems way before that point.  So why not let love prevail and just accept that being gay isn't such a horrible crime.  If you can come up with a valid argument as to why same sex marriage is wrong without referring to God in any way, then  urlLink PLEASE EMAIL ME  and prove me wrong.  Really.  Prove me wrong.  I dare you.    So in the mean time...  Be good to yourself, and one another.
