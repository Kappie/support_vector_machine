The book is called  The New Chinese Astrology  and it is by Suzanne White. I find it sketchy in some bits, but hell, astrology is a lot of bullshit mixed in with some realism.  ___________  Ah Virtuous Rabbit!    You seek harmony. You are careful and practice discretion in all things. When you sense a conflict lurching your way, you skitter off and hide. Distinguished, diplomatic and well-mannered, you are also as nervous as a rabbit. Culture and refinement comfort you. You don’t hate money either: you know instinctively how to earn and keep your fortune without flash or flaunt. You favour traditional antique furnishings over chrome and glass contemporary. You’re a soft-stepping go-getter… Ambitious but never aggressive, strong but never rough. Your brand of wisdom says that ‘He who fights and runs away lives to fight another day.’   You are hypersensitive- squeamish, even. You are a bit of a hypochondriac: an innocent hangnail on your big toe alarms you. ‘Call an ambulance; Get me to the emergency room!’ Chronic illnesses- migraine, asthma, hay fever, lower back pain, warts, hives- you’ve tried them all.  Buy yourself a big house in the country, then fill it with brilliant, well-behaved kids. Choose a partner from gentle Coats, scrupulous Pigs or loyal dogs. If you’re feeling lavish, remember that Snakes are delighted to languish on Rabbits’ velvet divans. Avoid Tigers, Roosters, and Dragons. You plan your life to run smoothly. And usually it does. But should spontaneity enter the picture and events go awry- you freak out. Take my advice and lighten up. Not only on yourself but, more especially, on the rest of us.               Rabbits are discretion incarnate. They live quietly, in refined surroundings, prefer to ask very little of others and are not keen on entertaining just any old company. Rabbits observe the world from their place on hearth, meticulously scrutinising their own and others’ behaviour. No matter how successful or socially respectable they are, Rabbits often feel unsure of themselves, worrying about the impression they make, wondering if their gestures and actions are acceptable and decorous enough to pass muster with higher-ups.  Although he always claims to be ready to learn new things, the Rabbit is not a willing traveller or changer of address. Ideally, he lives in a harmonious relationship in a lovely home with close friends and family nearby. Despite his native curiosity and dreams of touring exotic lands, home is still the best place for a Rabbit. He feels safe and secure, comfortable and cosy in his own home and would prefer never to spend so much as a night elsewhere.   Nothing gets under the Cat’s sensitive skin more irritatingly than disorder. He is fastidious about structure. He hates chaos, deplores anarchy and refuses to have anything to do with liberalism. Although he might claim to adhere to the principles and espouse some of its more humane aspects, the sternly traditional Rabbit does see any better way to run the world than to maintain a rigid social structure- even at the cost of justice and, if necessary, under the yoke of tyranny.  Therefore, he possesses an odd combination of conflicted characteristics. He sincerely believes in justice, yet, he is mostly unwilling to stick out his delicate neck to make certain that it gets done. He will speak at length about his pet theories and share his rigid opinions on many issues, but when it comes to defending them, debating openly, or standing up for issues he claims to hold dear, the Rabbit disappears.   Rabbits cling to old-fashioned tenets and are virtually cemented in their ways. They feel that dissension should be kept out of life altogether, preferring to ignore discord and pretend that violence never existed. Rabbits like books that don’t upset or frighten them, rigorously avoid seeing disturbing movies or TV shows and steer a wide berth around truth-revealing confrontations.  The Rabbit constantly seeks protection from reality. You will rarely find one of these vulnerable creatures beating a path to the scene of an accident. Rabbits are afraid of their own shadows and do not want to live in or deal with tumult or upheaval. They also hate tardiness and have no patience with procrastination. For the Rabbit, all aspects of life should be clear-cut, well thought-out, on schedule and up front. If Rabbits had their way, all human beings would be preordained, by birth, social status, and degree of civilisation to fit neatly into ‘life slots’, do their respective jobs well, marry, procreate, die and get buried in the local churchyard.   Messiness and confusion are the Rabbit’s worst enemies but should he encounter either, the Rabbit rolls up his sleeves and dives in to put it to rights. Rabbits will take charge of de-mildewising your fridge, untangling three hundred feet of garden hose or clearing weeds out of a vegetable patch in a trice. Rabbits so dislike anything they feel is opposed to the natural order that they often jump self-righteously at the chance to make order out of chaos. Some call it meddling.          ___________  And since I’m a fire rabbit, I decided to write up what she put for fire rabbits xD Apparently Harry Belafonte and Fidel Castro are fire rabbits. Amazing innit. ___________  Fire often brings instability to the staid Rabbit yet also adds verve to his prissy, over-correct nature. He cannot be called aggressive, but the Fire Rabbit is generally somewhat feistier than his fellow rabbits.   Genius thrives in this Rabbit. Many great writers and musicians, painters and poets were born in Fire Rabbit years. Emotionally intuitive, he can pick up extra-sensory messages in others and frequently knows how to transform them into poignant works of art. This Rabbit will also have an incisive sense of humour and knows how to charm people with it. Others usually enjoy his company and find his wit intelligent and easily applicable to real-life situations. The Fire Rabbit is the least shy of all Rabbits. He can handle fame and deal competently with the public without needing to flee the spotlight.   He is no altruist, however. He is supremely self-centred and wants his way in most relationships. He can be strong in the gave of opposition- if he needs to, he will bare his claws and hiss loudly to warn off attacks- but he would prefer to play a waiting game, using devious tactics to avoid confrontation and skirting most thorny issues. The anguish the Fire Rabbit experiences during a waiting period can cause him serious health problems. He is not naturally well equipped with inner conflict. Yet he creates it by holding his real feelings in while waiting for the moment to strike. If he could learn to be more humane, put his ego in his pocket, acquire a knowledge of how to care for others and exchange his feelings more readily, he could avoid engendering complex chronic health problems such as depression and neuroses later on.  People accuse Fire Rabbits of arrogance. He may at first seem reserved and aloof. Mostly he attempts to present an affable façade but sensitive people are not fooled. He is over-confident and full of himself when it comes to matters of the mind.   The fire Rabbit reads a lot. His memory is vast and its information well organised. In discussion he can be arch and pedantic, causing his friends and family to spend many a yawnful evening hearing him out on subjects of arcane interest to nobody. Others, again, don’t count for much- and their opinions, frankly, bore him.   Government jobs and administrive posts attract and suit the Fire Rabbit. He will be at home in the snobbish, gilded atmospheres of embassies and diplomatic missions around the world. He also makes a wonderful business executive. Not only is he capable of brilliant management, but the Fire Rabbit has a way of infusing his workplace with that special Rabbit flair and elegance and he can spot problems before they can happen. No budget-conscious, caution-loving, self-respecting, hotshot Fire Rabbit would ever allow a small financial deficit to grow into a looming red figure on the bottom line.  ___________  This is more accurate xD And best for last is the bits I find laughable.  ___________  Your Best   Colour is grey Flower is rose Fragrance is Shalimar  Tree is poplar  Flavour is tangy  Musical instrument is piano  Birthstone is sapphire  Lucky number is 4  Your Favourite   Food is fish (HAHAHAHA)  Animal is squirrel (I mentioned one in a bit I wrote two days ago)  Drink is Bordeaux  Spice is pepper (Yes, actually, it is)  Metal is bronze  Herb is tarragon          The Rabbit is Yin  The Rabbit's Motto is: ‘I Retreat’   In pussycat mode, the Rabbit person is sensitive, tactful, home-loving, refined, prudent, discreet, long-living, ambitious, cultured, well-mannered, artistic, considerate, scholarly, suave, graciously hospitable, modest and unimpeachably virtuous.  But rub his fur the wrong way and he becomes snobbish, secretive, pedantic, complicated, haughtily indifferent, self-indulgent, hypochondriacal, punctilious, judgemental, self-righteous, deceptive, self-centred and terminally condescending.  ___________  Errrr, is there a lesson in all this? Yes, if you’re going to buy me fragrances, buy me Shalimar heh
