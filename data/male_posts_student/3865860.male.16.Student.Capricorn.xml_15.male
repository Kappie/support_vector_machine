I love Ben KWellers music it really talks to me and i can empathise with him. ANyway 1/2 way through there are theses two losers dressed up as axel rose and slash and they keep yelling things at BK, BK humours them at first by playing 'sweet child of mine' but then gets quickly pissed off with their abuse. He then procedes to yell at them and get them thrown out, but they ruined the concert for me because BK had to leave early because of a sore throat he got while yelling at them :( APart from that the gig totally ruled i got a t-shirt and a pin, I cant wait to go back to see him in september!!!! I'd Never been to the academy 2 before but now i apprieciate how close you are to the band, i could of touched BK if id wanted to. I enjoyed most of the night but towards the end i started to think of how i didnt have a girlfriend and i so want one. Oh well i guess im destined to be a single. Anyways its kinda late and i have a headache and my legs are tired so im gunna go sleep now (yay!)  Love you all  Tom
