At the present state of our society there will not be a true, scientific and properly functioning form of communism that will be allowed to govern and prosper over a whole nation.      A commonly believed definition of communism is a society ruled by a single party with a monopoly on political power and free speech and suppresses all opposition, and it is an economy controlled by centralized bureaucratic planning.  However, by scientific definition communism is a classless society with no exploitation and no oppression from one from one section of the population to another, no armies or police and no production for profit or exchange.      There has never been a scientific form of communism in our world, and socialism has only existed in infantile form, such as the Paris Commune and Lenin’s Revolution. The ten basic and easy steps to communism are: abolition of property in land (all land is rented from the government) heavy income tax abolition of all rights of inheritance confiscation of all emigrant and rebel’s property centralizing credit to the state by means of a national bank centralizing communication and transportation to the state factories and productions owned by state equal liability of all labor combining agriculture and manufacturing and redistributing the population free public education and no child workhouses       Communism has at one time or another been a popular idea in the many countries where there have been Communist parties at one time or another, including Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia.  Many countries have had a communist party or form of government at one time or another. According to Engels and Marx, “Communist theory can be summed up in a single phrase; abolition of private property.”  Communism can also be said to follow the principle of “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.”   One problem with reinstating communism into our world today after the collapse of the Russian and Chinese Communist Parties is called the Crisis of Theory.   The Crisis of Theory deals with the facts that our modern society is ruled by the bourgeoisie (the rich middle and upper classes), and the level to with which they perpetuate our culture.  The fact that they promote women’s bodies as commodities and belongings, that they are pushing at us insincerity and unquestioning belief from so called “authority figures”, and the spend, spend, spend, spend which is pushed at us through television, radio, magazines and other media outlets.   One question presented when dealing with communism is “Can the system function without capitalists?”  The answer is a resounding yes.  “To say that we could not work without capital is as true as to say that we could not mow without a scythe.  To say that we could not work without a capitalist is as false as to say that we could not mow a meadow unless all the scythes belonged to one man.  Nay it is as false as to say that we could not mow unless all the scythes belonged to one man and he took a third of the harvest as payment for the loan of them.”  This is a quote from Robert Blatchford’s book Merrie England. The question of whether we can function without capitalists has been asked in many different forms throughout our history.  Can we function without slave owners?  Yes!  Can we function without feudal lords?  Yes!  So can we function without capitalists?   However, without the capitalists you would be without the competition that is ingrained in their economical system.  Without this competition most communist nations falter or stay at a technological growth standstill, and fall farther and farther behind capitalist economies and nations.   The most obvious and inevitable problem that leads to the failure of communism is the corruption of leadership and power.  While the whole point of communism is to have working class rule without leaders, communism has created many leaders, and some leaders of communism are corrupted by the leadership and power they wield over the trusting middle class.  This sometimes leads to a conversion of the government from a communist government to a dictatorship. Some notable attempts at socialist and communist revolutions and governments are Lenin’s Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the Paris Commune of 1871.      The Paris Commune was an ill-fated attempt in the history of revolutionary coups attempting to change governments to communism.  When France went to war with Prussia in the early 1870s they lost, but this was something that the Parisians were not willing to accept.  The Parisians and the National Guard took cannons left over from the Siege of Paris and transferred them to working class areas.      When the government sent in troops to retrieve these cannons, they refused to fire on the crowd, and the crowd proceeded to force the national government to withdraw to Versailles.  The crowd continued to occupy and control the city, and many fled.      On March 26th a vote was cast and the Paris Commune was voted in.  The Commune then moved to decrease rents, allow up to a three-year delay on the payment of overdue bills, set up unemployment and allowed trade unions to take over the management of factories.  Much was done during these months to improve women’s working rights.      But on April 2 troops began to attack France, and on May 21 reached Paris.  10,000 to 30,000 Parisians were killed, and public executions were started.  One week later, May 28, the Commune had completely collapsed, and more than 5,000 Parisians were transferred to penal colonies.      One major problem with the Paris Commune was the revolutionary violence that was used to transfer the power of the government.  Revolutionary violence when used in revolutions usually leads to retaliation from the victims, and it did so in this case.  However the implements the new government installed in its brief three-month reign proved that Paris might have been on its way from converting from capitalist to socialist to communist forms on a government.       Lenin’s Bolshevik Revolution led to the creation of the Soviet Union, which lasted until 1991.  One problem with this revolution was the fact that the leader, Lenin, may have been corrupted.      One statement from him to his Commissar of Justice, who had asked him, “What is the point of a People’s Commissar of Justice?...It would be more honest to have a People’s Commissar for the Social Extermination.”  To this he had replied, “Excellent idea!  That’s exactly how I see it.  Unfortunately, it wouldn’t do to call it that.”      This can be interpreted however one wants to it.  But it might not mean what it seems.  One definition of “social”, according to Webster’s New World Edition Third Edition, is “of or relating to upper classes”.  So this statement could be interpreted as meaning that Lenin wanted a Commissar whose only job was to try to exterminate the upper class.      Lenin also has said, in an order to member of the predecessor organization to the KGB, “You must make an example of these people.  Hang (I mean hang publicly, so that people can see it) at least 100 kulaks, rich bastards and known bloodsuckers.”  Again this statement may have been completely blown of proportion, although one can interpret in many ways.      Another problem with communism is the revolutionary violence used to usher in the new government, or the violence that the communist government enacts on its followers.  According to The Black Book of Communism, during the USSR’s regime, there were more than 20,000,000 deaths, and the People’s Republic of China has an astounding 65,000,000 deaths by communist and socialist regimes.  This book estimates that in the 20th century there were between 85 and 100 million deaths by these communist and socialist regimes. Two of America’s biggest enemies of communism were J. Edgar Hoover and Senator Joseph McCarthy.  Were they wrong or right?  Is communism a totalitarian and oppressive form of slavery?  Or is communism the inevitable peaceful abundant and utopian future of mankind?  One thing to keep in mind when reading their statements and books is that the only forms of communism that they had ever seen were corrupted, as all communism is.  No communism has ever followed its scientific definition and been a completely classless society with one class, working, and no oppression. One rather ironic side effect of the 20th century communists is the leaders it has created.  While communism’s main purpose is to abolish leaders, it has influenced and created many, including Stalin, Lenin, Marx and Castro.      All that communism can do in its present state and in our present capitalist society is provide our society with a better alternative viewpoint and a possible alternative society.  It might be that in the future there may be scientifically correct functioning of communism without corrupt political rulers.  But there are the problems of revolutionary violence, power corruption, bloodshed and the Crisis of Theory .                           my props to anyone who made it this far ( i only proofread the whole thing through once, and that was skimming) and i am hoping the punk movement kicks in soon cause i'm getting really tired of the art rock (zeppelin) writing and the 2000 word blogs-anyone agree?
