People in general piss me off. Just the way "these" people are being/are just pisses me off. I mean fucking hell. I wish people respected other peoples taste, opinions, views, music, interests, etc. Fuck people who are like that. I feel so alien sometimes. Theres stuff I do for fun that doesnt entertain people enough and I get "looked down upon" because I'm not interested in the same things as whoever. Fuck that, why cant people just fucking respect shit. I wish the world wasnt so GAY.  I have such complex thoughts. My inner "being" is so much different. I think way too much and analyize shit deeply and way too far. But I like it. It seems like other people I know are so empty. They just exist they dont think about stuff they just do whatever. I dont see how people get along in life without imagination or expression. Stupid people who follow the crowd, PREPS, GOTHS, etc. FUCK im also sick of putting labels on people but its SO DAMN TRUE. I'm a hypocrit mother fuckers LIVE WITH IT.  I fucking NEED my FUCKING MUSIC!  I made the god damn soccer team. Yay? The coach was like "if you're one of the ones who isnt here monday (the ppl who got cut) you're lucky " so we have conditioning for like a week and a half or something. I'm so not looking forward to it, but I'm actually glad to be on the team and if I can get through this next week of SHIT I can do pretty much anything. The only thing that sucks is that the team fucking sucks. So yea fuck.  I'm sick of _____ you pick what I'm sick of because it probably fits.
