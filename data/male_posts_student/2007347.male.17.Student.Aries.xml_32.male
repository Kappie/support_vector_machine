I thought you'd be out of my mind  And I'd finally found a way to  Learn to live without you  I thought it was just a matter of time  Till I had a hundred reasons  Not to think about you  But it's just not so  And after all this time  I still can't let go  I've still got your face  Painted on my heart  Scrawled upon my soul  Etched upon my memory baby  I've got your kiss  Still burning on my lips  The touch of my fingertips  Is love so deep inside of me   I was trying everything that I can  To get my heart to forget you  But it just can't seem to  I guess it's just no use  In every part of me  Is still a part of you   I've still got your face  Painted on my heart  Scrawled upon my soul  Etched upon my memory baby  I've got your kiss  Still burning on my lips  The touch of my fingertips  Is love so deep inside of me   I've still got your face  Painted on my heart  Painted on my heart  Painted on my heart   Something in your eyes keeps haunting me  I'm trying to escape you  And I know there ain't no way to  To chase you from my mind   I've still got your face  Painted on my heart  Scrawled upon my soul  Etched upon my memory baby  I've got your kiss  Still burning on my lips  The touch of my fingertips  Is love so deep inside of me, baby   I've still got your face  I've still got your face  painted on my heart  painted on my heart  painted on my heart
