I could'nt be happier. In WWE, Rikishi was just a overweight joke. All he really did was just dance around, and rub his ass in people's faces. According to various online wrestling news sources, they "released" (Another word for fired) him because he was milking an injury he had recieved not too long ago. While on the injured list, he wrestled at a indy wrestling show (Which was run by his uncle Afa The Wild Samoan). If he had such a bad injury, then why did he fight at that show?     The world of wrestling makes no sense.      Song of the Moment:   Bronski Beat - Hit That Perfect Beat
