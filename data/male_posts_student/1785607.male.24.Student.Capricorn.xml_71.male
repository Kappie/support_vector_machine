You've had a number of career successes in recent years, and you want to keep that impetus going. So you'll be working as hard as ever. Your personal life is likely to be quite fulfilling. Your love life will have its ups and downs, but if you take the time to communicate with your mate, all should be worked out, because there's no lack of love between you. As the year ends, you'll be more than ready for 2005 and its opportunities.    urlLink MSN Astrology
