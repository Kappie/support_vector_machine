It involved an...well no I can't say. It involved the po-po. And Eric walking from the crime scene, and us video taping it, the glory of Jimmy laughing while running from the crime scene. Dan was there too. Ok, that day kicked ass, Christian my across the street neighbor (who we believe has a part of his brain missing) tried to attack us with bats and lacrosse sticks but we shoved bowling balls up their asses...what? OK. Anyways. this vacation is kicking ass, band practice is fun. We're trying to make a long story song but it's not working out too well but it was good anyways. Last night I went to the mall with Heaton to buy Revolutions on DVD but mainly to meet Keith and Steve at Friday's where they told the waitress it was my birthday and they brought out the apple crisp on me. It was dandy. We slept in a tent at Keith's, I froze my ass off. The next day we helped transport their secret fort up in the woods with Matt Butera aka mole. Then I left, the rest of the day just drummed my ass off. From like 3 to 8:30. Yea. I'm insane. Insanely stupid that is. Then I watched part of Sandlot and Old School with papa. Now I'm tired and I'm going to bed.
