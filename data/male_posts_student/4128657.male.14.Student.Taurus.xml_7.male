I find when I buy berries at the farmer's market they are very ripe, so I have to use them in a day or two.  I made this recipe last summer a few times and it was delicious. I made 18 muffins from this recipe and I baked them for only 22 minutes.  So what exactly is an olallieberry? It’s a loganberry crossed with a youngberry, or what we know as a blackberry crossed with a European raspberry. It’s deep purple in color and tartly delicious in taste, perfect for pies and jams.  http://www.sbceo.k12.ca.us/~uccesb1/smfnws10.htm    Banana Raspberry Muffins  I found this recipe at www.chocolatesnowball.com/muffins.html   Slightly redolent of banana, these moist, berry-full treats are wonderful for Sunday brunch.  Blackberries or blueberries can replace the raspberries in this recipe.  2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour   2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder   1/2 teaspoon baking soda   1/2 teaspoon salt   8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted (I used margarine)  2/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar   3 eggs   3 ripe bananas, mashed (I used 2 1/2 )  2/3 cup whole milk   1 teaspoon vanilla extract   1 1/2 cups raspberries, fresh or frozen (I used a mix of the berries I found at the farmer's market)  1/4 cup Butter Streusel (see fundamentals) (I didn't add this)  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Line 12 muffin cups with paper cupcake liners, or coat the muffin tins with melted butter and dust with flour, or spray generously with cooking spray.  To make sure muffins release with ease, coat the top of the pan as well as the inside of the cups when you grease the tins.  Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set aside.  Whisk the butter and brown sugar in a large bowl, and then whisk the eggs.  Add the bananas, mil and vanilla.  Add the dry ingredients all at once, stirring just until blended.  Quickly fold in the berries.  Divide into prepared muffin cups and sprinkle with Butter Streusel.  Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until the tops of the muffins are golden brown and they spring back when touched with a finger.  Cool for about 5 minutes, then remove from the pan.  Makes 12 muffins.  High altitude: Reduce baking powder to 1 3/4 teaspoons.
