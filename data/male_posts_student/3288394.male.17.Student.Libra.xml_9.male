So first it says there's a BIIIIIG problem and I'd better reinstall. So I do that and it's all happy. Then when I try to do the cool stuff, it says I need a valid root logging directory or summat. I'm all like, what the drugs is this junk on? It doesn't let me hit Apply or OK. Long story short, I find the uninstall and quick. My friends, I don't like Middle Man.
