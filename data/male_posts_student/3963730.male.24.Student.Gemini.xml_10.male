I left a voice message on Odile's french mobile on Thursday, to tell her my uni results. I feel like itwas somehow a joint effort, since I am sure that it was  being with her that  made the difference for my improvement at uni last year . Although this yearwas myachievement, but it was definitelyrooted a lot inmy year with Odile.  This year I have to thank my classmates  for the joint effort, I loved every moment of thisuni year - more than any other (at uni), and to feel so many people as friends motivatedme hugely at uni, and in life .        Today I recieved twotextos from her, just moments after I had been thinking about her andimagining thatI was unlikely to get a reply. She didn't mention my results, so I guess she hadn't heard that message yet, and was replying to a texto I sent a week earlier about getting in touch by SMS. But she gave me her swiss mobile number, so I hope we can speak often by texto now.         I am so happy to hear from her , and can't wait to speak with her (tomorrow I hope). I have really missed her, and would love us to not be so distant anymore.        Today was definitely an enjoyable day for me :)
