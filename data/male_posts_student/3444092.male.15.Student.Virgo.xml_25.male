On Saturday, Im going swimming with Kristina, Lexie, and possibly aaron, so that should be fun. And the day after that, Im goin to that APC show, so yeah. I really need to get my lazy ass over to UOP to see when summer polo starts. The last thing I need is to get out of shape this summer( I' already out of shape, but more out of shape then I am now)  I have been playing  Knight of the Old Republic  lately. I like it because of the fact that you can decide whether you're evil or not. Its a star wars game, which makes me feel really nerdy(everytime I play the game, I can't help but think of the one time I was in Barnes and Noble, and saw the flier for people who really wanted to 'live' in the Star Wars universe) but besides from that, I really like the game.
