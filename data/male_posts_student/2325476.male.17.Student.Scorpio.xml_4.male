Sigh, being back in charlottes cool, but i wish that the people i cared about from VA were here...  "Err ehn uh bla, chuka fooky fun fla, chuka flabel-blably, fladel-bladel, a beee-uh eedle-uhm flanh, chuka flun-blanh blanh Blanh BLAHN, flagun-blabum, fog-a-moo a momma Lucifer!   And the peculiar thing is this my friends, the song we played on that fateful night didn't actually sound anything like this song!  This is just a tribute!!"  So yea, have a good day ppls, i'm gonna go try to find something to occupy my time now that i've finished transcribing that acapella thing(if you listen to it, it's pretty accurate).
