I'll redo most of it now:  First off, I'd like to welcome my good friend Flippin Pirate to The Off-White House. He's a refugee from Xanga, make him welcome if you would. I've posted our Xbox Live! GamerTags off to the right. Look us up and play a few rounds of something with us.  I've been pretty quiet recently. This is almost completely because I figure people don't want to hear me bitch about my job. The other part is I haven't been doing anything interesting lately. And, well, I'm lazy.  What I've been doing:    Playing a whole lot of the  urlLink Battlefield Pirates Mod . It's a ton of fun in the sun. I demand you download it now.  Working, which I may or may not get fired from. Isn't that a kick in the ass?  Playing Black Arrow for the magnificent Xbox. I feel marginally ripped off, but it's good fun.  Launching little Estes model rockets. Details below.   After reading a bunch of  urlLink Armadillo Aerospace 's news updates, I got the feeling to dust off my only remaining (so I thought) working rocket.   Armadillo's going for the  urlLink X-Prize  that you've heard so much about. The news probably included Burt Rutan's  urlLink Scaled Composites , but Armadillo may give them a run for their money. Plus,  urlLink John Carmack  runs the operation.  So, indulging this urge, Wingman and I headed on on Thursday and Friday evenings to launch our rockets. (1 each) Mine alternated between good and totally balls ass crazy flights. Tom's did great the first night. But on the second night, the parachute/streamer ejection charge failed and it plummeted down into some cow pens. We weren't able to recover it. May it rest in peace.  Earlier this evening, Pirate and I headed out again and launched two of mine. (I found one.) We launched this little red and black Mars lander affair and it was a perfect flight, except the parachute got a little melty and didn't open. It was alright though. The white one flew about 500 feet into the air, and came down a quarter mile away. We found it in somebody's backyard garden. When we launched the Mars lander again, the ejection charge failed. It almost hit us on the way down When we got to the wreckage, it was OK except for the fact that one leg had flown off, and another was broken, but inside the lander still. Damn, damn, damn. Two out of 3 is enough to make me swear off  urlLink Wal-Mart 's mini engines for good. I'll buy a pack of normal size tomorrow, and then I'd like to transition to  urlLink eHobbies  for all my rocketry needs.  Just before I began typing the ill-fated blog post, I finished a dual chute system for the white rocket. I tested it outside by spinning around and pulling the nose cone off, and it works well. Hopefully we can field test it tomorrow.  I'll post the pics we took tonight tomorrow, because Pirate can't upload his pictures to his computer.  TopGun out.
