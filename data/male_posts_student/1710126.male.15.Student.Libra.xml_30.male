He filled up the water He laid out the dry rags He set up the easel He painted.  He painted his face, ears lips nose and the windows of his soul. A masterpiece.  he painted his hair, brown black gold and the curtains of his soul. A masterpiece.  Stepped back, admired, Sigh of contentment. But wait, something's wrong, Creased brow.  He missed out the faults, Pimples, scars And the blackness of his soul. A blemish.  He filled in the acne He painted the freckles He drew in the uglies Stepped back.  Lo behold.  A masterpiece.  "It is a part of me."
