There's a thread about yesterday's Hall of Fame election of Gary Carter and Eddie Murray, and someone posted a quote from Eddie Murray:  He had just gotten glasses, fairly late in his career, and someone asked him if he'd noticed anything different since he began wearing them, and he said something like, "I noticed there's a lot of ugly people in the stands."  That's pretty funny.  And in case you're looking for a couple more websites to make you less productive:  urlLink Television Without Pity  and  urlLink TV Tattle  -- recaps and forums about TV shows at the first, news about TV at the second.
