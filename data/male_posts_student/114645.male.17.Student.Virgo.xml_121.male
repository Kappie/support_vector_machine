List five things you'd like to accomplish by the end of the year. Get ESU off the ground, build more on the Teensters house, take more to Trystin, get to know Scott better, and drive on the freeway more 2. List five people you've lost contact with that you'd like to hear from again. Um, I dunno. Maybe Josh and Justin from Arizona. 3. List five things you'd like to learn how to do. Oh, there are to many. I dunno. 4. List five things you'd do if you won the lottery (no limit). Buy a Mazda RX-8, Lincoln LS, a house in Summerlin, a new Toshiba laptop, the $3000 ones, and buy a plane, maybe a Cessna Citation or something. 5. List five things you do that help you relax. get online, chat with friends, listen to celtic music, sit in my room, light candles.
