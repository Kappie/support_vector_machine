There was a letter one the table delivered by courier mail with my name on it...turned out to be my passport! Nothing is stopping me from going onto the Excelsior now! Gonna be a great week.  Went out and bought myself a headset for voice communication...no I want to find some voice recognition software to play around with..lol. I also got a cashbox while I was there..sicne the plastic thing I have for documents and money isn't very secure, metal cashboxes much better.  Spend ages looking around all the computer shops, electronics stores, and office places looking for this stuff...nothing anywhere! After searching for almost an hour I gave up and went to Argos, and got some good ones from there. So now I am wearing the headset and getting used to it, although it took me some time to find the microphone plug in the back of the computer, seeing as I can't see round the back and theres a massive web of cables there. Always the simple things that turn out hard.   Had a look in the computer game shops while I was in the city centre, Thief: Deadly Shadows is for sale in some for about Â£30, but I already got that, the one I am looking for is Thief Gold, which is the only Thief I havn't got yet. I am determined to find it though...lol...I been searching for Carnivores as well, but since thats not sold here in the UK, I have given up hopes of buying it anywhere apart from the internet.  Well, thats life I guess..no point complaining about it, some friends of mine are getting it for me.  Now I sit here typing, and plan on going out soon again, get some information and contacts for the Excelsior trip since I now have to give them my passport number, I couldn't put that on the form when I sent that to them since I didn't have the passport then. Apparently I may be able to reclaim the passport fee from the City Youth Service...so thats more good news.  Apart from that, not much else has happened. I successfully completed Lands Of Lore 3 again, this time deliberately making it harder for myself as I always do when I have completed a game.  Once I get back later, I may have more to add here. But for now, nothing more to report.
