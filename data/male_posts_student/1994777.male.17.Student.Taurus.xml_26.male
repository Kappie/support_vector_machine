Macy failed seven times before his store in New York caught on english novelist John Creasey got 753 rejection slip  before he published 564 books Babe Ruth struck out 1330 times but he also hit 714 home runs don't worry about failure worry about the chances you miss when you dont even try.  this message was given to me by national swimmer chan u-nice just a while ago.and it really was comforting.i guess this failure was just a stepping stone for greater things to come.i've had worst things happen in my life than missing out on this record.its hard to pick myself up from such a fall.but i have to.even if it cost me my pride.to know that so many of my team mates and friends still believe that i could make it really cheered me up a whole lot.yes im disappointed but i'll take this as a lesson in life.a valuable one.to constanly remind me that i will be beaten some day if i dont strive to stay at the top.and if i give up that easily.then i'll never be a true champion in anyone's eyes.  nat i'm sorry you had to put up with all my tantrums these past weeks.after much thought.i realised that it really doesnt matter if i broke the record or had a shitty swim.cos i know i'll swim better the next time.what really matters is that i have you and knowing that you were always there for me is all that i'll ever need.swimming might be important to me.but as i looks at things in a different perspective.ive realised that my life wouldn't be as complete as it is right now if it hadnt been for you who stood by me these months.youre the reason i carry on when everything seems to fall apart cos i know that i can find comfort strength and the will to overcome life's greatest challenges as long as i have you by my side.i'm really lucky that youve become part of my life and believe me when i say that i love you cos it comes from the bottom of my heart.  to all my swim mates at the COE.thanks alot guys for making the past few months of training so enjoyable.you guys are really one hell of a team and i hope that this team spirit of yours would carry on.cong.youre the man now in the coe.please guide the guys to greater heights in their swimming carree when me bing and unice are no longer there to help out.i'm truly happy for you for breaking the record and will be back soon enough to start racing the 15hundered again ya?haha.lets try and push the record to greater heights and take singapore's distance events to a greater level.and john!thank you for training me to what i am now.i'm terribly sorry i didnt break the record as you had hope for but cong broke it =) and as long as it is someone from the coe i guess you should be trilled.my promise to you is that i'll do my best in the US in my swimming and behave myself.haha.i'll stay away from the bars you can be sure of that!  having said all that i wanna say.i wish all you guys the very best in whatever you do be it swimming or studies.remeber to give 100 percent in everything you do cos just doing 99 percent alone will NEVER be enough.if you guys haven't know.me and unice will be leaving for the states at the end of the month.we're goign to swim and study at BYU for a peroid of time but we'll be back as long as we're free to visit our family and freinds.i'll keep this blog updated as much as possible to give you guys an insight of what we're doing there.in the mean time happy training and keep up the good work.let everyone know what we at the coe are truly made off and dont disappoint john!cheers people!      nat.i'll return for you.thats a promise.
