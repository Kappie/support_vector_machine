I mainly just slept in...walked the dog...wished the weather would improve enough for tennis or something...but bah.  Went food shopping yesterday, managed to get lotsa vanilla custard donuts, cookies and other assorted crap. And I got me a lotto ticket. Wooo.   After that, went to Cribbs to pick up some other crap, and managed to get Timesplitters 2 and Ratchet 'n' Clank for £25. Which isnt bad, seeing as that'd probably cost between £40 and £60 normally. Both games kick ass, by the way. Eeeeeveryone knows about 'splitters, but R'n'C seems to be a lil less well known. Lemme explain.  You play this lil squirrel thing who is a mechanic. He backtalks a fair bit and generally looks cool. (Em says "cuuute") His main weapon is a  giant spanner  which you basically smash stuff up with, which rules so much. All the other weapons you can get are pretty cool too, and most of them are bigger than the lil guy. Like...the 'suck cannon'. Its like...more fun than SSX Tricky. Which is a damned fun game.  But anyways. That should do fer now. Au revoir mes amigos.
