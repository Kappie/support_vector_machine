I've spent most of the day losing time to trivial activities [in other words I took a siesta this afternoon] instead of revising for my  politically correct  German test tomorrow.  Its one thing to be hit with buzzwords like 'equal opportunities' and other social issues during lessons designated for such wastes of time but I think its taking things too far to be able to understand that: Ich halte Gleichberechtigung f√ºr sehr wichtig Which roughly means; I think equal opportunities are very important I could also inform you of how to say how to say something is racist or sexist... isn't this going too far? What are majority of people going to do with a GCSE in German? Some may go on to A Level, and then maybe take it to degree level but that's quite rare, shouldn't we focus on things that  will  be of use, not how to talk about people being 'der Gruppendruck' [peer pressure] or 'die Arbeitslosigkeit' [unemployment]. Let's focus on what will be of use, not what's 'politisch korrekt' [I think you can guess that one].  Oh I also had a dream last night; I am back in school [again] and I'm feeling quite lost, suddenly someone who I used to be seeing for a while runs up to me and talks to me briefly, she then moves in to kiss me but instead tears the flesh of my face. She runs off and I also go off and see a small year 9 girl who tells me that she ate my face. I respond 'yes, she did eat my face'. I carry on and no one else notices my absent face. Like I always say; Fetch Freund.  Music: REM - Get Up Mood: Quite jovial Site:  urlLink http://www.online-literature.com/doyle/study_scarlet/
