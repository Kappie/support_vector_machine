Funniest:  Me shouting to random girls who were advertising a car wash (from a car window at 25 mph) "GET A REAL JOB!".  Rod laughs his ass off.  Because we are returning from our 'job'.  Saddest/funniest/weirdest:  Logan.  Hahaha.    Suprising: Finding Bartuc's cut throat  Enjoyable:  Leading 2 invasion maps in a 24 person server.  Fun!  Psychadelic:  hahahahahha  Ok, I'm out for now.
