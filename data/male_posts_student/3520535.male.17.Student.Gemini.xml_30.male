Skipped my first three classes because I had a project due in english. Found out I did well on the SOLs though - a 600 on the reading at least. Then Zach didn't wait for me after school. At least I got to talk to Chelsea tonight - I'm glad that the band is back from NY. I am of course a bit jealous, but I did go to Spain when most were still in the US. Except Noah. He's gotten to go to both. (One day I'll have to write about the use of gotten as a past participle.) I want to go walking. If I go too far though I'll probably get the fucking dogs barking at me again. Oh well. I can leave this place in a year. And that's something I've grown to concern myself with more and more. I need to focus on my schoolwork. I don't really have a life - I'm not doing anything else really, I'm just so damn lazy. But Mrs. Ressler's right - anyone who has a 730 SAT verbal score has no reason for failing English. So, I grow to doubt myself. I don't know that I'll be able to accomplish what I want for my life. My friends will surpass me and move on and I'll be left alone. I bit melodramatic, I know, but possible nonetheless. Dammit. I can't allow that to happen. There will be time for everything I want later. Maturity is overriding one's short term desires for greater benefit. Can I do that? Is it feasable at this point? I'm sure it is if I bust my ass on pointless shit. In any event, I can always take my A+ Certification after next year, move to Australia, hope they accept it there, and repair computers for the rest of my life.
