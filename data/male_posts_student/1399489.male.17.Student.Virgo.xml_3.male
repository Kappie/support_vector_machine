Well its 3 in the morn and i just got home from prom....Bryndan spent the night last night and we had a good ole time even thought i wasnt feelin really good :)  Donovan and kathrine yall are fun.  then when i took bryndan home i went a picked up my flower for prom and came home and got rdy.  then when i was leaving to go to prom i had to urge to stop by jessicas and say hey b/c i was all fixed up and i wanted her to see so i did. it was cool but seemed kinda weird at the same time.  then we got to prom early so and we didnt really feel like going in so i went to get coffee so i could stay up.  it worked for the most part i was wide awake until about 1 then i started crashing.  ohh yeah but at the dance the food was really good!!! and they had good cheesecake!  the music and stuff was pretty good to and it was fun at first i was kinda shy but then i started dancing more so it was all good.  then after prom we were gonna go to the mcfarlands for breakfast but we didnt see anybody so we left.  i was guessin brendon stopped on his way home and i just didnt feel like sitting there waiting.  then we were gonna go to salonas but they hadnt finished the senior breakfast yet so we just went to catie caskeys for about 30 min and by that time after all the driving around she had to be home.  so i took her home and came back here and that was about the extent of my prom night.  i was hoping there would be some nice after party but noope so that kinda did suck but o well i still had a good time.  for some reason lots of things latley have been reminding me of jessica.  just little things i see or eat or do.  its happening a lot more than it was just thought i would throw that in there to tell everybody i dunno why.  but i need to go now b/c im about to pass out from being tired and i gotta do some stuff tomorrow, including the damn 16 page spanish packet, so i will write some more some other time. later and g'night.
