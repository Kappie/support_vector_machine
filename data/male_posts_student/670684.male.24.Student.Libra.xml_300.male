So I'm at the Naples Public Library, a fantastic Spanish-style structure bustling full of genealogy books and pretentious old assholes.  Forgive me, but I don't owe old people shit just because they're old...wait your fucking turn to use the computer.    Naples has one of the largest Me First attitudes I've known in America...this is a deep knowledge of a number of American cities, including all of SoCal.  Naples fits right in...middle-class folks are looked upon as poor, and they hate it, so they're struggling to look better than they are...the new rich, the rich that are rich just by bank account at the moment, they are the true assholes of the land, feeling like Canaan is here, and we are the Baalites, owing them all of our manna, milk, honey, bread, and goodly posessions.   My mom really wants to read the blog.  She and I have a pretty good relationship, but I know few people as prude, and while she likes my liberalness on social sentimentalities, when it comes to discussing my shits and sex life, I'm pretty sure she'd read, smile, say "That's okay, pookey," and slowly cry away her pain.    My trusty Samsung Cell Phone is just about dead...range is atrocious, and the battery just lasts a few hours, much less if I dare talk on it.  It's old...there's no fancy letter-number sequence code for the phone (the TX015 or the L98E721)...it's just the black Samsung cell phone.  I bought it in August 2000 from the Sprint store in Shreveport...it was refurbished, originally bought in early 1998.  The phone is large, mostly owing to the battery...it plays ten different rings; three of them songs and seven variations on brrrrrrrrriiiinngggg...its best feature is vibrate, the setting I would leave it on during Latin class so if anyone called me, my pocket would rumble and Corey McMullin and Joanna Taggert would smile, causing Dr. Clark, who was unaware of the phone, to question their dedication to Quintus Augstus Flaccus.    Is it odd to not want to give up a cell phone?  It's not like the 1978 Volvo G260 Stationwagon, the yellow beast that was in my family from birth until April 18, 2001...but in a way it is.  Flann O'Brien says our objects become us and we become our objects, so in a way that cell phone is truly attached to my right ear, sometimes attached to my left when I'm talking to a girl and get that ear sweat that causes the hand switch, but quickly switching back because I'm just not used to using the cell phone on the left ear.  Jean Baudrillard says that our objects are just objects, with no symbolic meaning whatsoever.  Perhaps packrats are fighting Baurdillard's cause, keeping their posessions long after use-value is gone just because it will always mean more to them than it will to someone else, or it will to a trash heap.    Lots of movies the past two weeks...Finding Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean, Winged Migration, Seabiscuit, and today, American Wedding.  Just two of us in the theatre, but there were still laugh-out-loud points.  Of course, I laugh out loud quite frequently...moreso than any person I know, save John Hubbard, who could find a career in theatre circles as a constant patron, being paid to watch plays and laugh uproariously, thus making the other theatregoers feel more comfortable in exercising their chuckles.  Great characters in that bit...sad that the cameos I hoped for from Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Klein, and Tara Reid were for naught...but they did a good job with the few they stuck on, save Thomas Ian Nicholas, whose agent didn't do a good job of securing him more than a face and three bad lines for the final of the trilogy.  Eugene Levy is incredible yet again.
