So i was like screw it I'll change it for the better.   I am watching my sister play with her son. He just got a haircut, and she does not like it so much. I just got a haircut too. I just got a trim and it looks pretty kool. Both of my sister's kids went hysterical when they got their hair cuts. It was funny, but sad at the same time. We had to shove a lollipop into my neice's mouth to stop her from crying.   I pretty much had a crappy day. Aw well. School sucked. Looking forward to a better tomorrow. Well Blog on people.
