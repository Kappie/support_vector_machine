So far so good, so major upz to them for fixing it.  On that note, I just realized that the renew date on the personal domain name had indeed run out, but  Pac Net , having good customer service, has automatically renewed it for another year. So it looks like I won’t be looking for a new web host anytime soon. Maybe towards the end of the year, when I have gotten my money’s worth of the renewal fee and itching to expand the site again, then I’ll bring it up again.  Till then…it’s good to be back.
