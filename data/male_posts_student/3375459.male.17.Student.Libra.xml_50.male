Guess i was holding the pencil a little too tight, and there was so many lines to draw to darker. But these two cards sure look damn good, don't you agree? I still have some simple cards left, so i guess i'll start on those tommorw morning and make my way to the toughtest card, which i think is "The Wood" card (lots of leaves to darw). Well before that, think i'm gonna rest my fingers first. *yawn~*
