Anyone who reads my blog and anyone who really knows me would know that I'm walking around with a gaping hole in my soul. Something I lack - the feeling of being loved. It came up as looking for love and acceptance in the area of music, fame and popularity. Also appeared as the constant desire for that love and acceptance to come in the form of a one person - my soulmate.  But I was at a point in my life where I was just broken. Running on empty. And yeah, it felt like I was walking around with a huge gaping hole in the core of my very being.  Not now. Not anymore.   Lord I give you me I give you my all I hold nothing back I'm answering your call Though I live or die Your glory is my life My royal destiny Lord I give you me  Lord I give you me It may not look like much I know that I need change I know I need your touch Take me as I am Place me in your plan That's where I want to be  Lord I give you me Lord with every breath I worship you in life I worship you in death I lay down my heart That's all I have to give As long as I live Lord I give you me   I've got to go for Prayer Meeting soon but I'll finish this post when I get back...  See yawl Rock on peeps. Sir Germy ;)
