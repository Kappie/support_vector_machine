But then I've got two regents afterwards--global history and chemistry.  I'm probably just going to re-read my SAT II book as preparation for the History regents and I guess read over the chapters that we covered this year in chemistry in preparation for that.  Both regents should be easy enough--chemistry being harder than history.  I might go to the Puerto Rican Day Parade this weekend, I probably will in fact.
