     
      It's the second day of classes and already things have started at a brisk pace. After the first day alone, I had close to 100 pages of reading to do! My schedule is set up rather nicely, though, with a 2+ hour gap between my two classes - just long enough to give me time to study or hit the gym, and just short enough to keep me from leaving the University.  Though not wallowing in my own financial crapulence by  any  means, my 8-day stint with Tri-City has afforded me a bit of dreaming room. Canadian Tire has a particular set of  urlLink goaltender pads  which has piqued my interest. Coupled with a new blocker/catcher set, these elegant  34"  pads will certainly cover a few more holes in the net. My first priority at the moment, however, is covering the moving expenses for the new apartment Nicole and I will be moving in to, especially a new barbecue for our gigantic River Valley-viewing patio! The new goalie equipment, however, is certainly a close second.  This upcoming weekend we plan to drive on down to Cowtown to enjoy the Stampede, which is infinitely better than Klondike Days, though we won't be leaving until Saturday morning. In the meantime, we're looking for a place to stay...sooooo,  George  does your Uncle mind a few transients in his place over the weekend? If not, Nicole has a cousin we might be able to stay with, but your  diseased  company would be much more fun.  And yes, Scott, if you pitch in a few dollars for gas, we could probably bring you along, but you'll be missing Finger Eleven is they're playing on Friday.
