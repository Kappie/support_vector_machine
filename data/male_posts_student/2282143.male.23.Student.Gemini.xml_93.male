It makes me very sad that you parents cant go for a fifteen minute car ride without putting on some sort of entertainment for those in the back seat.  I mean, really, WTF mate?  I just dont understand it, our constant need for the media and television and how we just plop our children in front of moving pictures instead of letting them use their brain.  I MEAN FUCKING REALLY!  A car ride:  Probably the biggest chunk of conscious time in our life when we arent subjected to the TV.  Now that has changed.  Now if you want, you can rot your brain in the comfort of your Escalade that consumes enough energy to power your house for a month.  And THIS is why all of our problems arent solved.  This is why people want to blow us up.  Cause they dont have enough food to feed their family and we watch TV in our fucking cars.  And this is added to Mike's Agression list (cause it makes me crazy and no, I wont punch anyone, its just symbolic of the things that I find wrong with society).  Yargh.
