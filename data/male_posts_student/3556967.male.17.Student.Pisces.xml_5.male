I noe i've been pestering lots of ppl esp walter, yiyong, galvin to take 2.4km timings for e past few weeks ever since xp. i've suggested tough trainings and jus yesterdae proposed we do circuit training. yes, I noe i've been acting like an ass recently and I'm starting to get on e nerves of sum. I'm really sry if I appear to u like sum cocky bastard or obnoxious brat hu thinks he's very fit. I jus wanna haf trainings where we can push ourselves 2 e limit so tt we can improve and become more solid ppl, if not at least atheletes. but I agree tt I may haf been a little overboard and lost e whole idea, so dun worry i'll keep my mouth shut e next time I haf sum stupid ideas k?  btw, I wanna really sae sry to rao. i noe it's e i-dunno-how-many-th time i've been sayin this but still i feel real bad for whacking my gd fren in e face liddat. we were playin soccer afta training and I accidentally slammed e ball into his face shattering his spec lens. i was damn scared shards would end up in his eye or smth but luckily he was ok. thank god. but really rao, i didn't mean it, but if u want or ur parents sae anything i'll pay for ur new glasses. it's e least i can do. i juz hope tt u r alright, if u want 2 u can always slam a ball in my face if it makes u feel better k? i mean it.
