When Max finished his burger I was just a couple of good bites away from finishing it, but I was stuffed. After I told him I was full, he leaned over and said, “I’ll give you a buck if you dip your burger in this ranch dressing.” I didn’t back down. Then he said he was gonna dip it in the dressing. Man-oh-man! He drenched that sucker! And lemme tell ya, it was a fat bite! The second he hands it to me I immediately put it in my mouth and eat the ranch dressing drenched burger and was chewing away. After a couple of seconds the taste kicks in. I almost felt like gaggin’ so Max was gonna pay me 2 bucks. Anyways, I finished it and thankfully found a breath mint. As Max and I walked to the car I realized that there are people who actually eat their burgers with ranch dressing.  *Note to self - Never eat a hamburger with an ass-load of ranch dressing.
