A trap that you both like and dislike, wish for and deny... that one called love. Of course, if you haven't guessed, this is all about a girl... girls cause problems... lol Some of you may have never really had this before, this feeling. See, it's indescribably different than having a crush on someone. You just... feel. It's different - I've hade plenty of crushes, and 'likes'. I should know.  I found some resemblence to my situation in a song by Shania Twain, lol. "...and it only hurts when I'm breathing, My heart only breaks when it's beating, My dreams only die when I'm dreaming, So I'll hold my breath, to forget..."  Sad that I can relate to songs but then Country does that to people. So what is there to do? In impossible stuations like this one, not much. It's a lose-lose situation. No matter what you do or say... Well. My heart's breaking, dreams are dying, and I can't hold my breath.  Will write more tomorrow when I'm more sane. 2:00 am can get depressing. like Andy says:  The Game Is Flawed
