After reading Lisa's "On Weblogs" (sidebar -> links), which displays an almost angry look at those blogs that aren't hers, I've started to think about why I don't similarly draft, proof-read, and then double-check my blog posts. I think my feeling is that my posts exist in a similar manner to my speech - it all comes out in whatever order it wants to, and neither dam nor really big plastic bung will stop it. Also I try and post at least once every day (I also fail quite a lot), and as a result I can't always be certain that a large amount has happened on the day. I think my feeling is that, as a blog reader, I'd prefer to see something interesting but haphazard than boring but well-planned. Obviously, me losing readers seems to disprove that... oh well.  Love, Jon Roskilly
