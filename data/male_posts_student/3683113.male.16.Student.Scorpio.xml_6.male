I aim to create a journal of a variety of musical, social and political commentary by myself and others. Yes, I may not seem the most tech-savvy, bloggish type. And actually I did not make this page myself. Props to my good friend Eitan "Fuckface" Freedenberg. I realize starting this shit on this server is pretty easy, but what the hell - I got someone to do my work for me. That is always a good thing.  Anyway, a real post should be coming soon.
