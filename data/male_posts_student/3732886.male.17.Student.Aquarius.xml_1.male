After I finished my scrumptious lunch I went  upstairs and talked on AIM for a little while. I talked to Heather, a friend of  mine from school, about all the lovely affairs that she's having. I kinda had a  thing for her, as in I would if I could, but it's very unattractive when she's  writing me telling me how she's hooking up with her ex-bf's roommate, while  she's talking to this one motherfucker from Oklahoma who she had a one nighter  with when she was staying over there...I don't know, you know?       When I was done listening to my  slutty friend I listened to Tool's Lateralus CD, It kicked ass!!! Not as if it's  the first time I listen to it or anything but it kicks ass!! that killed an hour  and a half after which I had to go off to work. My Dad took me, and of course as  always a deathly silence was in the air the entire trip. We said two words to  each other, both were by him. I don't know why but my Dad pisses me off, what  pisses me off is I don't know what. He tries to get close to me but I won't have  any of it. Time will hopefully tell.      Shelley, Erica, and Iwhere  working today. Our boss Carlos was supposed to be working but couldn't because  his car broke down. I don't think I've talked about Erica so to describe her:  she's around 5,3 and 22 pounds, skinny as shit! She's a brunette of Hispanic  decent(even though she doesn't speak Spanish). Now to talk about her skinniness,  when we first saw her the only thing I could think of was Callista Flockhart.  That skinny!! Anyways, all she talked about today, were all the drugs she's done  in the past, how she came to work high, and how she was going to smoke and drink  so much tonight...lovely. I've known this girl for about a week, and she's  acting like we've known each other so long that we need to share our troubled  path...what the fuck!!! It pissed me off, although the drug thing might also  have something to do on why she's so skinny.       I started talking to Shelley  about how much it's starting to piss me off working there. I told her how I was  starting to hate the job. It's so fucking pointless!! All we do is fold shirts.  I have no adventure in my life. Just read this fucking journal and you can tell  to what point is my level of excitement. That's one of the main reasons why I  want to go to the Marines, and become a Marine sniper. Reconnaissance would be  the best thing for me, training for impossible missions, andnever taking a  step backward and doing things that others don't dare do. I need that in my  life.Nothing else to talk about work.       Fahrenheit 9/11 came out today  and I'm hoping I get a chance to see it Sunday, if anyone else decides to go  with me. I need better friends, I don't enjoy my friends right now. I haven't  talked to any of them for around a month. Theyhaven't even called me. I'm  tired and now I'm pissed off so I'm going to go to  bed.
