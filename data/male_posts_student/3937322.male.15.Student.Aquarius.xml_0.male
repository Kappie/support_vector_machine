Seroiusly hope that can, so that I can break the unwanted record of people from my primary school not being CCALs or ACCALs in RI. Currently writing my election script . Have a feeling that it's a tad too long. Will edit it tomorrow. Still gotta mug for Maths test (should not be too difficult). Got to install QBasic compilers on all the comps in ComLab 3 tomorrow during recess and Maths test is rite after. Dunno whether can make it or not.  Snore... Feel like sleeping now. Gotta finish my script and go get some rest now.
