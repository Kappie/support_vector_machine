AND a seventh man (more like an honorary position, as you will see if you bother scrolling down [which you will, because that unfinished sentence at the bottom of the screen is very tempting {hmm, how many tangentially inane comments can i add to one sentence?}]). cuz it's my blog, dammit.  point guard: jalen rose, toronto raptors. i have to offer belated thanks to james for trading this 6'8" baller (and member of michigan's fab five) from detroit to me (along with the nba's leading shot-blocker theo ratliff for the schizophrenic yao ming, who on some days looks more like an asian gheorge muresan). rose himself was traded by chicago along with donyell marshall, but their collective talent paired with vince carter and chris bosh could not bring the turnaround the only nba team in canada was hoping for.  yes, jalen is not a point, but he's long and he does have passable ... er ... passing skills, a great scoring touch (with almost no vertical leap on his jump shot), and the post-up talent required at the three.   shooting guard: if you have to ask...  small forward: rashard lewis, seattle supersonics. yes, for opening my eyes to this straight-from-HS dunking whiz, i must give due pleasantries to erik (who got the one-dimensional reggie miller clone richard hamilton in return). unfortunately, lewis is a maddeningly enigmatic mixed bag of ambiguity. in the sonics' second game of the year (in japan versus the pitiful los angeles clippers), lewis busted out a career-high 50 points, revealing to the world his amazing stroke and posting ability. in addition, his great vertical leap leads to some thunderous dunks and high rebounding statistics. unfortunately, he has just as often been found missing (oxymoron) on the court, unable to take control because of his passive tendency to defer to sharpshooter ray allen when the going gets tough. if he gains size and aggressiveness, he could truly become a star.  power forward: drew gooden, orlando magic. (carlos boozer has great hops and presence but a smaller shooting range, inability to do much besides shoot and rebound, and relies too often on his pedestrian "monster" jams. nazr mohammad hasn't proven himself yet, but at least he can get some blocks.) not another potential talent that can't bring 100% every night! and he's somewhat small for the four, but gooden can be a talented shooter, rebounder and shot-blocker when he has motivation and juwan howard isn't doing the exact same thing (except for the shot-blocking and talent part). stupid johnny davis playing him at the three, GOODEN ISN'T QUICK ENOUGH ON DEFENSE. not much else to say except orlando should trade howard and keep him.  center: tim duncan, san antonio spurs. who doesn't want him? the reigning nba mvp, two-time nba finals mvp, sports illustrated co-sportsman of the year (along with all-time great david robinson), he is just that rare player who lets his actions do the talking. and boy does he have a lot of actions. perenially ranking at the top in the league in scoring, rebounding and shot-blocking, and exhibiting halfway-decent passes and handles, he (like the unstoppable kevin garnett) are individual teams. duncan is so consistently impressive, with graceful pivot moves and that trademark kiss off the glass, steady defense and a heartening lack of violent gesticulations and showboating, and a human shortcoming in his slowly deteriorating free-throw percentage, that it is quite difficult to omit him off any partly serious list of the greatest players in league history.   sixth man: kirk hinrich, chicago bulls. finally i've enlisted a true point guard, one who along with the injured nick collison led kansas to the final four and a showdown with 'melo, with the confidence to rain threes like so much precipitation (even with a notoriously streaky stroke), weave between defenders to thread a pass down the lane, drive up the sideline to dunk it on somebody's grille, and actually play lockdown defense (almost as rare as four-point plays these days). hinrich has amazing energy and adapts to any coach's schemes with ease. unfortunately, his considerable efforts have done little to help chicago out of their deep poophole.  seventh man: penny hardaway, new york knicks (but let's pretend orlando magic for my sake). DAMN HE WAS SO GOOD. this junior high kid that babysat me when i was at kindergarten age, he had penny's third-color pinstriped jersey. i drew his goatee all the time. AAH. his grandmother inadvertently named him penny because her southern accent slurred the t's and r in "pretty." i remember how he had those great battles with michael jordan, john stockton, nick van exel, jason kidd, whomever. he could dunk and shoot and pass and post like nobody's business, and along with shaquille o'neal, orlando made it to the nba finals only to get SWEPT by rudy tomjanovich's houston rockets with hakeem olajuwon and sam cassell. he won a gold medal at the 1996 olympic games. hell, he was all over sports illustrated for kids. STUPID KNEE INJURY CRAP. now he sorta sucks.  holy crap, that was a little longer than i wanted. but now here i go with playoff predictions. they shall be brief, to spare your tired, your huddled, your completely closed eyes...   divisional playoffs  indiana over cleveland in 5 new york over new jersey in 6 (assuming kidd is still injured) detroit over new orleans in 4 miami over milwaukee in 7 (great matchup, odom > van horn)  los angeles over portland in 5 minnesota over houston in 6 sacramento over dallas in 6 memphis over san antonio in 6 (spurs last year > this year)   conference semifinals  indiana over new york in 6 detroit over miami in 6  los angeles over memphis in 6 (lakers vs. jerry west, cool) sacramento over minnesota in 7 (webber shall be finally 100%)   conference finals  detroit over indiana in 7 los angeles over sacramento in 7 (the NBA NEEDS this series)   nba finals  los angeles over detroit in 6, mvp: kobe bryant   end of season awards  most valuable player: kevin garnett defensive player of the year: ron artest rookie of the year: lebron james and carmelo anthony most improved player: zach randolph coach of the year: hubie brown
