I have a couple days left as a Freshman and I can say I'm glad I'm getting it over with. Take Music class for example. Our teacher, his name is Mr. Kibler is using the last days of school having 3rd Period, thats all the freshman players including me, sort his music. While his angelic, sophomore, Junior and senior first period get to relax, go on the computers (which he password protected AGAINST FRESHMAN!) and just relax. Umm.. excuse me.. but isn't that YOUR JOB? As long as the guy has control over my grade though I'm not gonna take it up with him personal. But when I come to visit from South Carolina (I'm moving!) I'm gonna ask him, "So... still making Freshman the sorting b*tches around here?" The guy ticks me off sometimes.   Another thing thats getting on my nerves is all the work we're being assigned even though its the end of the year! I have a ton of Biology crap to make up so i get my grade back up from a B to an A. School such a freaking pain.   Now at home I have to start packing. I have to start getting my crap together in boxes, which isn't all that bad.. but I'm half dreading the day I'm moving. I'm gonna miss my friends. Damn. Guess I better enjoy whats left and hate whats left to hate.
