We've finished shooting one film and started  on our second. I Really enjoy imagining the story through a camera  filter, and planning out the scenes and shot and angles and my oh my,  it just gets me  hot.    B) bicycles are fun. I've been exploring, all the way out to the  boonies of Short Hills, and West Orange in the opposite direction. I've  ridden a bit with Goldy, but I'm not so sure he shares my passion for  riding as far as possible. Maybe Dip will come with me to the end of  the world.   C) Camps are hours away. So much time went into making a package for  Andy, but I got it shipped out today from Mail Boxes Etc., and it felt  good. It consists of two letters written about a week apart, 17 CD's,  and one of my favorite comics. I wrapped it in a piece of newsprint  which I had drawn over and colored in one of the pictures of. It's also  wrapped with a bow.   D) Church sales are great. I haven't gotten that many clothes because  I'm broke, but the few shirts I've bought are just wonderful. All of  them are especially light for the upcoming heat. I still only own 3 or  4 pairs of shorts though. Maybe it's time I cut me some new ones.   "Alright pants, It's go-time, just you and me, and the scissors"  "Pants pants pants pants!"  "Shut the hell up you!" Cutting ensues...   I got a copy of "A Ghost Is Born" by Wilco from my dad the other day. I  really like it, and am starting to really get into Wilco.   Next on my agenda this afternoon is to go clean out my car a bit. It's  got weird stuff growing and stinking it up, since it's been untouched  for so long. I sure hope I can get it so fresh and so clean.   Sorry if I've been brief, but the Windex and Febreeze is calling to me.   xoxo - Jono
