Our awesome newborn charter school--now in it's second year!--had its orientation/open house-thinger today for the 2004/05 (is that correct?) school year. I got to see faces from the days of yore--including my preciously adorable Mexican,  urlLink Ximena ; a newly-bleached  urlLink Christine ; the  urlLink new  improved --according to  urlLink Zara  [ urlLink blog ]-- urlLink Jack ; the tremendously amusing  urlLink Vickie  [ urlLink myspace ]; the positively radiant  urlLink Mary ; the hideously unnatractive--again, according to Zara-- urlLink Powell ; and the  absolutely stunning   urlLink Theresa . I failed miserably to get a photo of Theresa, since I didn't have film and my digital camera sucks twat--and since Zara hogged her digital camera and  didn't even take any photos!       After a brief assembly at Zara's house, Zara and I wheeled down to the new VAPAC capus site (click here--no,  urlLink here --to visit their curiously never-updated site--watch the "PSA", featuring frosh Emily and Frank in his pajamas! And I'm pretty sure I'm in it somewhere as well). Upon arrival at the gorgeous new site, I immediately orgasmed and then went to find Theresa. After searching and searching to no avail, I settled for her sister, Vickie, and Zara. We did something that I forgot about, then I went to get my schedule, which was all backasswards--and since the senior counselor wasn't available I couldn't fix my classes, which is--contrary to popular belief--completely gay.      Later, after fucking Zara in the janitor's closet, I spotted Mary and instantly got pissed off. I think I talked to her and her mom for like five seconds or something, but I was getting anxious at the fact that I couldn't find Theresa, so I ditched those bitches and discovered Theresa just as she was arriving with her other sister--Brittany--and her parents. I freaked out at the sight of her, for I am an idiot, and ran off to find Zara.      After doing some more forgettable shit with Zara and Jack, we decided to go to  urlLink 7-11  (linked for the convenience of you hosers that may not have 7-11's in your hometown) across the street. After forcing Zara to invite Theresa and Brittany--as well as some random black chick--we set out to for 7-11. On the way we came across Ximena being cute and Mexican, so we kidnapped her and brought her with us. The cool people (Jack, Ximena, Zara, and I) bought Slurpees--or "slooshies", according to retard Zara--and the other chicks bought boring-ass Snapple and soda. I bought a badass tabloid magazine and then we went back to the school.      While Zara and Vickie were whoring themselves out to some creep rapists, I worked on seducing Theresa. I'm pretty sure she is at least  a little  smitten with me--even Zara said she thinks that Theresa likes me, and Zara's the most disapproving about this whole thing. She's a seventh-grader, and even though she may act a little mature for her age, she's still going to show her admiration the way a seventh-grader does. She kept taking my cell, and she stole my sweater and wore it around her neck. Oh, and she was acting a little shy. That's what seventh-graders do when they're in love, no?      Anyway, later on Christine showed up and I gave her a hug, pissing off her stupid-ass boyfriend in the process. Jealous guys can all suck my cock. At the same time. Please?      After losing my tabloid, my parents showed up. My dad--up from San Francisco--bought me and Zara and Vickie lunch, but Zara was being creepy and shy and stubborn and didn't eat anything--my dad thinks she's anorexic now. Fortunately, Vickie made up for Zara's loserness by being her usual lovable self. My dad still loved Zara though--he called her a "firecracker".      Anysuch,  urlLink Laurel  [ urlLink blog ], I hope you're having a fun -chuck-less weekend.  (SARCASM)              -chuck-   ...or eat limes...
