Heileybury is well reknowned for its great campus space, lush green ovals, over-populated teams who almost never win and teachers who just can't seem to get their strikes together.   Contrary to popular beliefs not a single bit of information that you, (apply own name) may have heard about Haileybury, I can say now, they are all lies. Let me firstly clear something up, Haileybury is not a school where dreams become reality, if any were to ever tell you that my suggestion would be kick them cause they have mental inconsistencies.  Secondly, Haileybury may suggest to you that they offer the greatest number of subjects, but be careful who you listen to and make sure you read the post scripts, they tend to contain more information (the important bits they don't want you to read).  Haileybury is a school, where the belief of success is what governs us, most people at Haileybury are within the vain belief that Success is merely an arms length away, poor them, such naivety. Haileybury prides itself on the success of its students and each year the decimation is at hand and the hand of reality is always ready to whip some sense into the people of this school.   When will the naivety of Haileybury blow over...
