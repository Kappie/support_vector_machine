It wasn't fair that I got the point too since even they admitted that I was the victim. I'll tell you one thing. It all hit me when I was mad. Sometimes, when you're mad, it all becomes very clear.  My sole rebuttal to the assailant was for him to cut out his egoistic ways. This would have been the equivilant of requesting him to shut up. Other than that, no other fault was mine. So why demerit victims? At the very worse, it was a judgment (I prefer to call it advice) on his behaviour which he was unable to accept. I have learnt a few things. Here are some of my thoughts.  ************************************************************* ************************************************************* ************************************************************* ************************************************************* ************************************************************* *************************************************************  There's more, but it all just stopped flowing coz mummy got on my case. Argh... very pissed now. Need to cool off. I hope God's about, coz I could really use his help.
