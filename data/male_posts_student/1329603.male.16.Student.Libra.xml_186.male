It was so good, an African firm, based in Egypt, decided to spend a great deal of money importing it, which would mean a journey across some very harsh desert land. As cars could not make their way through, they had to use a camel. The relay-man was very fat, but the camel had taken his weight before. Unfortunately, the combined weight of him and the well-packed program caused the camel's spine to snap, leaving the man stranded in the desert. What actually broke the camel's back?  A. MS Draw - it was the MS Draw that broke the camel's back.  Love, Jon Roskilly
