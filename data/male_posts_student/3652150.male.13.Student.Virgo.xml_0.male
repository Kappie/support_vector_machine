Competition in broadband services - and Internet bandwidth in general - is hotting up once more, thanks to wireless technology.   Pacific Internet (PacNet), the number three Internet service provider here, is set to offer an all-wireless broadband service to condominiums here in the coming months.    To be provided free of charge initially, it is part of a technology trial that may possibly open up the bandwidth market and let consumers and businesses surf the Net more cheaply.   Starting next month, residents of Katong Tower and The Anchorage can expect to go online wirelessly from their apartments. Each household will get up to 4Mbps of bandwidth.   PacNet is now installing Wi-Fi equipment to cover condo compounds, while a wireless backhaul connection links the condos to the ISP's Internet gateways.    Mr Wong Kok Hoou, PacNet's vice-president of engineering and network operations, told Computer Times that this is the first all-wireless broadband service in Singapore.   He expects about 10 condominiums - and about 100 households from each development - to sign up by the year's end. Prices for a commercial rollout are not finalised yet.  Wireless alternative   For home users, PacNet's wireless offering provides an alternative to similar services from SingTel and StarHub.   StarHub currently offers MaxOnline cable modem services and SingTel has its SingNet Broadband services which are based on asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL). An unlimited surfing service from either service provider costs about $55 a month.   Current cable modem user Joseph Goh, 29, said that PacNet's wireless service can make a difference if it offers more value. 'Price and speed are the main things users look for.'   Businesses will also be watching if such wireless services take off. The PacNet trial, which is partly funded by the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), appears to be another ambitious attempt to break up SingTel's monopoly on local leased circuits (LLCs).   LLCs are key telecoms infrastructure used to provide data, voice and Internet services to corporations. International telcos often rely on LLCs to connect their customers' regional offices to Singapore branches.   SingTel has about 60 per cent of the LLC market here, according to an IDA report released last year. Not surprisingly, many companies which lease LLCs from the dominant telco often complain about a lack of competition.   If PacNet's wireless link proves successful, the company - and indeed other telcos and their customers - may find an alternative to SingTel's wire line infrastructure.   This, according to an IDA spokesman, can make bandwidth prices more competitive. In turn, it becomes cheaper to go online.   Regulating thin air   Much now depends on how the IDA regulates new wireless technology. If it makes telcos pay a high price for the radio spectrum, they may stay put with the more reliable land lines.   In the past, the infocomm regulator has encouraged - with limited success - the building of an alternative infrastructure to SingTel's to boost Singapore's competitiveness in telecoms services.   In 2001, it tried auctioning part of the radio spectrum for a wireless technology known as local multipoint distribution service (LMDS). There were no takers because of the technology's limitations and the add-on cost of a licence from IDA.   Then came news last year that powerline communications (PLC), which makes use of electric cables to transfer data, would not be rolled out after several companies ran extensive trials on it.   Frost and Sullivan analyst Danny Tay said that wireless infrastructure will find its niche in the market place, but may face challenges in Singapore, which is well-wired with fibre optic cables.   He said that new wireless infrastructure, though a cheaper alternative to digging up roads to lay cables, is still add-on cost for ISPs like PacNet. In contrast, SingTel's fixed line network is 'sunk cost'.   SingTel was not overly worried when asked about PacNet's new wireless trials. Said spokesman Chia Boon Chong: 'Physical-line connections, such as fibre optic links, offer a more secure and reliable grade of service.'   HOW IT WORKS   It is expensive to dig up roads and lay network cables. So, many telcos and Internet service providers (ISPs) are making use of wireless technologies in the 'last mile' to hook up their business and residential customers to the Net.   Pacific Internet is using a proprietary radio frequency (RF) technology to offer its wireless broadband service. The ISP said that it makes use of the 2.5GHz spectrum and is capable of 10 to 14Mbps.   An antenna is set up on say, a condo in Katong, to transfer data to PacNet's Internet gateways in Science Park. At the condo, data is fed from the antenna receiver to end-users using Wi-Fi.
