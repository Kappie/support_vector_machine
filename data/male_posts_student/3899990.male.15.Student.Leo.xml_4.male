The video can be viewed at  urlLink http://www.linspire.com/run_linspire.php . Linspire is an alternative to Windows and as a matter of fact, they are against Windows and Microsoft 100%. Basically, it combines Windows and Linux together in one operating system. You can view more information about Linspire at  urlLink http://www.linspire.com  (formely known as Lindows). Take a look at it, I think you'll like it (especially if youdon't like Windows, Microsoft, and/or Bill Gates.
