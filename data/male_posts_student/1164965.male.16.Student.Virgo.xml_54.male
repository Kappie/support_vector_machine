By the way, did anyone notice how I used an elipsis instead of transition words there?  Basically, that's how I responded to the Emerson prompt.  Picked one or two conventions that seemed blatantly obvious, and beat them till they died, then beat them some more.  I can't tell if I was too redundant or not, but the familiarity with the author DEFINITELY eased the pain.  It made reading the passage go much smoother, and I felt not bad about it overall.  I was suprised at the Shakespeare prompt because it was so vast and wide, not really what I'm used to.  It also suprised me that it asked for Shakespeare (which I remembered enough of to respond), because he's super old and not American.  Overall I feel confident (more so after some grammar review), but this will not be my most difficult test.  Good luck to everyone!  Love, Rob
