I have just finished listening to dashboard. Again. Some songs are good, On balance, Some smell like the bottom end of a skunk. The good ones are top notch. Download them. My my my. Thats a very good use of repitition. can't keep this up and stay funny. I apologise. It will gradually dissolve in funnyness. Like prozac in the bloodstream. Asparin in water. Urine on matresses and other such analogies. I apologise. The urine thing was not required. Unlucky is a key word here. A one word phrase if you will. A deep sea voyage of the english language. Exit.
