I took the spanish regents today. It was relatively easy compared to the physics and it was relatively short compared to the global.   After the regents, I jus came home, ate breakfast and went to play basketball. Didn't play for long though because it was really humid outside. Afterwards, I just took a nap, and i'll probably go to the gym around 9.   On a side note, today marks the beginning of a new season of Nip Tuck. That's right! Nipt tuck is the best show on TV. Today at 10 pm on channel FX is the 1st episode of the second season. I'm not sure when they will show re-runs of the first season but you can buy the 1st season DVD on amazon.com if you're interested. Nip Tuck is a show about two plastic surgeons in Florida, Dr. Sean McNamara and Dr. Christian Troy. While Sean is the brains behind the operation and a family man, Christian is an eccentric playboy who pretty much gets a new girl every night and always gets himself and Sean into illegal business deals/surgeries and ofcourse Sean is forced to clean his shit up....anyway i'm not gonna tell the whole story here but the show is AWESOME, I highly recommend it.   That's all for now kiddies.
