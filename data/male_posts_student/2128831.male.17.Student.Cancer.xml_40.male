There is this airfield and we went out on it together and well... yeah.  One orgasm there... Then we went back to my house at 9 and watched "A View from the Top" and well, we really didn't watch the movie because umm... yeah.  Another orgasm and then the third was like before the ball dropped.  And he got me Christmas presents and they were "My Favorites" Flowers and Leaves for Spring and Fall (seasons), a platypus stuffed animal (animal), a bottle of iced tea with lemon (drink),  a shotglass from a cheesecake factory (dessert), Mexican rice (food), a noise maker when I get laryngitis because I speak a lot.    AND NOW MY WI BEST FRIEND WISHES TO HAVE MORE THAN MY FRIENDSHIP:  Over the past two weeks or however long it has exactly been, I have fallen in love with you.  You are a very strong young man with a lot of drive and some definite goals.  You also have morals.  That's what attracted me to you the most.  Sure your stunningly good looks and beautiful southern accent don't hurt, but your personality has grabbed a hold of my heart and won't let go.  I have tried to let go of these feelings and I just can't do it.  I want you as a part of my life, Will.  I know you've said that you want me to be your best friend, but please, give that title to someone else.  I want to be the boyfriend in this situation.  I know I may not have Freddie Prinze Jr's great looks or Conan O'Brian's humor, but I am ME and I'm not afraid to give you every last part of me.  I love you, Will, and I am going to continue to love you no matter what you do that I may not approve of or how many miles come between us.  (Direct quote)   So my heart is torn and my body feels battered much like it did in Virginia.  God damn confliction of emotions seizing me up. I am sorry to all parties involved, I seems I always can fuck shyte up. Yep go Will! HAPPY FRICKING NEW YEAR!
