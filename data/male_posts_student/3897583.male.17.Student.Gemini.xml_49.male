It is also facing a trial in court for giving so much space i.e. 1 GB. It will most likely win. If gmail runs successfully for 6 months then it can be signed up by everybody. Except the fact of 1Gb MAIL free of cost gmail will also edit ur original messages by giving photos of whatever is written in the mail i.e. if a camera is typed then a colorful picture of a camera will be seen.
