I will probably be late getting on here tonight, but I know You will wait up for me, right? ;).  Heh. The cheese.  On a lighter note: My birthday is almost upon us, yo! Today, I believe is the 7th of October, meaning my birthday is exactly one month away! Also, one month until the third Matrix movie hits theatres. What is Tanner doing for his birthday? Well, isn't it obvious? (for those of you who aren't that quick on the uptake, he's going to see the goddammed movie, yo!)  *cough*  Well. To work I go.   it's a little bit funny
