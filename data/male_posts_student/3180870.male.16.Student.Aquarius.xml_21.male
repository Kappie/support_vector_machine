Her music isn’t exactly anything cutting edge but it isn’t like anything else I know. I can’t exactly put my thumb on why the only thing I’ve listened to is her latest record, The Disconnection, for the last seven days. I read an article from the London Times about her and somehow she is not very popular in her homeland except for a small group of hardcore fans (family?). It’s not like I like this music just because it’s a little different from what’s out there right there (I mean people are still listening to that song “Meant to Live” by Switchfoot) but there’s something about her music. Maybe it’s her very soft and diverse voice that blends into the music like a Manta Ray slipping into the ocean floor. Or the off beats of the drumsticks hitting the snare to give the music a jazzier feel. Maybe the real five-foot bass that gives the music that real authentic feel. I often find myself rocking my head, which is something I’ve definitely been trying to avoid for a while. It is a little on the dark side and definitely not all that poppy. I’m glad she’s getting popular, I guess, (she’s already been on MTV once or twice) but hopefully she’ll latch to a darker crowd like the Donnie Darko movie.   The Donnie Darko movie is going to be re-released, I’m not sure when or if it already has, but it’s coming out. I like the movie, it is good, but is it really that good? It seems that a lot of kids my age have adopted the movie as their favorite. I remember asking my peers at the beginning of the school year if they had even heard of the movie. Usually, I would just get a puzzled look of confusion for not asking about Bad Boys II. Is it annoying or aggravating? It wouldn’t be if they could understand but it’s good that a new and a much bigger crowd will be experiencing something very new, something very demented. I think that’s the thing that got the movie its newfound popularity, teenagers being able to identify with a hallucinogenic psychotic. I’m not going to go ranting about SUV’s, McDonalds, and how rich we are but god damn, us teens need to fucking suck it up.
