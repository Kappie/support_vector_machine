I already checked out the Davidson campus, and I guess it was pretty cool. At 1:30 today I'm driving up to Chapel Hill to look at UNC. From there, I'm heading  aaaaaalllll  the way up to Lexington, Virginia to check out Washington and Lee.  While everyone else is out enjoying their lives I'm sitting here infront of the computer having an anxiety attack.  Martha's in Mexico with Kaitlyn and Rachel. I wanted to go, but it wouldn't have worked with her friends there. She hasn't seen them enough anyways, and I'd just aggravate things.  We've been getting mad at eachother a lot lately.... I can't stand it.... Every time we make up I turn around and do something stupid without realizing it, or she's just in a really bad mood to begin with.  ...but I really miss her.  I need her.  I love her.  And so the time comes in my life where I don't want to grow up anymore. Why would I? New responsibilities, leaving the people you care about... I was a happy person every single day until I realized that the future was rushing towards me. I am a skydiver. Sure you're supposed to enjoy the freefall, but it's all gotta end. I'll hit the ground, stare back up at the sky, and wish I could go back there. This October, I'll be a legal adult. A hell of a lot will have changed.... more than you readers might understand right now. Senior year: just another rush of air to plummet through. I don't really have that much time left. I guess I'd better deploy my parachute.      Hmmm, I feel better after having said all that I guess. I guess I'll take my own advice and try and enjoy this week off from school.   Try.   Love, it seems like only yesterday you were just a child at play Now you're all grown up, and silently Oh how fast those moments flee Once we watched a lazy world go by Now the days seem to fly Life is brief But when it's gone Love goes on and on
