As an end-of-the-year special, here are some of the best quotes of the year:  "Everyone thought he was going to die a hundred times." – Mr. Vignone  "I don't know if it's a custom to live with your husband's brother when you die." – Mr. Blanchet  "I want your eyeballs and your earballs on this 500 percent!" – Mr. Vignone  "He is married to Draupadi, but he's not Draupadi's son." – Mr. Blanchet  "A third is clergy, a third is nobility, but TWO thirds is the bourgeoisie." – Mr. Vignone  "This is not Mr. B's hizzouse of babysitting." – Mr. Blanchet  "It gives you license to whack!" – Ms. Craig-Olins  "Where the hell is Spain?" – Jacob Fleming  "Mentor is sometimes Mentor, but mostly he's Athena." – Ms. Craig-Olins  "The bull of 1296 was aimed at Henry....Philip merely sneered at this bull." – History Textbook   And now, the memorable dialogues:  Mr. Vignone (theoretically): Loren, during World War Two, who did the Nazis sign a non-aggression pact with?  Loren (theoretically): Presumably someone much shorter!  ---  Mr Vignone: Do you know the dilemma he's caught in?  Stephanie: Yeah, between liberty and freedom.  ----  Ms. Craig-Olins: What season is that?  C-Block: May.
