The Sun is a mass of incandesant gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace, where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees.  The sun is hot the sun is not a  place where we could live.  But here on earth there'd be no life without the light it gives.  We need its light, we need its heat, the sunlight that we see, the sunlight comes from our own sun's atomic energy. The Sun is a mass of incandesant gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace, where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees.  The sun is hot (The sun is so hot that everything on it is a gas. Aluminum, copper, iron, and many others). The sun is large (if the sun were large, a million earths would fit inside.  And yet, it is only a middle-sized star).  The sun is far away (About 93 million miles away, and thats why it looks so small!)  But even when its out of sight, the sun shines night and day.  We need its light, we need its heat, the sunlight that we see, the sunlight comes from our own sun's atomic energy.  Scientist have found the sun is a huge atom-smashing machine.  The heat and light of it are caused by the nuclear reactions between Hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, and helium.  The Sun is a mass of incandesant gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace, where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees.  SING IT, FOOLS!
