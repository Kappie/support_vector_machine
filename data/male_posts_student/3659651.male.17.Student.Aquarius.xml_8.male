Below are many photographs of the weekend. There are many more at http://flickr.com/photos/andrew_/. I did not post a certain picture here, because Dad didnt want me to spill the beans... about why the beans tasted so good! Everything else tasted really good, and not because it was spilled all over the floor (oops! sorry Dad), and I hope everyone had as much to eat, and as much fun, as I did.  At this moment there are stacks of clothes and a few other piles of things assembled upstairs in the computer/school room. Things are coming together, but there's a lot more to do to be ready for Friday. And its still just beginning to dawn on me that I will soon be in Sch√∂nstatt. Everyone being here at our house made me realize more than ever that home is with the people you love and are related to. So going to Schoenstatt will be the biggest homecoming of my life. So right now the main part I'm worried about is getting from Frankfurt to Koblenz, and then being sure that I have enough underwear and Advil to last a year!!!
