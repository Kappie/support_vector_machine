The prof is German (what is it with me and foreign teachers? - first it's the African teaching Spanish, now a German!), and he seems like he's pretty hard-nosed about things (i.e. a lot of homework, reading, etc.), so I don't think I'm going to get any of the this-is-the-last-class-I-need-to-graduate breaks :P.  But I was surprised with how much of it came back; of course, it's only been five months since I took my last Spanish class and I wasn't very good with it to be begin with.  Aside from that, I've got an interesting dilemma for my summer internship.  Right now I've gotten offers to do an internship with the Cuyahoga County (Cleveland) Public Defender and the Akron Prosecutor's Offie.  Considering that I'm not sure which side of criminal law I'm going to go into, this is quite a bind, especially since Akron is closer and it would minimize my overhead costs (i.e. gas, etc.) to work there.  But on the other hand, I might be able to do a lot of the same stuff I did in DC for the Cleveland PD (i.e. crime scene investigation, witness testimonies, etc.), and that would be awesome! :)  So I'm going to just see how this all pans out...
