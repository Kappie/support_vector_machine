She comes over to the register to take my money.  She takes my $10, gives me back my change.  Still wearing the gloves.  Isn't the point of the gloves so that what touches dirty stuff like money doesn't touch the food?  Why bother wearing gloves if you're gonna get them dirty?  Right?  And doesn't it sound dirtier to make a sandwich wearing dirty gloves than with dirty hands?  I mean, it's probablty the same either way, but something feels even less sanitary about dirty plastic gloves than dirty skin.  I don't know.  The sandwich was good, and I'm still alive, so I guess no big deal.  But still...
