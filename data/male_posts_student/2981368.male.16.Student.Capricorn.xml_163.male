I did a bit of shopping for Peru and purchased myself a rather fetching Aussi-style wide brimmed hat (without the corks)   Ben, that sucks about your mum - hope shes ok  i've spent most of the afternoon wondering how sumone could get enough speed to even dent your fence in this road  anyhoo  Sayonara
