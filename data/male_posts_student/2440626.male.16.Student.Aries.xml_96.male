But I am having a pretty good time, all things considered.  I hate to make this post so short, but I have to cut the frickin' grass on top of all of this.  I'll be at the fair tomorrow night from 6-11.  Kel too.  Stop out.   By the way, I would just like to congratulate Kel on the bottle punt in the Dumpster Olympics.  Also, a congratulations goes to Jessica Tandy for just being so darn precious!
