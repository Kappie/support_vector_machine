Now, it is today's download of the day, and also, today's tip.    The cool thing about Avant Browser is that it is a tabbed browser, with a powerful popup blocking device that will let pretty much NOTHING through.  Not as good as Mozilla's popup blocker on Firefox, but, it's still a lot better than getting a lot of popups.    The one thing I don't like about it is the fact that it can be so freakin' slow sometimes.  It runs on Internet Explorer technology, so you have to expect a little bit of slowdown, since it is not as powerful as Netscape's technology, for example.    Like I said, Avant Browser is a tabbed browser, and the tabs show up at the bottom of the screen, unlike Mozilla's, which go at the top.  I personally prefer them to be at the top, but, you can change them in Avant.  It has a nice interface, along with it, and downloadable skins are available, however, they don't look as good as Mozilla.  So, aside from being a little slow at times, Avant Browser is the perfect choice for anyone who is having problems with Internet Explorer, and, if you're running Mozilla Firefox, it is the best way to play games, since Mozilla requires you to download a special extension for games and things.   Pros  +Tabbed Browser +Pop Up Blocker +Nice interface   Cons  -Pop Ups may sneak through -Runs on Internet Explorer, so it is slow, unless you have a fast connection.
