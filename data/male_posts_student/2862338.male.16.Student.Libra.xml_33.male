I woke up about 6 am cause my cats wanted me to give em' food, but i juss didn;t comply, i mean, maybe if they looked like  urlLink this  i would help em' out, but instead, they look more like  urlLink this.  so, yea... anyway, i woke up real sick (which i still am) so i wasn't really HAPPY to get up.  I stayed in bed until 930, until my parents woke up and told me to get dressed.  U see, today was my lil' bro's baptism.  Now, usually at these events, there are alot of people there, (my dad was baptized,confirmed, had his first communion, and got married all on the same day) but at my lil bros...only 8,  me, my dad, my lil bro, his 2 god-prents, and their 3 kids. well, ya, wasn;t exactly a sell out crowd.  Well, we got there around 11:40, like we were suppose to, cause the ceremony was at 10. Well, the preist was late, and we started around 12:25-30.  But ya, we got on with it, and it all went acording to plan, BUT  urlLink A MIRACLE  (in my eyes) happened.  Because we started late, and all that junk, other people that usually go to that church started to show up, it was awsome, i think this white family came in first, with this dude that looked EXACTLY like  urlLink Bono  from  urlLink U2.  SO yeah, and then some spanish people started coming in for another baptism though, adn stuff, and by the end, the house of god was SOLD OUT BABY! wooo!! well, ya, it was crazy.  After that we went to go eat at "Flames" in Briacwiff.  Nice resturant, pretty upscale though, by the end of the day, we ended up paying a $400 bill...for food.  THe most i have EVER spent at a resturant, and probably the last time i ever will. i mean, shit, the bill cost more than my fucking car! i could have bought, a horse or something....or maybe even  urlLink this thing. but, what can i say...it was pretty damn good food.  After that, my parents decided they wanted to go see a movie, BUT i still had my suit on, so i felt like a dick, but we still went.  And after a 20 minuted discussion on what we were gonna see, we ended up seeing 50 First dates. (but since we bought the tickets pretty late, we didn't see the previews...DAMMIT) Here's The review:    50 First Dates     Ya, i definitly DIDN;t wanna see this movie...it looked dumb..BUT it's not bad, but it;s just not the kind of movie you wanna see with your parents, it;s more for like coples and shit.  THe movie revolves around Adam sandler....i forget what his name in the movie is....we'll juss call him adam.  Anyway, from the beggining of the movie, you know he's a MAJOR player, and he knows how to treat a girl...but thats it, u don't really get anymore info than that.  Well, ya, they go through some scenes and shit, but thats basically it.  Anyway, u find out he works at this aquarium as a vet.  Rob shnider is his hawaiin freind with like 6 kids who follow him every where.  So ya, it all good and stuff, and that guives the movie the excuse to use the cute animals.  Anyway, u also find out adam;s dream is to go to alaska in his boat, the  "sea Serpent" which is what he calls a toy car stuck in his ass. (not really) Well, ya, he ends up trying it, sucks, and has t call in the coast guard.  While he's wating, he goes into this resturant, and in comes to FAT ASS hawaiins.  There not important, thats where he meets drew barrymore's chracter lucy.  Everything goes on awsome, they hit it off GREAT, and blah blah blah, cues all the couple in the audince to hold hands and shit..ANYWAY, she invites him tomarrow to the same place.  He goes, blahb blah blah, then the FAT ASS hawain chik tells him that she has SHORT TERM MEMORY.  So there we go, i thinks thats all i have to say, the movie then continues on, him trying to get her to fall in love with him dozens of more times, until, at the end, they find out how he can make the relationship work.  I skipping over alot of stuff, but thats only cause if u wanna see it, i dun wanna ruin it for ya, its a pretty sweet movie, but like i said, u dun wanna go see it with your best buds...or your mom, dad, and lil bro.  So outa 5, i give this movie a 3...the animals, drew barrymore, and juss the whole "winning the girl" thing at the end was awsome...if i didn;t have Plastic surgery, i prolly would have shed a tear....or let go of a fart...either one so ya, there ya go, pretty nuts stuff.  After that i came back to ossining, went to carvel  urlLink breifly  then went home....i got home REAL tired, but when i got here,  ti was JUSS 6, so i went online juss to see if anything was going to go down tonight, aprrently nothing was, but the bright lasers that come out of my screen filled up my eye balls juss enugh to keep me awake to blog it up. spent some time after that juss checkin sites and shit (not porn) and sent dave some more pics for the gallery...i got some more i've neever seen of myself...and HOLY SHIT...let;s juss say THINGS HAVE CHANGED. WEll, ya, check out the  urlLink gallery  if you wanna see em' i guess.  OOOOO, did i forget to mention today is VALENTINES DAY?!?!? well, ya, it is, and ya, i had no date, but wtf, i was with the people i love the whole time.....now obviously i can;t make out with them, but they did buy me something! w00t!  i win! so yeah, tomarrow is jorge's B-day, so ONCE again, happy b-day to him.  He said he can either go with us, or his antioch freinds.  Antiock is basically a fun-church.  THey do alot of gay things, but the fun stuff they do definitly out wieghs that.  I was the first one Rob approched to join, and i was enthusiastic, but then, i chickend out, and ended up not going.  So jorge in hernie got in after that, and well, the rest is history.  But ya, if i think it;s gonna turn out how i think it is....He's prolly gonna go to dave and busters with his antioch freinds,and the rest of us will go to X-zone.  Well, juss gonna have to go see how it turns out i guess, until next time, keep yourself busy with something.
