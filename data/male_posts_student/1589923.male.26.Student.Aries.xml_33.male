It's a good thing that i was doing my assignments last nite till 4 in the morning. It pushed me to the limit and drains me both physically and mentally before i called it. In a way, i managed to get things done and logically speaking i should be satisfied about it. But i m not. Nothing seems to perk me up even tho for the fact that i managed to breeze through the lab test this time round.   What can i do to make me feel better about myself? instead of seeing myself in such ways? it is often said, that it's how u look one thing and form an impression of it. Basically it's the, "half-empty or half-filled" glass saying. Seriously, i think all this while, i have been putting myself down too much. So much to the extent, it became in-bred in me. It develops a life of its own, manipulating my conscious and mind. I feel crappy more than joy. It sucks totally. I go on in life as per normal. Ppl will not know that i feel shite about myself coz i know how sucky it is to look gloomy in a group. It's contagious and ppl do not like that. So i be my casual self. Take it as things go but deep inside. I'm suffering deeply, bruised and battered like a broken soul.
