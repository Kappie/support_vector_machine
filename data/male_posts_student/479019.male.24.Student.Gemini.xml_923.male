I saw School of Rock already and it was really fun, I started The Triplets, but I dozed off due to some insomnia last night. I’m going to finish it later.  I also decided to check out some books for pleasure reading. I checked out  Joy Luck Club  and  Catch 22 . I’m about ¼ the way through Joy Luck Club and so far it’s really got me in a Mother’s Day mood. Not only because it deals with mothers, but because of all the little Chinese-y things in it. There are just so many little things in it that sort of remind me of my own identity. I believe I said something along these lines to Melissa the other day, my “whitewashness” isn’t about ignoring or not knowing about my heritage… it’s about no trying to a stereotyped kind of Asian. I am myself, and I’m not someone who drives a rice rocket or listens to hip-hop or raves.  Something else…. I just want a certain friend to know that all her good qualities are plentiful and outweigh anything negative she, myself, or other people might point out.   4 more days until I’m back in Irvine!   ***
