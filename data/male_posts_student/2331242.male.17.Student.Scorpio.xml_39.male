My dad wants to drive up to Virginia   again   to ride what's called "The Creeper." It's a bike trail that's mostly downhill. It's fun and all, I've done it before, but dammit I just spent over 12 hours in the car checking out colleges! I don't wanna drive right back where I was yesterday.  Martha's gonna try and call me late tonight. I hope she can.
