While reading  John Kerry on the Issues  on his personal website, I came across something that is very disturbing.  Let me quote John Kerry's stances on the issues:  John Kerry on the Issues   Economy:  "John Kerry has the courage to roll back Bush’s tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans so we can invest in education and healthcare."   College Affordability:  "While George Bush gives tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans..."  "John Kerry has the courage to take on Bush’s tax cuts for the wealthy so we can invest in education."   Education:  "John Kerry believes that we need to invest in our schools instead of giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans."   Health Care:  "George Bush has chosen to lavish tax cuts upon the wealthiest..."   Homeland Security:  "John Kerry has the courage to roll back George Bush’s tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans so we can invest in homeland security."   National Service:  "Whether it is protecting America from the threats of terrorism or addressing the problems we have at home, America's new challenges will not be met by the same old answers of big government or big tax cuts for the wealthy."  Kerry's vision? The only one that I can see is a promise to raise our taxes and take money out of the pockets of the middle class, working Americans.
