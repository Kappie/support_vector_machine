Mostly walking to and from the dam, to and from the rec hall, and playing cards, or video games when my cousins ditched me from time to time. It wasn't in a mean way, they just never made an effort to find me before they went and did stuff, and when I found them later in the day, they're all "Where've you been?" In my freaking cabin, if you cared to look. sheesh. oh well. Some are coming to Jekyll and Hyde.  Haha, tricked you, I'm a hippie.
