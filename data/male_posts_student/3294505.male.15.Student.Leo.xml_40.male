And getting a couple new pictures I drew up scanned, at that. We cracked some jokes, played some games, and I was on my merry way. Almost immediately after changing into my houseclothes with plans of staying home and not sweating anymore, an old friend of mine and a newer one both come to my door, and we skate and bike around town for a while. Man, what a good day. I'm so exhausted, though. It's so fucking hot.    But it's cool, eventually I'm gonna find more reasons to hang out and stuff. To my surprise, there were actually no hot chicks out today. Maybe that's just cause we hung around a different part of town. I bet if the three of us had gone to Stop N Shop we woulda been seeing some hot chicks.       Hmm.
