On the last day of my stay in Sweden I met up with  Rebecca and her hot friend  at an amuesment park: Liseberg. Had shit loads of fun and got pics with it. We ate at a  Eat all You want for 70kr  restauraunt.  GOD DAMN I WAS FULL  after just 2 slices of Pizza. Then we decided to queue up for about 40 minutes just to ride this roller coaster called  Balder ; it was alright. Then snice we were tired we went on a 3D cinema show; where  we were given glasses that look like my mums  haha. During the day we rode many rides! When we got back me and Niklas finished a  whole crate of beer  during the night and watched Camp Jim while cracking up to that gay show. Oh and  his parents walked into the house piss drunk ; after having  drunken shit loads  at the neigbours house!    Robin and the hot girl Rebecca brought with her. And her brother.   The resauraunt where i only ate 2 slices.   After winning an ugly monkey.  	 On the wildest ride ever. Literally. I thought it was damn good, but I won't ever show you the pic of the ride; its embarassing!  	 Oh shit! Pretend you never saw that!   Cool dudes.  	 Rebecca about the leave.   Niklas on the way home.  	 Niklas being a fag and taking photos of himself.   Preparing to drink a crate of beer, after already having 5 cans. ( hence the red eyes )
