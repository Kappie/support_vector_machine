I look back on the arrogant ideals I and others think, how we believe we are "masters of our own domain" or "controllers of our own eternal destinies."  How foolish can we be!!!!!!!!  We want to use universal practices that work in the marketplace and attribute those to the church.  At a recent meeting on ways of expanding our church attendance, I suggested Ladies Night, hey It works for the bars why not for churches?  If you bring the ladies the guys will follow, ain't I right?  Of course, this is silly, church is something truly unique, church  SHOULD be the place where Christ is found.  The description I heard which I agree with, is the church is not an organization but an organism.  The church is God's main tool in bringing about the changes in this world he desires.  I guess I am "high church" in that I want the church to aspire to high, eternal values.  There is no lack of hatred, bigotry, and arrogance in the world today, do we as believers really need to contribute to that?  I have not heard anybody yet say there is too much grace, mercy and compassion in this world.  I pray we as the body of Christ will be forerunners in dispensing God's grace, love and mercy.  Indeed, we need to go into the dark chasms of sinful man to freely give the light of Christ as we have freely received it.  I pray we carry the attitude of Christ, who was (and is) very convinced of the severity of one's sin but was (and is) as equally convinced of God's love for the sinner.  Well, I wanted this to be light-hearted as in a jovial manner but perhaps, Lord willing, it will instead a better kind of light-heartedness in which it illuminate peoples heart to share God's love.  If this is not as deep and profound as I want it to be, I will go back to wise-cracks and one-liners at Church Growth meetings, I do not think the world needs anymore of those either!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   12 We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. 13 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. 14 The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. 15 The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgment:    1CO 2:16 "For who has known the mind of the Lord     that he may instruct him?"  But we have the mind of Christ.
