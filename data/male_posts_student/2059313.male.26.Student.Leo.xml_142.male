I need friends that I can just sit back and relax with every once in a while.  I love going out and doing things, but I’m a very high-strung kind of person, and I need to really break myself out of that, it’s not a big “turn-on” for too many people.  I really need to find people I can just sit back, shoot the bull, have a drink, and hang out with.  Where are you?   11:56am  I had a wonderful dream last night.  I usually have really weird dreams that I remember or seemingly abstract or something absurd that is a reflection on what’s going on in my mind at the time… and this could be one of those dreams.  But it was very straight forward.  I had sex with this girl.  It was very passionate… I don’t remember if I knew her or not (in real life), or if she was just some amalgamation of my subconscious.  It was one of the best dreams I can remember having, and as I was in that fog moving from sleep to awake, I remember having this feeling of closeness with someone.  Then as I came out of the fog I looked next to me… guess who was there!?  No one.  Not saying that I want to have sex right now or anything… just that I’d like to be with someone who cares as much about me as I do her.  I know I have friends, and one really great one in particular, but I can’t get what I feel I need from them.  Friendship goes a long way, and I believe that all relationships should try to build that first before making it anything else, but I guess I just want more of an intimacy with someone than I feel I can get from a friend… or am getting from friends.  I don’t even mean in a physical sense, I don’t know, it’s a very abstract thing I’m trying to describe, but I can tell that it’s there and there’s a desire for something MORE.  Well, until then…  Sex dreams are the next best thing to actually doing it.
