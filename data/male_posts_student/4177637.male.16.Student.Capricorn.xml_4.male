Most of the ones I'm about to post here are from a trip to a waterpark somewhere in the southern/middle portion of Taiwan, which was the only time I left Taipei during the summer (except of course, to go to Japan). The two people with me are the college students that pretty much took me around and kept me company since I can't read the language and probably would have gotten myself killed had I tried to wander around on my own, plus it would have been extremely boring without company around my age. (You'd think I was still in school with that South Aiken shirt and the bookbag).   urlLink http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v425/Spets1/PICT0477.jpg    urlLink http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v425/Spets1/PICT0504.jpg  This was after a very wet ride (not a sexual innuendo -_-)   urlLink http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v425/Spets1/PICT0467.jpg
