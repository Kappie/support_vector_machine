Now, something we all do when we have a new relationship, normally on the first or second meeting is watch a film, I know its a bit of a wuss out option but we all do it, its easy and we don’t have to worry about making conversation etc etc, also it allows us to do other things if everything’s going well... you know what I’m saying lol. Yep, films are great alright, but when it comes to choosing the actual movie you are going to watch with her/him I think its a very precise art, and when you think about it there’s actually very specific criteria for you to make your choice with. Firstly, you want a comedy, this lightens the mood and makes everyone feel good, generally better about themselves, it also means that the two of you share some laughter, this is a very positive experience, and when you both find something funny it bonds you a little. Also, it will get you both smiling, everyone looks better when they are smiling. Next, and here’s the difficult part, you also want it to have some scary bits in there, this especially applies if your date is a girl, I’m not being sexist but if there’s a bit of gore or something slightly unpleasant her natural instinct is to lean into you for protection etc, we all know how great this is. Finally, the film just needs to be plain good quality, this shows that you have really good taste and can make good decisions etc etc. I think if you follow these rules the two of you will definitely be closer by the end of the movie, literally lol. There really is no better way to get closer to someone you like, and remember, the smaller the sofa the better and make sure its big and squishy. Anyway, bearing all of the above in mind, the best date movie I have found so far is.... The reasonably low budget Brit comedy 'Shaun of the Dead', its worked for me, ill let you read about it for yourselves:  urlLink http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/
