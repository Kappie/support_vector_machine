Now that the Holidays are over and Sam has returned up to the frozen north of Kalamazoo, its time for me to continue my online rantings because I no longer have a life and I have quite a bit of free time on my hands now.  So what am I up to now?  Well, today was my first day of my Nursing Assistant classes at the old folks home.  Today I did a lot of paperwork and watched a few videos on blood-born pathogens and the new (kinda) HIPAA rules etc.  What does this mean?  No names or places will be included in my blog, as the government, school, and institution can fuck me big time if I say anything.  Privacy is all important in this age of the "Freedom Act" am I right?  HIPAA?  More like HIPAA-critical!  Zing!  Besides, I like old people.  Hopefully I can become one of them some day, and I wouldn't want everyone else knowing that I pooped my pants on a regular basis.  But the first day was fun.  There is only one other male in my class with 10 girls/women/people with vaginas.  Clinicals start next Tuesday and we get to feed the old folks.  Sounds like a blast!  No really, Im kinda excited.  I just have to get over the fact that I will be shoving food in someone else's face.  Maybe I should practice on Tony...  muwahahahahahahahaaaaaa!  (evil laugh)  So what have I been up to lately?  This weekend was Erin and Tom's wedding which was a blast.  Fun times were had by all (except Joanna's date, but he's getting dumped this week anyways.)  But I wish it could have gone on longer and I could have gotten drunker.  Especially with the entire Lyons Township administrative staff and many teachers whom I have previously had, watching me get blitzed and look like a fool on the dance floor.  Oh well. Good times.  Pictures are up.  Still trying to get the hang of the camera.  For some reason, the Ai focus sucks and focuses on the wrong things.  Gonna have to figure that out better.  Oh well.    TKD tonight, may test, but need to give Master Park a check. Then Bed, cause I have class in the AM.    Rock.  (as stolen from Bill 'cause Im unoriginal)
