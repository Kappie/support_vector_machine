You know the feeling... where you all of the sudden realize that... well, it's hard to put it into words, because it's a thousand different feelings at once.     Imagine... imagine you're walking, down a street, or browsing in Blockbuster or something... and then you accidentally catch a glimpse of yourself in a mirror or something, and can't help but stop to look. You look at it and just get this wierd feeling, it shocks you and says "This is you. You are an insignificant speck in the world around you, billions of different people are on their own trivial agendas, and, surrounded by this, is you."     I'm not saying i'm having a depression streak, far from it. I feel anything but sad.     I don't remember if i've written about this before(even if i had, it needs to be said again), but stop and take a look at yourself right now. You're sitting in your chair, slouching, staring at your computer screen at this blinding white page, maybe with some music on, and chatting with people on the side.      There are, at any given time, a couple hundred million doing basically the same thing. And there are the others sleeping, or eating, or putting clothes in their dresser, rehearsing for a band, singing, watching TV, exercising, at school, at a party, bored out of their minds, brushing their teeth, shaving, washing dishes, taking out the trash, scrubbing floors, working a cash register, putting together little plastic toy tea-pots, weaving wicker baskets, putting bits of exploded goat into little pots, harvesting moon rocks in New Jersey, making a pancake that can run for president, throwing water at the poor monkey that had no money to pay rent for his bedroom that happened to be in the bathroom of Starbucks and asked a rich cow for money but she made him paint her feet but he missed and painted her legs so she got angry and now he lives in the street being very sad while getting water thrown at him.... but that's besides the point.  The point is that there are a gabilzilmilion things going on at any given time behind your back, and you, and I are oblivious to it.  I love to weave wicker baskets.
