I had to go to school yesterday for some crappy award ceremony where I got like 4 awards. But its summer vacation, so I'm not going back to that hell hole for a LONG time.  I'm going to leave for Virginia on July 5th, so I'll be posting from another state that night. Believe me... There will be NO shortage of stories for me to post while I'm there. After all, I'm going to be in Richmond, which is certainly more active than a farming community.
