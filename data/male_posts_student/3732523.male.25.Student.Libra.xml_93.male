Oooh, Lions! Rrrroooooooooooaaaaaarrrrrr! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! I want a penguin! "  No I've not gone mad, this was the the child's side of a conversation with his mother in London Zoo yesterday . I guess, like Russ, he too was particularly taken with penguins, so much so that even a lion couldn't stem his demands. So, as I'm sure you've guessed, I was at London Zoo yesterday along with Star and Millymollymandy. As my pre-birthday treat, I was allowed to choose where we went for the day, so we all stumped up 13 quid (EEP!) to get in and wander round the zoo for 4-5 hours. As zoo's go it was ok, although I thought there would be a lot more animals there. The giraffes as always were impressive and I got to see plenty of monkeys including the little redheaded baby Francois langur that prompted "Ginger Sunday" last weekend - where over 1000 redheads got 2 for 1 entry to the zoo!  The meercats were cute and I still can't get over how small they are. Millymollymandy insisted on calling them all "Phil" after the TCZ character who did a meercat impression in one of the Bristol meet videos - and so when she called "Phil" at the meercat enclosure she was quite happy when one of them actually looked over. The penguins were cool (literally!) and unlike the child I now have a penguin (in the form of a money box and a new keyring to replace my rather delapidated lego-man keyring). I was very tempted to go up to the child when we saw him later and say "I got a penguin! I got a penguin! I got a penguin! I got a penguin! I got a penguin! I got a penguin!"....but I couldn't be that evil, could I?  ;)  Next stop on the London sightseeing is a "flight" on the London Eye with Monster on Friday :)  I can't wait!!
