I'm putting it up to you to vote (via the comment section) who would be better to play me.   1.   urlLink Ron Howard   (younger - more like Richie Cunningham age)   2.   urlLink Seth Green   (as cast by my good friend, Stephanie)   3.   urlLink Clay Aiken   (also, if my movie became a musical, he could play me then, too)
