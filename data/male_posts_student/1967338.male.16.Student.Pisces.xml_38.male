I don't think they're the best I've written ever...so...please...be nice.  "Change Over Time"  My 7th Grade Teacher's Favorite phrase used to seem Absurd, abstract.  But now I see, That behind the times, there really has been Change Over Time.  Once the world was dead, dark, desolate, but by dawn there came lights.  Light from the sun, Light from man's brilliance. But these lights Couldn't be relied upon.  So we're ever-searching, ever-wondering: What prompted this Change Over Time?  ~*~ (Insert Title Here…possibly “A Moment”)  The sun rises over a dying cornfield.  Crows take flight awakened by the sudden, blinding light.  Their world has changed in an instant.  One moment forever altering their future.   So, as I said, not the best I’ve ever written.  I think my time when poetry was easy for me is over.  Now I have to work for it.  So this is just the first draft.  Yep.  So please tell me! SQEE!
