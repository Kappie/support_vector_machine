At the track, like... the whole team was there doing stuff, but it wasn't a meet. The weird thing was, Jeff was there(O_o). I was running, but it was so slow. It seemed no matter how hard I pushed, I couldn't get any faster, at least, my normal speed, which isn't even that fast with which to begin (>_ _It was hot last night. I actually went to bed at a decent hour (oh, say... 1-ish), but it was so frickin' hot that I had to open my sliding glass door. Even then, it was still burning in those blankets. I didn't actually sleep straight until about 3 AM. I wasn't expecting it to be so hot, so I did a lil workout before bed and that made it even worse. Uguu~. If there was one inefficiency in humans that artificial replicants lack, it's the need for long periods of unconsciousness. I've said it a million times, and I'll say it again, "If sleep weren't so damned comfortable, I wouldn't do it." But sleep... it gets in the way of things, productivity, activity, learning, working, fun. I could do without it. If there were some scientific way of getting around sleep and still leading a healthy, normal life I'd take it. If humans could have evolved out of sleep, we would've ruled the world a long long time ago. We're talking, BAM! No resistance. And one is always so prone in his or her sleep. It's just inviting for some nasty parasite to attack like a spider or mosquitoes. Without sleep, people could have more time to relax and truly enjoy it, because... who consciously enjoys sleep while they're sleeping? no one, that's why they call it "unconscious." Sleep tricks you though. While your body is paralyzed, it creates a dream world for you, a Matrix of sorts. Sure, it can be entertaining at times, but most of the time, I don't even remember it. And the dream is conveniently accelerated, so that it seems as if hardly any time has passed. One has absolutely no control over sleep, at least, not total control, and that's what humans like, right? control. That's all we've ever taken strides for, control over the land, the seas, the sky, space, the elements. Of course, there are abstract things over which we have no control, like time, but sleep is a thing. Sleep is something that can be monitored in a controlled system, something that can be counted and varies, is multidirectional. If someone could develop a way around sleep, he/she would be a very successful man/woman. I suppose there would be downsides to eschewing sleep. There might be longer work hours, etc. but think of the progress we could make. And if the process were artificially imposed anyway, a person would have a choice. Eh, well, that's enough of that. _Man, I just can't believe it. In August, our senior year begins. college applications, testing, more testing, studying, sports, academic league, long goodbyes, responsibility. It's kind of a big step. I wonder just how much I'll change over the next year. Hopefully, I won't get any uglier or less attractive (XP). Hopefully, this year will be more fruitful and full of happy news, although I know Fate doesn't work that way. I'm guessing my school week will be as follows: -Monday: Been up all night studying, breakfast, class, class, talk, class, class, lunch @ NCAL or homework, class, class, something afterschool like tutorial, get home, study and hw, eat maybe, anime?(if there's time), maybe workout while I watch anime, hw, study, sleep(?) -Tuesday: barely awake, school early, quick breakfast, class, talk, class, lunch @ NCAL or with hw, again, class, afterschool tutorial, eventually sports, home, nap?, hw hw hw, eat, workout, hw, sleep(?) -Wednesday-Friday: lather, rinse, repeat. -Saturday: Usually something, like family get-together, if not volunteer work, hw hw hw hw hw, eat and sleep. college stuffs. -Sunday: volunteer if not on Saturday, hw hw hw hw hw hw. .... Sounds fun, ne? well, that'll just have to be how it is for a while. And if Jay and I start a club (if it's not too late to already XP), I'll be even busier, hooray! but to some extent, I do like being kept busy. Summer like this is so .... not what I would want it to be. you know? okay, time to go shopping at Target. bye!
