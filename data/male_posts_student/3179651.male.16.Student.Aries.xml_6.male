I think some other people might come, and then we will leave earlier and go to eat, then mia may head of to the LHS prom. Next Saturday is ring dance. ALl the guys are going to be jealous of me haha. I have the biggest boobed senior! Everyone wants her... LOL. She even has multiple prom dates. Partying like mad afterwards. Then hopefully shopping... Ahh, finally some damn color back in my life
