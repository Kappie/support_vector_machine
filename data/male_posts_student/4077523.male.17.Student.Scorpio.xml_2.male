I am just writing this now because I am bored and there really isn't much else to do. I might do a bit of surfing and stuff before I leave this job today. More than likely I will be doing this again next summer. What is it that I do you ask? Nothing, haha, I just get to sit here and make minimum wage for doin nothing. I think I have worked a total of 4 hours this whole summer and get paid for an 8 hour a day job. Well anyway, i'm gonna go and surf some more so I will probably post later. Peace!
