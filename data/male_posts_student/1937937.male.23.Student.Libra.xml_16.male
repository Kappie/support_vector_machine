There were about 2,500 of us staying in the hotel, and several hundred others flocking in from the Orlando area.  We stayed up all night for several days straight, we consumed thousands of gallons of Red Bull, we smoked many, many cigarettes.  Only at ICYPAA do you find a drum circle in the Peabody lobby at 3am.  I spoke to a hotel employee, who said, "Yes, we sometimes get crazy groups here.  I've never seen a drum circle in the lobby, especially not at 3 in the morning."  I stayed with Carissa, Adi, Carl, Sara, Natalie, and Rita.  Most of Miami was there.  I'm still really burned out.
