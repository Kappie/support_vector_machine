Here's my homework for Monday: reread a chapter, read a confusing thing about French grammar, do 4 French exercises, do flash cards for 15 French words, study 30 French words, write a biography on Achilles, locate and analyse a passage on him in an essay, write a long essay about the Crusades, study for a test about the High Middle Ages, study for a long vocabulary test, and study for a "quest" on chapter 4 (math)! I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Aaaaaa!  The book I checked out from the North library, "The Next 500 Years" is tres gouda; it gives the audience what it wants: tangents and lots of them.  In English, my summary of one of the books of "The Odyssey" had an appositive in practically every sentence (if you don't know what this is, I'll tell you: an appositive is YOU'RE STUPID!!!). This led Loren to exemplify: "Odysseus, being a man, walked over there. Athena, seeing him walk over there, also walked over there." Later, Ms. Craig-Olins said that Athena made Odysseus look like a god, so Loren wrote in his notes, "Odysseus = god).  I'll leave you with the following quote from a video:  "To the Europeans, the world looked like this, with Europe to the lower left. To the Muslims, the world looked like this, with Asia slightly larger than Europe. To the Chinese, the world was China."
