I fell asleep in the car and was probably better off asleep because of motion sickness. We arrived in the town and parket the car beside the beach and walked along to a couple of cafés and Aqualud, which is a small water park on the beachside.   We had a few drinks while Ryan and Grandad went in and walked around for a little while. When they came out of the water park we went back to Calais and to the hotel in time for a swim in the hotel pool and the news. Clouds were appearing from all directions and by the time we were back in the hotel room the sky was covered. No sooner had the BBC South East news discussed the abnormal weather (and marble sized hail that had been at Dover) the thunder outside had begun.   Sheet and fork lightning form all directions appeared followed by the loud rumbling and groaning from the clouds above. One bolt shot down and hit one of the metal poles in the Cité Europe shopping centre behind the hotel. It was a very rewarding experience! I managed to take well over 300 photographs on my memory card whilst frantically snapping up pictures of the sky to try and capture the lightning, but no such luck. If I had had my new camera with me it would have been possible to have taken a video of it... never mind.   The night went on and the thunder calmed down and we ate in the hotel restraunt for a change because we couldn't go out due to the car not having headlight converters. There wasn't much thunder after that, apart from an outbreak from Grandma in the hotel lobby.
