This isn't the first time its happened, either.  Every time I go to bed early, I'm incredibly tired.  Why must that happen?!  So, as soon as I get this post done, I'm calling it quits already for the night.   Today marks the last official day of summer.  Monday morning, the halls of The River High School will be flooded with new and returning students; students who can't find their ways around; students who have the intent of annoying the upperclassmen; upperclassmen who have the intent of annoying the new students; students who already wish summer was back...I'm sure you get the point.  It's going to feel weird, being at school again after this shockingly long summer break.  It feels like it was a year ago when I last walked through the halls.  This year is going to be very different indeed.  No bus rides, my brother will be there, I'm working in the front office instead of guidance this year, and all sorts of other things.  It's going to work though, except for the brother being there.  One day, and he'll be in trouble.  I know he will.   I don't think I mentioned me cutting my foot the other day...it didn't seem important.  I ran the back of my chair at my computer into it, and the wheelie thingy ripped skin off my foot.  It wasn't that bad when it happened.  But, now, it's gotten like 10x worse.  Oh well.  I have nothing better to talk about.  That's it for me for tonight.  Tomorrow is post-o-rama, as well as some upgrade work.  New template, anyone?  I'm thinking so.  It's about time, I think.  New poll, re-organization, and some other new things that I'm planning on adding in here.  I'm also going to start writing Digital Lust's new post tomorrow.  I'm taking a look at some of the templates, and, possibly, we'll be changing tomorrow.  But, we'll see.  So, until then, let me go to sleep, because I've got about 15 minutes before my eyes close and I'm out.  So, I'm spent (stole that from Courtney, if nobody caught on yet).  Adios for now.
