BUT OH WELL..wow caps were on...ya, so anyways. i had to take a (uh oh, gross word coming up) URINE test and stuff to check for ketones, and i had "trace 5" wich means that i have no body fat and my body IS eating away at my muscles as we speak. know what that means? it means i have to stop being lazy (crap!) and i have to start working out again...ugh. anyways im really hungry havnt eaten anything in over 12 hours. bye
