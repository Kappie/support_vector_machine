Are. Cool.  It's not sentence fragmentation, it's Cataloguing! ;-)  So....yeah.  I need something to do at coffee house. Maybe I'll write something. Maybe I'll just find something. Bah. Also I need to learn a song for tryouts. A good one.  So yeah. My mind is mush. And my face has more pockets than magician. duh
