Seems that the car I was looking at (an '04 Accent) suddenly increased in price from $6495 to $6995; they claim that the $6495 car has already been sold, and that as this was a special discount price, the next discounted '04 is going for $6995 (nonnegotiable).  I honestly don't know if this is true or not; my dad thinks that they are pulling a "bait-and-switch."  Of course, me being the naive, trusting person that I am...well, I want to believe them, and I honestly still think that it's an ok deal even at $6995.  Unfortunately, I'm trying to keep the total debt for this transaction below $7,000, so $6995 doesn't cut it (adding taxes and everything else brings the total to about $7500).  Grr...and I really liked that car.  Oh well...back to looking at mid-mileage Toyotas and whatnot.  GRRR....looks like I'm back to square one.
