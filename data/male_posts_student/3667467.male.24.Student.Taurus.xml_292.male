Last week I procrastinated so much I got a whole website working without reading one page of research material. This week is a big question mark, though I must say it is already 2 in the afternoon. In other Buffalo State news, I forgot to hand in my Application for Graduation, which means I technically won't be able to graduate until August. Not a problem, really, it just gives me more time to procrastinate out a better paper. But don't you hate missing deadlines?
