Everyone knows who they are, what their like and what their interests are by instinct, dont they? I know what iwant to do and what i aspire to be...this didnttake me a long time to work out,its like a jigsaw puzzle designed for 5 year olds. all you need is to take you into account while making these desisons. Some people go as far as treking to the top of a mountain to find out what they want and expect from life, to find their 'inner-being'.   Even if i did find this vertue what could i do with this information when weve only got 60-70 years to take it all into account. i suppose we could make the world a better place, but i belive that this takes a special kind of person to do this and not anyone can walk into this world with the perfect answers. One man who made the world a better place was Martin Luther King Jr. He came into this world with a leading attitude and i think that he did his duty well.  One thing that really ticks me off is Princess Diana, i know she may of done alot for us but compared to mother teressa she was a lay about. BUT mother teressa didnt recive such an elaborate memorial as Diana did. Princess Diana had a memorial made for her that cost in excess of 3.6million, Â£600,000 over budget. DO you think that she would of wanted the money to be spent on that instead of on the starving?  I should add i do like Claires Hair  Dave XxXxX
