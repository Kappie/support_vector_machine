We found out this kid Justin can sign us and get us popular and stuff. After practice my mom's long lasting friend and her son Chris came over. I haven't seen Chris in a while so I was excited. The kid's awesome, and he's got all these awesome things like the new Ngage cell phone and all these great Gamecube games. The whole time we just glued our eyes to the tv or computer screens, playing games and watching movies. Chris started playing this game on my computer I didn't even know I had. Then I started to play this game called Freedom Fighters which is "What happens if the Soviets won the Cold War?" Commies take over New York, you lead a resistance of revolutionaries to crush the Soviet Union. It really makes you love America and want to nuke Russia. After I think of it, America is a great country compared to every where else. Even though the government is all shaky and I'm always saying OH THE GOVERNMENT SUCKS, LAWS SUCK, THERE'S NO FREEDOM, WHY DO WE HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL, this and that. All the other countries are much harsher and now that I really think about it, I would be honored to fight for my country. Especially in an awesome situation in the game where Brooklyn and Manhattan have been taken over completely but here comes along you, with all this revenge in your blood, sniping all those commie bastards and torching them to see them run in flames regretting they ever stepped foot on American soil. There's this really anying commie female news reporter and I want to kill her even if she's just a bunch of codes on a gamecube disc. Anyways, that's basically it. Oh and I'm cutting down on all the bad stuff I'm always saying in here. People will start thinking I'm really a psycho, it's just that I like to talk meaningless crap to waste my time, mostly procrastination, I hate doing homework. As does everyone else. Something positive, Christmas, god I can't wait. It's definetly the best time of the year. Toilet Bowl. I'm making my dad a bday card with a picture of him, well it's a cartoon guy supposed to be him, on a statue thing, it's lame and horrible. Actually I'm going to change it, I hate making bday cards. Ok later everyone.
