Well that is how mine feels right now.  Here is how my Winter Break is going:  All last week was okay, I guess. Christmas was good. I got a lot of cool stuff, including a $50 gift card to Best Buy, which I used today. I also got a $20 gift card to Barnes and Noble from Greg the Goat (loooooooong story for another time). I also went ATVing. The picture of me with all the stuff is in the Pictures section. Other then that, my week went by slowly.  Now onto today:  Okay, so today I woke up about 9:45 and I couldn't breathe, so I sat up and I magically could breathe. Amazing how noses work, isn't it? So then I got up and took a shower. Then I called Stefani but I got the answering machine so I waited like 5 minutes and called her back. It was busy, so I was all UGH! BUSY! Lol. So then I hang up, and she calls right back. So we decide to hang out. She wants to use her Wal-Mart Gift Card (don't even get me started! I didn't buy anything - I'm morally against Wal-Mart. I will explain later if you want). OH! But before that we went to the bank so Stefani could get some money out then we went to Taco Bell. Stefani told me that I might get the job at Taco Bell! She saw her manager looking at my application. She also told me the shim isn't working. She thinks it either got fired or quit. Phew! Now I can work there and not worry about a thing looking at me, lol.   Then we called my mom and I wanted to go to Best Buy. So she comes and gets us and we go to Best Buy. I bought a computer game, which of course won't work on my F-ing computer! Donâ€™t ever buy an HP. They suck! I also bought two Dashboard Confessional CDs and the Clay Aiken CD. All are VERY good. Then we went to DSW and I saw these really cool shoes in the sales rack. They are goofy, but cool. They are brown and Rancho green. I think they are cool. If I get the job at Taco Bell I will go back and get them. Then we went to Barnes and Noble. I didn't find anything, so we went home. I stayed over at Stefani's for a bit and then went home.  My mom picks me up and tells me we are going to the office. I looked at her like WTF? And I asked why and she said because she got a really big bonus. I was like so I can get my car now? And she said no. UGH!  So that was my day. Now can you see why my life is like pushing a fat man off a cliff?  Until next time...
