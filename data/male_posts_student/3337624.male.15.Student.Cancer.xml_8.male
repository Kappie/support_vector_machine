We had to find all 7 words and then figure out the 8th word from letters from the first 7. We found the first 3 and figured the other 5 out easily. We then hid in the corn stalks and scared people. You should see them run. We had to take a few breaks for drinks. She tripped once when she was trying to scare someone. hehe. No one was hurt. Except me. when i laughed. I got her back by picking her up and running into the corn field. It must have looked weird seeing a 7 foot girl running through a corn field screaming. hehe. She got me a stuffed animal squirrel for my birthday, so i'm happy. Gonna see her again thursday:) We walked her dog this morning. I picked up rocks and thorugh them, and the dog tried to bring them back. I picked up this huge rock, the dog sniffed the hold the rock left when i picked it up, then looked up......right into the rock. Boy that must of hurt. Well gotta go play with squirrels
