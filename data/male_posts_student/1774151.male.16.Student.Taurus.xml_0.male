Maybe its the mono finally kicking in...if so...DIANNA U GOT IT....hahaha...maybe not. o well...  you know who i hate?  stupid fucks who ruin my chatterbox by saying stupid shit and not commenting on worthwhile stuff like affairs in politics and whos got a nice ass. Im sick of the bullshit like "omg this song was played live by so and so and its def not their best song u shud put a better song onBLA BLA bla bla bla........."  in a whiny voice of course. Lemme tell u something bitch we do whatever the hell we want here so just fuck off. And anyone else who wants to criticize me and john..they better just start playin the skin flute cuz it aint gonna make no difference.    by the way..go bush u caught saddam...saddam u shud be given trichomoniasis (thats the one with the green frothy discharge)....and dianna has a nice ass...thank you for flying 2over6 and have a nice day   FUCKER.
