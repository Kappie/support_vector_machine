I see my collection of assorted change sitting in a container and I think... I wonder how much I got.  So I start the funtabulous job of counting and rolling my change.  Now normally, this isn't a blog worthy story, but come on, I had like $25 in change!  That’s a lot of change.   So I plow through my container searching for the elusive "quarter". I feel like a gold prospector.  Shaking the "pan" until I hit pay dirt.  Then after a while I have an epiphany! I finally realize the reason I was put on this earth, the meaning of life, if you will.  Looking down at my change I realize that I'm here to start a movement, nay a  crusade , to remake the nickel.  I mean come on, what is this useless thing.  I don't know what it is this thing that I hate so much.  Maybe its the hippy-looking fella on the front or maybe its the disappointment I felt when I found out they were never really made out of wood.  Or  maybe its the lack of ridges that just makes it feel like one of those frikn' euro thingy majiggers, but it just seems like the nickel is the black sheep of the coin family.   And it seems like the nickel has lost its popular support.  In an informal Mr. X poll, a whopping 100% of those polled, said they hate the nickel and all it stands for. *   How long will the politicians in Washington ignore our cries for a revised nickel.  Wanting to be part of the solution, I have an idea for a new nickel.  We need to get rid of that hippy weirdo on the front.  I tried to think of another president to replace him, but I couldn't think on any that would draw the popular support I was seeking for this "new nickel".  Then I began to think outside of the box.  Who was popular enough to draw that kind of attention?  Then it hit me... it was so simple... Anna Kournikova.  She would be perfect for the job.  Ignore the fact the she is actually not an American and has never succeeded in anything in her life.  The chicks will dig it because it’s the first time a strait women has been on a coin (sorry Susan B. Anthony and that lesbo Indian).  The guys will like it, because...well I think that’s pretty obvious.  In a second informal poll by Mr. X 100% of those polled that this idea was a  sh!t hot  idea.  *   Mr. X tried to contact New York Senator Hillary Clinton about this idea, but the response was less than hopeful.  The politicians don't seem to think this is an important idea.  Sure our nation is at war and people need health care and stuff, but how long are we going to go on with such a faggy coin in our pockets.  The only way that these politicians are going to recognize the immediacy of this problem is if all of us get involved.  This will need to be a grass-roots campaign.   So, Join me and lets remake the face of the nickel. Lets make it a new, prettier, blonder, leggier, more attractive coin, a coin that we can be proud to call our own.       *The Mr. X poll questioned 1 person
