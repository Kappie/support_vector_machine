Now, I know from my personality psych class that positive thinking can make a big difference in how one experiences things, but I have a feeling this class is going to be fucking brutal.   That''s why I want to play the game at a different level.  While sorostitutes are busy rehashing feelings for boys, I plan on writing under the impression that whatever I produce should be able to be used as Slayer lyrics...This insures that no one in the class will like me, b) women will be scared and c) I'll keep myself entertained.  Writing about entrails and disembowlded corpses will be AWESOME.  Or better yet, I'll write sappy poetry that claims to be about breakups and feelings and  then  add the lines of disenbolwment...Yes it will be good.  I also decided I didn't want to put up with the same rhet teacher I have now for another semester.  I already have nightmares about the man yelling at me, (though he doesn't really yell) and as I was walking home with Buddy Holly and Pete the other day, they both expressed similar dissatisfaction for his lack of teaching skillz.  We all have no idea how we are going to be graded.  I know this will sound wrong, but I don't care: At least I know I'm not the worst writer in the class cause the slighty mentally retarded girl who chokes on her phelm is heading up the rear.  At least I'm better than one person
