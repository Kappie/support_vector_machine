"what am i doing right now?"... i suppose i only have 1 answer... SLACKING!!! actually, to say frankly, i dun think that i am working towards my goal... SAJC!!! i am still playing and sleeping... not studying at all... it's oredy june le... i cant imagine wat i will be doing for my prelim... getting 60%+ and scoring top 10 and i am satisfied???  i simply cant imagine it!! that's totally absurd... how to go SAJC with that kinda result... i might as well go to poly!! or aim for pioneer jc or catholic jc... they dun even want me i suppose!!! NO WAY!!! I WUN LET SUCH THINGS HAPPEN ON ME!!!  there's one thing i shud clarify... i keep on saying i hate my class... actually, i shudn't use such a harsh word lah... i dun hate my class actually... i juz dun like... i am not motivated to study bah... if there's no motivation, i dun seem like working towards my goal... i seem like easily contented... as long as can get top 10 i satisfied? i dun think that's wat i want lah... i wanto see some competition in my class...  aniwaes, 402s... have u thought of wat happen when u come back and get ur O level result???  Will u be hugging one another and say "Hey, buddy... Long time no see" or u will be juz greet one another a "HI' and walk away??  What will u be doing when u get back ur o level result slip from ms lim? elated cuz u get extremely fabulous result? or sad becuz u din do well for certain subj?  that's tooooo far... hehe... dun think too much... WORK HARD bah!! maybe u may have a better senario than those mentioned...
