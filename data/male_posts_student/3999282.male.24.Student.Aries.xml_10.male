I received a card from Lotus today. She wrote "Dear Jason, How is everything? Man, really envy you... You are still a student and I start to work already. Good luck when you go to Toronto. remember to see me when you visit Taiwan" She is a really nice girl and I will write her a letter once I am in Toronto.  The Sony-Ericsson Z200 cellphone is sooo cool^_^ The UI, and keypad, the flip, and rings..... I just like it!! I can't wait to start my new life there.  I can't recall what Edith looks like now, which is good. Sometimes I am still too childish, always want to win the "GAME". Thinking carefully, I didn't lose anything: I had a great time with her; I learned a lot from her, regardless they are positive or negative; and I got her first time (let's hope it was a lie too). She has the right to be with anyone, whom I think is bad luck :P
