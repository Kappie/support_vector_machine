I'm ok but I have a pain in the upper part of my right arm and the lower part of my left arm. It's not that bad, I can still work out. It's just an annoying type of pain like when you over-stretch or something. Hopefully it will go away in a couple of days. Today is my day-off-from-the-gym-day so all I did was some heavy morning cardio. Tomorrow i'll probably go to the aerobics class and then hopefully by friday my arms will fully recuperate.   What happend was kind of a wake-up call. If you're gonna be lifting heavy weights, you better becareful because theres nothing worse than getting an injury at the gym.   Anyway last night was the season premiere (of season 2) of Nip Tuck. It was awesome. 1 full hour. No commercials. The next episode will be shown next tuesday at 10 PM on FX.
