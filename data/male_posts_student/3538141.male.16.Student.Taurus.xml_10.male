In fact, I must be one of the few people who cheers and groans more at the news than at the footy.  Well, who can blame me?  England-France is  sooooo  last millenium!  The real match these days is England-Iraq.  Does America represent Sven, or am I getting pseudo-deep?   A disclaimer - I am not being remotely serious.  Anyone who takes this seriously is Wayne Rooney
