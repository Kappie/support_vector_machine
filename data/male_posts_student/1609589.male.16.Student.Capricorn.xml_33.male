I was thinking about this thing my friend designed- it's a barcode, and in place of where the numbers should be, it says "BE YOURSELF." I went on the internet, found a picture of a barcode, and remade that on the computer. I'll give it to her once i get back home.  Got me thinking about conformity. How this whole world revolves about obeying the system, by being the same. How there are people who subconsciously realize this, and strive to be different by doing things people don't "normally" do, thus creating goths, punks, and everything inbetween. What they don't realize is, they started another kind of system, another social... 'thing' where everyone is the same. There's no escaping it.  Some people would counter that by saying "if you do it alone, its wierd, and when you do it together, it's a club." I used to say that. But then you have to ask yourself a question- "Why are there no wierd people, then?" Everybody is following somebody. There are barely any new ideas to be had these days.  My motto has always been "If it's not fun, why do it?" Even though I've always mostly obeyed by the rules... mostly.  Then things come along to help the 'differences' to become the same. There's Hot Topic, which you all hopefully have read about in an earlier post, and other things, but I'm hard pressed to list them right now.  When a friend of mine (the one i stole the barcode idea from) read my little article about hot topic, she said "Thanks alot, I work at Hot Topic!" I didn't say it, but what I thought was "Good. Feeding off the system. I'm all in favor of that."-although now, I wonder why i didn't say it.  Well, that's enough out of me for now. That took me about 15 minutes to think up and write, plus when my internet cut out and i had to reboot, so there we go!
