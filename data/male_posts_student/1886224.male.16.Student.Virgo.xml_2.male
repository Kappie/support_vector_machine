Besides, there was lightning and I had to call it...didn't want to play in the rain. Return of the King comes out tomorrow on DVD...can't wait for that. Dum dum di dum...killing time......blah! Yanks off today..no sports to watch on tv. School...sucks. Oh, my mom came home today and told me that I was sending nasty text messages to a friend of mine who ditched us for his girl. 1) I didn't send any text messages and 2)if someone did...he deserved it. His girlfriend has taken over his life! We gotta save him.  Weird news of the day:  urlLink Mayor Tells Sorcerers to Banish Evil Spirits
