Except that there's no horizon, no ships, and I have something with which to defend myself. So I guess it's not a very good analogy.  I have those damn SATs that I've been mentioning in the last few posts the day after tomorrow. That evil saturday morning. I bet there's a reason for it being on Saturday! It's some kinda... not-Jewish conspiracy to make us all take the test on the jewish day of rest... yeah, that's it. Makes perfect sense to me :-P.  Anyway, I hate those things and so in an effort to calm down as the test approaches, I've been relaxing and playing my guitar and listening to music, chatting online, looking up tabs, playing the occasional game of SC, and I mixed in studying all day. I'd say I worked a good 3 hours today. The rest went to the things listed above and a couple meals... Oh, and a shower.  I practiced that Built to Spill song called Big Dipper. I'm getting a bit better, but the chugga-chuggas are throwing me off. It's a cool song that was passed down to me by Peter who learned it from his brother, John Marie who learned it I-don't-know-how. I submitted the tabs to OLGA yesterday afternoon and still haven't gotten a response. It's not posted on the site either so I guess they haven't gotten to it yet. They said to wait a week so it looks like I've got some waiting to do.  We're (The Michael Stevens are bringing me) to "the hill" on the 8th where we will be remembering great people and playing and doing a few things in their remembrance. It'll be kinda hard for me but I think it'll be for the better.  Moving on, I got 50 bucks today from my grandparents that I am gonna save up towards a new electric guitar (~$1300) :-). I know it'll be a while but still, we have to start somewhere, right?  I am tired. Thank you for reading. May the faithfully departed rest in peace.         -- Feanor
