As the majority of you will know, my goal is to go through the Royal College of Music and become a full-time trombonist with possibly the Royal Philharmonic. However, my dream is to be famous as the singer for a rock band. See it as immature if you will, I don't know. It's a dream. Every song we get together, every song we complete, and every time we add another to our list of songs to record, it feels like the dream becomes more and more possible. My belief is that if I am going to do it with any band, NJaN is probably the one with the most chance. But I'm not sure we could quite make it with Peugeot's trademark.  Love, Jon Roskilly
