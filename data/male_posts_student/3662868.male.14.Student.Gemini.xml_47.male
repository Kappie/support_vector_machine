Those are the ones that get locked up inside. Try to lock it away. Shield it from the light. No one knows the pain.      How we use those things can greatly alter and effect how we function. Use it correctly, and there'll be no problem. Use it in correctly, and things...Happen. Change.             Carelessness with dangerous materials leads to accidents.
