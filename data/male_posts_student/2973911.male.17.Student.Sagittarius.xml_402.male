If only his cellphone his working so at least a text message that would only cost me a peso or a text message sent from one of the various sms sites in the net would do to at least ask him,    "Where the hell are you!?! Are you even still alive and breathing in the normal human sense?"    Oh well... That's why we're doing this internet thing, right? To keep connected. *sigh*
