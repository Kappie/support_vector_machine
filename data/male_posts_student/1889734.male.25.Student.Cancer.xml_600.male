"The Bush broadband policies don't do anything to provide the new resources that will be needed to deploy broadband in rural and urban areas and they are not addressing the regulatory barriers that prevent deployment.  "There is a bill before Congress -- that has been championed by John Kerry -- that gives tax incentives to companies to deploy broadband in underserved areas," Cutter continued.   This is another fundamental difference between the Left and Right.  The Left uses taxes as a means of engineering change, by trying to force the market to do things that shouldn't be done.  Why should money be spent to run broadband to rural areas when there is no profit in doing so?  Rural customers should pay more to defray the cost of the infrastructure and service.  To require utilities to absorb cost and reduce profits is riduculous.  If you choose to live in the country, you must accept the sacrifices that come with that choice.  Why should we have to subsidize your lifestyle?  Should we also subsidize a cinema megaplex in every town smaller than 10,000?  How about access to a Best Buy?
