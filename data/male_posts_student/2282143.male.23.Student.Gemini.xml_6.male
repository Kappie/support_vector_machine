The reason why I am still here is because I wanted to go to church with Sammy.  I guess she says it wasnt as horrible as it usually is, but any church with a drum kit kicks ass in my mind.  Ok, not really, but its HYSTERICAL!  Dude, who uses a drum kit in church?!?!  I mean, Lamb of God sounded like a slow dance.  All it needed was a little cymbal fade and I would have been all over Sam.  The rest of the music wasnt great.  I mean, it wasnt that the choir of all 5 people wasn't bad, it was just the crappiest music selection I have ever heard.  Odd church overall.  Music was totally nuts, the set up was a bit crazy, and not much of a message to be found.  I would have imagined something along the lines of the crazy email Tom sent Sam about the Catholics need to fight the sin of homosexuality (see post below).  But nothing like that.  I guess thats a good thing, but still the homily wasn't that great.  Yeah, so the set up, it was weird.  Not typical church setup.  No pews, just a bunch of upholstered chairs welded together.  And the room itself reminded me of the barn at Cletus.  Notice how I call it a "barn" if that gives you any idea...  Anyways, the girl in front of us definately wasnt Catholic and when communion starts, she turns to her boyfriend and says "EWWW!  Everyone drinks from the same cup?!?"  That was funny.  Just goes to show you how much different christian religions actually know about each other.  I mean, shoot, I have no fucking clue what anyone else does.  Except Baptist.  Been to a Baptist funeral before.  Tonight was an experience I probably couldn't forget, even if I tried.  I suggest to all of you, try a new parish/church.  You never really know what you're gonna find.   On a different note, I cant believe that in one month its gonna be Christmas and already a year will have gone by without TJ.  I dunno.  I cant seem to go to church and end up being happy with God for that one.  Oh yeah, the little duder would have been 23 on the 10th this month.  Must admit, still kinda numb.  I even laughed when the Rams beat the Bears the other weekend, cursing the boy with a big smile on my face.  Life hasnt been the same since...  On another another note, Sammy is most definately a domestic Goddess (and no, she didnt tell me to write this...).  I have done nothing this weekend except eat awesome oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and also pumpkin crunch cake.  Right now she is making us farfalle and rotini for dinner.  Ohhhh yeah.  Speaking of which, its done!  Mmmmmmmmmm dinner!
