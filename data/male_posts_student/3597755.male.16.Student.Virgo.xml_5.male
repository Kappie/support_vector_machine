The European Chamionships are therefore topping my things-to-view list. There is one thing I am not happy with during this tournament.  There are some good parts. Germany qualified. Turkey didn't. I am glad Germany qualified because they're almost as arrogant as us, dutchies. I don't really like arrogance but in this case it's positive because I'm against the Dutch team. And German arrogance is not seldom used against our dutch arrogance. I'm glad Turkey didn't qualify because every match won by the Turkish team would mean that some of our Turkish citizens think it would be nice at that time to get in their car, race through the streets without removing their hand from the horn. I know the matches aren't at night but it would've annoyed me anyway.  But, as I said, there is one thing I dislike about the tournament. The ducth team. Perhaps even more, the dutch supporters. The Dutch team consists out of arrogant people who are tired after a long season and unwilling to risk their lives for the dutch team (meaning they won't give 100% in a match). Their coach is an equally arrogant asshole who can't stand bad press and who's such a tactical genius to swich to a formation almost never used just before the tournament starts.  The worst really are the supporters. They are stupid, they're arrogant and they are most of all, stupid. No, the dutch team won't win no matter what you say. No, your support isn't needed by anyone. No, people who are more or less sophisticated don't like you. You're a bunch of assholes who should stay at home. Besides, you should never wear orange. I respond to orange like a bull responds to red. (no, a bull does not respond to red, just to movement but you know what I mean) Self fulfilling prophecy: Ohne Holland fahren wir zum WM.
