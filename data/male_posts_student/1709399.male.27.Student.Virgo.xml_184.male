Another Sporting Legend ( After Pete sampras) leaves the stage to conquer millions of hearts in Kolkata . Steve is the ultimate role model for mental toughness , a very important trait in any form of sport . The 200  Against W.Indies at Jamaica in 1995 still stands in my eyes as one of the finest innings in this era. I am glad in a way that he is retiring , because he is now going to be an ambassador for hundreds of under-privileged citizens of Kolkata. Steve is not just a great cricketer , he is a great Human being which is much more rarer trait these days .                                             Here is a  urlLink Salute  to him by my favorite Sportswriter Nirmal Shekar of THE HINDU .
