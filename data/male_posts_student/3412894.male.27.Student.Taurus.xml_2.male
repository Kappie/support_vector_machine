Thesis  Sexual relationships between teachers and students have become commonplace, which now obliges institutions to set up necessary boundaries to permanently prevent amorous teacher-student relationships.  Similar to a clinician-patient relationship, ethical concerns for students’ interests require teachers to remain cognizant of the level of their intimacy in student-teacher relationships in order to sustain a healthy moral divide and to protect the integrity of the educational system.      II. Argument    There are too many arguments in favor of a permanent and universal ban on sexual relations between teachers and their students (dual relationships) for the matter to go unnoticed.  My argument, however, will not attempt to make a case against the obvious: relationships founded on the bases of intentionally extorting sex from students, or intentionally extorting inflated grades from teachers are wrong.  Instead I will analyze the destructive facets inborn in sexual relations between teachers and students.        On the surface of the dilemma, one can accept the philosophy that “students [are] entitled to be[ing] educated without having to give sexual favors in exchange [for fair education]” (Schulhofer 195-196).  Schulhofer’s statement should be taken one step further—there ought to be a permanent ban on teacher-student sexual relationships as they violate the moral boundaries of the teacher-student fiduciary  trust.  A permanent ban is a necessary step in thwarting teacher-student sexual relations during the span of their professional interactions, and it would also prevent teachers and students from yielding unfair favors in exchange for laying the foundation for future relationships.    My contention is clear: teachers and students must coexist platonically for the sake of student’s well-being and the sanctity of the educational system.  Rutter agrees; he maintains that there is a “forbidden zone [that] always exists in the relationship between doctor and patient, therapist and client, . . . lawyer and client, teacher and student” (1989).   Students ought to be able to attend classes with the sole concern of hurdling rigorous academic obstacles, not fulfilling their teachers’ sexual needs.   Although students shouldn’t sexually entice their teachers, the burden to resist rightly rests on teachers, because they are the more powerful members of the relationship.  Plaut (1993) concurs; due to a teacher’s fiduciary responsibility, “it is . . . the responsibility of the person in the more powerful position to control the necessary boundary between the two parties.”   Plaut’s  “necessary boundary,” however, doesn’t mean that teachers can’t maintain close mentoring relationships with their students; after all, studies show that “graduate student  relations with members of the faculty [in particular] is regarded by most graduate students as the most important aspect of the quality of their graduate experience” (Bargar  Mayo-Chamberlain, 1983).  A case can be made that a balanced teacher-student platonic bond can greatly enhance the quality of a student’s educational experience.          Again, when teachers enter into amorous sexual relations with students they compromise the boundaries of their fiduciary trust, which is a key component of academic ethics essential to education.  Stepping over the fiduciary trust line would “undermine . . . the atmosphere of trust on which the educational process depends” (Galbraith 1986).        The most unwitting teacher who enters into an outwardly consensual “no strings attached” sexual relationship with one of his students jeopardizes his academic integrity.  The problem may play out one evening while he sits at his desk grading term papers.  He comes upon his girlfriend-student’s paper.  He reads it, but he realizes that it doesn’t meet her usual academic standards.  In fact, he may consider the paper average at best.  Thoughts inundate his mind and lead him into a depraved internal conflict: This grade would have an impact on her grade point average.  What should I do?  If I give her a C, she may levy a claim against me that may cost me my job.  If I give her the A that she expects I’ll be cheating the other students who worked so hard on their papers. The rightfully suspicious teacher, having put himself into a compromising situation realizes that the risks are too high.  By nature of the circumstances he feels compelled to give his girlfriend-student an A on her paper.  Consequently, due to his inability to control his sexual desires his girlfriend-student is cheated  out of receiving an authentic assessment of her work.  The teacher, his girlfriend-student, and the academic system have fallen victim to a sexual whim.   Teacher-student amorous relationships tend to victimize more than just teachers’ lovers/students.  Delusional teachers who sometimes believe that they are involved in loving relationships become incapable of assessing their loved-ones’ work critically and objectively. Ultimately, unforeseen ramifications stem from teachers’ poor decision making and fleece other students out of receiving their just academic grade .  In extreme cases it can land undeserving students in colleges and universities while those who deserve admittance are shut-out.  III. Consideration of Objectives  There are people within the educational system who do not align themselves with this theory.  They contend that a teacher’s entering into a relationship with a student is neither unhealthy nor contrary to a student’s best interests.  University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee professor, Jane Gallop was censured for entering into a “consensual amorous relationship” with one of her students.  She brushes aside Plaut’s contention that the more powerful person in a relationship should maintain a necessary boundary.  She believes that teachers and students should be allowed to enter into sexual relationships, because “divorc[ing] the intellect from the libido . . .  [is] dehumanizing and dull” (salon.com).  If Professor Gallop’s position were to become part of our educational bylaws, it would serve to compromise teacher-student fiduciary trust, and the integrity of assessment which are key features of academic integrity. If Professor Gallop were somehow able to defy the collective assertions of Schulhofer, Rutter, and Plaut by establishing a dichotomous personal self and a professional self, and devise a way to fairly assess her lovers’ work she would still generate a toxic climate of distrust.  Many of Gallop’s students would be incapable of accepting her academic appraisal as valid, since she is a teacher who is intimately involved with one of their competing classmates.   Actions like Gallop’s must be banned because they serve to usurp her position as an educator, and they tend to breed suspicion that a teacher who is intimately involved with a student will be likely to grade that student favorably.   David R. Pichaske, an English professor at Southwest State University wrote a February 1995 article in The Chronicle of Higher Education to voice his opinion against a ban on professor-student relationships.  In his article he disputes the theory that a person with professional power can unfairly alter the course of a relationship.  Pichaske states that students hold the bulk of the power in student-teacher relationship.  Professors, not students, often become victims in teacher-student relationships; a professor caught-up with a young student may be subjected to horrors such as “acting half his age: working out in the gym, playing Sting  tapes  on his office boom box, trading his wing tips for a pair of black Nike Airs.  There’s no fool like an old fool” (Pichaske p. 13).  Pichaske finds that the pain in a teacher-student relationship rests in the heart of the teacher, because he changes his schedule to keep-up with the demands of a young person. A major fault in Pichaske’s contention is that he incorrectly places some of the burden of teacher-student sexual relations on students.  The sole academic power—the power to grade—is given to the teacher, not the student.  He also puts all of the weight of his argument in his belief that a teacher-student relationship exists primarily in the personal realm, yet his essay demonstrates that the personal and professional can and will converge:  He recounts having knowledge of “only one actual [quid pro quo] sex-for-grade trade” (i.e., a mixture of business and pleasure) (Pichaske p. 14).  Pichaske argues on his colleague’s behalf: “[S]he was thinking . . . [that the sex act was a sign of] true love,” which should have highlighted her immaturity and her unequal bargaining power.  Her naïveté led to her not being “easily discouraged.  She haunted my colleague’s office for hours, days, weeks.  He tried being polite; then he tried ignoring her; then he tried insulting her.  Nothing drove her away” (Pichaske p. 14).   The results of Pichaske’s recount of his colleague’s forbidden love affair uncover an incident led to academic dishonesty, a violation of fiduciary trust, and a professor’s needing to “insult” his student in order to terminate their relationship.    IV. Conclusion Reasons in support of a permanent ban on teacher-student sexual relationships outweigh the reasons to tolerate them.  Most importantly, teacher-student sexual relations should be prohibited because they undermine the sanctity of the academic community.  Most students work diligently to earn respectable grades; unfortunately, others receive good grades by entering into sexual relations with teachers.  With this known, anything less than a universal ban on student-teacher sexual relationships would serve to jeopardize academia’s evenhandedness.         Work Cited Barger R.
