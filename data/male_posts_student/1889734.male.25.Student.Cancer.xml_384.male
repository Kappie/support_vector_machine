She manages to work he economy and Osama into what starts as a movie review of the Passion.  What is it about this movie?  I haven't seen it, and I don't share the faith, but it rubs me the wrong way when people try to tear it down.  It's a very important story, and this is simply Gibson's take on it.  He's entitled to make a movie with his own money.  Sure, his father's looney comments aren't helping him on the anti-semite angle, but since when do we condemn the son for the sins of the father?  I was watching Dennis Miller last night and some mild mannered looking Lefty spouted off about Gibson being a hatemonger, goose stepping and 'seig heil'-ing in the living room with his father.    Whether or not you believe Jesus is the Son of God, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that a man named Jesus was crucified under the circumstances portrayed in the Bible.  Are we to change the story because of the sentiments of people?  I can't imagine hating the Jews for their involvement.  Like Don has said many times, without Pilate and the Jewish urgings to kill Christ, what would we have?  God sent him here to go through the Passion, so shouldn't we also see the killers as part of God's Will?  The rampant hatred of this movie is bothering me, and I'm not sure why.  I guess I shouldn't really care, but I decided a long time ago that I respect people's faith (so long as that faith doesn't involve blowing up busses every day).  Gibson has made, by all accounts, a remarkable movie that is more important to him than anything he has ever done.  Shouldn't we respect the man for the power of his convictions?  As for DOWD, read her banality and there is little wonder she lives in an isolated New York bubble, surrounded by her fellow small minded intellectuals.  Has anyone in this group seen this thing yet?  Report back if you do.  I'm going to try to go this weekend.
