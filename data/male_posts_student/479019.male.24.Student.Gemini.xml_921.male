Me: haha Me: I'm more of the del taco person... if I was in the del taco of love, I'd be satisfied   Not a lot going on today. Just more cleaning and packing. Did some chatting with some friends online. I'm outta here in 2 more days!  I want to say that this year has been so much of a better year than last year. Yea I've ranted and complained about stuff, and yes the world is still shitty due to American foreign policy... however, this year has been better in that I've found my groove, produced good work, and met extremely cool people.   I'm looking forward to summer now. I will, however, have to get research done and a job. But I wonder if it's going to be anything like last summer. For reals, last summer was absolutely insane. Drunken parties, Vegas, concerts, concussions, molotov cocktails, punk rock midgets, The Schayer Impersonator, punching a ceiling, karaoke, vomit, drama, action, comedy... it's amazing no one got hospitalized or arrested.  Let's get ready to rumble!  ***
