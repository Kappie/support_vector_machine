Though a few days have passed since my late night, I still haven't fully recovered. I'm still dead tired. Even worse, I have a quiz today in my ethics class. I just can't get a break.  Yesterday was father's day. I got my dad the soundtrack for  urlLink  A Mighty Wind  . He seemed to be happy about that. Unfortunately, my wife  I spent $20 on that CD. We had to buy it at  urlLink Borders  (which is always overpriced) because they didn't have the disc at  urlLink Best Buy . It should be against the law to sell CDs for more than $15.
