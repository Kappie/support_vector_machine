I actually stayed partially awake this morning in lecture but this afternoon for 2 hours I was in and out of conscienceness and my notes looked like I was having seizures.  But on to the "fun", nerdy part of my day.  Our class spent 3 hours in the gross lab today.  You must understand that our class has about 270 people in it and we all fit into the lab.  It is quite a huge space but still pretty tight when that many people are in it.   Our group was behind from yesterday as far as dissecting simply because the one girl got sick and I wanted to make sure she was O.K. and also because we were being very careful (slow) when reflecting and cleaning all the goodies we were supposed to look at.  So today we rock and rolled our way back to being on schedule.  I performed my first and probably last laminectomy on poor Ruby.  I don't think she enjoyed it as much as I did.  I believe I did have a weird grin on my face as I took a bone saw to the spinal column.  As one guy in my class put it, he felt like scorpian from Mortal Kombat.  Oh how I miss those childhood memories of playing that game ad infinitum.  I didn't get nearly enough studying done tonight mainly because I fielded a few phone calls and my friend Mike came over to study.  And when I say study I do mean watch the Olympics with it on mute.  And when I say on mute I mean that it really doesn't matter if there is sound or not, our eyes were not in our books.  Oh well, it's only the third day :-)  I'm exhausted and looking for a good nights rest.  I'll share more feelings some other time, today just took a lot out of me and tomorrow is going to be equally trying.  You can see why I live by the philosophy of only taking one day at a time as it comes to you.  Otherwise I think my mind would blow.  God Bless.
