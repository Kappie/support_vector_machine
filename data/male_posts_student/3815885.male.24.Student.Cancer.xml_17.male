Art is supposed to be fun - he needs to stop teaching like a coroner.  God's love for us is timeless - many people don't realize this - that God loves unconditionally  - That means "no matter what".  It doesn't give you an open invitation to live a life of debauchery and sin; but it is there to let you know that Abba's arms are always open to embrace a child of His own and hold them when they are hurt from the world's fiery arrows >>---->
