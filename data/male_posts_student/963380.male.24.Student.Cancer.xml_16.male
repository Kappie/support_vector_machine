My letter to Mr. Gates  Dear Mr. Gates,              Even though you made me buy another Xbox just to get online, I forgive you. I just bitchslapped some texan motherfucker upside the head with a god damned Particle Projection Canon. Then I shot the building beside him. The building fell on him. I laughed. He heard me laughing.   The greatest thing I've ever experienced happened next. He cried. I fucking heard him starting to cry. He logged out a few seconds later - but my manical laughter and extremely prejudicial l33t skillz made some big tough texan steer ball like a baby.  Thank you Bill. I even forgive you for Windows 95 and Windows Millenium for this. Clean slate bro.  Now boot up your Xbox and some mechassault. I bet I can get you sobbing in Melinda's arms in less time than it takes to make a decent bag of popcorn.  Pussy.  Sincerely,  Graham.  Incidently, Wireless internet fucking rules.
