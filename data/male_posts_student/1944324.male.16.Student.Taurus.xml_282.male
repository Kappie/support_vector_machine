I have an iPod! I finally fixed the port and I have music on there. Right now I'm listening to music from Finding Nemo.  There are about 11 intended links supposed to be up there. If you don't know who any of these people are, you don't watch enough TV. However, I'm nice enough to give you an idea: Joan of Arcadia, Gilmore Girls, Alias, Enterprise (recapper), ER, The OC and Everwood. Just go to your friendly search engine and type in "Television Without Pity" I promise I'll read a webcomic if you do this.
