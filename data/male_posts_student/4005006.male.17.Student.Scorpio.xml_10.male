You see, shes possibly the greatest chance I've got of having a brilliant and beautiful girl who cares about me. I don't deserve someone like her by my side. I'm ugly, pathetic, a complete bastard. I wish I could explain it... I'm writing it all down, for the whole world to read if they really want to... feel free to laugh and point at the looser in my comments if you wish.   Today she tells me of someone else she likes,a friend, a male friend. Sure, no problem, she can have male friends, I wouldnt dare stop her. I'm not jealous or envious or anything like that. I told her that as long as she says she loves me, I will trust her and I will believe her and I will always love her back... thats how I feel... but what I also can't help feeling is that this guy is probably a million times better for her than me.   He's going to be better looking, he's going to be more her age, and probably nearer to her than I am. No contest. I'm a fucking minger. Just go look on my profile! I'm 17 going out with a 14 year old, how many of you out there are going to say that I'm some kind of sick pedophile? I live in Kent, near Tunbridge Wells (UK) while she lives 200 miles away near Birmingham. It costs 40-50 quid to get up there or for her to get down here, I can't yet drive and as discussed previously, I SUCK! Who knows if we would EVER see eachother.   The problem? I love her, I can't stop thinking of her, I don't want to lose her... but if she would be happier with someone else, who am I to stop her? What's the point really? I've never KNOW the happiness I've felt reecently since we met.  Now. I am Sad. I don't quite know what to do. I dont know if she will read this or not. I don't know if I will talk to her about this in future. It's nice to see that once again God has filled me with a doubt, a sadness, possibly a test to see how I will react. Probably a fucking punishment for... oh well I'm sure you can guess.   Anyone with any ideas, comments, suggestions, or if you just wanna kick the shit out of me for being such a sad-case... feel free.   Currently listening to David Hodges - Breahte (Featuring Amy Lee). Lovely piano ballad.   Anyway, I'm depressed, I won't have another chance like this, I feel like I've already blown it. Here's to another 17 years of waiting and sadness and loneliness probably. So, I'm going to get drunk on Bailey's and Tequilla and Whiskey and Archers...   Night. Dxx
