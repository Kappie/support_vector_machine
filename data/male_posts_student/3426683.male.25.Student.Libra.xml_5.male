By now, between my financial situation and a general frustration with the whole academic apparatus, I think I may have laid waste to all the bridges back to that world that I may have had.    Within the next few months, I'll be moving back to Boston, and, although I don't think I'd really want to go back to UNC or grad school if I could (see  urlLink here  for some reasons, particularly or specifically -- your choice -- the point about Dickens and Collins), it's really odd to have absolutely no net there.   As for the Dickens/Collins thing (and I  really  like Collins' short work), it's a bit bogus that the field feels that nearly everything that can be said about the aesthetics of Dickens or Melville has been said.  I didn't go to grad school to work on second tier authors (*cough*Harriet Martineau*cough*) just because no one else was working on them or to get a job at an R1.  And, for me, although this could just be me and only me, cultural studies promotes that sort of work.  It levels the playing field and creates a world where the works of Martineau or even people more famous like Collins or Elizabeth Barrett Browning are as valuable as the works of Ruskin, Dickens, Austen, or BrontÃ«.  Dogs and cats living together, anyone?   Addendum : I should say that I like EBB, too, but she's just not on the same level as her husband or Tennyson.  That'd be like comparing, oh, say, Jim Rice and Mike Greenwell.  Gator was a great LF, but Rice was one of the best hitters in the game between 1975 and 1986.  And, yes, unrelated to my problems with graduate school, Rice should be in the Hall of Fame.
