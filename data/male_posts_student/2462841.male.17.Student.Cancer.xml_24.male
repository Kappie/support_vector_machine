My circle firefox extension totally broke on me, so I decided to rewrite it (i just couldn't find what was wrong with it, kept getting an error message on the first line in the file, regardless of how I changed it).  Orkut's community is mediochre, its kinda dull actually so anyone desperate to get in, I suggest you wait until its a tad more mature. I also converted all my music to the vorbis (.ogg) format, and I can't wait till I get a mac (preferably a powerbook g5 when they come out). Suse is nice, but OSX is miles smoother, and I love the eyecandy. Oh, by the way gmail is totally awesome!, its filters and conversation management are incredible, the only thing lacking is autoforwarding and pop links, but I can easily live without those.  Spiderman 2 was great, but I reckon thunderbirds will be better. I can't wait!
