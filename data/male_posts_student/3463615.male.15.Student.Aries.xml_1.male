Nah, I guess I wouldn't do that... Anyway, way to steal my idea for your post from my other blog, also you stole words from Adam Sandler's songs. Come up with your own damn stuff you freakin' communist bastard. =)  That aside, I'd like to say your eye-crust post was exceedingly stomach wrenching Robert, was that your desired effect?  Not much else to say now besides that so I'll end my first post here.   P.S. I'll be expecting a witty remark from you Alex. And take heed, the GrandMaster doesn't like to be disappointed. Bitch. =D
