I wouldn't be exaggerating if I called them a 'revolutionary' band. They entered the mainstream at the time when jhankar ruled, hideous rip-offs such as baby-yeah(remember sajjad ali?) were super hits and the word 'rock' was alien to 90% of our population. They are indeed the pioneers of Pakistani rock. While mummy daddies refused to recognize junoon's efforts as 'music', a larger part of the youth embraced junoonism. To them junoon was a passion that became more intense with each album. Although its roots lie in Pakistan, Junoon has enjoyed fame and success all over the world, courtesy the international music channels such as V and MTV that pampered it every now and then. The band was successful enough to create a new genre in Pakistan, the Sufi rock. With music inspired by Jimmy Hendrix, Jeff Black, Led Zeppelin and U2 and lyrics of great mystic poets such as Bulley Shah, Rumi, Ghalib and Iqbal, Junoon created a fusion that rocked the nation. (And a lot of other stuff too*wink*) Junoon's music is not categorized. It covered a wide range of topics in its music, from politics to the rise and fall of the taliban; they spoke up for all in their songs. Their bluntness and boldness added to their charms. They mustered up the guts in the time where media was anything but 'free'. The band began their work in 1990, when it comprised of Ali Azmat as the vocalist,Salman Ahmed the acoustic and electrical guitarist cum back up vocalist and Nusrat Hussain on the bass guitar. Their first album, Junoon, did not manage to hit the skies. It was highly criticized on, which isn't anything out of the blues for a new set up in Pakistan. It takes some time for us to get over the past and move on with something new all the time isn't it? The album Junoon, nonetheless, had some amazing tracks that were recognized in the later years such as Heer, Neend ati nahi and Rangoon main khoya. The negative response did not make Junoon lose all hopes. A year later, after bidding farewell to Nusrat Hussain and welcoming Brian o Connell as the bass guitarist, Junoon came up with their second album 'Talaash', a truck and roll album which funny to think was sponsored by close up. It was Brian's first album but his finesse didn't come until the third album, Inquilaab, released in 1995.Inquilab was no doubt the strongest pillar for Junoon.It proved their strength and rocked the Paki music scene with the smashing hit such as Husan waloon, Khwaab, Heeray and Saeein.Junoon was now a stable hit in Pakistan. In 1996 the cricket world cup saw a rise of a patriotic song "Jazba Junoon" that became an instant hit with the already crazed stalker cricket fans. The sales of their album, soared high and now their fan following included people of all ages, not just teeny boppers. The video for their religious devotion based song, Saeen managed to change the opinions of many critics including the country's so-called mullahs. The fifth album came out in 1997.Named Kashmakash, it again hit the top charts but this surely wasn't the best there was to Junoon.The band broke all previous records and entered the international market when their album "Azadi" was released. The head banging, typical rock style was so in, it gave all parents the freaks yet nothing could stop the growing fame of Junoon.Songs such as Khudi, Meree awaz sunoo and Yar bina were widely acclaimed and junoon became a household name. Junoon received  appreciation and acknowledgement even from the neighboring India, which was incredible, keeping in view the relations of the two countries at that time. The band won a golden disc for Azaadi at an international music channel awards after sharing the stage with top class international bands such as Pearl Jam, Oasis, Bush and the likes.  Their video for the song "ehtesaab" focused on our corrupt politicians and was ,as expected, banned from our local TV stations. The then P.M of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, banned the band claiming it was due to the promotion of jeans and long hair in Pakistani culture but it was a widely known fact that the ban was inflicted since Junoon refused to sing for his "karz utaro mulk sawaro' scheme and did the song "ehtesaab" with imran khan instead. The ban did not dampen their spirits, Junoon carried on with their promotion for peace. The band maintained a consistent ethical rectitude. Record sales were the highest for Azadi and it remains to be the king of all albums. The next album Parvaaz was by far superior to anything junoon had ever made. The production was flawless and the album had a complete theme and songs that seem liked they belonged. Plus it had ghoom, the epic. The song that had single-handedly defined junoon's greatness. Too bad the album did not do well in India. That got Junoon wondering what the hell happened and ever since they are clutching to the old fame which is somewhat fading away. The Pakistani music scene has gone much mature in the past 13 years and the audience has a vast choice now. With innumerable bands sailing in the sea, Junoon has a lot more competiton. Their next albums did not carry out the old charm and failed to impress the Junoonis. No wonder there were so many converts from 'junoonism'.Junoon's music now is more commercial than ever and now with the different directions and ali azmat's solo tracks out, there is not much doubt left about the 'stability' of the band. Their latest album deewar was no help to the falling repute and fame of the band, instead it made the fall deeper and with a louder 'thud'. Everything aside, Junoon has made its name written in gold in the Pakistani music history. With over 20 million records selling world wide, the band did play their fair share in making Pakistan proud. Many of us Junoonis have grown up with Junoon's music. It has been a part of us for over 13 years and it is no wonder we feel a sense of loyalty towards the band. We do miss 'our' junoon, the one that lacked commercialism. Every Junooni has a Junoon moment, and in return Junoon has a song for every situation in our life. There is a fondness for Junoon in our hearts for it has been with us for long. Funny how their music inspired us and changed our lives yet we never got to thank them. So here I do it finally, All hail to Junoon, for being what they are and for playing their part in our lives. And of course, for also making us realize there is more to ‘music’ than some do dee daa crap. Junoon rocks!!!
