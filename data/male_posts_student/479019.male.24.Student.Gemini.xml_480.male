I basically went home and passed out after work. My energy levels are pretty low. Bad eating habits, no exercise, and other craziness has me worn out.  I've been wanting to bake a pizza from scratch of late... I think I'll do that tomorrow.  Counting myself I have 4 people set for Vegas.  Friendster is officially scary now. I now have Gary and Hasani in my personal network. I was linked to Gary by 4 completely unrelated and random people. I was linked via Linda, Minnow, Abby, and Esther. Abby was the only one that made sense since we all went to Sierra Vista, but the other ones were a bit out there. I know Linda through an ITASA thing and she went to CSUF. Minnow is from like San Gabriel and goes to UCSD. Esther, I suppose goes to the same school as Gary... but UCLA is a big f-ing school. The rest of the high school posse find it kind of funny, yet scary.  I'm listening to some  Pulley  right now.  ***
