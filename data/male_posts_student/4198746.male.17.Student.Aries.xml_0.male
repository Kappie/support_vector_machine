I just feel like yelling at her, "Do we look fucking stupid?". Other than that class and everything else is going pretty well. Jen and I are doing well, which is always good. Graduation is May 19, I'm counting down the days. Only...oh screw it there's still a lot of days left. If you want to know exactly get a calendar and do the counting yourself. Sorry if it seems I have an attitude, I really don't. Control the pet population and have your pets spayed or neutered. Till next time everyone.
