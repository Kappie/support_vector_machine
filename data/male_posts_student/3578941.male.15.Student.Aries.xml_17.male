The Perfect Score: I will give this movie a 8 because it was halarious;y funny but some parts would drag on a little bit too long.  Overall it was one of the teen movies with actual teen situations that a thirty year old man would think we would have. Plus there is a really really hot gothic chick that any one who would see this movie would want to fuck very soon. I mean the first time you see her in the movie just makes you want to fuck her. ********  leave a god damn comment or i will kill you
