But, what he had to deal with was that my Grandmother and I had an awesome relationship that my grandfather did not want to step into our time. But when my grandmother died he felt that it was now his tme to get to know me and even start a relationship. As time grew long our friendship became stronger. But he was diagnosed with cancer a while ago and when he told me that he was going to die soon it really put a strain on our relationship. But that starin never really stopped us from having fun. But then one terrible night in September he passed away. But I will always know that no matter where I am or what i am doing he will always be there to watch oveer me and take care of me just like he did for my entire life.
