He takes the 'easy' route by distorting the Kay testimony, ignoring the crucial statements from the weapons inspector about the ongoing efforts of Saddam to obtain prohibited technology.  Again, I can't express strongly enough my anger that these people are striving to build a standard of proof that will never allow us to defend ourselves until the mushroom cloud is on our soil.
