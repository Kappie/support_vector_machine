Friday night I went out to the fantastic establishment called the Laurel Mall and walked around there for about 20 minutes. After browsing the same old stores, we went over to Gallery Of Sound to browse around the same old shelves of cds. Then we went to Radioshack and AT for some reason I'm unaware of before heading off to Damons to watch the games and play the trivia game there. (which we lost horribly) And boy did the Yankees get spanked. Saturday comes along and it's nice out so I go to play basketball with Neil, George and Greco. Nothing out of the ordinary. Except a good thing out of this weekend was the NFL Draft.   That's all I need to say. At least this week is the Hafey Bazaar. Ah yes. The bazaar. Where everyone goes to lose their money on the wheels and enjoy a nice waffle and ice cream. But at least it's an entire half day of nothing. Until then I shall be unhappy and melancholic. Well I guess I really can't complain.This school year is almost over and the year wasn't too challenging. And the end of the school year means the birth of that little span of happiness known as summer. Can't wait.  Listen to H.I.M.
