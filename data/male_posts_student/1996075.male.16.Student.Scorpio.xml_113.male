And how can we hope for no hard feelings?  We built this together and now we're pulling down together  From different sides of the room  And when this is gone  What else are we gonna do?   We've gotten good at eye contact  While regurgitating lies  Learn to swallow hard so we won't cry  It's been so long since we laughed at the same things  The joke is on me and you  fuck everything  I wonder who will be the first to quit
