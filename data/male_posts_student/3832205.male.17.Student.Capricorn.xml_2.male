Some things got drilld in my head, thanks for nothin kevin, and some things were said at the time by her, that didnt help. I dont know, some may say I am getting worked up over nothing, but what they consider nothing I consider everything. They have no idea how soon my time is comign to an end, and how much all this means to me.         Maybe things will work out, maybe not. Once again thanks Kevin for the supporting words... not.
