The medicated state of mind Things i try to get everything i know of you out of my mind Searching, keep searching till ur completely blind All of my time spent on things such as you, it's ardous Bottled up inside this feeling of angst, must read Dr. Seuss To clear my head and spark a fire, what do i have to lose? Completely oblivious to my surroundings, my options to choose Dangling on a fine piece or thread, my head it rests Wondering about the day after come, should i take these tests You cut me up, I'm wide awake lying on a pile of pests That gnaw at my skin, the medicated state of mind, am i so blessed?
