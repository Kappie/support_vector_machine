Tuesday: I woke up and read a heart-warming e-mail from a good friend.  I replied, then sc/msn to lunch.  Ate something, played CS, then took a shower and went to work.  Immediately after arriving at work 7 mins late >. Afterwards i went home, played sc and went to bed.  LOL, weirdest thing happened.  I make my nightly prayers in bed (when i remember >. I usually listen to music after my prayers too.  I've always had an admiration for the creativity of rappers, and i started going through my few rap songs listening for particularliy good lyrics... Here's what i remember (excuse the language):  Lloyd Banks - Warrior  "Uh, You heard right mothafucka  My grandmama' daughter ain't raised no sucker  Heart full of pride and a head full of anger  Attitude of a winner infared for the danger  Even the paranoya of a female'll change ya  Waking up every morning laying next to a stranger  I'm on the move, smooth, with one eye out for the snakes  Who can't stand hearin your name all throughout the states  Tune into BET and watchin your video  Pretending to be your friends but the smart ones really no, so  If that's your man warn him  'Cause there's enough bullets in here to hit every NBA patch on him "  Nuff said, Lloyd Banks is crazy!!! I esp enjoyed the part about the NBA patches.  For those of u who don't know, about a year ago (in Canada at least), somebody made a jean outfit wit patches from every NBA team... it consists of a jacket and jeans.  This is a good lyric cuz it not only sounds good (dl that song), but it also shows that he truly knows whats going on in the "hood".  Fat Joe  Terror squad - Lean back  "Like my necklace, started relaxin' now, that's what the **** I call a chain reaction."  Self explanitory, though it was ripped from another artist, Jay-Z i think...  Kanye West - Jesus Walks  "I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way yall need Jesus So here go my single dog radio needs this They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes But if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh? Well let this take away from my spins Which will probably take away from my ends Then I hope this take away from my sins And bring the day that I'm dreaming about Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out (Jesus walks)"  True, isn't it?  Finally, i feel asleep.  Today: woke up, read another heart-warming email from a friend.  It took me till 11:5? to reply, and i was supposed to be at the court at 12.  So i didn't eat lunch and went straight to the court.  As soon as i stepped out, i noticed that it just rained.  I was like, "God, plz dont ruin my ball game on my only day off this week...".  When i got on the court, i noticed that it was slowly drying, so i helped it out by kicking out those puddles so that they can dry faster.  After like 20 mins or so of shooting around, Simey and Caspy arrived, shortly followed by Jan, Koo and AP.  We played 3on3, me and the Szymcak bros gainst Jan, Koo and AP.  We won twice i believe... or maybe 1 long one.  But during the last or only game, Kendra appeared and stretched out as we finished the game.  But now we had 7 ppl, so i called up Nick.  He arrived, quicker than usual, and we ran 4on4: Me, Kendra, Nick  Jan vs Koo, AP, Simey and Caspy.  We won once.  Then i went to the fountain, noticed that the drain was being clogged by a plastic bag, drenched my shoes as i fetched it out and let it drain so that it could regain its sprayful glory.  Returned to the game, won again.  Jason arrived mid game and Koo subbed out for him (what a nice guy).  After that game the fountain was its usual self.  So i ran in and drenched my face and hair.  O man doing that in the hot sun (which came out, Thanks God) is priceless...  then we played our last game.  It was intense.  We started hot, but then the other team came back.  At this point i was exhausted, but i forced myself to D up and crash some boards.  I missed so many lay-ups... i HATE missing them, i dont care if their whole team is on me, no excuse... anyways, after a bit, my friend hit game winner from past 3 pt.  As soon we won i ran straight to that fountain, and drenched my face again.  Usually i sit at the side after, but instead i sat right where the water lands after being sprayed.  LOL, i was drenched from head to toe at the end,  but it felt sooooo good.  All my friends were looking at me funny, but it was cuz they were too shy to join me.  I had such a good time, not just cuz of the ball, but cuz i got to chill wit my friends who i prolly wont see very much in the summer.... (reminisces... feels sad... wishes it didnt have to end...) We gotta do that again sometime!! :D  Afterwards, me and Nick went to the store and got a drink.  We both got a Grace brand pineapple juice.  If u ever see it get one, they're the best!!!  It's a jamacain style drink, good stuff.  We payed a dollar, but i seen some other places for less.  they taste so good, and are healthy than pop. When i got home, i gave my friend a cd i never listened to, and took a nice long shower.  I love taking a shower, esp when i have my fav song to sing to playing.  Ya know what else is good, the occasional icy blasy of water after playing ball.  It feels so good... for a moment, then its too cold and the hot water comes back.  After ending it with some soothing cool water, i got out, got into some dry underwear ^.^, and started this blog.  My family got some $50 dollar coupon to Tucker's Marketplace, so halfway through this i left, got some food, returned... and here i am... finished!! :D
