I was 5 minutes late, and after class Mr V quite plainly stated, "You don't need to make up any class time because you're such a great guy."  Awesome.  Thats what... 5 tardies?  Woot.  Work.  meh.  Constipation.  Ugh.   Smelly?  You bet.  http://www.myspace.com/themetalshow  Go there and listen to Dear Dave 1, its about the megadeth boards and how hilarious the guys on there are.
