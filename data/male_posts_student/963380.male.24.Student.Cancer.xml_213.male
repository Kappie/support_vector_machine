In short, the jet-skiing was fun. I will buy one of these.  The weekend went well, I enjoyed it. It looks as if the SuperUser(tm) community will actually mean something. I brought up several concerns that were addressed immediately, I nearly fell out of my chair on that one.  I managed to catch a cold - my throat hurts. Yesterday was the left side, today is the right. I'm glad my throat is an equal opportunity purveyor of pain.  I've been watching a lot of Bruce Timm's Batman: The Animated Series. It's nearly 12 years old - I had no idea. It's gorgeous. I love it.  That's all for now.
