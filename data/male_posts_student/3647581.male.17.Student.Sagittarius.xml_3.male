Well let me start by saying today was eventful...It started last night I slept till about 2:00 a.m  then off I went to go see my "girlfriend"(the quotation marks are there because I think the title is cliche, and needs a more proper name) it was hectic a 30 minute walk to the edge of the other side of town where I risked getting beheaded by Heather's(my girlfriends name is Heather more on her later) soulless vicious mother or arrested the two are both equally terrifying! I made it wow it was a step and a drudge a step and a drudge the whole way, i first had to get past the hounds now and into the dim room which nestled a heavenly body of which i was more than willing to hold. Anyway in and out by 6:00 we spent the night listening to Bright Eyes first full length effort "Fevers and Mirrors" it set the mood for a night full of all sorts of marvelous things. Needless to say neither of us had a full nights rest knowing all to well we had to wake up in about an hour to attend prison i mean summer school but hey we had fun and cherished every moment. I headed back to my aunts as soon as possible where i arrived at 6:32 exactly and slept till 8:00. Now time for school which was fun and full of all sorts of little twists and turns of which I have no passion of typing every single event. So it was all gravy a good day today heather, school, and an evening of boxing my friends for fun and getting the shit knocked out of me. Well that was today in short... But something still troubles me and my mind will not rest until I have someone I can complain to all about how im too jealous and worry about heather spending more time with her friend josh than me. Of course she's grounded from me and anything rob so I guess she has no choice I guess I just wish I made her as happy as he does or at least was there for her but Satan#2 makes that impossible(cute nickname for a older mom type huh?). So I guess ill just call up an old buddy to help me through these times of adolescent wonder, and jealousy. By the way nonantiestablishmentarianism(I think that's the way its spelled, shit I hope that's even the right word) is the longest word in the dictionary...Thanks Johnny what would I do without a friend who can debate politics and chug a beer in the same sit in.
