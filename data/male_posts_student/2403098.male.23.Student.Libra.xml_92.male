I want to relax on the couch before I go to the gym and just watch some TV.  I was fooled into thinking this would be a good idea by the two episodes of the Simpson's that I visually consumed.  Suddenly, out of NO where, the viewing options have DISAPPEARED as if David Copperfield (total douchebag by the way) performed some sort of magic trick on my TV wherein everything interesting VANISHED.  There is now a selection of shit to watch.  They seriously are playing Where The Heart Is, AGAIN, on TV. First time around, sure, it was feel-good and tolerable.  Lauren HATES this movie so much that it's almost funny and I must admit I'm not that far behind at this point.  They play the damn thing on TV probably once every 20 minutes.  Natalie Portman's horrible accent coupled with the plot that involves more peril than is even believable, give lauren and I PLENTY of laughs.  I think we actually had an entire phone conversation the other night dedicated to just how horrible the movie really is.  The bad accents, the unrealistic tornado scene, a character named "Forney" (*ahem* cation?), etc.  Ripping the movie apart and laughing about it with lauren turned a movie that was completely benign in my mind into an evil enemy that I now hate.  And by hate I mean LOVE to hate.  and by love i mean GET IT AWAY from me, I hate it, but let me make fun of it.  Natalie Portman's character would have surely killed herself after all the peril present in that plot.  Shrek 2, I REALLY wanna see.  That movie looks great.  I can watch Where The Heart Is or a music video channel based in Canada called FUSE that is dedicating the next hour entirely to music by Incubus (sorry guys, just not a huge fan), or frickin TRL on MTV.  None of these options appeal to me.   One thing that they do like to show a lot of on MTV are the "Truth" commercials about smoking.  Light me and smoke me if I'm wrong, but aren't these commercial irritating?  I think they are.  I don't smoke and I personally don't even care to have smoking in public places either.  I do, however, despise the Truth commercials.  I want to punch people in the back that lay mannequins all over the streets of NYC in order to prove a point related to how many people die from cigarette smoke every year.  I guess it sends a good message to youth, but don't tell me how your grandma is a martyr because she chose to smoke.  Deaths due to smoking = sad.  Marketing to children by "Big tobacco" = bad too.  Claiming you didn't know any better by inhaling smoke into your lungs and then blaming it on someone else = annoying.  Shave your head in public to protest cigarettes if you want, but the bitch couldn't have thought smoking was healthy.  SORRY.  These chics don't even know the name of my band.. but they're all on me like they wanna hold hands... oops where was I...  I'm so happy it's Friday:)  OH OH OH 3 minutes until Where The Heart Is comes on!  "You hear that?  That lil' bomp bomp bomp.. that's where the heart is."  Shut up Natalie, just SHUT UP! I wish you had fallen through the hole in your boyfriends' car instead of your flip flops.  That would have made for a better plot.  HA!
