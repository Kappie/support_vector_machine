I have about 12.5 days left and im at the borderline between getting straight As or as, and Bs its just really dumb how at the end of the year your grade depends on the last project and all ur thinking about is getting out. And then there is another year...my god i dont even wanna go to school next year i cant wait until college and moving out and being on my own for once...arg neway enough of my bitching.  today at work was good all except for that stupid Dan guy but other then that it went well. I got alot done, i got my two good friends a job Chels, and Jean. Learned that my sister got a raise, and i got a raise and got promoted to night manager, all in all not bad somehow i feel very accomplished it feels cool to say im a night manager. And another raise should be coming soon. I love it. I like being good friends with my manager. I have 34 text messages from her and ive only been thier for about two weeks i havent even got a pay check yet. granted i've quit twice and i've really been working thier for over a year. Its still cool iono thats going good.   and tommorow NO SCHOOL its not like i wont be doing anything for it but at least im not going to be thier. Then its just SATs on the 5th and try to get a 4.0 next year both semesters then off to Fresno State so that i can march the bulldog marching band w/ Chris, Jon, Kendall, and Christina, fun fun.   I think thats all i have to talk about, cept IM A SECOND BARI NOW, o yea and Bass section leader in choir, o and Drum section leader in band, wow i feel really accomplished. finally people recognize my hard work.
