A studio version of "Not Afraid" has just been released. All I have to say is "Amazing." It will send chills down your spine! Hopefully I will soon be able to get a mp3 available for download. Until then here is a link to the lyrics for  urlLink "Not Afraid" . Until Next Time, Good morning, good evening, and good night. signing off: Ghostmanon3rd
