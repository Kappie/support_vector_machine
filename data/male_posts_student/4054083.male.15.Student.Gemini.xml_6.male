Well, not immediately cuz it was cool to see her again, and we started getting along well... but then she kinda blew the night. She was complaining, then at the end, she like... jogged off away from us, to go home, and didnt even tell us she was going, then I had to chase her, and then some rfucking woman thought we were trying to rape her, and we got stopped by her... and just... Lindsey said some stuff that was just fuckin rude, and it got to me. Was something like "Well, this was a fun night", even before the old chick stopped us.
