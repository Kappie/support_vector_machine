Ur eyes seemed to be ogling on him throughout the match.    Cheryl Fox: U noticed that too? The  SP goalie was wearing 2 G-strings outside his pants. weird huh? And the protection he was wearing looked like a tank top.  That was a really refreshing experience.     Reporter: That must have turned u on yeah? haha...    Cheryl Fox: Well, SP's no.18 is pretty sexy too. He's name is akil ryt? he's butt has got to be one of the sexiest. I'm probably got the nominate him for it on the next issue of FHM.
