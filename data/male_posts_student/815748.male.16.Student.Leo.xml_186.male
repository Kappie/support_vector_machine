    
       Just a few days until I leave.  Saturday's the "build-up day," so Friday's my last full day here.  I'm kinda looking forward to it; the experience, anyway.  Not the people, for the most part.  I don't know whether I'll be able to send postcards when I'm there.  If I can, I'll try to do so.  And I won't make the mistake I made in France.  Bill Nye is too a real science guy, not an actor.  And it turns out my dad didn't meet him.  I must have been thinking of something else.
