Or, a fireman. Unfortunately I believe that overwhelming majority of people grew up in houses where parents did something shitty, see part time retail, or something really boring, see account executive or CPA. Before we truly understand the value of money, despite what anyone says a person does not learn the value of money until he or she pays his or her own bills, we cannot associate "what do we want to be when we grow up" with a lucrative title. So what happens to us? We wake up one day when we're 18, when we're 22, when we're 38, when we're 64 and we realize that STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK WE WANT TO DO WITH OUR LIVES. I'm trying to decide what's worse for me right now. Coming to grips with the fact that I may not have the smarts, money, family, ambition, work ethic to achieve my dreams or if I never really had a dream to begin with. Tomorrow will I wake up as a failure or just another tax payer who likes to treat himself to hot wings once in a while? That'll give you some insomnia.  This is a week of lists... (Bare with me) Ten Must-See Drug Movies  1. Trainspotting. Sick, funny, morbidly fascinating. Who could have guessed that Ewan McGregor would become a heartthrob? 2. Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. Hands down, the absolute funniest movie I have ever seen. And true. Sure, it is. 3. The Basketball Diaries. Harrowing autobiographical tale of a descent into depravity. Leonardo DiCaprio is riveting. 4. Less Than Zero. One of Robert Downey Jr.'s best performances ever. Too bad it was prophetic. 5. Blow. OK, I haven't seen it yet. But it's a true story, it sounds good, and I adore the guy who plays Tuna in it. 6. Homegrown. Jon Bon Jovi, Ryan Philippe and weed. You'll love it. 7. Up In Smoke. Cheech and Chong at their funniest, driving a van built of pot. We watch this about once a week. 8. Bongwater. I put this on here as a joke. There's no way I could watch a movie with Jack Black, Andy Dick and Jamie Kennedy in it. 9. Valley Of The Dolls. Drug abuse, circa 1967. Sharon Tate's only starring role, just two years before her murder by Charles Manson. 10. Reefer Madness. Made in 1938, this movie used to be required viewing in schools. Did you know marijuana use leads to insanity?!?! Best watched stoned.
