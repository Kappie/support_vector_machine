The thoughts that bounce around that cage And keep you in a constant rage, You never even stopped to wonder, where in hell you were. Though peices of your minds desire, wander alone amongst the fire, that burns around the clock through a window in your head. Waves upon your shattered dreams, Where fear lies in between the seams Where reality is begining to come undone.   That's an old one, but it's one of my favorites. Seemingly odd that nobody reads this. Well, maybe the crazy friend. I wodner if I should start linking people.
