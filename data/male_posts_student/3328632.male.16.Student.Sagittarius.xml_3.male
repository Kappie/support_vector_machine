I don't want to have to analyze what makes their lives so sorrowful, i just want them to get over their bitch-ass-ness.  Also I'm tired of this book, and in general I am tired of assigned reading, as i feel it interrupts my more focused literal pursuits.  In any case, please excuse the hypocritical bitch-ass-ness of this post. Rip out (pout).
