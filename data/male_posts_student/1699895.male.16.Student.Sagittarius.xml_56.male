Its fuckinsummer biotch!!  There is one thing I am wondering about....  I don't really know if I am going to be playing soccer for CHS next year.  For one, I can tell Frieds (the varsity coach) hates me, or at least doesnt like me.  plus he already has two goalies, i don't think it would even be worth trying out.  but yea, i got to mow the lawn, ttyl
