I feel good not because something good happened to me, but because I helped something good happen to someone else. If you know what I am talking about, then you know how good the feeling is. I won't get into any detail on how i helped this person, because it would be untrustworthy of me to tell you all, and frankly, it doesn't really matter what happened. It is that it is fixed that is important now.  This is the first time in a long time I have felt really good about myself. I think the only way to keep myself happy like like I am now is to help  myself  now. Most of my blogs have been rather negative lately. Why that is, again, is not as important as to how I can invert my attitude. I am going to make a huge attempt, no, I'm  going  to turn myself around.   I remember back in the day, back in an undefined time a few years ago, it was so easy to have fun with my friends. We could have fun mainly because none of us cared what anybody else thought about us. We could have fun poking people with sporks at the lunch table, for crying out loud. These days,I am having trouble concentrating, finding something to say in a conversation, making common bonds between me and my friends. I have a hard time laughing at jokes that I should roll on the floor laughing for. I need to get back to the point where I was back in those good old days.. more secure, more sure of myself. I am going to start living life in a much happier manner, starting by making back some of the friends I have lost (or who have lost me) in the past few months.    Happiness, they say, is not a place but a destination. I am sure going to start heading that way, and with a little help from all of you, maybe that can happen. A journey like this one is not unique to me, it can be done and it has been done many times before. But never before has anyone completed this arduous task without the support of their friends. It gets easier and easier with every friend that you have there to help you. So please, please, please, help me out.
