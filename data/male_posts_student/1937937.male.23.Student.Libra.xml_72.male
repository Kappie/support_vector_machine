He was a fellow fan of my father's writing, and he hosted what's called a "BBS".  That stands for  B ulletin  B oard  S ystem.  "High school is like the training wheels for the bicycle of life."   Now, for important things: this.  Many of you have been coming to me and asking, "What's the deal with Soul Patch, Rob?"  To them, I say this:  The Soul Patch is an essential ingredient to many varying facial hair structures.  For instance, it is integral to  The Flying W , which is pictured below.   Okay, I thought there could be more fun there, but it really got old fast.  Apparently, The Soul Patch is not as funny as it sounds.  But let me say that I am indebted to  urlLink Creep Guirdo  and his little friend  urlLink jose .  I call him little because he doesn't capitalize his name.  Carissa is watching  urlLink Ghost World  with the dark but mildly good looking  urlLink Thora Birch .  You probably remember her from her masterful performances as Sally Ryan in the Tom Clancy blockbusters  Patriot Games  and  Clear and Present Danger .  So back to Eric.  On BBSess there were "sysops" --  sys tem  op erator s .  I was one of them, but before that, Eric was.  And I chatted with him for several days (or possibly weeks) about the traumas of being 13, and I think he was very understanding.  "That says so much about who I am, and what it feels like to inhabit my specific skin."
