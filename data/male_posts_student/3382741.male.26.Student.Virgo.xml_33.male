It was only about an hour long nap, but that was enough. Now I can't sleep. I know it's a combination of the nap and hyperness about my interview tomorrow. The more I think about it the more I want to get this job. I am almost certain that I will be able to go to school part time still and it will likely be free. If it's free that would be more than great for me.  David comes home tomorrow (thurs [today technically]). I am really looking forward to seeing him. This has been by far the longest we have gone without seeing each other since we met. We have talked some everyday he's been gone tho. I am really missing him and it's obvious that he feels the same. I went to look at the deplex we are thinking about renting today. It's prety nice tho it needs a little TLC. The rooms are spacous and the whole layout is very open. The place would make an interesting house if the two sides were joined together (I got to see both sides of the place). I am anxious to see what comes of that.  I am still playing EQ. It's almost an obsesion, but nothing like it was before. If I could get my friend that I used to play with back on then there would be a lot more that we could do and more fun playing. I refuse to let it consume me like it used to tho. I can walk away from it prety easy now. I barely played any at all today simply becuase I didn't feel like playing. There is also a good chance that we won't have internet for a while when we move (unless I do get this job then everything changes), so if we don't that will force a sabatical (sp?) from EQ anyway.  BLAH .... I need to sleep.  There are a lot of movies that I still want to see. Wish I had the money to go (and someone to go with me). Friday David and I are going to have dinner at my friend's house. Her name is Kristin and I have known her since I was in middleschool. She is a really nice girl and a lot of fun. She could talk a three toed sloth into a stuppor (sp?) tho. I love her to death. She is very open and candid and I like those kind of people. It will be the first "social" event David and I have done together as a couple.  Oh well guess I don't have anything else to say right now.
