Called: "Gaming skills you shouldn't use in real life"  heres some of the funny bits I can be bothered to copy.  (flying planes) "Airlines also get funny about other people flying their planes, and passengers tend to spend less on duty-free perfume if they hear "Stall, stall, stall!" and "Pull up, terrain!!" too many times."  (strafing) "Do NOT strafe the postman. Do NOT sidestep around the corners of buildings."  (winning the Tour de France) "No matter how hard you pedal, no matter how many water bottles you throw over your own head and face, the motorcycle cameraman always wins. Bastard."  That'll do for now. Maybe more stuff later if I can be bothered.
