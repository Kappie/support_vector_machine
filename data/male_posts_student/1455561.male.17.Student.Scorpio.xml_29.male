No ones giving me an award.  Someone young goes to a few gigs and you cant award him enough, i sit here listening to old radiohead albums and get completely ignored.  hypocrites.  Dont you feel sorry for him having to write a media studies essay, whilst i'm stuck here trying to draw Transchloroethyne  just cos he manages to blog a few times a week and i can barely type long enough to make some half arsed attempt to make my life sound interesting once a month.  Maybe i'll start going to a few gigs here in gloucestershire: i hear The Wurzels are playing in the local barn.  Is that what you want? an in depth discussion on how making the stage out of hay was genius? No, exactly, so dont make me.  Im sure he finds plenty of time inbetween talking about films and trying to touch ryan adams to do his blog, i have sitting down to do, not to mention all that "work" on the xbox.  What kind of a hat-wearing Nathan Barley spends all his time with friends going out and having fun?  All i'm asking is for an award to go to the bloggers who truly suffer for their art and are afflicted with the terrible diseases of lazyness and greed.
