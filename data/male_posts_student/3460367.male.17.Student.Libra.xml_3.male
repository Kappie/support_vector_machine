Then I fixed the weedwacker which took a good half-hour.  Grandpa showed up to pick it up then I went to brownick to mow.  The mower was totally screwed up.  So mi padre y yo fuimos a casa.  We loaded our mower into the truck (it didn't really fit so that was a fun ride.)  I mowed Brownick then went to Liverpool looking for Kyle.  Didn't see him there.  Drove over to his house didn't see him there either.  Drove by Wegmans saw his car there.  All totaled there were a lot of bodies from all my driving by.  I came home then I decided to kill myself... 9 miles!  I ran it in 69 minutes too.  Which for you humanities majors is 7:40 miles.  Then I came home and ate dinner (Fillet Mignon :-).)  Kyle dropped by before dinner.  I went over around 7 to help him fix up the yard.  Afterwards we played ping-pong for a bit.  Then I came home and I'm writing here.  Oh yeah I only have to do 55 pushups and then I have met my 1K goal for this week.  So now I'm talking to Jill and relaxing.  I really love talking to Jill.  For her age she is shockingly mature.  I really like it.  She is a really good friend.  But off to bed now!  Work tomorrow.
