We just went out to lunch and stuff. Seems like they're "popular abercrombie people." Oh well. rar they have my screen name and my cell phone number so i'm supposedly going to be hanging out with them a few times before school starts. Somehow it seems like being friends with them could get interesting...and of course as usual i miss you guys! Can't wait to see my Alex on monday!        ~Christy
