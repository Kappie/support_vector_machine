Across Iraq it was one of the bloodiest days this year for the occupation. Five US soldiers also died in Habbaniya, 15 miles west of Falluja, when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb. Near the southern city of Basra, three British soldiers were injured when they were caught in an explosion." Two Days Earlier... "Bush put on a slide show, calling it the "White House Election-Year Album" at the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association 60th annual dinner, showing himself and his staff in some decidedly unflattering poses.  There was Bush looking under furniture in a fruitless, frustrating search. "Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere," he said. " I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  Bush keeps amazing me with the absolute lack of any sort of tact whatsoever.  Uh, Mr. "President", PEOPLE DIED FOR YOUR BULLSHIT WAR YOU ASSHOLE.  PEOPLE ARE STILL DYING.  IT ISN'T FUCKING FUNNY.    He starts a war for no good reason, gets 500+ American soldiers killed, 3,400+ wounded, 9,000 Iraqi citizens die, and he fucking  jokes  about it? Kerry, you had better kick the living shit out of this dickhead in November.  This kind of crap makes my soul hurt; I don't want anybody else to lose their life because we have an idiot flipping the switches.     urlLink First Story     urlLink Second Story
