Today I had to get up at *yawn* 7:30, which is not exactly fun happy party times. Eventually I ended up at the tennis courts and it was almost time for my first match, semi-finals YAY! go me :D. It was against Jack Fletcher, who I like playing against because we are almost even in strength and he is not very serious when he plays so we can make jokes and kinda just play around. Jack ended up winning the game, but meh... 'cause it was a fun match. Then.... I waited for about 4 hours until my doubles game, I'm just gonna blame that whole game on my partner Nick.    I then flew home on my banana fueled rocket pickle and went "gobble gobble" to the food and then went upstairs and on to the computer. BJ then asked me if I wanted to play crackwarz (Warcraft 3), and I eventually said yes. lol we completely won the game that we played, then I got off......... and we talked about going to the pool tomorrow. Wes says he has to do "stuff" as usual, but he said he might come but I don't think he will. I'll probably end up going to BJ's tomorrow and playing Tales of Symphonia.    Random stuff I forgot to mention:  Me and BJ played this Magic: The Gathering online type game thingy, and after I figured out how to get it to work we played a game. I lost horribly because I had nothing that I could possibly use in my hand. Then in the next game I used a different deck and I killed him.... MWAHAHAHA!!!    While I was playing the Magic online game thingy Cookie was talking to me and telling me about her new shirts that she got. lol and she "got" a care bears t-shirt, and I say "got" because she just wrote "care bears" on a piece of paper and put it on her shirt.... but it still makes me jealous.... because I love anything to do with Care Bears.
