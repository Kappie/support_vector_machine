And she again was like you'll have to see and i was like yeah, i was tempted to put the name of my teacher Mr hebert on it and put it on his desk, so he could think it was for him, but i was like better not, i don't want to be that mean, he hasn't done anything to prevoke me like other teachers who have been complete asses twards me. I actually avoided the whole my # is..... becouse she got of topic and started asking me questions such as where were you born.....e.t.c, anyway im actually almost done with my report ive done an out line all io have to do is put in the right order and use a million words for like one word, since it has to be 750 words minimun and 4 pages long. and i also have a states capitols test to take that day when i turn it in(the report), i actually know the states i just don't know all the capitols i know some, like most of the southern capitols I just realized i have a bad habitt of using the word     like   I sound like poeple from the valley, well no i don't i just have a habit of using the word like but not the phrase  like oh my god
