THANK GOD!.... now normally i don't look forward to haircuts with excitement, but i feel like someone took a dog (the long haired kind) shot it and stuck it to my head........ the amount of hair on top of my skull is overwhelming..... im not used to it and can't wait to cut it all off..... with that said i am going to end this entry..... talk to you later
