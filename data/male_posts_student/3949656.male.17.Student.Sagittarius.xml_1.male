There are no imperfections, the image is either perfect, or non-existant. Windows will appear anywhere, they may be extra unusual items on the mantle-piece up to entire sides of buildings changing into a rolling green pasture. Those on the other side of a window (if any) will not be able to see into the CW universe, and neither side can travel between universes with the windows.
