Woke up at 10ham with an incredible headache, also i did a nightmare i don't fully remember, it involved something like being trapped, anyway i am the champion of nightmares that makes no sense.   Played a bit more of  Homeworld II  Demo, fucked my game completely because i somehow activated an unknown feature of the game (Well, it's not in the tutorial), that was the waypoint mode. I will probably try to master it later on.    Julien  is angry at is parents because they control is money, well the money he wins when he works.   Nothing else to say i guess, except 6 days! The furnitures that were suppose to arrive today appearently didn't, who know why?  Regards,  Zephyr
