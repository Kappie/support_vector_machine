All i did all day was macro mining because i felt like making some money so i could fill some deeds and then make money from getting the hammers that you get from deeds.  I went to my friend roberts house today it was pretty awesome.  We watched tons of futurama episodes from dvd and then played on comps.  Then we went in the other room to watch a freaking pauly shore movie.  We watched son-in-law.  It was freaking awesome bu-uddy hahahaha oh pauly shore.  Then i went home only to continue macroing in UO.  Wow not much to write about today amazingly.  I am thinking of emailing Michael Moore to tell him i really enjoyed his film Farhenheit 9/11 and tell him about my likes and dislikes of the presedential campaigns even though i am not even American.  You would be very surprised how will a 14 year old like me can follow the news with the internet haha.  I keep track of everything new.  Well cant wait to hang out with friends tomorrow.
