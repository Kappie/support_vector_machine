(subliminal message) sign with the warriors! (/subliminal message)   o yeaa, on another note...charlotte bobcats what the FORK. i've lost all respect for their naming crew, and i don't even kno them. and no more HSEE! the july test was canceled, and cuz they'll say kids didn't have all chances possible to make it up it will prolly be removed as a graduation requirement for 2004. who cares, we all passed anyway haha.   ...didn't we?
