Anyway, I got up at the butt crack of dawn this morning to take my dad to the airport. No, it wasn't to be nice. It was so i could drive his X-terra. Woo.  My ADD brain is moving so fast this morning. New subject. I need to go get my hair cut, but the mofo's over at Antione Du Chez won't answer their phone. Alright. It's 9:23 right now. I'm trying again. So, I didn't get throught to an actual person until 9:26. And I had to listen to classical music the whole time. Eww. But, hey. I have an appointment for 11:15. Yeah.  Hmmm...That was odd. It sounded like there was a Jack Johnson song on that Oreo commercial. I would cry if someone as cool as Jack ever did a commercial.   Alright. Its time for me to do something productive. By that I mean stop writing in my blog and watch TV. Hehe. Later.
