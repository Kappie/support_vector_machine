Then I went to VB, and up until today the internet didn't get fixed.  Whatever, I'm happy with how things are.  My schedule kicks ass (Only 8 periods!) and I have 7th Lunch again (Allah Akbar!).  Not like anyone really cares.  I'm just ramabaling, because I'm a narcissist, or however that crap is spelled.
