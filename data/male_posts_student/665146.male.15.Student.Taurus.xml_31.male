I'm so sorry...  I woke up with chicken hangover in my uncle's room (no, he wasn't there...).  I had to be there because I couldn't sleep in the same room as Joe: The Amazing Insomniac.  After fighting off my returning sleep, I went into my room........where everyone else was.  We played Grand Theft Auto 3 for a while, and soon, AJ left.  Joe was supposed to leave, but we were all addicted to GTA3, especially Joe ("I'll leave in five minutes").  After everyone was gone, except Nora, well, most of the day was a blur of TV, video games, and computer crap.  Around 6, my dad kicked us out, so we went to the park and played basketball.  Any third party looking at us was laughing to a coma.  I hope they never come out of it.  The rest of the night was just like most of the day, and now you've read this shit as I'm writing it.  I'm really sorry.....  If I ever think of anything good to write, I'll do it.........
