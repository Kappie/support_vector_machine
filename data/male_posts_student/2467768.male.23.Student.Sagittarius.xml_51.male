We travelled a few places, jokes around, spending the time of the greatest.  7 minutes laters, they will be on the country train to Melbourne. I was planning to join the crew, but budget was my limit. I really fell heavy to reject join them.  I am really appreciate, with Rossman staying over my place for the last 3 nights. I do enjoyed cooking for them, Lemak Chilli Padi and Chilli Honey Chicken. Usually, I only chat with him thru the net, but now, we jokes and teased each other. I didn't know this pray would grant him  Sharizan, a great hilarious bloke. I didn't know he is from NYP too. Cool, power... At least, we have something in common to chat about NYP life ... And jokes too at nite.  Guys, I you really read this .. I really have a great time here ... I really enjoy myself. Thanks for comming, and accompony me ... I really appreciated it very much Really going to miss both of you guys. Hopefully, ya back to 'the gong' before leaving for Brisbane.
