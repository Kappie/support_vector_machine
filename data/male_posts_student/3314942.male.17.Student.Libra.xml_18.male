Something is always different about it, and this is what differentiates the past from the future. Perhaps it is the change from WInter to Spring occurring so quickly but recently i have noticed the changes in a million different ways. The sun sets later, and the trees get greener. For some reason these changes on this day struck me more than on others. I mean for christ sake the trees have gone from Bare to fully clothed in less than a week. They are going photosynthesis happy, and the pollen is laid across everything. What, in God's name, do these changes signify? Every year we experience the same change from Winter to Spring to Summer to Fall to winter and to Spring ( a seemingly beautiful movie). But every year is not the same. Trees bloom on different days and with different intensity. I never noticed how major these changes were. I cant remember teh alst time the trees looked so heavy with flowers and so green with life. The better question is why did i write about this? and why would you care about reading it?  Currently Listening to: Jack Johnson Live at the Orpheum
