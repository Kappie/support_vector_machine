I hardly restrained myself from rolling my eyes and sayings something disgraceful...of course, that's just barely worse than when I walked in to the kitchen one day and my Grandma was listening to Rush Limbaugh, so I turn to her and ask, "So you're goin conservative, eh?" (I actually had no idea what her political stances were).  In response, she turns to me and, absolutely honestly and with a straight face, says, "Rush is conservative?"  (insert mournful shaking of head...)
