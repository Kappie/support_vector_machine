That's a pretty cool thing to celebrate. Who knows? Maybe someday we'll abolish neoliberalism and corporations? [!hope]*   In other news, the job market is still  urlLink going to crap :  "The U.S. labour market -- while finally experiencing increases in job creation -- has also seen a dramatic drop in employment quality, with low-paying jobs elbowing aside higher-paying ones, CIBC World Markets said yesterday.  The brokerage's employment quality index -- which measures the overall tone of the market by looking at things such as compensation, job stability and the mix of full-time and part-time employment -- fell by eight points between 2001 and 2004, a decline CIBC called dramatic.  The slide occurred largely because of the "swapping of high-paying for low-paying jobs" with gains coming from traditionally lower-paying sectors like hospitality and education, while better-paying jobs in areas such as transportation, manufacturing and natural resources disappeared, CIBC said.  The brokerage also found that the average wage in sectors that gained jobs over the past three years was 30 per cent lower than the average wage in industries that lost jobs. ... "The message is clear," CIBC World Markets economist Benjamin Tal said. "The vast majority of jobs that evaporated during the 'job-loss' recovery were high-quality jobs.""  Those are definitely surefire signs of the distribution of wealth being less equitable. There is a decline in decent paying jobs which is of course accompanied by the increase in low-paying jobs while the CEOs seem to be getting raises. Wait? Is that even news? It's been happening for a while now. Also, my friend showed me this cool  urlLink graph  the other day that basically shows how, even though the minimum wage has gone up recently, the value in actual dollars has been in steady decline or stagnation since 1978 due to inflation, and has in fact only increased by one penny since 1955.   P.S. Tomorrow marks the 13th anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis in North America. That game pwns!  *mad homage to  urlLink sean , by the way
