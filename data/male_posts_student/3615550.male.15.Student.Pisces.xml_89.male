If you're the curious type, you have probably clicked on it to see what the heck it was about. If you haven't, or if you just didn't get it, I thought I'd take a little time to explain it.  The "The Truth Laid Bear Ecosystem" is a directory of blogs that ranks blogs by inbound links. Your ranking improves by the number of other blogs that link to you, provided the other blogs are in the Ecosystem. That means that if someone links to you, but they aren't in the Ecosystem, that link won't be counted toward your ranking. I noticed that  urlLink Laura  has already joined the Ecosystem.  Anyway, I just thought it would be a neat way to see how I rank in the blogosphere. If you want to add your blog to the Ecosystem, just click  urlLink here , and remember that the more inbound links you get, the higher your ranking will be.  Be blessed! Neo
