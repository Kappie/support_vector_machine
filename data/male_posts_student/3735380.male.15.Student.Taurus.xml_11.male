When I was watching a chess game at chess club today, I felt really drowsy and almost fell onto the board.  When I came on the computer screen I felt a tiny bit drowsy.  When I was drinking milk out of the carton, I almost fell down and slept on the floor in the kitchen. Weird. Luckily no milk was spilled.  The last time I did that recently was when I was watching TV. I felt extremely tired and would've fallen asleep if the vacuum wasn't turned on.  Weird, huh? And the most recent 3 happened within an hour.  I guess that's because I had to get up at 7:30  Note to self: Never ever ever wake up earlier than you can take. Note to self: Add 6 hours and 30 minutes to sleep time.
