Dennett’s thesis was to show how Darwin made metaphysical naturalism to be an intellectually compelling position.  Reppert’s book draws on C. S. Lewis (mainly from his work Miracles) to show that metaphysical naturalism cannot comfortably claim to possess rationality.  His argument could go something like this:   1.  If naturalism is true, then human brains are the result of accidental, purposeless physical forces.  2.  If human brains are the result of accidental, purposeless forces, then they cannot be trusted to acquire true beliefs.  3.  Therefore, if naturalism is true, then human brains cannot be trusted to acquire true beliefs.  4.  Therefore, if naturalism is true, then it entails the self-refuting claim that we cannot trust our brains to tell us it is true. This is a very watered-down version of what Reppert calls the Argument from Reason.  In his book he goes in much more detail, and shows other compelling reasons to doubt metaphysical naturalism possesses a robust metaphysical framework to uphold rationality.  Consequently, he has gone under fire from the  urlLink Internet Infidels .  He must have done something right because in turn Richard Carrier wrote a  urlLink lengthy response , which is full of the usual rhetoric and often imprecise thinking that is common to the Internet Infidels.  Fortunately, some theists have begun to fight back.  For example, Bill Vallicella has posted  urlLink a response on his blog .  I haven’t had time to pour carefully over Carrier’s response and write my own rebuttal (yet).  I believe Reppert is on to something dangerous, though, and the naturalists know it.  Reppert struck a chord, and now the naturalists are fighting back like a cornered animal.  I say, "Good job Victor!"
