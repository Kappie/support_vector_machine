So anyway, last night I raised 290, second highest of the night which is way cool. Supposedly I'm a field manager now, which means I get 50 extra bucks in my pay check but I have to be there at 11:14, instead of 1. Hmmmm. I don't see much of my family anymore, especially my papa, which is kinda weird actually. O! Yesterday we ordered a bunch of stuff that I still need for camping, like a sleeping bag, rain gear, and other whatnot that eludes my memory at the moment.  Cheers
