Some of the homework I actuALly liked! Mr. Nocera, my science teacher, is reALly cool in a 70s kind of way. His homework is reALly easy; I showed it to Jonny's little brother and he said that's the kind of thing he did two years ago! I'm proud of two English assignments I've done, one about seeing "Austin Powers in Goldmember" and one where I had to draw an abstract self-portrait. Ask me if you want to see them. The math was pretty fun, though I forgot a concept we learned last year, which partially impeded my homework. Even so, school so far has been pretty fun.
