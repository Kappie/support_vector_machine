I'll post a more thorough accounting of my actions on a later post.This isjust a quick one to say I've just seen The Cooper Temple Clause at the Fleeceon a warm up for theirAmerican tour.Suffice it to say, they ROCKED! It was they first gig I've been to without earplugs in ages, I left them in Bridgwater, and my ears are ringing like Big Ben. Buggeration.  I suggest that anyone who listens to a lot of live music get some. They are called ER20s you should be able to find them for about Â£12.  Beddybyes.  Tim
