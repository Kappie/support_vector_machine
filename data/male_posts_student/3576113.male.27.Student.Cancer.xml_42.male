Half-ass preparing for the new block season, still need some cards, sucks to not have credit cards at my disposal. Ponderings on this day are out the window, and for once was human children making noise outside. Planning on some beach time in the coming days, must hit the waves at least once. No T.V., isn't the void we feared as missing the daily sports updates ain't that huge. My roommate does demand more prime time computer hours however so the void might be my lack of communication. Not progressing in my novel so much as I'm reading other random stuff and our Munchkin deck has grown considerably as we've filled it in with recent expansions. Silly game we play far too much to be honest, considering others at our disposal which are truly great. Gonna download some more tunes and see about getting this diskchanger filled, it's like an addiction I hear.
