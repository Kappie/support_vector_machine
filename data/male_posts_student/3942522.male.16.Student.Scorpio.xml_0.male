She's also a very resplendent lady with very well structured organs. Not forgetting her smooth and fair complexion which seems so comfortable to touch with. Well, she's also got this very cheerful splendiforous smile which will makes you go "WOW" !! I still remember we used to do stupid things together which led both of us into deepest regrets. Not only that, we sufferred the worst torment no one can ever imagine or go through. Thinking back, I feel so disappointed with myself for living that type of life which I will never want to ever again. Fortunately, we turned more mature and make ourselves a much happily person which we wanted forever. However, we must pay for our sins fora long period of time which affects our lifes severely. We can't blame but to accept with pride. Most people looked down on people like us but people inour circle are very encouraging. They didn't give us up nor dislike us and are even proud of us. That's because we did something most people are unable to. I would rather tell myself that I have gone through more than anyone elses do. Gain an experience and get into a higherlevel of maturity. We seems so near yet so far and now it is getting miles away and away. I can't wait to meet her MY BEST FRIEND again. We share the same problems and understand each other very well. Someday, we will be able to meet again and commemorate that day. Never shall I forget that day and will be looking forward for it.*sad* :(
