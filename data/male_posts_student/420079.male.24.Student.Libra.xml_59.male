A little more milk, a little more sweetener, just a dab of cream and a pinch of real sugar, a dash of vanilla powder and...  LATE FOR CLASS!  And I didn't know whether to come into class late a few minutes late with coffee in hand, or just skip the whole thing. I think I did both, depending on what class it was.  Also, in my dream, I ran into a professor who had selected me for the judicial externship, and I thanked him... he told me the judge's contact info would be sent out soon... and when I checked my e-mail this morning it was there! Ooooooh, spoooooky........  It's nice to see my family but I wish spring break were over so I could return to my palacial abode in Cleveland  :-)
