     
       One More Empty Bottle    The angels have fallen They won't be singing anymore You weren't here with me that time I swear this is where I was before  You won't remember this tomorrow And I won't have the courage to mention These full and empty feelings They'll never come to your attention  One more empty feeling Do I want what I've been thinking Another empty bottle I don't even remember drinking  Perhaps you'll never know my mind The one that every one wants inside That is alright with me, You're the only one from which I hide
