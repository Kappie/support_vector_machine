I have my follow-up on Wednesday so hopefully the doc will have a better combo for me to try..two weeks on this shit and I'm still feeling pretty lousy. Only thing I've experienced so far has been a shitload of sides. This blows.      On the bright side, my workout was pretty good. Worked arms today and was able to push a decent amount of weight. My back still hurts for some reason but hopefully I'll be able to hit legs tomorrow. Last week I damn near puked while doing squats and deads..real cool huh?
