On the other hand, playing Mario Kart Double Dash and Mario Party 5 with your girlfriend till 1:00 in the morning: PRICELESS. Heehee. I feel so exhausted right now. Mainly because of work but also because I only slept for a few hours last night. My girlfriend Gloria and I rented Mario Party 5 and we couldn’t put it down. She’s very competitive it’s hard to put my guard down.  Anyhow, Its almost 4:00 p.m. and I plan to break a new record by sleeping early.  Good think I don’t have to worry about waking up early for work tomorrow morning.  I plan to practice the second movement of the Bach double tomorrow. My recital is only a few weeks away.
