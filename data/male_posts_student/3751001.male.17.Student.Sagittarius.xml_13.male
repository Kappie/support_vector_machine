A online buddy of mine whose name i shall not mention at this time ;-) likes another freind of mine and by "like" i mean the type which is stronger then a freindship.  I'm gonna call, the online buddy X and my other freind who i know from non-online purposes "Y". I've known X for quite a few weeks after being put in several mass coversations together i decided to add her address to my msn list.  Shes not been a happy soul after some recent event which i don't think she will approve of me telling the world. Sorry to bring this issue in again but we trust each other, and by doing this "mission" for her i'm doing her a favour and she is doing something for me.  Y is a guy who i've known for many years, from what i know the pair are good freinds and X wants to go further. As a freind to both i feel its my duty to help them out, it may put a smile on my expressionless face! :-)  As for myself well i'm ok, i'm really really bored but hopefully i'm gonna be seeing vix and chris again to go to Nottingham and this time possibly buy something 8-0. Until then i'll probably blog some more rubbish so bai bai!  ~Atrocity
