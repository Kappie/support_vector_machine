You are a great friend, and it has rocked getting to know you better this summer, and becoming a better friend with you. You are my best friend who is a girl. You rock. From "Red Dot" to "CrzGrl" we've been through alot. I'm so happy that you are going to West Ranch with me, even though it sucks that you won't be going to school with Wes anymore. I can't wait to be in ASB and Video with you next year, and maybe even another class or two. Its fun to watch Family Guy, Whose Line, and Futurama with you (Spot the Star Trek Costumes!). And, well, you just an all around cool, awesome person. :)
