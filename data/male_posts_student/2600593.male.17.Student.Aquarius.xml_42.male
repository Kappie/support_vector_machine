I'll actually comment on each of the stories!  This news preview's news comes from Internet Week.com   1)   urlLink Lycos jumps into the 1GB email market  .  Wow... this is amazing... everybody's getting into "big" storage.  I think Google has everyone's attention, though... I might get a lycos account just for testing purposes ;-)  2)   Cisco leak .   More details about the computer code stolen from Cisco surfaced on Tuesday, including new samples of the source code and information on how the code was distributed, four days after a Russian Web site reported news of the theft and posted sample code ...  3)     urlLink IBM, Cisco Team Up For VoIP   .  VoIP (voice over IP).  This is kinda neat...
