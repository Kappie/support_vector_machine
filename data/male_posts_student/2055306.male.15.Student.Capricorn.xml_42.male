Have you been getting any more calls from God, or sign or such? I've been prayin.   So yeah, I need prayer and maybe people to keep me in line with doing devotions. i said i'd do them, but i keep forgetting cause there's so much, but of course that isn't an excuss but yeah. maybe ya'll can be my accountablity group =D cause i really want to do the devotions. actually i did one this morning before school so thats good. yeah i know that i need to get to know God more, because like this kinda ties into the whole "wanting realtionship blahblah" thing, cause I need to learn about God, and fall in love with God before he will bring me someone. I need to learn to love like Him, and learn to Love Him with that love first. So yeah prayer would be wonderful. Thats all for now....
