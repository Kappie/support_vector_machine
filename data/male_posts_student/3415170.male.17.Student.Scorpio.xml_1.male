I will relate it to you in a form in which you will most likely understand:  I am starving, in fact I havn't eaten in three years. I am still alive though. When food is put in front of me, I stare at it for a long time but am afraid to begin eating. After a time it gets cold and is no longer suitable for eating. I get up from the table and sit back down on the floor, hungry as ever. In my mind I cannot bring myself to do what I long to do the most.  Is that not insane? What can someone do when put in a situation such as this? I'm going crazy here.  Off to Subway.
