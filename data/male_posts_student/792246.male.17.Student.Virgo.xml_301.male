I've disabled anonymous commenting, because there really is no need for it. If you want to comment on my site, and you don't have a Blogger account already, sign up for one for free in like 5 seconds. You don't need to make a blog, just an account. The profile feature here provides a nice mini-network of sorts that Blogger didn't previously have. It's not LiveJournal, but it's not meant to be.  Woo! So once more, all previous comments have been wiped. Have fun with that!
