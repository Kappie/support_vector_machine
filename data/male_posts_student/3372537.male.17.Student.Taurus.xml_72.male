If you want details, read my lj.  There's some relevant fun and funny rants in there.  I'm being stalked by the word coconut.  So Emily and I hung out after I got off work today.  We went on a Target spree.  Emily got a swimming pool for $7.48.  A big swimming pool.  I mean, big for $7.48.  You could easily fit five or six people in that thing.  I vote she puts in red food coloring once it's full.  Other options involve goldfish crackers or spaghetti.  Any way, it'll be awesome.  I'm just writing this to prove I support the swimming pool venture.  Moving right along, if you haven't seen Fight Club, you ought to.  High quality.  Continuing, I bought some movies today, and that means that I'll be going to watch them now.  So, look, at least I didn't abandon you all.  And speaking of which, I'm curious.  Who are you people that read this?  Hm?  Leave me a comment.  Let me know who knows this exists.  Come on, people.  I'll send you cookies.  Or I'll bring you cookies.  If you live close that is.  Yeah, leave me your addresses too.  And your credit card numbers.  Make sure you leave the zip code .  They need that for the credit card machine when the card isn't there.  Like when you phone in.
