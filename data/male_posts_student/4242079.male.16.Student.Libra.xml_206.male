I suppose everyone has better things to do sometimes.   A day off tomorrow. I might go get a haircut. Doubtful, but I might. More likely I will read and play computer. I should call Mark in the morning as well, I'd like to go check out his place of employment.   Robyn and Collette came to see me at work today. It made me rather happy. I talked briefly to Amber about Robyn today, and...*ahem*.  After work, I went to Timmy's with Amber, where said conversation occured. Hm. Well, for lack of anything better to do...sleep time it is.  Too bad, too. I feel  hot  today.
