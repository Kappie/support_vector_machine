I successfully completed half of my Moral project last night, but due to my classmate's incompetence, the diskette which he gave me, that contained the necessary information for the project was faulty.    My internet friend, who is Asian, lives in a neighbouring country. I nearly freaked out while eating my dinner last night. I was reading the papers as I ate and came across an article about her country. It said that her country has an alarming rate of human trafficking. Girls, mostly underage and teenage, are trafficked from Thailand, the Phillipines and Indonesia for sexual exploitation. Some of them willingly become prostitutes whereas the others are forced into it.   The question really is; how many of them are voluntary and how many are forced? It is a poor thing to enslave a peer, a human being. It is as poor as being a politician.   Those girls who are now, as I write, being exploited, are daughters, lovers, sisters or friends. They have hearts, just like their exploiters. However, the only difference is that the abuser's heart is the one that is in pleasure and the abused is in pain.  Pleasure, derived from pain, is extremely sadistic and unnatural. The girls had their lives stolen from them just so that some horny bastard can have his overdue orgasm. I think that wanking is an even nobler thing to do than forcing an underage girl to have sex.   Since when was it natural for an adult Gorilla to have sexual intercourse with its young? Incest among animals may be understandable, but not pedophilia. The purpose of an adult is to protect its minors, not to injure them. Human beings are supposed to be more refined than animals, but there are just too many of us who call themselves "Human Beings" but are unable to follow the simple rules of nature.   This image, that inevitably occurs all over the world as we speak, isn't half as frightening as the bigger picture. Thousands of children are trafficked every year and exploited upon arrival. What if your loved one is a target of such savagery? What can be done to protect them?   As a normal citizen, I don't think I can do much to solve this problem except to write about it and complain. It is entirely up to those shit heads who are sitting on their ever-expanding arses in parliament, doing almost absolutely nothing about it. However, when this becomes a global disaster and UNICEF starts putting the pressure on, only then will the incompetent leaders of the world stand up and take charge. Even so, it can be assured that when the big kahuna has died down, they'll all return to gobbling their caviar and gulping down their cognac.     If this cruel trade continues, all of our loved ones are in serious danger. Your sister, your friend, could be next on a pedophileâ€™s list.    The border between humans and animals is a rather wide one. At least animals don't kidnap the young of their neighbours for brutal sexual exploitation.
