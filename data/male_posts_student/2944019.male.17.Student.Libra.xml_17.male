Siahara didn't came to the meeting place to get her book that she wants to borrow. 4.  I forgot my pe uniform and when pe came, I found out that we don't need to wear it first and the admin changed the uniform. 5.  The weather is playing tricks on me.  Umuulan pag lumalabas ako. 6.  Nasunog yung sinaing ko...  But above all these terrible things that happened to me today, I still have to thank God for giving me a another day to live! :-)  SONG OF THE DAY...  I believe in you and me - whitney houston  I believe in you and me, I believe that we will be In love eternally, well as far as I can see You will always be the one, for me, Oh yes you will I believe in dreams again, I believe that love will never end And like the river finds the sea I was lost, now I'm free Cause I believe in you and me  I will never leave your side, I will never hurt your pride When all the chips are down, I will always be around Just to be right where you are, my love Oh, you know I love you boy I will never leave you out I will always let you in To places no one's ever been Deep inside, can't you see That I believe in you and me  Well maybe I'm a fool, to feel the way I do But I will play the fool forever Just to be with you forever I believe in miracles, and love's a miracle And yes, baby you're a dream come true I was lost, now I'm free I believe in you and me See I was lost, now I'm free Cause I believe in you and me Oh yes I do I believe in you and me
