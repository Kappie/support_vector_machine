Nehoo, I went to Roehampton university for there open day, and I was quite pleasantly surprised at how big and unlike college, clean the whole area. I mean I'm quite surprised that in greater London there's actually a large a space that there is there, I mean there's parks and ducks and everything to awaken the senses for when you become bored with the pressure of university work.   I went to this odd party in Molesey on Saturday night, and being in Molesey there were quite a few people inevitably from work present (work being Tesco's for people who don't know) and I'm yet to make up my mind whether it was good or bad. I guess when I heard my friend say "if your initial reaction to a party isn't good, then it never was", he was most probably right, and anyway the guys whos party it was was an adultaring up his own arsehole anyway, so that just about has tipped the balance into the bad side of the court.  I hope to get tickets for Chelsea next week, just heard some more have been made available, but it seems doubtful, but hopefully it will all come of anyway I'll post later. xBuBzx
