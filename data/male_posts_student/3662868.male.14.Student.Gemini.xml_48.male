This whole hurricane thing has got me worried. I normally don't mind storms, but hurricanes...They suck.   When your power goes out for a week, it's more than just a bitch in the kitchen.   I'm also stressed because of CENSORED but I'm sure things with CENSORED and CENSORED will be just fine.    No CENSORED you're not stressing me out...I'm just nervous about CENSORED CENSORED CENSORED and stuff.      In other news...I got a cdrw drive and you can check out my total rampage on my old drive at:  urlLink http://www.eeksgamestation.com/havoc.html    Are you scared by that?   Hm?   Just let it serve as a reminder...   A reminder not to get in my way.   All that you would have to do is set me off and BLAM something...Or someone...Could get broken.   The funny thing is, I wasn't even pissed off when I trashed that old drive.   Kinda makes you wonder.    Doesn't it?
