I'm like this: Waking up at 5:30 in the morning to watch Magandang Umaga ng Bayanandread theflash reports and zysygy. After that I go to the bathroom to take a cold shower, then prepare my uniform and pick up my bag to start anohter episode of my life. Things change, but not for me. I already gave up everything just to find something unusual for me. I am already fed up with the usual things people doesn't even consider to look after. For me people with ordinary lives will not reach the maximum point of The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility or they already shut down their lives while making their way to thetop. Many people are like this, but I'm not. People always looked at me beyond their usual perspective. I reckon them, just with a little thanks...after that, I'm ready to start my engine to drive myself where my feet wants to go.
