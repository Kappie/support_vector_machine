My Brother and I were watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3, the one where they go back in time to japan to rescue april. Yeah, and I fell asleep.  Fell asleep, and woke up at 10p.m. So I practically missed out on everything today. So I'll keep it short and sweet.  PZ.  Today's Message From Erwin: Vampires are afraid of sunlight.
