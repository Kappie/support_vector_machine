I arrived this afternoon for my Physical Anthropology lab, which was located on the main floor of the Henry Marshall Tory Building. As I rounded the corner of the final hall, I was greeted by a half dozen people sporting bio-hazard safety suits, respirators and all.  "What the fu...!?"  Right  next  to the door to my lab, they had a sealed plastic working area, and hoses running up into the ceiling. Apparently, they were there to remove  asbestos  from the building. I dunno, maybe it's just me, but for all the money I pay in tuition, is it too much to ask that the classrooms I'm learning in won't case me bodily harm? Is that  really  such an unreasonable request?   Currently: Putting the final touches on my term paper extraordinaire!
