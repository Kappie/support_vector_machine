So I get the genius idea to put this minty cream on my schnozz to clear up my nose. It's kinda like Vicks VapoRub except not Vicks. Now the fumes are going directly into my eyes and water is pouring out of them nonstop. Seriously, there is a tear every ten seconds or so. Hopefully when my mom gets back with the Neo-Citron I'll feel better.
