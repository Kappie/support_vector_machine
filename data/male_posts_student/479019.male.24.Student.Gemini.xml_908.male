I'm too happy about the lack of vegetables in this house. It's ironic. I eat crap here in California, but I exercise a lot. In Binghamton, I eat super healthy, but I sit on my ass all day. For most people, home means good healthy food... not here. I should go get some fresh veggies and make lunch before my job interview in the afternoon.  Been watching DVDs lately too...  Enter the Dragon  and  Reign of Fire .  I got  urlLink EndNote . I entered in my bibliography for my  Planet of the Apes  paper and I'm going to play with it a bit more. I think it can be an extremely useful program. Now if only I was a programmer... I'd expand it beyond a bibliographic database, to something that can cross reference actual notes. Like you can click on a hyperlink for Walter Benjamin and you can pull up your personal notes on readings.  The past 2 days I've also been re-ripping all my CDs... (and brother's). No more of this 128 kbps or lower crap.  Am I productive? Or not? I don't feel productive.  Today I'm hanging out with Cambrige girls and watching  Shrek 2 .  ***
