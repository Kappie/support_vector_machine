And I figured out how to phrase what I wanted to say. I don't want to ignore the fact you went to hungary when you get back, I want to learn and know what happened because thats what I would do if your here. I love you and want nothing more than to be with you. Basically, we have a lot of catching up to do :) in a very good way.  and hey :-P not to sound rude, but your time hasnt been that much worse cause ur there. I had my fair share of hard times and rough spots as well :-P hehe. All I know, is that no matter how hard one side or the other has been, I have been there for you (I hope) and you have been there for me. Its hard to "just talk" if something is suddenly going wrong, but as much as possible its been good. I just wanna say thanks for everything. You didnt have to call me as much as you did and you coulda easily gone off and had a wild time, in many of those ways.. lol. You are wonderful, and I could not ask, imagine, or even dream of a better girl, friend, as well as girlfriend than you.  I'm off to see like three movies tonite, or maybe just two, or something. Don't worry, I am saving the notebook or arthur or whatever you want to see for you time, hehe.   Be Happy (somewhere deep inside) *mwah*
