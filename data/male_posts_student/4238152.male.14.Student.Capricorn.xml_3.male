It made me realize one thing – being with bad eggs will cause you to turn bad as well. It’s just so sad that I had to lose friends along the way. But as the old saying goes (or is it my  saying ) gone with the bad in with the good. Whatever the case, I’ve found out that I’m still good – At least where my beliefs are concerned. I don’t stand for calling others ‘fatherless bastards’; nor disgracing my family or myself; nor being so thick – skinned to the extent of having everyone walk out on you. I had better stop here before things get personal. But as you can see the person in question is none other than Ron. The stinking… …you know… … I’m amazed that he’s still around and still acting like as though he’s so cool. I find it getting more and more difficult to write things in perspective but I must try me very best before I disgrace the name of my family and myself. Now looking at things in perspective: Ron to me is a like a pool of water. He’s always the way people shape him and I will always stand by that. Oh yeah, and did I mention he’s a bully? I can’t help but question his credibility regarding his parentage. You see, humans have something known s a guilt conscience and will pick on others who are in the same boat because, like a smoke – screen, this would draw attention away from themselves. And Ron keeps on picking on Bo Hui and Wai Keat. Why? For the record, Bo Hui’s father died of cancer when Bo Hui was young and Wai Keat has a medical problem. I am not specially mentioning this two extremely pleasant souls to spite them or anything but surely one would see the irony of this all. Having been a friend of Ron for some time, I now know the reason behind his being retained and I’m none too surprised. In fact, I’m grateful for him because he has walked the beaten path and I now know how to avoid the same  ending  as him. With every passing word, I am feeling more and more ashamed of myself. Instances of Ron and his unfair treatment towards others have come flooding back. Connections regarding a case, which I missed out, have joined back to complete the jigsaw. I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to those whom I may have mistreated or whom I did not offer help to when Ron unfairly treated them. I also urge all there people to come forward and speak up against such injustice. To put it across bluntly, I do not want the level to be dominated by a  retainee  and his  sidekicks . The sad thing is, many of his so – called ‘sidekicks’ are in fact fair weather friends. I admit that I was indeed one of them but having straightened my thinking; I can now safely watch Ron destroy himself from afar. Enough of Ron; lets move on to further examine the different characters who ‘hang out’ with him.  Losers  No hard feelings please; this group of people are the misfits of society and to escape from being picked on by others, they join a group for temporary protection. I pity this group of people the most because their situation is akin to that of choosing between the devil and the deep blue sea.  Manipulators  Like I said earlier, Ron is like a pool of water. This group of people has a measurable intellect and uses this to manipulate Ron for their personal gains. I personally despise this group of people the most. I mean Ron is retained and that’s no need to further emphasize  this  by making use of him. Then again, he deserves it.  Man on the Street  The man on the street is innocent but finds Ron and company interesting. He or she will ‘hang out’ with them for a while until he loses interest and leaves the group. Now that the various groups of people who might be associated with Ron have been listed, I must as Mdm. Tang once said, “If you can’t be a solution, don’t be a problem.” I shall now attempt to find ways and means to end Ron’s tyranny or more likely the manipulators tyranny. Like I said, the people Ron mixes with define him. So I suggest we place Ron amongst a group of monkeys. As the saying goes, “Monkey see; monkey do.” In this case, theres nothing for the monkeys to see or do so they’ll just pass time scratching each other. (Wait! How can they scratch each other if no one teaches them to? But I’m sure Ron can teach them. After all  monkey see; monkey do .) For the losers, I’m at a loss for words. They are so pitiful yet at the same time they aren’t exactly the ones whom you would want to interact with usually. So, I propose we send them for an Adam Khoo course and see if they can change their believes. After all, I’m a loser so are you. Wait a minute that sounds a little wrong doesn’t it? For the manipulators, what can I say? I mean they constantly prey on the inferior lot of people. Therefore, the probable solution would be to isolate them on a far away island like Bali where they’ll be bombed by the terrorists who apparently are already manipulated by someone else. Like they always say getting a taste of your own medicine. And last but not least, the man on the street. Nothing new here; they’ll just look around, maybe be part of the group for a period of time before leaving. No harm done but while he or she is at not, why not try manipulating Ron? Its jolly good fun you know? I’ve said my piece, I’ve lost a friendship I wished I never had and I’m glad for that. After all, one should see the way Ron’s  ex  – classmates treat him – with such distaste like as though they had seen something awful like a  garbage bag , which leaves a foul aftertaste.  Nofing has not gotten over this and swears to fight it out with Ron to the end. Unfortunately, the after effects of sublime influence have made themselves known and he now spends his time giving new meanings to the acronym RON. Examples include, ‘Rotten Old Niger’ and ‘Retained Overaged Nitwit’.
