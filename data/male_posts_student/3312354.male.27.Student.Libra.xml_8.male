It's one of those things that gets mentioned all the time, but most people probably couldn't explain what really happened.   http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reagan/peopleevents/pande08.html  I'm really sick of all the Reagan ass-kissing that's been going on in the wake of his death. This guy was in NO WAY a good president and it is a shame that he's getting credit for things like ending the Cold War. In all liklihood, he actually EXTENDED it! This guy really hurt America and I think that the negative effects of his presidency will be felt for a long time.   Tyson, what do the Russians think of Reagan? It seems to me that crediting him with the end of the Cold War takes a lot of recognition away from the people of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union who, through many different means, gradually wore down the Communist regime, proving it couldn't work.
