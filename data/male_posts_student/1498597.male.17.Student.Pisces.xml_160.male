Things are seriously goin' haywire around here.  Really!  As if life wasn't complicated enough, huh?  Seems like things are kinda outta whack...Alright!  To business!  Lotsa shit is happenin' here on the  P.R.E. !  Guess what?!  I think I'll finally be able to launch the long-procrastinated on  Operation: Revolution !  Koolaid, huh?  I know!  I'm fuckin' psyched!  Anyway, its been such a long ass time since I proposed that  Operation: Revolution  take place, that I kinda forgot exactly what would be changin'.  I've had some time to think about different improvements I can put on here, and I think I have a definite plan layed out.  Here's what I've thought up:     1.   The Face of Change.   If you hadn't already noticed, the  P.R.E.  got a brand new look just a few days ago, and I think it looks really kick ass!  Erm, I'm not done remodelin' the bitch yet though.   HTML  can really be a fuckin' whore.  I'm not to good at it either.  Anyway, I did the white-on-black scheme (no, I assure you I was not motivated by the white-on-black hate crimes that occur so frequently but go so unnoticed in this country) and I'm pretty happy with it.  So that means "I'm not fuckin' goin' to change it if you don't like it."  Nah, I'm just kiddin', but most of you (well three of you) said it looked OK, so lets just stick with it, alright?  Oh, I'll try to post up links to yer blogs too guys.  Gotta show the love.  I'm gonna try to put up links to some sites I think you guys should take a look at, like....oh!  There was this one gay porno site that had the best "anal fuckin' in shower" scene I ever-haha I'm only playin' with ya...or am I?       2.   Sound Bites!   Well, you guys all now how obsessed I am with music.  I mean, come on, its like the best fuckin' way to get yer opinion out there.  So, I thought up of a little thing I like to call  Sound Bites!   This interestin' little column is gonna be my sorry ass attempt to bring you the latest news in  punk, ska, and hardcore .  I'm gonna try and post up CD reviews, stories, tour dates, and band info.  Ah, what the fuck, I'll even have flashbacks and throw in some  80's  and  oldies ! How fuckin' awesome is that gonna be!?  Hopefully I can get that started up soon.  It sounds really fuckin' cool!        3.   Just take a look, its in a book!   Hey, why not follow  Nick's  example and try to throw in a few book reviews?  I know what yer thinkin'.  Right when I mentioned  Nick  and  books  you prolly thought "God, how fuckin' boring!"  (Haha, I'm just kiddin'  Nick !)  But, hey, lemme take a shot at it.  I mean, what have I got to lose, you know?  Anyway, I'll try to pick up interestin' titles and read 'em and discuss 'em on here and try to tie them into our lives.  Oooh, sounds like an English assignment.  Whoop-dee-frickin'-doo!       4.   Punk Rock Karaoke!   I thought maybe it'd be fun to post up lyrics here on the  P.R.E. !  I mean, there's so many freakin' songs out there!  I dunno, it sounds like a cool idea.  No, I won't limit lyrics to just  punk rock songs  (although that genre will be the majority on here [No shit, huh?!]).  Just like with  Sound Bites! , I'll put up some  oldies  and  80's  and some other shit.         5.   Don't hate, participate!   Yeah, I want you guys (yeah all fuckin' five or six of you) to send me some feedback dammit!  This ain't just my blog...its a blog for the modern thinkin' public.  I wanna know what you guys think and stuff (Aww aren't I considerate?).  Yeah thats right, gimme suggestions on how to make this site more kick ass (then it already is!).  Hey, you might be able to score some recognition!  Drop me a line motherfuckers!  Even if they're angry letters!  Oh yeah, my address is  ThEPuNkRoCkKiD13@aol.com .  So, all in all, just expect to see some new things comin' up on the  P.R.E. .  OK, now...there's somethin' really weird goin' on.  Or maybe I was just totally oblivious to it or...or somethin'.  But recently, there's been a rise in aggressiveness received from parents, or at least mine.  I dunno about yers, but well mine...I noticed an increase in arguments and stuff.  I mean, if you know me, I'm no stranger to the lecture and things like that...but...hmm...damn.  I've got a mental block.  Actually, I didn't anticipate to blog this long, and I gotta go do my homework...So, I'll come back on tomorrow and continue on...More to come...!
