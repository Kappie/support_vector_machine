She was like them, warm and nice. Now, it FUCKING burns. Through air, it stings like it stings. My trophies on the inside were the best times gone by. Irreplaceable. The plaques in the open-aired shelf reflect nothing- nothing through faded fake gold. Spiderman turns his face from me while Baal looks me in the eye. He calls to me - he who is inclined to answer is indeed a desperate pilot. I long for my day in may once more. Anniversary.
