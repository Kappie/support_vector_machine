HD starts telling me about The Residents as he does everytime he sees me and I reply that I'm having trouble with e-mails. This topic is taken rather well and many anecdotes and discussions arise. How very dull, I was also very wet after getting drenched on the walk up. Then Paul turns highly intoxicated in the blink of an eye and starts complaining about road tax. He has none, they are doing him, he thinks it's unfair, no-one backs him up, he shouts at coppers walking past, we laugh, I leave. Very good. And then I came online and I am lost..... Oh SHM! comeback.... I smile at NTL's blog and Wills' loung site. I will write a poem.  The concise nature of life reminds, Me of a ship capsized. The Hull is on the left now Captain! Oh shit we've gone past Rome!
