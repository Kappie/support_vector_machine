Their is a State Senator of Illinois named Barack Obama, who is running for a seat in the United States Senate, and according to the New York Sun, "He is tomorrow."  I couldn't agree more.  His speech electrified me, and everyone in Boston that Monday night--so much so that I emailed Dan with the appropriate links to watch his speech, and I told him that I wouldn't be surprised if in twenty or so years Obama would be at least involved in a Democratic Primary election.  If I have ever seen a black man who has the slightest chance of successfully running for President in the future.  This is the man.  What a landmark event it would be.  A black President, and as if that weren't remarkable enough--he is an amazing politician at that.  He spoke of division, but preached unity.  Barack knows a thing or two about polarity--the New York Sun placed the words better than I ever could, "Mr. Obama, who is half white and half black, is all American."  Keep your eyes open for Barack Obama, his part will come to play in the future, and if it does not, we will have been robbed of a great possibility.
