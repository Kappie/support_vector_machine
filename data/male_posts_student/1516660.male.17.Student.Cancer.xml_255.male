They went to the market without me, as I have no mood to walk in this idiotic weather (rainy....for 4 straight days!! qi shu lin!). After bathing, I went online and surfed to wait for my breakfast.  Breakfast (duck porridge) was brought back. I ate and continued with my MNI. More theories and mysteries to solve. I hate time differences. When I post my theories, I have to wait for one whole day to see the author's reply (she's living in the US, and when I am awake, she's not). Ergh! Anyway, I continued surfing until lunch.  For lunch, we went to 768 to eat. I ate ban mian. Eat something hot, the weather is so cold outside. After lunch, we came back. I surfed the Net till about 2.30.  Me and Dad went out to collect the pig. Heh Heh. I brought my book along (The Tangle Box). We took the MRT towards AMK Station, then from there, take bus 130 towards Balestier. I read my book during the long journey.   Arriving at Balestier, we went to the bank. It looks like I have to take out $110 from my account to pay for the TV license. HaHa. Now the TV is in my control! Paying for the license means authority over the main TV. Woo!! Heh Heh. No la.   After that, we went to the 933 Duck to get our roasted pig. So cute one! It was about half an umbrella long. HaHa. The eyes were closed, and I can see very little teeth (because the mouth's closed). So cute!!! HaHa. We waited for Uncle to fetch us lor. He came after long periods of waiting. The two men talked and talked (in Hokkien) whole I read my book. When we are coming back, we saw PuiPui (Mom's colleague) walking on the way home. Uncle thought we were stopping there because I shouted to my Father "Look! PeiPei!". Heh Heh.   After that, I played my PT until dinner time lor. I ate dinner, read my book (Now Witches' Brew. I finished Tangle Box). I bathed and came online lor.  HaHa! YaY!! I got an Outstanding for my Charms essay!! YaY!! YaY!! 7 Galleons to moi! HaHa. I thought the ending was crappy, because I was rushing to complete it before American Idol. Actually, I was running about 10 minutes late into AI. HaHa.   Well, I gotta go now. Gotta watch the fabulous AI. Oh Simon! I love his caustic comments! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
