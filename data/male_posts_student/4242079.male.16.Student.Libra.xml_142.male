To "Power-Up" a section of the store. Sure sounds like a clever ploy to make me do actual work for a change. Meh. It's not all bad, at least I'll get the money...no wait, I'm off tomorrow, no money. Well, self-satisfaction at least. But when was the last time self-satisfaction ever bought a pretty lady lunch?  After I'm done that, the staff of RadioShack 5868 will be heading out to Boston Pizza to spend our well earned cellular bonus gift certificates. Not the ideal way to spend a Friday night, but I guess free food isn't such a bad thing, and perhaps I was invited to the Country Club by Stacee and Lindsay tomorrow night. Might just take them up on that offer.  Chantelle and the hot-girl-whos-name-i-can-never-remember...Ashley...came in to RadioShack today and I went and ate lunch with them. Chantelle I think is one of my favorite people right now. She's so friendly, and is also a direct link back to another best summer of my life (the one previous to the one discussed in the last entry).  Tonight, on my way out of the mall, I hear this female voice yelling at me (it's been happening a lot lately, all calling my name to get my attention, but they're all attached). "Tanner", the voice called. I stopped, looked around, surprised. There is a pretty girl sitting on the curb, looking up at me. "Do you remember me?". How could I forget such a pretty face? I'm not sure, but I did. All I could say was "No". But as soon as I said it I remembered. Melissa Derksen. She's the reason I know Shyla, Collette, and the better part of all my Red Deer friends. All because she wanted to talk to me at the dAYZ wAGE concert so long ago. I sat down beside her on the curb and started to talk. I've been taking every opportunity to work on my conversation skills. One thing I've really been trying to work on is talking about the other person, making them tell me everything about them. I guess all that sales training has been paying off. Ha. But seriously, I have been trying to ask them questions, and if they say something that happened to them, I ask more questions about it. She said something about scewing up at work, then stopped talking. I asked her how she screwed up, and she seemed surprised, almost shocked, that someone would want to know. Then her boyfriend (as far as I could tell) pulled up in his car, and I wasn't surprised that she would feel that. From what I see, he doesn't seem like the type that would care. That's not my problem though.  I'm going to get a haircut tomorrow.
