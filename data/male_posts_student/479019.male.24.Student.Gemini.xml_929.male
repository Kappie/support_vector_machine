Afterwards, Melissa, Becky and I watched  Clockwork Orange  and played Scrabble. It was cool.  I sort of talked about this before and the topic came up in class Thursday. We read some articles on third wave feminism, and one of them commented the influence of riotgrrl and online zines. Stephanie commented on how that subcultural stuff is simply something that people think is cool, and women don't transition into any sort of real politics from there. I rebutted her comment that, that subculture is something that does lead to the creating of academics and artists with politics. However, she argued that, that means that they're just all bourgeois. I don't really agree with her on that... I'm sure my many of my friends (some of you who read this) would disagree. I mean, come on... there's a big difference between these women than women who listen to misogynistic pop music and let society push 'em around. This goes back to my comments a few days ago in how I can't separate my musical tastes and subcultural roots from my academic work.  A different topic... I think I stumbled back into a trap, that I thought I had got out of. Things that made me angry still really annoy me, but sometimes you get blinded by other things...  ***
