Unlike Collins which is a super good awsome gun fight matrix pariody movie thats cool ours is simple and...simple. All the editing realy needs is a slide show tibit of Albertsons stuff. I really want to see the finishing product on Collins though :)  On another note yester day was my moms birthday and also (drum roll please) my half birthday!!! That means i can get my permit (Technically) and i just realized that when Ryan Jones said "Dont you know you can get your permit now?" and then i write. The first thing that comes to mind is "Road Rage" woo hoo. At our neighbors house we went to eat and for my moms B-Day and we started a conversation about road rage and the whole time i was listening i thought of "Road Rage Brad". I heard stories of Mr. Couture and his road rage and then the conversation stoped due to the stupidity of Kenny (8th grade friend) who climed well tried to over a turned over coucn on its end and it fell and he almost hit tons of Priceless pottery and Mr Couture said "Geise Kenny, why dont you just take a bat and hit the pottery!" It was great! Then we all realized that it was 10:30 so we left.  Im writing a story of Link and his adventures just for fun and its pretty good so far even though its one paage long...its good  adios....i think
