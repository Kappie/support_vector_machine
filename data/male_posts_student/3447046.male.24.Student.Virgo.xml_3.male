So after sending electrical currents through my nerves, he said I don't have carpal tunnel, but the nerve response in both arms is slow.  I told him I dislocated my left shoulder about 5 years ago, so he starts checking out the nerves higher on the arm.  Then he pulls out this needle.  This needle hooks up to the machine.  He starts poking the needle into various muscles.  I wasn't too comfortable about it.  It hurt for the most part, especially when he started sticking the needle in the back of my neck.  That was the worst.  So, in the end, he found no evidence of pinched nerves, nor carpal tunnel.  The doctor did say that I have slight nerve damage in both arms, and that I should get tested for diabetes.  I don't want to get tested for diabetes.  If it comes back positive, I'd have to change my eating habits, and probably stop drinking Pepsi.  I guess I can change to caffeine free diet pepsi (tastes just like pepsi) cause diet pepsi tastes like crap.  Oh well.  I guess I'll get tested later...hehe
