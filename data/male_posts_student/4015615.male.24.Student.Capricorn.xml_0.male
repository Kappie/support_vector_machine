Not the kind of headache that's characterized by numb pounding (like my first sexual experience), instead it's sharp, stabbing pain in my temple...like my first bah-mitvah. That was a reach. Sorry.  I tried not to think about it but every 20 minutes or so it became intensely painful and caused me to grit my teeth in anguish and wait for it to pass. It was like this for about a day or so when my lady convinced me to go to the ER. I have little faith in doctors and so actually driving down to the emergency room is a big move for me...right up there with missing my daily shower. So they shot a few quick questions at me, got my insurance and then threw me in an operation room where a girl holding ice over her eye sat waiting with her mother. The nurse curtly told me to change into a smock and lie down on a very uninviting table. When she left all I could think was, "People have died on this table...people have come here, bleeding and screaming and then they died"  ...  I sat on a chair next to the table and read my book. I listened to the girl and her mother talking but the mother was less intelligible than Mayor Menino on muscle relaxants and I couldn't make out a damn word she was saying. Someone finally came in (not a doctor!) and talked to me about my headache and looked in my ears and eyes. This was proceeded by many 'hmmmm''s and 'let me go read about something...' 20 minutes later and 3 more people 'hmmmming', I was sent out the door with a prescription for Motrin. This is why I hate going to the doctor's.  The headache finally went away but it took plenty of Motrin. As I told Hollywood Rick, this was enough Motrin to anesthesize a leg getting ripped off. Even though I was kinda pissed they just gave me some over the counter crap to take, I was really glad when I woke up the next morning feeling better. I couldn't imagine having to get CAT scans and the like.  Off to Fire Island this weekend with the lady and old Tony is going to be there as well. It'll be like The Flintstones meet the Jetsons or Scoopy Doo meets salmonella.  Hope people got to see Kerry speak last night, it was pretty amazing except for the "hair pollution" slip.
