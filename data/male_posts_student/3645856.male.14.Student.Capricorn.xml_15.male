I can't get the picture Shelly sent me out of my head. She had a half cup of pudding she forgot and left on a table at her house and it's all crusty and boily looking and it's coming out of the cup. ick. jfiqhgfei bwah...   urlLink    I haven't posted in a couple of days as i've been at josh's house and was only able to get on the computer to for about 10 minutes and during that time I was trying to get a problem straightened out with a forum i'm a member of and it keeps screwing up and not logging in... oh well... i'll post when i'm bored. I'm not really bored right now and I don't have much to say. I'm actually sort of busy right now, so.... until we meet again.  Peace and love.... and happiness.   ~ George
