Then we had hamburgers and hot dogs and brownies (yum!).  By then, the rain had stopped, so we headed down to Hutchinson to see the fireworks.  We sat right across the lake from where they were set off, so we could see the explosions perfectly.  Then we went back to Bob's and had a night swim.  We ended up telling scary stories all huddled together in the pool.  Now I am home and comfy in my sweatpants.  What a day.  Tomorrow will bring mulch.   Yuck!  I really hope it downpours tomorrow morning.  In the afternoon, Grandma Connie is having a picnic for family and friends and whatnot.  Then back to Summer Gym on Tuesday.  Eat 'n Park sure would be good tomorrow morning....
