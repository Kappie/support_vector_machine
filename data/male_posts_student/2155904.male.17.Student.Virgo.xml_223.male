He (his mom) got some photo albums and he printed off some hot pictures of himself and put them in the albums.  It was kinda one of those things where he covers both bases.  Most people are gonna bring gifts so you can't be overlooked but it's also not so big of a deal that you have to go all out so he just did a nice little Tyke thing.  And they are great friends of Tyke's so he wanted to do something for them at least.  After he made the presents he got his Muse cd and went out to his car to drive up to Haras'.  Tyke got gas on the way and damn that's expensive.  Luckily Tyke doesn't have to pay for it himself.  At the party Tyke talked with K-Caj for a little bit when Haras was busy with the parents (there were a lot of adults there) and then Tig when she came over.  Tyke and Tig became a mini-duo at Haras' cuz they had the same schedule for the day, at least for the most part.  So they talked at Haras' for a while and it was really nice out so it made it a pleasant chat but then Tyke and Tig left for Tina's.  Tina's was really fun.  Tyke and Tig met up with Lyndon Johnson, Amyazing, Purdy, and other great ladies.  Tyke was of course the only guy there so that made it fun.  When Tyke hangs out with that group he is mostly the only guy there.  Or at least that's what Tyke and Tina thought.  After watching the hydros, looking through scrapbooks, eating food, and doing other stuff the girls all left so it was just Tyke and Tina.  But Tina was busy with all of the adults there so Tyke realized that he probably wasn't going to be the life of the party anymore so he tried to get a little more time with Tina and then when she got busy Tyke left.  He went over to Dotti's and met up with some new people.  Karla was there, Dudely Doo was there, Juhd was there, the list goes on and on.  It was a good time.  The pizza was really really good.  Tyke and Dotti chatted for only a little as she was pretty busy (as were all the hosts really) so Tyke just hung out by himself for a little.  Tyke ended up talking with Purdy's parents quite a bit.  He already had a relationship with them so it wasn't like it was a first time thing but he talked to them more than Purdy, at least up until later on that night.  Whoa...Tyke just looked to his right and in the reflection of the window he saw an ironing board set up behind him.  That might not sound weird but he just did like a double take and then kind of a jump back thing where he was surprised to see it there.  Sure it's only an ironing board but Tyke still was surprised to see it as he didn't notice it before now.  Anyway, at Dotti's Piggy J and Skramfejj came over so the three chatted for a little before heading up to Amyazing's party.  This party had the most people by far.  It was the most happening of all the parties Tyke went to so it was pretty fun.  Tyke talked with K-caj some more and Tank for a little and then Purdy came over so they talked for a little before she left and Tyke went to get his coat.  Tyke came back and chatted it up with Red Sox and some other people.  It was a good time.  When Tina came over later they kinda linked together and stayed together for a while.  Tyke also talked to Karla and Big Poppa Booty.  Karla's so fun to hang out with.  She's such a great party girl.  Totally Tyke-like.  Damn that's a great phrase.  Totally Tyke-like.  Just say it out loud, cuz Tyke just did.  There he did it twice more.  Just do it.  Back to the party...Tyke and Tina got to talk more at this party cuz she wasn't so busy but after a while they split a little and didn't talk as much.  Then Tyke and Red Sox talked for a while.  Tyke ended up staying for quite a bit longer than he expected.  He left at about 10:30.  Considering he wasn't even technically invited to this party, that is pretty long.  He was one of the last guys really.  But Tyke's cell phone was really pissing him off.  It was so messed up today.  It wasn't receiving calls, it wasn't connecting on phone calls, and it wouldn't even turn off.  Oh yeah, and the battery just started to kill itself for some reason.  Something better not be screwed up with it now, although he really doesn't need it again until July but that's still not acceptable.  That phone is less than a year old.  Come on!  Well Tyke is home now and tomorrow is quite a huge day.  Tyke officially graduates high school tomorrow and then is the 9 hour party.  The all nighter baby.  Let's hope Tyke's friends don't poop out on him.  He is going to rock that party.  He never really seems to get that tired so he doesn't expect to have much trouble with this party.  His eyes might have trouble though.  Yeah, he's been having some eye problems lately.  He should prolly take some eye drops with him.  But this isn't blogworthy anymore.  It is just Tyke talking to himself.  Well today was busy but tomorrow is even more busy.  Then comes a day off sorta and then wow...Europe.
