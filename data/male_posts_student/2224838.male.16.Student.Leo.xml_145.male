All the signs are there: I'm going to bed at a fairly decent time, yet waking up in the middle of the afternoon, there have been a few days when I successfully stay inside all day, and my daily activities include being on the computer and watching TV or movies. Luckily, I am determined to break out of this soon, and I guess I will have to by next week because I will be taking a class for three weeks. Still, even the class won't get me out of bed because it doesn't start until 11:30. So it looks like I will have to rely on my own ambition to get out of bed each day and do something productive, like getting a job.  While I have been inside these past few days, I have been working a bit on a website layout, and just yesterday I started on the style sheet (or I should say, my brother started it). I really don't know what will go on the site beside my blog, but I have been meaning to make a site for a while just to learn the process. Once the site is ready to upload, my brother will still be hosting it for the time being. I will hopefully be able to get my own domain sometime in the near future.  By the way, I have been looking into making a visit to the University of Missouri-Columbia, and I was wondering if anyone had an opinion on the school. The school is supposed to have a great journalism department, and that is one of the areas I am considering.
