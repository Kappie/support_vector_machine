My friend Linda is going too, she will be my companion to the ceremony but she'll bring her boyfriend to the party later at night. I did not want to say something near Valentine's day, but how much can someone take? I will be attending a wedding a day before V day and I'll be spending the first hours of the afore mentioned holiday alone in a wedding party. I thought I had everything under control, but I don't. I can't... I can't do it all on my own. I got to a point of asking myself and fear, of so much fear, not of the question, but of the answer: How much loneliness can someone take, how much of it, when is so much that one just settles, when is so much that the only thought is just finding someone to settle with?  Is not much of aching for someone as much of you would thing... This has nothing to do with Nathaneil, Adrian, Charly, etcetera, etcetera ( well, not that much "etceteras" ... LOL ) nor does it have to do with Valentine's day. Is not the season, is not the weekend either. Is just a constant feeling, a thought in the back of my mind, a little hammer that keeps hitting, hitting and hitting. I mean, how much can you endure? How much can you yearn? How much can you take? At the end I just hope I will be able to learn and grow stronger. Is it too much to ask?  I just want to find someone that can say to me that he will wipe away my tears, he will be there to hug me when I get cold, he will care... he will care. Anyway, how pathetic can I get? Do I need to start listening to Evanescence, Sarah, Vonda, Eddie Vedder, Jeffrey Gaines and Jay Jay Johanson for you to understand how clich√© I am?
