I simply cannot count the number of times we quarrelled because she wanted to talk on the phone and was unhappy to be pulled away from the phone.......is talking on the phone so important tat nothign else in the world surpuss it? For talking on the phone......she has been late, inconsiderate andI simply cannot compromise and give in to her because if not my whole life would be simply putting a phone to myear and yaking away.........sighz......sometimes i think she just needs atele-bf...............        Quote for the day: "Don't waste your life stuck to your phone, use your eyes to see your surroundings too......."
