As you might imagine, Patti and I have been extremely busy with work and, of course, making our new home reflect what we'd like it to look like: ours.  One of the most recent things we've done is a trip to Lowe's to get some paint and get started on changing the internal colors of the house. Patti got the idea to paint the walls behind thelaundry and the refrigerator a bright white in an attempt to lighten the areas. It has worked considerably for the area behind the fridge and the washer/dryer area is still to come. She also had some designs for her closet. After doing a considerable amount of cleaning of the walls and shelves, she and I ripped out the carpet on the floor of the closet and replaced it with a nice piece of pine. Then the whole closet got painted white (same as the fridge area) and it looks awesome. We've decided that the whole bedroom will now be white because it looks so good.  For me, the projects have been somewhat less successful. My first mission was a new dog door for Blacky to fit through. A sawzall would have come in VERY handy for this project. But instead, I went ghetto and had to chisel through wood with a hammer and screwdriver. After hours of back-altering work, its about 75% done but easily usable and Blacky has adjusted very well. He hasn't moved yet, but at least we know that when he does, we won't have to worry about him using the door. My next project installing a new lighting fixture in the entryway to the master bedroom. I attempted that at 8:30pm and called it quits around 9:30 when things just didn't seem to be fitting right. I may end up taking it back to Lowe's and getting a smaller one more appropriate for the location.  So in summation, Patti's projects are going great and making things look better while mine seem to serve no other purpose than stripping my masculinity and leaving me with failure. (Was that over dramatized?!) But throughout all of these projects, we've been dealing with the details like utility companies, washing the dishes that have come out of storage, working and going to school, and ordering lots of take-out. I'm also still the Yard Commander and in charge of insect patrol, lawn maintenance, tree trimming, etc.  Its been a lot of hard work so far but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I think we're having a great time with the projects and living together has been wonderful so far. We will be moving all of the furniture this weekend and my friend Andrew has been kind enough to offer his assistance. Hopefully, once that final phase of major moving is completed, we'll be able to put the house together the way we want it.  After all is said and done, and we finally have settled in, we will be sending out invitations to our housewarming party. We're really looking forward to having all of you come and visit the new home and drink with us. I've already started preparing the alcohol supply for a diverse and prolonged necessity of thirsts. :)
