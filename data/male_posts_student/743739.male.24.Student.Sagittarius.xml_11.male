The after a few days there, it’s onto Phoenix Arizona. For those of you who haven't heard me mention this with every other sentence I use, I did an internship there a couple of years ago and look forward to seeing everyone again. I’m just not sure if they look forward to seeing me =)    Anyway, we leave at 6:30 in the morning, so I will not be here in the morning. If i see a reply before bed tonight, I might say something. If not, Asa, I leave this in your capable hands. If Martin gets out of hand, I expect you to head up to Missouri and pretend that he buys things from spam emails.
