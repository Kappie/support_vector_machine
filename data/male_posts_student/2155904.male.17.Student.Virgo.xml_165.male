It started (Maniak caught Tyke mid-type by IMing him and having the window pop up) off by going over to Macaroon's to begin the Hamlet questions that they need to have done by Wednesday.  They just about finished 1 question before heading up to Amed's to play bball with Tyronious, Maniak, and Piggy J.  It were fun times.  Then the gang went their separate ways for just a little.  Tyke and Macaroon went to Costco and were joined by Maniak and DUI.  This 4some would be the group for most of the day.  And what a group indeed.  Two hot studs leading the way with their two hot lady friends behind them.  You know which is which.  Macaroon was of course messing everything up and he just couldn't do anything right which posed problems for the dinner they were going to make later on in the night.  The gang went to Sunset to drop off Tyke's car and then Maniak drove the murder (group of crows, or in this case the "gang") down to Bell Square.  However, on the way there they stopped off at University Bookstore and got some, you guessed it, Cougar shirts.  Tyke and Maniak will match when they wear them on the first day back from break.  You just wait.  After that they went in to many a store while Tyke wore his cowboys shirt (with scotch tape magnificently holding together the torn pocket) and a cowboy-ish hat that Maniak had in his car from Tolo.  It wasn't really a cowboy hat but it looked enough like it.  Tyke saw this one guy wearing cowboy hat and tried to tip his hat to the guy like they had a special bond but everybody in his family but him looked at Tyke and they all gave him weird looks.  It was fun though.  Speaking of fun, Tyke decided after leaving A that he was going to flex for every girl that walked by him from then on.  He got some nice reactions for quite some time until one girl decided to talk back to him and said, "You wish, maybe if your 11-inch biceps grew a little."  Or something along those lines.  The you wish part she definitely said and Tyke thought he heard something about 11 and inch.  Tyke does not have 11-inch biceps though.  12 inch right bicep.  So prolly like 11 for the right.  Or 11 and 1/2.  Sumting like that.  The murder left Bell Square after Tyke tried on a $100 girl's jumpsuit at some store and then they went to DUI's for their stir-fry dinner.  The whole murder made it together although Macaroon seriously blew at doing anything.  So Tyke and Maniak hid a onion that they accidentally dropped down a hole into his rice along with a green bean.  That was fun.  And Macaroon had been making racist and sexist comments all day but he kept making more as he tried to eat with chopsticks and then made another comment to DUI that was totally uncalled for.  He needed to learn some manners.  Then he called up Amed and they told him they were coming over.  But Amed wouldn't let them use his hot tub like he should have so they kept arguing with him but he was being a hairy stubborn jackass and just wouldn't do it.  He brought out the whole "My parents won't let me use it cuz I'm too hairy" excuse but nobody was buying it.  It was just cuz nobody else was Russian.  That is the real reason.  After that whole fiasco they went up to Dr. Phil's house as he was coming back from Factoria.  So they chilled there and watched a show on MTV before going outside and leaving.  Maniak drove DUI and Tyke back to DUI's house where Tyke's car was and Tyke then said his goodbyes to the lovely couple before heading back to Dr. Phil's to join Doc P, Amed, and Macaroon on a walk around the loop.  Tyke joined up and then when Amed and Macaroon had to leave Tyke and Dr. Phil kept walking.  They walked past Tyke's car and then just kept walking and walking.  They talked about great stuff and it was a really good time.  Something that Tyke rarely gets to do.  Which made it great.  It was nice weather out too so it was pleasant.  All in all it was a great capper to the night.  As this blog should be.  At least for Maniak.  Tyke and Maniak hung out a lot today.  Good times.  Good times.
