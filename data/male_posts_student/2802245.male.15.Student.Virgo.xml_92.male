I was up at 7:15 yesterday to play in a tantrix tournament (blitz 3-hour thingy) and in the middle of it the cat starts walking around screaming it's head off wanting something. So I ignored it. So it screamed some more. So I ignored it. And then my dad got out of bed to deal with him in it's usual grumpy fashion, after I had been distracted for 5 minutes : 2. James - If you are going to use French to get cross with me, at least use proper, gramatically correct French. "Tu comprends" - OK?  I'm going to stop ranting now.  I was reading the paper, and there was a story about how the police aren't allowed to use bicycle puncture kits in the interest of their safety. I quote, "I'm allowed to use a section 5 firearm but I'm not allowed to fix my bicycle!" Suckers.  4 days until I get (nearly) killed by Jamie and Conor, and then take it all out on Joe :D  Simon - I think my head is gonna explode (Ash)
