However, the well so called "superior" reprimanded me that I should have evidence backing me as a student of nyjc doing PW.. crappy apparently she's doubting me :( Should be my dressing to there bah.. lol *bengz* lol  Next is my darling(lao po) had went to genting, I miss her very much and cried today while in the toilet strolling through the sweet sms she sent me in the morning. Sigh.. another 3 days (which will be 7pm) and hrs++ more for your arrival to singapore! come back soon dear...    Sigh.. a day without her is so monotonous! How can I withstand another 3 more days?! HELP!
