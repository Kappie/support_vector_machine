Christmas eve was stressful but the marathon session of  urlLink Chez Geek  afterwards more that made up for it.  Christmas morning was quiet, with visits to immediate family (whom we always have to visit as soon as possible during any major holiday, hence the name) and some small gift exchanging. Got a metal CD case from Mom, nice considering that I don't use CD's anymore, oh well, should be good to store harddisk backup CDs I guess. Boxing day was spent across the border with the highlight being the off-road biking tracks and the outdoor bath. The bath was a refreshing experience, at night; one can really feel like part of nature. It reminds me of my NS field camp but with better soap.  Since returning, I’ve been busy getting things ready for start of the new school year. The timing is a little off this year so it looks like some school shopping is still in order. Stuff like note-taking paper and the sort. Wish I could go paperless this year and pick up that  urlLink wireless keyboard  for my  urlLink Tungsten E , but that would depend on how much note taking there is going to be. Hopefully I won’t have to sit next to a power supply to keep my  urlLink Tungsten  juiced while typing.     >    And so it brings us right to today. Had a nice quiet lunch with  AbglCh  who is back in town on break for just a month. I was happy to be able to catch her on the day she came back but plans fell through and after which the rest of her friends and family caught up to her. So we did meet up today, but she was feeling somewhat under the weather and thus couldn’t stay long. Pity really. She is fun to talk to, is funny and is the best source for finding out how living in the US is really like. Hope to be able to meet up with her again before she goes.  All in all, a pretty good way to end off 2003. So lets all raise our glasses in the air and say:  “Hooray for the New Year! We into it without any Fear!”   Heh.   Have a good one people.
