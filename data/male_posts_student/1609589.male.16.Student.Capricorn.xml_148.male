I'm always confused why it doesnt sink in that these people are famous that show up- sometimes SUPER famous. I haven't ever seen em before, so I was just talking to him casually, although he seemed surprised I wasn't bowing before him.  Even last time, the band last month was HUGE in the U.K., but it didn't sink in, it was just kinda "Hey, how's it goin?" I think the band last month was better, personally. They made an instrument out of a turkey baster! I wouldn't have thought of that.
