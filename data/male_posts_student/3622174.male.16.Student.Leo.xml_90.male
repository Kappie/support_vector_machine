Now, undoubtedly, you've heard that I'm going to yearbook camp in the big city of Orlando, FL. If you've been reading this blog at all in the past week or so, you've noticed that I have been posting interesting stories from the past two years at camp. So, now, less than 48 hours until I leave, I start my Nerdular Nerdance, and this one lasts all the way until next Thursday. I'll have pictures from the trip (after I come back, obviously), stories from years past continuing, and, of course, the much anticipated AudioBlog of Bagel posts...hidden cellphone, anyone? Sure, why not. In today's installment, I'll be talking about the class I was in in the 2002 Yearbook Camp, and the other crazy things that happened that year.  Yearbook I: The 2002 Yearbook Camp Class Take a crazed, loud, and annoying yearbook advisor from Seminole High School, add her in with a fresh graduate from some other school, and add a bunch of yearbook things, and you get Yearbook I. The teacher was LOUD. It was me, Courtney, and Jessie in that class, and we were all kind of annoyed with her. She insisted on using a microphone. It was a pretty large room they had us in, but the class wasn't all that big, and she used the microphone, making her already loud voice even louder. In this class, we learned the basics of creating a yearbook, including the different sections, how to design layouts on paper, and how to write stories, captions, etc. It was a good start for me, because I came into the yearbook staff absolutely clueless as to anything that we would be doing. I had no idea that we created our own layouts. Boy, was I wrong about that one. Had I been on my middle school yearbook (dramatic how I turned out not to be on it, but, we won't go into that), then I probably would have had a little more knowledge as to what was going on, but, I wasn't. So, oh well. Anyway. The teacher was loud, I don't know how to stress that one enough. And, the final project that we had to complete was very tedious (I'm horrible at cutting things out of magazines...HORRIBLE!). We had to design a layout, complete with story, captions, pictures, etc. Everything, essentially. There was a lot of it, but, at least I got through it. By the way, did I mention the teacher was loud? LOUD!!!  2002 Camp: The Story of Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's Mom Being a new staff member that year, I didn't know Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's mom. I had no idea that getting in a car with her would be the riskiest thing in the world. Well, guess what folks, it turned out that way. Me, Courtney, and Melissa all got stuck riding with Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's Mom and Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's daughter. Backing out of the driveway, we hit Lisandra's (a senior at that time) car. No damage. But, still, she rammed into it. We didn't tell anyone, and I don't think it was until October of that year when someone blurted it out (and it was probably me, but I don't remember). And, when we were on a busy highway in Orlando heading to Chili's, she tried getting over a lane so she could turn left, and she ALMOST hit another car...THAT would have sucked. Had we hit that car, Melissa probably wouldn't be here today. I wonder why Mrs. Yearbook Advisor didn't have her mom drive last year......  And that's all I've got for today. Later on, I've got the "Top 10 Cars of 2005" list, which will have pictures and things of the 10 cars that I think look the sweetest for 2005. Then, I PROMISE I'll do a Late Night Bloggin' tonight, and maybe something else, if I have time. Tomorrow's Nerdular Nerdance is all about Camp Orlando 2003. See ya next time.
