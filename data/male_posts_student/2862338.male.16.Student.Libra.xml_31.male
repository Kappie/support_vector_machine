For now on, i'm juss gonna try toacutally CORRECT myself, i appologize to everyone who has read this, puzzled by what kinda language i'm using, i'm sorry....BUT, that still dosn't stop them from happening, it's just that i'm going to try to lessen it up a bit.  Anyway, that having been said, time for today's entry.  Unfortunatly, i have said all i have to say in my last entry, so i really have nothing.  I'll juss tell you how my day is so far.  Woke up at around 8 o'clock to the sound of my mom bringing in my guy-cat to the vets to get nuetered.  Stayed up for a bit more, then took a shower, which got rid of all my cold-like symptoms.   urlLink Sabby  the day before said he wanted to go to the gym today, which i was all for, so i got ready, and called him at 11:20, juss to make sure he was still on, no one answered, so i left a message (on his cell).  I call back at around 12:00, the time we were suppose to be leaving for the gym, and he picked up...turns out he's in tarrytown, and can't make it.  Me, being very optimistic said no problem, i was gonna go anyway, blah,blah,blah, *click*. end of convo.  But, me, also being lazy, just didn;t go, and decided to surf the internet once more for very amusing things, which brings me here, writing this blog.  Rob called, wants to get a meeting for OHS mole, and then we can WATCH the finale, and i think jones wants to start setting up the LAN Party.  thats basically everything that happened so far...absolutly nothing.  but, i have to say, all this time hasn;t gone wasted.  I recently looked at a bucha cheesy, sappy, horrible love poems i wrote about someone last year.  Looking back, i can;t belive i even did, but wtf, i had to let out my feelings somehow right? (ie: this blog) anyway, for archiving purposes, i'm going to type em' all out...but dun critizise me...most of these were wrttin at like 1 o'clokc..which is the equvolent of me being drunk...i  threw away the first 2 pages of songs, i forget why, but i did, so i'll just start from when they start.  They have no names either, it's kinda juss like on, long ass thing, and i think one is about a freinds love situation, but ya, that sums it all up, so here they are:   1  My dad says Ask them out first, get to know them later, i feel like the world is zach, and i'm AC Slater. i try to perform, maybe it'll be a plus but i'm making it worst, i feel like a dunce (wow, that was stupid)  i rush into relationships, but its not my fault there's a empty love in my heart, and it's about to be taught  i can see you looking at me, but i dun't know what you're thinking your sul is glimmering sunlight, mine is only glistening listening, ready for these words I can see you looking at me, everythought saturates my brain. your body is a masterpiece, let me be your frame (o yeah, thats one of my fav. lines)  ok, here they get alittle wierd:  2  it'll help me lift life the wieght from my chest but like everyone else, your taking another great person wraped up why do we do this? we know we like one another, yet we let it go perhaps you were waiting for me, but i just can't it would hurt me to much to find out that this love was just a fad be glad i suppose, you with someone that loves you you equally, head to  toe every second i think about it, it makes me want to yell,  the pain, the torture, the thought is hell i want to be with you, but right now i can't life's a boxing ring, and i'm up against the champ those signs you give me.. have you reached the next level? because you stare at me...infront of your significant other  3  I can see, your exactly like me thats why act like that same attitude....just let it be 2 seats back, one to the left, one seat foward, one to the right. everyday is a struggle to see you, everyday is a fight. it's right or should it be? you know i can see you, looking at me i want to go to you, and love you no more no less maybe your with him because you think there's no one else unfortunatly, thats not true, you have everyone else thats why i don;t stand a chance thats why i must learn to love you 10 feet away with a glance i can see you looking at me, your eyes a oasis under the son you speak poetry, beuty, it all rolls off your tounge  but it is done... next year it'll happen again, i hope i'll be the one i hope i'll be the one...   GOD DAMN, thats some sad shit huh? i dun remmebr writing HALF of that, but now, the whole world can see it.  The funny thing is, these things make it seem like i was alot more into this girl that i really was.  it was more lust than love...but wth, same shit huh?  well, alot of little things happened during this entry...my mom came home, which means i get to go to the gym! w00t! i haven;t been there in like 2 1/2 weeks, or something like that, so i really feel weak, which is making me wanna go real badly.  so i will, i'll give another entry when i get back home, which should be at like 12...but knowing my parents, they'll make me go to sleep as soon as i get home...i might also sleep over robs house tonight, but i doubt it...so yeah, i'll be at NYSC in Croton if ya wanna do something, i'll be there until 6, 6:30, so ya, after that, heading over robs, and after that, setting up for the LAN-A-THON, BOOYA!! wtyl peoplez ( write to ya laterz), PEACE!!! (*note* NOT THAT MANY TYPOS, W00t!!)
