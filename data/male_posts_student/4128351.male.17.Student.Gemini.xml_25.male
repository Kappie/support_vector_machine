Oh well, the wonder that is antibiotics will take care of that, if only I take them all.       Today was a weird day, I woke up like 34 times and couldn't remember what day it was. I woke up at 6 AM, 9 AM, 11 AM, 12 PM, and 2 PM. Then, I got a shower and fell asleep. I woke up at 3 PM. Then I called Jami. Soon after, I fell asleep. I woke up at 4:30 PM. I took a shower and was supposed to go to her house. But, I fell asleep. I woke up around 6 PM. I ate some soup and then we left the house and I fell asleep again. I woke up around 7:30 PM at Jami's. We layed around and then I'm pretty sure I fell asleep a few more times. I left her house at 12 AM.       I hate being sick.       I don't know what much else to say other than I'd write more if I wasn't asleep all day. Sometime I'm going to haul all my stuff up to the loft and me and Brice are going to set up camp in there. There'll be two empty rooms upstairs, but that'll be good since Mom is talking about adopting some Chinese baby or something.       I'm talking to Nick on AIM. He's cool as heck. I miss all those guys from GHA, although I don't miss the stupid classes, Lightning Bolt Boy, mirimba bands, and wearing that gay nametag.       I'm going to go get some sleep everyone, I need it.       Today's Song to Illegally Steal from Kazaa is: "Mother's Eyes" by Jump, Little Children. You might not be able to handle it, but I love it to death. Not as much as Jami, though.      Oh, I almost forgot. The Vote for Change Tour.       Dave Matthews Band   REM   Pearl Jam   Bruce Springsteen   Death Cab for Cutie   Bright Eyes      I've signed up to get advance tickets. Now if only I can see Wilco with Jamin then my life will be complete. Don't give your ticket to John, I'll drive to Norfolk, brother. Hah.       I'm out, y'all.       Keep cool my babies.
