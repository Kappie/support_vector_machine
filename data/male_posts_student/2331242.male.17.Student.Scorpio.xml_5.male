JD: I woke up this morning and walked topless out into the hallway  Martha:mmmmhhhhmmmmm  JD: yes, admire my one pack! I actually slept well, after I finally got to sleep. I think I mumbled something about Martha. I think her brother might have heard. I sure hope not.  Martha interrupting: u forgot to mention ur goodnight kiss...  JD: yes.... it was a good one. We sat on MarthaÂ´s bed after everyone was asleep and talked about the very bizarre conversation we had had a few hours ago. Then I kissed her goodnight. Unfortunately, I had to go back to my room...  Martha: then we ate breakfast...  JD: Zucaritas, to be exact. and apple pie. Yum. Then we went to see the neighbors and we gave them a miniature Christmas tree thingamajig. The little kid set off his toy helicopter in the house. And his car. And all his toys. Which did not help me to understand one word that was being said. Then we drove to Guadalajara.  Martha:  JD doesnt like long drives... but finally after an hour (thats soooo not long) we got to Guadalajara where we showed him house #1 and he helped us carry stuff out since we r moving out from that house...  JD: After that, MarthaÂ´s parents chucked us in a mall. We walked around for like an hour and a half. We sat down and talked about sex... AGAIN. I apologized for stumbling upon the topic. OK let me explain something. By "illegal," Martha meant dating. Being the guy, I immediately thought sex. So blame it on me. But hey. I know the law. We ate pizza, saw a lot of "cinturones de piel" (you guys might want to Babelfish that one), and I bought a cool hat that I will show you all when I return to Charlotte. Some of you might even be priveleged enough to wear it. Heh. Then they chucked us in a second mall.  Martha: JD was already crooked by then... his neck started hurting and acoording to him he looked like the hunchback of notre damme, but he didnt, he was as cute as always just with a shoulder higher than the other 1... he ate MY lime sherbert ad he threw away his vanilla ice cream... i think he only liked better mine bc i was the one spoon feeding him...  JD: I like lime sherbert!!!! Especially when cute girls feed it to me.... yummmmm.  Martha interrupting again: "yumm" the girl or the sherbert?  JD: both. we went back out to the car, I swallowed a double dose of neck pills, and we drove to house #2. It was under construction, so I just played with MarthaÂ´s pinky. Then.... the apartment. That was interesting wasnÂ´t it Martha?  Martha: yup.. and lets leave it at that...  JD: Your parents are nuts.  READERS: What the hell is that supposed to mean?  JD: That information is on a need to know basis....  READERS interrupting: wtf?! I need to know dammit!  JD: Tsk tsk, youÂ´re so nosey.  JD: Now weÂ´re back in OcotlÃ¡n. I played my iPod over her stereo while watching Jjjjoni Brrrrravo. I have big feet. Hobbit sized. Oh yeah, and Martha tried on an "ewwww" dress. I guess thatÂ´s it.  Martha: Random fact about JD: he only wears boxers when he sleeps!  JD: I feel liberated!  Martha. he is sooooo cute!!!! (OMG his orange pajamas...)  JD: and on that note, it is time for the orange pajamas to come off. Good night people!  Martha: yay! good night people...  JD: I luuvvvv uuuuuu  Martha: u know i luv u more  JD: I canÂ´t win....  FIN
