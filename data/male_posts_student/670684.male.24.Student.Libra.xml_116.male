I've seen movies transferred on Kazaa, and they look terrible and take forever to download, clogging up your usage and the other persons as well.    Edward Said, one of the most respected authors and historians of the last 50 years, has a short essay out where he points out the  urlLink endless contradictions  in George Bush's plans for war with Iraq.  This is getting to the level of preposterousness.  Few people want war...those who have stock in Boeing or Lockheed Martin I'm sure aren't upset about it, but most every person I've talked to is uneasy about war.  Yes, Saddam Hussein isn't a good guy, he treats his people like shit and lies.  Yeah, it'd probably be best if he were taken out of office.  But "shock and awe" in order to do it?  Diplomatic solutions seem so much more reasonable from every aspect; you don't kill innocent people, yet you show your care for the people of the Middle East.  Shock and Awe seems more inclined to show other Middle Easterners what is coming to 'em rather than a way to take Hussein out of office.    This has slowly become a catastrophic problem...for some reason Americans trust George Bush to act in the interests of people.  Why?  This was a guy who owned a baseball team...why should we expect some moment of transubstantiation when he is sworn in as the President.  He's still Junior Bush, the lightly educated guy who is way in over his head and grew up with a dad who believed in force and the Cold War.  Our foreign policy at present is downright pathetic, and getting worse.  We are becoming the rogue nation in the world.  And the people of this country don't understand it because we have a blind trust in all things Government...stand up and sing  America the Beautiful !    For anyone who is on the fence about war, and believes that George Bush will do what's right because that is what Americans do, I suggest reading Howard Zinn's  urlLink A People's History of the United States .  We don't need war, and don't let silly propaganda and duct tape scares let you think otherwise.
