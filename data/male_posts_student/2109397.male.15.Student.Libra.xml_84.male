Lots has been happening.   Tuesday was United tryouts. That supposedly went well depending on what way you look at it. In the beginning we divided up into who was on the B team and A team the year before and the people who didnt play the year before I call them the "newbies".  So the newbies and the A team were playing a full field scrimmage and the B team went to a smaller field and played around. That was fun because it was just like practices which werent necessarily fun it was just cool to be around the old team again. So then it was our turn to play the newbies. Derek started out in the goal and I just stood around until it was my turn or whatever. But Derek was being a selfish ass and wouldnt let me play. So until after they got like 7 shots on him he switched out. I aint do nothing either. Then the A team came on the field and we played them. I made one decent save and had nothing else to do. Then I switched with Derek. Bratso who is the A team coach yelling for me to come over to him. He coached us for like 1 half of a game of which I played goal in so he had sort of seen me before. And so he was like "What position do you play in the field?" and I said I dunno and he was like well where would you want to play in the field and I said I guess forward. And then he said "See I can't get you in goal but here and there, but if you want to go out and play field I can look at you there." I responded saying that I intended to only play goal. He said ok and made me go in for TJ who is the A team goalie.  After one sliding save and one other touch of the ball tryouts were over. After them I was hanging around with Gpaul and Samo and Muhammed yelled over at Sam and was like "Get him, whats his name? Get him" and Sam was like "Brian?". They called me over and TJ, Bratso, and Muhammed were standing there and then Muhammed started talking. He said something like "We want you to be a part of the A team, would you be willing to accept a spot on International team?" I thought to myself "UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM" it was sort of a surprise except for the whole thing Bratso said/did in the middle of tryouts. So I was like "Yea" and he goes how sure are you and I said 75-25. He went on to tell me how much of a commitment and shit it was and how I would be working with Tabani and crap. And I was like yea I know and so on so forth. So basically what they wanted was soemone who was decent enough to challenge TJ for playing time on the A team. It was kinda cool being singled out like that, especially being at the first tryout. So I asked them to give me until Thursday to decide.  Fucking hell was it a hard decision. I didnt sleep normal, like when I tried to go to bed I couldnt sleep so I ended up falling asleep around 6am for 2 nights. I was a wreck and worse off I had no fucking clue wtf I was gonna do. I mean it was the A team. State runner up, National League, lots of stuff. BUT, playing on the B team last year was an assload of fun, and I had alotta homeys on the B team.   I went in Thursday with no idea wtf I was going to do. He picked sum people to play in a scrimmages so most of us got a little break to sit and chill. We played a bit, I made like one dive and like nothing else. And then Bratso put in a whole new squad and it was basically the B team so I was like this is chill now I can yell at people. And like right at the end Jeff netted on me even though I got at least 4 fingers to it. Bratso called everyone over and he said some little speech and he was like I'm selecting 22 players that I want to see. So he did so. I was picked alongside Lucas, Jeff, and Josh from the B team. He took Griffin my homey and some other Mockingbird player. And the whole A team from the year before minus 3. And like 2 other newbies. Some of the people I didnt tell were like look at Brian amking the A team blah blah. We had a lil 11v11 scrimmage and then Bratso made his final cut. Muhammed was there to watch and was like have u decided about what we talked about on Tuesday and I said no. I felt like a douche saying that and then Bratso was naming off people and he took Griffin. So I was like well.............. and then I just decide alright I'll do it. So Bratso asked me if I had decided and I said yea I'm playing. And so there you have it. I am now a member of the 89 United Internationals. Woot.  And so my dilemna was supposedly over. I was relieved that I had made up my mind. But then I found out that the B team was basically the same people as last year. I was like oh well. Then yesterday we got an email from the A team manager and it was asking me to sort of officially accept my position on the team. It sort of made me regret my decision. For some reason. I just thought that you know the B team would be fun and its not as much pressure. But I had basically already committed so I wasnt going to back down and sent her a conformation email. So................ I still sort of regret saying yes to A, but I think its really cool I actually made A. But who the fuck knows. I have 4 months to get in the best shape of my life and work my ass off to get playing time. I think I'm up for it. I wish I knew whether playing Ballard would help me get in shape for it more than just doing A LOT of shit myself. I guess we will find out when I tryout.  I'm going to camp in like a day which sort of sucks but not really because it's gonna make me get started. It's pretty fun most of the time too, so it will be cool.  Nothing else really happened except I got tricked today and the littel faggot fucks who are behind it are gonna die, but they already have it coming for them so I dont even have to bother doing it myself.  Peace out yall  I think this is my longest post haha.
