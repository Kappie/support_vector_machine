Then when they ordered they had British accents. It was confusing. Later they were being affectionate at a table, and it gave me fuzzies.  It made me realize how, for being smack-dab in the middle of the Bay Area, you never see any gay affection in Palo Alto. It's frickin annoying. I mean, come on! That was easily the first time I'd seen anything like that here. Still haven't seen any gay men being cozy downtown. Freaky.  So I plan to be very busy over the next few days, so that I have an excuse to not sit around on the Internet all day. Which I'll probably be doing, just not at home. Now that I have my laptop, I plan on bringing it with me everywhere. Everywhere reasonable I mean. So it will definately be coming to Montara with me, as pointless as that may be. I think I might load a few games on it before I go, since I doubt I'll have Internet access there.  I want Foothill to start. Specifically I want to be in Japanese again. And Introduction to Middle Eastern Civilization should be awesome because everyone in the world seems to be planning on taking it. I think I might be in Ryan's Orientation to College and English, too. That'd be exciting, though I hope I manage to get some work done with him jumping on me every five seconds.  There is some weird super-hero movie on that I don't recognize. It has Catherine Zeta-Jones wearing a fur coat, and the main character is some guy in a tight maroon suit and some stupid Batman eye covering thingy. Stupid. I would ask what this is, but I'm not sure I want to know.  I bought the Kill Bill soundtrack and a sexy carrying case for my iPod. Some of us are just more stylish people than others I guess. Dinner time, goodbye.
