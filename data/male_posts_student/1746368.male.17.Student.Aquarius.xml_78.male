In fact, he said it was something I should be doing. Anyways, I got the next book in the "Left Behind" series (The Mark). Not that interesting so far, but that's how most books are. I finished the book before it, and that was supposed to be my book for the month. Anyways, I don't actually have to read for the rest of this month. Me being me though, I am going to read more. I actually have to finish the series and then read like a 1200 page book afterwards. Mr. Taber (teacher) wants me to compare the two series. Anyways, (heh, that word shows up every once and a while) I went to the library today and got the book. It took me like 5 minutes for a round trip total of 10 minutes.  Tomorrow is my make-up day. I have to make up all the work I missed last Friday, since this is the first day I have had the same classes as Friday. Luckily I have no seventh period, so I can get my work done then.  Retraction: I may have said some things in previous posts that were out of line. I was being a jerk and not very considerate of other's feelings. Please, you know who you are, forgive me. This person may never see it, but this is the right thing to do. I'm sorry.  1: New teacher. The old teacher got bumped or something. I don't know. This is my TA class (Tech Assistant, as a reminder). She doesn't have a clue what to do. I played my GameBoy.  2: Web-Page. The teacher was extremely disappointed with our  urlLink Sports Pages . Since we (we being my partner and me) did everything we were supposed to, we played a game of chess, then played some old arcade games. Much fun.  Lunch: The usual, talked about games; played my game; talked about more games; watched Lenny run after Chris (my partner in web-page; see page, then see "About Us"). The usual.  3: Yawn. No really, I fell asleep while everyone was reading. Then I woke up, and the teacher had just asked a question. Everyone kept on yelling out random answers, I looked at a portion in my book, and got the answer right. Stupid classmates, don't really know anything. It's pretty sad when a half-awake gamer who doesn't do his best work when just woken got the answer while others were sitting there yelling "Stonewall Jackson" (the question was who came to watch the "First Battle of the Bulls"; the answer was the civilians, not Stonewall Jackson).   Hah, Steve is getting mad at me because I keep explaining my jokes.  Anyways, the "Site o' the day" is Gamestop. It's pretty cool if you're remotely interested in video games. You can find all the games you ever needed. By the way, there seems to be some confusion about the "Site o' the day". Click on how I am feeling (not the right mood, but the word after "Feeling:"). That will always hold the link. See you later. Here is the ending quote, which is now my favorite quote, ever. Religion is man's attempt to reach God; Christ is God's attempt to reach man.
