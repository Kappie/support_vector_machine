It must have been some lunch ladys dropping something... but it was weird.  Nothing really to say.  Umm, how about I leave you a picture.  Everyone posts pictures on their blog.  Why not mine?  Ok here's a picture when we went down to Des Moines to check the SRT-4.    If it doesn't fit on your screen, too bad.  Get a better monitor or up your resolution.  Right click the desktop > Properties > Settings tab > Screen resolution.  Have a nice day.
