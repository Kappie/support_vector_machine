The dehumanizing drudgery of the so-called successful life can be seen in Patrick Bateman's life. He's just like everyone else around him, and everyone else around him is just like him. His brutal killing spree and rampant sex to me in such an environment says to me that the movie adapted from a book has a class commentary aspected to. It's a twisted movie, but very interesting.  ***
