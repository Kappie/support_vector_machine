Peter Parker is role model, a man who is willing to sacrifice what he wants for a greater cause.  Mary Jane Watson shows us that your sixth grade crush might turn into love someday, that you should never give up your innocent dreams.  Harry Osbourne shows us that villians are people too, that we need to watch out or we too might sink to depths we thought unimaginable.  Spiderman...Spiderman...He does what any spider can.
