When you cast your eyes upon shabby workmanship and botch-jobs 'par-excellence' the creative juices within you begin flowing. Several mis-placed, badly managed oddities strike you as being somewhat alien in your surroundings. The eye-sore aliens created such anguish, we had to proceed in extraditing them to pastures new. The large bush down the bottom of our alley. The local dump. And into the fire, banished from existence, neutralized from being. What went? The green fairy-lights pinned to a central beam in the living room, celebrating the arrival of Christmas, yet still in place come June. Destination; unknown. 2 brown armchairs that were dismantled with great care on our patio in the back garden. Excellent firewood. Having heaved around 2 tons of pure junk from behind our rotting shed, I was kindly informed by the Landlords, not to go near the white sheets, not of innocent lasagne, but deadly Asbestos. Our removal mission had come to a premature end.  Apart from all the throwing away and burning, there has been several other battles to be engaged in. If you have ever attempted to remove three layers of wallpaper, from a room the size France, with old knives and wooden spatulas, then my friend, you earn the utmost respect of your fellow worker for clean walls. The principle at work in applying several layers of wallpaper,one on top of the next, is the principle of haste. Everybody knows that removing wall paper is most pain-stakingly slow work on the planet. So, in an effort to save time, you paste new onto old and do a runner. It grieves me.  I can vouch for the fact that removing wall-paper will induce a cathartic sensation if approached in the right frame of mind. Purpose driven endevour, that takes a task to its completion will reveal the glorious transformation that has occurred. Showing what is, for what it is, without hiding defects under a facade of luxury. When the wall-paper peels of in enormous sections, coming clean off the wall, leaving but an echo of the ripping sound hanging in the air, you begin to fathom the simplicity of pleasure. A pleasure that does not let you down, sting like a viper, leave you empty, and linger as a temporary happiness. When I subdue myself, stop the chase, and end the pursuit for gratification. Something wonderful happens. I find joy. In being, using my hands, and labouring for a cause.  What I see, if I see correctly, is days where people expect much pleasure, loving pleasure for the feeling it creates, chasing it to avoid stripping wall-paper. Stripping wall-paper is boring, rarely does it excite or raise the adrenaline levels, slowing you down in your search for the instantaneous amusement. Postmodern culture has an engine room that generates powerful messages as to how in effect enjoyment is played out. The over-riding value is fun, inviting us on the roller-coaster of playfulness, trivialising anything serious as nonsense. Anything you do can be laughed off, the gravity of your actions minimized, in the name of 'Having a laugh' or participating in a bit of 'Piss taking'. Everybody has to play the game, the rules are known, and nobody is allowed to be offended or get hurt. The instrument for the postmodern message of deception, takes pride of place in most living rooms, spewing out endless images of counterfeit happiness, and shallow materialism propagating the urgency to accumulate.  Alcohol is fun. The telly told me so. WKD or wicked is skillfully advertised, pitched on the market to satisfy your average fun-fiend. Getting your friends trousers wet around the crotch area, in the toilet of a club, while he is having a date is amusing. It sells wicked. Better still, the real practical joker, prankster of the highest order, should be caught cleaning in the buff, when his friend brings his lady around for the first time. Priceless. Then there is the Bacardi cat. Who hits the boulevard and is an instant success with the most gorgeous women in town. The Bacardi you see, makes you irresistible to the opposite sex. Bacardi increases sexual prowess, therefore, the more I drink, the more cat like I become, all the while the women find me harder to resist. Fun is it not? Headaches, hangovers, hangings, fights, date-raping, liver disease, obesity, sexually transmitted diseases, abortion, drink-driving, red-noses. Not so fun any more. But hey, who would like to curtail your freedom. Turin Brakes: 'Have another drink my friend, smoke another cigarette'.  In the age of playfulness, when public discourse turns into a joke, where everything becomes blurred and loses meaning, we can be liberated by driving a Peugeot 306 chabriolet. Apparently it releases the hero inside yourself. Whereas, women are set free by 'Body Form For You', by simply positioning a slim-line panty-liner in place, period troubles are over. They leap on bear horse-back and ride into the distance in a cloud of dust, returning for a Judo bout followed by skipping along in a field of yellow tulips. Products have become our salvation. Materialism our freedom. To make a statement, be sure to wear a communist red USSR T-shirt, without knowing Stalin or the essence of communism. Postmodernity allows offence while advocating an individual freedom to chase the tail of pleasure. Never to catch it. Always eluding. We keep on chasing.  Chasing pleasure is futile! Neurologically it overloads the brain's pleasure centres and depletes your feel-good neurotransmitters, serotonin and dopamine. Psychologically it creates unrealistic expectations and boredom. Physiologically, over-indulgence in anything creates tolerance, addiction, and health problems.  There is still a few tough spots upstairs. I wander whether I should use the chisel? If I leave it rough, I won't have to sand, to have it smooth, It will take another 2 hours. Pure Hessian or Golden Blossom? Why is wall-paper so difficult to remove? Maybe I'll get Britney and Christina round, fill the Jacuzi with Krystal and throw a wall-paper stripping party? The Bacardi cat could do portering. Hanging up coats, washing dishes, parking cars... Can't let him on the dance-floor!
