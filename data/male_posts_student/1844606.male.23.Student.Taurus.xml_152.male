My roommate did leg work today, figured out it might be 75 for a guy just to come out, despite the fact the contstruction workers are at fault for killing the line.  This has lead to a monumental decision.  One I've dreaded.  The possiblity of having a cell phone.   God damn it.  I'm adding telecommunication giants (SBC cough cough) to my official shit list.  If I do get a phone, I want it to be one of those big honkers, like at the beginning of the Hey YA video.  Not cause it was in the video, because having a phone that big just mocks all those other fucks who can't live without their phones.
