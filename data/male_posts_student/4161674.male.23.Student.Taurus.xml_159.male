Through an 'exclusive agreement' between Yours Truly and your Gizmonic Webmaster, I have arranged to post all of my column entries for The Chautauqua Region WORD here on The Experiment House blogsite. Of course, you're always welcome to head over to  urlLink www.crword.com  and check out the latest issue of The WORD - it's an excellent source for local news - especially in regards to what's going on in the Arts of Chautauqua County.      I am writing a weekly column entitled "Reed's Rants  Raves". The following article serves as an introduction to what I'll be writing about each week. Be sure to look for new articles here each week.       P.S. I welcome any and all feedback. I have set up a special e-mail account for that very purpose. Write me at  urlLink reedsrants@hotmail.com ! I look forward to hearing from you.      ****************************************************************************************************************     "NOW THE TRUTH CAN BE TOLD"  I am a geek.  You know...that actually felt sort of good.  What the hey? I think I'll say it again. I am a geek.  Yeah...I've got to admit that felt sort of cathartic. - Sort of my 'coming out', so to speak.  Yep, it's true. - I AM a geek. Now I know what you're saying to yourself. You're saying, "Hold the phone! Isn't this the same cool and happenin' dude we see each and every weeknight on Cable 8 News? James Reed - the legendary local weatherman who always looks so dapper in his 'clothing provided by Sears'? The SAME James Reed who is SO hip it's a wonder his bum doesn't fall off? How could HE possibly be considered a geek?!?"  ...What? ...You're NOT saying that to yourself? Oh.... Um.... Never mind.  Now let's set our parameters here. I want you to understand that when I say I'm a geek, I'm NOT saying that I meet the classic definition of 'geekiness'. For example: I do NOT wear eyeglasses with duct tape holding them together. I do NOT own - nor have I ever owned - a pocket protector for my pens. I do NOT sit around reading comic books all day. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!) I have NEVER had a problem attracting a plethora of beautiful and desirable members of the opposite sex. ...OK, maybe I'll have to concede that last point, but STILL!  No, my friends. My geekiness is - at least in MY opinion - limited to the fact that I am a complete and utter 'pop culture' and media geek. For as long as I can remember, I have been addicted to TV, movies, music, videos, video games, etc. I also enjoy a good book now and then - especially if it pertains to the subject of TV, movies, music, videos, video games, etc. Yes, sir...a complete and utter Pop Culture Junkie!  Compounding and confounding my unfortunate condition is the fact that my personal taste in things of this nature often goes against the grain of what is considered to be hip and cool at any given moment. Now personally, I think this is a GOOD thing. Especially since I am going to be (primarily) writing about pop culture and media for my friends here at the WORD.  I've got to point out that if there's anything I've ever noted as being common to the columnists I've PERSONALLY enjoyed reading, it's that they're (a) opinionated, (b) fearless, and (c) not always in sync with the popular thinking of the day. - Given those parameters, I'm thinking I should have a pretty bright future in this endeavor!  Let me assure you that I have some very strong opinions when it comes to entertainment. When it comes to TV, movies, music, and so forth - I know what I like. On the other hand, I really know what I DON'T like! Just ask my fiancée if you don't believe me. She's had to suffer through the 'seizures' I suffer whenever a particularly annoying song assaults my senses from across the radio waves!  So I think we've pretty much got the 'opinionated' part covered. As far as being fearless and nonconformist, I'll let you be the judge. After reading my introductory column here, you tell me if I'm not pretty darn fearless! And I don't think it will take you long to realize that I am not always in step with the popular opinion of the day!Let's talk details, shall we? Many of these (rather sordid) details will no doubt be fodder for future columns. At the very least, they will no doubt inspire some rather heated debate amongst my readers!  For example...when it comes to television viewing, I'd rather watch a DVD of a crusty old Black  White episode of "The Avengers" (circa 1965) ANY DAY over your typical prime time network programming. One of my favorite channels on Time Warner Cable's new digital cable lineup (shameless plug!) is BBC America. I think one of the funniest people to ever grace the television screen was the legendary Benny Hill. I recently got downright giddy when I discovered that TV Land had a Sid  Marty Krofft marathon scheduled in their lineup. (You DO remember "H.R. Pufnstuf", right? "Land of the Lost"? "ElectraWoman  DynaGirl"? Classic stuff!)  Movies? Again, I go against the grain! I'm quite possibly the only person in the U.S. who thinks that the best cinematic James Bond was Timothy Dalton (circa the late 1980's). Despite THAT little factoid, my favorite Bond movie of all time is 1969's "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" - starring the virtually unknown George Lazenby as 007! - Go figure.  I'd rather watch the 1966 "Batman" movie - starring that paragon of strength and virtue, Adam West - than any of the misbegotten output of Tim Burton or Joel Schumaker in more recent years "Holy Bat-Guano, Batman!"  I also have a fondness for truly schlocky films of the horror or sci-fi variety. I just got done watching the lovely Melanie Griffith in a film she no doubt would like to expunge from her resume. Anyone ever seen the brilliant social commentary, "Cherry 2000"?  AND, let's face it, I may well be the only heterosexual male of my generation who actually loves the 1980 'roller-disco meets 40's swing-dancing' musical, "Xanadu". (And please understand that I mean no disrespect to anyone by that statement!)  As to the music scene, my tastes are widely varied. I can honestly say that I love all kinds of musical styles. ...Yes, even Opera and Country (to some SMALL extent). Shoot, I even like Disco!  As to what I listen to on a regular basis, well...lately the four albums by alt-rock group, Cake, have been circulating in and out of my CD player on a rotating basis. My favorite rock group of all-time is the widely-misunderstood Genesis - in all of its various permutations. And when it comes to romantic or 'mood' music, I have to confess to worshipping at the altar of the ever-suave Roxy Music front man Bryan Ferry. (Yeah, I know...most of you are saying, "WHO?!?")  If all of the above doesn't scare you off, consider this... besides my beloved Genesis, I happen to think that two of the most misunderstood and unjustly-despised music acts to come out of the 1970's are Electric Light Orchestra and Captain  Tennille. Don't EVEN get me started about Nick Gilder! (OK, sorry...that one might be a little TOO obscure!)  Anyways, before you turn away in total disgust (and before my fiancée disavows any knowledge of me), let me say that I'm not COMPLETELY 'out there'. I have been known to 'jam out' to such musical artists as Eminem, Jay-Z, Outkast, and Nelly. I can often be spotted watching such relatively normal shows as The Simpsons, America's Funniest Home Videos, and Spongebob Squarepants. (Oops...I did said 'normal', didn't I?!?) I have even occasionally been spied coming out of a theater where a major blockbuster was being shown. - In fact, I just saw "Spider-Man 2" and LOVED IT!  So consider this week's column as fair warning. Yours Truly is a complete and utter 'pop culture geek'. With that in mind, I've got a whole bunch of things to throw your way. I'll be bringing you reviews of new movies, music, and television. I'll be recommending some 'alternative media options' you may not have previously considered - including, of course, some of the whacked-out things I PERSONALLY enjoy watching or listening to.  I may even go more in-depth in trying to figure out just how it is I ended up this way! - In fact, I anticipate a column soon entitled, "Blame It On The Bat". - Adam West, you have a LOT to answer for!  So, welcome to the wonderful, weird, and wacky world of "Reed's Rants  Raves". Strap on your seatbelts, folks. It's likely to be a bumpy ride!
