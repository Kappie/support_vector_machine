I am complete now that I've found you...   That's from a song I know. [I knew I loved you - Savage Garden] I need a hug right now... dunno why. Blah... oh well. Oh my gosh... I forgot to mention! The other day, a guy gave my sister a flower! It was soo cute! He likes her so yeah. Cuteness~ I was like: "Oh my gosh! That's sooo freakin cute!" They're not together, but he has a crush on her and yeah... people... whoever's reading this, please do not say anything about it to anyone! You're not supposed to know. This is just in my blog 'cos I felt like putting it in here.   Nima. Perfect guy. Perfect guitarist. Perfect. Period. I'd write a poem about him, but I suck at poems so blah. Same with song. I used to write songs about before... like when I was all depressed and crap... but yeah.   Yeah, and all of a sudden, I thought of Pirates of the Carribeans. Hmm, I personally think that Johnny Depp looked better than Orlando Bloom in that movie. *cough*Julie*cough* Haha! Anyways.... but do you know who looks even better than Johnny Depp (whom everybody knows I think is hot)? That's right! NIMA! :) If I got to choose between going somewhere with Johnny Depp or going somewhere with Nima, I'd stick with going with Nima. 'Cos Johnny Depp's only a celebrity. Nima's a celebrity too... my personal celebrity. He's got his own little place right here. *points at own heart* ^^ Aww, don't you feel spesho? ;)   Do you know who I miss a lot, besides Nima? FELIS! I miss her so much! I wanna meet up with her! I bet she's sooo much taller than me! I'm short. Blah~ She's pretty too! Blah... and she's got better grades... blaahh! Heee hee~ Fav word: BLAH!  Wow... there I go with another blog. I seriously have NO LIFE! Oooh, I'm a NO LIFE-er. Ooh, you know what? I've already thought about what rides to go on... Let's see...  Dragon Fire Canadian Minebuster Psyclone Sledge Hammer Vortex Sky Rider Wild Beast The Fly The Bat Nightmares Jetscream  That's all I remember for now. Oh wait, and also the new Tomb Raider ride! Total coolness! ^^ But it doesn't matter what we go on... as long as I'm with Nima, it's all good! ^^ That's most important! Hee hee~ I wonder if the weather will be okay. Blah~ Gotta pray for it! ^^ I'm thinking about what to wear for Friday! Haha! Hmm it's pretty warm on Friday. Probably will wear my And One hoodie. I don't want to wear a jacket... too annoying. T-Shirt won't be warm enough anyway. Haha~   I love you ;)
