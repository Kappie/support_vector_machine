And after a few easy steps I set up my G-mail account. The special feature of G-mail is that it gives every user a 1000MB space! So there is no need to delete mails any more and I can store some mail with big size. My g-mail address is kenleung5e28@gmail.com.  This afternoon I'm still playing with Visual C++ Express 2005. I can mix .NET and native code in the same file, or even the same function! So, I can enjoy .NET and STL programming together. Both technologies are great! Thanks, M$! (It is the first and may be the last time I say thanks to M$.)  P.S. I've gone to McDonald's this afternoon and ate many food. My stomach is full now~
