I got there like 10 minutes late, and so the only computer left was one that wasn't booting properly.  But rather than make a big deal out of it, I just sat at that computer and for like an hour and twenty minutes pretended like I was typing and following all of the directions that everyone else was.  I would even make eye contact with the instructor guy and nodding my head when he asked if I was following and on the right page.  So after the hour and twenty minutes he walks behind me where he can see the computer and that it's not even turned on.  He asked if it just went out.  I said 'no.'  Then he asked if it had been off for the whole class.  I didn't know what to say, so I just said 'I guess so.' Then he just stared at me for a minute, and I don't think either of us knew what to say.  It was a pretty uncomfortable situation for both of us, and we may be able to expand on it a bit and make something funny out of it.  Also, the other day I was at this end-of-school party and there was this foreign woman there with a thick accent.  Only the accent would constantly change and sometimes seem british and sometimes french and sometimes some other shit.  I was gonna tell her that I thought she was only pretending to have an accent and that I didn't buy it, but I figured that would be rude.  But I definitely would have liked to.  Maybe some sort of situation like that could occur and one of our dudes could offend someone or something...
