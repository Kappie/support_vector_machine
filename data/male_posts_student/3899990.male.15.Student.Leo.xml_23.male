Then, we went and drove around the city of San Gabriel/Monterey Park. At about 1:00 PM, it was about time to go to the airport and check-in, go through all that security and crap. In fact, I’m writing this at the airport as we speak.  As a reminder, tomorrow is the “3 in 1” Party which will be hosted at Lisa’s house. Should you have any questions, please contact Lisa on AIM at GurLhtt14. More information about the part can be found at  urlLink http://walty.deltacs99.com/3in1party/ . I should also mention there is an update for the party:  - There will be no swimming for security purposes. Please still bring and/or wear your swim suit to the party because there will still be a water balloon fight! - In addition, if you decide you still want pizza, bring an additional $2.00. The party may or may not have pizza, but it’s always a good idea to bring money just incase. - We will be watching a movie,  The Exorcist , which is rated R. If you are not allowed to view this movie without your parents’ consent, please ask them before you watch it. If you are not comfortable watching, you may leave the party or do something else on your own time. - You may contact me with any details by e-mailing  urlLink mhswalt@hotmail.com  or feel free to IM me on AIM at LaLFaN979. [For people who know my other e-mail address, do NOT add this one to your address book. This one is only used for public uses, thanks]. - One last thing, I may or may not be able to make the party. If I can make the party, I may be a little bit late because I have some morning errands before the party starts. But, it shouldn’t be a problem at all.  I look forward to seeing all of you at the party!
