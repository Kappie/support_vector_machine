So I won't be in school Friday because of the funeral, Friday just happens to be the last Friday in school, the second day of the Spanish finals, the day I can get some extra credit with Wade (by missing math and talking about a book about fast food, and its horrors), a concert thing with Lemonsoul and North in Lemont, an oppertunity to hang out with some great friends and let myself completely forget about finals and school and all the crap I'll have to deel with come Monday...  Not to mension missing Friday would be the only day I've missed, making this year the first year that I would have gotten perfect attendance, not that I care but it would have been something to think about... not anymore.  But instead Mr Big Man Upstairs decides its time for my awesome cool PopPop to meet St. Peter at the big ol' Pearly Gates...  When people say God works in mysterious ways they are not kidding in the slightest.  Sometimes I wonder how people who don't believe in God can live with explaining everything scientifically... Conincidence is a word that takes the blame and the credit for some much... how can you accually think everything on earth and in the sky and everywhere just happenes to be and that after you die you cease to exist... what would you feel? Nothing? Then how do you know you're dead?  I don't know what to say to a lot of people's questions, but one thing for sure, stuff happens and it happens for some reason that will probly never make sense to you...  Stuff is crazy and I'd just like to let you all know, make everyday the best it can be cause there isn't much you can do about what life serves up about doing what you can is all that keeps you from complete animal insanity...  I'm not sure what thats all suppose to mean... The extra credit isn't all that big of a deal anyways, I'd need a 310 out of 200 on the World History Final to get an A for the year... so whats it matter anyways?  -Dan V
