As expected I got an A+ (102.1%) We took a "TEST" - 30 questions multiple choice, AND we got tpo bring in a page's worth of notes!!! easiest thing ever! Summer school is not 2 bad I have to say. It' sjust three hours a day, and we get time there to do the homework, so no homework. So the two major complains against school are eliminated. Finally all the things I ordered are coming in. This is the first time ever that I had a problem with buying electronics online. Hopefully the last too.
