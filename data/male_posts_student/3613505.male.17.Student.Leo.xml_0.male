THURSDAY   yeah lets start off on thursday - k she came to pick me up in the nicest car ever and we drove down to Jericho Beach, talked a bit - got to know each other a bit more found out what music she likes - turns out she loves all those animated movies like Finding Nemo... Monsters Inc. and such. It was really sweet - then I told her you know are you getting hungry so she said yeah - where should we go, so then we debated over it i kept insisting that she choose but she wouldnt so i said.. well... theres this really nice greek place on 4th (SYMPATICO) so  i told her yeah its good food and you'll really like it - so we went in sat down and talked about everything and nothing all at once - she has the most beautiful eyes ever - theyre green but they have light brown rings around the irises. Well after that we drove around downtown agan wondering what we should do and I told her ... well... we might as well go for coffee before we go back to the hotel room so we drove aroound and around looking for a Starbucks with enough parking (hehe its not exactly that easy with such a big vehicle) so we finally found it and I decide to have a cappuccino and she has a latte and we giggle around some more.... then we drive over to Stanley Park to drink our coffee and she tells me more about the story of her life and how her parents don't really like her and how they express it so bluntly -- it was kind of a bonding moment... then we headed back to the Four Seasons where she was staying, got a couple of beers from the mini fridge and sat down on the bed to watch some quality tv :-p  haha riiiiight  so we end up having a pretty cool makeout session but I stop it there - i know what youre thinking.....  no you didn't ... but, alas, I did. haha and umm yeah we had a really sweet good night kiss and I went on my way.   FRIDAY   The next day she picked me up again (it's easier that way.. shes the one with the vehicle) and we headed over to the Fairmont at the airport where she would be staying that night to check in. AFter checking in we went into the room to put her stuff away and uhh... freshen up :p haha okay it turned into a pretty long makeout session again but it was all very cool... haha it lasted for a couple of hours i think... anyways we got hungry so we headed over to a Japanese place she knows pretty well (apparently) and we had the all you can eat deal... and umm yeah that was fun there was a certain 'BET' that I will not go into right now hehehe oh i think i'll remember that anyways i had a really great time trying to eat with chopsticks and which my shaky hands made almost impossible - she actually asked for some cutlery for me.. argh... too embarrassing ... well she was a doll.. and i was a sweetheart :-) haha so then we decided to head over to the movies in Tinseltown to watch White Chicks because she had been on the set for a few of the takes and it was an overall funny movie. We held hands the whole time. and wow... the sexual tension just rose.... and rose....and rose. So by the time it was finished it was around minuit je pense.. but we ended up back in the hotel room hehe where umm... yeah... we had fun and such. I didn't get home until about 4 am and my dad came running down the stairs all freaked out hehehe very funny. I had a really great time.   SATURDAY   It was Saturday that she had to head back to victoria so we went out for a sort of Brunch I guess at Sophies Cosmic Cafe - I had a bowl of fruit and she had some big breakfast platter thing - we talked about our childhood and stuff (she went to a very strict catholic school run by nuns and priests) and we also discussed out disagreements with religion... blah blah blah.. all fascinating things actually... there i learned she wasn't exactly an artistic person at all which is fine with me because i guess I balance her off :) after that we went to stanley park again and we umm made use of the size of tthe Escalade  hahahahahaha  i love how witty and subtle i am. anyways we had a great time - then we had a frap and again she had a latte which really bamboozles me because it was sooooo hot that day - we went over to english bay and sat on a bench... watched people walk around ... got a little burnt by the sun and decided it was time to head back to the car. We picked up some blueberries from some grocery store and we said adieu -- then i went my way.... she went her's and  i didnt hear from her until later on that night near midnight when i got back from a basketball game with my homeboys haha yeah i'm ghetto i know... and we talked for a bit over the phone and then she had to go so we promised to see each other again. aww.. i really like her.. maybe this will be a start to something beyoooteeefool -- hope so.   SUNDAY   Nothing much happened sunday - woke up at around 5 because i'm a lazy bum and went over to school to supposedly play some basketball - turns out they were playing under the searing sun so i told them i was out of there - too much heat for me. they stopped too because they saw the stupidity of playing outside - saw christian at the bus stop.. argh that kid needs to live a little... hes stuck on joining the reserves and whatnot and hes trying so hard to lose weight but then hes just starving himself and its hurting him way more than it's helping - apparently he's passing out and stuff because he doesn't eat... blah... the boy needs help.. anyhoo after chatting with him for a while i headed over to hugh's for a bit - hung out - then headed over to the mcDonald's by the nightmarket to visit emily hah poor child has to work in the worst place ever. we couldn't even get into the nightmarket.. something must've happened and yeah so then we hung out some more at the McD's and then walked Emily home.... then I went home.. watched this really stupid movie called 'May'... read up more on my super long book.. 'Black House' and passed out   TODAY (MONDAY)   noooow that i have all of you caught up on the most significant recent events i must go shower or something.. clean up this giant mess and get my afro cut or something.. hair's driving me nuts. anyhoo i'll write in later today and update you all on my LIFE haha alright? yay... see you in a biiit!
