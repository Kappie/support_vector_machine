My brother was born about eleven months and three weeks before my sister, meaning that for one week every year they were the same age. I can vividly remember these from growing up, because for that one week my brother didn't have a little sister to beat up. He actually had to think twice, because he had to doubly justify his oppressive behavior. He would have to say something like "Nuh-uh, I'm still older than you 'cuz I was born first!" and she would reply "But I'm _x_ years old too so we're even!" Kids can't really get legal the way Johnny Cochrane can, so he was kind of stuck by this part of the debate. As a result, he would beat my sister harder than he usually did. Strangely, looking back on it I think she didn't mind as much, because for this once-in-a-blue-moon event she still had him, you know?
