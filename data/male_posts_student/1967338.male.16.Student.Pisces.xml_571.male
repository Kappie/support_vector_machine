I've learned important life lessons such as, wearing shoes without socks hurts after a few days, staying up to watch late night T.V. results in very unproductive mornings, and eating nothing but Trix and pizza is bad for you in many ways.  Well, that is all.  Only 2 weeks until my birthday,  YAY!  Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!
