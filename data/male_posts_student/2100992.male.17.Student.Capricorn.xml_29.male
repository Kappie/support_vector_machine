Now lets fast forward to yesterday. I was on my way over to Daves house and the pains (that I had from last week) kept getting worse and worse to the point I could barely walk. I went to the store near Daves house and just sat down on the curb for a minute and then went in and bought chips to bring to Scarrows. So I walked from the store to Daves where the pains got so bad I had to sit down in Daves house cause I couldnt move. It was the worst pain i've ever had. So this morning I got up and my mom took me to the hospital to see what the hell was going on. So first they give me a cup and a wetnap and the lady tells me to "wipe and pee" .. wipe what? ... I mean at first I thought she wanted me to wipe 'down there' but that didnt seem right .. so i just wiped my hands with it and went on with my business. So then they make me sit in this hospital room for so long and the doctor comes in to have a word with me and tells my mom to leave the room. Then the conversation went on like this ...  Doctor: so you have pains? Randy: ya Doctor: are you sexually active? Randy: no Doctor: are you sure? Randy: .. pretty sure Doctor: have you ever been sexually active? Randy: no Doctor: ok...  and then she just leaves ... doesnt say anything just leaves. So im thinking like "what the fuck is going on ... do I have like AIDS or something?" ... so after about another 25 minutes the same doctor comes back and asks me AGAIN "are you sexually active" so now im really thinking I got like AIDS or some shit ... then she tells me to take off my clothes .. which I declined .. ok maybe taking off my clothes was something I shouldnt have decline since it was a medical thing, but I dont think my wang has anything to do with stomach pains and I dont think I needed to whip it out for some doctor I dont know. So she checked 'the region' and then says she needs to check the urine sample again. So now the question I have is "did I not wipe correctly?" ... so ANOTHER like half an hour goes by and she comes in again and says "your urine is all clean ... i dont see anything wrong you can go home"   now wait JUST a minute here ... I spent 2 and a half hours here and your going to just tell me to leave and not figure out whats wrong ... I dont think so BI-ATCH. So my mom starts asking like "arn't you going to do like an x-ray or ultrasound to see if there is something wrong" and this bitch doctor is all "who's the doctor here? what's that going to do .. we checked his urine and nothing is wrong so if the pains don't go away come back later" and the bitch leaves. So I spent 3 hours in a hospital for them to tell me I have clean pee ... wow.  So now im sitting here at home, in tons of fucking pain, barely able to walk yet again tonight and im not going to waste another 3 hours in the hospital so they can tell me "you have clean pee" again.  What fucking bullshit
