Try #1:  I made it about 10-15 ft from the other side and then accidentally kicked the buoy line.  It sorta startled me and I turned and let all my air out.  Oops.  Try #2:  I made it about halfway across when I looked forward and there it was...  Brent's middle finger extended in my direction.  I laughed, and laughing underwater is a bad idea.  After that I felt like vomiting since I didn't eat any breakfast, but I eventually got over it... after swimming 400 yards and treading water for 10 minutes.  "A rose by any other name still smells like a rose." "What if it was called 'crapweed'?" "I would mind a bouquet of crapweed."
