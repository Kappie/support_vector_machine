I believe that the fact he does not update is virus database may have caused him harm. We got back to my house with the japanese. Wanderley introduced me to  Dungeon  Dragon . Totally awesome! I believe i will buy a set to play with my bro and friends when i get in  Canada .   Spoke with  Gatty  and she is sad, also she miss me a lot. I will not be able to travel to her city, it's quite sad. Downloaded  Doom II + Doom legacy + Doom Connector . Now i play Doom in  OpenGl  on the net, totally cool! Looks like  Euphemia  can't wait to see me! Men i feel the same!  Regards,  Zephyr
