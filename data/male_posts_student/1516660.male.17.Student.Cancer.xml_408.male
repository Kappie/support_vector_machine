I met Gloria and CQ at CCK. Actually, I met CQ on the train. We went to McDonalds to eat. Me and Gloria ate that 20-piece Chicken McNugget. Meow! How fulling.  Hmm. We were at school quite early. Ayiah. We are going there to measure our sizes and select a pattern for the costume. Hmm.   Well, the process was long and ardous. Actually, it wasn't that bad. We were measured here and there. The design for the guys were somewhat like Chinese communists. Well, not really. Nationalists more like. The collar only. The jacket would be black in colour, while the shirt will be a big pinkish. I don't know what design the girls are gonna wear (they are still designing), but their color will be maroon. According to the wishes of the teachers.  Right. Sigh! I want to throttle the necks of a lot of bodies. First hor, they said wanna go out. Then, last minute, due to some reason or two, all of them cancelled their plans on us. I wasted my moolah you know! I was also very annoyed at that Koo Wen Qiang. Sian dong sian xi! I feel like throttling his neck the most!   Okay. Enough of murdering cats. I went hme, and meowed. Okay. End of story. I don't feel like elaborating much today. Heh. See ya next time. Most probably not tomorrow, because I got SYF Opening Ceremony from 2 till late at night, and I got PW in the morning. Sigh. Saturdays are doomed dates for blogging. Right. Enough rambling. Night! Tata blog!
