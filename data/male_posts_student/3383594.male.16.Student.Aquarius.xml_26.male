I watched the match between England and France till 4:30am. It was stunning how France won the match in the last 3 mins of the game by scoring 2 goals. Haha, but it was overall a pretty good match.  I woke up at 1pm, skipped breakfast and waited for my lunch. I didn't go anyway yesterday as I was pretty tired after 2 days of staying up late. Haha, I managed to do some of my A Maths revision in the afternoon, b4 falling to slp again. L0L! But in the evening after my dinner, I went back to practising my A Maths. I watched the television frm 10pm onwards all the way to like 2am. The match between Denmark and Italy was at 12am and I wasn't going to miss it. My bet was on Denmark and I was hoping for an upset. It ended up in a nil nil draw, but I must say tt it was pretty entertaining! L0L!  Now, it's already in the morning and I'm waiting for the next match between Bulgaria and Sweden. My bet this time is on Sweden and I'm realli sure tt they will win this one. I checked the newspaper earlier on and I realised tt there will be The Amazing Race at 3am, so I'm going to watch tt as well. I dunnoe which season and episode it is, but I'll be switching channels here and there during tt time. So, tt's basically about it. The match is starting in half an hour's time, so I'll cya some other time ya? =]
