Whose Line  games ensued. Then Darren almost blew up Ian's computer. But he didn't. Went home. Ordered pizza. *shock  awe* Which, like, hardly ever happens.  Wednesday, wooork. Started out pretty normal till around 6 or 7, when it started  down pouring . It was vicious. But luckily, that didn't last to long, so business proceeded pretty normally. I'm planning on using my earnings for some anime DVDs. So hopefully, within a week or two, I should have the complete Cowboy Bebop and Escaflowne series. Whoo!  As far as comics went this week, I managed to complete a M-W-F schedule. With help from Mr. Catfish. ;) I have no idea what I'll use next week. I'd like to do every week day, but I might end up with M-W-F again. We'll see.  And that concludes my muchly abridged week!
