Lisa's being nice off late, at least she ain’t being a pain in the rear.   I've never been happier (well I wasn’t exactly happy, more of a sense of relief)to see £69.85 credited into my account. Least i have enough to survive forthis month.   My dissertation’s chugging along at a snails pace.   I’ve got work all week, dunno know if I’d go still trying to work out the math’s , so that I can attend only the required number of shifts and stay there and without getting chucked out.    urlLink http://obstacle-man.blogspot.com/   Dread going back home, I’d feel like a loser. I'm kind of getting used to my loneliness and if i do go back I’d have mum and dad around(yep I still live with my folks).   I still haven’t paid my rent for the month of Septemberor booked tickets, I guess I’m worried that if I book tickets something will crop up.  Got another call from another placement agent, asked me to get back to him once my dissertation's done.   I still haven’t kicked my gaming habit, I’m working on a P2 350 megs 192 MB RAM [ woooo hooooo .. I’m developing .NET apps on it] I cant seem to play Red Fraction (but I did manage to advance from one of the previous stages where I was stuck). I love the geo-mod technology used in the game. The game kind of, works on a 2x AGP card.   My Materialistic Wish List:  1: An XBOX and a Game Cube  2: Red Fraction 1 and 2, Dues Ex 1 and 2 and GTA3  3: N gage  4: A reasonably good PC so that I can play DOOM3  5: A Digital Camera  6:A mo-bike   Now, I'm addicted to the pinball machine (read game) that ships along Win XP. Wasn’t long ago when I was addicted to Space Impact II (Yep that old game that shipped with a Nokia 3510i.)     Artist : Blink 182  Song : Sometimes     Sometimes it seems like all I hope for  just gets thrown down on the floor  and then it seems like you don't love me anymore  sometimes I wish that I could run away  sometimes I wish I just had something to say    [I’m trying really hard not to miss her.]   WOOSh's lifes getting better. Her life and C's life usually head along a parallel path .  I'm not gonna txt C , till she leaves me an offliner or two.I've been staying away form the internet too. Councelling, doesnt really help a lot. You just go there and speak about everything under the sun. I'm beginning to doubt my councellor. I guess I have just attended my last session yesterday.   Tomorrow's gonna be a new day.
