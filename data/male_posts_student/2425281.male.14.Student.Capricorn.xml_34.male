My friends will know what im talking about. So I'm grounding myself to study.  RICE!! The food, the event! RICE 2004 is happening on the 10th July 2004 at Willoughby Town Hall and its going to be bigger and better than last year! A night packed with singing, skits, talk, testimonies, fun and socialising. A time to learn more and get to know God!   It starts at 7 p.m. on the second Saturday of the school holidays, next to Willoughby library. Visit the site  urlLink   for more info, ask me, Doug or Ben at school or talk to me on MSN.  I'll be back. See you soon
