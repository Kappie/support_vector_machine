Tomorrow at TRHS  Tomorrow I'm having my senior pictures done.  I'm not too thrilled about it, since that baby tooth that I had to have surgically removed last year STILL hasn't grown back, leaving a nice big ol' hole in my mouth (damn dentist, always screwing everything up).  But, oh well, it's only a picture.  I'm also selling yearbooks all day tomorrow, I have to go and get my brother's schedule, and locker, and all that other stuff because he's "too cool to go to orientation..." stupid kid.  Well, I'm not showing him where his homeroom is on the first day when he gets lost.  Same thing with his locker.  He can just find it himself.  I just hope Mrs. Yearbook Advisor knows that I'll be taking that 15 minutes to do that tomorrow.  I'm supposed to be selling the yearbooks, but my parents said "well, since he doesn't want to go to orientation, you just go to his homeroom and get his schedule, his locker, and all that other stuff."  So now I have to do it.  Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing it, because I'm just not that nice.  Haha.  Whilst I'm selling yearbooks, I'm going to work with InDesign and begin the official layouts for my section.  I gained a little bit of knowledge on the program today, and I'm starting to understand how it works.  Heh, if I didn't have to go home, I would have stayed on Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's laptop for quite a long time working on it...I'm addicted to it.  Just like Blogger.  I'm addicted to Blogger.  The official layouts are going to be completely different this year, just like I said today.  I have ideas on what I want to do, but they are going to require a new level of quality, as far as pictures go.  But, I have confidence in Melissa and the staff this year to do so.  Anyway.  I'm getting an early start tomorrow, going to chill in guidance until 8 (have to get there at 7, either that or I won't be there until 10:45 again, and I HAVE to be there by at least 9).  While I'm in Guidance, I'm going to try and do some work on InDesign from there.  In fact, since I have Guidance this year, it gives me an idea... when I am not doing any work in Guidance during my class period, I think I'll go get the laptop from Mrs. Yearbook Advisor and work on my stuff from there... that's not a bad idea, actually.  Good for checking stories, importing pictures, and all that other good stuff... I'll discuss it in my next meeting with Mrs. Yearbook Advisor.   Today at TRHS  Today went alright... like I said this morning, I wasn't going to go in at 6:30 this morning like my dad wanted to do...so I got there at about 10:45.  That can't happen tomorrow.  Anyway.  I got there, immediately got the laptop, quickly threw something together for Adam, and then got to InDesign...and sold yearbooks.  Saw a bunch of my friends that are sophomores this year today, like Adam, and Jessica, and Amanda T. (though I don't think we classify as "friends").  Me and Alex sat there, saying stuff about Jarrod when he walked in the door to get his locker, and also playing with InDesign.  Alex actually caught on quicker than I did... Mrs. Yearbook Advisor needs to know that, because if he can do stuff with InDesign, then he may be a key asset to the book once computer nerds like me and Adam leave at the end of this school year.  Anyway.  Today was alright, but, I had to go sit in my mom's office for two hours afterwards, because she was on the floor and couldn't take me home.  And that sucked.  But, oh well, it went by somewhat quickly.   It Shall Not Be Forgotten  This year, like I've said before, I'm not forgetting my birthday.  It's not going to be hard, since its exactly one week after FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH.  August 20, to be exact.  I don't know if I actually wrote what happened last year... anyway, I completely lost track of time, to sum it up, and even though I was filling out the date on receipts for the senior breakfast, I never caught on to the fact that it was my birthday, until my guidance counselor had to remind me during my 4th period Guidance class last year...wow, did I feel stupid.  And that became known as my klumsiest moment of all time...at least, in my book, it did.  Rest assured, Bagel will not be forgetting his birthday this year.    Still no Gmail Stuff Yet...  This confuses me...it was originally going to be less than a month, and I still have not received Gmail invites for my giveaway.  Maybe Gmail is about to launch the official version, and they aren't giving any more invites.  If thats the case, than this contest is screwed...until I find something else to giveaway.  So, stick with me, and hopefully I'll have more information soon.   UCF: The School I Definitely Want to Go To  That's right.  The decision has been made, just like Adam made his decision (I thought about making that decision 2 years ago, though).  UCF (University of Central Florida) in Orlando is the school that I want to go to after graduating next May.  And, just like Adam, I want to go into journalism.  He wants to go into TV journalism, I guess.  I don't.  Print journalism is what I want to do, and I'm going to minor in teaching, just like I had originally planned.  So, basically, I'll probably copy Courtney and be a journalism/English teacher.  And I also want to do a magazine, or a newspaper.  But, UCF will definitely be that school that I learn it all at.   Well, that's about it for tonight.  I probably won't be posting anything tomorrow morning, and I'm going to be gone for the majority of the day, so the only expected post tomorrow should be something.  But, probably only one post.  I've got a busy day ahead of me tomorrow.  I'll be at the school for about 12 hours.  But, it'll be good for my community service.  I'm doing so much of it, that my 250 hour goal should be accomplished before the end of 2004.  Then I can work on 300 by May 2005.  Anyway, that's it.  Bagel is checking out.  See ya.
