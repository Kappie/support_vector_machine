Also because it bears repeating,  Start Your Own Blog.   In unrelated news, Break A Leg, Erin! And Massive Props to Marten!  In a completely unsurprising twist the italicization of the blog can be attributed to one Marten "Glutenous Polypeptide" Dollenger. See my post "I am on my way. When I am manifest, our work begins..." wasn't italicized when I posted it. But it was after Marten posted his silly post. So it's all Marten's fault.  Also Comments are down until I get back from Chicago. Sorry!
