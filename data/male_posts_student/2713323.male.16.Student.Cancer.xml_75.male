Serious. 4 periods of chinese, again. Talk cock the usual, its starting to get boring though. I went down to ask Mr Teng for my chinese results, and i bumped into grace's good friend from 5n1, dunno whats her name. She asked me, "eh? why are you here? i tot u don't need to come to school till 10.30?" i replied, "huh? can meh?" she said, "yah..the people in my class didn't come to school, they're coming at 10.30, Mdm Ong said they could." So i asked Mr Teng whether i could come to school at 10.30 tml, and he said, ok, check with mrs pereira (of course he spoke in chinese, i shall not attempt to hanyupinize). So i checked with her during recess and she said, ok, tell Natasha too. Den after school during art, shawn came to look for me and we had to go see Mr Ong, and i almost got into trouble cos Mdm Ong said she didnt let the 5n1 go early, and she gave me that bitchy look omg i feel like slapping her face. In the end, the whole thing turned from a mole hill into a moutain, and we took like half an hour to solve it. In the end, Mr Ong said, ok we will come to the decision tml. doh...well, i hope i can come late on thursday and fri. that would be \m/. Ryan was supposed to go out with yy after art, i dont know what happened, ryan didnt say, so i'll just leave things as it is. no touchy touchy jah? neehows, i went for lunch with eden and jon at bayshore, tok cok, did some stupid things which were quite fun actually. Oh yeah, i owned someone of msn yesterday, she added me with the add, mashimaro something. and she asked me who am i. god i hate these people. so heres the entire convo.  Her : ELOX crüe: hi..
