I followed my call to study at college here in Sydney Auz, I am now two terms through my first year with one remaining. I am activly involved with both the childrens ministry and 68 the junior high school programme. we are seeing tremendous blessing, and I seen God strech me and shape me so much that if i went home now I don`t think people wuld see the same person!!  anyway this is meant to be a short introduction, hopefully I can encourage you to keep on going in the faith and believing Jesus. if you donÂ´t know Jesus why not ask him into your life, all you have to do is follow this link  urlLink http://www.ccci.org/wij/index.html   anyway my aim is to be able to add a diary of how God is changing my life on a daily basis. please come back for more......  bye and God bless
