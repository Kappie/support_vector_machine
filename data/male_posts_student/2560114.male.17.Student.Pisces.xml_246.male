Well this year, must been a crappy school year...also the longest. During the beginning of the year, life was jus something i thought about when im extremely bored...like love...When i finally got that feelin, i thought it was the greatest thing in the world and nothing can go wrong...but it did, everything that i could imagine went wrong...but i kept on tryin. I kept on fighting for what i believed in, for what i thought was right, for what i thought was the best for both of us...but the pain jus kept on building up until i finally was on the brink of doing something terrible to myself...but i kept on tryin...my mind and my heart kept on having battles, i want to believe in one thing but then i try to do another. Throughout this year, i have been living in depression, sadness, and anger...i thought my life was meaningless and hopeless...i thought the fighter inside of me died and became cursed...it was a stage that i will never forget, it was a stage that i have learned greatly from...even when i tried to let go...the feelinz somehow find its way to linger back in my heart and effect the mind...when vball season began...it was another battle for me to face. On the court, no one could touch me, i couldnt b blocked, i couldnt b dug, i was a monster that didnt care about anything except for destroyin my opponent...then once im off the court, i was the most vulnerable person in the world...my happiness after winning a big game quickly turned into the worst depression i have felt...throughout this season, we have experienced some big successes and for the moment i felt happy about them, but then afterwardz i jus dwelled on my depression and my patheticness and wishing that i would b wit her...wishing that somethign were to happen to turn my entire outlook of life around...i needed a savior...when we went into the playoffz, i have decided to ignore those feelinz until the season is over...for 3 weekz, we have had great successes...i having 17 killz against montebello, having 11 killz against west torrance, having 9 killz against sante fe, and finally having 12 killz against orange lutheran...after when the last ball hit the floor and gave orange lutheran the beginning, the first thing that ran in my head was..."damn...its over...its finally over". It meant that the next day, i have to face those problemz again...i cried...it was a sad day...i thought that nothing good is ever going to happen to me...i thought that, "now its jus pointless to continue...vball is over". It was one of my lowest pointz, but then something that i least suspected happened...the following thursday, i started talkin to stephanie online...since i had nothing to lose, i gave it a shot...then we started talkin somemore and it became on of the most happiest momentz ever...then for like 3 or 4 weekz now...we started to know each other better and i began to really like her...then it jus hit me...my feelinz for that one girl were gone...they disappeared, and now the are all focused on stephanie...the first thing that went in my head "man, hopefully the bad doesnt come again...or else i would lose it."...but it didnt come...everyday my feelinz for steph grew stronger and everyday i began to get happier...when i thought life was pointless, she came to me...she saved me from my dispear...and i thank her greatly for that...now, im the happiest person ever man...its feelz so great...and she also has the same feelinz for me...and its a beautiful thing...from the worst thing that can happen, to the best thing that can happen...this year was full of upz and downz and full of suprises...so to wrap this up...this year was the crappiest year ever!...but it had a hell of a great ending...love ya ppl for bein there to support me this year and thnx for all the help, i hope my experiences and my advice were helpful in ur time in need...thnx for still bein my friend even if my stubborness over took me...haha...i especially thnk stephanie...for finally rescuing me from this curse that i have thought i would never get rid of...but u helped me do it...love u...have a great summer ya'll!...o yeah...the saga continuez...
