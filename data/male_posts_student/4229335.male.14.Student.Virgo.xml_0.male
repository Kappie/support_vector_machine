If you have to go to the bathroom, do it now. This is going to be a long one.  At first, there was one. Then two. Then many many more.  Blogs are everywhere now. On the news, in books, and in movies. Everyone seems to have his own opinion on everything and everyone seems to think his life are important enough to warrant a website dedicated to him. I  hate that. I hate the seemingly conceited nature of bloggers. Who gives a fuck? Who gives a fuck what you like or dislike? Who gives a fuck if you think orange juice is better than apple juice?  I thought that blogs were a fad. Instead of enervating, blogging grew stronger and stronger. I was surprised but I guess it was inevitable. America is all about expressing yourself. With the growth of the internet comes the growth of free expression. Blogs provide an outlet for "creative" minds. Too bad...I still hate blogs.  I feel guility looking at blogs by people I don't know very well. I get an inside look on somebody's life while remaining anonymous. Kind of like a stalker. Yeah, I overthink everything. It's a curse. Blogs are also a waste of time. Especially chick blogs. Goddamnit. wHy tO deY tyP3 lykE diS? Enough to make me want to shoot myself. Why do people reply to their own jokes by typing "hahaha" in their posts? Don't insult my intelligence by telling me when to laugh. The hate continues...  Yes, I'm from Temple City. No, I'm not a Christian like 99% of the town. I will go into the Christianity issue some other time. The point is, I don't agree with many people and I'm fustrated that I can do nothing about it. An one-sided battle is unfair so here is my weapon. My own blog. Fuck you all.
