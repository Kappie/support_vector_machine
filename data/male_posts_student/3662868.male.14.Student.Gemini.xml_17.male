It's funny how many things in life we let pass us by... Anyways...I've been writing this story...I'll post a link to it later, but I finally finished a story that I worked on for like, ever, and it feels really good to know I actually didn't abandon my latest work.   Sifting through my old stories today, I've found that in the past few months, I've written so much stuff just for the hell of it...So many story lines that I've given up on, or forgotten about. I could start writing now, and not finish untill sometime next year. But I won't do that.   Well, I'm gonna go finish that cake, get some milk, and then probably finish typing up that story, so I can post it on my website and stuff. Mmmmm....cake....mmmm...ass and titties....mmmm....Oh Right...cake...
