The old man who lost he dog is so frightened of being all alone for the rest of his life that he still wants to join George and Lennie's dream farm even after Lennie kills Curley's wife. Also I think that Curley's wife is one of the loneliest people in the novel. I think the thing she wants the most is a friend and someone to talk to. She's so lonely that she tries too hard to be liked by all the farmhands thus becoming unpleasant to be around. She dislikes her husband and she doesn't know who to turn to. Lennie is the only person who will talk to her. However, it's also Lennie who ends up killing her.  On a side note I think Paul's post was really interesting about self reliance being more of a human concept in our literature.   I think it would be nice to "live on the fatta and lan."  :)
