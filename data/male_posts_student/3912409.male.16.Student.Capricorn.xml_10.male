Center and I ask Wes if he has enough money to register and he says "yeah I brought $20", then he looks in his backpack and it seems that he only brought $6... so I start laughing at him and we left. Then we got to the tennis courts and we both had no water so we biked over to the mall and picked some up. I just got normal sized water bottle...... but Wes...... he had to buy a jug of water..... I laughed at him again and we left. After all that I picked up my package on the other side of the mall that I ordered quite a while, but since it wasn't in stock I had to wait which wasn't fun.    yeah yeah... so eventually I got home and me and my friend went to I, Robot. We met up with some other friends when we got there, and it was a really good movie I give it a thumbs up      After the movie we went over to McDonalds and Miranda (I call her Cookie) bought a happy meal type thing... a grilled cheese and a toy..... and that was quite the dumb toy. Eventually I got home and ate some food and started typing this..............    k, sleeping time now
