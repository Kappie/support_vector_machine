On Saturday, my dad woke me up, and wanted me to go ref my brothers AYSO soccer game. I told him to get the hell out of my room. Then i slept some more. When i awoke, i went out and ran the dog around the block. I felt really gay doing it. Then, when i got back, my brother informed me that Daniel Unger had called me about practicing for evening of the arts. So i called him back. He told me that my brother, Dylan, was probably the weirdest person he had ever talked to on the phone. Then, Chris came and picked me up to take me to Michaels house, and with him, Chris, Daniel, and Anne i practiced the music for Evening of the Arts. After doing that for a while, we went out and threw a frisbee around, nearly taking Anne's head off numerous times. Fun-fun it was. Then i came home and talked to people for hours on the internet, and went to bed. Today my dad went to Atlanta, and my brother is out with his skater-punk friends yo, so I've been alone all day. I guess i've been on the internet all day, taking the occasional break to piss, eat, and take the dog out. I should probably do homework now........essay on fate.......damn you fate......
