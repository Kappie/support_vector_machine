You probably enjoy a good sip of Gatorade now and then, too.    urlLink   Which old school Nickelodeon show are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       Heavy metal!  You rock!  It's mostly about the music instead of lyrics for you...but you channel most of the emotion through the lyrics! Mosh pit for you!  Just be careful you don't give yourself a concussion with so much headbanging...    urlLink   What genre of rock are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      I've been thinking...(a dangerous past time I knowwwww-Beauty and the Beast)  I've made an intelligent decision. I'm not dating anyone for a year unless a majour change is needed. And to be honest I'm happy right now. I've got a core group of close friends, i've got a second tier of friends who are cool.  I'm happy with focusing on studying and chilling wiht these people.  I've adopted a Que Sera, Sera (whatever will be, will be) mentality.   I've got enough stuff going on to entertain me and to divulge me time in, enoughs tudies to drown most people will follow soon (England, you better live up to expectations asshole, cause i need a break)  I'm cool though, I'm pretty happy, i won't deny the fact that everyone once in a while i need to hug someone, but having three Ap classes- having to plan out two summers now, and basically work my ass off cause i don't have no option anymore (which is good, i believe that the best of me is brought out under pressure, and this is like sitting on a hot stove for me right now) should take my mind off of any hormones.   And amazingly, today on FRIDAY JULY THE 2ND AS OF 3:53 P.M. I'd like to say that i'm happy, sleep deprived, and that i'm looking foward to the future.  Don't feel like saying much more than that right now, don't feel ike typing mroe to the point, but i'm gonna post pone my  MY GENERATION: IT'S MUSICAL LEGACY  until Saturday.  So to keep you entertained i'm brining up an old draft i've had kicking around here in the Blogosphere for a while.... CAMERA, LIGHTS ACTIONA  "This special report brought to you by Franco...." **insert wayne's world TUTUTUTUTUTU TUUUUTUTUTU TUUTUTUTUTU in here*** _________________________________________________ Girl Scouts. Myth or Mystic? You rarely hear much about the little girls in the green clothes making works of art with pasta shells anymore. Sure, their the butt of the jokes of many a cartoon. I swear, I haven't seen a cartoon with an episode were Girl Scouts were not involved. However, I have only seen a handful of Girl Scouts in real life.  Most of those sightings were this morning. I was out shopping for some whipped cream and some wasp traps, and in front of the store was this little booth being run by five little girls dressed in normal garb. I didn't think anything of it till I left the store. One of the ten-year old girls pulled me over and asked if I could buy some cookies. Girl Scout cookies! 1+1=2, and Girls+Girl Scout Cookies=Girl Scouts. My eyes were fogging over. Here there were. Actual Girl Scouts. Tears were in my eyes as I went home. After about ten minutes of intense crying, I suddenly relized that I had bought two boxes of Girl Scout Cookies.   .   Yes, I finally had the mysterious Girl Scout Cookies. I have heard many things about them, but I had never had them in my possesion to this day. I've seen all kinds of mixed reviews. Some people think that these discount factory-chrurned discs are pure pieces of crap. Others think the cookies are a balanced part of a healthy breakfest. I just knew I had to open these things right away and find out for myself, but I forced myself a few moments to find my camera.  Are you ready?  You sure?  Becuase, you know, who knows what we'll find.     First up is  Double Dutch , the unholy combination of chocolate cookies and chocolate chips. Sort of a self-defeating concept, don't cha' think? Also, did the Dutch actually invent these cookies? Not exactly a hard concept to concieve, I'm sure children who get their hands on some mixing tools and some flour tried to make their own chocolate cookies with chocolate chips, and probably expected chocolaty heaven.  I probably think that those kids would have made better cookies, though. These things suck.     But first... NUTRITION! Before I dwelled into the field of cookies distributed by little girls, I had to make sure they at least were not too far tracking from my diet plan, which consists of only one rule:   1. Don't eat 10-year old sushi that's been left out in the sun. Everything else is fine.   Based on both the boxes, these cookies contain more ingrediants then a nine-piece dinner at a five-star bed and breakfest, yet contains almost nothing in terms of vitamins and minerals.110 calories, but no Vitamin C. Things are like giant crunchy heart attack disks that don't even taste that great... But I'm getting ahead of myself. By the way, there is not a single date on this box. The only thing to place it within an age range is the fact that the Girl Scout Website is printed on it. I just checked it out, and it states there is 3.8 million Girl Scouts in the U.S.A. and that they've been at it for 90 years. And I've only seen five of them, all of them today. Where are the rest of these millions of Girl Scouts? I smell conspiracy.     Before we get to the cookies themselves, I should mention the list of things the box advertises the different things you'll be helping if you buy a box of Girl Scout Cookies, each with it's own bit of clip art. Here's the lowdown:  1.  Strong Community : A picture of three houses. Big whooping community. 2.  Strong Leadership:  A picture of the Lady Libery's torch. Doesn't that symbolize freedom instead of leadership? Hmm.  3.  Strong Skills:  A computer, which in twenty years will have replaced all of us in jobs. Sort of "Lack of Skills" right?  4.  Strong Friendship:  Thing from the Addams Family clasped to the evil hand from Evil Dead II.  5.  Strong Spirit:  A heart, cause you have to have a heart in order to be alive and actually gave a spirit.  6.  Strong Minds:  An exploding lightbulb. I blew it up with my mind.  7.  Strong Values:  The Girls Scout logo. Cause Girl Scouts are all the values you'll ever need.   Now, for some Double Dutch cookies...     I wasn't going for this effect, but those cookies do look like a string of crap, right? Am I just perverted? But really, they do look like poo. The plastic wrap was a pain to open, and I finally just opted for some sharp objects. If we were to cover Fort Knox in Girl Scout plastic wrap, I'm sure there would be a lot of lay offs for security guards.     They look like poo, but these cookies were as hard as crystal. I had to put all my strength into breaking it in half. Chewing took twenty minutes. My mouth had turned into a literal rock tumbler, crushing only remotly-flavored bits of cookie. This cookie made me hate the Dutch. I refused to even touch the rest of them and buried them next to the rabbit pen. Don't worry, they'll last forever.     In contrast, Samoas cookies are everything Double Dutch isn't: It's extremly soft and full of taste. And there is a girl wearing a fireman's hat. Double Dutch doesn't have that. All they have are airplanes on the box. Firemen are cooler then airplanes. HAHA!     Also, the plastic wrap was easier to open. These cookies are like night n day, baby.     There is one problem, though... The cookie is of 100% coconut. It's all just coconut in different colors. If you don't like coconuts, well, tough luck, sucker. Frankly, I love coconut, so I did not bury these cookies. I didn't eat any more, though, cause it's Cait's birthday, and I wanted to save room for some chocolate pie. The only person I know that chooses pie over cake.  So, in review, be very careful when picking out Girl Scout Cookies. They ain't healthy, and half of them taste like dirt. Tread with caution.  Yeah. I met some Girl Scouts.
