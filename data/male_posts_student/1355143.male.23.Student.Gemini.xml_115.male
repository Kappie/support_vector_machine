Now I know that some of you might find that hard to believe but when you here my timetable I think you might be suitably impressed!  I have to be at work at nine on most days, but the main problem is thatI am still living at home which means that I have to commute into town. Now obviously I am glad to be home and there are certain services (ones that only mothers can provide i.e. cleaning and washing!) that I am glad to have available to me but it does take me about one and a half hours to get to work. Now some of you may be confused as you thought that I lived "just" outside London, well I do but our public transport system is crap so it takes forever!  That means that on an avergae day I get up at quarter to seven to get to work.....  This would not be half as bad if I did not have to work to past eleven in the evening as I have donw twice this week, that means that I can only catch the last train home which gets me to bed just before one in the morning. Now you are all clever people so I will leave you to do the maths but essentially it leaves very little time for sleep and nothing much else! Any remnants of a social life have been relegated to the weekend when I am invariably to tired to indulge myself fully but hey ho, gotta get used to it I guess!  So now I am taking a cheeky few minutes off to post to you all and hope that nobody else is slaving away as hard as I am, then again the weather outside is extremely grim and there are worse places to be than in a nice warm office...  However the beach in Port Olimpic seems a very tempting proposition right now!  Well seeing as work is my life I don't really have much else to say, until next Friday probably, be good all,  A
