You close an eye and when you               reopen it, the holidays are gone! Darn, I was just starting to have fun!  Anyway, I slept at 2+ and woke at 6. Strangely, I didn't feel tired at all during classes. Speaking of classes, today was a real mess. Teachers were going through things so fast, I couldn't understand a thing. Lol, I hope I'm not gonna lag behind.. Escaped from the discipline mistress also this morning.. I was sporting long hair (now cut) and I practically walked past her without even catching her attention. Hehe.. I'm gonna try that again some day..  When I got home, I decided to do a countdown to my O levels as well as after them. TOTAL FREEDOM!!! WOOOO!! okok, lets not get carried away. got exactly 10 weeks to my prelims. After that, everyone's gonna go full speed ahead. I've never been a studying person but this time round, I don't really have a choice.. things are starting to change in me..   Worries - August, there will be a Bboy showcase at Causeway Point down at Woodlands.            I wonder Inertia would do? Training really hard on my flares and headspins now.           And sometimes just play around with airflares.. I hope we put on a good show..           There's FloorSkillz too.. man..
