Life is eventful here, there's something to fret about daily, something to be excited about, something to look forward to, something to prepare for.    Making good presentations is a skill you learn to continuously refine here. I made my first formal presentation to my class today (as part of a group). The course is 'Information Technology for Management' and our topic was 'Computer Hardware: CPU and Memory'. My part was to explain the working of the CPU as you would to a layman, since people from various different backgrounds make up the class. I had good slides and images (latter courtesy some excellent websites :) ) and the presentation was well-received. There were some good queries at the end and I was able to handle them very well. Overall, a positive experience.   What's on the cards for tomorrow? A quiz in Organizational Behaviour (for which about a 100 pages have to be read), a written assignment tobe submitted on behalf of my group for the same subject. Relatively little.
