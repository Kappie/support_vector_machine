If you read my last post I have had a lot of troubles with my dad tonight, and when I tried to cook some sausages my brother got all weird about the sausages and my dad (he had to wake up) and he yelled and yelled and it esculated to an extreme point (I wasn't even saying anything-in fact I prolly only said 2, 3 words). He said stuff like "I have to move out"....which is a good thing because I want to. But anyways...I will prolly say more tommorow....now to finish my sausages....
