Finally, after 15 exams and more stress than a PMSing single mum, I can finally collapse and not care any more. Life is becoming good.  Man, I'm tired. I really should stop talking to people until 3am. And stop with the chocolate - I think it may be keeping me awake.  Now I need to get myself out of these shitty school clothes. Later.  Oobs.
