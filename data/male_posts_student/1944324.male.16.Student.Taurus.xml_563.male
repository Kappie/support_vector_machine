But anyway, we took our dear cousin and her boyfriend up to Chicago for the weekend, and did stuff. We went to the Sears Tower, ate lunch at the Weber Grill, stayed at the Inter-Continental (again) and basically kicked it old school.  Also, in a sports related event (I know, I can hear you scrolling right now) Tim Henman (Awesome British Tennis Player) is on track to possibly win Wimbeldon (the Super Bowl of Tennis). And that would be really cool. But even if he does make it to the finals, he'd probably be beat by Andy Roddick (Awesome American Tennis Player). Okay, I'm done now.  Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!
