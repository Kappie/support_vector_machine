"Dreadfully boring," were my words, I think, which may be unfair.  The first chunk was kind of amusing, a little bit.  I thought the rest of it dragged on, and on, and on... which may just mean I missed something, or I'm not as smart as Roger Ebert.  Back in Boston, by the way, for anyone following closely.  800 words on Harvard's "winter term" and/or the new year coming tomorrow morning if I can summon the inspiration.
