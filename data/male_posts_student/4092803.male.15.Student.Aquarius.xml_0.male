When I was about 7, my mom and her friend would make me go fishing, like, every weekend with them, and, my god, was it boring, I never caught a fish either usually when I went, I've actually caught one or two while fishing, but, they're not as abundant as the media shows.  Imagine, sitting on the shore of a lake (few people usually actually take boats out in the water, unless they're 60 year old men, they all cast from the shore) for about.. 3 whole hours, waiting to catch a fish..  What the fuck is up with that?  I mean, it would just be easier to hike your ass down to the bloody supermarket, which, may I add, is bout 30 minutes closer, and, doesn't smell of chum, and, grab some fish from the freezer aisle.  "But, those fish aren't  fresh. "  Well, I don't know about everyone else, but, witht he 2or 3 small fish we caught, usually, when we got home, my mom's friend skinned and gutted them, cutting himself since he's drunk, cussed in frustration, and, ended up shoving them in the freezer and sending me on my bike to get some Wendys.  Earlier toda,y I decided to dig in my freezer, find the fish, and, check the dates that were put on the package with a magic marker.  Now, I found one fish, that I could grab without being smushed by tons of other frozen indescrenable meats.  Now, what did it say?  "Bluegill, July,  1996 "  I have an eight year old frozen fish in my freezer.. And.. now, that's fresh!  Seriously, get fish from the supermarket.  Now.. actually fishing.. it's nothing than sitting on some hard uncomfortable rocks, or, in some itchy bug filled grass, with a fishing pole out in the water, staring a small red orb, waiting for it to move, so, you know you have a damn fish.  Where the bloody hell is the fun in that?  Now, I've developed my own theory, for, why people like going fishing.      The three reasons people want to go fishing:   1)To get piss drunk 2)Because they're too poor to buy food, becuase, they spend all their money on getting piss drunk. 3)It's actually and excuse for guys to get out of the house and have homoerotic orgies without their wives knowing, all while they're piss drunk.      So, yeah.  So, basically don't go fishing unless you want to get alot of bug bites, be bored out of your bloody mind, and, be assraped by your buddy Jim.  Trust me, he didn't bring that lube to make the hook go easier into the fishe's mouth  But, something else is prolly gonna end up in somebody elses mouth  Jesus, I've made at least three references to anal sex of some sort since my blog started, just only yesterday.
