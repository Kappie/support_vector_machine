Marty is back in and he is coming over to write stuff with me tomorrow, I am also working on a purevolume site.  We found out Brandon's trombone has a warranty, so when we do shows we can do crazy shit with it at the end, smash it, throw it, light it on fire...and he can get it repaired/replaced for free...ah, dont you love loopholes?  I'm at my dad's, i havent been there in awhile I missed Bo and Milly.  Milly ran off today but we found her a couple hours ago, she was out in the neighbors yard meowing, we think she might have picked a fight with the neighbor's cat.  Sunday we are working on a history video, and with Nick's sweet editing it will be really tight.
