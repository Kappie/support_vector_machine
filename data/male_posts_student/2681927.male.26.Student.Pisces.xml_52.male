But I did watch when the Russian kepper were sent off and it seems to me that the referee took the wrong decision. At the same time, I had the opportunity to watch some replays of that situation and decide which Terje Hauge couldn't do. But anyway, the referee have to be perfectly sure that when he shows the red card it is deserved. If he or she isn't, they shouldn't send them off.   So the key issue here is whether or not Hauge were in the right position to make a correct decision, and I'm not too sure about that.    urlLink Greece - Spain    1 - 1   urlLink Russia - Portugal 0 - 2
