Since I didn't have anything else to do, I went with the younger scouts as the did an orientering cource for a requriement. When we ran into somebody's house, we knew something had to be wrong. Sure enough, the younger scouts had gotten us lost (it wasn't my fault, because I was just following them). One of the leaders found us a little after that, and lead us back to the pavilion. On the way, he said he was proud of us for all sticking together (we started out as three or so seperate groups, and all got mashed together, most likely by the groups behind trying to cheat off of the groups that were ahead). It rained really hard on the way back. I blame our luck on my walking stick, which I took home with me and intend to take to summer camp for more good luck :). (this blog should have emoticons!) Friday: I went to Kennywood (amusement park) with some of my friends for my school's Kennywood picnic. (more of my ex-school, because I'll be going to a Catholic high school next year). The only semi-interesting thing to say is that we got to see them add a new car to one of the roller coasters.  They moved the track to put it on, which was pretty cool.  A ride broke down when I was there for a school field trip (on June 1). In the long line (probably the longest in the park), I said to the friends I was with "It'll probably break down when we get to the end of the line", and sure enough, we had to wait an extra twenty minnutes for them to fix before we could get on (they actualy strapped us into our car, and then it broke). Saturday: My grandparents came over for Father's Day, because my dad wanted to see a concert downtown on the actual day (see below). Knowing grandparents, they just sat around and talked. We did, however, have tasty pie after dinner. (Now, I wish that there was a "yum" emoticon, or at least a happy emoticon) Sunday: We went downdown to see a free, outdoors Richard Thompson concert, some singer my dad likes.  I just sat around and played my gameboy.  At least I got to have a sausage sandwitch for dinner. Monday: I updated my blog.  This is what I put in it. "I've been grounded from the computer, so..." just kidding :)
