I've used the phrase "given that" so often lately, given that it's useful in supporting points.  I bought the soundtrack to Kill Bill today because my guy and I were at the Fnac (roughly equivalent to Borders plus Best Buy) and I was looking for this Phantom Planet album but they didn't have it and I wanted to get something and I liked the music from Kill Bill.  It was pretty good.    All I have left is one ten-minute (two-page) essay about the treaties after WWI, some Macbeth stuff that I don't really have to do, a buttload of math, and impossible chemistry (I don't have the textbook).  It's strange how my history class hasn't started WWI or the Russian Revolution yet but I have to have done a bunch of stuff with both of them.  What to end with...  how about nothing.  Oh yeah, next week should be the one hundredth Strong Bad E-mail, did anyone else notice that?  Ah, I miss TV.
