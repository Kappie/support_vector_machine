I looooove how much drill we already have down. I looooove that we just might have a full trumpet section (just maybe?) there. Rookies get their first taste of tour food. I remember last year's Memorial camp so well that it does not seem like it could have ever been an entire year ago. That's when we started to build up our momentum for the season and those (counts on fingers) FOUR days really did set the tone for the rest of the year. (or rather the following SEVEN weeks of the season that we had left....) Here's something to chew on: As of this Sunday, we have, count 'em, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, TEN weeks left until the 2004 season is over. Ten weeks until Finals. Ten weeks until we don't see each other again for another few months. Ten weeks until my summer really ends.   So let's get this show on the road! Remind everone you see at rehearsal that this is the beginning of something big, and while the season has yet to officially start, our time is already running out.
