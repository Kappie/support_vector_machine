I didn't think Pogo would be worth the $30 a year, but I'm telling you it definitely is.  There is a free trial available for those who want to give it a try.    The premium games are ad free.  They are also of great quality.  Pogo is always adding new games both to the free and premium services.    Take a look at  urlLink Pogo.com
