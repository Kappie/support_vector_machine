Yesterday, Governor Rendell vetoed a bill, which would have provided the necessary funding for schools, citing that it was “unconstitutional” to remove school funding from the general budget process.    It seems to me that the governor is trying to blackmail the state Republicans into giving him his slot machines.  The GOP ought to give into the Governor on this.  The slots would be good for our state, bringing in much needed revenue that is currently being made only by states who allow such gambling.    I don’t think the Republicans are going to give in so easily though.  They’re going to try to paint Rendell as a greedy man who would forfeit the education of his youngest constituents in a political ploy to win his slot machines.    It doesn’t really make sense why the Republicans detest the slot machine plan with such a passion anyway.  People who are going to gamble are going to do so whether Pennsylvania has slot machines or not.  They will simply go to New Jersey or any other state that allows slot machines.  Why shouldn’t Pennsylvania cash in on these people’s gambling habits?
