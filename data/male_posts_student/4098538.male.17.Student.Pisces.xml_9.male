I met Laura first in town and we went to Music Zone 'cause she is in love with someone who works there basically. Then we met up with Ruth and Sean and some other random people. I left them and went into the pub andmet up withsome more friends. A girl called Jo who is a friend of an ex (Debbie), another random girl called Jo who I always see at gigs, and Jo's friend Hannah. I also saw a girl from my college who I said hi to, so I have met a few people from my college this past weekend...! Then we queued up and Chris soon arrived with his many bottles of alcohol (well Malibu and Red Square really) so we finished them off with the help of everyone around me... then we went in. John Loughlin of Raging Speedhorn/Murder 1 was in the toilet and told me I had an amazing t-shirt on (which I did)! Murder 1 were playing first, and they were hella-heavy! Throughout the first two bands I just walked around seeing if anyone I knew was there. I went to the front and met Jo and a Jessicka look-a-like, and got me a free beer out of them! Then My Ruin come on, and wow. They played for a good hour or so in the shittest venue I have ever seen. After the show we went round the back and met a few members, including Tairrie B! Then we were fucked as to how we were getting home, we decided a train was best. So we went to the train station, missed the only train in hours (again) so I didn't get home until 5.00am! Also got stopped and searched by the police at the airport just for wearing a hood... all worth it though...
