New carpeting at 2 PM. Electrician at 8 AM Wednesday August 4th - Dentist appointment at 4 PM. Boris coming at 2 PM [...] Friday August 6th - Weekly horror movie night Saturday August 7th - Possible party invite [...] Monday August 9th - Dentist appointment at 3:30  And thats it for that... Lots and lots of action. But just all of a sudden that fades away... Lets talk about the carpeting first. That day that said it was coming, apparently it didnt. Im not sure why. My mother had called, and the carpeting finally came the next day. Currently my carpeting is an industrial carpet thats Black and Charcoal colors. I adore it :):)...  The dentist appointment i had gone to on the 9th was fine. I had gone with my Aunt which was only about 3 blocks away at Gerard Towers and i went to see Dr. Landau. It was okay... The synopsis for my one cavity was basically that i needed to get a root canal. That specific day, i was to be treated for it. As i was sitting on the chair, i asked Dr. Landau if it was possible that i could just get the tooth done by laser rather than having to get a needle and drilled. I knew about the lasering due to the fact that my aunt had gotten her tooth lasered once. Basically its where they take this hydro powered tool that basically cuts through the tooth pain free. He wasnt sure though whether or not it would go well due to the fact that the cavity's hole was pretty large, but he went with it.  As i was sitting in the chair for that full hour, finally it was done. It was a very tiring process and i didnt mind it. It didnt hurt at all except for a couple of points. The pain was bareable, but uncomfortable. At the point where the hydro powered tool wore away my enamel and all the way down to the root, the root was exposed to the cold air, giving me that weird feeling like when you open your mouth and cold air comes in and giving u a weird pain tingle into ur tooth. I felt that about 3 times, but it was bareable.  The only part i didnt feel comfortable with was that my mouth was OPEN for a full hour without being closed. The suction tool made my mouth completely dry. There was also a part where this type of gluey substance was put onto my tooth and got onto my tongue and it had tasted sour and bitter. Dr. Landau said it would.  Finally towards the end, the filling was instered in the two holes on my tooth and then dried with this other tool. Finally, i took a gander at the tooth and it was perfect :). In the future, i hope to get a full mouth whitening.  He had said my teeth were perfectly healthy and perfectly aligned. The only other thing is that i have another appointment, because on my right side under a molar, there is a stuck piece of baby tooth that needs to come out. Some how its been stuck there for a long time. Supposedly its a 2 minute process, but it involves the needle. I dont care, ill just take it.  Hm... what else has been going on. Nothing way too big. On and off ive been going out with my cousin and sister to just places... Like getting italian ices once in awhile and just going to the store or walking my dog. Basically thats all thats happened lately. For some reason time has been flying so fast during the days that im not doing anything productive. Usually i sit here coding or doing something useful like reading, but apparently its as if im standing around and sitting for hours at a time not noticing wat the hells going on and how the times going by so fast. Either i should wake up earlier or just stop dicking around and do something productive.  Last but not least there was an incident that occured about 15 minutes ago that got me extremely angry, but after typing here for a bit, the anger subsided... I just dont wanna talk about it, so ill leave it be.  Anything else i should add...hm... Im bored. Befriend me :(....
