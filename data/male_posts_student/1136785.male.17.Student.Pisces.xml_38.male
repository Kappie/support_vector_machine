The professor wants us to study and do honework for six hours a day outside of class. We have weekly they exams, along with a midterm and a final. The weekly exams are two hours in length and I have one tomorrow. Sweet ass.   On the true plus side, I have sort of an excuse for never leaving my room, as I simply do not have the time. I only leave to eat or to go to class - all other times I'm either reading or studying in my room. I've made friends, but I only typically see them when eating.  But the people here are cool. The people in my class are too, but either they're over twenty or they don't live on campus - often both. I've gone around town, and it's ok. Maybe I'll have time to actually do shit on weekends, though it looks like I'm skipping the friday movie trip so I'll finally have time to unpack. An exciting friday night indeed. It's not so bad though. I'm getting alot of reading done, though I should probaby put it aside for more study time. The pace in class never lets up, and we won't be allowed to use english beyond the second week.  For some reason I'm been must jovially mift, which I don't really get. I just need to stop bothering people probably. This is a good time to end my annyoing habit of "Wow, you paid some small amount of attention to me so let me return the favor in a claustrophobia inducing frenzy TEN FOLD" I also should go to the gym, while I'm making a list of shit I'll never do. Thats the one thing I appreciate about the workload - an actual reason why I don't have time to work out, though I do have time to post here apparently.   I need to learn the harmonica - that'd be cool. Wow, I'm incredibly uninteresting. I'm going to say I was trying to be like George Orwell in  Animal Farm  and that I was writing in a deliberately simplistic and infantile style to emphasize the exciting monotony and the child like state you feel when learning an entirely new language. I must a genius of the highest caliber. Wait, I'm lying. I AM a genius of the highest caliber. Hah, silly me.   I don't have the time to waste with much more, though I'll probably still won't study. I'd thought I'd leave you with this  urlLink report , which is fitting for June 3rd. Tomorrow will be the fifteenth anniversay of the Tianamen Square Massacre in Beijing, where goverment troops opened fire on students protestors advocating democratic reforms, among other things. Today, the political opposition is al and fragmented. No one cares as long as the economy continues churning along at its unprecedented growth rate. Marx was right - who cares about the plight of the workers when instant gratification abounds. Its funny to see the world's largest communist nation bribe its population with loosening economic controls while ever tightening political ones (along with the irony that coorporations have found one the best places to exploit workers is the largest communist nation on earth). Of course that leaves a fairly large majority of the population on the outside - the rural farmers and countryside dwellers from whom Mao himself declared to b the true heart of the Revolution - in leiu of city dwellers. As we've seen in India, ignoring the rural poor can lead to no small amount of trouble. And in China, they can't vote and they only have one past precedent of making their voice heard.   Here are some other things to pass the time with:   urlLink A look at the situation in Saudi Arabi    A interesting  urlLink report  on what would be the best ways to spend additional resources helping developing countries. (I'll give you a hint, 'Kyoto' made the bottom of the list.)  A  urlLink detailed look  at the recent Libertarian Party Convention, for those interested.  A tory leader in Canada  urlLink paints the picture  of a truly conservative economic plan. And try and tell me that it ain't purty.    Emma's Good News Journal    - The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society released a  urlLink report  that finds “overall observed cancer incidence rates dropped 0.5 percent per year from 1991 to 2001, while death rates from all cancers combined dropped 1.1 percent per year from 1993 to 2001.”   Thats all for today. I guess I did have the time to waste on some of this.
