I'll explain: I just figured out that I am destined to be a clown or sumthing because a few simple things 1.) I always feel a duty to cheer people up 2.) I LOVE to make people laugh 3.) You either think I'm funnier that hell....or you hate me as you can see, all of there are clown traits.  But, now that I think about it, I just feel a sense of duty.  period.  end of sentence. For instance: I was just walking up to the bathroom a bit ago, and I felt the need to take a shower, and I know a bunch of people who would've just gone and takin' a shower, but I didn't, because of the mere fact that I'm talking to Conrad online, and I feel it is my duty to keep talking to him as long he wants me to, I'm not just gonna say I'll be right back, then go take a shower and return half an hour later just to see that he is no longer online...when I say I'll be right back, I mean it.  Do I bend over to other peoples will too easily?!?!?!  I don't know....I'll have to think about this when I actually do take a shower.  Or are sum people way too easily sidetracked....I dunno anymore, I can't think straight right now....which is probably why I never wrote my sonet for Creative Writing..I LUV poetry, yet I didn't write one...what is up with me?!?!?!  Man, last night I went and saw Hidalgo with my dad, and I've gotta tell you....THAT MOVIE ROXORZ ALL THE BASE THAT ARE BELONG TO US!!!!  Seriously....it rocked.  Then when we got home I went to tre's LAN for a little bit....with a few amusing incidents along the way.   1st incident- I put the car into first gear and took my foot off the clutch while the car wasn't moving, if you drive a manual, you know this is a no-no....it kills the car instantly, leaving the driver quite confused and looking stupid.  Just as this happened my dad looked back just to see me drive away, instead he saw me with a dead car.  2nd incident- I sat there for like 30 seconds just putting on my seatbelt, meanwhile my dad just kept staring at me, and then when I finally got on my seat belt, I turned on the car and didn't give it enough gas and killed it again..in the exact same spot....well...now I feel like a total dipshit 3rd incident- I finally got off to the LAN and arrived with no more problems.  Then when I get there I saw what I could've sworn was two people being rather intamite upstairs...and to my surprise..they kind've were....and then I rang the doorbell and ruined the whole moment.  They came and opened the door and I took off my shoes and went downstairs. That's the end of the incidents...but...I only stayed at the LAN for like 15 minutes....just long enough to recieve an attempted tickling for Kyle, get raped by Ervin, and use my 1337 ninja skillz to sneak into the bathroom area and sneak back out without waking any sleeping Eklunds.  I then glided back downstairs and waited to play DDR for like 10 minutes, but Ervin and Brittany are selfish whores*I'm just kidding* then I ended up leaving and returning to my home, where I slept peacefully...and had no dreams that I can remember....and so is my life....which is calling me....gotta answer!  Peace!  Spense
