Today I watched "Gu Zhon" players work their magic. I was entirely mesmerized by the fluidity of the music. Their hands and fingers, they were like smooth brease. Like a zephyr. The effort was seemingly fastidious yet, at the same time, calm. It's all juxtaposition.  I'm going to finish Guitar, move on to bass, finalise precussion, Take on the piano by the time I'm 20. Then, I'll move on to the Gu Zhong. My my... would you look at that. Dripping with nieveity.  I'm in a game of survivor. Prize money is $60K. Enough to educate the children of 20 Ethiopian villages. Not my will, but God's be done.  There's alot on my mind now. It's quite chaotic in there. Lord, grant me the wisdom to know the difference. For you who reads this, sieze the day. Tell someone you love them. Not appreciate them, or are thankful for them, but that you love them.  Goodnight.  H2l
