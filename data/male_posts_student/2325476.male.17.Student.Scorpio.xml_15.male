Then theres the whole list of explicitaves that people take offense to, Shit, Bitch, Fuck, etc.  Words represent ideas. They aren't constants, they dont have a mass, they aren't tangible. They are variables in the most algebriac form of the word. They can't be seen, you cant hold one, they are a manifestation of an idea, designed in such a way as to relate that idea to someone else. That being said, i'd like to point out that there are many things people should take offense to. If someone runs over your mailbox, you should take offense. If someone hits you, you should take offense. But it is PITIFUL, allow me to repeat myself, PITIFUL, to take offense to someone's ideas. "Oh my god! You had a thought, something that is in its nature completely uncontrolable, and often times a product of your upbringing, and i dont like it! In fact, I'm hurt!" I heard someone say that they were offended to hear someone call another person a retard because they had a relative with a mental disability. WHAT THE FUCK?! Someone is an egomaniac. Look, you're not special, we didn't even know you had a mentally disabled relative, and we're not slighting them, because they are the LAST thing on our minds when we call someone a retard! Ok, so what's my point? People who take offense to ideas are fucking retarded homos.
