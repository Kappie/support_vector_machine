Professor Siva was sitting at his table, propping his head up, tapping his fingers, looking extremely bored.  	 Cheryl entered the classroom and looked round, trying to find her friends (as this was a combined class with the Ravingclaws, this was understandably difficult). She noticed Professor Siva was staring at her. Looking round, she realized that everyone else was already seated. Quickly, she took a seat beside Eunice, cringing at the embarrassment of the situation. 	 “Now that we are all  settled down ,” Professor Siva began in a pointed voice, “I will begin my lesson. As you all know, you all will be taking your O.W.Ls this year, and your O.W.L results are extremely important as they may determine your future in the magical world. While Defense Against the Dark Arts may appear to be an irrelevant subject, I should hope all of you do well. And I may add, if I do stay on at Hogwarts, I will only take on the best students in my N.E.W.T classes.” 	 “As if anyone would want to take N.E.W.T classes with a teacher like him,” Cheryl heard Jeremy Khong, a Ravingclaw, whisper behind her. She stifled a giggle. 	 “Oh, it’s very funny is it?” Professor Siva directed his glare at Cheryl. “Would you like to share the joke with the class?”  	 Cheryl hurriedly shook her head, while silently cursing and swearing at her teacher.  	 “This year we will be concentrating on spells – jinxes, hexes and the spells that counter them. Though I commonly take a practical approach to my classes, for today reading will suffice. Take out your copy of  Jinxes for the Jinxed and Hexes for the Helpless , everyone, and turn to page 3. Begin reading. There will be no need to talk.” 	 The class put away their wands disappointedly, and took out their extraordinarily thick textbooks.  	 Cheryl turned to page 3 and began to read.  The Difference Between Jinxes and Hexes , the title read, in large, bold font. The words after that, however, were the size of words in the newspapers.  Jinxes and Hexes differ in many ways, but the basic difference between them is in their effects ... 	 Cheryl had no sooner reached the second paragraph when she felt a sudden wave of drowsiness come over her, drawing her in its warm blanket. Her eyes were feeling very heavy... 	 “Cheryl!” A voice called suddenly. Cheryl sat up bolt upright, to find Professor Siva staring directly at her. “What is the difference between jinxes and hexes?” 	 “Er...” Cheryl paused. She didn’t know. She chanced a glance at her book, but no sooner had she looked down than when, with a flick of his wand, Professor Siva Summoned the book to him. He slammed it shut, and returned to glaring at Cheryl. 	 “Er...” Cheryl said again. She could hear Jeremy hissing behind her, “ In the effects ...”  	 “Five points from Griffindoor for sleeping in class,” Professor Siva said shortly. “And another five from Ravingclaw for trying to help a student in the wrong,” he added.  	 The rest of the lesson went on without incident. At the end of it all Professor Siva had given them an essay to do, another two feet on the differences between jinxes and hexes, to be handed in the next lesson, which, unfortunately, happened to be Wednesday. Furthermore, he had also confiscated Cheryl’s book, saying he would only return it next lesson. 	 Cheryl was quietly fuming. It was a really crummy day. She had lost ten points for Griffindoor, got into the bad books of Professors Molekiw and Siva on their first day and now had to do an essay without her textbook. Minyu, sensing her anger, placed one arm on Cheryl’s shoulder. “Cheer up,” she said gently. 	 Cheryl returned the gesture with a small smile.  	 “He’s an idiot, that one is,” Jeremy said contemptuously from behind them, as they walked to their next class. “I should be  getting  five points for helping someone!”  	 They laughed. The girl beside Jeremy, called Wan Qing, said to Cheryl, “Oh my goodness... he was so mean to you... what’s his problem?!”  	 Cheryl shrugged. She didn’t care anymore.  	 “Ah, well... bye then,” Wan Qing said, as the Ravingclaws turned left to go to their next class. “See you at practice!” she called out to Muthu, Matt and Eunice, the three Drama Society members. The Griffindoors waved, before going on down the corridor to their Divination classroom. 	 The windows of the classroom were covered with translucent blue curtains, giving the room an odd blue shine. In a corner there was a pot of herbs bubbling – the smell was thick, and, to say the least, rather disgusting. Cheryl shuddered when the smell entered her nostrils. Though she liked Divination as a subject, the atmosphere wasn’t exactly to her liking. She could see that the guys were taking the smell worse than she was – Muthu and Matt were pinching their noses and closing their eyes in horror. 	 “Good morning, my dears,” a misty voice came out of the corner of the room. “How nice it is to see all of you again. My Inner Eye has informed me that all of you are safe and sound – how glad I am to know that.” Their teacher rose from the armchair she was sitting in, and stood facing the class. 	 Professor Kailini did not exactly have very good fashion sense – she was covered in gauzy scarves and shawls, the colours of which often clashed. Cheryl winced when she saw the red of her teacher’s dress accompanied by the bright yellow of a thick woolen coat.  	 “We are supposed to start on astrology this year,” Professor Kailini said softly, in her deliberately misty voice. “However, my Inner Eye has informed me that you all will be particularly adept at this subject.” 	 Cheryl beamed. She, Eunice and Minyu were perhaps the biggest fans of horoscopes and planetary Divination in Griffindoor. 	 “As such I find that there is no need to commence lessons today. All of you may do whatever you wish – though I pray you will not make too much noise. My Inner Eye needs some repose from the noise and bustle of the school.” 	 She withdrew into a chamber and shut the door, leaving the Griffindoors rather surprised.  	 Muthu broke the silence by giving a perfect imitation of Professor Kailini’s voice, which led to a  lot  of laughter. He then whipped out a packet of Exploding Snap cards and turned to the rest with a gleam in his eye. “Cards, anyone?” he called out.  	 Nearly the whole class flocked to him, clamouring for a turn to play. Cheryl, while jostling for a place, saw Matt bent over a piece of parchment, scribbling. He had already written over an inch in his neat handwriting. In front of him his copy of  Interactive Potions  was wide open, turned to the page on aardvark bile.  	 He sensed someone looking at him and glanced up. For a moment he met Cheryl’s eyes, and smiled. “The master copy,” he said pleasantly. 	 Cheryl grinned back. She turned round, back to her card game. 	 At that precise moment the pack of cards exploded.  ----------  “Your hair looks very good, Cheryl,” Professor Helmi remarked an hour later in the Griffindoors’ Arithmancy class.  	 Cheryl forced a smile on her face. She had been trying to somehow mend her frayed hair after the incident with the cards, but only succeeded in making it look fractionally less burnt.  	 ----------  “Well, you can’t say it wasn’t an interesting first day back,” Muthu said in the Griffindoor common room later. The whole bunch of fifth-years had been lamenting about how terrible their first day back at school was. Cheryl especially had taken a big part in abusing their new teachers.  	 “We already have five assignments!” Hu Ping said shrilly.  	 “One foot for Kiw, two for Siva, two exercises for Helmi and another essay for Mr. Teo. Ain’t that lovely?” Matt chimed in from a corner, grinning. He was now deep into his Charms essay.  	 “Can you stop being so irritating and stop doing your assignments?” Barnabas said. 	 Matt shook his head. “I can’t stand undone assignments,” he said simply. He then held up two pieces of parchment. “Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts, anyone?”  	 They were snatched away from him immediately.  	 “I think we’re all going to die this year,” Muthu dead-panned. “It’s O.W.L year!” 	 “Well, just study hard and you’ll do okay, won’t you,” Matt replied vaguely, as he flicked through his copy of  Charms for the Charmed . 	 “How can we find any time to study with all this homework?” Cheryl retorted.  	 “Just don’t do it then,” Yi Fan said jokingly.  	 The rest gave him patronizing looks. Yi Fan rarely did any homework.  	 Two hours later, the common room was slowly emptying as students went off to their dormitories. Cheryl yawned and put down her quill. At least she had finished her essay on jinxes and hexes. The rest could be dealt with later, she thought, as she walked up slowly to her dormitory. She hoped for the best.
