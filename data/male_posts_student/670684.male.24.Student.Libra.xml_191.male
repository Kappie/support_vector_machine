I passed on a chance to go see the lunar eclipse out at the LBJ state park near Johnson City tonight.  It's a beautiful night, two good friends were headed there, and I threw up the deuce, even after taking a three hour nap this afternoon spurred by good but early golf and poor sleep quality last night.  I stayed here because I didn't want to waste time, yet I am wasting time here...I was before writing on the blog.  The blog is not a waste of time.    The screenplay that got me into UT Screenwriting included a great composite character based on two friends.  One of the friends constantly asks me to turn this character into a full-length screenplay.  I don't write romantic comedy, and this is what he wants, even though his ending is anything but commonplace.  Yet I feel compelled to give this a go...much maligned from his suggestions, but every good adaptation is unique to itself.    At a party a few nights ago, a girl asked me and another screenwriter about our feelings regarding the artist as a businessman; can someone who makes a living from art truly be an artist?  I said I hoped so, and while I understood her position that money jepordaises creative content, the ability to live when not producing art is what the artist needs rather than making money when not working.  Denton had a similar answer, but the tone was different; he knew he could and he knew he would.  "You can't let doubt enter in," he said, "or you'll never make it.  I know I'm going to make it.  I have to know."    I don't know.
