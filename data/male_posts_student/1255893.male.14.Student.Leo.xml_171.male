Not too bad I guess. Might as well do my best while I stay in the program. I have an IUE a week from Friday. We havn't even finished going through the unit yet .... but I guess they can't penalise US for that, can they?   I havn't gone out socially for about a month. Not kewl. Now Im bein invited to the movies on Saturday w/ Roy, Coco, and Kelley, (maybe Aaron), and I have no idea who else. It'd be so great if I could go, but Ima either be stuck @ home workin or goin to the library to do research for one of my Marine Bio projects w/ Alex.   Ave's comin back soon :) I jus keep thinkin to myself .. . . the sooner I finish my major school shizzle ..... the sooner I get to see her. You know what? It's been working! Ive been turning in all my stuff on time ....... even if i DO lose my regular amounts  of sleep. well ..... we gots 3 months or so of school left. I can grin an bare this crud for jus a widdle bit more. Woah.... 3 months... seems like jus last week I was @ orientation. How time flies....
