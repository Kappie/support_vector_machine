Well I figured that if I wrote down al the things that happened to us we cuold make a whole movie out of it so I'm just going to give a few Highlights..  The number one highlight was seeing willie a bunch of times in 2 days..  He would come out with almost every band and he did a whole blues set himself in the middle of the second day. it was all amazing and if I ever get a tat  i am going to get wilie's autograph on my body over my heart..  It would signify a love that is hard to compete with no matter how much sex we have...  but the first day all we did was get drunk and listen to music.. it was amazing..   It reaffirmed my love for music..  the second day we didn't really drink very much but we stil just chilled and listened to tunes..  we met all kinds of wacky people and had everyone who met us act like they had known us forever..  all this experience did was reaffirm my love for texas..    I was goig to end with a quote about Texas (A state that I love) but I found this and it is so me it's scary..  so here it is..  "Anyone who is considered funny will tell you, sometimes without even your asking, that deep inside they are very serious, neurotic, introspective people." - Wendy Wasserstein
