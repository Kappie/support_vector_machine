We pretty much won all the games even though they didn't keep score.  During the last game against the Freshmen, I caught a nasty elbow close to my temple right against the bone closest to the eye.  It felt like someone hit me with a bat on my head.  I was shook up but I'm alright.  Really all that happened was I got a headache and my eyes teared up.  I was really glad when that was over because I really don't like basketball on Saturday mornings.  Anyways after that, we had to lift at Kennedy.  That was dumb, I don't know why we did that, but oh well I got that done really quick.  I was happy when that was done.  After that I just sat around for a long time.  I took a nice long nap.. about 3 hours.  It was real nice.  I woke up around 5:30 and got ready to do the thing at Kennedy for the Jr. Cougar tournament.  I did the clock twice for the games.  Andy Sabin and I did that 7 and 8 o'clock.  It was pretty easy but boring.  Oh well, after that I sat around like normal and did not much of anything.  I actually played Madden 2002 for my computer for awhile.  I was the Dolphins and I played against the Browns.  I wish I had a controller for my computer because using the keyboard sucks.  Anyways I got the updated 2003 rosters so I had Rikky Williams and everyone on the Dolphins.  I ened up with 5 touchdowns with Williams and around 240 yards.  It was crazy how easy you can get an average of 10 yards per carry.  The game's almost not even fun.  Since that I've just been sitting here playing pool on Yahoo with Whitney.  She kicks my butt every once in awhile and I do pretty good every now and then as well.  That's always fun :-)  Anyways that's pretty much it for today.  Night.
