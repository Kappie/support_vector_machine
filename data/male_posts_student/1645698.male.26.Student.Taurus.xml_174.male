No not the language of black people. If you think I am being racist, try searchin blackspeak on  urlLink google . All you get are sites about ebonics. Anyway, Blackspeak is the language of orcs. Anyway, I found something else that cracked me up. Remember the  urlLink Fanta  (by the way, its from the  urlLink Netherlands , at least I think so. I couldn't find the english version of the site), well... There is an  urlLink Indian  version, called  urlLink Maxala . I saw the commercial today on  urlLink Zee-TV  (the hindi channel). It was so stupid, even worse than the Fanta ones.  The were a couple of guys bowling, and all of a sudden, these chicks came out of nowhere! WTF??!!  Peace out...
