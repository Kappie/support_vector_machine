As i was walking along Bank Street, a seagull came blazing out of the sky and swooped at a pigeon, slamming it on the ground. The pigeon was dead. The Seagull started ripping the poor bird apart and dining on its guts. It was a disturbing sight, there were people standing around gawping at this in shock but nobody would do anything about it - what could one do about it ? I honestly could not believe my eyes...i walked on and as i passed an elderly gentlemen who had witnessed the sight i heard him say "c'est la vie"...
