Oh, and I managed to survive yesterday's music exchange at Chua Chu Kang Secondary School. I actually did not screw up my solo. I was so nervous that I actually skipped lunch just to practice the solo to convince myself that I could do it.      It went off without a glitch and here I am for once actually being proud of myself. Oh, and the other school there were Anderson, Bedok North, Regent and of course Chua Chu Kang. All secondary schools of course.      Right now, there is another big thing coming up and it's Renaissance. I will have to play my solo for two nights in a row and pray that nothing goes wrong.      Yesterday night, I cancelled the Legion outing for Our Lady Ark of the Covenant(AOC) Praesidium that's supposed to occur today as there were too few people going. It will be resheduled at a later date.      Well, that's all I've got to say and I hope I can say more the next time. See you all soon!
