I started out with a messed up mouth with crowding and crookedness, but ~20 months, 15 broken brackets, 8 broken bands, 4 bend and/or broken arch-wires, and 4 round trip plane tickets later, my teeth are finally fixed. Hoorah!  As you can tell, I'm totally psyched about this trip. I mean, the braces, walking around my true home-city, seeing my old friends at MIT. It'll all be so nice. Sigh. I'm sure of... almost. I'll also get to see the fireworks out there, which are really amazing. They seem to get better and better every year. It's good stuff. If you ever get a chance, go to Boston for the 4th of July and camp out on the Cambridge side of the Charles River on Memorial Drive right around Kendall Square in MIT. It's good stuff.  Anyway, I'm really excited and might not post for a few days due to lack of connection, but I doubt that because I have an old Tangerine iMac (Rev A (can you believe it?)) that's more than plenty to write a post and surf the net and check my mail and whatnot. Worse comes to worst though, I can always do an audiopost and practice using my higher speaking voice. I REALLY don't like how low it is. It's... boring.  I'd try and make some kinda joke or something to make you feel a little better about spending your time to read this post, but I can't think of anything funny. Sorry :-P.  That is all. -- Feanor  * July 2nd at 14:20
