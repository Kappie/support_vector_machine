Musical songs was getting tedious. I want admin powers.  If you give me admin powers, I will give you chocolate.  if you don't, I will kill this innocent little llama.  The choice is yours. There is now one major male part in the musical left to assign, and three guys left without parts.  The other two are both dancers who can't act (or, in Micheal's[not you!] case, sing).  Which means, most likely, Chad will get two parts.  Barring that, I probably have it, but I really wish she'd announce it soon.   I have decided not to do choir next year.  I'm probably going to take LNTV instead. Good luck tonight to Marten and Erin.  Nothing else to say. The vegetable must be destroyed!  Cast it into the garden in which it was grown!
