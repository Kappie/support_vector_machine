Being honest is all good, but sometimes too honest might can cost you pain and suffering. At work I'm known for the straightest and honest person. If I have something to say to someone, I'll say it. My thing is... if it's right, it's right; if it's wrong, it's wrong. Even if my mom owns the restaurant, people still comes to me with their problems. It's not that they are seeking an easy way out between the conflicts of the boss and them, but rather I don't fall in favorite of neither side. I make my judgments based on fairness.   Sometimes take the time out to go out with co-workers are also good. You'll be surprised they are more relax off the work ground and are able to chit-chat a little more about their personal problems. Simply you can get know them more than you can at work.   Do I like my job? No, I really don't. But is it a very good experience both personally and socially? Yes, this is something I won't get from anywhere else. I"m almost hitting my one year mark working at my mom's restaurant, and it's time for a change...
