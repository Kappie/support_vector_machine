And I will be there because I am forced to attend school by our wonderful South Carolinian government (which on a local level consists of several old, old men who are on the brink of death yet rendered with the responsibility of managing our everyday lives - democracy owns us.)  So anyways. Today, I prepared for my first day of school by purchasing some very crucial items from Staples such as binders, folders, and paper. Then, I have the fortune of bumping into my Spanish teacher while in one of the aisles, and you know, the usual conversation about going back to school begins and ends and we both say good-bye and part ways to hunt down various school supplies. Well, guess who I bump into while in the check-out line? Nothing like seeing the same person twice within a 10 minute time frame. Having already squandered the usual polite conversation, we're stuck feeling really awkward and looking around trying to ignore each other's presence while the old guy ahead (probably a member of the city council) has trouble with one of his purchases. Finally, though, as if someone felt pity for me, we're all spared further embarassment when a new check-out line opens.  Moral of the story: Old people suck.
