When I pretend i can forget about the criminal I am. Stealing second after second just 'cus I know I can but.....  I can't pretend this is the way it will stay I'm just  Trying to bend the truth. I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be so I'm Lying my way from you.  (no, no turning back now) I wanna be pushed aside so let me go. (no, no turning back now) Let me take back my life,I'd rather be all alone. (no turning back now) Anywhere on my own, 'cus I can see. The very worst part of you is me.  I remember what they taught to me. Remember condesending talk of who I ought to be. Remember listening to all of that and this again. So I pretended up a person that was fittin' in.  And now you think this person really is me so I'm  trying to bend the truth. But the more I push the more I'm pulling away so I'm Lying my way from you.  (no, no turning back now) I wanna be pushed aside so let me go. (no ,no turnng back now) Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone. (no turning back now) Anywhere on my own cuz I can see. The very worst part of you is me.  This isn't what I wanted to be. I never thought that what I said would have you runnin' from me, like this. This isn't what I wanted to be  I never thought that what I said would have you runnin' from me, like this.
