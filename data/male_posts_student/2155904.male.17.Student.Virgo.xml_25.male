Whatever, people will say what they want (whatever that means).  Nothing much to say for once.  That is probably cuz Tyke is not thinking about girls.  Friday should be fun.  Just cuz it is the beginning of the weekend.  Oh yeah and also Tyke is making a new cd but the stupid computer messed up twice when burning it so now he is out of cds so he has to go to Target to get that and film after going to dinner tonight and then he is going to the basketball game tonight with Purdy and Skippy.
