In Tech Assitant, I pretty much stayed there and did nothing. It talked to Melody online. (Melody: giq lew tiy siubf?)   We watched a movie in Biology called Contact. I kind of got into it and heard a quote that was really good.   "[Ellie challenges Palmer to prove the existence of God]  Palmer Joss: Did you love your father?  Ellie Arroway: What?  Palmer Joss: Your dad. Did you love him?  Ellie Arroway: Yes, very much.  Palmer Joss: Prove it."  I went into the computer lab during lunch and worked on my project. It looks cool and I will probably take screen shots of each individual frame to show you guys my superior art skills.   In U.S. History we had a scavenger hunt for historic events around Livermore. I actually found it quite interesting. Unfortunately there was no prize for winning, else the group of three (Me, TJ and Justin) would have got it. We got there first!  Anyways, that is all. Adios!  "Dewey Finn: [improvising some educational sing-song] Math is a wonderful thing. Math is a really cool thing. So get off your ath, let's do some math. Math, math, math, math, math. Three minus four is?  Summer: Negative one.  Dewey Finn: That's right. And six times a billion is?  Marco: Six billion?  Dewey Finn: Nailed it. And fifty-four is forty-five more than what is the answer, Marta?  Marta: Nine.  Dewey Finn: No, it's eight.  Marta: No, it's nine.  Dewey Finn: You're right I was testing you... it's nine. And that's a magic number." --School of Rock
