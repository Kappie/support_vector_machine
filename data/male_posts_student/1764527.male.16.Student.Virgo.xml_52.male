  And I hate it when people flat out lie for no got-damned reason. Don't y'all? Also, if you're gonna lie, why not make it at least  half-way  believable?  Geez.  I  hate  people like that. That's what's got me so fucked up. I hate and love at the same fucking time. Geez. Why don't you just fucking leave me the fuck alone?
