I still have an assignment due next week but since I have the whole week it’s not a big rush. So now I can turn my attention on the matters that I have left alone during the last two weeks. Apart of which is enjoying myself. To that extend I have spend the last two days catching up on my movie/tv watching list.   Lets see, I started on  Sakura Wars: the TV series  and have already caught up to about halfway through the series. I know it is currently showing on TV but it’s hard to catch every episode everyday. Besides there seems to be a greater understanding of the main theme and plots when the episodes are viewed in close succession. You should try it. Pay close attention on character plots, you can really notice the growth in some of them, which is not apparent with a week long break.  It is not really the case with movies however. They are mostly designed to be self-contained. Even the trilogy type movies, all you need is a basic understanding of the plots from the previous movie to see you through the next one. That being said, one of my greatest times I had was when I sat through an eight plus hour marathon of the  Star Wars  Episodes 4 to 6.  Our movies that I caught up with are  Shanghai Knights  staring Jacky Chan and  The Sweetest Thing  staring Cameron Diaz. ( Cameron Diaz  rocks! She is a big favorite of mine and it kinda scary that she keeps reminding me of someone I know, I think it’s the high cheekbones and mannerisms.)    >   Other items I got done involve the blog. I’m looking into moving it onto Pacific Internet for the time being. I don’t really need fancy CGI scripts (at the moment) and at most I’ll add pics, which they have support for. I guess I’ll move again after a few months to a new domain name where I can use software like  urlLink Movabletype  to design and implement a new layout. Perhaps in time for the one year anniversary of me starting the blog?    >   Some good news. Looks like the   >  to upgrade my computer would finally be coming through during the next few days. It’s much reduced from the original amount but hey!…I am happy for what I can get. I will have to top up some of my own cash but since I’ve been saving over the last few months, it’s ok. I’ll most likely take the weekend to get everything up and running again, and by then I’ll have to focus on my assignment, so updates will slow down then. But it’s all good…expect me to be back brand new and better than ever.
