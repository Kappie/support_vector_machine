I went to bed early yesterday at 8:00 pm because I was too tired to be productive, and I awoke today at 3:30 am. Somehow, the fear of the Bar kept me working all day today. I did nap for an hour, but rarely have had such a burst of productivity as I did today. The Bar Examis an amazing motivator.  I will pay tomorrow, no doubt. I will not even start until about 7:30 am thanks to the need for a full night's sleep. Yet onestory gives me hope...  The legend of Ryan Squires is alive and strong in the memories of Baylor Law students. After competing in traveling Mock Trial team competitions, Squires returned to Waco and had only eight days in which to prepare for the Bar. He passed.A fewsay his success was proof oftheproposition thatthe Bar is merely "a test of minimal competency."Most (including me) suggest that what Squires did was amazing. His accomplishmentwillnot be repeated easily.  One thing is certain... I have only seven days until the Bar Exam.Until now, this quarter's workhas not left me with much time to prepare for the Bar. Two of those remaining days involve my last two Baylor Law School final exams. I have reviewed for the MBE, but I have hardly studied the essays. I must survive this Exam. But how?
