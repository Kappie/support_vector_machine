If you're new to my blog, the important bit is the "Me and Laura", and the rest of it you can ignore. Seriously, that ruled... I'm sorry, this is me obsessing. I'll talk about the movie a bit... music for it ruled, 9.5 out of 10 and it only dropped half a mark because it said the name "Christina Aguilera". The plot was typical, and a bit dull. But what completely ruled was that during the opening adverts and such, it was only me and Laura in the room. After a while, I think about 6 people came in, but that was it. I've never been in a showing that empty. It actually felt quite good, it was like being alone with Laura... wait, I've got back to that again. Grr *thwaps self*.  Anyway, got to bugger off. General mood? YAY!  Quote of the day: "One more day all on my own, One more day with him not caring. What a life I might have known... But he never saw me there."  From   One Day More   From   ....you should be able to guess   Love, Jon Roskilly
