I have faith but you know. I sitll like him a lot. Maybe I should tell him I want him back. I was about to. I mellowed out on the phone when I was talking to him. I almost told him I wanted him to give us a second chance. Its hard not to ask him 'cause he's so good. Right now we're friends with benefits and that's not really enough for me, plus if we stay like that, soon it will just dwindle to nothing. Oh well, school sucked today like always and I could really give a shiet anymore since my social life is fucked up and bugged out. I'm going to call him later and tell him I finally took is advice. LoL  Sarah McLaughlin - Push   Every time I look at you the world just melts away All my troubles all my fears dissolve in your affections You've seen me at my weakest but you take me as I am And when you fall you offer me a softer place to land  You stay the course you hold the line you keep it all together You're the one true thing I know I can believe in  I get mad so easy but you give me room to breathe No matter what I say or do 'cause you're to good to fight about it Even when I have to push just to see how far you'll go You wont stoop down to battle but you never turn to go  There are times I cant decide when i cant tell up from down  You make me feel less crazy when otherwise I'd drown But you pick me up and brush me off and tell me I'm OK Sometimes thats just what we need to get us through the day
