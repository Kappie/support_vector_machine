It had an interesting complicated plot, great special effects, and good pace.   My problem with spiderman 2 is, and this is nothing against the makers of it, but I didn't really buy him flying around the city, or maybe I just didn't want to. Anyway, my review: I, Robot spectacular, Spiderman 2 good.
