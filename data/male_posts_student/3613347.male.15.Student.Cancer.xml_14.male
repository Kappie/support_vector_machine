He put back in, and we all went to the back of the class to sign in the Account Logbook. Then i was in the crowd when i saw the Dumb DUMb Chong go to my seat, pick up my "Robinsons The Sale Worth Waiting For" plastic bag and put it on the teacher's chair.   That dumb dumb. I found out that he had seen someone playing with the ball, apparantly it must have been the rolling of the ball out of the plastic bag, and perhaps a couple of kicks when ppl walk past.   THAT DUM DUM. Then he like that say confiscate for 1 month. WHAT THE CRAP. Today supposed to play soccer with Jun Hao lor, who just came back from Australia. He will be going back tomorrow. So of course must treasure this chance. Too bad no Nougat.  NVM. Luckily, Zhi Ming the smart guy helped me get the ball back.   Conclusion: CHONG IS A DUMB DUMB.
