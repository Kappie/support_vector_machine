Or more precisely, the toppings off a pizza - in accordance to my "New nutritional approach" (that's the only way I can say Atkins without getting lynched nowadays). I went to bed early and somehow managed to gear myself up for the weirdest dream I've had in a while. All the significant players from highschool were there, Tassie Hall had been turned into this *enormous* place wherein one of the most elaborate productions I've ever seen was being displayed. There were even folks from work there - some of whom apparently have particularly good singing voices.  It messed with my head completely. It wasn't a nightmare, but it was a dream I was glad to get out of.
