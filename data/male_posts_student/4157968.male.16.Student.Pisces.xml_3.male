And death has nothing to do with it - death is an accident of happiness, in that case.” - Albert Camus   The above quote was pulled from Mr. Camus first novel "A Happy Death" and to me, it says alot. It corellates well with my "death is just another stage of life" philosophy. Camus recognizes that death is inevitable and should'nt factor in to your hapines. In other words, one should not worry about death. I wrote alot more on the subject, but I thought it sounded stupid so I deleted it (not that I don't recognize how stupid this post sounds anyway, atleast there's a good quote). Just haven't really had anything inspired to say since i've been writting this limitations piece, it seems to be taking up the wole good half of my brain.       Alas, enjoy Mr. Camus, and go read all of his books (which i will hencefourth rank in ascending order of goodness):       1. The First Man (a controversial choice, due to its lesser noteriety, but my favorite nonetheless).    2. The Stranger (His most critically acclaimed book, a book which neithr I, nor the man who works the counter at Barnes and Noble could figure out).    3. The Plague (Rusty's favorite, think Nazis).    4. A Happy Death (his First Novel, genuienly bizare, many consider it his precursor to The Stranger   5. The Fall (Still a Great book, just without the certain flair that characterizes his other works)   6. All of his other books which I have't read (The Rebel, The myth of the Sissyphus, Calligula and three other plays, I think he wrote some essays which have been published too, and his notebooks have been published, though i'm not sure if they've been published in English)      To summarize my thoughts on Camus, I shall say that he was "simply the best" and its a horrible shame that he died before being able to grace us with more of his genious.
