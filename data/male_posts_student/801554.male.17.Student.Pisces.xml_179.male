On Tuesday I went to Magic Waters (which is a local water park) with my best friend, on Thursday I went bicycling with that same freind and later we went mini-putting and then bowling, and on Friday I went on a two day catholic retreat with my very very cool freind scott. Fantastic experience, really met some awesome people. Got back today feeling fantastic. FANTASTIC I SAY.  The Villiage, which I did see last Sunday, was good. Yes. See it.
