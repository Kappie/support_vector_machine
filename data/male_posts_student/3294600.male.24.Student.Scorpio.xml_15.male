I sat around and chatted on line for most of the morning until I went to Triangle Alliance at Everett Community College.  This is the organization for homos that is restarting and last week it was decided I'm to be Secretary, which I thought was going to be cool, and hopefully it will again.    I realized before the meeting that if I'm going to be secretary I need to get some supplies paid for by the organzation (paper, ink for printing, notebook, etc).  I checked out the prices and what was available at the bookstore before the 1 PM meeting.  The meeting began and there were a few people there, double what was there last week.  It's very chaotic with little order.  It's interesting taking a bunch of late teenagers and early 20's that are so gun ho about being individuals and leading them to agree on something in a certain way.  What is supposed to be a peaceful hour meeting turned into a two hour stressful crazy all over the place meeting (physically and topically).  I didn't get the supplies I needed because the store closes at 1 on Friday's.  After the meeting I stopped and got lunch at Paradise Burgers here in Smokey Point.  I had fish and chips; they were good and I was stuffed.  Came home to eat it and then went back on-line where I spent most of the afternoon and evening.  A couple interesting things came up on-line.  I found out an old roommate was interested in my physically, which totally took me by surprise.  It went into great detail at times.  I don't know why, but I don't feel comfortable typing everything on here.  I want to and wish I could be fully open, but I have reservations since I don't know who might stumble upon this.  I don't want anyone's feelings hurt.  Maybe I should have made a more anonymous Blog.  *shrug*  Anyway, I'm feeling defeated and frustrated tonight and I don't want to feel that way.  I'm trying to stay optimistic, but I seem to be easily annoyed.  Like right now my roommate is talking on his cell phone, which he talks loud into it, and it's annoying the shit out of me and it really shouldn't be.  I'm trying to concentrate on this, and it's annoying.  Wish he would go to the other room instead sitting in the spare room!  Grrrrrr!  Deep breath...Nope didn't work.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  In all this crap with my Dad, I met one of his friend's named Randy who sold him the truck he had and was going to buy it back for a small amount.  This would be the only money from my Dad's sad life.  I called today to see if I could pick up his payment.  The arragement was to pay the amount in two payments on the 15 of each month.  He has the keys and the truck and I have the title.  The number is disconnected.  I got screwed.  Why am I not surprised...actually I am.  That's why I feel so stupid.  How could I have thought this one person in my Dad's like could possibly be any different than all the other losers he knew?  My trusting screwed me over yet again.  I have the title, but what good is that?  *sigh*  Why does it seem like lately nothing is going right?  Oh yeah, because it's not with the exception of school.  Tomorrow is going to be a busy day!  I am going to a lesbian wedding reception.  They got married last month in Portland.  There are tons of family members from Idaho and other Mormon towns.  This is going to be interesting!  I hate going to things alone.  Another thing adding to my being down.  I relized tonight I haven't really dated anyone since July.  That wasn't even to the stage of love (well, on his part) when he moved to Pullman for WSU.  My last true, loving, long-term relationship ended on December 9, 2000; not that I'm keeping track.  Yeah, roommate is off the phone!  Annoyance fading.  Signing off on a bright note.  Sorry to be negative!  :(
