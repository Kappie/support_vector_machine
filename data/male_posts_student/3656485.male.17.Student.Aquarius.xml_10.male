I think it's fairly humorous and perhaps even wort taking a look at. =) I also wanted to mention that I'm going to start toying around with a website of mine, perhaps replacing my blog? We'll see. I know for sure I want to start taking pictures of places I go and people I'm with to place in a section of my site. Another peice will definately go to Yanni, and of course a third to the wonderful world of ballacrosse. Any other suggestions? Feel free to posr them herrre, and I'll take a gander later on. CHUCH!
