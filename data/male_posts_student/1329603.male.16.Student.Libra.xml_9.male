I'm fed up with everyone telling me that Marcus is better than me. And that he's nicer than me. And is generally superior. NGH.  Anyway, going back home tomorrow, Suz has got a domain and I'm considering leaving And-then to join hers. Iao though. Probably won't. But then again... I'm not going to get a petition done to keep me in, like Marcus did, but I like And-then... then again, probably for the same reason I'd like Suz's... but I'm cut out of enough things without And-then as well...  Love, Jon Roskilly
