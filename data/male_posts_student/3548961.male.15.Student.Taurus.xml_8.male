Also, REPORT CARDS come out today. i haven't gotten my mail yet but im scared. i know its not too bad, i mean i didn't get any d's or u's or anything but i think i have two c's. I know thats sorta weak to be scared about but i honestly don't know how my parents will react.  Any way, no ones bid on the cleats still which is real cool. they only have a day and 8 hours left so i could win them. that would be good. Incidently with the whole soccer thing...my teams last game today we lost 5-0. sortof tops off the season though considering we didn't diserve any more. for those who didn't know, my team wasn't very great and being captain and everything, i can honestly say my team we didn't deserve much so needless to say im trying out for a different team next year. the only set back is that because i haven't been able to play in so long because of the cast, im gonna be terrible. Also im gonna be in california durring united tryouts which means i have to get special tryouts. that sorta sucks. it sucks to play infront of someone alone cause they see every mistake you make. oh man. that means im gonna have to train SUPER hard for the next couple of weeks. so yeah. i think im done for today, i can't think of anything else to write. people don't read this anyway. love always -alex
