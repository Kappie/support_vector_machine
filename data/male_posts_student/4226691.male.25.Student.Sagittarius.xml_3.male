I am not sure why I have such a space, originally, I just wanted to show some support for a friend and comment on her original blog....but then I did something stupid, like sign for blog space...but there you go.  Now I have my very own blog space. And what I am going to do with it? Will it be a beneficial place for mankind?? Can great ideas be expounded open here? Will I allow my creativity to flow out of every pour? NO.  I have decided that I will use this space to ramble, to whine, to bemoan, and to get out all of my stupidity on. I think it will be therapeutic, maybe even cathartic....but more than likely, it will probably be really dumb. But I guess I'll find out.  First subject...what is wrong with people? I mean, you'd think that as a person, like everyone else, you would have some understanding of other people's motivations, and desires, and outlooks. I mean, we can't all be so different?! But yeah that's not true. I just don't get everyone, and I'm pretty sure the feeling is mutual.  I don't think everyone is so damn complex, but we want to convey the appearance of complexity so that we don't look shallow, vain, whiny, and lacking the necessary brain tissue to function. in reality, we are exactly what we don't want to be...with all the negative attributes we despise in other people. We hate hypocrites, and yet we do some pretty contradictory stuff. We don't want to be alone, but yet we do everything in our power to drive people away. We hate liars, and yet, we will stretch the truth if it was in our best interest. That's who we are.  And that's what I don't get. People piss me off. You try and try to be a good friend, a good listener, and a "law abiding" member of society. And what does it get you....nothing. Not a "thanks" or a "glad to have known you" or a "Congratulations for not breaking any laws today certificate." For all the good/productive work that you do for others, you get nothing but higher expectations of your selflessness. People expect you to continue to perform the same way, to go above and beyond the call of duty, and to continue to care about their problems. Selfishness incarnate I tell you.  Maybe I am being a little hard on people. Maybe I expect too much from others. I need to set my expectations on a lower plane...since if you have such low expectations in the first place, it's kind of hard to be disappointed. But fuck that....Who the hell wants to live in a way where their expectations of life and others is frickin low? I want to be happy. I want to have fun, and learn new things and have new experiences. I want to experience crazy and wonderful things...and the only way that is going to happen is with other people.  Even though people are fundamentally annoying, they are the only game in town. I say annoying because of flipflop affect I was talking about earlier. One day, you are absolutely necessary for people's existence, while the next day, you are now yesterdays' news. One day your phone will be ringing off the hook, and the next, no one gives a fuck if you're dead or alive. See, now that's annoying. A little consideration is all that is required. A little word or two would change things in fundamental ways. And yet, I am always the one who has to make the first step, or has to change my methods to interact with people, who has to acquiese to their way of doing things. Bull shit....people need to do the same for me in that case.  Ok, I am feeling better. later
