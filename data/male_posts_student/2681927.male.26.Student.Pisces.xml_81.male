The article says:   "Adjusted for inflation, average hourly wages for non-farm workers, excluding managers and executives, rose 25 cents, to $15.35, between 2001 and 2003. That equates to an annual increase of less than 2 percent, or below the rate of inflation."   So lets see, first we adjust for inflation. Then we calculate how much the wages increased and finish with the comparison between the increased wage and the inflation that we just adjusted for. Just brilliant my dear.  Is it okay for me to go and bang my head into the wall?
