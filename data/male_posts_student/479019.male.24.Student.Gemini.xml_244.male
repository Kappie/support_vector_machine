I just want to comment on how it's really annoying how people tell me to wake up on what a great place the USA compared to other places... when I'm saying that as a superpower we should be working to create peace and prosperity not perpetuating the inequality and suffering in the world. Attitudes like that aren't going to make the world a better place. Sometimes ignorance is bliss I guess.  **
