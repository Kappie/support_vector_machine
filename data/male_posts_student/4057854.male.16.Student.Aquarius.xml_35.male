The telephone survey of 1039 adults living in private households claims that two thirds of US citizens think computer technology is a necessary evil, but four in 10 say they can't live without their computers.  And if a fire affected their houses, after they saved their family and friends, 40% would choose the computer to save next.  Not, apparently, the pooch, the pussy, or the budgerigar.  If this survey really reflects the opinion of your average American, there's something wrong somewhere, surely? After all, if you die, your PC isn't going to be of much use to you, is it?   urlLink Source
