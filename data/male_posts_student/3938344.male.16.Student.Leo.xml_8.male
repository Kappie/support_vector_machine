Crossfade, one of my favorite new bands, was on there, right next to a band called Demon Hunter.  The name sounded somewhat intriguing, so I decided to go to their website (www.demonhunter.net) and see if they had any clips of their songs.  What I found there (Full versions of Not Ready to Die, Infected, The Latest and the Last) made me a huge fan, and impressed me enough that I went the next day to go buy the CD.  I was not disappointed.    I have read many reviews of this CD in the meantime, some good, some bad, most ignoring the fact that this CD stomps so much ass that it doesn't matter if they "sold out by using some melodic songs".  If it sounds this awesome, who gives a flying fuck?  This is another pet peeve of mine (I have many), but I can easily counter that by making one helluva good review.  So, here goes...  Demon Hunter is a little known Christian metal band who has 2 albums: their self-titled effort, released in 2002, and Summer of Darkness, released last May.  I am reviewing the latter, in case you ignored the title of this post.  This CD has many interesting facets to it, including the use of cellos in one song, guest singers from bands like Agony Scene and Thousand-Foot Krutch, and Hunter's lead vocalist's nearly unintelligible growling and incredibly clear singing.  Hardcore metal fans will love growly, fast-paced songs like Not Ready to Die, Beheaded, and Beauty Through the Eyes of a Predator, while fans of lighter stuff will appreciate the singing in their incredible slow songs, My Heartstrings Come Undone and I Play Dead.  Without further ado, here is a complete list of the songs on this album.  1) Not Ready to Die Excellent lyrics, good vocals, awesome guitaring, and an awesome ending.  What more could you ask for?  2) The Awakening An interesting song, this song has the melodic chorus happen before the verses as opposed to after them.  This makes a song that is clearly different from the normal pattern, but still excellent.  3) Beheaded One of their strangest songs ever, this features the singer from Agony Scene singing in what can only be described as a demon voice opposite Hunter's vocalist, which is a lot creepier than it sounds but is a very well done fast metal piece.  Very well done, indeed.    4) My Heartstrings Come Undone Wow.  This is the type of song that separates the whining little wannabe metalists from the true men.  Not only can they pump out awesome heavy, fast metal songs, they can completely change gears and make this incredible demonstration of their talent.  A slow song with metal undercurrents, this is easily one of my favorite songs on the album.    5) Our Faces Fall Apart The Agony Scene singer is back, but this time singing the same words as Hunter's vocalist.  Good intro (especially when listening with headphones), great lyrics, overall good song.  6) Less Than Nothing With this song, I realized something:  If Linkin Park stays around long enough, they might just transform into something reminiscient of this band.  The beginning sounded so much like Papercut, it wasn't funny.  Of course, Less Than Nothing kicked so much more ass than that other one, so it's safe to say that the song is good and original.    7) Summer of Darkness We have a winner!  With a strange, whispered intro, growled verses, a chorus that alternates between singing and growling, and some awesome lyrics, this is my favorite song on the album, hands down.    8) Beauty Through the Eyes of a Predator Not my favorite song on the album, but good nonetheless.  There is a guest singer on this one, though I can't remember what band he's from, and he does a good job getting the edginess in the prechorus down.  As a side note, it sounds like the song is going to end about a minute before it actually does, but then keeps going for one incredible ending.    9) Annihilate the Corrupt A cross between a metal tempo and guitaring and nice, even singing from another guest singer.  A really good song for the home stretch of an album, where many less talented bands crap out usually.    10) I Play Dead Their second slow song on the album, this is one of the most emotional songs by them.  With good lyrics and singing, heavy guitaring, and cello played 2 ways for emotional emphasis, this song will get you feeling for them.    11) Everything was White Even in the last 3 songs, we're still pumping out hits here.  This is a nice, lively lighter song, with good growling and singing.  Excellent.  12) Coffin Builder A darker sounding song, a combination of good lyrics, a strange tempo, and good guest singing from who I think is the singer from Thousand-Foot Krutch make this an irreplaceable addition to the album.    13) The Latest and the Last A very fitting end song, this is heavy and meaningful, with awesome playing to boot.  A good way to finish off this album.    On a side note, this CD is almost 55 minutes long (with no long gaps) -- an excellent length considering I only paid $15 for this CD.  If you're a metal fan, this is your CD.  If you have even a slight interest in metal, this is your CD.  If you've never heard of metal before, this is your CD.  So what are you waiting for? Get off your lazy asses and buy this thing!  Report Card: +good fast songs +slow ones kick ass too +good guest singers +good length +good price  Grade:  A.  This isn't the holy grail of music, but it's damn close. So very close.
