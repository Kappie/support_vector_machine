If you inferred that I got great marks, you get two. If you inferred that I got highest in class, you get the full ten marks!   Yep! That's right, ladies and gents! I got 84/100 for Chem! I am so darn happy with my results (of course, there's room for improvement, like the particle theory...but hey hey!)! An A1. And I maintained my top position for Chem too! YaY!! A good, happy, nice result, something to be proud of.  I hope Physics won't pull it down so much. :)  Yes! I am happy with my results. but somebody ain't. Who leh? Well, ni xin li you su! Who else would complain the whole day about me getting top and keep on cursing meI would fail other subjects? Guess lor. I got a sympathy mark from Mrs Chew (I wrote -2 instead of 2-...but she gave me correct anyway), and he demanded me that I return the mark. So full of integrity and all. And keep on griping about it all day long. Come on lor. If she wants to be sympathic and give me marks, let her give la. Rejecting it would be like rejecting hongbaos. Which is NOT a very nice thing to do.  Then, he complained about me boasting my marks. I happy ma. Cannot tell meh? And keep complaining and complaining and using su yus like "something something qian shou yi" I retorted , "Well, somebody mei you zhi ge to hao lian lor! Want to hao lian also cannot!". Sigh. Then he started being mean towards me. I think, ultimately, he's jealous that I won him yet again. Jeslousy brings you nowhere, my boy.   Today, Yit Hann was being pervertic. He drew pictures of sexual organs (both sexes included) and asked everybody to tell him what he drew. Ew! Then, XC improvised. He drew different pics for the letters of the female sex organ (clue: 6 words). HaHa! But what's funny is that WQ tried to decipher the message, but couldn't get what it is. We thought he don't know how to spell, so we spelt out the word for him. But he still doens't know! Oh my god! He went around asking everybody in the bus what is it. Oh my god! Such embarrassment! Finally, SL told him. He remembered....oh my!!!   Today, I got my quiz prize back. There are three things given to me: a black file, a blue pen and a pad of the school's fool-scap paper. I used the black files for my blog (the old one is full and I printed out September's entries) and the blue pen for use on my computer table. I am giving XC the fool-scap pad. I have no use for it, and he wants it. After all, he helped me confirm some answers. I also got my Bio Practical back. I got 26/40. Not bad ar. Meow meow!  I think I gotta go le. See ya tomorrow. Bye blog!
