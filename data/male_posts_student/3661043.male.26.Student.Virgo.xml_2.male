I returned home to see the notice on the door at 6 o'clock in the evening. So I called the fedex 800 number and told the man that I needed to pick up my package. The man on the other end of the phone told me he would call the Fedex here in Honolulu and tell them I was coming to get my package. A minute later the man gets back on the phone and says that Honolulu Fedex is closing in 10 minutes. I told him the package had fruit that would go bad if it was not picked up today. So he called the Honolulu fedex back and the lady told him she didn't care and hung up on him. He got back on the phone with me and told me what had happened. So then I told him that it was urgent that I pick up the package and that I could be at fedex in 10 minutes. He said that he would try to get hold of the fedex supervisor and tell he/she to wait until I arrived. 2 minutes later he got back on the phone and said that the same lady (Janelle) answered the phone and would not let him speak to her supervisor.  I have used Fedex shipping companies in the past in other parts of the united states and none of them have been so rude and disrespectful has the one here in Honolulu. tomorrow when I go to receive my 15lbs of rotten cherries I think I might take them into Janelle's office and dump them over her desk and tell her thanks for nothing.... Honolulu Fedex is the worst shipping company in the United States.
