I watch people with their friends and their lovers and I know that I will never share that feeling with anyone.  Sure I have people that I call my friends.  But I feel like I'm losing them.  Like they dont even care if I live or die any more.  I have to watch someone I love feel the effects of depression, I have to watch her hate herself.  I have no one to go to, no one in my life any more.  Everything I thought I had accomplished has been burned and I'm left with a never ending grey as the color that dominates my life.  Nothing but pain and lonliness live in me.  I honsetly want to die right now.  I just want to dig away at my body till I've drained all my blood.  Cutting doesn't make me feel any better, it just takes my mind off of the depression for awhile.  Cutting is what I've been doing most of today, just digging away at my wrist with a sharpened pencil.  There's nothing left for me.  I hate this life and I hate who I am.
