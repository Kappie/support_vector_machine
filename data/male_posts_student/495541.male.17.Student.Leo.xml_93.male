I hurried and got to practice and was only about 2 minutes late.  Dispite that, I did my dots and stood around with everyone else and waited for the girls to get done.  I was technically there about 15 minutes before practice actually started, but I was counted late.  What the hell?  Oh well.  Anyways after practice, we went over to Best Buy and got a controller.  My dad also bought a racing wheel because he was actually excited to play the racing game.  I was supprised.  The only thing I was mad about was that he didn't get the DVD remote.  Apparently he got the wheel instead.  How stupid whas that?  Oh well.  After that I just sat around and played some Xbox.  Then I went to the movies with Whit and we were going to see Die  Another Day but again it was sold out.  Wow big supprise.  We saw Two Weeks Noice in stead and I have to admit it was pretty good.  It was a chick flick for sure.  That was really the only highlight of my day.  And even that in some way was a bummer because I wanted to see Bond.  Oh well.  Good night.
