We were gonna see The Day After Tomorrow but then we found out it isn't coming out till the 28th, silly me. Heaton loves destruction and so do I, I'm not sure about James but this movie is gonna be a real treat..who says that. Today I mowed the lawn. Got shorts at Macy's. Drummed for a while, had alot of fun too for some reason. There's days where I'm in the mood and others when I'm not. Well tonight I was and now I'm gonna be all ready for tomorrow's band practice. Whooping. Which reminds me, entensity.net made fun of the decapitation video by making it all Mortal Kombat like with SUB ZERO WINS and WHOOPING, the funny part is it actually fits, the masked Iraqi holding the guys head...ok that's sick, different subject. Ah yes, I came up with a good idea today. I want to either make one war movie with the beginning sad and evil and the end all happy or two movies one being pro war and one being anti war and posting them both on a website and putting Rush's quoted below them both saying about 2 sides that can't be decided on which one to stick with, which one seems better, Republican and Democratic because now the difference between them both is mainly pro and anti war. I don't want the war. Yet I also wanna kill some of those Iraqis after seeing that decapitation video and of course that only fueled some of the sick thoughts I had about killing those "aliens." But I guess we're aliens too. We're not acting human. Or maybe we are because mankind loves war it seems. Maybe aliens are the good ones, yea that's probably it. Anyways I want to put the song "Cygnus X-1: Book II Hemispheres" by Rush in the video I'm making (collecting a bunch of movies and pics from the internet) because this song is all warlike at first and everything is corrupt and human keeps debating over love or reason and then the god of balance comes (Cygnus) and makes the world happy.  "We can walk our road together If our goals are all the same We can run alone and free If we pursue a different aim Let the truth of love be lighted Let the love of truth shine clear Sensibility Armed with sense and liberty With the heart and mind united in a single Perfect Sphere"  Overall, I think war is not the solution. We can pull ourselves together can't we? AH LIGHTNING OUTSIDE!!!!!!! I LOVE STORMS!!!
