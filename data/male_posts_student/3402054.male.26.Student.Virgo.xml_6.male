I move through life in a zombie-like state.  I have only studied for the MBE so far.  I still have DA's office hours to complete on Tuesday through Friday of this week.. exams on Saturday and the following Wednesday and Thursday... a paper and will to draft for Featherston... about 20 or so topics to study for the essay portion... and I still haven't finished reading Property for the MBE.  Of course, today I devote to practice questions--for the first time.  I can sense I have fallen behind.  Arguably, only six days are left completely free for bar study.  Time is in short supply.  After a mandatory grocery run this morning, I intend to hole up in my apartment for as much of the time as possible.  In a strange way, I enjoy this socially-sanctioned opportunity to review all the law I have learned over the last three years.  I just hope enough time remains.
