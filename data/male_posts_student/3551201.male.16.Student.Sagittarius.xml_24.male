On  urlLink Drudge Sunday night , Peggy Noonan, a former Reagan Speechwriter and CBS employee explained how the media feels about covering Reagan. Reagan, the man who was no shy from speaking the truth out was just hated by liberals and the press. They thought he was going to start a World War 3 with his brashness, thought he was just an actor that would be easily beaten in National Elections, and he was just a cowboy type. When he walked out on a meeting with Mikail Gorbachev, liberals were stunned that Reagan would choose to deal with foreign leaders in such a black/white way. The underestimated Reagan, and continue to underestimate Bush. And that could be a good thing come Nov. 2nd. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3 Terms after Reagan produced George W. Bush. When the threat of terrorism was clearly no longer a "law-enforcement" issue, he went out a sought the "rogue nations" that provided a safe haven for them. With an unwaivering position, he called those countries out in front of the entire world. "States like (Iraq, Iran,  North Korea), and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world." he declared in the SOTU Speech, 1/29/02. Showing clarity on his position on the enemy, he added on September 20, 2001, "We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them." Reagan made no distinction in our eneimes and the threats to the world. He called the Soviet Union the "Empire of Evil" and followed his principles, decimating the Soviets and succeeding in winning the final chapter of the Cold War. Neither Reagan or Bush believe(d) that America is superior to any other nation, but that America was strong, too great for small dreams, America was too strong with the will and moral courage of free men and women.  Liberals are now "forced" to play the role of nice kid and praise Reagan. But the main principles Reagan stood for, are the ones that George Bush stand for. A strong national defense, provide tax relief, a strong foreign policy, cherishing freedom, and defeating evil. The Left loved to trash Reagan, just like they do to President Bush these days.  **Update #1**   urlLink What a coincidence, just got an article in my e-mail on Reagan/Bush    urlLink Also, here's another article from CS Monitor on Reagan's impact on the GOP
