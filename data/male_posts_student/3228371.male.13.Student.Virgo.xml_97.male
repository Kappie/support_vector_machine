Okay, is that like... flirting? 'Cos he sucks at it! He asked me out to the movies! -__-" Wtf?! What part of "I have a boyfriend" does he not understand?! Godfrey kept telling him I had a boyfriend and he just kept on going on! -O-" Ingrid's right... oddball! Haha! They're so "mo liu"... walking around Future Shop, KFC, Loblaws, and all that. They have nooo lives! Haha! Now he has my address, AND phone number! Holy crap...! Stalker dude...! Told me to dump my boyfriend 'cos I'm "too young to date". Yeah right! He's only half a year older than me! Calls himself my brother? Yeaaahh okay~! Then he said he had to go and asked when I'd go to bed tonight so I quickly said "around 11pm" and he said he'd call me at 9:30pm. -O-" Spare me! Scary dude... As much as I wanna meet him, I just hope he won't be flirting the whole time... gayness.  He might come to RHCBC tomorrow with Godfrey and stuff to meet me. At first I wanted him to come tomorrow so I can meet him, but now I'm not so sure. Before, he said that he has to go to HIS church to see his girlfriend but then afterwards he said I'm more important so he might come to our church. Butthole. -O-" Feel sorry for his girlfriend. If that was Nima, his ass would be kicked outta the door instantly! Tsk tsk tsk... Scaryness... *points to arm* See? The goosebumps are still there! Ewwyness!
