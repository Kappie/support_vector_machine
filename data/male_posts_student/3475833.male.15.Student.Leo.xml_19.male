I haven't been home for the past 4 days, and I won't be home for the next 2 weeks. I will be in last place no matter what I do. You guys need lifes!!!!  Okay, enough about that. Now onto my birthday party. It was aweomse, I love you guys. Thank you Alyssa for making me have the party. I love my friends so much. Thanks for all the little toys... You guys... Ahh, I don't have words for it. We have the people who skip going to tradition to make it to my party; we have those who come even if they have to come late, we have those who come for the food, loo, joke; we have those who come after the party just to say happy birthday.  Frank you are awesome, that meant a lot to me. I come up to my computer, and you left me an IM saying you weren't sure if you were going to make it, then an hour after the party is over we hear loud music stop outside my house, and it's none other than Frankie. Alyssa runs outside to a bounding hug, and I follow. Sarah later comes out. Frankie's there for maybe only 2 minutes, just long enough to give hugs and wish me a happy birthday and then leaves. It was awesome. He could have stayed if he wanted but he didn't, which means he drove about 15-30 minutes just to say, "Happy Birthday!" It meant so much to me, thanks!  The trip to the store, and Pav's. You guys rock.  Oh, Alyssa, thanks for the cake. To Alyssa and Sarah: Thanks for eating my pudding, I couldn't have eaten it all without you two.
