So I was surprised yesterday when he wrote an  urlLink op-ed in the New York Times  that seemed so, well, wrong.  Basically, he says Bush can get 20 percent of the African American vote this year for four reasons: 1) Faith-based initiatives are popular in the black community; 2) Kerry has done a crappy job of reaching out to blacks voters 3) Bush does a great job of appointing minorities; 4) Two thirds of blacks favor school vouchers.  Thing is, none of that matters because Bush has done such a poor job for his African American constituents on more important issues:  1) As shown in  urlLink a Washington Post poll , 88% of black Americans disapprove of Bush's handling of the war.  2) Bush opposes affirmative action and did so rather publicly during the University Michigan case (to say nothing of the fact that he'll likely use the word "quota" ad nauseum during the debates, as he did in 2000).  3) The  urlLink unemployment rate  for African Americans was 9.9% in May and has been under 10% for only 3 out of the last 12 months.     Black voters see that Bush has done a poor job with the economy, bungled a war that was never popular with them in the first place, and played the wink-wink games with racists that his party always does. If Mr. Williams had said black turnout was going to be dismal, or if he had said Bush might get 10 percent of the black vote, then his argument might add up.  But come November there is very, very little chance that 20 out of every 100 African American voters will cast their ballots for Bush.  Perhaps Mr. Williams was just trying to light a fire under the Kerry camp and, more generally, white Democrats.  If such is the case, kudos to him.
