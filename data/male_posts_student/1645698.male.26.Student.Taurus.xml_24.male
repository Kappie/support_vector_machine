For example, a beer commercial has two guys dreaming about women mud wrestling.  What the hell does that have to do with beer?  Usually the actors are so low rate that they've been kicked out of mime school (god damn I hate those mimes). On the matter of Starburst, well...Those people have no life, their commercial resembles the hang over that I have after a night of heavy drinking. It's very sad that people fall for this kind of advertisements, and of course end up as obesity hippos who can't fit through doors. On the other hand if there is ever a food shortage, we can always eat parts of these people due to their fat. Hopefully it won't come to that. Fat people would love to be thin, and still eat like a damn rhino, so they think that if they switch their diet over to slim fast, but 3 gallons of slim fast won't reduce your weight. Fat people are funny. The funniest fat person was the one who had to  crane lifted  out of his house. Magazines are very horrible, its true that everyone is perfect as themselves but if you want to change to better your life span, then go ahead. These magazines though will not help you, in fact they might cause you to drop into depression and gain more weight.
