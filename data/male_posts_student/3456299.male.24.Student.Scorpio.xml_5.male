But in fact you already know plenty of them. 'animal, index, rumor, maximum, minimum, arena...' Who isn't familiar with these words? Yet all are Latin words taken over into English without change. Latin was mother language of the Romans who lived in Rome.  Usually we say Latin is dead language (and it can be true in speaking ways.) But the influence of the Romans and their language spread over most of Europe and the Near East.  Many modern languages, including English, reflect this influence. (Some will say again, "O.K. Latin has something connected with English, but the time learning for Latin I may pay more time for studying English!" Yes, that's kinda true. But if you hear the hidden benefits of learning Latin, you'll change your thoughts.) Then what can be the benefits of learning Latin? In first, abbreviations we are using are full of Latin like A.D., AM, PM, Ph.D., e.g., etc… so if you know the meanings of them, you can use those more fluently. There are lots of words in English and it's hard to memorize all of it one by one. Using Latin can make you guess the meaning of the word just by morphemes. For example, let's pretend you don't know the word ‘aquarium’ means. But as you know ‘aquarium’ is constituted with ‘aqua’ and ‘arium’, so if you already know ‘aqua’ means ‘water’ in Latin and ‘arium’ means ‘a place where the thing mentioned is found’ in Latin, you can guess ‘aquarium’ as a place related to water. It also can be used just the same on post(after), sub(under), astra(star), sola(sun) etc…  Like this, to guess meanings which you don’t know, Latin can be used to solve these problems. There a lot more that I didn’t mentioned. I’m sorry we don’t have much time for this.  Well, as we can see even though Latin is a dead language knowing or not we are already using lots of words from Latin. If you realized how Latin makes English more easy to those who want to learn English deeply, why don’t you try learning it? It’s still hard work but it’s worth it. [Gratias vobis ago!]
