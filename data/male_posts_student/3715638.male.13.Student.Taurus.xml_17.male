    
        So while I was at camp yesterday(monday) one of my brackets from my braces broke off. It didn't even hurt. It felt like nothing had happened.    Then after camp, my mom and I went to get my dad and sister so that we could go tryout the kayaks that we might buy. So we got there, did the "paperwork" and then were able to get on the types that we wanted. So, we went out to this island and circled around it and then came back and switched boats. I was having so much trouble with the other one I knew that it wasn't going to be mine. So, after that, we bought them. One for me, one for my parents.
