Not that I had any immediate use for the swastika in my font set, but is it really necessary to over react like this??  Small minded people can't get beyond symbols.  These same people make it taboo to have an honest discussion about the quality of Hitler's intellect or the prowess and competence of the Wehrmacht.  To discuss any of these things automatically makes one a Nazi and a racist.
