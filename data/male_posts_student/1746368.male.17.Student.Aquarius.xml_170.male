I just need to work out the random dispension of bonus's and inhibiters and I need to figure out a point system for two players (I don't know how I'm going to do that one) and I need to figure out how to make people lose lives seperately. I have big huge plans for this one! I am also going to make a cool chess game and figure out some kind of twist to it to make it my own. I don't know what yet, but I want to be a game pioneer! I'm going to try to make old games really cool! (Not that chess needs to change; I'll take any of you all on...if you have pogo, add ecclesiastes2111 to your friend's list and I will be happy to play ya!)  Anyways, I just wanted to let you guys know, so if I sound frustrated on the phone/on AIM it's probably because my game is being stupid! Anyways, thanks for reading now the get-up noise. *Gets up*  "Annabell (as Tess): She is dead, worse than dead.
