Tommorrow I am off up Barrys house for a bit so that should fun, dunno what we will be doing though...  Oh and if any of you want to go to a cool message board thing click here... as far as I know it is a newly started up one so it's a bit empty at the moment, it ain't hosted by me but it seems to be picking up a bit of steam now so go and register aslong as you are polite I imagine the owner would be happy for you to stay...  Well thats my bit of advertising done for today, thats about it for now.  See ya  Dan :)   Current mood: Relaxed  Current music: Nickelback - Breathe
