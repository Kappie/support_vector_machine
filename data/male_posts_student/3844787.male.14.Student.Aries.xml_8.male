All i want too do is to go into my own room and get dressed! But he's in there, playing on my new game! Its been raining outside for hours, its just annoying, it means i can't even skate! I might in a bit though, I even left my skateboard outside in the rain last night!So its drenched and getting weaker, which now meansI have too wait too buy a new deck if i skate this one too hard! It sucks! It really does...  More and more people are going on too the skarz site, which means i might be giving up on my old openmind site, this is just so i can concentrate more on the skarz site and hanging out with my freinds, with all of the people going on my site, i'm going too get a hitcounter today, but i'm not sure where i can get a good one from! Its really hard too find things on the web now, its annoying, I can do it, but i just get frustrated so easily!   What I might do is to just start building up my skarz site as best as I can, it already looks quite proffessional, but I want it as best as I can, I have this standard that I always want too reach, I see peoples sites and think how amazing they are, this inspires me a great deal, so I try and learn, like now I have MX Studio, because I want too learn flash, I want too learn flash because i've seen sites like  urlLink http://www.shadyskinning.com .I just like the proffesional look these sites have.  I can't explain the way i feel about this world today, i love it and i hate it, the hate that is revolving around the globe is enormous, but where there is hate, there is also love, i'm beginning too think that hate is just a balance, something that god has put on earth too balance out everything, stuff always comes in twos....  Have I figured out the meaning of life??? Its strange, I realised, that the only certain thing in life... is death, is this the true meaning of life, too die? If it is, then I guess that I just made a fact!
