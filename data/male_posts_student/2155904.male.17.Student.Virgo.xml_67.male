Well maybe not productive but entertaining at least.  1st period rolled through and get this Tyke is not even going to talk about Tina other than this little tidbit of a sentence here.  The assembly they had for diversity week/MLK was decent.  Tyke sat with Haras, Purdy, and Skippy (from right to left and from closest to furthest from Tyke).  The rest of the day progressed smoothly.  Oh yeah, well Tyke lied just a little ago in his blog.  He said he wasn't gonna talk about Tina but now he is.  Tyke has seen Tina and Kram together again and he just doesn't understand it.  He thinks that they are having problems and they decide to split.  But then wait, are they not split?  It is just puzzling to Tyke as he seems to believe that Tina isn't happy or at least she is having problems in the relationship and yet it just continues.  Tyke really doesn't think he should be saying any of this though as it is not his place to say anything and especially on his blog but really he would talk about this with his friends most likely and his friends all read this so this way he can just get it out there instead of having to do it too cumbersomely.  But Tyke apologizes for any toes he steps on or if he is being inconsiderate or even just too nosy (pretty much just speaking to Tina here if she actually reads this but he still does not believe he does-if she does then she should get online and IM him, homestar wunna3, yeah thats right he just put is SN on the internet but that is the beauty of blocking people cuz he can just block everyone who annoys him).  Well anyway the rest of the day was good.  After school Macaroon called Tyke on Dr. Phil's cell and asked if he wanted to come up and hang out.  Tyke jumped on the offer to do so and Fejj came over and then Amed came over.  Later on Skippy even came over.  They played Halo again and it was a grand ol' time.  Tyke came home and didn't really do anything and still hasn't done anything actually.  He hasn't done homework at night for at least a month now.  Counting break that is.  But still he has not studied, learned or done anything at home for more than a month.  He is just flat out giving up on school it seems like.  He is still completing the homework and doing well enough on tests but he is far from focused.  Friends, blogging, and AIM have taken over his life.  And yet he is fine with that.  Haras and Tyke talked for some of the night.  Just about some really deep things.  Ya know, like the existence of a parallel universe and the infinitesimal nature of a grain of sand (for your sake Tyke hopes you didn't actually believe that).  But then they both went to watch Friends.  However, there has been some groundbreaking news tonight that could really end up affecting millions of people around the world.  No, seriously.  If everything happens how Tyke and Amed are hoping it will happen then they both will be very well-off and the world over will be better just by knowing them.  Confused as to what this subject is?  Well Tyke and Amed decided that they are going to partake in an endeavor that could bring to them great riches and hot bitches (that was used as nothing more than a great rhyme...no literal meaning) or it will just be a long time spent on doing something that could still be self-satisfying.  Yes, this endeavor is a novel.  Not a novellete or anything like that.  A full on novel.  They talked for a little while just brainstorming ideas and though they don't want to give too much away, here is the proposed storyline.  Two people live separate lives, a Socialist Russian growing up in hard times loathing the land of the free and the home of the brave and a young middle-class American girl who seems to be quite content with her life but is deep down a hopeless romantic longing for more.  Will these two ever cross paths (of course they will or it would be an idiotic book).  But how will they meet and under what circumstances will these two flourish?  Stay tuned to hear more.  Actually you probably won't hear much more.  But they plan to write like a real novel, 200 pages or so, an intricate plot, fully developed characters that are highly relatable.  This should be a striking escapade in the talented lives of the two young men from the foothills of the majestic state of Washington.  Tyke and his crew, however, have also planned an adventure for Friday.  And this is going to be a blast!  Friday basketball is getting started once again.  It should be a real fun time.  The crew is getting reassembled with a few key returners and the usual star Tyke Turner leading the way but some impact newcomers are gonna try to make a showing in their first attempt at carpet basketball.  Tyke will be getting out his headband and sweatbands, his beater, and definitely his really good shooting skills.  He loves basketball.  Tyke+sports=oh man this is really fun to do because Tyke is good at most of them even though he isn't real strong or big but he is still pretty talented and agile and quick and smart and knows the game well.  Tyke is really looking forward to the 3-day weekend even though it means that he should be doing a lot of homework and studying.  He probably won't though because he really isn't big on doing stuff like that.  Now if he was working on getting into the home of a girl (get it homework-working home???) or studying the bodacious bodies of females then maybe he would be more inclined to put his skills to the test.  But he's not.  Well, at least he hasn't been offered.  Offers are still acceptable.  And offers for the president of his fan club are still out there.  Actually nobody seems to be jumping over that job.  It really isn't a job.  More of just something to put on a resume.  Speaking of resumes Tyke just realized that the Friends series is almost over.  Which means no more Friends parties.  Speaking of Friends parties there hasn't been one in at least 6 years (1 year=approximately 1 week).  That should be annihiliated with the Friends party of a lifetime.  Like for the series finale if there isn't one, Tyke might have to have one at his house.  Cuz there should be.  His parents may not even care.  Cuz that will be during second semester and who the hell gives a care about second semester?  Has anyone noticed how Tyke tones down the swearing on this blog?  He thinks it is just to try and keep it safe for all those people who may read it and don't like it when people swear, which Tyke respects.  Sure he swears like a Swearing Sailor at times but that is just cuz it is fun to do.  He means no harm.  Sometimes at least.  And really, isn't it better to not offend most than not please some?  It is all about the majority in Tyke's blog.  Sorry, but it be the truth.  Or if you are a really nice person you might get preferential treatment.  And yeah, if you are a female you are already at like +38.  So you pretty much are set.  Goodnight and join Tyke and Brandy (singing "Have You Ever" in the background right now) next time.  You all have a safe drive home, ya hear?
