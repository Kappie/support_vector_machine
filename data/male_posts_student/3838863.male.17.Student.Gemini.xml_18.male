Better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.  As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.  Proverbs 27:5,6,10b,17  Invitation: Pastor Samuel Wang shared something about his life:  Everytime my phone rings in the middle of the night, My wife will jump up and stare blankly at me. We are often troubled by these calls. Fearing that it may be news of an accident, a deceased relative or someone in times of troubles, we hestitate to pick up the call. In my attempt to comfort her, I will always advice her to ignore the call and go to bed. However, my wife wll jump at the phone call saying, "Perhaps it's something important. Perhaps someone is in need. I'll answer." God is more like my wife. He answers. Even when it is in times of troubles.  Last Sunday, Dr Gary Chong shared about the blessings of friendship. "As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another." In the bB, we often sharpen each other.  For the company's good i said. For the individual's good i believed.  Were my motives right?  What was i trying to achieve? To shape the Boy, or to boast about my 'wisdom'.  I've sinned and fell short of the glory of the Lord. A pharisee I am. Stabbing you 'for your own good'. In the context of lending a hand, I'll make you fall flat on the floor.  Perhaps it's meritocracy. It's the system. To climb up high, i'll have to step on others' heads. Perhaps it's our kiasu culture. To feel better, I must overtake him. No.  Its not the system. Nor the culture.  It's my sinful nature. It's my pride. With a coat and a tie on my back, i thought i have scaled the highest peaks.  Lord, let me be like Nicodemus. Through the darkest hour. Come with a gift to Thee. Give me a humble and pure heart. Keep my ways pure and holy. Give me the right reasons to sharpen my friends.  Keep me blameless. till i see Your Face. Amen.
