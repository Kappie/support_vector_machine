She's a really neat lady who lived through world wars, the depression, the influenza epidemic, and... well... everything in the last 95 years.  She once told me about flying in an open cockpit two seater plane with some beau or another, even though her mother wouldn't have approved: "If I die, she can't yell at me" she said.  Happy Birthday Grandma!
