    
       So I'm about ready to post some new GMail pictures through the Hello program for Blogger, but it wants me to verify my email address.  Sure, I'm using my GMail account to manage this account so I have it send an automated email to my account.  I'm waiting....I'm waiting, clicking refresh, signing in-and-out of GMail, and still nothing.  I get so tired of waiting that I change the address that Hello uses for me to my Yahoo account.  No problem there, I receive the email in less than a minute.  AGAIN, WHAT's GOING ON WITH GMAIL?  I sure hope I get those messages soon.
