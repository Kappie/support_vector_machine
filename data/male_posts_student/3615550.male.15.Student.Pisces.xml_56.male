I'm the last blogger left who is willing to post.    At least David Sessions is posting.  And he's doing it with great frequency as well; allow me to renew my command to GO VISIT HIS BLOG (which I presently can't provide a link to)!  Maybe I'll do a little searching of the Blogger profile index.  Then I'll e-mail Blogger support to find out what's going on with the publishing interface.  I also just realized that I need to eat lunch.    I just noticed, D2M and Sara updated yesterday, so that's a plus.  For all you Blogspot users, do you still have the "add link" option on your publishing page?    Well, I just thought I'd update you on what's going on around here.  Be blessed, y'all.
