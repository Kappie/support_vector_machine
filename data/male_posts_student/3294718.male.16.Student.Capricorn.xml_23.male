Today, I was wearing my Bad Religion T-shirt, which 600 people have told me offends them (even though they have no idea what it means). So I went over to my moms for a while, and she took one look at my shirt and said, "I don't know why you are so different, Josh."   Well, I don't know why you're so freaking nuts, mom.
