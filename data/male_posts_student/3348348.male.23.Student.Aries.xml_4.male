Yesterday I talked to my cousin erik and he told me I need to get my ticket asap, so I will call him tomorrow to do that.   I've been studying math for the last couple of weeks, and it's nice to se the proofs I do are right I should have a nice idea of what analysis actually is before the end of the summer. Also studied for the gre on friday and I guess it won't be hard doing it again because I still have it.  Classes are going ok, they could be more interesting, I finally understand metrics this time around and that's nice to know, also after class I talked a bit with Barbara, I've always have liked her and let's see what's her situation and what can happen there. Continuing in that line I've always wanted to go out with laurita and that has been closer than ever to happening but I always chicken out at the last moment and I don't know why, it's stupid because I thought I was over this kind of shit since april when I finally approached a girl without giving it too much thought but with her things seem to be different, I'll try to see if I finally go out with her this week, there's nothing to fear and anyways I won't be here for long so I have to do this.  It's been hotter than ever the last couple of days and you can't deny summer is finally here, not that there's any other season here but it's never this hot during the rest of the year, and the power outages don't help either, I haven't been too self concerned or depresive lately because I finally see an end to my life here, I can't wait to live in the city my forefathers had to leave because of a stupid dictator and learning more about economics and my roots, but I still have to wait a couple of months for that.  On another note I feel my group is breaking up, everybody is taking their own direction, except for Cesar who looks like he's going to Barcelona too, stimps is going back to his high school group and willie is with his party friends, I feel kind of bad about this but at the same time it was going to happen sometime and having nothing to do helps me study which aint half bad, I should study more though...  Anyways this is all for now, I'll post again next week
