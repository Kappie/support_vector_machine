Vampire was very good, Rattlesnake was ok, Samuri had fallen down, and, shock horror, Beanoland was closed.  The longest queue was infact for Mcdonalds, the robbing bastards. They gave out free Happy Meals to the kiddies, so therefore we had to eat there aswell.  Overall, I would advise my many fans that Thorpe Park would be a better choice to go for if you wanna go to a Park.  mmmmmmm..cat
