Basically, I'm in a self-defense/philosophy course taught by Mr. Everitt, along with, Jonah, Floyd, Heather, Laura, and one more girl who's identity I can't quite recall, though it seems to me she was Asian.  At one point we had a philisophical discussion, at one point I fought Floyd while the rest of the class critiqued us, and later we played a snowboarding arcade game.  Laura seemed very lost throughout this whole thing.
