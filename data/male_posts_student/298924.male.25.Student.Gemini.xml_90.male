It is again time for the  urlLink Honda Campus All Star Competition  in Orlando, FL(by the way on the page they are promoting the Honda magazine ad that has me featured prominantly in case you haven't seen it)....in case you just happened to fall here (how does that happen) and didn't know I was on the National Champion Morehouse team last year....I wear the ring for it proudly, as not many people have a national championship in anything to their name....  Anyway, according to the latest scoreboards we are again running amuck....last year we broke all sorts of records scoring over 4000 points in the round robin portion....They aren't on that kind of pace this time it appears....but still a repeat seems immenent....  This reminds me of one of the finest moments in my young life so far....this time last year we were enthralled in the toughest game our team had faced.....we were down against Jackson State in the round of eight....our usually reliable leading scorer was struggling that round and he was feeling down and out....my role with the team up to that point was a mix of odd trivia master/wiley veteran....I was not the most prolific scorer but I was consistant and I didn't miss many questions (missing takes away points)....at any rate we were down to the last few seconds and long story short I answered the winning question (the answer was Portugal....I'll never forget it)....yep....I was the John Paxson or Francisco Cabrera for that day....I might never have another moment where I shine like that again....but I will always remember it....everytime I look at my championship ring.....  I hope John, Jay, Jared, Rubani, and this year's freshman get to do it again!!....Go Morehouse!
