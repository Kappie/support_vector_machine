On a brighter note, the youth service went well. My compliments to everyone who participated and showed that they have more guts than i do. Stu was in almost everything. That guy has some serious tallent. What is up with the rain today? The "hurricane" was yesterday people!! I guess i'm depressed that i'm stuck inside again. Yep. stuck inside with 3 younger siblings(one of which has been screaming at the top of her lungs all morning. It's driving me nuts!! All of you with siblings that are older than 7 count yourselves lucky. Anyway, I have to go do nothing. Catch u later my home dogs. (ghetto is such a weird languge) SJD
