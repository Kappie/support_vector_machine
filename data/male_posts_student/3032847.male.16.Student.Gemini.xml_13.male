Bollocks, wish I'd learnt it first time around, instead of leaving it literally to the last minute. Shouldn't have gone down the pub earlier on for me dinner. Me mams still there, whats that.. 6 hours of drinking with me aunty nd them? And she still hasn't brought the chinese home! Me dads just came in and he's full of hell...  ON THE BRIGHT SIDE! Half time- England 1, France- FUCK ALL! WHOOPEEE! Oh well back to my titrations and Haber processes and all that shite...
