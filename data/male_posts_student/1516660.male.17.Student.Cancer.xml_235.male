Woo-hoo! I am so so so happy! My wish came through! HAHAHA!! CQ, YH and PY are going to PJ too! Woo-hoo! Yao shu lor!! HeHe!!   WQ, however, did not get into PJ. He got into YJ. He's so totally upset aobut it. Hmm...so I suggested to him to go appeal to get into PJC. If he failed, at least he tried, right? It was I who persuaded him too. HaHa. So, therefore, I am accompanying him to PJ to appeal.   After lunch, I met WQ at Woodlands MRT at 1pm. We travelled Choa Chu Kang MRT Station, where we took a bus to some bus stop near PJ. HaHa. I was feeling so darn nervous, more nervous than the applicant. I was imaginging we had to speak to the principal ma, and as WQ don't have much of eloquence, I had to do the talking. I was so nervous.  Crazy old me. I even called CQ to try to soothe myself. We had to sign ourselves in, and then go into the General Office. We stood around for awhile, then one of the staff came to us to help. You know what? All WQ had to do is fill up some forms and wait for the approval to results! Made me worried for nothing. Ohn yeah WQ: Good luck for your approval! :)  After that, we went to Lot 1 to eat LJS. Mainly WQ eat la. I ate some fries and read my Harry Potter book. After that, he came to my house to play PS. HaHa. He left at 5 something.  Ya know, I was watching Ben Yue as usual. There's this short little animation about Hou Yi shooting down 9 suns. HaHa! That reminded me of the performance that I participated in while in Primary 5. That year, my school was holding a Mid-Autumn Festival celebration. There was this performance about Hup Yi shooting down the 9 suns. i signed up as a performer and got the part of one of the 9 suns. I can still remember the actions! The suns had to stand up on chairs. Once a sun was shot down, the respective actor/ess had to turn back, twirl around and land on the floor. HaHa! So fun man! Ahh...the gold ole days! :D  Hm...today, I started eating gua zi. So fun man! Biting the melon seeds, hearing the crack sounds and eating the white thingy. So fun! That's the whole idea of eating gua zi ma. WQ said he's too lazy to open up the shells, and hope in the future all the seeds will be opened (using a machine) already for sale. I say, that idea is one of the most silliest things I heard. Part of the fun of eating gua zi is opening them yourself by biting. Ayioh...if anybody dares to sell opened gua zi, I'll bet they will have low sales. Seriously. Would you buy an already opened gua zi? I wouldn't, for sure!  Hm...later got Charmed, Naughty Nymphs. I think I am ending this entry le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
