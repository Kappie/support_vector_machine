I was top salesman for the day, I help people actually make worthwhile purchases and I helped one over-weight, over-indulgenent bitch. She made a statement something like You must love jewelry as much as I do since you work here.  Fuck you cunt! Jewelry is right there next to picking up dog shit on my list of things that make me vomit. I am looking forward to some meditation on the top of all this bull mess.  I have to say, I am really enjoying helping people that can't speak english very well. I am serious. Fuck all these rich-ass white people, give me some good-hearted hispanics and I will spend hours showing them jewelry. I helped this couple a few weeks ago. Carlos and Virginia. They were super nice, I was never pushy at all so today they come back and I show them wedding bands for about an hour. I was stoked to help them out. I can surprisingly understand most of what they say in spanish. That made me feel good about myself. Kiss my ass if you think I am racist. I love everyone, esp hispanics. All of my best friends have been hispanic except for jake and josh.  Integirty is something to behold and Spanish is a bad ass language! MiMi kicked my ass again at abalone.   current mood:  cheerful current music: Geoff Farina - Car
