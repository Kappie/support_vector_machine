Well, haven't done much lately, just worked and worked, and some more work. Lookin at Uni's and getting my Section 10 sorted (bit by bit). Been to the Pub a few times, it's crap luck that you guys couldn't make it. I'm sure you're Greece trip is going swimmingly... if you catch my drift... he he, 2 jokes. That's pretty good for me.......... I'll get my coat now. 

------------------------------ 

Cool, I'm looking forward to all the PARTIES!!!, hoping for a bit of laugh and a bit of a drink. It's good to be home. I wish I had more time with everyone, but hey... times are hard and time tighter. 

We've got shitty twat head neighbours, who bad mouth us all the time to people (who naturally tell us they do) and tonight, their little bitch spawn kicked her fball into our garden, knocked the door and had the f'in cheek to ask for it back!! I damn well popped that little tweenie ball and pissed on it before I posted back through their letter box!............. I wish I had, really I do. She went and got it back, but I'm watching her, ready with my tranquilizer gun! 

OK, i've babbled enough, time for my fix of TV. Peace out
