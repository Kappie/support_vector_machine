They've never not been in the media, and I think from here on out we're going to start seeing them for what they really are, or at least, will be...  Utter weirdos.  These kids are going to be weirder than anything Michael Jackson, David Koresh, or Odd Nerdrum ever imagined.  Their lives have always been on television, and I am absolutely positive that their constant publicity has tainted their subconsciouses far more than we realize... and now with all the hoopla over them being "legal", the pervs will crawl out of their walls, proudly proclaiming that it'll be legal when they jerk-off to pictures of the pair.  The psychological damage will mount as these two girls realize they're the nerd fantasy of every creep in the United States, and before we all know it, they'll disappear from the public eye to go devote themselves to some sort of Neo-Nazi psychic cult in Boulder, Colorado.  I feel sorry for them.
