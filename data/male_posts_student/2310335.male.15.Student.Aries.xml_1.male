On a second note, I had my computer viva today. Well, it went well except for the fact that I did not have my copy which really dint make a difference. I just hope I get 10/10 for my internal assessment. Also, I created a table named hippo and entered a row named mouse killer 2. Well, it should have read mouse killer Jr. but doesn’t really make a difference coz I got my point across to Ragini(mouse killer jr.) who is the daughter of mouse killer sr.(nandini dasgupta). I am in trouble now….! And then there was the ever-boring English period, my teacher is Sudeshna so u know what I am in for. But, I bunked it so yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!! Then there was P.E. Actually, P.E. was a miracle period today as I was playin basketball, which I am too short for, but every shot it took went in…ahh luck! Then we had free period in which I disturbed Savita Chadhas class. After that is all history but jus one thing  I got to talk to Tanya shukla in the last 2 periods which was good as I haven’t talked to many ppl in the past many days I duno wat ill do in skool morrow  Hasta lavista baby P.S.: I’ll be back gudi
