That naturally reminds one  of the Parliament and other legislative bodies where this isa common practice.  But the comparison ends there. The class is too orderly to be compared to our unruly Parliament. People are not allowed to rush to the well of the class (the stage), everybody listens (or pretends to listen) to the 'speaker', questions are asked politely, Deve Gowda-style sleeping is not appreciated, walk-outs are impossible, late attendance is frowned upon, there is an attendance requirement for each session (80%), there are no Treasury and Opposition benches as there is only one party - that of the students, and of course, many others.  Two other likenesses of the class to our Parliament is that the representation of women is less than 33% (although it is increasing year by year) :), and video recordings of the class occur occasionally.
