It started to dump some snow on Coug Mount earlier tonight but it stopped pretty quickly.  Well today was pretty fun.  Went to the mall with Skippy, Amed, Kinker, and Macaroon.  Tyke got his watch sized finally so he can wear it now.  It is still kinda big and prolly shoulda gotten another link taken off.  BUT HE IS SO SKINNY!  He is so freaking skinny.  But still hot.  Yeah, and that was fun.  He had some Panda for lunch.  Panda can taste very good.  But don't eat too much of it.  Then they all went home.  At 6 they got back together and played Halo and made 2 more videos.  The guys didn't seem to want to make Tyke's video even though it would prolly be real good.  Just cuz Tyke is the king of the video-making industry.  He is the best talent and also quite good at directing.  Only Amed could give him a run for his money on camera though.  But Tyke still reigns supreme.  For now at least.  But they made another edition of the Chris Landreth Show where they roasted Tyronius.  It was ok.  Not as good as the first though.  But every time I close my eyes I thank the lord I've got you.  And you've got me too.  Not to mention the next episode of Talking Sex.  It had its moments but was far from the quality of the first one.  Tyke did for some reason or another get topless and dance around and do a lap dance.  He has absolutely no idea why he did that actually.  Wow, that was real gay what he did.  Oh well whatever...he is still totally straight.  No gay thoughts at all.  He was freaked out by all the touching he was getting from the other guys in the hot tub so don't worry...he isn't gay.  HE LIKES GIRLS!!!  But whatever...slow songs are playing on his cd right now.  He just keeps bringing himself down with his music selection.  But the songs are so beautiful he just can't stop listening to them.  He is only missing one thing with the music.  And it is obvious what that is.  But at least the song that is playing now isn't true for him anymore.  Nobody Knows it But Me by Babyface is playing.  But in his case everybody knows it.  Including her.  She doesn't even need a name anymore.  She is infamous.  It is her and she is it.  The one, the only.  Oh yeah, Dottie is back and she talked to Tyke for a little at night.  Awesome gal.  TOMORROW IS HERE!!! "The nights are so long...the days are so sad...and I just keep thinking about the love that we had...and I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me."
