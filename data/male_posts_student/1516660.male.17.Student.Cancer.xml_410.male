I am so terribly innocent! Okay...lets start with Saturday!   Saturday   Okie dokie. Today is mainly PW day. My group members are coming over to do PW. Yes!   Okay. In the morning I did my PW minutes lor. PW PW PW meows the ducks! Oh why yes!   Okay. I also finished editing Two Fanthoms Deep and am now putting all editions on the pieces of paper into the computer. Yeah. It's going great and all, yeah. I just need more time.   Okie. All of them came at 2.30+. Yep. Okay. Here goes a long long day! First off, Tham wanted us to do reviews for everyone of our articles. I've found out that I've got very very little articles. About 4. Sigh. I die liao la.   After that, we got onto doing group articles. HaHa. We numbered articles and we did them lor. Took us a whole big while. Of course, we chatted while we talked. WE talked about a lot of things, like JH's crush. HaHa.   Yeah. By dinner-time, we still haven't finished yet. They had to go down to 768 to buy dinner back home. I was eating my dinner and watching The Simpsons. After that I went to bath and went back to PWing lor.   Yeah. We finished about 11+. We were each given 2 group reviews, our indiviual reviews and our own PW Written Report chapter to write. Sigh. I also have the added burden of re-arranging the minutes. Sigh. Even ducks would meow at such a workload! I don't think I can do my homework le la. Sigh.   Sunday   Okie dokie! Today 4/5 had a gathering at Sentosa! Wheee!   Okay. We are supposed to meet at 9 at Woodlands Interchange. However, we only set off at 10. Yeah. Ayiah...meow moo.   Okay. We went to this food centre to eat first. After that, we joined the long long queue towards Sentosa.   Yeah. We met Kelvin and Teng Fei at Siloso Beach. Oh boy, was it big? Terribly big! Me, Manda, Cq, SL and XueLin went off to wade a little. HaHa. We even sat down on the pier and dangled our legs in the water. Like that also fun. After that, we went back.  Okay. This is where the nightmare began. Sigh. WQ somehow found a plastic bottle and took great fun with splashing water on me with that blasted thing. I AM SO KILLING THAT IDIOT WHO LITTERED! I don't know what the hell was wrong with him lor. Why des he take sadistic pleasure in torturing me? He needs to have his head checked. Badly.   Sigh. I was dragged into the water. Sigh. First, that GaoLuan tried to pull me in. Luckily, I have nails. I used them. He let go, and I am very proud to say that I inflicted wounds on him. Serve him right. Then, Hann tried. That GL came and attacked me lor. WQ took opportunity to pour more water on me. I hate it la. My clothes are all wet and sticky with sand. I might as well go down. I still hate GL and WQ. Idiots. I inflicted nail wounds on Hann too, but they are not deep. Okay. Sigh of relief. I don't want to hurt Hann. I wish I have Piper's powers. I so badly want to blow WQ up to pieces. So so badly. That's why I don't have powers. I'll misuse them.   Yeah. Wanna hear more stories of WQ's sadist nature? I was like trying to pull him down the sea...then he gave me a hard slap and shouted "My arm's injured la!". Everyone who witnessed was so horrified. How can a friend do that to his friend? Me. I was shocked, but it did not hurt. I got used to it. I guess he must really hate me. Come on. I don't even slap strangers. Or people I hate. Even my friend (cannot reveal name) was telling me to slap back. Sigh. WQ's such an egnima. I don't know how to say la. I hope one day, he feels really guilty for whatever he has done. (I am a big believer of karma. It's gonna catch up on him someday and hit him so hard that he will regret immensely every curel thing he did. A guy can always dream, right? :P) But when that day comes, the sky's gonna fall down. Such creature being capable of guilt? Ha!   Right. Once I stayed in the water, I felt so much like home. I began to connect with Phoebe (A Mermaid's Tail, Charmed Season 5's first episode). The seas's my home. I was unwilling to leave it.   When I left...oh man. I began to feel ill. The sun's very glaring...my sores hurt...I can't see anything and they wanted to play games. I tried to play, but my head hurts.   After a while, we went back into the water again. Oh my...it felt so good! I don't ever want to leave it. I stayed there as long as I could, whilst dodging missles from Hann's rabid 'fans'. HaHa.   After some photos, we finally went to change. Ahh...the first toilet we went to was crowded, so we went to the next. We walked and walked...and finally reached that blasted place. Woah...after taking a shower, I felt so good. Okay, not really. My skin hurts. I got sunburnt. Sigh...  After Sentosa, we went to City Hall. We wanted to catch the fireworks at the Esplanade. Yes! Unfortunately, KH decided to tag along. I was like O.O! Most of us don't like him lor. I was like "I don't want him around, but as long as he doesn't bother me, I don't care".   We ate lor. After that, we went to the Padang to watch the fireworks. We reached there about 7.40, but it doesn't start till 8.30. We chit-chatted. Meow moo!   WoW! The fireworks were spectacular! It's like so meowful! So beautiful. During the climax, you can really feel the whole place shaking with each BOOM BOOM BOOM! So nice. You really had to be there to enjoy it. Watching it on TV isn't the same.   We went back lor. HaHa! I want to laugh to death! HaHa! Xiao shu lin wor! That WQ tried to sabo me. He was trying to make everyone tell me ghost stories so that I would be scared when walking back home. I tried to point out the fact that I got Janet besides me. He can't listen, or he pretended not to. Either way, SL told her NP ghost stories and CQ narrated MeiTing's experience. That WQ was scared shitless and he was like saying "Stop leh..I am going home alone". I was like so laughing myself to tears! Who was the one who wanted people to tell ghost stories de ar? HAHAHAHA! This is caled retribution! HAHAHA! Zhi tao ku chi! HAHAHAHA!   Okay. I went back, bathed and slept.   I enjoyed today, because I got to meet all my 4/5 friends again. I had a great time! I felt so happy being able to talk to people like Amanda, Zue Lin and Shin Han again. HaHa. I didn't regret going to today's outing. :D   Today   Okay. Today we are going to Clementi's KTV World. Yeah. We met at Causeway Point and went there lor. We waited for PY and Joyce before going to sing.  Like again, they don't have English songs. Not new ones. I felt quite proud of myself for singing quite a bit. I might have gone off-pitch at times, but I enjoyed myself. :)   After that, we went to Causeway Point. They wanted to eat KFC, but it was full, so they went to Marsiling instead. Oh yes. I brought Ocean Ou De Yang's album. His songs are very very nice. Especially Xiu Xiu Xiu! YES!! Nice album. $18.95 didn't go wasted.   Okay. We went to Marsiling and waited for CQ and PY to come. They finally came and I was like a sigh of relief. Someone else to talk to at last. Other than the girls (who I have no problems connecting with), I felt pretty bored. Yeah. Me, Gloria, CQ and WQ shared a meal. Yeah.   We sat down and talked lor. Ayioh...all of them started to talk about me and WQ. They went "Oh! You slapped KY ar?". HaHa! Don't know what their intentions are, but of course, they are standing by me. Who would agree with the slapper, and not the victim. Unless they hate the victim la, but they don't hate me. :P Anyhoo, they were like saying me and WQ don't talk. Yeah, true. He didn't want to talk to me de ma. I mean, today's conversations between us right, he was either insulting me or talking about stupid things. Why can't I read the newspaper slowly? That idiot feels the need to poke his nose into my reading speed. Siao. I didn't talk to him, and basically avoided him lor. Yeah, some of my excuses for not sitting besides him were lame (my butt's too big for the space in between him and HuiLing), but the "sun shining on my neck" reason was really true ma. If he expects me to be friendly after that bullying yesterday, I think he must be off his rocker.   We also talked about a whole lot more of things. HaHa. Mainly about Joyce's life as the rich Mrs Ong (Joyce la, who else?) and her married life with Mr Ong. HAHA! So funny one. We were laughing ourselves to bits.   Okay. So we went home at 6+. I didn't miss the choir singing at all. Okay, I missed two while in the shower. The choir sang a pathetic amount of songs this year. I wonder why they cut away the choir time. Stupid people. This year's NDP was not so bad la. I only slept for 5 minutes. HaHa!   After NDP came Singapore Idol. Yeah, I liked that show. I really liked Gurmit the host. I felt that he was the 'big brother' when he was comforting Rocky Wang. So loving. The contestants were not bad. I didn't met anyone who WOWed me, but I find a lot of them whiny. The judges are not bad. Ken Lim looks very strict, and he's brutual and honest. The rest of the judges are more outgoing and friendly, and they know their stuff la. Yeah.   After that was online time, and then Friends. Joey can't speak French correctly to save his life. HaHa! So funny!   Okay. I gotta go le. It's about 13.36am Tuesday. Woah. Tired le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
