Alot of nice poets (one especially disturbing poem), and a decent crowd (18 people showed up who didn't help add to the helpers and we had like 25ish people).   The Feature Poet, Jamal St. John, was particurally good.  I'm pissed that I was the only person holding down CHS though, that's pretty annoying since mad pendajos says to me says "Yeah, I wanna go."  Pendajos.  It was mostly girls, except me, and the other NNB member (I'm not talented enough to spell his name) and Chris the OG Nangila member.  Most of the girls were pretty, so everything was made up for with that and the content of what they said.  Before that, we did an FNL filming.  Quite cold, but quite funny.  You'll have to wait for the show to see that.  It was good stuff.
