Sam told me at break that all the teachers know about my blog... what blog?  I don't have a clue what he was on about... Mwahaha  Okay, so the teachers really have discovered my lovely little place in which I chat to myself, basically.  Hope you all like the blog and find it a really cool read!  God knows who told them about it.  Some people may think I did it myself to get visits... funny thought but no, I want to know who told them!  Please note, if you don't wish certain views of your pupils to be read by you, I suggest you buzz off because it just might happen!  Anyways, the rest of the day was alrite.  Information Systems was cool because Mrs. Checketts used the flashy new projector things; little did she know that the laser beam on the controller kept shining in my eye when she was making gestures with her hands.  Hmm... I think I'm getting punished for making that nasty comment and her reading it lol, unless there is some kind of secret vendetta against me since the discovery of my blog by the teachers... help! Lmao  Ok let's put the topic of teachers and finding blog out of the way now because there have been more things in my day to talk about :)  Anyways I'm off because I've got lots of work to do for school and lunch to do and stuff... bye!
