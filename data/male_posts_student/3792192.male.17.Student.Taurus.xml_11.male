Excelsior - Scaleskin - 2004  22nd July: 2128  It's been a rather long and interesting day. The taxi arrived on time and I was at Southampton Central early, so no problems there. The ride from there to the airport took a few uneventful hours. A few problems in a crowded airport followed, nothing serious, it was dealt with without too much stress. First time flying, well, that was interesting. Within a few seconds of take-off I found myself looking out of the window at miles of countryside. The flight didn't take long though, but it was interesting to feel the forces of the aircraft as it turned and landed. Once we arrived at the Excelsior I was able to see it properly for the first time. There is a nice amount of deck space, and at the stern is a place where I now sit writing this entry.After exploring and deciding on bunks, we had another event, the Crew Parade in Antwerp. Walking through the city holding alarge flag and Excelsior banner, with the crews of other ships as well. It was a rather fun parade, but with the intense heat and sunlight I was glad to finally hand the flag to someone else and get a drink.I have just got back from a crew party over in the hanger, strange, it was much more comfortable outside, the heat and noise inside is not my preference for environment, then again, the food was nice. In the end I decided to return to the Excelsior to take advantage of the peace here.\I can hardly wait until we set sail on Saturday.  -2307 Heh, an interesting end to an interesting day. I stopped reading on deck and moved down to the galley when the others got back from the crew party. We soon realised there was a storm outside and went back up on deck to observe, but had to come back down soon as the steps down to the galley were bad enough without the water. I am now lying in my bunk writing this.  23rd July: 0914  Talk about rough night, the rain meant that we had to shut the hatch, and as a result it became very hot down here, and sleeping in the bunks was harder. The others have just gone for showers, but I can't stand the idea of waiting in those queues for ages.  -1745 Back from a bit of shopping, got some fudge and waffles for the next week, adn right now tea is cooking. It's been rather fun really. I climbed the rigging to take a few photos of the deck, and the good view from near the top of the mast.From one height to another, we went on the ferris wheel of a nearby fair and got a very good view of the larger ships in the race.Spent a while searching for an ATM so we could get some euros out to spend while here and in Denmark, and got back in time for hoistung and lowering the sails, something that will be important tomorrow when we set sail. That was quite interesting, the sails are quite heavy and it is not easy to keep a firm hold on the ropes.Three of us went out to buy some food, and saw a few interesting sights - the cathedral, a fountain which was a relief considering the heat, even though it had started to cool down, And the ship we may go to tonight, the Diamond Princess.  -2136 The party on board the Diamond Princess has now been skipped. There is a party on board the boat next to ours, the Esprit. People have been crossing over the Excelsior to get to it. Crowded boat with beer and stuff, quite nice beer as well. I am trying to avoid drinking too much, only 2 so far. Might go back over there and get another in a few minutes if I can be bothered.Or maybe not, heh, I have just been handed a vodka and coke, and it tastes real nice. Well, heres to a good voyage.  -2240 Right, enough booze! After rejoining the party on the Esprit, I have drunk enough. One more beer or vodka and I probably wouldn't be able to write this. We set sail tomorrow, the sooner the better. Just been another interesting event. Fireworks and lasers. I always liked the effect of laser on smoke. Then again, I guess I'll be glad to set sail and leave. The regular sounding of the foghorns of all the ships could get very annoyed after a while.It's a nice night, quite a comfortable temperature, and will get very quiet once all the parties are over. When I think of it I wonder, am I writing this as a journal entry or in case I can't remember it in the morning?Either way, it's a nice night, clear skies (I wish I could say clear horizons, but we are still in port.) I little stargazing can't hurt.  24th July: 0903  The boats have started leaving, only a matter of time before we head down the river. I am sat here up the mast with a good view of everything whilst writing this. The Excelsior has been cleaned, decks scrubbed, and the Esprit is still being cleaned after the party last night! (Which I can still remember most of).Warm waffles and a cup of tea for breakfast, a perfect start to the day.The Ascard II is just leaving, we have to wait for the Ocean Scout, the Offshore Scout and the Esprit to leave before we can move, then again, I like it up here and once we set sail I can't come up here to write, but on the up side, we won't have people staring at us when at sea. And off goes the Ocean Scout, followed by the Offshore Scout.I think I prefer the Excelsior to these other ships, they were built in the 1990s while the Excelsior is more traditional from 1921.  -1426 I finally left my position up the rigging as the Esprit set sail. We followed up the river on engine power. Water fights between ships are quite funny to watch, Water bombs thrown at us fromthe Sparta,while Nick fired back with the firehose.Well, we have apparentlyleft Belgium and entered the Netherlands. Sails are up and the Excelsior is moving.I have been assigned to a good shift, 0000-0400 and 1200-1600. I guess a semi-nocturnal shift is good, just got to think when I am going to sleep. Not so hot anymore now we are actually moving.  -2136 We are at anchor. I count it as eight times I have hit my head on a door, hatch or the boom. It is much more peaceful here than in dock as we can sit on deck without people staring at us on the ship.One thing I will not forget is to know when to duck if the sails are up, the boom tends to swing quite suddenly.I did a few practise sketches before tea, tea was good, nothing like Stirfry...Anyway, seems our watch has been cancelled tonight. Catch a few ours of sleep before we bring the sails back up.  26th July: 1621  Okay, so I didn't write anything yesterday, I was seasick. Not easy to write when you keep leaning over the sides.Feels awful, dizziness, headaches, and it was worse when below deck, so I spent all day and most of the night up on deck in a sort of semi-concious state since it was too cold to actually sleep.At least today it's not so bad. I am getting used to this motion.Anyway, I don't want to think about yesterday. Today is brilliant. It's a nice temperature, cooled by the breeze, and rather confortable. I can see ships on the horizon, but less often than yesterday. Earlier positions in the race, Excelsior was apparently in 5th place in class, 12th place overall.  28th July: 1403  This mornings watch was amazing. The sky was clear and the stars looked amazing, and the way they reflected on the water. That, a few shooting stars, and the Moonset were inspirational. You could never see anything like that from the city, something you have to come out to see. Even the best artwork could not recall the brilliance of nature. I took photos, but even if they do ome out okay I am in the opinion that they will not show it as well.On a less optimistic note, for the past few days there has been a severe lack of wind, progress is very slow. When we heard that the race could be cut short we discussed the situation. Most of the larger ships may have already dropped out, and now we have retired as well. As I write this, the engines are running. We are going to stop somewhere to resupply and refuel before heading to the  destination port in Aalborg.It seems a shame to have done so well, yet be stopped by the lack of wind, but in order to make it to Denmark in time, it just isn't possible to continue. It has been a great experience no matter how it turns out.I got a chance to control the rudder earlier, makes a change from the computer controls which react to your input without resistance, the boat fights to go its own way and I had to fight with it to remain in control.I'll be glad to get into port though, not that I am not enjoying this, but it has been nearly a week since I last had a shower, use the internet, and various other things.  29th July: 1311  Damn that feels better. We stopped to refuel and were able to get showers. Feels great to actually be clean again for the first time this week. Got to get used to land again, after all this time getting used to the swaying motion of the boat at sea, walking on land makes me feel like I did after the party on the Esprit, swaying when trying to stand still.This mornings watch, now known as the "Graveyard Shift", this time there was high cloud cover so the stars were blocked out. Instead the sea looked interesting, at every movement it glowed and so it was flashing all the way to the horizon.I have no idea if we will sail for a bit then anchor for the night, or simply sail straight to Aalborg. To be quite honest, I don't care. I look forward to our arrival, though we havn't planned a great entry, hopefully not like our departure from Antwerp when a flare was set off and we left a trail of orange smoke.  30th July: 1012  We anchored for the night, so the graveyard shift was cancelled. I went up on deck to look at the stars once again, but quickly became more interested in the full moon, glowing red over the hills on the horizon.It gets rather annoying at times when we end up waiting for a bridge to open so the Excelsior could pass through and continue up the river, but in the end it does save us a bit of time and the river is much calmer than the sea.We should be arriving very soon, a couple of hours if all goes well.The motor boat has been lifted off the deck and is in the water trailing behind us. Also behind us appears to be two other tall ships, but I can't make out the names from this distance.We have cleaned up the interior of the ship, well, sortof, the bunks remain messy but are hidden by the curtains. I ended up polishing the brass clock and the plaque beside it, both of which obviously had not been cleaned for ages.It seems when I think of it, although I miss my computer games, my friends on the internet (particularly those in Halfquake, Misocathlush and NeonDragonArt) I really have enjoyed this whole experience, with the exception of the seasickness. It has been an amazing week which I may never get the opportunity to do again.I have bought some Excelsior merchandise to preserve this memory, but really I think I could never forget it. Anyway, I will be glad to get my feet back on land, maybe find a cybercafe and begin typing this, or, more likely, join in the partying after the race.  1400 We are in Aalborg. There was a bit of confusion as to where the Excelsior was to tie up as the locations had changed.The others have gone to buy supplies. I returned to the Excelsior and searched through the list of activities. There is a party tonight and I think I am going to go for a sightseeing tour tomorrow, see some of the culture of Aalborg.I have the location of the crew centre on the map so I can go and access the internet and type up some of this stuff, check emails, forums..etc.Strange, it seems odd to be away from the internet for so long and really enjoy the sailing.Tomorrow is out last day here, our flight is early on Sunday morning. I am determined to get a look around in the time left.  31st July: 1156  Just went out on a sightseeing tour of Aalborg. The place that interested me the most was the Viking Burial ground. It seemed as if the people running the tour were not interested at all in any of it. I had a good look around the burial grounds and in the museum, quite interested, but we had quite limited time.The crew parade is this afternoon, maybe I'll carry the flag again. Should be fun, well, except for the fact that it is burning hot again just like it was back in Belgium.I have packed my stuff already, no point leaving it in the mess it was in, Tonight we leave the Excelsior and take the flight back to Heathrow. Although I will be glad to get back to Southampton, I have had such a good time sailing.  2015 At the last party I will be going to for this event. Tonight at midnight we leave for the Airport to go back sometime tomorrow morning. I am enjoying the crew party again, the food is not as good this time, but it is okay. The music and dancing makes up for it. May join in the dancing soon, make the most of it while you still can as they say.I didn't do much this afternoon besides the crew parade, which was as much fun, if not more, than the one back in Antwerp. The only people who did not go crazy were a few russian sailors, and the band. The rest of us, well, to list a few, pots and pans, pirate outfits and crazy dances, and even someone with an inflatable orca on his back. The prize-giving ceremony didn't take long. Once back aboard the Excelsior we made sure everything was packed and we were ready toleave quickly tonight.I spent about an hour before the parade up the mast again. I think that particular place instantly became my favourite place on the Excelsior. Up there, while I sit perched on the beam aboethe lights and foghorn I am able to feel every movement of the ship, as well as having a great view of everything. It is quite relaxing to take a book up there, or just to sit and relax.Anyway, this will be my final entry to this journal of the Tall ships experience, so I will just say all I can think of before I forget.Overall I can think of countless experiences I have had along the way. Not only has it been my first time on a tall ship, but I have met people from many other countries, mainly due to the parties, I have spent hours at night just staring at the stars, seeing both Shooting Stars, and the rare Moonset.I have also become quite good at climbing the rigging fast to get to my favourite spot so much (heh). This is the closest I have ever come to being totally isolated from civilisation, and so I have really enjoyed it. It will stand out in my memory as a unique, and one of the best, events of my life so far. If I ever got the chance to board the Excelsior again, I would jump at it. Just to get hold of the tiller and steer the ship out at sea, or to climb back up that mast. It really has been such a great experience, and although there are some amazing ships here, I will never forget the Excelsior. The only negative things I can think of are: (1) Being away from my friends on the internet,and (2) The fact that I was seasick on the first day at sea.As far as internet goes, I have had so much else happening that I didn'tmind the time away that much (no offense to anyone), and although the seasickness was annoying I found it not too hard to adapt and get used to the motion. Besides, it was hard to walk on land afterwards. Some of the Best Things about the Experience:-The night sky at sea: I have never been ableto gaze upon the stars so well, or see a glowing red full moon, and neither of them I could ever see from Southampton, or maybe even the land at all.-Steering the Excelsior: So much better than any computer game controller. The forcesofthe ocean make it all that harder to maintain a steady course, and the tiller resists each and every movement.-Exploring: During this race I have explored both Antwerp (Belgium) and Aalborg (Denmark), and sailed through the Netherlands. Also, the parties have been great, the parades crazy, random and a lot of fun, and thanks to the ships cook, Kirsty, we have been eating great food as well. Although chances areI will never meet most of the people whom I have met here, and I may never see the Excelsior again, let alone set sail on her again as part of the crew, I will never forget the past nine days, it just is not possible to forget such an event in my life.  1st August: 0008  Okay, got caught up in the party while I was writing. I shall end the previous entry with a quick statement. I just took my last look at the Excelsior and the crew, images that will stay in my mind always, the Excelsior, her crew, and the race. I will type this into my blog over the next week.Someof the things I have seen on this journey are so rare that I could never have believed they could exist in the natural world. If the photos come out okay I will post them on a website for you to see, but some things you would have to see to believe it, besides, the camera is not very good for the darker photos. It has been a wonderfully inspiring experience.
