Right now my desk is messy, and there's a lot of random flotsam drifting in my head as well.  School's only a month away, and I'm beginning to feel a bit worried, not about anything specific, but just the kind of obligatory anxiety that tends to accompany the start of a new school year.  I'd like to think that my last academic year wiped clean the slate of past academic failures, but I think I'd rather always have that stain hanging over me, close at hand and always in the corner of my mind, so that the fear of falling back into bad habits can keep me going, if I can't find better motivation at that moment.  I bought a new sword.  Six to eight weeks of waiting.  I hate the waiting most of all.  That, and the inevitable customs fees.  I decided not to get the one that appealed the most to me visually, since, after shipping, the cost of the sword and the apparel would have been close to $1000 Canadian.  Instead I decided on one that is more plain, but of equal quality, saving me around $300.  It seems that whatever problem Azusa's hard drive was having has gone away, and she is functioning as per normal.  Of all the cities in Japan, Kyoto is the one I would like to go to the most for exchange, however, the course selection at Tokyo University seems to be more in line with my interests, history and language, as opposed to Kyoto University's more business and political offerings.  Unfortunately, one of the requirements for Kyoto University's exchange scholarship is that the applicant cannot be under review for any other exchange scholarship, which means I can't apply to both.  For now, however, the course selection for Kyoto University has not been finalized, so it's not an issue yet.  I really like the dots on my weblog.  Don't you?  There's very trendy, yet also high tech in their own way.  I still don't have a Gmail account :(
