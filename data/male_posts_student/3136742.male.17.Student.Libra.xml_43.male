Millions of cicadas were supposed to be occupying single acres. Cicadas coating the ground like picnic blankets, three inches thick on the roads causing a slippery goo to form under tires. When the story hit the news a curious hysteria ensued, as people thought Jesus-Shit, This is gonna be fuckin horrible but pretty damn cool at the same time... You could almost hear the minds of countless boys and young men dreaming up makeshift flamethrowers, some more elaborate than others, but all for the same purpose. You could seriously feel them thining that... Now where are the god damned cicadas I was promised?!!!!
