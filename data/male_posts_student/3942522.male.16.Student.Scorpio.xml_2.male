Well, I am trying hard to reach my ideal height, 180cm. I always think that guys shouldn't be short and that it won't look nice while standing beside your partner if you are.. I learnt some tips to grow taller the fastest way and skipping proves to me the most efficient way.. Everyone knows skipping but do everyone know the secret behind it? Here comesss the tips... When you are jumping, you make sure that your legs are stretched until you feel as though something is pulling your legs.. Remember to do it slowly and not rush.. You will waste all your energy if you do and worst still no improvements at all.. To add on, try to do this constantly everyday and increasing the amount of workout.. I grown 5 cm taller within half a year but I still have to work even harder for my dream.. *Sigh* I have chunks of homework not yet completed.. Gotta go to enjoy a refreshing bath and have my homework done.. See ya ~
