Full-time report:- GERMANY    1-1    NETHERLANDS '34 Frings        '81 van Nistelrooy ::Netherlands played a lot better but kept on trying but the German defence kept on frustrating them. :: Sneijder and Overmars were the sparks after being brought on in the 2nd half. ::Germany played really defensive and it was really hard for the Dutch to break their defence as it was very organised. ::Although the Dutch dominated much possesion in the second half,Germany had a few chances missed by Kuranyi and Ballack etc. ::When it was the last 10 minutes of the game,the Ditch suddenly showed the urgency of need to win the game. ::van der Meyde ran down the right flank and crossed inside the box and i have to admit van Nistelrooy's striker instinct showed as he was under pressure from Nowotny/Worns but managed to hit the ball into the net. ::The Dutch kept on pressurising the Germans until the final whistle was blown but they fail to hit the target.  Conclusion:This is a fair result.It was expected,wasn't it?This will boost the both sides' chances of qualifying although the Czechs  the Latvians should not be underestimated.Their next two games is against the Czechs  the Latvians.I believe that the Germans  the Dutch can beat them both and pregress to the quarter-finals.  _::signin' off:UrCh!n::_
