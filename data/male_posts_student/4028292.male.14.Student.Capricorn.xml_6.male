Every day we would have our daily routine , wake up , eat , water polo , lunch , water polo , dinner , water polo , dorms , and eat chinese food.........The water polo camp was exahusting , i was in the pool for about 7 hours a day swimming , passing , and playing kick ass water polo......I'll have many memories at this camp for example when chase and i snuck into nick grohders (wow that was spelled wrong) dorm and put icey hott all over his speedo.....Good times! I got back to portland at about 6 p.m.........The plane ride was fun it was a 2 hour flight , but there were alot of japanese people there and they seemed confused.....My dad drove chase ,lacey and i home , and we went to red robin..........It got very steamy in that car and that resturant , lacey and i were........spooning haha............well that was malibu and please SOMEONE COMMENT , no one does SO SOMEONE DO IT
