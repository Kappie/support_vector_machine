If you know what I mean, then you know what he meant, and that COMPLETELY SURPISED ME.  And apparently Alex offers his explanation: mralexpants: LOL mralexpants: yeah, i told the getting lost story WrathS 01: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH WrathS 01: WTF WrathS 01: AHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHA  I remember on monday I posted about getting lost in the ghettoes, yeah.  It snowed tuesday, too!  Crazy....  and Andrea and Alex came over and hung out, too.  Great stuff, mmmmm ice cream.  I installed Knights of the Old Republic, too.  I worked yesterday.  And stuff.  Yeah.  Today I worked yet again and met up with Ashley :)  Ash, if you're reading this, you're why I think I'm so lucky.   I plan on KOTOR tonight.
