Okay some babies might look on top of my head when they first meet me but they love it what can i say.  Ria is going to be soooo lucky to have a family like us.  I always say a family need diversity and thats how im going to be.  I cant wait 'til Ria can interact with me so i can make her laugh.  Even if i dont say anything funny she will laugh and make me feel good.  But i always say funny.  Well i will sign again.  PUNJABI FO' LIFE!!!!!
