I mean ...... from baggin on 6th graders to self-realization ..... thats like a total 180.  I should get it something for it's special day. I know what Ima get .. jus ain't gonna do it today. Just wanted to say thank you to my blog for always bein there for me when I had something important to say, or even nothing at all to say. You've helped me spill my guts when I chose not to do so w/ my friends. Thank you =) WUV YA! I'm looking forward to many more years of posts and catharsis.
