Maybe, If I devolop a habbit (haha... habbit hobbit), I'll print it all out and start a written diary for my eyes only, and maybe my wife's if we decide to cuddle up on the couch, by the fire and go through the old diaries. What can I say. I think I'm what they call a die hard romantic. I don't like the sound of that though.  Ok, about yesterday's performance at the Brakefluid E.P. session. I'm thoroughly disappointed at my band's errors. Disappointed, ashamed, distressed, whatever. The mistakes that were made shouldn't have been made. Call it what you want, a learning experience, a first time, a whatever. Whatever.   I'm perfectionist. And I know what I'm capable of and I sure as hell am capable of the best.  What sucks is if the band screws up, it's on me because I'm the frontman. Damn.  I'll make it someday. You just see.  You just wait.
