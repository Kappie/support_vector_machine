I'm finding myself torn between two worlds this semester, and neither of them are that appealing.  On one hand, there is work.  I know the people there, but the environment is simply not conductive to anything resembling happiness, or enjoyment.  On the other hand, school is supposedly an accepting place that takes all kinds.  The problem is, that everybody seems to be the same anyway. Obsessed with image and themselves.  How can somebody feel like they have something unique to contribute when the entire population wouldn't give a fig if you did?  Frustration personified.
