Eventually she just put Reegan on the phone. I guess speaking with her mom scared me off asking her out..She has a really pretty voice...God, I was so nervous, my hands were shaking. I think Ill send it tonight, and then call her tommorow, tell her I sent the tag, and ask her out...I really hope she dosent get freaked out. *counts bakwards from 10*   (5 minutes later)  Ok, I just told ariella, and she is on the warpath. That was a fucking brilliant thing of me to do! *bashes head on keyboard* Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck! Shit!!!!!!!  You know what, I dont care what ariella thinks. I like reegan, and Im going to go with it. post later.
