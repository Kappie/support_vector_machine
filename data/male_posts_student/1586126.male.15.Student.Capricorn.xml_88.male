Its boring, we dont do a thing. We just play nintendo. By the Way, remeber that i never play zelda? well i played it today. I am retarded. I finished the game (big deal), whats retarded is that i finished it, and then i accidentally wrote a new game over the one i had just beat. ARG. about 6 hours of coninuos play, lost. well, at least i can play in pajamas since the beggining of the game. w00t.   I learned how to (i manage to) make a handstand. I also learned how to write without looking. I still look, cuz its easier. But i could write a lot witout making errors.  hallucinogenne. I printed some fotos today too. I went to the supermarket and bought about 80 dollars worth of junk food. neato burrito. I wonder how blogger will be in 10 years. and me too.  Im probably going over to alex on monday.i dont have a spudgun, its at my gramps, one hour form here, so i dont really know what are we going to do all day. Wheres my copy of medieval? hmm....    I want to say i really want you I want to say i really love you But now i know what youve been doing all this time Its sick to think that i once wanted you as mine you disgust me.  And im going to kill you tuesday at 1 am.
