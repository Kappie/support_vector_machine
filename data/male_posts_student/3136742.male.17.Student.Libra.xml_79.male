The rest of the NYC trip: - NYC has the worst waiters in the universe. - NYC is not nearly as hostile and unwelcoming as people make it out to be. Actually, compared to Philly, NYC is for pussies. People were polite, they tried not to get in anyone's way, and kept to themselves. The streets were not scary. Traffic was not bad. And I was very disappointed with the Taxis. They were all new, fancy, and had leather interiors (I wanted the dirty shit I see in movies). - I saw a helluvalot of the city and I don't think there's really much to do there. There's probably more to do in Philly. You start seeing the same stuff over and over. One Armani Exchange per square mile is more than enough. - Cate, the trick to becoming The Ultimate New Yorker is to not try and become anything. As long as you don't walk everywhere with your head tilted towards the sky no one will suspect you as a tourist. The place is so diverse that there is no reall local way of acting. - China Town is filthy and has bad sidewalks. I must've tripped five times. - I think I'd like to live in NYC for a period of less than a decade. - Matt really is as indecisive as I say he is. - Joe is the King of Inconvienience. - on the train ride back some 400+lb, gray bearded, suspender sporting, straw hat wearing, couch potato farmer sat across from me (next to Joe). He said he got on the wrong train and didn't have enough money and was trying to get back to Georgia. He had an unusual gurgle to his voice, he mumbled, and he talked like the indecipherable farmer from  The Water Boy.  He seemed well read though. He commented on  The Crucible , which Matt was reading, and was familiar with the Garrison Keillor book I was reading (and was a listener of  The Prarie Home Companion )... Interesting guy.  - I had a great time and I'd do it again.
