You know you have grown up once you have thought about this.  Now although everyone thinks this, one man acted on it, and hence became an idol. A ambassader, if you will, to the rest of the world, that now represents a little speck of dust known as Australia.  His name, is Steve. Steve bloody Irwin.  Now don't get me wrong, great bloke, done a lot for the wildlife and whatnot. Sure he nearly got his kid eaten, but that little incident can be overlooked. I mean look at all the great stuff he's done. I've been to his zoo, and although I didn't see him, although the lines were ridiculously long and full of tourists, although the poor structure of his zoo outlines the rushed buildings and extensions put forward due to a sudden rise in fame, and although it is just a little bit on the expensive side, it's worth it to see crocodiles being raised away from their natural environment.  I mean seriously, who wouldn't want to be fed in front of a thousand visitors, cheering and taking photos of you? I sure wouldn't mind it. If I had a choice between living in a river, or living in a small pen being looked at all day even when I take a shit, I would take the latter in a second.  Onto the next point. Who the hell talks like Steeve bloody Irwin? Apparently, according to those oh so smart Americans, we all do. And why shouldn't one person represent the way in which a whole country? You know it makes sense. ( I can't imagine you people speaking otherwise- Dammo )  'Crikey! Look at this beauty!'  I got another idea, Steve darling. Shoot yourself in the head, or at least stop talking like a  over crazed orgasming pigmy.  'Have a go at this!'  How about no, friend.  Don't get me started on the movie. The only good thing coming out of that movie was the perve. And no, not on Steve's wife, the other chick. We know a lot of that film was in your park Steve, nice try buddy. The overly used sterotypes were second only to the terrible dialogue, and to top it all off - the ending was as good as my maths ability (which is honestly quite bad) [ Don't forget your English- Dammo ].  I guess you could say I'm not his biggest fan.
