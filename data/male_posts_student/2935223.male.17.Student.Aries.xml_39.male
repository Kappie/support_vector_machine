First, I sepnt the night at Kyle's, then we biked to his dads work* to ask if we can go to the MOA . *He works at the University, it wasn't that far Then when we got home I was freakin' out because I remembered that I had an orthodontist appointment to go to, so I was trying to figure out how to fit everything into one day. 2.)Wrote in my blog 3.)Went to the MOA...it was pretty kool, got to laugh a lot and hang out with my best buds  BEST QUOTE IN THE WORLD at the moment: "Merry Christmas, your skin is gone." 4.)Skipped my ortho appointment because there wasn't enough time for it and MOA and stuff. 5.)Got home and stayed around for like 10 minutes(in which I called Lauren and found out I was supposed to go to her house.) 6.) Went to Laurens house and stayed for like 25 minutes, then had to go back home so that my dad could ahve the car....but he drove me down to Lauren's...so it was all good. When I got there the second time, everyone was inside, and I just followed John inside and to the basement and stuff...it was kool. Sat down and watched One Tree Hill, got to watch sum Cheerleaders...which reminded me of the conversation I had with Brittany(read it here: http://www.livejournal.com/users/cosmicastaway_/ ) Then we watched 2Fast 2Furious...it was pretty good, but I must admit that I didn't pay much attention to the second half.  I was too busy being by Keli...god that rocked. Seriously, I never thought that holding hands could be that kool...BUT IT WAS!!! I really like her, and she really likes me, and I'm gonna miss her really bad when she's in Japan, but the fact that she is gonna be having the time of her life makes it a little better.  Hopefully she'll remember me and won't go and find sum really awesome Japanese guy who is a billion times kooler than I am.(which isn't that hard) Then everyone left and I got a ride home with Keli, and we held hands the whole way back, and that was kool too...I never thought about showing any signs of affection in front of grown-ups...but we held hands the whole way.....it was nice.  Then when I got out of the car, I got a big hug from Keli, and that was UBER nice...I like hugs from Keli....they're so....I dunno...they are just really awesome.  Then I went inside and got to try and go on the internet...but my dad has F***ED up the computer too bad for it to work sumtimes.....it really sux.  ***TODAY*** I called Kyle and Steve while I was in the bathtub...that was funny :-P  I was too lazy to get out.  Then they came over, and I was still in the bath when Steve got there, so he just drove around his go-kart for a while, and I got to ride with him when I went outside.  Then Steve, Kyle, Ervin, Conor, Glennie, and I sat down and watched the Linkin Park DVD that Ervin got yesterday, it was rock-awesome.  Then Ervin had to leave for work, and Kyle took him home and never came back, because apparently he didn't wanna watch Matrix Revolutions that bad.  So Steve, Conor, Glennie, and I watched Matrix together...and man that movie rox!  Then I took them home, and on the way back I drove like a maniac and almost flipped my car, and Steve and I almost died...that was fun.  It was scary as hell, and then when I opened the door to the house, my dad opened the door and hopped out and yelled...so I think I pissed my pants.  Then I ate dinner and packed up my stuff to spend the night at Steve's...which leaves me here. HOLY CRAP THAT WAS A LOT OF TYPING!!!  Alright, I think I'm done for now.  Keli, if you read this, I still love you, and already miss you hardcore. Peace!  Spense
