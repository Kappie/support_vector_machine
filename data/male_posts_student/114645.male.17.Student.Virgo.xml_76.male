My schedule is as follows:  1)     Office Aide 2)     French II Honors 3)     Aerospace I (Ground School) 4)     American Literature 5)     US History Honors 6)     Algebra II Honors 7)     Physics I  What a load eh? I know, I can't believe it. I have 3 honors classes. I only have one class that isn't that hard, and it is Office Aide, and my parents want to take that away from me, but it is early bird, and not very many teachers teach early bird so.........I dunno. But yea. I'm tired as hell. I start my early bird class tomorrow. I hope all goes well, being that I am in the Deans Office. :-| What am I to expect from the Deans Office? Am I to face the infamous Rancho gang members? Hell no. It is early bird Student Aide. What is the worse that happens? Well, anywayz. I'm tired as hell and the Broncos are loosing, so I'm gonna go. Hopefully the Broncos will get lucky and win.
