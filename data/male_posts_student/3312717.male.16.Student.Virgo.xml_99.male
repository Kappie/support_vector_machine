If I was him, I'd probably choose Pammy, because me and Chris aren't exactly genial company. If Chris embarrasses you, fine. But you probably shouldn't be going out with Pammy if you are scared of her seeing your friends. It's not like she is going to judge you by him, anyway.   Why do I care about what people listen to? This is a hard question. Basically, I believe the music we listen to reflects who we are. Music is more important to me than most people. I know this is general, but I don't want to get into the whole punk argument again so I'll just let it be, and keep my music to myself from now on.  John: to vow to be a better friend is a noble resolve. I too, will make a vow. I will be a bigger jerk to my friends. Uh, I can't explain it. I just like to be a jerk to you guys.  I gotta bring my car to the shop tomorrow.   I got my pictures developed today, and most of them turned out quite well. I probably only used about half of the pictures I took, though.  I have been hanging out with Chris and Bryce a lot lately. Chris is no surprise, because we hang out virtually every day anyway, but I haven't done anything with Bryce really forever. He is like my slacker-replacement friend who is never busy, along with the Oselands. John and Houley and Hobe are always so busy these days. You guys need to take it easy.  I hope it is nice out tomorrow, so I can go to the beach. I haven't been to the beach all summer, and I know a really nice one that no one ever goes to.   I've started a fashion revolution, and it is getting out of hand. At first I wanted some stuff that was original, and now people are ripping off my clothes left and right. I got this really awesome Joe Strummer T-shirt, and if I see anyone else wearing one like it I am going to punch them in the face.  Speaking of Strummer, I got  London Calling  in the mail the other day, and it rocks. It reminds me that music is a force of change, and hearing something that still sounds new, exciting, and dangerous after 24 years gives me a lot of hope for the future. Sometimes it feels like everything is stagnant, that nothing under the sun is new, to use a cliche. Music brings us to new places and new people. Who hasn't been changed by music? In some cases it is only slight, like connecing an emotion or memory to a certain song. In some cases, music deeply changes you, influencing you on the outside as well as the inside.    So, I guess I am the new general of the Casualties Army, seeing as Erik sold himself out for a chance at a girlfriend, and Jorge (aka Chris) has none of the skills involved in running a massive army of asshole elitests.   Me/Chris/Bryce drove around today, much like we did yesterday. Tomorrow we actually have a plan, i.e. go to the beach if it is nice or even passable out. I'll probably give everyone a ring before we go, but I doubt anyone will want to/be able to come with other than us, and maybe Dustin and Erik.  I have eaten no solid food yet today, only coffee products. Black coffee, then frozen at the DQ, then frozen again at Caribou. It felt kind of nice at first but now I feel like throwing up.  I don't really have anything to blog about today. We should talk about something, but it shouldn't be about politics or religion. To have to actually use my brain during a discussion in the summer would be the worst kind of blasphemy. No, just kidding. Houle or John or someone start it, please?   P.S: Anyone care to speculate on H+C? (no names!)
