My expectations weren't that high.  The two hours flew by.  There's nothing huge here, no wonderful effects, no Big Moments that will Alter My Life.  It was just a fun, entertaining, well written, wonderfully filmed piece of work, even for an $8 million dollar budget.   urlLink The Mojo  reveals the film made $82 million on $15 million in expenses.  That made me happy, because it deserves to make some cash.  28 Days was directed by the guy who directed Trainspotting (which is another great film), and his use of digital video was a great choice for this particular story.  It has a grittiness that works well for the subject material.  The DVD includes two alternate endings, plus one radical alternate ending that changes the movie from the halfway point.  The radical ending is told with storyboards and dialogue, similar to one of the alternate endings on the Se7en DVD.  For once, the primary ending, despite being upbeat, was perfect for the tone of the film.  If you know anything about me, I love films that give you a good swift kick on the nether regions on the way out, but in this case, I liked it better with the 'happy' conclusion.  Call me soft, but it worked well here.  No, it isn't a typical Elite Bastard film.  It isn't the archetype of all films of this genre, and it won't whiten your teeth...but I really enjoyed it despite being skeptical.  Give it a view, and watch the different endings.
