I'm conscious of the on coming consequences  results. Knowing flowers blossomed will someday die but still chose to pursue my love wholeheartedly. People think that love do not need to be voice out and we can feel it. To a certain extent i agreed, as we can feel the love enveloping us. But still without your acknowledgement, i felt insecure. Just because my understanding of human's complexitivity... Knowing smoking can kills but people still do it... The disappointment is deadly. But i can do nothing. Who can gives me an answer? To question myself not wanting to wait aimlessly. What if there is no answer? Who dares to question the atrocities of life? Who can ever tells me the brink of love is man made or by natural? The answer is to experience by yourself, only this can nurture your behaviour towards life.
