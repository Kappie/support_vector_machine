All you need is the free Shockwave Player, and you're ready to go. urlLink     I’ve gone to Shockwave for just about anything for several years now.  They’ve got the best games, the best downloads...practically, the best anything.  They have an assortment of crazy cartoons and games, and it’s a lot of fun.  One of the best features of Shockwave.com is the amount of games.  There are just so many, that it would take forever to play.  They have games based on big franchises, such as the new Shrek Bowling game, and also, the new Collapse Crunch.  The games are awesome, and they are what really set Shockwave.com apart from the rest of the internet scene.  Not to mention, the games look great with the required WildTangent driver.  They really are incredible, and anyone who likes webgames needs to check this one out.  They have a sub-site called “AtomFilms,” which has got some of the best web cartoons and other videos on it.  Some of the funniest include the Angry kid series, which has been one of my favorites since a few years back.  They’ve now started “Angry Kid Series 2,” which is highly hilarious, and definitely something you don’t want to miss out on.  So, with all the games and videos and things that Shockwave offers, it is one of the most entertaining sites around.  You have to download Shockwave in order to view it, but, let me tell you, its definitely worth it.  I give Shockwave.com an impossible, irresistable  6 out of 5.
