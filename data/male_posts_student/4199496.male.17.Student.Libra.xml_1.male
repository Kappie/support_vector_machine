I've been writing in one pretty faithfully for the past three years, since the start of high school, but for some reason recently I've had this gut instinct to give it up and start a new one.  Maybe my subconscious is telling me it's ready to start a new chapter in life, and that it doesn't want the undercurrent from the past dragging me down.  Does that make any sense?  Is that weak of me?  Both are questions I hope to answer some day...  I'll continue to write, because I need to write.  It's helpful and I enjoy it.  So that's why I'm here.  My friend Thomas has a BlogSpot journal and it looked pretty, and I'm attracted to pretty things.  Yep.  Aesthetically pleasing is always a plus in my book.  So is being easy to use - which so far BlogSpot seems to be as well.  So, here we go.  I'm off on a new journey, recording it in a new journal, and standing at the threshold of a new portion of my life!  Stay tuned, this is about to get real exciting...
