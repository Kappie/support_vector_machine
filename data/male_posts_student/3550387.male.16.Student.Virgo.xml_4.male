In addition, after she hanged up, I keep doubting whether she missed me or just called to please me. I ponder if she feels anything when I said "I love you" to her  Well nvm about that, I think thoroughly that if she doesn't miss me, she won't have called me :P furthermore, I am sure she is very happy upon hearing thoese 3 words :D Sorry for my sensitivenss just now lao po, I guess I miss you badly, and I think that's the cause of it..  Also, I am sad because she hasn't sms me from 5pm till 8.15pm(now).. haiz but no worries! I will cheer up myself and wait for your sms no matter what! I love you sweetheart! Ok Another 2 days+- or 48hrs+- or 2880mins+- or 172800sec+- or 1day12hrs360mins21600secs+- to your welcome back! I did all the calculations mentally dear! I love you! come back soon !!
