Kalai sat in front of me ... sue came late and sat beside me .. phew, good to have a friend sit beside you .. Julian as usual was walking around looking at our answers, and making funny faces, etc.... anywayz, studied till late on 8 Aug morning, chatted with noormie, kalai, melly, josh in betwee... it feels great to have nice classmates, kinda motivates me in my studies .. was buzy buzy at work again as usual .. went to watch The Village (a little disappointed but shall not unveil for the sake of those who have yet to watch) .. went shopping on Mon with my sis and the two lil ones .. i lurve them so much .. can't imagine life without them though!!! bought some clothes .. went back to office today after being off from last Thurs, got 1001 emails to go thru plus preparations for a senior management meeting, but crazy me, it feels really good to be back at work, i actually missed going to work coz i have got a few really fantastic colleagues .. i am trying to study but hubby has his friends over playing jim ruby with tiles so i kept tok tok with them ... read melly's and sue's blogs, glad they enjoyed their nite out (minus Russ for melly maybe?) and that dear sue's in lurve ...
