The CD of which I speak is a compilation of songs from Canadian Progressive Supergroup (and one of my personal favorites) , Rush. The compilation entitled "The Spirit of Radio: Greatest Hits 1974-1987" is a 16 track piece of Rush's first 13 years of existence in the popular music scene. It is a great buy, especially considering that it came with a DVD containing the music video for Tom Sawyer, Closer to the Heart, and a third song that I forgot. (Apparently, I haven't been watching that particular DVD.)   There is a funny story behind my purchase of this CD. It was my very first Rush CD (my first legitimate one anyway, because my first Rush CD was a compilation CD that my younger brother was kind enough to burn for me before I left for Manchester, NH after Christmas break) . I've known the band Rush for the longest time, and I have always known them to be a solid rock band. I was a fan of the band since I was a young man (by that, I mean grade school because I am still very much a young man). All this time listening to Rush, all I had were a few of their albums on cassette format, which will not stand the test of time because I constantly wear them out. So that summer, I decided to get it in CD format but, instead of getting one of Rush's twenty-somewhat studio albums, I decided to get a compilation... for now. I did so, and what I got was this CD. I listened to it non-stop until the fall and early winter. This is when I decided that I wanted all of Rush's work, so I started to buy all of their work, and the rest as they say, is history.  Twenty-six CDs later (27, after "Feedback" comes out on June 29), I have completed my Rush CD collection. It would have been totally complete if I could find the "Archives" 3-LP vinyl collection. Unfortunately, I do not listen to records and "Archives" has been discontinued, along with the fact that "Archives" is just a re-release of Rush's first three records (which I already have on CD) it makes "Archives" unimportant in my collection of the Rush catalogue (but it would be nice to have). Now that I have established myself as the biggest Rush fan in Asia, I feel that I am qualified to write about the CD that I speak of, "The Spirit of Radio: Greatest Hits 1974-1987".   As great a compilation as this CD is, I feel it is not as comprehensive as the other Rush compilation albums. Given the fact that it only encompasses one or two stylistic eras of Rush's now 30-year career (30th anniversary tour. YEAH!), it still isn't a complete summary of Rush's first 13 years. There were songs from older albums that I feel shoud have made into this CD, such as "By-tor and the Snow Dog" from 1975's "Fly by Night" album. Upon listening to the CD, I also feel that "Mission" from their 1987 album "Hold Your Fire", among others should have been included. Other than that, this would be a good compilation. It isn't as thorough as the other compilations (because it doesn't span the last 17 years of Rush's career), but it does have a lot of old favorites like "A Farewell to Kings'" "Closer to the Heart", and the big three from the "Moving Pictures" album, "Limelight", "Tom Sawyer", and "Red Barchetta". Included as the last track on the CD is "Time Stand Still" from "Hold Your Fire" (a personal favorite of my dear younger brother's), which is a powerful song about, of all things, growing old.   In general, this CD is not a complete representation of Rush's work in this 13-year span, but it is still a good CD with 16 fully solid tracks covered with prog rock goodness from the Canadian supergroup. It is still a great buy for many Rush fans or people who would like to get to know this band better, but if you want to get to know the band better than this CD will allow you to, just get all their other CDs. The price for this collection is steep, but it is so worth it. Better yet, catch Rush in a town near you (in the US, Canada, and Europe only) as they are currently on their 30th anniversary tour. I know I will (look out Los Angeles, California! Here I come!), or you can check their website at www.rush.com! You won't be disappointed that you discovered them (unless you're not into that kind of stuff).
