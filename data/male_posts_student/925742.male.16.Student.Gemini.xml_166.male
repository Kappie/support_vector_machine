Working behind our backs.  Her take is that AOL IM direct connection physically connects wires between your computer and theirs.  Her take is that MCI is trying to steal our DSL away from us.  Her take is that she is a *hacker*.  And much, much more nonsense!  She seems to have misconstrued statements from Derek and I and "learned" a lot from AOL IM.  In the chat rooms.  Yes, apparently, she's getting quite good at it!  At what, chatting?  Or what I'm afraid *it* actually is.  Also, she claims to have worked with Linux, and Open Source Code!  It's sad.    ARGH.
