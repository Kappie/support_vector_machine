Cause my dear always very the impatient one...if dont answer the phone in time she would be very very angry.......sooooo happy my darling called me! Decided to pamper her with a movie. Thou i dont really like horror films as I am also a scardy cat but I decided I shall pamper her with her fav type of movie today. The movie is named "Sisters" n is supposely based on a true incident in thailand. Wonder if it would scare her into hiding her face into her hands n me closing my eyes shut or not....like the last horror movie we watched. Ooops must hurry go book tix n call my darlin back. Rainy day....such nice weather to sleep. Oooooo one week more to my birthday.     Quote for the day: Love is an extension of oneself, affecting everyone around us.
