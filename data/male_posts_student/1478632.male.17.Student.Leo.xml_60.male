Got a Gmail Account last week. jake.gallagher@gmail.com if you feel like emailing me there. Yesterday we went up to the lake and played DDR at the arcade and then went to another, bigger arcade and played there. After that we went to the beach and played around in some kayaks. Quite an eventful weekend. Right now, I'm playing "The Sex Game" with Genia. She seems to like it. It's one of those This or That kind of games...You can probably get the rest. Tomorrow is when parking stickers get on sale at school. Seth is coming over early and we're heading up there to purchase them. Yay. Later, all.
