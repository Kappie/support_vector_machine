We (Me and some other peoples) are working on some new maps to do some amical tournaments on private games. If at least 6 people are in, it will be done. It's gonna be called "Leagues". I worked on some blue prints with  Wanderley  this morning, and we came up with 3 cool maps. I will mod them and compile them after school, and probably publish them on my ftp.   I will also put all the results in assignated posts on this blog. If it works, it's gonna be crazy!  Regards,  Zephyr
