Although generally  urlLink lambasted by the critics , I believe it is a solid film, although I can't help but wonderabout its potential for greatness that remained unattained. More on that later.  urlLink Clive Owen turned in a decent performance as Arthur, showing appropriate anger via mostly mouth-acting. The camera cut away every moment I thought he was going to fall short. Nice work  urlLink Antoine ! Speaking of camera work, DP  urlLink Slawomir Idziak did a slick job, and the editing was also solid. One scene in particular deserves mention: the semi-climactic duel between Owen and  urlLink Stellan Skarsgard . While not as monumental as  urlLink Maximus v. Commodus due to fairly weak character development, I appreciate the way the battle was shot and edited. I firmly believe that in any hand-to-hand combat scene, fewer cuts make for a more intense experience, and that theory was utilized here to some extent. Of course, there have to be at least a few cuts for respite's sake, but too many seem todisorient the viewer.  The filmhad an entertaining plotline, but I felt that the characters could have been developed a little better. Andthis leads me tothatunachieved greatness I mentioned earlier. In the film,Arthur plays aChristian who is doctrinally a Palagius-follower. For those not keen on their 3rd-4th centurychurch history, :) Palagius taught that man has free will to chooseGod, rather than thepredestination doctrine that most churches have accepted over time.Sotheunderlying message of the film turns out to be an interesting question of what happens when men (particularly Arthur'sknights, who gain freedom from the Roman Legion), have the ability to choose duty rather than being forced into it. However, throughout the story, Arthur's faith is challenged by his pagan cohorts and other professing believers who commit atrocities. All the while I was thinking and hoping that the current of theplot was going to be a test of Arthur's faith, and a triumph of his perseverance despitethe opposition to his devotion to Christ.But in the end, this route is not directly addressed, but insteadthe movie takesthe free will/duty option as the main message. And yet, perhaps the question of his faithwas answered, albeit not verbally. It may be that Arthur's premarital bedroom exploits (implied), and eventual marriage to a pagan woman ( urlLink Keira Knightley ) indicate his faith didn't direct his life as much as we thought it did. Too bad. Had the film more directly and positively explored this aspect, it just may have become a classic. 7/10   Also at the drive-in, I had the unpleasant experience of suffering through  urlLink  Dodgeball  . With only one genuinely funny moment, this movie is not only stupid, but repulsive. Stay far, far away. 2/10
