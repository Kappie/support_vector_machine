I wish it would be a little faster to get free webspace with no ads...  I wonder if they'll accept me.  I sure hope so.  Lets see we had our church dance/lock-in on fri.  Reid and Laura and I played with the balloons during the dance (nobody was dancing) cuz the music was lacking severely.  Actually it was more that there wasn't enough music.  I must have heard 10 of the songs at least twice.... thats not a good thing considering if i had a converter i coulda played 2 and a half days of music with no repeats off fernando (he's my iPod if you didn't know, which you probably didn't).  Then the lock in started, it was fun, but i think the last one was a tad better.  The same stuff happened pretty much, people played halo, we played where-is-this-in-the-church, had talks in the little side hallways in half-darkness, sat in the dark and watched people walk by lacking even a slight knowledge of us/me, sometimes scaring people, and sleeping on the pews (this time in the choir room).  The only diff was that we couldnt go in the sanctuary/nave this time.  lying under a pew waiting to scare people reminded me of a dream I had once.  I was in wal-mart (or maybe it was target) and for some reason, they were searching for me, as well as some of my friends (in the dream they were my friends, i never dream about my real friends) so i went in this room in the back, and we hid, and then i found this little hole that was about the shape of the space where i was under the pew.  And then it sortof turned into the shawshank redemption, we started digging and just before we escaped I woke up.  Now back to the lock in from that segu.  I had a headache for part of the night so that wasnt so fun, as well as an ache of my mind which i've had for a little while now.  And no, I'm not telling you about that one, unless I feel like it, so theres no point to asking.  we had confirmation after the lockin, we had to go to sleep at 3 and i (surprisingly) didn't wake up until 8, confirmation started at 9 and it was SOOO boring.  We talked about prayer the whole time and i doodled some stuff.  And we ate thea's starbursts and folded the wrappers for a necklace (for mary i think) and then we went home and i took a shower and alex called me and asked if i wanted to come over at 7 until 11 and i'm like "I was up late last night ya know" and he's like "I know" and I'm like "ok" It was funny, and typical of us at the same time.  So I went to sleep and woke up at 5:30 and alex came at 6:50 and we had a great time.  Playing vintage pinball and poker (nick you lucky little....) and the usual and my parents wouldnt let me stay overnight. :(  And we went to Zion United Methodist today for SS and it was ok but not the best.  Well.  I think that we're finnally done.  Isn't that peachyful?  I gotta scan something for my mum now.  Later.
