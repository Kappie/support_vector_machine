Talk with your doctor; it could save your life."  Ragin' Ron Ferguson IM's me to let me know that the above underwriter's announcement (which I just read) sounds as if it's saying that men, along with heart disease, is the number one killer of women.  And he's right, it does come to think of it. Now switch it around, and you'd really be on to something.
