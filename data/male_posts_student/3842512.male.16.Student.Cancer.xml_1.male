As I have said, I will periodically post his opinions and beliefs when they reflect those of mine. This is truely a great opinionated blog posting. It is my great honor and privilege to present to you: Democrats Amaze Me.    Democrats Amaze Me   ...really, they do. As most of you reading this know, I've largely stayed away from political debate since I graduated high school. It's not that I'm any less of a conservative Republican than I used to be, nor that I no longer take an interest in politics. It's simply that I have other things to discuss with my friends, and on this blog, etc., so I spend most of my time worrying about other things. Sometimes though, something comes up that I just have to comment on, and that's what this post is about. Before I start though, my apologies to any of my friends reading this who are Democrats, or Greens, or any other type of the liberal political persuasion. What follows is not a personal attack on you, but more of an honest question in a friendly spirit of debate about what exactly Democrats see in their party.  The item in question is the "Universal National Service Act of 2003", introduced to the House as HR. 163 and to the Senate as S. 89 in January of last year. This bill is the much-discussed reinstatement of a national military draft. Specifically, to paraphrase the press release I've linked to below, it proposes making two years of military or other national defense service mandatory for all U.S. citizens or permanent residents between the ages of 18 and 26 (and please note that says 'citizens', not 'males'...it amends draft legislation to officially include females for the first time). Now, who would propose such a thing...could it be President Bush, or Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld? Surely they'd be the first to jump on such a thing, warmongers as they are. Am I right Democrats, you olive branch-bearing bringers of peace?  Wrong. Totally and utterly wrong. The legislation was introduced to both the House and Senate by Democrats (Rep. Charles Rangel [D-N.Y.] and Sen. Fritz Hollings [D-S.C] respectively). Furthermore, of thirteen co-sponsors of the House bill, every last one is a Democrat... and the Senate bill doesn't even have any co-sponsors at all. If you don't believe me, feel free to check it out for yourself, I've provided a few links at the end of the post to help you out.  So Democrats, who cares to explain? If President Bush is the evil force who wants to send people our age to war against their will, as you have portrayed him to be...why isn't a single Republican backing this new draft? Could it be because it's unneeded? Not only unneeded but, in my ever so humble opinion, ineffective as well. If you make military service compulsory, you get a military full of people who don't want to be there and thus probably won't fight as effectively as volunteers would. Oh, and if you finish answering that question before time is called, I have a follow-up: did you happen to catch the part of the bill where drafting can be deferred for high school education only, and only until age 20? College students need not apply, they need only go to war if they're drafted. Democrats accuse the Bush administration of allegedly using the Patriot Act to chill academic research in some fringe cases, but see no problem with a gigantic and direct slap-in-the-face to higher education like this bill provides. Unbelievable.  And there you have it...the latest example of why Democrats never cease to amaze me. Please, if any Democrats (or Republicans) want to comment on this, I'd love to hear from you...the comment link is right down there at the bottom. Oh, and speaking of links, the research ones I promised you in case you'd like to follow up on this:  -Frank  Bill Summary and Status for HR. 163: http://www.congress.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:HR00163:@@@L=m Press Release from the office of Sen. Fritz Hollings: http://hollings.senate.gov/~hollings/materials/2003127636.html  P.S. Yes Democrats, this is *exactly* the sort of reason I will still vote for Bush this fall, despite your best efforts to convince me otherwise.
