Like a lot of quilt projects, cutting out all the pieces correctly at the beginning is a key part. My favorite part was adding the ruffle. I think it really gives the quilt a finished look and makes the wrong side just as nice as the "raggy" side.  Yesterday I received the latest gooseberry patch catalog in the mail. On page 43 there is a rag quilt similar to the one I made. (although I am not sure it is flannel). The price in the catalog is $125!! (and I don't think it has the added ruffle.) The quilt does take about 8 yards of fabric and nice flannel can be $8-$9 per yard. I ws able to get the flannel for the quilt on sale at Beverly's in San Luis Obispo.  urlLink http://www.gooseberrypatch.com   urlLink
