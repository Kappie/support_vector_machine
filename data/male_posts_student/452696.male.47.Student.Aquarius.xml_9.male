Takes a great deal of work to capture an image, a feeling, a shape or a moment. Good instructor and lots of interesting people in the class. Lots of interesting works developing both good and not so good in the students. My goal is nothing more than to improve my drawing skill and the way I look at things I draw, so as to describe them better using dfferent mediums, like graphite, charcoal, conte', pen and ink etc. Messy business, but I love it :-)  I'm turning 46 this Tuesady (February 11) and still on the retirement trail. I'm going to be making significantly less, but I think physically and mentally I can't continue working in my current environment. I'm starting to feel the lack of direction, decision and support more and more. I'm also feeling cut out of the overall decision making process for the direction of e-learning. I don't think I'm imagining it, 'cause other people have also noted we suffer a surreal chasing our own tails kinda business model.
