Somehow I managed to sleep till 2:15pm today which is a mystery to me as I wasnt particularly tired the night before. So as I am writing this at 3:45pm, I am still under the "just woken up" condition where you just feel really....bleh. I'm sure you know what I mean.  Once again I have no idea what to do with myself, I must bring myself to do 3 things; write a letter to emma, write a letter to phil and get together with Ricky. Hmm. It's funny really, you get all excited about a hugely long holiday off school, but then you realise theres actually nothing to do to pass the time. Apart from just sit here saying to whoever is on msn that I'm bored. Then going back to being bored of course.  At least peter will be back from holiday soon so I can terrorize his house. And of course next weekend theres Twiggies to go round and go to church, that'll be good I really need to go to church.   I hate staring around my room. It's just mess in the most annoying places, but I've tried tidying it up. Within a day, sometimes even mere minutes, things get put back into the empty spaces again, and the mess has returned. It's a never ending pointless cycle and so I now just don't bother to tidy up the mess in the first place. Makes sense don't you think? Well probably not coming from me.  Now I shall go back to boredom and waiting for emma to call.......
