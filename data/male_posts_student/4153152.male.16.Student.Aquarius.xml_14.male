If you follow the  urlLink DC Resource  link on the left and pick up the Navy SEALs movie, you'll notice similarities between this movie and theirs. I like what they've done and picked up some ideas from the way DCR did their movie. Same premise-a few guys shooting a bunch of other guys. I'm shooting for the end of the month as the release date for this movie. I think I'll bite the bullet and upload it to FilePlanet this time. Ugh. That will take hours.  Beyond that, work is keeping my busy most of the time. Just as things begin to quiet down, they pick back up again. No fun there. I swear, the next person who wants me to figure out what is wrong with his computer and tell him how to fix it over the phone is going to get...I don't know but it will be, but it will be A)painful and B)ah hell, I don't know. I'm going to bed.
