I feel sad... like i have one of those personal rain clouds following me everywhere...  Martha and I are both in a mess...  I'm having a mental breakdown... I don't want high school.... my youth, innocence, my childhood... to leave me...  I don't want to grow up....  i need a hug, a kiss, and a big laugh.
