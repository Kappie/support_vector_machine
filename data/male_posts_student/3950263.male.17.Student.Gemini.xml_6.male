BTW: Ill have some art work for these characters in a few days,  I have to go around school, and an ROP class... so... yeah...  anyways, the main characters of Empty Space are:  Me (w00tness) Ryan Jeff Kevin Shinji Trevor  The secondary characters of Empty Space are still being decided on, but  here is the list so far:  Cameron Justin Thomas Phil  Thats it, the only reason that last names weren't included is for  security reasons, and since if you think you know who is in the comic,  you would already know.  Now, the main characters of Alternate Space:  Jynx (w00tness, lol) Crazy Ryan Fluffy Rage (name in the worx) Mr. Monotone Roadkill  These characters are listed in the same order as the above list, they  are all the 'alter egoes' of the above listed ones...  Secondary Characters:  Twitch (name in worx) (name in worx) (name in worx)  These are all the characters that we have come up with for the comic so  far, any suggestions for personality, or artistic look are great,  please post them, or comment on this post, thanx xP
