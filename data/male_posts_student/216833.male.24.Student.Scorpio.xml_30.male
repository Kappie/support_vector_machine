Robert, my co-worker, is taking a vactions this week.  So its me and James on duty.  Hopefully it will be light.  The weekend was beautiful.  Very nice outside the whole weekend, it might have been a little to windy yesterday, no problem.  I made a decision sunday to take my kitty to the SPCA - I feel alot better.  After that trip, I did some studying for about an hour and 1/2 and went to check my email and message boards.  Alex was online, after his 18 hours of sleep, and said we should go pass out some MELANGE flyers. I headed straight over to their apartment and soon after that we treked around dallas putting up flyer.  Where will we go next.  There is that FW, 2/3s of the name, that we need to tackle as well.  Our "west-side connection" has failed us.  We had little trouble putting up flyers.   There is always that one asshole guy, and he works at the Magnolia so spit on him if you see him!   FUCK YUPPIES, cuz they are the people who think beauty is clean!  I like clean, I hope I'm not a yuppie.  I'm hip yo!
