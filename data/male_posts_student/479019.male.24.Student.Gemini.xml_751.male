Art History 550E: 10/10 (Dec. 15)  Art History 572F: 17/17 (Dec. 10)  Sociology 607: 12/18 (Dec. 16)  Sociology 616: 14/20 (Dec. 11)  Totals: 53 / 65 = 81.5%  Remaining: 12 pages / approx. 10 days = 1.5 per day ~ with some buffer   Can I get it done!?  So like last night I was convinced that learning Japanese would be a useful thing... let's just say I luckily had a translator translate an important "offer" from a certain someone.   This morning I got up early and went to the insurance company with Inhye to help her with her car insurance stuff. Then I returned  Ferris Bueller , did my laundry, mailed stuff on campus, and got some writing done.  Man I had a large dinner... I had a huge chicken burrito, a turkey sandwich, and fries... then took a nice long nap. Naps rule!  New  Offspring  comes out tomorrow!  ***
