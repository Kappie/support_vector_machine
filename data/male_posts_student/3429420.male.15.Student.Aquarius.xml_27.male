I left my dreams and hopes As the light shimmer of memories To a new land, I am there  Smashing the mirror,  I knew there was no way back Ruins of past and present lay before me Am i to find the one who i love and who love me not, in the midst of the sunless lands?  Where the wind seems an absent vacuum And the air tainted with death My home? I do not know There seems not a presence of a smoke nor shadow AS i tread lifeless waste I found a charcoal sheet Upon it wrote " July 2 Year 3210 "
