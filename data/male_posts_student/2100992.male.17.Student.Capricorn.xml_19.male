We didn't do much work in any of my first two classes. School is winding down and slowly things are getting easier. Then Thursday at lunch my entire biology class went to The Mandarin for lunch, and it was freakin awesome. Best lunch ever, no lie. Friday wasn't really anything big. I presented my biology i.s.u. (independant study unit) and I got a 90% so that was good.  Saturday was the first golf day of the year, and as The Triad calls it the "Tee Off Invitation 2004." Me and Dave were the co-defending champions going on, as we tied last year in the opening round. This year, we went into the final hole tied yet again, and I ended up beating Dave by 1 stoke. Champ 2 years in a row! lol  Saturday night, Me and Dave went to our friend Stephs house with Vince, and Allison, and we played Balderdash. I totally forgot how awesome that game really is. The funniest response of the night had to go to Vince with "started the first national yacth club" and "Humping Horis' Ape" ... then before we were done playing Megan showed up too and then we watched Dickie Roberts. It was the first time I had ever seen that movie and it was pretty funny, but it seemed kind of predictable throughout the movie as to what was going to happen. Then when the movie was done Allison drove us all home. So Saturday was indeed a wicked day all around.  And today, well it's pretty much just been a relaxing day. I played some Fight Night 2004 (seriously the best boxing game ever) and then I ate lunch, and now im watching the Calgary Flames vs San Jose Sharks game 4 of the Western Conference Finals. And right now its 4-1 and looks like San Jose is going to win this game and tie the series.  Well im outta here ... lets hope the school week goes by rather quickly as next weekend is  MAY 2-4!  which means the carnival is right beside my house and Sunday night is fireworks.
