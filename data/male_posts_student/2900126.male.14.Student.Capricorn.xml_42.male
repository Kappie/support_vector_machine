But still Chichi is coming back in like the beginning of August (agosto), I think. Last night Chichi and I were remembering all of the "Good Times" we've spend together and all that good stuff. It was kewl because we start to go over like our whole friendship and how we would miss each other and how she is one to be missed because she is such a great/ ausie gal or as some would say "chik". I really hope she does n't move to NJ brb people,.
