It was like a three hour bike ride...I said last time I wouldn't do it again. I agreed on my way home today as well. But actually, Parksville beach was the location of yesterday's activities as well. I went to a car show. It was a quite boring car show, there were only a couple of cars I enjoyed. Nothing like the Pacific National Auto Show at BC Place a few months ago. These were basicly old cars that old people had from around the province. Included are a few photographs of half-decent vehicles from my the un-exciting event.   I took this one because of my conversation with Dave. He wants to become a Pimp.    Hands down stupidest vehicle at the show, the "cool bus"  ...I would have probably included more...but they would just be a waste of server space.
