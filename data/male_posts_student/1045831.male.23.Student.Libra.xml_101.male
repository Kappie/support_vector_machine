I have actually lost like 11 pounds over the last week which is a lot, especially because I'm not exercising yet.  I started on Tuesday and I weighed 240 and now I am down to a slim (ok.. slimmer) 229.  I have not drank since Tuesday May 25 and my goal is to keep it that way until July.  Lets just see if I can do it.  This is the first step in my summer plan to become Metro-sexual.  I have set up a totally different blog to track my progress from slovenly drunk to hip, stylish metrosexual so you can follow my progress there, @  urlLink metrosexualmadness.blogspot.com.   Here I will just talk about what's been going on in my life like always.  Oh yeah I'm in the process of finding a new job and it looks like I might end up in the wireless business like Bonomo which would be nice but who knows.  Other than that I'm off.  Oh yeah Paul and I are going to Raul's tonight to play Texas Hold 'em so if you interested there's games at 7:00 and 10:00.  Later...
