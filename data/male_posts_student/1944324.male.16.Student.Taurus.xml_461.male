I'm blogging from school, because I'm grounded (for two days) because I didn't wash my dishes. Feh.  I'm sitting next to a girl who comes into the library everyday and sends e-mails to her uh..."significant other" consisting of nothing other then "HEY BABY! I MISS YOU! I LOVE YOU." She seriously creeps me the hell out.  It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar.
