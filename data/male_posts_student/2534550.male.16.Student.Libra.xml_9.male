Not the title of the song, lol but this is the most reggae.  YAY!! B Corps is living again! I've had the absolute best day since I last posted. Info on BDB is on the front page of  urlLink BlueDevils.org . The new page of B Corps is now  urlLink www.bluedevils.org/programs/b/ 2004  . YAY!! Oooooh. Ok. I love B Corps.   It's so hard for me to imagine that I'm now a vet. Wow.... people will look at pictures of Blue Devils B Corps and say,     "Hey, look at that hornline! They really put out with such limited numbers"   That's us guys. Wow. I'm in shock...really   rockin to: Chronometry/Chomolomety/Chrononomety- "First Circle/Full Circle" -Pat Metheny   dah dit dah. you know I can play that part perfectly now, Austin? i can play the mello part that accompanies it too...the part that goes to our high Bb.   PLEASE!!! COME MARCH BDB!!!   I think I'm going to cry. I've never been so excited about something. honestly. Last year, lol, last year, when I wrote to Charles asking to be part of his corps, I called it a band. Hah. How naive I once was.  Wow...its so weird to be thinking I'm now a vet. Not a super vet like Taryn or Daphne... but still. Oh wow. It is 35 days, 7 hours, 26 minutes and 9 seconds until January 11, 2004, at Noon.   Eek....Oh I can't wait. Austin and I are assuming they'll have our rep pretty much set, since we need to be more perfect than last year.   rockin to: Chronometry/Chomolomety/Chrononomety-  "Kinetic/Kintec" -John Meehan   Wow. I'm so in love right now. I can't stop smiling. How did I ever get through this excitement last year without Austin?
