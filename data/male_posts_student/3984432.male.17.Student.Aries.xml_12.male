In case you didn't get to this site through a link on the BBC's home page, check it out  urlLink here .  Members of the BBC staff will be posting on this site whenever they feel like it so that you can see what it is like to produce out daily broadcasts.  Since our old set is now part of the construction site, we'll soon be moving our set to what used to be the Faculty room and make that our home for the next year (hopefully not any longer than that!).  Stop by this blog often to see what is going on in the BBC!
