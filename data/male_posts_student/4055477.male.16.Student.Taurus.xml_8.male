I give all of the associates their breaks and close registers..  Sicko..  )    - -But anyways, it's so nice that I dont have to be in one little box for 4 hours straight.. (I get to be in different little boxes,  so there!..  )    ..There's an increase in shoplifting lately.. It's embarrassing b/c most of the ppl who live in my apartments across the street are the shoplifters! (I still dont understand what a person would do with $300 in sears giftcards except buy gifts for their grandparents..)  Stupid ppl..    Whatchu talkin bout willis?  (Sorry, I just wanted to say that..)  Thats basically it for today... I got a party to go to on Monday so that'll be fun (Me being the only sober one and all..)
