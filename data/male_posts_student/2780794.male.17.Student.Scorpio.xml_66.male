Rizal, the gay defender in SP IVP has engaged a lawyer to settle a dispute over his sprained neck and sore right eye. It seems he was unfairly elbowed in the face and was pushed against the boards with unfair justice given out by the referee. He was reported to be pissed by the incident and almost caused a brawl which resulted in Shamil breaking his stick. -=]biar btul sak?[=- His gay partner, Adzmin , reportedly said that "I will fight for Rizal's right and make sure he gets his insurance. He was unfairly elbowed!" The case is reportedly to be of little importance to the SP Board as the amount of insurance Rizal could get is pittance compared to the amount they have. What is most important is the extent of his injury. He is out for 6-7 days and may need to have last minute checkups before the ITE WEST CLEMENTI clash on Sunday.  CNA has launched a new debate over the SP IVP Squad. It concerns matters of SP Floorball and is reported to bring in a record number of viewers for its first screening on Sunday at 2pm. The debate which started a week ago discusses about the lines present in the SP Squad. The IVP Squad of the first 15 have been finalised yet some are still unsure of their strategy.  The veteran members of the squad,notably Jie Hong and Ahmad are strong defensive kingpins which strike fear to defenders not only because of their size but their tactical defensive know-how. -=]I'm not reallie sure what i'm talking abt tho...:)[=- However,the over-reliance on these players may result in total defensive play thus making the line boring and unproductive in obtaining the goals.  The youth players however are very promising. Shamil -=]which juz broke his stick :P[=- has proved to be a gd defender together with Zaki marshalling defence and breaking up attacks. However,their strike-force are barely tested with Shaiful taking few shots at goal. Their pace and youth may inject fresh ideas into the squad but their talent are still raw yet to be unleashed.  The prime players however are being over-relied on. They had to score as well as defend and become role models too towards the younger generation of players. Some are feeling the fatigue and may snap if they do not have enough rest. Hafiz notably,have been tired and so do Akil and Adzmin. They have played in almost every friendly and training and should their endurance fail so would the rest.  As reported by, Maxigencical Corporation.
