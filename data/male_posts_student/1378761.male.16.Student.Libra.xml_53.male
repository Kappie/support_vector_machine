It is getting really boaring staying at home all the time. I am watching a lot of movies, but not working on mine. I worked on  urlLink Twilight Media's website  some. I also am working out some more weddings to get done. Possibly 3. I am excited. I am still working out my prices. I am going to talk to Mr. Spencer and his brother Rich to see how my prices are. Rich films a lot of weddings and has lots of experence.   I have the fender for my car all painted. It took 2 cans of finish spray paint and 1 can of clear coat. It dose'nt look that bad at all. I am going to buy some red-stained wax for my car to hide some of the paint chips from stones. I should help it too look better. I hope by this weekend my car will be a hotrod!!!  Thats about all I got for now. Cya later!! Eric
