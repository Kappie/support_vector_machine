So anyway, if you watched the second season of Last Comic Standing, I'm sure you saw the lovely Kathleen Madigan (who should have at least made it to the Final Three) . I just want to post her web address here:   urlLink  http://www.kathleenmadigan.com    and I encourage you all to check it out, this is a really classy and funny lady. You can see my letter to her under the "Ask Kathleen" heading. -Todd
