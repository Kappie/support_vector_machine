I kinda wanna go out tomorrow, since the carpet's going to be cleaned starting at around 9 in the morning. Eh, I'll probably just hang at the park for a while.  The walk home was nice. I've been walkin to Tampa after school w/ Stephanie (hope that's how you spell it.) She's pretty kewl, except w/ the whole hesitation towards hugs. I can't hold that against anyone though. No worries. I wanna have long, pretty hair like yours =[.   I want to stay awake, but I have nothing to like... do. Wutev, I'll jus go listen to music.
