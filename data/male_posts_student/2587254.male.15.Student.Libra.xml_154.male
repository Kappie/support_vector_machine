Then again there were some cool parts, but I won't reveal them and let you figure them out on your own by paying money to go see it. But yeah I'll talk more about that later...for now you can read the rest of the entry, or picture in your head how mediocre Spiderman 2 really was, or skip down to the paragraph about it...  I woke up today around 1030 once again, and this morning decided to do my devos early in the morning. I read around Colossians 3:13, pretty much Colossians chapter 3. The chapter was about how once you become Christian your aim is to change from your old ways. I really enjoyed reading this passage, as just the encouragement alone in the passage helps I hope all Christians know that God will always help you back up on your feet, and also that we are all on the same boat on earth, and to keep one another from falling, encourage one another, and don't laugh at another's fault. On another subject, while doing my devos, I kept on wondering how some Non-Christians don't want to believe because they think God doesn't want them. I was actually talking to one of Carmen's friends about that, and I don't see how in the world he made that connection when probably half the Bible speaks of God's love. How can people see something like that?  After doing my devos, I slowly got ready to head to downtown to meet up with Josh and Ginnie. I also got my money ready, as I was going to deposit money today. My account will be back up to a healthy almost $400 dollars, and then I'd spend a lot today haha. So I left around 1230pm or so, and met Josh at the Scotiabank tower around 1245pm...ish. I called him on the cell in the building to find out where he was, and there he was, standing outside totally clueless that I'm indoors already. Ginnie then came afterwards, and we went to Jasper's for lunch. I heard Ryan Ruderford got the job there, that's cool I guess, and also I still got student discount =). Food was top notch quality like usual, and I couldn't fit all the pasta in me, not even thinking about the complimentary garlic bread. Yeah after being stuffed, we then walked to Bellone's, to finally go amp shopping  for Ginnie.  I went there mostly just to check out a guitar if I am considering, and also to look at some drumheads and cymbals. After going there, I then got stumped on what to buy, and decided I'd go home to look at some stuff on the internet first. So while I was oogling at the cymbals and drumheads, Josh was playing around with a defretted bass, which he is now very attached to *but he has no money unfortunately* and Ginnie was trying out different amps. In the end, she bought a 10 W or so Marshall, which is actually a pretty sweet one. The staff member there who was the specialist in guitars ROCKED. He was actually insanely good on the guitar...makes Gavin look like Gavin before he learned new strum patterns haha. So eventually Ginnie bought the little amp, and I got a pair of wooden sticks, since Zavitz and Shaunvir both convinced me to change from nylons. Nylon tips though do have two disadvantages that wood sticks would never have:  -The nylon tip comes off very easily. I could pull one off probably. -The nylon tip leaves white marks, meaning I have to clean more often.  Wooden sticks...they just get soft after a while and break.  After goin' there, I got home by bus around 330pmish, and began my search for Zildjian or Sabian cymbals, and what Remo heads I'd buy. Also during this time chatted with Maisie, Josh, Jason, Lina, and various other people. This would also be the time that Josh announced our domain is totally up and working. It may be bland, but it works. So far Josh, Jason, Gavin and I share the space on this spit spat of webspace, where eventually a much better blog will be up...once I borrow Jason's book on CSS, XHTML, XML, AND HTML =). For the moment, you're stuck with this =P. Drummed around for a while, and then my dinner would consist of a veggie/fruit platter that my mom made. It was good, and I don't complain, it made me full =P, and even had enough for leftovers which I'm almost done eating around now. Maisie and I shared some more files, and before I knew it I had to meet Jason at Masonville since me and him wanted to go to Champs earlier, me because I wanted to grab a Yao jersey for 35 bucks and Jason to look for future things to buy.  Got to Masonville around 640ish, and then bought my Yao jersey. Checked out EB, HMV, and other places too. Apparently Masia One CD came out a LONG time ago...August 2003. Anyways point is, I'll order it some other time, and stick to DJ Doboy music for now.  After that short time of mall prowling, we went back to meet up with the others for the movie. Twins and Jonny where there, and Josh, Rebecky, and Gavin then showed up. Gavin received his guitar capo present that me and Josh bought from Bellone's today, and Josh even wrapped it up in duct tape haha. So everyone was here...except Carmen and Lina...  Sad part is, they've been at the mall since 5:30, and sadly THEY'RE STILL LATE. So in the end we decided to go in anyways without them I mean they showed up five minutes before the show somehow. So when they FINALLY got there, the movie had just started, so yeah they were lucky haha. Theatre had been packed since 730, so we had to sit somewhat scattered. Jason, Gavin, Josh and I sat where there were legrests, while the others managed to fit themselves 2 rows behind us. From then on the movie started...  Now I guess the movie wasn't ALL that bad, with some really cool parts like the Subway fight. During that battle, there was this one part where everyone in the theatre basically went "whoa" and Gavin sadly missed the part haha. In the end we told him, but you have to see it I think. There were other good parts, but go watch it yourself =P.  Afterwards we all chilled at McD's for a bit. Saw Kurtis there and chatted with him for a bit, then went back to the others. So we sat around for a bit, chatted, and then I had to go home, and give Lina a ride back also.  So here I am now, blogging, eating, and chatting with Ju, Jason, and was with Jenn on MSN. Haven't talked to Ju in ages, so yeah good to see her still talkin' haha. Gerts is shocked to hear me mock Spiderman, so she left with a "PFFT!"  Anyways I'm gone for now. I don't know what the heck I'm doing tomorrow for Canada Day.   Later.
