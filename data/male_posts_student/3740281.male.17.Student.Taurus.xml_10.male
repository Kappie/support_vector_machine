IM GETTING TANNER!!! its kool...lol...and beach again tomorrow...tis good.   Ooo today at the beach...there were these 2 girls...funny as hell...they were putting on makeup at the beach. then they undid their straps while they were tanning...and then they got up and went somewhere, so Kona and i ran past their spot and "accidently" kicked sand all over their towels... then as we were leaving i tried shooting them with my lil squirt gun...we pussied out of tackling eachother on top of them...woulda been funny as hell tho and the sand woulda gotten all over their oiled up backs...woulda been great.. and today i got hammered...absolutely hammered by the huge ass wave...i was under water for 10 seconds...getting tossed around. When i finally came up i didnt know where i was for a few seconds..but i got really close to the pier. Later i got my back bent up like a V from another wave...lol all in all it was a good day lol... im out tho, peace
