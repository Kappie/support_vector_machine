One bad thing would be that I don't get to spend my lessons thinking about the gorgeous Anna beside me *meh*. However now I guess I'm really stuck as what to do with the rest of my life. I guess I'll just have to wait and see how the results turn out.  Just learnt I'm of to the Greyhorse to see Law twang his tunes - and to give Jenny a hug after her epic *find me a bloke day* turned out to be amazing after all seemed lost. Ah brings a smile to your face . . . xBuBzx
