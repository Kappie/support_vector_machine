"I'm so sorry I've got a throbbing headache and I've only just woken up - I'm really sorry."  Then with my eardrums barely awake, they shudder at the Canning town accent, reminiscent of the girls that Barron hangs around with - "uurr ly-in".  "I'm really sorry Kate, I'll try and make it up to yo . . . " - the line crackles and she has hung up in her arrogant - I'm fitter than you because I've got died blond hair, and fake gold jewelry and Â£1.20 foundation with classy vocabulary in everything I say, and I'm of to suck Michaels cock so he'll beat up this boy who's been giving me "beef" kind of way.  So the previous evening, Dad had come marching in to the study proclaiming "BE HERE AND WE'LL HAVE LUNCH AT ONE!", which obviously bought a large grin upon his several chin-ridden face.  So anyway, last night was rather a bore, with the German being ill, It was spent in, and a extreme early night, especially for me of 7 o'clock. Although I did awake suddenly as I got a call from an old friend - Lauren, who no is living with a new bad boy and thankfully out of that shithole of a home of hers, and so should sometime meet up with her somewhere.  Tonight should be better however, as the German is feeling rather better and we plan to go mass drinking for the first official day of summer. HOORAH! xBuBzx
