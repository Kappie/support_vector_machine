I know you wrote something.  -Marcus   Anyway, I'm listening to "Ward of the StateII", and it still puts me on my ass.  I've never heard any song that can actually evoke an emotional response other then this song.  It's just... damn, it's just a heavy song.  It has alot more angst then other rap, and the fact that it's justified from first hand experience only makes it heavier.  Yeah, I'm holding my tongue for awhile.  It's bad not to let off pressure, especially of the mental/social type, but whatever.  I'm holding this one in vatos, so take a hit of this and go home.
