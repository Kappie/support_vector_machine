And now that Im here, im lookin at getting married and starting a family....but i wonder isnt there more to life than just workin your tail off in school so you can get a good job and make money ? I mean, im all for making money and all that but isnt there more to life ? And i know ppl will say oh yea there is more, you know helping your family, community, and having a good home life. But alot of that involves alot of other people. Not necessarily the individual. I think we should spend some time getting to know ourselves. Taking time out from our life plans outlined like blueprints of a house. Learn something you've always wanted to learn just for the fun of it. Something that might not help you in any way in terms of business or anything like that. Like learning to play the piano, or guitar, learn how to surf. Or beyond that get away from your life and do something completely different. Like work for a year as a paramedic, bartender, police officer; whatever interests you. And why are you doing this ? Not to further your career, i mean if that happens thats great but just for the experience of it. Just to learn how you deal with a new situation and new surroundings. 1 year is not that much time in anyone's life and you never know you may find something you truly enjoy. I would hate to wake up in 15 years and realize that I hate what Im doing for a living and just wishing i was doing something else. I would love to work a not so glamorous job and go surfing in my free time. Live a laid back lifestyle that was more about enjoying my short time here on earth rather than frantically trying to make as much money as possible and increase my responsibilities as fast as i can.    Im sure someone is reading this thinking  " well he just isnt concerned with his future. he just wants to have fun and not concern himself with reality. the importance of an education and the money that comes from working a good job (doctor, lawyer, engineer blah blah blah). when he gets older he will know better. "  but if i look at reality what i see is a country of people who work themselves crazy just to make ends meet in a lifestyle that they are struggling to live.  it seems like no matter how much money ppl make we spend just enough of it to stress out ourselves bald.  Even a millionaire somehow manages to worry about how much money he is spending. Maybe if I make alot of money and only spend it when i have to then i can relax and enjoy my life instead of working 10 hour days everyday from the time im 25 till im 65......now maybe this is the crack talking but i would rather live a slightly more modest lifestyle and not have to worry about money during my life rather than make a lot of money and still stress about whether or not ill be able to put my kids through college. maybe ill drive a honda instead of a n acura, or a toyota insted of a lexus.....just cause you CAN afford to buy something doesnt necessarily mean you should.....  I would love to learn how to play the piano, guitar, learn how to surf and all that, but sadly ill be too busy paying off the million dollar debt on my head for the next 10 years....wouldnt life be simpler if i was a surfing bartender ? i think so.......
