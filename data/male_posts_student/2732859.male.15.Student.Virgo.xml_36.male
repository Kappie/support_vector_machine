It was a great speech. He delivered it well. You can imagine him standing at the podium in the US House of Representitives delivering the State of the Union to Congress and America. He addressed the key issues facing the nation today. This was a winning night for Kerry and the next big night for Senator Kerry is going to be the first debate with President Bush this fall.
