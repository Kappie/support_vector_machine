Grr.. ) This morning I spent most of my day lookin up buddy icons and listening to music. (So, you can tell i've been really busy this summer..)  " ... ... ... "   - I didnt get to float today so I spent my day at work up in my little cage in kids.. (They really call it a cashwrap but they can go  f***  themselves b/c it's not..) I Feel like a hamster in that damn thing.. ( walk to one side, turn around, walk to the other side.. so on.. so on.. )  And they wonder why I count my registers down five minutes after I get there ( So I can get the hell out! )  - - Do you ever feel like your "fake" when your at work? Sometimes I just wonder what I would really say if they werent paying me to stand in the cage (sorry, "cashwrap" ...)   What I say now:    Customer:  Well, The sign says it's 30% off and if you dont give it to me than i'll never shop here again.  Me:  Mam, i'm soo sorry. I'll call someone over to go re-check the price for you. Sorry for the inconveniece (3 Minutes later) Have a nice day! (b**** walks away with the 30% off..)   What I would say if the pay was too low...    Customer:  Hi, could someone help me over here!  Me:   (standing in opposite corner) " ... ... ..."  Customer:  Excuse me, young man! .... ok, let me speak to your manager  Me:  (slowly walk towards the woman) "... ... ...." (bitch slaps her and her children)  Customer:  My Lord! I'll never shop here again.. (holds face where big red hand mark is..)  Me:  (back in the corner now..) (tilts head, shrugs, smirks, and laughs..) (gets ready to bitch slap her again..)  Customer:  (runs away..)  Bitch-Ass Customers...  (lol)  (Ok, maybe i'm not really  that  mean.. but its nice to think about..)  Anywayz i'm goin to go look at cars to buy tomorrow.. Then I got that party on monday and I was goin to geauga lake but not anymore.. But then again, there's always room to shop.. (I love blowing that  chump change  I get from sears..)
