I'm glad I'm getting new glasses because my old ones were so scratched up that I saw "rays" -lines-coming out of lights when I looked at them.    We decided to get new frames  and  lenses. The ones we got this time fit better and took 1/6 of the time it took to pick out my old ones. These are rimless too. I still can't wait until I get contacts though.
