Thank you, Linda Carroll.  I then had pizza for dinner, preceded and followed by general fun, including hammer-toss, a game in which Graham and I stand across the yard from each other and throw a hammer as close to each other as we can without killing the other person. Good times.  We then decided to make fudge with my mom, a certified executive pastry chef. After scrounging the chief ingredient, unsweetened chocolate, from Linda, we helped my mom make it. She messed up in a rather crucial phase and it turned grainy. She was extremely aggravated and we decided to buy another package of chocolate and whole milk. (This was at 9:45.)  When we got done, we made another batch and it got ruined. Well, we're trying again tomorrow as she believes she's isolated the problem. Then we're going roller skating. Tell you how it goes. (Something usually happens worth talking about.)   We are bits of stellar matter that got cold by accident, bits of a star gone wrong.  (Sir Arthur Eddington)
