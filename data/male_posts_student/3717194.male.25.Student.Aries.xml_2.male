As I did with Brock,I did a modicum of research to dig up fun things from Timmy's history...I found some stuff...but I will first do the comparison that has becomethe hallmark of the  Weekly Brock ; the comparison in which I point outthe subject's strong points and my comparitiveweaknesses.   Let me first say that I have an outstanding credit rating; there is one simple reason for this fact, Timmy; were it not for Mr. Romance who handled finances (and not begrudgingly)for the entire apartment throughout my undergraduate career, I wouldcertainly behiding from creditors and cable men inMexico. I can also say that I have been pressing my luck with creditors ever since Tim and I graduated and I had to 'learn to write checks' and 'havebank accounts' and 'pay bills.' I have learnedabout such entertaining things as 'bouncing checks' and rememberingPIN numbers' and 'making deposits'. So the first tally is:  Timmy: Good with money. Ted: Sucks with money.   I also learned a lot about women fromTim. He has an exceptional ability to 'not give a crap' or 'not put up with whiny chicks'. (It is important to note that Tim's ability to do this is nowhere near Brock's ability to do so, which borders on pathological--Brock once dated a girl for like nine months and then just stopped calling her. Why? Quote: 'I dunno, she wasn't that cool.') So consequently, Timmy is better at sustaining relationships that I. For example, our next tally:  Number of failed engagements:  Timmy: 0 Ted:1   The final comparison I will make is in overall coolness. This topic was subject for debate when Tim, Christian, and I lived at Ghettoridge 3C. The easiest way to identify who was cooler was to look at our music collections. Tim's collection included: Monsters of Rock Vols. 1-10, Monster Ballads Vols. 1-10, Ozzie Osbourne Live and Loud, GNR, Whitesnake (pictured above), and various other hardcore bands. Timmy could oft be cajoled into performing an intoxicated and shirtless version of 'Here I go Again'...a 3C favorite. My collection, however, included Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, Hanson, and various other non-hardcore artists...and as everyone knows thanks to Jack Black,'you're not hardcore (no you're not hardcore), unless you live hardcore (unless you live hardcore)'. So our final tally:  Do you livehardcore?  Timmy: Yes Ted: No  Do you need more proof of Tim's hardcore status? That is where my research comes in. The underlying links prove two things: 1) Timmy was on the Honor Roll in College; and 2) Timmy got busted for public intox.
