But i guess its cool to be her best friend, now i need to learn how to live with that idea, to never stop thinking about her {like i've been doing} but also no thinking about her as somehting else besides my best friend, and let things happen as they should and as destiny wants. She sent me a really nice e card, i told her she was the penguin and i was the rabbit, i hope we can be friends for a long long time. I love her so much. I miss having class with her.
