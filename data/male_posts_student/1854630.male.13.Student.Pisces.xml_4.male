I don't mean that when I got back home (two hours ago or so) I thought, "Wow, this weekend had some great material for the blog." No, while it was happening, I was thinking that I would be writing about it. I was writing a rough draft in my head, trying to find which words best fit the situation, in what way I could express how I felt at the time.  There I was, on the beach, getting burnt to a crisp by the sun. I was building a sandcastle, desperately running back and forth from the wet sand to a bit higher up on the shore where I was building my castle wall. The tide was getting closer and closer to the wall with each wave, the water looked like Poseidon's arms reaching to bring my castle to its demise. Yet still I built my castle higher and higher, testing the strength of man against the forces of nature. At last it looked as if I had won, I reigned victorious in the everlasting battle between humanity and the elements.  The war ended at a convientent time, a man and his son began to walk toward me and my family (who were higher still up the shore). After a few seconds I identified them to be the boy who was having the Bar Mitzvah, the reason my family had driven up this weekend, and his father. They had come to greet the out-of-towners all staying at the hotel. They walk over to my mom, and soon after she calls me over.  "Dave, honey, come say hi to the  d 's!" I walk over, realizing that I haven't seen this guy in about six years. "Oh hey Dave," his dad says. The Bar Mitzvah boy is very clean cut. He's wearing a hat, but I can see his hair spiked up in the front, and very short sideburns. He has And-1 shorts on, some sort of basketball shirt on, and what look to be expensive basketball shoes. He's very tan, and is about six feet tall.  On the other hand, I'm shirtless, pale, and covered in sand. I'm a pretty scrawny guy, and don't really feel comfortable with my shirt off around people. For the past year or so, my nipples have been rather puffy, and I'm really self-conscious about it. It might just be puberty, I don't know. The point is, I was feeling very uncomfortable as my mom and his dad were chatting away.  "Oh, Dave plays the guitar too," my mom says. "Really?  a  hasn't been practicing as much as he should. Do you really like it, Dave?"  a 's father asks. "Oh, um, yeah," I said looking at the ground. "So what sports are you into?" his dad asks me.  I hate that question. I'm not very athletic. I don't play any organized sports. Sure, I play basketball and ride bike at my friend's houses, but I'm not in any organized league.  "Oh, I'm not playing any sports right now," I hear myself mumbling, the best thing I can come up with at the time.   This ackward questioning goes on for about ten minutes until the  d 's have to go talk to other people. With that over with, I decide to go in the ocean and cool off for a while.  Fighting the forces of nature is hard work.  I'm wading in the water, feeling the waves lift me up, when I look over at my sand castle, and gasp. Its gone. All of it. Completely destroyed. I see a mound of wet sand where once stood a luxiorious castle. At this point, theres usually only one thing to do.  I closed my eyes, and let the waves carry me back to shore. I claw at the sand, mumbling nonsense to myself. I hear my mom yelling something, but continue. I'm on my stomach, pulling myself higher onto the shore. I open my eyes, and look up, to see a thirty-something year old woman sitting in a chair laughing at me. What are the odds that I'm beached right in front of her chair? Really. I stand up and go back into the water, letting the sand fall off my body.  Alright, I'm going to be honest. I can't write any more about this right now. Theres only so much I can write before my writing turns into total crap. I think I crossed that line a few paragraphs ago. In conclusion, go read the Doonesbury comic today. God bless our troops.   Or something like that.
