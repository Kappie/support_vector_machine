Yes, it's my sisters birthday party, and it's planning on being loud and annoying. Some one with a big house, save me! We could make it Sophia's going away JournalCon, despite the fact that she'll still come to other journalcons. Or maybe it could be a Sophia's not really leaving JournalCon. C'mon, sometimes you have something to say. Thomas doesn't post frequently, and niether do I anymore. Just post when something interesting happens to you, or when you happen to something interesting. Once you're gone, you'll have something you wanted to post. Please stay with us?  I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!
