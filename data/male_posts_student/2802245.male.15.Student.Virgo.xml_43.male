I suppose me being generally lazy probably contributed...Okay...I  was  just generally lazy... Bleh... Exams are over... results are in... and as usual, I've managed to cock up some subject or another... normally its French or RE... but this time its Biology...  Parents were  not  pleased... in fact, pleased was probably the last word you could use to describe them at that point...  *sigh*  Meh...
