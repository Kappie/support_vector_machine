Emily and I have realized we are the world's worst housekeepers. We ended up jumping on some of the beds, making a landing are out of pillows on a bed an jumping into them in creative ways, and just being horrible in general. After work, I went home (naturally.) My mom left for work, and my dad took my sis and Carlos down to NYC. So again, I had the house all to myself for a whole day.  Later on, a certain guy came over we had some pizza, watched Sex  the City... Let's just say I won't be chilling with that one EVER again. Today is also the day that Rob the Rower :-*(ROB!) leaves for Spain... *tear*... I'll miss you (er, your online persona)... So now (again), I'm updating this blog... and now I'm gonna get dressed and read.      Kosketa minua; 채l채 k채sill채si... Mutta sielussasi.  //  Touch me; not with your hands... but with your soul.
