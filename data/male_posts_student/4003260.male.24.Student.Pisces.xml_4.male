Have to admit I only made it through 12-hours, but it was a fantastic 12-hours.  A small frickets tournament was setup to accompany the Ultimate.  First time I have played this wonderful little game and am already hooked.  Only had a chance to play it once, but am dying to give it another go.  Other 'big news' at the tournament was this new fangled  urlLink Penta Water .  Apparently this stuff is treated with high energy sound waves to break down the length of the H2O molecules so your body can absorb it faster.  You can imagine we took full advantage to play up / mock this new marvel of science.  Good times!
