Im going for my lisence in a few days.I know i should have it by now but i just havent gotten round to it.I should be able to do it.       my two mates are worrying about there lives after school and what unis to go to and if thay should split up and go to different places or not.They should just go with it.       For me who knows what ill do may be ill go to wellinton with my other mates and do a computing course or go to auckland with some girl mates of mine.work with my uncle in auckland also or go to hamilton and flat with my mate.even go down to otago and stay down there if i wanted with one of my mates.       But i more then lickly will go to australia to work on a tourisum based job living with my aunti since shes offered.It will be a change for a while.       Who knows aye.
