That's just not right. Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised by my results.  There are 36 points possible in each main category and 18 points possible in each sub-category. The rank in parenthesis indicates what percentage of students scored at or below my score.  Here's the breakdown of my scores:   English:  34 (99) Usage/Mechanics: 17 (99) Rhetorical Skills: 18 (99)   Mathematics:  27 (89) Pre-Algebra/Elementary Algebra: 14 (84) Algebra/Coordinate Geometry: 14 (93) Plane Geometry/Trigonometry: 14 (91)    Reading:  28 (87) Social Studies/Sciences: 11 (60) Arts/Literature: 18 (99)   Science Reasoning:  25 (86)   Composite Score:  29 (95)  Although my composite score is good enough to get some sort of scholarship, I think that, given some time to study, I can raise my scores in science, reading, and math, and maybe bump my composite score up one or two points.
