Strangely though, it feels weird this year after breaking from school. A huge part of me feels glad that I've finished, giving me the chance to take a break from actually doing some work, and now being able to wander around Swindon.     In other ways though, I do miss school somehow this year. School was really the only way for me to regularly see my friends without having to make up excuses not to make it to meet-ups or whatever. Not only that, but I did find some of the work set to me fun and challenging too.     I've decided to keep in contact with my tutor during the holidays, so I shall be sending him an e-mail on Monday to see how things are, and hopefully I'll get a reply soon after.     Saturday was fun. After waking up late, I still managed to meet James in town, along with Devon, Stephen and his friend Amy. Little did I know that in town the Swindon Festival was taking place, so I was surprised that as I passed the Millennium Clock, creatures that resembled Chocobo's (in many colours) were creeping about. Afraid, I quickly found James and the others in time to be rescued, before any of them got near me! :)    (I shall include a picture of the Chocobo-like creature in the next entry)    I met Rach in town, as I was about to go to Virgin Megastore, had a little chat, then set off to purchase my fiftieth (:o) cd. For Â£7, I grabbed the  urlLink Red Hot Chili Peppers'  - 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik'. I've listened to it many times now and its a brilliant album, the best track on it obviously being 'Under The Bridge'.    So, me and the others walked around town for a while, passing the brass band on the main stage of the festival, and then walked off to some place which I didn't know of. James decided to get out his bag of glucose and eat a mouthful of it -- in front of a packed restaurant. The result, a large amount of glucose settling under his nose whilst people watch on in wonder. I think it goes without saying that we quickly rushed to the alley so that he could wipe it off.    After that, it was off to Lawns Wood for a good two hours or so, just messing about and calling Devon, "Emo Boy". James ate a whole lot of glucose and felt very sick, and soon after,  was  sick.    Me and James went on covert operations and snuck behind Stephen to pelt him with a banana, but before we could I screwed up the mission by being spot by Stephen. We still hit him with the banana though.    At 4:55pm we went to Co-Op (yay) to buy some food and drink. I bought two 500ml bottles of Pepsi for 81p (bargain) and left the shop. Remembered I was going to need a bag I re-entered the shop, went to take a bag, and dropped all the bags on the floor, thus making me the idiot.    Went home about 5:20pm, mainly because I was supposed to be home twenty minutes earlier. As I walked down the hill I could hear the cries of, "EMO BOY!" directed at me, so I gave James the swift finger and carried on walking. Woo.    Whilst walking down Upham Road I noticed two girls further down the road. Remembering I was wearing my Foo Fighters hoody, and the fact that it was quite hot that day, I knew that I was about to be called a goth. I was quite wrong, as one of the two girls happened to be Maria, so I had a quick chat before heading home.    Got home, parents weren't in yet. Yay.    The rest of the day carries on being uneventful, and then after getting back from my Nan's house, I head off to the land of Nod.    Sunday was boring, I didn't leave the house. More importantly, I didn't get dressed until after 3 in the afternoon. \o/ Lazy bonus score!    Hopefully I'm going out later today, as long as I get some rest now, as its 2am and I am le tired. Jams set me the challenge of taking one good photo of him over the summer holidays, so bored as I was, I went through my photo collection and found two pictures of Jams, and edited them. Of course they won't qualify for the challenge but I shall be asking Jams if I can put them up on here with his permission.    Oh how I love writing updates in the wee early hours of the morning.    Ciao.
