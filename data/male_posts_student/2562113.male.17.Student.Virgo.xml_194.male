I guess taking Physics II, Chemistry, and Calc II all in one semester is really pushing the limit. The overburdened workload of 6 classes in one semester is really taking its toll on my free time. Oh well, by next year all these stupid prerequisite courses will be over and I can finally start chipping away at my major. I'm looking forward to all the atmospheric science classes that Albany has to offer.  Errrrr...all of my favorite bands from the 90's are getting dropped from their record labels!!! Just a little while ago I found out that RCA records dropped Eve 6, one of my favorite bands from the late 90's. RCA also dropped Lit sometime last year. I fear that Third Eye Blind is next (which really pisses me off since their last album was great). It seems that most people listen to shitty music like Linkin Park or [insert name of shitty Linkin Park ripoff] these days and alternative-rock never gets the recognition it deserves.  -BIGsmut.  P.S. Come visit us!!!
