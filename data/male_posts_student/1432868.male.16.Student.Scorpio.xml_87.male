I recently learned that this Dec. they will release a the full album animated. Right now it is already out in France so it is kinda a bummer that I have to wait so long. Also the animator is Leiji Matsumoto isn't he the guy that does Cowboy Bepop? his name sounds quite familiar   if you are interested here is the site in French of course  urlLink Interstella 5555
