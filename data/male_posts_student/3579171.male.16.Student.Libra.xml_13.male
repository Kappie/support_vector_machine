The second is that it is not a very smart way of relieving boredom.  The third and final thing I realized is that having the same person IM you the instant you sign on can get irritating and annoying.  Keeping these three points in mind, especially the third one, I have come up with a few resolutions: 1.) Try to use AIM less(Try to sit and stare at the screen while AIM is on less.) 2.) Not to talk to anyone,  anyone , online unless they talk to me first, I have something really important to tell them, or I succumb to my boredom and  accidently  IM someone.  I don't know if I will actually be able to stick to these resolutions, but I'm going to try.  If I stick to them and not succumb, good for me.  If I succumb... well, who cares?  If I sucuumb I'll just act like I never wrote this in the first place.  Wish me luck... or not.  - Some loser   This is probably my shortest update yet, I'm so ashamed of my self... =P
