Ugh. i mean c'mon, you all should know that punk rock was founded on right wing ideals. take the sex pistols for example, with their anti-abortion lyrics and such. Or how bout the casualties, with their "kill the lefties" song? now i'm not condoning any violence towards democrats or the like, but hey, classic punk, right wing ideas :).    On another note, i want my permit already! i'm gonna be turning seventeen soon and no permit, ugh, i love how my girlfriends mom drives us everywhere, makes me feel REAL cool with myself. ;p.   wow.....i post alot
