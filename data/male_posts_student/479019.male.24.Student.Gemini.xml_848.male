In response to Nai's comment, the problem with blogs is that either they're often self-censored... I actually often delete my own posts, because I don't want the people I write about to read it. But what does it say about memory and feelings? What does this deletion mean in regards to one's dealing with thoughts and emotions?  Now playing: Rancid - "Salvation"  I have a lot of work to get done, that I don't want to do. Maybe I'll paint instead of do work? I'm getting all hobbied up right now... painting and rollerblading...  Day #2 of rollerblading yielded some better results, but I still have a long way to go.  My mood is a lot better right now... I think a big factor is the changing weather. Although at the party last night, it seems that lots of people are feeling tired with the semester. There was some interesting conversation as well...  Someone gave me some good advice on love and life... She was asking why I don't have a girlfriend and all that. She said that for someone as young as me, I shouldn't be settling and falling back like older people. I still have plenty of opportunity, unlike many of the people at the party. The thing is, I don't know if I can follow it. I don't know where I am in life right now, and it makes it hard to make right decisions.  Now playing: Ramones - "California Sun"  ***
