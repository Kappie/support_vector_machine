I have to agree with JetMech, that Baseball is "The Great American Pass Time". It's un-American to miss the World Series at the least, and who of us didn't at least play softball as young kid in the first few years of school, if no other sport. So I am one of those nominal Americans getting into this with more seriousness and fervor, and all of your enthusiasm is contagious for sure. So you all have my thanks.  Here is something I hope sparks a little discussion: I have 5 fantasy teams. The first one I was a nervous wreck at the live draft, at the end I thought I had screwed up something wicked and was totally devastated. I noticed looking at the final results of how it went down, that everyone else was very careful to pick up pitchers first. But me in my ignorance drafted players by rank first, not position. The next time I was far better prepared, and drafted based on what I learned from my mistakes. It turns out that my first team is in first place and my second team is in last place. By the time I drafted some of my last teams I decided there might be something to my first instinct, and yes, the teams where I didn't just go after pitchers first are all doing better.
