I got up, took my shower and just sat around a little. Then my dad asked me if I wanted to go fishing so I said yeah. So me, him, and my brother went out to Eureka Lake and fished. Now, the fish there are stupid. We never got one bite. A huge lake. Not one bite. And we asked 3 other people. And they said they got the same thing. No bites. How stupid! Stupid fish. So we got done and drove home. Then I said good bye to Andrew and Brian because they left for South Carolina today. They get to go south while I'm stuck in this stupid state. It's gonna be borning without them though. At least they are only going for a week. Then I went to church, and came home and ate. And just sat at home. I was gonna go bowling with Aimee but my parents went to the movies with my brother. And they just got home. And I have to get up early tomorrow. So paying 11 bucks to go bowling for about an hour and a half doesn't seem good money wise. I'm sorry Aimee! We'll have to go get some baked rigatoni at the Brick Oven when I get back on Monday night! And then we can have a cookie desert too! Yummmy! But then, because of my parents being gone. I sat at home and am still sitting at home. I have to get up early tomorrow so I'm gonna go to bed early tonight. For I'm not dead tomorrow. Later.
