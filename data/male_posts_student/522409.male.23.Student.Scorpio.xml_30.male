Alright, I've gotta get something out, because it's really been affecting me lately.  It'll sound strange, but I can almost guarantee it'll be the last I speak of it.  I am in a rough spot right now for some reason.  Emotionally, that is.  Y'know those tests they did way back when they took two groups of newborn babies and gave them lots of attention and lots of physical contact and took another group of babies and just fed them and gave them what they needed to survive, minus the human contact and those babies like, died or something?  Yeah.  So I'm absolutely starved for physical closeness.  Sounds dumb, right?  But I'm a really huggy-type guy, and I like being physically close to people.  And I guess it's just not happening right now, and it's really affecting me.  Ugh.  It sucks.  OH!!!  And I almost got in what could have been a really horribly greusome car accident this morning.  No kidding.  I'm late for work (I work in South Boston), and I took South Boston Bypass Road off 93, and turned on to D Street in Southie and I'm driving along in the messy, freezing rain and muck, and this pickup truck pulls out across traffic (he had a stop sign, I didn't) from a street on the right.  And I'm inside 100 feet from him.  So I slammed my brakes and yanked the wheel all the way to the left.  I missed the moron, thankfully, and my dad's car did one of those 360's you see in like, Nicholas Cage movies... which would have been really cool if I hadn't nearly lost control of my bodily functions and watched my as-yet-not-terribly-long life flash before my eyes.  Holy frig.  And the guy just kept going.  Fuckin' a.  I'd have followed the bastard if I wasn't already 15 minutes late for work.  So that was my mortality moment for the year.  And that's all I'm writing for now.  I'm going to go see the lovely Miss Sara Chase in Bat Boy tonight at the Boston Speakeasy.  Should be fun.  I'm glad I got the chance to go.  She JUST called me this morning to let me know that she had two tickets available.  Bless her heart.  An early birthday present.  I was going to try to catch the matinee performance on my birthday, but this is even better.   Alright.  I'm really going now.
