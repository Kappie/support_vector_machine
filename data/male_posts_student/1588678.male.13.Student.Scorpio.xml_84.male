If you haven't seen it, watch it, especially if you have On Demand FREE from Comcast (which we used)! It's great! They have tons of movies for free and you can pause, rewind, and fastforward, like TeVo!  It goes the same with music! We watched this video of Joe Strummer of the Clash doing "Redemption Songs" acoustically! So amazing! But in the video it shows people like the dudes from Rancid and just fans of Strummer and the Clash holding a big candle vigil for him. It's so moving; I almost cried.   Well, here's what to do this summer! Visit your peeps, order food, and watch movies and music videos! Enjoy your summer!  Feel free to leave me a comment on what you've done this summer!
