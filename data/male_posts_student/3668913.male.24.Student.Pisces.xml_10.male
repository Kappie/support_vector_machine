Well, time really flies, especially when you don't keep track of it. Hmmm... I am in a semi melancholic mode again, and I think the last thing now I need is to have someone call and talk about their own lives.... sometimes, I just wish that people can just look beyond the facade and see into the heart. Just pondering over issues that I had faced over my walk with God... so many decisions to make and so many "ifs"...    If I had not made a decision at 17 I want to come to church, I will still not be saved...  If I had not made a decision that I will give up my Post of bring the president of my JC guitar club, I would never have become committed to my cell group and church...  If I had not decided to make a decision to go under Bro Chris, I would not have grown so much...  If I had not made a decision to take on a vow till 21, I would never have become emotionally stable.  If I had not decided to quit ushering on the advice of my CGL, I would never had had a chance to rise up in cg.   If I had not gave up someone I like deeply while rising up, I would never have made it as a CGL.   If I had not step out in faith to do what other won't do and reach out to two old walk-ins called Lawrence and Annie, N110 would never exist today.   If I had not decided to live out my life in the will of God and pursue what my peers are going for right now, E260 would never have multiply.   If I had not decided to learn how to sing in Chinese and preach in Chinese before Pst Kong talked about the missions to China, I would never have been able to reach out to the 5 China members currently in my cell group.    So many ifs.... today, I had just made a new decision in a certain area of my life, that I will seek the will of God first and nothing else, that I will obey Him, even to my own hurt and no matter what my emotions are telling me.  Just gotta pray that the next "if" I add in the next time I do an "If" entry into this blog, I can share a testimony of what God has done in my life, because I had chose to turn "ifs" into "Yes Lord".
