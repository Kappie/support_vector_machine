The band is going good, hopefully we'll have a practice on Thursday because I'm hopnig to go to the SBH show on Friday! It's Scott's birthday today which is sweet! I can't wait to see what kind of dum surprises he gets. Today was a pretty good day. I got caught for being on the phone last night with someone though. That sucked. Not the first time, but this time my rents are like I'm gunna have to talk to you, so I dunno what will happen.  Tomorrow... oh Tomorrow, stay away for one more day. Don't come, unless you don't mind not staying for a day. Maybe you'll pass by quickly. Progress reports coming home in two weeks. Ah! Hopefully I did better than last semester. Lately I've been really working hard but I don't really have anything to look forward to later on this wee, except the weekend. Oh, and Thursday.  I'm out. peace
