Maybe I will get a little creative writing in. Oh I know, I can pay some bills. The Lakers play again tomorrow....please Timberwolves win!!   On a weird note: What's the deal with the oil? If we are fightening because we want more oil or cheaper oil, then how come gas is so F****ing expensive? I thought we "controlled" the oil fields according to Al Franken and Janine Garafaglo or however you spell it.   On a sc-fi note: Whitley Strieber of www.unknowncountry.com has one of the most facinating radio programs besides www.coasttocoastam.com with Art Bell and George Noory! Topics include but never limited to: secret government stuff, UFO's, aliens, technology, astronomy, robots (A.I.) etc...etc. Great stuff!!!
