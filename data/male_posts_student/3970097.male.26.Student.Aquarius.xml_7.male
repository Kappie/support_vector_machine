Horse and me, we both have nothing in common. Horse is an animal and well..!! what can I say about myself, you guys know me better, dont you peeps? Fred was just so high up with it that i decided to put some lines about it here so when he returns, he'll have something to read about. So here its for u Fred. I think that the idea of putting a theme of "born in the year of...." in the profile of a blogger here is quiet aweful. The guy must have been from Mars or some place near about, or maybe in the last hood, he/she was an animal, LOL... Not quiet so mad about being born in the year of horse, some people here were born in the year of Cows, Buffalows, Sheeps, Gerrafs and so on. But onething is for certain that Fred was born in the year of Godzilla, LOL. No offence my friend but you see, sometimes things are more than they appear. So have a laugh about it and keep it cool bcoz after all SIZE DOES MATTER. auright, i hafta write few lines to my mates back in Sydney, they have been complaining about not getting their replies in order. See ye all around and yea, keep your Jag off the corner, Fred..!! Have a nice day.
