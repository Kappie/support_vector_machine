It was no fun at all.  But I did take my car in today to get its brakes fixed so that my car will stop again. Yay...all for the super low price of $162.55. No seriously that is cheap. So ummmm...yeah ... thats all I've got for you today....that is it! I'm gonna clean my room tonight because I am that bored. For the last hour I have watched  Cops and ate three Ben  Jerry's Ice Cream cones. (2 Cookies  Cream, and one Brownie Batter). By the way Brownie Batter is the best ice cream ever! Tomorrow I get ta go to the airport and Portland so y'all can call my cell...Well that's it...I'll leave you with a good quote (well...more a verse). Till Later.  God will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear  Corinthians 10:13
