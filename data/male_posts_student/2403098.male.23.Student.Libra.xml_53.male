I went to bed last night at the ripe hour of around midnight, because my throat was super dooper scratchy, and I wanted to make sure I felt better by today.  As it turns out, it was solid this morning.  You know, when you can't even swallow because it's just solid, nasty, whatever-that-stuff-is in your throat?  I hate that.    I'm feeling a lot better today, and it was a PERFECT day to sleep in and listen to the rain.  I got some good rest, went to the city to help a friend retrieve their vehicle from the dealership and have a good meal.  OF COURSE I had to come home in time to see the season premiere of ABC's "The Bachelor."  No, not because I'm a huge fan of the ridiculous show, but because there's a tiny connection that brings it close to home.  My brother's EX - fiance' is on the show as one of the 25 contestants and has successfully made it to the next round.  WAY TO GO JESSICA, and DOUBLE way to go to my brother for not ending up in THAT relationship.  Goodness.  Anywho, you'll have to keep your eyes out for "Jessica" the attorney from San Antonio, Texas.  God love her, she's a nice girl.  I wont pretend to know the details of their engagement getting broken off and I especially wont pretend to care.  All I care about is my brother's happiness and the happiness I am now receiving from watching someone I vaguely know make a fool of herself on television.  He, apparently, broke the engagement off, and now a good few months later she's on the Bachelor flaunting her silliness.  Actually she's a very intelligent individual by the books.  An attorney, graduated at the top of her class, etc.  SOMEHOW though, in everyday life, she's a tard.  TUNE IN- you'll see, you WILL see.  What else what else what else.  I'm not sure.  I'm very much hoping that I can get some good sleep tonight.  I slept so sound last night.  I didn't even awake to the phone calls I received at 12:30am, 1:15am, 2:34am, 5:30am, and 11:30am respectively.  Sorry folks, I was stone-cold-snoozin'.  It was an interesting awakening to get the vast array of messages I received last night.  Not really even sure to do with some of the information other than make a confused face and go "hmmmm, okay."    Well, it's off to relaxation-land for me again.  Laying in bed, watching some TV, and allowing myself to drift off into sleepville.  Before I go, lauren wanted me to write this quote down so I wouldn't forget it.  It will mean nothing to any of the people reading this but her, but at least it will be on record.  So here is the snippet of the phone conversation between lauren and I earlier this evening on our cell phones:  lauren: "I can't hear well, do you ever have trouble hearing on your cell phone?" mason:  "with you... no"  LOLA talks loud, which is why it was somehow so funny at the time- and she LOVED that I said that.  it was totally a joke and not meaning to mock, but it was true.  I never have a problem hearing LOLA.  I think I hear her now, actually... and she's across town.  love you lola.  g'night and bring me some Vitamin C.
