Sixteenth century French economist Pierre Huet found England and Holland similar in that they kept their empire building focused on commerce, and fighting three wars to secure that commercial aspect was in the interests of both nations. (ii) He observed firsthand that over time economics and the war machine grew intertwined during the colonial period. Comparing the state of the two European powers to comments by Gustavus Adolphus and Francis Bacon, who gauged the health of the state on economic opportunity and a sphere of influence, Huet despised the use of military strength to achieve financial aims but noted its effectiveness. (iii) For the period’s empire builders, economic stability maintained itself through a reiteration of might. Queen Elizabeth’s England was not a considerable naval or commercial force at the start, but the gradual increase of the twain played either factor as a host upon the other. Funding of early trips that led to Muscovy and around the African continent would not have been undertaken had not the voyages been touted as an investment, nor would the search for a Northwest or Northeast Passage happened if lacking the chance for individual wealth. In turn, competition by both the English and Dutch against the Spanish until their respective victories over that nation honed their mercantile skills until the two were “the Terror of the Ocean and the Narrow Seas.” (iv) In relation to this fact, my friend Joe has a Dutch chemistry professor. He is nothing like the typical pot smoking Dutch guy that Joe had hoped he would be. In fact, he is just the opposite: a boring old fuddy-duddy that gets erections when he hears the word “eigenfunction.” Ironically, the two British students in the class don’t really get along with the Dutch professor. The frequently call him a “wanker” and kick him in the testicles while screaming their loyalty to the Manchester United soccer club. Fortunately, Holland and England are both in Europe, which is far away from here.      PR1121.U62 Reel 256:E177 no.14  Reel 377:11 Coke, Roger. A Discourse of Trade. London: H. Brome, 1670.
