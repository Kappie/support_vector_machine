I actually got some sleep last night so I didnt have to make up zebra stories :( Methinks i will make one up now........................done haha you will never know what it was about, maybe it was about you :p Anyway im going on holiday tomorrow so i wont be posting anything for a week. Think about it a whole week without you having to listen to me moaning on and on (yay).I watch this dude in Americas blog (  urlLink http://www.pasqualy.com/blog/ ) and he got a load of baby possoms!!! How cool would that be?? You could form an army and fight the evil cats. You could give them all positions in army like corporal and major, but i would be the general.  POSSOM POWER!!     We are having our house painted while we are away i hope i dont come back and not recognise where I am that could seriously screw my brain up, I mean im already messed up how it is. *yawn* im going to try and get a good nights sleep tonight, I hope i dont geta bad neck, oh yeah feel free to call me a loser whenever you want because i am one.      See you in a week   Tom
