Went into town with Scott today, was cool, thanks Scott. Lovoo. Then had trombone lesson, which was OK, as lessons go. Meh, I dunno, the first movement of the Serocki is complex... perhaps too much so for me to learn it perfectly, and keep the other 2 going, in 2 months. I should hope not, though... well, cause I've only got a month and 10 days. Silly NYO. Oh, and I've a v. high density of gigs coming up... I'm not going to list all of them but suffice it to say there are a lot.  Worried about Youth Makes Music on Wednesday. Not for the playing, that's quite easy, but actually for the fact that Becky'll be there watching her friend... and Laura'll also be there. Laura, if you're reading this, this isn't a "pull out" thing, I wuvoo, I really want you to come. I'm just saying, it might be weird... I dunno. If Becky displays to me the same non-commitedness that she has been doing I should be OK.  Just a question: does anyone actually know what love  is  anymore?
