I am now sleeping in a house with internet, cable, and all the other necessities of life.  I still have some stuff to bring over from the old house, minor things like my sister's desk, some beds, and some of my things. I need to get some of my clothing and shower accessories as well. It will be kind of hard to shower with no shampoo :P  Anyway besides all that, the past few days were alright. The funeral service on Saturday was very well done. I was impressed with the entire thing. His navy mates from the second world war were there and did a whole respect/honouring type ceremony. It was very nice.  Afterwards I was out at camp (as you can tell from my "interesting" audio post..) And that went fine, however, it did feel good to come back into town and clean myself with actual clean water. I can only camp for so many days...  Other than that, I really don't have too much to say, at this point anyway. I have been rather busy lately and times of thinking and poetry have somewhat faded. But now that everything is settling back to normal I will be back in the game :)  For now, I am going to go though, still got stuff to do.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Talk to everybody later... :)
