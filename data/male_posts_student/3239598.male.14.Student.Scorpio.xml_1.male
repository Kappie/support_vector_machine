Then I came back to school for the luncheon, which really pissed me off.  RAMON AND IAN SAT AT THE TABLE AND THEY WEREN'T WANTED!! AHHH!! I HATE THEM SO MUCH!!!  Jesus Christ died and saved us all!! I just wanna hit them so bad.  But, I shall resist.  Yea.. then I went to grandmama's.. and we talked about World War II and the concentration camps for like three hours... it was really quite interesting.  Then I came home and then left like right away for practice, which was rather violent.  Then, I came home, and you know what?  Ramon called me a loser!! OMG!! I AM NOT A LOSER, HE IS!! AND, DON'T PROTECT HIM, ABBY!! HE'S A LOSER, AND YOU KNOW IT!  That's all I got.  I just wanna say hello to everybody out there!! HI EVERYBODY!! And, I'd like to give a special shout out to my love Hillary.  Hello, my love! I love you so incredibly much!  That's all I got.  Buh Bye everyone!!  ~JACK SPARROW~
