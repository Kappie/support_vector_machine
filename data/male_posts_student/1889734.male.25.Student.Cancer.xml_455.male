I ceased being who I was, and I am now someone different.  I have been unhappy for months now. Going to classes, doing homework, and the daily chores of life have lost any meaning or enjoyment they once had. It was as if I was an animated doll going about some function. I was not alive but merely living. Last night I realized exactly why. I am not doing what I am meant to do. I do not enjoy my life as it is. I am taking courses to prepare me for a life as a Mechanical Engineer. Now I realize that I do not want to do that. I want something else.   This "something else" is currently unknown to me. I do have a suspicion it relates to my passion for morality, society, politics, and the deeper meaning behind existence. I may seek education in journalism, or writing. Having my own opinion column could be my true calling. I am not sure right now, but I do know now that being an engineer is probably not for me. The endless drudgery of banging out designs or product improvements fills me with dread. I couldn't do that every day. This revelation hit me like a bolt of lightning. I just sat in class, and I suddenly Knew I didn't belong. It wasn't that I didn't understand, but that I was masquerading as a student of a profession I had no interest in. I was lying to myself and to everyone else by being there.  So now I am beginning the process of changing my life. Next week I will talk with a counselor at my school and take some tests designed to pinpoint interests and aptitudes. I am also going to make appointments for discussions with some people in different colleges about a change of major. As I go to a engineering school, I will probably have to transfer to another college. I will update this blog with the news from these efforts.   Thank you Todd for helping me to be honest with myself. I realize it is a rare and precious thing to learn early that what you are doing is not what you should be doing. I hope I can use that knowledge to find my true calling, so that I can enjoy my life from here on out. The hard part is actually breaking away from my current path and heading out into unknown territory. I have a mental block on the pursuit of "soft" disciplines like writing and art. Those are for lesser men. But now I realize in my heart that I want to create something unique, and to bring my own viewpoint and ideas into the world. I can't do that as an engineer. I would be just a cog in the machine. Even if I am nothing more than some insignificant reporter covering Groundhog Day or somesuch I will at least be pursuing what it is I want to do. I want to reach people, to change them. Maybe I am some sort of crusader. Like an idealistic leftist, but without the crooked world-view.  I always thought it was foolish and stupid to try to change the world. That's why most people become journalists. They think they can make the world a better place. Most are crazy leftists infused with socialism. They want to end inequalities and tear down the establishment. I have no such illusions. But it is strange to think I may seek this path.  At this moment I am continuing my classes as they are. I am merely exploring my options for change. It may be that I turn back to what I am doing now. But I doubt that. I find no joy in it now, and I realize I never have. If anyone wants to share their thoughts on the issues of doing what you love, finding your true calling, or can offer any advice to me feel free to post here, comment, or email me.
