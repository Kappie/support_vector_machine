You know, I never thought I'd see the day when lil' Dollface went out and tried the weed. Kinda surprising..tho..not really. I dunno how you managed to kill that high, that's pretty weird, and it sounds like your brother-in-law'd know if it were bad weed. Oh well, maybe some other time you'd get a good high.  Nothin' more than I loveley bore, and what's more I got to eat stuff for this gluttonous, bloody holiday (and I can't spell).  Since I haven't got many words to say, I'll just fill this up with some news you probably could care less about, here we go!  Crapasscartoons'll have some more cartoon up soon, we've got the animations on the drawing board, but Owens does the flash animations and uploads them on the site, and he's like seriously ill, so that's delayed. If you care at all, then just know that that one cartoon isn't gonna be the only one up there forever. And uhh...let's see...what else....oh right.  I have a real problem about that hate mail thing...THERE IS NONE!! Why won't any one send any hate mail?! If you're a little scared about letting me know how much you hate me, don't be! That's what it's there for! If you EVER have a need to express your hatred for me, or for Owens...or I guess even Anar, just send the mail!! C'MON PEOPLE!! SEND ME YOUR HATE!! I NEED TO KNOW YOU HATE ME!!!  Anyway, mid-way through this rant, one of those waves of writing inspiration, or some shit, came through me, Summer calls it "stream of consciousness"? Sure, anyway, I'm bored, so, even though you might not care...well I don't care...    the writing that used to be here was removed for being too stupid    Figure it anyway you want. I'm Deadinside, and I REALLY like cranberries...I leave you with that...  "You've had waaay to much to smoke. I think I see some marijuana growin' out of your ears."
