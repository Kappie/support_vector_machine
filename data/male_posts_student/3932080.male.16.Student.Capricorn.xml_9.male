But two weeks ago, after  Malibu, California  resident  Lydia Graham  was stung by multiple bees, Hoffman came to her rescue and immediately called the police. An allergic reaction ensued, putting Graham in danger of death ("I could [have] possibly died").       After full recovery, a medical examed showed that Graham's allergic reaction was actually to Hoffman, and that the bee stings were just "extra blood to worry about."
