Finally, the will of the people prevail and the greatest TV series in the history of the world is extended beyond the usual ten episodes. Bear in mind that there were hundreds of  Lupin  episodes created in Japan, so the potential for more  Lupin  is extremely high.   On Sunday, we are going to Warped Tour. Just the thought of being four days away from Bad Religion, one of the most influential and relevant punk bands ever formed, makes me shudder with excitement. Not only is  the  BR going to be there, tons of other bands, including Anti-Flag, Flogging Molly, the Casualties, etc are going to be there. It gets better, too. With all the political action/label/band booths, the potential for free stuff is astronomically high. It will be a punk rock baptism of sorts for John and Bryce, who kinda fool around with punk but have never openly declared their undying love for it as I have. Plus, a bunch of other 'punx' I know are going, including the Oselands, Alex, Mike, and Nate.  Tomorrow is the last day of work for this week, meaning that I can finally get more than five hours of sleep a night.   Last week's monotony, despair, and embarrassment have been replaced with cautious optimism. So hooray for me, because I feel much better.  I guess Sandy is going to become a nurse now, so now at least one provider in that family will have a real job. She pretty much flat out said that it was my fault that she didn't become a nurse, to which I replied that it was her fault I didn't become a emotionally stable person. Just kidding. Didn't want to diminish her newfound motivation.   Today was a pretty day, and even the crazies on the right seemed quiet. So, finding no injustice to fight, I drove on down (or is that up?) to the Oselands for some swimming. As soon as I entered Nisswa, it started to rain. So, we played Halo and ate pizza, which was okay in itself but no substitute for Nisswa Lake, which shined a deep blue as I drove past, cursing the weather.  Yeah, like John, I haven't accomplished anything this summer. I didn't set any specific goals at the beginning, other than some vague promises to start thinking clearer and not overexamine things. Well, that didn't pan out, so I decided that pissing my days away probably had some interesting life lessons if I looked close enough. Sure enough, there they were, as soon as I stopped caring.  You can reach Derby's blog at http://no-pancakes.blogspot.com. I'll update the link tomorrow, if I remember.  Tomorrow I have to load some stuff into Beatbox, and go to a movie or something.   Well, I'm about through for tonight.  Ra.
