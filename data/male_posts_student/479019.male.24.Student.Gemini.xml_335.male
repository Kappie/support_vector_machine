I was on campus at 9:20 AM... until 5:30 PM... Prof. West no-showed due to the weather... of course Keyder had to be around so I couldn't just go home.  I talked to Richard and he gave me some ideas about how to fit historical materialism into my  Blockade  paper. He's a smart guy and was really helpful. I find that I'm doing lots of reading that isn't for my classes...  Last night I also managed to get some more painting done...  That's pretty much it... I don't know what to do about tomorrow. If it's snowing, I doubt Prof. Elbert will be treking down from Ithaca for class... then again if I need to pick something up from the library tomorrow. We'll see how the weather is.  Now playing... some  Johnny Cash   ***
