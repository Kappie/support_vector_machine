They're always telling me I'm too hateful and angry, and they're so damn nosy. Searching my room, always looking at me suspiciously. I know it's only because they care about me, but I can't help but feel annoyed and slightly pissed off.  Anyway....I got a phone call from someone I didn't even know today. It was....weird. She knew who I was, but I had no idea who the fuck she was. =\ The conversation went something like this... Me: *picks up* Hello? Her: Is Angela there? Me: This is her. Her: Oh hi! This is blah blah blah. (Note: she didn't really say "blah blah blah", but I was distracted and didn't hear what her name was) Me: Ummmmm....hi Her: Do you know me? Me: ....I don't think so.... Her: I'm one of Olympia's friends. Me: Oh, cool Her: Have you seen me? Me: ......I don't think so.... Her: Oh. Are you going to Timpview? Me: Yeah... Her: Cool. I might go. Do you know anyone that's going there? Me: Errrr...just some of the people from our school. Her: Oooh, do you know blah blah blah? (Can't remember who she said) Me: No.... Her: What about Cecelia? Do you know her?  Me: No.... Her: Do you know blah blah blah? (you get the point) Me: no.... Her: dang, you don't know any of the people Olympia hangs out with! Me: Heh. Her: Do you know Cruz? Me: Yeah.... Her: Cool. You know Javier right? Me: Yeah..... Her: *launches into long story about how Javier is moving to Springville* Me: Fun. I know people who live there. Her: Cool. Are you Mexican? Me: No.... Her: I always thought you were Me: Nope, sorry. Her: Are you Mormon? Me: No.... Her: Are you Catholic? Me: No.... Her: So you're nothing, eh? Me: I suppose you could say that... Her: Well, I have to go! Me: Bye. o.o  God. That was an awkward conversation. Considering that I had no idea who she was, and all. I hope she didn't think I was rude. ^^;;;;  Ugh, anyway, I'm off to post in my LJ, then study for my English exam (WHY ME?! *screams at the sky). Night all.
