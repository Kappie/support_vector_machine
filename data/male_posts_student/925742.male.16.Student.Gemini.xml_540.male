After work (mmmm  great wall express), I went to the mall and went through the painless  task of obtaining my license  Which I now have.   Yep, a  car and a license are mine now.  Woot!  And I just got back  from a kickass free 311 concert!      Ok, well time to end this baby.      Oh wait.      80% of the girls there were super hot, and it reminded me of how much  of a loser I am because... you know, I'll never get laid or anything in  high school.      MEH!
