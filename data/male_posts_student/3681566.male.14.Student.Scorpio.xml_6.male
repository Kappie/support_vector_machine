Lost in Translation for me, Leader in Training for everybody else. This is the first of two steps to becoming a qualified counciler for the City Daycamp programs! I have volunteered the past two years for the City of London and also the YMCA. My aim is to become a teacher when I am older, so hopefully this will help me accomplish this goal!  Well, I haven't been on the net for about 2 days now. I have only been on for about 30 min/day. Scary for me. I just sorta ran out of things to do. Temporarly that is.  Mike
