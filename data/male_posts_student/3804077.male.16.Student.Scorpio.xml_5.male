My girlfriend's best friend's brother and cousin got into a car accident earlier today, I wanted to put that along with my sorrow and hope for them not to be injured to badly. I'm sitting here, and if any of you who are reading this IRC, then you should know about mIRC. Well now I want to make a bot thats like a casino and crap, but at the moment I'm too lazy. And of course I got a girlfriend but she's not online so I'm pretty damn lonely.. *misses her* I don't know what else to put so I will just leave this where it is and come back later to add another one. LaterZ. *poof*
