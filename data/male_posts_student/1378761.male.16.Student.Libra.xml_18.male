Monday I went to a herbal/psychic lady as I call her in Fort Recovery. She looked into my eyes and said she can she all kinds of things. She said as was in some kind of traumatic accident in my life. I don't know what she is talking about. She did see that Josh had his tail bone hurting, that he did like 4 days ago sledding. So I dunno if she is right or not. I guess you just have to belief in it.   So I took the whole day off from school. I need the break. I went with Josh and we followed his uncle and grandparents up. I never really knew how small Fort Recovery was. But I did stop in at Fort Recovery High School to drop off a letter to Tim's cousin there. I said I was comming to Fort Recovery, but I always say that so she didn't believe me (now she will, lol)  Can you believe the price of gas?!! Its getting a little outrageous. Oh good news. Finally got my car starter on and working (Many thanks to Doug Axe - Audio Sound and Entertainment)  Ok so I am starting on a diet again. This time I am limiting what I eat for lunch. I dunno if it is going to work. I also bought the last supply of slimfast bars from Big Bear (They were going out of business so they were really cheap)  That's about it for now. I will cya around!! @#Eric#@
