It seems that Bush now has his own sex scandal on his hands, but this one involves some pretty weird stuff.  This is from the guy who said that he would restore honor and dignity to the Oval Office.  I just read that he is going to  make a prime-time speech on Monday night.  Its going to be about Iraq.  Yesterday the US raided the compound of Ahmad Chalabi, who took us into this war and was being paid by the Pentagon up until a few days ago.  Now he is denouncing the US administration there and is pushing for full sovregnity for Iraq.  This is the guy who said that we would be welcomed in Baghdad with flowers and candy.  It now has been revealed that he was spying for Iran.  He could have given them secrets that led to the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq.
