They argue that this is not a win for terror, but I can't understand how they arrive at that conclusion.  THey call the election a 'summons to join Europe and the United States in the kind of intense and broadly based cooperation that can provide the most sustained and effective answer to the tragedy of Madrid.'    Did John Kerry write this??
