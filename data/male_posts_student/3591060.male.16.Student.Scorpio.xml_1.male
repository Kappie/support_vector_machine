As before, you can load a hand-holding maintenance wizard that runs through the most essential checkup tasks -- leftover file and Internet cache cleanup, Registry pruning, the spyware checker, and disk defragmentation -- or set up a scheduler for unattended maintenance.   Today's hard disks are huge enough that a little flotsam and jetsam is less of a problem than before, but the new version retains System Mechanic's industrial-strength search and removal tools for outdated and invalid shortcuts, temporary files or other application debris, Add/Remove Programs uninstall listings, and space-wasting duplicate files. Ditto for orphaned Registry entries, with options to compact and back up the entire Registry or, for the hardcore, take system snapshots for manual removal surgery after installing programs or drivers that go bad.   And System Mechanic 4 can defragment your hard disk, reuniting scattered pieces of files for optimum performance; Iolo boasts that its proprietary 'Caterpillar' engine is the ultimate defragger, but while it certainly struck as as faster and more flexible than Windows' built-in utility, we wouldn't rate it above Executive Software's dedicated, somewhat pricey Diskeeper.
