    
       I'm reasonably excited about going home on Monday (but note duly that I won't be in school until Tuesday since I'm getting home at like 5 pm).  Mr. Stanley got my postcard and read it to the class, so there's hope that the other three people to whom I sent postcards will get theirs too.  One of those, who can be very melodramatic at times, told me that she loved getting mail, and I agree- mail is so much funner to receive than most anything else.  Well, that's about it.  Oh yeah, and I'm sure there'll be more quotes once I'm back in ol' Jewton.
