One major downfall though is that I have had sunburn on my shoulders. I couldn't move very much without feeling pain. The burning went away and now it's all pealing. My skin is dry so when my shirt gets moved around it hurts for a bit. Sleeping is a pain. I guess I am somewhat out of order.  I miss some stuff about home. I love to play games and I am a big fan of the  urlLink Warp Pipe Project.  I left my Gamecube and Broadband Adapter at my house. If I come back this summer I will be bringing that along with Mario Kart: Double Dash!! because my sister has cable and I will be able to get a good game going. We don't have cable available in our area yet. MediaCom has it available in the city but we have our house in the country so we have to resort to low-grade DSL. It does the job, I guess.  I am going home later today. In a way it sucks but really, it isn't that bad. I was on a trip in Washington DC for a week. Then I came back home for three days and then came down here for a week. I haven't seen much of home.  Well, I don't have much more to say! I just want to emphasize how cool  urlLink Warp Pipe  is and how everyone should look at  urlLink Warp Pipe  instead of nasty XLink. The  urlLink Warp Pipe Revolution  is near and you should check out  urlLink the Warp Pipe Forums  to find a download of Test Builds of the Megaton, also known as  urlLink Warp Pipe v0.4.
