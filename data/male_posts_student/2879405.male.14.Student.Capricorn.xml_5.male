We thrashed Woodland Ring 25:5. what a score!!We Played our 1st match and did this good job.I pitched for the 1st -3rd inning before being substitued by Gary finishing the game. My 1st inning was perfect man! I strike 2 out and tag one out. My 2nd inning wasnt as good but my 3rd was bad. I let in 5 runs by giving pitches that were low and runner from three could come in. It was because of this then i was taken over by gary who did a good job. I have to hao lian cause i don't keep my good thoughts in my heart.
