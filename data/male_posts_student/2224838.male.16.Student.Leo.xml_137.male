As he was talking about pull-over procedures, I was reminded of something that happened about a year ago while my family and I were visiting our cousins in Oklahoma.  It was May and the weather was nice, so my brothers, sister, cousin, and my cousin's girlfriend decided to go to a park and play some croquet. We all piled into my cousin's car, with the croquet equipment and my sister in the back hatch, and drove off to the park. For some reason, my cousin decided to drive without his shoes, but we didn't have any trouble getting to the park. It was a rousing game of croquet that we all played, and I came from behind in the end to win the game.   After having so much fun, we all piled back into the car and started for my cousin's house. About a block from his house, a black  white pulled out from behind some trees along the road, turning its sirens on and pulling us to the side. Everyone in the car fell silent, as we began to think of all the marks against us. Not only was my cousin speeding, but he was without shoes, had expired tags, and my sister was in the back of the car without a seatbelt, cuddled up with a bunch of croquet equipment. It must have been a hilarious scene for the two officers, as they walked up alongside the car.   One of the officers walked to the back of the car and tapped on the window, as my sister stared back at him, surrounded by mallets and balls, while the other officer approached my cousin and asked for his license. As the officers continued to examine the car, noting the expired tags, the girl in the back without a seatbelt, and the absence of my cousin's shoes, they seemed to be rather amused. To the surprise of everyone in the car, however, the officers simply gave my cousin a warning and had him put on his new tags (which were in the glovebox the entire time).   As we drove off, we couldn't help but laugh at the whole ordeal. And let's just say that my great croquet win was brushed aside by the experience.
