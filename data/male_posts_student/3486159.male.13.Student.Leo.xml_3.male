I even looked at stocks (yes, I  am  that pathetic...) I have no idea what to do.  My momma always told me that intelligent people never get bored...  So... I'll think of something to do... Oooh! I'll go find a chain letter thing where it asks you a lot of questions and fill it out, and post it here for the whole world to see!! YEAH!! I am so fucking intelligent.
