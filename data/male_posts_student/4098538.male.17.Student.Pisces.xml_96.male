I called her up and asked where she was going tomorrow with one of her friends (who I happen to despise). Apparently, this is 'starting an argument'. All I did was ask where she was going. I mean... yeah, I have a hard time trying to handle the fact that she is gonna be spending the day with a guy who is a complete twat to his girlfriends (this guy happens to like Amanda), but what guy wouldn't be the same about his girlfriend? It's just human nature to be a bit paranoid and cautious. Well anyway - this raised a whole conversation about trust and how she doesn't trust me and how she never can. I don't see how. I'm not the one meeting girls and going to the cinema with them,  alone!  She claimed that I don't trust her for not knowing what would happen with them both tomorrow. I am right to have slight doubts. It just seems weird that she plans to meet this guy when we break up.  Anyway, I just wish she thought about all of this before asking me back in the nicest way ever last night. It seems she repeatedly puts me through hell. But it isn't as bad as it was last time. I went through all the pain I could possibly bare the last time she did this to me. I'm not gonna moap around this time or chase after her. It's over.   For good.
