I got down at Purnea Chowk and took an auto-rickshaw to Hazratganj. The courier office was at Ansal City Centre. From the name of the plaza, it sounded like this would be a posh place, but it was a rather dilapidated structure on inside streets. Luckily, the auto-rickshaw driver knew the location. I picked up the big box and came back to IIM in the same auto-rickshaw.        What's more interesting is my first real glimpse of Lucknow. Some important points:   Lucknow is not very large, it seemed to me. The mentality is also a small-town one, and the pace is very slow. Existence of cycle rickshaws as means of transport illustrates this.  There doesn't seem to be any municipal transport service. Local means of transport are auto-rickshaws, cycle rickshaws, converted tempo-travellers and the larger cars filled to bursting capacity.  On the way to Hazratganj, I came across around three parks which seemed well-maintained and good.  Most of the advertisement hoardings were about establishments in a few areas only - Hazratganj, Aliganj, Shivaji Road, M. M. Malviya Marg, Nishatganj, Indiranagar, etc.  A very large proportion of the hoardings belonged to teaching and coaching insitutes. This included preparatory classes for IIT-JEE and PMT, as well as State board exams. Another very common hoarding message was ' Angrezi bolanaa siikhiye ', by establishments called 'British Insitute of Languages' and 'American Center for Languages'.   I crossed and re-crossed a bridge over the Gomti river. As it flows through the city, it is very narrow, compared to, say, Sabarmati. But it has quite a bit of water. As usual, there are slum settlements on its banks.  Near the Ansal City Centre were several biryani and kebab shops, named ' Dastarkhwan ', ' Naushijaan ', etc.  I also passed by the K. D. Singh 'Babu' stadium, the huge offices of the Geological Survey of India and many colleges.          This was as much as I could get a glimpse of today. Hopefully, I will be able to visit in a more leisurely manner immediately after the mid-term exams get over next weekend.
