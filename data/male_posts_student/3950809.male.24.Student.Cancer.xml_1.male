I'm bored and what else can I do?  What else do people with spare time do except blog, right? Join the  club I said.      Anyway, I have no real idea how this looks. I have no idea how to  change the look of my blog. I think it's HTML or something... Don't  think I'll improve myself by learning how to use it. I'll just focus on  one thing now...      Well, term starts in 1 week. Can't say that I'm looking forward to it.  I think it'll be exciting but very tough. Will be doing my surgical  rotation at Geelong for 5 weeks. I don't know how I'm going to wake up  at 6.30am just to be at the handover (handover of patients by the  overnight staff) at 7am. It's crazy! I think I'd need 3 alarms. Also  just found out that my days will be rather long... as long as an  intern. We'll basically be shadowing them throughout their shift.  That's about 10 hours a day. Maybe longer if we have tutes at the end  of the day. I guess it's about time I start training myself waking up  at an ungodly hour. How will I survive next year? :S *sigh*      Can't wait till the results of the matching process are released. 9th  of Aug. Applied for internship in Vic and WA and the results of my  application (along with every other full-fee-paying student who  applied) will be released on the above date. WA will take a little  longer. If all goes well (and God shows His favour upon me!), I may  just get a job offer... We'll see.
