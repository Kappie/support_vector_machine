Whatever happened to that subject we were talking about noon?  I've already watched Kill Bill Volume 1. I like the sword scenes. They aren't as gory as Kenshin's movies so I didn't puke or anything.   My sister probably knows more about violence and pornography than me. She lives in the wordly metro.  Soul Assembly? You just love to put souls in your titles, don'cha? Why when you don't accept souls to exist without any proof?  Don't consider drugs. Consider this, if it makes you better at what you do, you will doubt yourself and what you would have been capable without it. If it makes you worse, it makes you worse.  Ok.
