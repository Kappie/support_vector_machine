There wasn't a single actual plan presented, and from what I've heard, the Democrats worship Plans.  Without a Plan, you are nothing.  Pelosi was like a robot.  My favorite conclusion from her portion of the speech was the concept that we will defeat the terrorists through inspections.  We will crush them beneath the wheels of organization and communications.    Quote -  Democrats have a better way to ensure our homeland security.   One-hundred percent of containers coming into our ports or airports must be inspected. Today, only 3 percent are inspected. One-hundred percent of chemical and nuclear plants in the United States must have high levels of security. Today, the Bush administration has tolerated a much lower standard.   One-hundred percent communication in real time is needed for our police officers, firefighters and all our first responders to prevent or respond to a terrorist attack. Today, the technology is there, but the resources are not. One-hundred percent of the enriched uranium and other material for weapons of mass destruction must be secured. Today, the Administration has refused to commit the resources necessary to prevent it from falling into the hands of terrorists.   America will be far safer if we reduce the chances of a terrorist attack in one of our cities than if we diminish the civil liberties of our own people.   End Quote.  Daschle isn't much better.  Under his reasoning, tax cuts cause people to flee the nation.  Quote -   The massive tax cuts that were supposed to spark an economic expansion have instead led to an economic exodus.   End Quote  And the juciest line of them all -  Quote  -  America can't afford to keep rewarding the accumulation of wealth over the dignity of work.   End Quote.  Excuse me Sen. Daschle, but what do you think WORK is?  Do you understand that wealth is what DRIVES this economy?  This phrase betrays the fundamental moral fissure that is the Leftist mentality.  Wealth is bad, work is good.  Therefore the only path to sainthood is to labor without accumulating wealth.  That's called 'peasentry', and I don't recommend it as a national policy.  Really, I'm beyond a coherent argument here.  It is as fundamental as the sky is blue.  Daschle isn't stupid, he knows this.  But to sit there and utter it to the people like it is a sacred truth is just amazing.  Read on, there's plenty more.
