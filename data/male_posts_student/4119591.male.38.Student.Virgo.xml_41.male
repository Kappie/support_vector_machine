According to Apple, they feature longer battery life and the ability to vary the playback speed of audio books.  The new units are slightly less expensive ($$ per Megabyte) than the second generation players. This is a good thing considering that the iTunes Music Store has made the 9/11 hearings available for free  urlLink download  in 36 files. All freedom-loving Americans everywhere will want to review every syllable of these exciting investigatory hearings. Armed with one of these new iPods, you'll have the necessary storage to collect all of the hearings and you will be able to play them back at high speed to impress your friends!
