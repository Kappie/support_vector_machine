But, yes, Sophia, you are so hot it literally burns.  Good thing i have quite a bit of self control.        Ha! I knew nate only went to socrates cafe for the girls!  but once again, i must complain about your topic.  who cares what musicals you want to see? I mean, if you chose one, and talked about it, sure.  But you just have a bloody list! What the shrell? I dont care if thats jonah's word   SQEE!
