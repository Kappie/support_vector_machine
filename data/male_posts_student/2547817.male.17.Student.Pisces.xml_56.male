I want to talk about yesterday. Yesterday, I went for debate training to help with what little I could. Zel was there and we didn't talk at all. I got sad again. Went to conference with Angeline at West Mall after doing the proposition's case up nicely on the white board. She was busy and her boss was due soon, so I left without saying much, with her beckoning me to return, I walked out.  Took a 173 up to Zel's hill and walked up in a drizzle. Halfway up, it began to rain, as in really rain, but I still walked up the hill. Why the hell right? I reached her house and stood across the road under a tree, drenched and dazed for 10 minutes. Not like the tree helped much, but I did it on impulse anyway. The leaves were in my hair. It was young. We were young; are young. Reminisce.  10 minutes I stood there blank. Looked down to get water out of my hair and her father was in the doorway staring at me when I looked up. I walked casually off and sweared casually as I turned the corner at the hill's inflexion junction. I walked down slowly, dripping, but feeling less burdened than before.  I am burdened again. I want her back but I can't. It's not the right time. I did it with a reason. Till then,   Good things come to those who wait.
