I ordered the new eagles of death metal album, i found out new qotsa ep comes out april 20th, i got incubus tics, finally got around to buying the vines' cd (very good btw, listening to it right now), i played dnd for 9 hours (dear god i need a life), my bass teacher told me "you really need to find a band to play in, you could totally kick ass if you wanted", and um well i suppose that's it....oh yeah a Georgia Tech better kick some ass and win bc they are going all the way! i hate basket ball btw but my love for any and all college sport out weighs my hate for basketball.  -mike
