I wouldn't wear them until he came back in protest to the war. Now he is home, so I can wear them. I'm thinking of taking them with me to England. Good idea? Bad idea? Dunno. We will see. As for the new site, it is in the works. I'm uploading pictures and editting the last few sections. I'm still learning how to use XML, so that is what is taking so long. But the site should be up today or tomorrow. I like the site as it is, but I feel like a new site design is in order, since I'm not gonna be able to update the site when I'm in England. I will try and post what I can when I'm over there, but I don't even know when I'm gonna get time to do that. Plus it would be at an Internet Cafe, and we all know that paying for the internet sucks. lol.
