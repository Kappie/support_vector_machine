Since my brother has been too busy to help me, and since he had to leave for work before I could ask him tonight, I eventually found the answer to my problem by looking at Darian's style sheet using the CSS sidebar in Firefox (probably its main advantage). I found that I needed to use "display: block" to obtain the effect that I wanted, much like the one Darian uses for his side menu. Thanks for the unconscious help Darian.   I also added my friend, Brandon, to my weblogs section again because he finally posted something after about four months (I wasn't even aware that he had a girlfriend). I doubt he will post much again soon, but he is my best friend so he is worthy of the list. Also new to the sidebar is the "MISC. SITES" section, under which there is currently one site. But it's a good site, so check it out.  Elsewhere  Today I submitted my two entries for the  urlLink Kansas Scholastic Press Association  state competition, which I mentioned in a  urlLink past post . Since both entries were carry-ins, I will not be going with the others to the University of Kansas tomorrow (not that I wanted to anyway). I think both entries turned out very well, so I can only hope that I will place with one of the two. If I do happen to place, I will be awarded  what else?  a shiny new medal. For some reason, it doesn't exactly seem fitting for a journalism contest. It seems that a plaque, or perhaps a fancy certificate would be fitting, but who am I to complain? I could just flaunt my nice little medal in front of some athletes.  By the way, the great hockey action of the NHL playoffs, and Darian's encouragement on his blog, has ignited an urge inside of me to play hockey. I don't know if that will really ever happen, but it's a thought at least.
