I have a bunch of thumbtacks, and i hang pictures of cool people on my wall as a border around my closet, but upon moving to my new hous, i find that i'm a) several pictures short, and b) interested in getting rid of some of the pics that are up there at the moment. So, if you're cool, remind me to get some pictures of us having fun. :)
