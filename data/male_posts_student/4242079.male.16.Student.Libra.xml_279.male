In some parts of the world, 2004 has already arrived. And I still have no idea what I'm doing tonight. Nor who with.  Sure, Kylie is coming. But other than that, I'm totally clueless. Ashley might call. Chantelle and Sherri might call. I might call Edward. Who knows. This is what happened last year. Last year was alright, I suppose. Good company, anyway.  Well. This is probably going to be my last entry for the year, so have a good night, don't do anything too stupid.   Happy New Year *blows on party favour noise maker thingy*.
