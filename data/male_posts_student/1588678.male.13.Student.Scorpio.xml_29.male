I mean, Mike Myers got a bit old in that movie. There was a couple of seines that were kinda funny but the rest was horrible. Believe me, if Dr. Suess lived to see this movie he’d die at how much they destroyed the story making it into a movie. I don’t have anything against Mike Myers, he’s one of my favorite actors, but this wasn’t his best film period.   The Cast - Fine to me, wait, oh shit: Alec Baldwin! Mike Myers was well so-so. He’s great in all his other movies. He kinda got annoying after 10 minutes which added a lot of crappiness to the film. Everyone knew that when they were gonna make Cat in the Hat into a movie, the one to play Cat would either be Jim Carrey or Mike Myers. The kids in the movie weren’t that bad. I don’t think they’ll make it very far, but they were good. Kelly Preston was, I guess okay. She only had like 4 parts in the movie. And Alec Baldwin, I ain’t goin there man!   Upside of The Film - The town they built for the movie was real cool. It’s this town in the middle of these lush-green valleys and everyone drives a yellow or green Ford Focus. Every house is purple. They really did a good job of making the town look like the one from the book. Along with the town they really pulled off creating the Cat. They did real good. Mike Myers was doing this interview on TV and mentioned that being to Cat in the Hat was easy because it took them like 2 hours, but when he did Fat Bastard it took something like 5 hours. One would wonder what it’s like being in a Cat suit or a 1,000 lb. Scottish bastard.   Okay, I give this film ** cause I’m feeling generous today. If you have young children you should take them to see it but if your desperate to see a movie on Sunday like me go see something else. Don’t make the same  mistake I did.
