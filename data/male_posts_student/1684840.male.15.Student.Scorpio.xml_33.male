Can't wait until Friday at 12:35 when we leave the school grounds for 6 long and deserved weeks of rest.  I'm really excited about our 6 week holiday to Texas, which we go on next Wednesday!!!!!!  I've got yet ANOTHER cold and my throat hurts :(  I hope it rains really soon because I've had just about enough of it being sunny, even though I was really bored of seeing rain cloud rain cloud on the weather every day.  I'm off to bed now anyways...
