Our pastor talked about yearning for an "indestructible well-bring of soul" in his message last night, and I think that this is exactly what I've been trying to find.  He used this phrase as a definition of joy, but I think it has so many more meanings to it - joy, contentment, belonging, righteousness, and so many other qualities are wrapped up in the concept of "well-being."  I think that I had this at one time, but I know I don't have it now - my soul feels fragile like an egg-shell, cowering in the corner from all the beatings and bruises its taken (i.e. disappointments, etc.).  All I'm looking for, hoping for, praying for is someone who would actually come alongside me and help me, challenge me, prod me towards the path I need to be on - but of course, this has been a hope for several years now, and I've pretty much given up all hope of it actually happening.  Sometimes I just want to scream during church or when I'm with my Christian friends or something, ask what it is about me that makes people so indifferent about my spiritual well-being.  Is it that I'm too passive?  Seemingly too good (well, I could clear up that misconception real quick...)?  Don't seem to have any problems?  Too "weird," too caught up in the metaphysical aspects of things?  Not committed enough?  Whatever the reason, I just wish that someone would actually care...but I'm not holding my breath.
