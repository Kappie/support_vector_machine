The paramedics knocking on my door at 3am..the ride to and subsequent three hour stay in the ER..the 30 hour stay at Green Oaks..my first visit with the doc..the heart palpitations..the sleepless nights..my best friend deciding she wanted nothing further to do with me, without the slightest attempt at an explanation..that incredible weekend in Vegas..the start of the fall semester. It's been a crazy ride with few ups but plenty of downs.       In just this past month alone I experienced both the highest of highs and the lowest of lows..though of course the lows generally predominated. Aside from the time spent with Grace and that incredible weekend getaway, things have just been downright shitty. No I take that back. Shitty doesn't even begin to describe how fucked up, depressed, and miserable I've been feeling. All in all, t  his experience has  not  made me stronger and it has  not  made me more appreciative of life in general. Do I still want to kill myself? Honestly, yes. Am I going to? I don't know. I feel as if I owe it to Grace to at least try..try to think about our future together and the supposedly better life that awaits.     I truly believe that everything happens for a reason. I just don't know what it is I'm supposed to take from all this. Life's just taken this great big shit on me. What the fuck am I supposed to do now? I can't go on acting as if everything's ok and back to normal because it's not. And I doubt it will be for quite some time. So that's where I'm at right now. I have no fucking clue.
