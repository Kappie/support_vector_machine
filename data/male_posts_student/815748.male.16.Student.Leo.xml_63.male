Along with Lauren Blanchard, I represent Lesotho in the Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee (SOCHUM).  I actually introduced an amendment that passed, pretty good considering how insignificant the country is.  Our topic is the death penalty.  We need to execute a good resolution (ha ha ha... no).  A few anecdotes:  In the car ride there, we were playing this game where we try to name countries that begin with the third letter of the previous country.  I had to do one with "R," and Russia, Rwanda, and Romania had already been said.  All I could come up with was "Roganda," and then I was like, wait a minute...  -Knock knock. -Who's there? -Interrupting cow. -Interrupting c -MOOOOO!  -Knock knock. -Who's there? -Interrupting llama. -Interrupting ll -(Head butt)  There was one motion for a song, that was good.  Also, after a point of personal privilege, the moderator asked, "How many people are hot... and I don't mean physically attractive..."  So I guess you had to be there.  Whadayagannado.  Model UNnecessary.  PS: Loren, you are so dead.
