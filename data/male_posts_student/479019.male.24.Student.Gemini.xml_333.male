Everyone seems to like the question I asked at the talk... which is good. I need to show I'm not all about moshing, staples in my arm, and other crazy shit. I can be academic when I want to be!  Last night... my comp crashed in a bad way and I had to reinstall Windows... that was quite a bitch. So I didn't go to the Belmar as planned. I managed to save my emails, documents, and other important stuff. That's what counts... programs... eh? I don't really use that many programs to begin with.  Today... I plan on going to campus and downloading shit... and then burning back ups. Eventually... I plan on getting an external HD, backing up all that's important, and then formating my old HD.  Oh yea... I finished my Folgers... which means I have some nice Starbucks coffee in my cup right now... that's some tasty shit.  I have  Monster's Ball  to watch tonight if I'm not too drunk after going to Hooters... I think that's still on....  ***
