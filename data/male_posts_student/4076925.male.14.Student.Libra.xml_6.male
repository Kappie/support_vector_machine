I am tired of working my ass of from 9 to 5 and not getting paid, but instead paying them!  It is really hard, and gets really annoying when I could be out having fun somewhere else.  So I am thinking of just quitting and getting a job or something, I really need the money nowadays.  Anyway, Aaron and I went and saw Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle.  It was great, just check out my website for the review of it:   urlLink http://www.freewebs.com/mylifeisupsidedown/
