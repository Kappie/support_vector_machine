Hello everybody. As you can tell from my "ever so suspenseful" introduction to today's post, its storming like mad out there. I am kind of excited too. I love storms. I am the kind of person that will stand outside in the pouring rain until the lightning is very close, then I run inside like a baby because I would prefer to live. I am in the mood to ramble so heres another poetic word from myself:    A passionate kiss, and a gleeful smile, The relationship is there, but in turn is so vile, Acceptance is virtue, but rather profound, The existence is there, so clear and so loud, To ponder the meaning, and distinguish its truth, Can complicate matters, and become quite uncouth, The constriction of thoughts, and feelings both alike, Bring chaos and tribulation, to that of the psyche, With emotions and concepts, coming from the heart of a child, I looked into your eyes; and in turn,  you smiled.    Â© 2004 Tyler Kuhk   I am beginning to love my interest in poetry. I am noticing more and more how I can type from the heart and at the same time explain my thoughts in some sort of a "fictional" way. I can honestly say though, I have been inspired by so many people in that of what I do. Michelle Nicol (who's like my big sister) is my judge when it comes to a new piece I write, I always have to check with her before posting it :) I love you for your inspiration Michelle.  The posts I noticed are getting more less about my days, and more about my contemplations. This could probably be a good thing because there's actually something decent (I think anyway) to read rather than to read about my daily adventures in Thunder Bay (Ya, right).  Anywho, I am out for the night. I downloaded some more movies to watch (:O Illegality :P) so I suppose I should go and watch them. Leave me some comments to let me know you were here :)  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Bye for now everyone. See you all later.
