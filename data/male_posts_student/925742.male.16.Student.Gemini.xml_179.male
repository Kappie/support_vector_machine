Well, I cleaned up with the AK47 and the benelli m3 pumpo!  In all but one of the tournament matches, I had the high score of my team!  If you wanna see for yourself and make sure I don't lie, talk to WrathS 01 on AIM.  Oh, and I won a Dawn poster.  Yippie.  I mean I freakin own an ATI gfx card!  Get it right people!
