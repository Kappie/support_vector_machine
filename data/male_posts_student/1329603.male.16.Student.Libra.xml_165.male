Les Mis went pretty well (although I wanted to do the second act so I could show off my writing-the-letter-in-Les-Mis skills, and we only did Act 1 >_  Still on Les Mis subject, but I had to swap paragraphs so people know what I'm saying. Anyway, Susie (Fantine) and I (Bamatbois) spent about 20 minutes at least working out what we're doing at the Docks scene. So, we've gone from me basically molesting her to me getting slapped and kicked. Hoorah. Nah, it seems to work. I had a criticism in that I was singing too fast... one of the first criticisms I've had, apart from "Don't be too violent in Empty Chairs". But still, hoorah. Got a week 'til it comes round again though... *counts hours*  Ohohoh, N'omi (Cosette) phoned me ^_^. Apparently she phoned last night too, but I was out at John Y's memorial. She phoned when I was asleep, and then I had a shower and phoned her back. About half an hour conversation ^_^. That were fun, doesn't happen very often.  Anyways, yes... non-Les Mis related things... Got CYB concert tomorrow and then Gigi till Saturday, so I'm a bit, as the Jamie Oliver people say, chocka. Seriously, I'll be lucky if I blog once between Monday and Friday during next week. Can't fit conversation into hectic schedule. I still love you all though.  Quote of the day: "I had a dream my life would be So different from this hell I'm living, So different now from what it seemed... But life has killed the dream I dreamed."  From   I Dreamed a Dream   from   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly
