Also,they have 2mb l3 cache,512kb l2 cache , so that accounts to 2.5mb cache(we all know that intel cpus don't have much l1 cache,so that is neglible).  Amd officially announced that the prices of the amd athlon xp will be raised from 10-30% depending upon the model and the prices of the amd 64 to go down by the same , globally.
