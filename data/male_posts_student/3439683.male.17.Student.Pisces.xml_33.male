One of the few people outside her family. I'm glad she does. If anyone reads this, please, pray for her. I want her to be able to live life without having to hide her heart behind an armor shell. I want her to know what being loved, and loving, is like, to know what it's like to be surrounded by friends that you trust completely. I was once like her, before Sept. 2003. Now, I know what all that is like, and I would NEVER go back. I want her to be able to see what life is like beyond the armor. I think I know now why she's not interested in getting into any relationships with guys....probably doesn't trust them, because her dad has broken so many promises. I hope she gets past that, and learns what it's like to have that love. heck, I wanna know what that love is like. DAMN!!!!! forgot to save it! it's a conspiracy! I guess my posts on here will have to serve as my notes on the conversations. I need to get Jen in on this....she's our only close mutual female friend. gotta get that perspective. You know, when I'm helping people, I feel better. I don't have to focus on my own problems. It was that way at the forensics camp. I was talking to Stephani about her probs with her boyfriend (now ex), and that was one of the few times when I was completely free of my depression. I'm going bowling tomorrow, hope I did as good as I did last week. 176, 189, 182, that's last week's scores. then I'm going pawnshopping with Jordan. Hopefully there's some good deals out there.
