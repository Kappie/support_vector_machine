It felt soo nice to have him there to listen and to talk to me about things.. it was soo nice, then we went back to the house and I got to play with Dillon and Eathan.. imma scare you.. ROOOAAAAAAARRRRRR!.. that was Eathan he is soo cute.. he was a little skitish around me until I started to tickle him then he got used to me. *snort* HEHE that is just too funny.. well I am going to go now.. but yesterday was great and then his family came and met my family.. his dad said that I was just as talented as my "mother-in-law" that made me laugh.. oh well ttyl byes ~Donna~
