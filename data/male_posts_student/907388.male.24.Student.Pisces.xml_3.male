Last week we had a meteor strike in Orissa.  Well it was huge, really huge. Imagine this, it is evening (around 6:30 pm) and suddenly the sky goes white. What would be you reaction? A fire cracker or maybe the ubiquitous electric transformer bursting perhaps. But what would you think, if your friend in another city, about 40kms away also saw the same thing at the same moment…. Actually that is exactly what happened. I was talking to my friend in another city when all of a sudden we see the sky turning white. We immediately knew that it was surely some kind of meteor strike. I remember waiting for the sound of the impact, but there was none. Later we learned that what we had seen had been the meteor entering the Earth’s atmosphere. It traveled about 200 kms within moments and landed at a place called Mayurbhanj, gutting a few houses. Apparently, no one was killed, but some folks were knocked out by the sound blasted. So that was some excitement in an otherwise mundane week. And by the way, India beat Pakistan in the Asian Cup hockey finals. Now THAT’S always a reason to celebrate.
