I went to church, which was exhillarating... I do love singing in church, it gives one an excuse to belt out loud hymns in a a large room and not be stared at too much as everyone else is doing the same. What's funny is listening to the old men with really deep booming voices singing the traditional hymns as if they were the national anthem, with their hands on their hearts, staring at the cross, with tears streaming down their faces... I like going church also as I don't do it enough, it feels special, when I do, like God recognizes my presence, that I am being absolved my many sins... I'm sure thats the whole point... but thats  not  the point...hehe!    All I wanted to do after that was to go home and play Runescape and chat on MSN, but  NO , mum had to go to the shops.. so as a punishment I said I wanted to drive, the bad news, I didnt crash, or kill anyone... which makes a change from my usual 3 blocks of people massacred and 38908 car pile-ups.  Staring my new job tomorrow. Erk. Early start, and its my bloody  HOLIDAY!  Nuts...      So Iguess I'd better get some rest     Dxx    Hope this makes up for my lack ofproper posting yesterday... not that anyone other thanme is reading this really.
