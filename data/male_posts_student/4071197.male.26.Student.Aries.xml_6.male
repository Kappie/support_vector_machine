It argues that a decentralized information system is the best alternative in the case of a terrorist attack or other forms of disaster.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * In times like this, where computer crime seems to be a sport and a terrorist attack could happen every day, a decentralized information system might be the best way to protect a company from disasters. After the attack on September 11, financial institutions are thinking about making their trading networks and their information systems less vulnerable to disasters. Decentralized systems, such as those used by electronic communications networks ECN, did have the least problems, and actually were intact after the attack. Centralized networks however were destroyed and it took quite a while to get them working again, not to mention all the lost data. Steven Randich, CIO at Nasdaq Stock Market Inc, explains that the best way to secure the information systems is not to harden a single point, but not to provide one point of vulnerability. Giving these circumstances companies should rethink the cost cutting advantage of a centralized IS, in comparison to the effect a terrorist attack or even computer virus can have on such a system.
