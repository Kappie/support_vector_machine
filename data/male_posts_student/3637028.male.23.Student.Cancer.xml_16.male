The decision was down to two, but this one had five bedrooms and a pool, which they had promised to my siblings. The closing date is August 24, the house I'm in now closes August 16. I'm not sure how this is going to work but it looks like we're going to have to live in my dad's two room apartment for a week or go on vacation or something. I have yet to hear about being accepted into any schools down there yet so I'm not sure what I'll be doing once I'm down there. Might just have to get a real job and join the monotony of the corporate world.
