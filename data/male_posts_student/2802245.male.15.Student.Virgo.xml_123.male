Do NOT expose yourself to the face of Tony Blair, even on television, as it may trigger a very bad reaction. *Cue dead ringers music*  Right...deadline...I'm working on my flash, Wanderers, Episode 1. Finished the first half of it, which is nothing but music, movement and random talk. But the latter half is full of fighting. Rhue against four Lyn...who will win? Well...programming the fighting's gonna be hard...so many sound effects to add in as well as blood splatter. Meh...but if I can't get it done, well, my article will have to do.  I shall now beam myself back to my comphy computer chair...peace.  Tull,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
