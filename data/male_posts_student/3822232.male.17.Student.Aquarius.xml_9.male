(as in the pres election and as a result everything got postponed).. yea.. talked to Mr. Choe, gotta refine a bit..  hw.. not so much le.. really hope i can start revising and preparing for promo.. but apparently there are sooooooooo many thing to be done.. haix.. bzbz.. pw as well.. time consuming and not easy. =/  gg back to work.. have to send pw things to qiqi and let him to print.. thx a lot ya~ =)  best wishes to everyone and hope niuZ knows how to take care of herself..
