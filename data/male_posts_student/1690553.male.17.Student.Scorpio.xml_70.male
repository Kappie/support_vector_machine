Please leave your messages at 'Comments' under each post or email or contact via Yahoo Messanger. Pranksters beware, HaloScan records your IP address and the time of posting. I can ban abusive commenters and track their location augumented with data from Nedstat. For those good guys, sorry for the inconvenience. The board got out of control. Does anyone know any tagboard services that can ban abusive commenters?
