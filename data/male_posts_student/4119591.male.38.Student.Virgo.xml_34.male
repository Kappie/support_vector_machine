Music Television ( urlLink MTV ) which, until about ten years ago played music videos, occasionally finds time to play them between reality shows such as  urlLink The Real World ,  urlLink Cribs , and  urlLink The Osbournes . The new pop sensation that all the kids are raving about this week is  urlLink Fountains of Wayne  and MTV will be airing their new video periodically (between commercials for sneakers and "news" breaks). Problem is, they won't be airing the video the way Fountains of Wayne made it; they have removed some objectionable material.   This isn't entirely surprising since the network regularly alters videos to fuzz out corporate logos, obscene gestures and (one would presume) Janet Jackson's right breast should her wardrobe malfunction again. What happened this time is that, according to this associated press  urlLink report :   Fountains of Wayne made a video for the song "Mexican Wine" that originally showed twin ten-year-old girls jumping up and down saying they were going to perform "'Mexican Wine' by Fountains of Wayne!"  The girls are no longer seen uttering the words "Mexican Wine" presumably because ten-year-olds are much too young to be talking about wine. I thought that maybe they could just get around this by saying that the song is actually entitled "Mexican Whine" thereby removing the drug reference.   Whine not? "Wardrobe Malfunction" worked pretty well the last time.
