The director has some funny ideas this play is gonna be hilarious. Other than the fact that i am performing with a professional theatre, there are two girls there who well, seem to be worth getting to know, especially since one is going to be a sophmore at the C of C next year.(Yes im going for the older women that way when i fail i have an explanation lol) anywho i had to drive through some crap storm on the way home i dont like driving in storms but its funny how something so violent can be so soothing just to sit on your front porch and watch. Its poetry in motion and it soothes the most inner depths of my soul just to watch (wish there would have been more storms a month or so ago lol) There are hardly any big storms around here lately so when one does come you have to hold on to the memory as long as possible. The disturbing cracking of the thunder, the shimmering of the lightning, and the sweet sound of the rain on my window. This is a language that is innate in all beings.
