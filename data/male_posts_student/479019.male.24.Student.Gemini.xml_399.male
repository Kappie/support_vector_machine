       
      I just took out the trash, and did some tidying up of my place.  I've got about 100 more pages of du Bois to read...  I wanna finish watching Pi so I can mail it back to NetFlix tomorrow.  I need groceries... I don't think I'll be able to get any until Tuesday.  I also need to talk to friends to see what they're doing and call cousins about spring break.  **
