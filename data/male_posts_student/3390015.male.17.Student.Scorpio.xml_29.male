Check out the video clips, which are actually entire shows [might have to enter the high speed site].  Kirk Cameron is the man in my opinion, and I love to see people who are or used to be in the public light that are men and women of God.  Let me tell you, Hollywood is the most liberal place on Earth, God doesn't factor in to 99% of these people [+-3%...jk], and they may fool you by saying they have faith, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out they aren't sincere. So, it's good to see a star [Growing Pains - duh!] that has true and real faith in God and has decided to share that faith and be vocal about it!
