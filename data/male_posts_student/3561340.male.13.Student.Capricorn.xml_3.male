If you havent seen it already, it said:  first of all i think u should b mad at urself y did u throw the bagel and i think if u honestly did not push robbie y would heather lie about it?? that makes me question some ppls character and oh yea don't trust lesbians if in fact the group u give that title to is in fact of a homosexual nature other than that this is stupid and i'm the only one who reads it nice line witht he FUCK YOU as beautiful as alissa  Unfourtunatley, I dont kno who made that post, but it is complete bullshit. To answer the first part: By the time Ben, Connor, and I came over, about 12 people had been throwing stuff at Robbie. We joined in. So its not like I was doing anything that no one else was doing. And the reason Heather lied about it was becuase she had kicked Robbie in the area where most men have thier balls. She knew if she helped to cover Robbie that he, in return, would not tell on her. The second part is flat out retarded and everyone knows that I refer to all girls that piss me off as lesbians or dykes. However, Im not using the words in thier literal meaning, and you should be able to realize that by the way they are used in the context. Thats all for today.
