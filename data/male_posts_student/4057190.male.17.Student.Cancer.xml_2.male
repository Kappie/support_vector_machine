Shit why the fuck you pressuring the new guy to be superfast on everything if I never even worked there before and I dont even have a week.  Some bitchy manager (who seemed super cool at 1st) tried to blame me for losing her keys. well I did gave them back to her and since i got a good memory i specifically told her where at, the time, and almost made her feel mad dumb. Then she was like "ooh then maybe I might've gave it to some other guy", then after the next 1/2 hr she comes saying that the "other guy" had it. i couldnt tolerate w/ this bullshit anymore, and plus she didnt even appologize for blaming me. so then I decided to quit. I personally dont agree to like work at a place where im not comfortable and that at least lets you select the days that you will be working for. not just some  Radom Days    I really was too ashamed to tell this to  Miriam  because the poor gurl really wanted for me to stay and wanted for us to stay working there. Im too ashamed and embarassed to look at her right in the eye but hey. I prefer not wasting 8hrs everyday of my life doing something that I dont not enjoy doing.  Bad ending  Jay Jay
