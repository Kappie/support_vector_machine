Talked alot with Saleh, Kartik and Suman. Can't believe that Kartik lost his brand new phone. Had to lend him mine which was with Fadzulie. Recess was great. Well, after throwing some ice at those fucking indian keling bitches. They deserve it, don't they? Hope the normal academic soccer team would win this match cause they're playing soccer almost every afternoon. It's a waste if they don't win. Would be having dinner at some posh restaurent called Vanash at Indoor Stadium. Hope it goes smoothly.
