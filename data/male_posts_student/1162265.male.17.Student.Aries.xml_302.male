It was only yesterday (actually Friday, since it's technically Sunday) when trying to figure out what was wrong with my network connection, that my dad realized he needed to fix this computer.  So blah blah blah, 40 some odd hours later, I have XP installed on this computer.  The internet still wasn't up, dad claimed some problems still existed, notably no virus scan! So I waited until he went up to plug in the network cable.  Here I am.  School's out.  Work starts soon.  It'll be alot more serious then last year *sigh*, and I'm working at a camp with freakin' 75 kids.  That'll be stressful, unless that hot girl from last year is working there, then it'll be much less stressful.  On the issue of stress.... Today I had to help down take down our (being me and Nia's) old treehouse.  It was backbreaking work with a reciprocating saw and a ratchet wrench.  He offered to take me to a movie afterward, but that mentally and physically drained me.  I didn't even go to the concert at the Baird Center (no major loss Samone said she was outta town).  So here I am at the moment, tried and about to go to sleep.
