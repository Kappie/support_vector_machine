Everyone just seems to click in the hornline this year, the majority of us are newbies or one year vets, so the whole clique issue isn't there at all. Everyone is chill and gets along...having Sadia and Pat there is interesting, to say the least, but I mean it in the best of ways, I can't wait to tour. We're the cool kids, now. The rooks listen to the vets, and the vets get along, so everything is just bo-handy.  Nope, not sure what "bo-handy" means. But you can take it in context and assume away :)   My favorite memory from this camp? When we randomly all burst into Shotgun, a chord progression. Our favorite chord progession, actually, and it wasn't looking like we were gonna get to play as promised.   Sooo the lead sops devised a plan. As soon as Sean, the caption head was outside with an auditionee, I walked around to inform the vets of the plan, and sent Brookie into the middle of the horn arc to engage the plan.  So, small, wee Brookie stands in the middle of our massive horn arc holding her two hands out in a "bang bang" gesture, our symbol for shot gun. I hold out the B, and others join in. Brooke just tells us when to switch notes, and as we crescendo to the top of the chords, the rookies either jump in, or shut up, so the hornline as one reaches the climax of the progression, climbing the tessatura out of the cacophony of individual instrumentalists to a pure, perfect harmony. As we released, Sean opened the door, and stood silhouetted in the doorframe as the gym held the echo for a good 10, 15 seconds.   We giggled. Sean told us never to do that again. :D  Sorry I wrote the description so corny and poetic...thats just how it hit me. We all laughed, and promised we'd never put the fate of the hornline in Brookie's hands again....but fuck we sounded good. I think I took it up to the D...can't remember...prolly did, but...wow.  Look out East...Blue Devils has a B corps.
