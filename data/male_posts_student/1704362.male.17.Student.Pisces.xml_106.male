This gripping political thriller provides an intriguing and controversial perspective on American culture in post-9/11 society. The improvised narrative (the voice of Mr. Zamboni himself) chronicles the story of Quentin Azara (also played by Zamboni). Quentin, a former Israeli military commando-turned FBI agent struggles to discover a chilling and ancient conspiracy within the upper echelons of the US government, and eventually, discover himself. Watching the interplay between the colorful cast and rich, complex plot is a joy. By the first five minutes, you can be completely absorbed and entranced by the story as it follows Quentin around the globe - from Cairo to Cherynobl. Quentin's monologue at the foot of one of Cherynobl's monolithic cooling towers is especially transfixing, and a performance that will be remembered for some time.  This movie will appeal to all types of people and all age groups - there's something here for everyone. Side-splitting comic relief is provided by Quentin's devil-may-care partner, Toronto Horowitz (also played by John Z. in true Sellers-esque fashion, with a little help from technical wizardry). Toronto's performance, while hilarious, does sometimes detract from the weighty subject matter of the film. This negative is the only point that kept "Art Film" from getting a full 5 out of 5 stars. Still, from the explosive beginning to the thrilling climax, "Art Film" is sure to transfix and satisfy - a definite must-see.   "ART FILM":   (four and one half out of five stars)
