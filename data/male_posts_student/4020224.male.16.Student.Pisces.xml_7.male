I said no, but then fat bastard Mr. lee say got test. K la “sorry for saying today no test K?” after physics practical some people were planning to play pool. Wanted to follow but..(adela) then ask a friend called weixian what time self study finish then he said “330 la” with low voice HAHAHA. There a friend called Fauzi, he pulled (1) s hair. I knew he was just playing but then, why he dare to pull someone’s hair.. It’s disrespectful. Like chui say “incorrigible”. I think I wont go steady with (2) so boring..la. Everyday thinking of (1), plain tired of that but just cant stop myself from thinking of perfect HER. Done nothing much to say already la.
