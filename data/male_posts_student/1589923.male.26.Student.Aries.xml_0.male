But still i have to go. it's a desire n ambition to be accomplished. sacrifice to be made. no matter how much it gona hurts tomorow, seeing the teary eyes. i have to be brave. to take it like a man. how long can i endure it? i duno. but i hope i have the strength to pull it thru for it will be a nite to be remembered forever.
