And we have used  the statement freely in essays, debates, speeches, history exams and a lot of other situations since the day we were born. Patriotism is a matter of accident. Wasn't it mere chance that you were born in India and not in New Zealand or Pakistan? And what if you were born in those countries? You would say that your country had had a glorious past. But that is when we let sentiments cloud our rational mind.  If you stop to ponder and really look at our history with a critical view what do you see? Two hundred years of subjugation and oppression by the Brits. And even longer period under the Mughals and other muslim invaders. And before that India wasn't India so to speak. Hundreds of principalities fighting among themselves like cats.  And what developments took place in these one and a half thousand years. Nothing very relevant on the scientific front. Unusable knowledge hidden in tomes which today makes us take pride in saying that we had done it first. But what use is something which does not benefit society at all. Big thing we discovered ZERO. What good did it do to us(Indians , I mean) ?? There is an even bigger list of our so called achievements which have benefited others but not us. Why??Even today we have to look west for new technology. Isn't that shameful? Even modern political systems have had there beginnings elsewhere and not in India. Democracy  had to be imported. And even today some people are yet to come to terms with it. How else do you explain the mammoth following of ranis and rajahs of bygone eras, which lifts them upto pedestals of power in our country even today? Industrial revolution didn't begin in India. This was because of the lack of crucial discoveries which in turn was due to lack of any serioius effort in this direction. What we have been fed since childhood has pulled a curtain over our eyes.This false shroud makes us complacent. We should really attempt to get at a true picture of our country and look at its problems with a clearer perspective. I don't mean to say that we nothing to be proud of. It's the incorrigible blindness of some of my countrymen that I dislike.
