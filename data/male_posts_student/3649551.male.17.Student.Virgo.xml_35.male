No but seriously, I'm shocked that people read this stuff. I don't know how much I really enrich people's lives with what I write here, but it's nice to have someone read it. Even if just a handful of people do, that makes this site more useful than a mere private journal. Honestly, what's the point of writing what will never be read? Writing isn't writing because it's written ... it's writing because it is read. Anyway, I'm looking into the rules and formats of writing a screenplay. I figure I should do my homework for the sake of Josh the Philosopher, who wants to co-write a screenplay. It's a whole different ball game from the stuff I write here, so I'm excited to broaden my horizons. Maybe once we start we'll post some of it here. While I'm on the subject of writing, I thought something today. I'm not really sure what to think of this thought, as I haven't quite had time to examine it and the validity of its claim. I was getting really annoyed at our two dogs: an old chocolate lab and a young dachsund. They were barking continuously at the dog next door, who barked back just as constantly.  Annoying as hell . I kept thinking, "what good do they think it'll do? Barking isn't going to accomplish anything." And then I compared literature to a dog's futile barking. What good does it do, beating the air and screaming our pain to the night? Will it make a difference or make things better? Will it fix the problems it's addressing? No, it will not ... ... in and of itself. But then I started thinking, what if somebody heard the noise and went to go check things out? And what if they slapped the bitches around a bit and solved the problem? (Sorry, I couldn't help myself. It was there and I had to take it.) My point is, barking doesn't do any good at all unless it motivates someone to go and figure out what's wrong. And that's what literature does. That's what makes a book great: it changes the way people think about things. If it doesn't motivate someone to change things, then it's just useless bitching. (Once again, I could not resist.) So if I ever write a book, I'm going to make absolutely sure that it says something worth saying. If I fail to change the reader in some way, then I'm a failure as a writer.
