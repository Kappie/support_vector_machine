Instead, we stayed in and watched Final Destination 2 on In Demand Pay Per View.  Made me feel kida sick, but it was a good movie :)  Ryans birthday today.  We're going to McDonalds again.  I can't wait to have one of the massive drinks again... mmmm.  Not long now until we go home.  I'm kinda excited and also sad cause we have to leave! :(  I'll just have to think of it as a 4/5 month holiday until we come back here lol, but somehow I don't think that would work...  Better get off to bed now, or else I'll get ryan jumping up and down on my bed to wake me up heh  Oh, and by the way... New Layout!  (If you hadn't already noticed LOL)  I've also scrapped the imood because it didn't fit with this layout :S
