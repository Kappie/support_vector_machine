I'm on steroids and anti-histemenes (sp?) at the same time. Result? I'm really tired, but really high. This leaves for slightly blurred speech, not feeling well, and not having a good attention span. Look, it's not a good combination, don't get on the wrong side of me at the moment, please... I can hardly cope as it is...  Basically... eeeeeeeeeeeep...
