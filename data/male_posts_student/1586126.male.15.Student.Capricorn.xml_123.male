(with my spiked hair) so people didnt really like me/my hair and decided to undo it. two spikes fell off. It was raining outside, and most of the ppl were outside. I went with them. unluckily, i was so bored, that i just had to talk to someone, and decided to risk my spikes. Oh well, i ended up undoing them after they were totally wet. (falling down wet).   People keep saying im not straight edge. Some ask me why the hell would i want to be one (alex and may more). Others think its retarded, and others...   just dont care about being straight edge.    like, out of the about 8 people that i know who are straight edge, well.. break their edge every week. (oO)  AND THEY STILL KEEP SAYING THEY ARE STRAIGHT EDGE (which kinda makes me feel that i should beat them up, but im making my best to keep pacifism at hand)  sigh. The fact that they consider themselves straight edge and do not think of it as life makes me feel insulted.   im still straight edge, i will never drink smoke or fuck, i am sorry for whatever errors i might have done, (i actually feel like i started a fad, which makes me look like an idiot) i can still think, and i will have my edge for life.   i hope gay j reads this because im kinda getting mad at him. he's just way too stupid and weird. specially when he's mad because its kinda funny, he talks to you in the same voice he talks to his pets.   ...      HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH  ok.  gay j, you should also learn to adapt (but not submit) to your surroundings, AND LEARN ABOUT PHYSICAL HARM  did you know that poking someone with a pointing stick at probably more than 10 km/hour inside the ear might cause severe damage? did you know that pushing someone on the stairs can also be a problem, that throwing 3 kg rocks at people's feet with a bit of strength might do something?  well you did that to jose alvaro. you also tried to attack/kill ignacio with a piece of broken glass but you fell and ended up cutting your hand (RETARD XD). well i actually wanna talk about that today, and too bad if you dont, cuz its my site and im feeling authoritative.   its not a rant, im just showing you how stupid you look. Remember the piece of wood (the one that i tore off the desk)that had some nails sticking out of it in the library? DO YOU REMEMBER POKING ME WITH IT? XD well whatever i dont care. anfter you poking me, (which hurt a lot, thank you for hammering a nail at my ribcage) i punched you? well i dont know what happened but whats kinda funny is that you got mad because you ppoked yourself because of me punching you.    XD  ok im gonna change subject again.   Remember the story that i made (the one where i cross out parts of a sentence, thats called fred james or something like that)? i showed it ot ms post. ACK bad idea. i talked about the main character smoking pot. Unluckily, she didnt notice that the main character (or the narrator) was a protagonist, talking in 1st person, and she thought that it was me talking about my day.   well first of all i dont normally shoot tvs or dogs, neither do i wake up at houses that aint mine and steal lamborghini diablos.    AND SECOND IM STRAIGHT EDGE  well after letting her know that i am not into drugs, she got pretty pissed at the fact that i hate bush.   i think she's right wing, or she's up for war, or she hates everyone bla bla bal   then i showed her my capitalism notes. she liked them, then we debated on why shouldnt capitalism exist (i dont want capitalism)  it has been like the best conversation (and probably the most intelligent) i have heard in MONTHS.  it was so cool i had fun. i wish i could make myself heard once in a while. I AM NOT A FREAK.  my mom is so weird. she always thinks that im failing every single subject at school. she thinks the worst of me. maybe she loves me, but the fact that she cant trust me when i tell her that im doing good offends me.   im not your puppet.   i will not tolerate thiskind of behavior. ive grown, im opinionated and im strong, so shut your mouth, I WILL NOT OBEY. this might not e in my rights, but i knw what is good for me and i can think, i know when there is something wrong.   disobey  against all authority  hey disobey and im not gonna listen to what you say hey disobey im not gonna listen i wont listen to you when you say im not aligned i wont listen to you fucking right wing slime you try to hold me down but i pull myself back up lets just skank together  and PICK IT UP  GO!   *jumps around*  bye peeps
