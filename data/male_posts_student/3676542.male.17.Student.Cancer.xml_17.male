I guessed we will be frozen to death by then if stay in the water for 1hour  We had a "FUN FILLED DAY" Swimming pool "isn't" that MUCH people So the pool "seemed" to belong to us SO SPACIOUS for the two of us to swim/dive. Diving was fun.. Knocked on to boon, didn't know he was swimming above me.. haha..  Got my self "tanned" but no sun burn..lucky me..lol Now going to rain..i was right a predicting weather for today.. I know it won't rain when we went for swim, and will rain when we are off..  Is my mouth to unlucky,or I know prediction.. for the pass 1 week,i predict correctly the weather..and sometime the time range for raining.. haha..Unlucky Mouth i have.
