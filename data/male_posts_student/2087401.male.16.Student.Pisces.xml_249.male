They're latino bands.  nurr.   anyways, this should probably have a point, huh?  OH!  BYE LARA!!!!!  Now...what else...today was my first day in stage tech since last monday!  Yay!  not really...but I took the test anyway and I'm positive I passed.  Prolly got an A, knowing me.  I'm such a nerd.  :D  lalalalalalalalalalala.  Oh!  I started making my ChRiStMaS presents today!  YAY!    I really need to stop writing this post, it's irritatingly random and pointless.  So...bye all!  Does my sexiness offend you?
