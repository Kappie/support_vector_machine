And i have yet complete 1 final task.... out of 6 fucking tasks... it took me almost a friggin month to reach where i am but it's not good enough. It is seriously pissing when things do not get done... So fucking frustrating. You spent shite load of time, reading, studying, doing the exercises, yet the output is not exactly as productive as you thought. This is shite. It is also a surprising fact that i am also catching the movies tonite... boy, talk about shooting myself on the foot.   I dun know... i was having this short chat with a fellow blogger yesterday and somehow what surprised me was when she mentioned a statment which i thought was uncalled for. she said, "well, problems come and go, unlike you *." I was surprised...i am like, "why do u have to compare yrself with me? does it make you feel better this way by putting someone down? i didn't really agree with what she said so i asked her what made her feel this way, she said, "Oh, from my senses and what * agrees too." Oh yeah. so together with another fellow blogger, both of u you feel the same way about me. Well, from what she implies, 'from her senses' i supposed she form her opinion and impression of me through all the conversations we had. and maybe she was a bad day yesterday therefore, the conversation was a tad bumpy... it didn't flow well at all. I mean she told me she hardly visit my site coz i am writing the same old stuff everytime she visits... whereas she has too much to write... well, so be it then... why the comparisions again? i feel that she's trying to be someone who's icy and almighty.. the kind of image she wanna potray is similar to the gal, Julia Stilts in "10 things i hate about you". She doesn't give a damn about anything whatsoever and being hard to get and stuff, it's like trying to be a feminist with an attitude... I mean why all the dramatic persona? even her blog, she is putting words like ," in my icy tone".... and the most prominent indication has to be her title of the blog... but of course, i ain't gonna mention it here. Well, therefore, i made it a point to be a pain as well in my replies with her. I was adopting the same tone of response as her..very curt and blunt. trying to be 'almighty' myself. I really didn't like our conversation at all... In a way it is sad becoz i always thought she can be a really nice friend but i guess...people comes and go and especially with the internet.. to lose a friend is as easy as erasing the words from yr notebook... once it's gone, it's gone... you write it over with something else.   Well, enough of the bitching here... after much cooler thoughts and calmer sense of mind, i figure that she might be having a bad day that's all and it's alrite if she think of me this way. To each is own. Hopefully, the next time round, she'll be having a better day.
