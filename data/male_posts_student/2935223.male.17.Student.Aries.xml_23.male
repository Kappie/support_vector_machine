The DDR/LAN party was actually a lot kooler than I thought it might be.....even though I had to leave at midnight....poo.  Darn my father and his not-trustingness....the only reason I had to leave was because I doesn't like the thought of me sleeping where girls are also, even though of the three children he has, I'm probably the one he DOESN'T have to worry about.....1.) Considering my brother had a kid at 19 and my sister went out with Donald Spencer....I mean....COME ON!!! 2.) There were no girls there who would've come within 5 feet of me anyway....and basically there was one girl who was even noticing that I was alive, and that was tre, because she was using me as a pillow....other than that....I was totally girl-free....pshhh...and my dad doesn't trust me....I probably wouldn't have slept anyway...just played DDR and stuff.  I think that Tina is trying to make me kill myself.....I dunno if she does it on purpose..or if it's just a terrible coincidence for me...but...it seems every time that we're both at sum type of social events...she always wears her hottest clothes....almost to taunt me.....most liekly on a total fluke though......because...if she actually did that....that would mean she actually paid attention to me....but....I know that she doesn't..so.....I'M INSANE!!!!! My life is very blah right now......so....I'm gonna go back...and sit and stare at my computer monitor....and go......"blah"...because I seem to be good at that....Peace!  Spense
