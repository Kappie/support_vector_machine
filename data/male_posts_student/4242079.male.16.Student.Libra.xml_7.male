I can't seem to figure out what is wrong. If it is broken on her computer, it must be broken on other computers. Being the web-design perfectionist I am, I must completely redo my page. Another 15 hours of work in front of my computer awaits! A new concept, a new look. Perhaps I'll design it with my domain in mind, because that is my next "me" purchase. A domain name.   urlLink  postCount('nov42002');
