It's also the venue I've had the honor of playing at three times. Once with The Random (on drums), and twice with the Doug Little Twin Cities Jazz Workshop combo (on piano). Its fun playing a professional venue, especially when the inside of the Yamaha baby grand is littered with signatures and notes from pros all the way from Benny Green to Oscar Peterson. Playing that piano, well, its...awesome.  Songs we (the 8-piece combo) played: 1. All Blues, by Miles Davis 2. Little Sunflower, by Freddie Hubbard 3. Killer Joe, by Bennie Golson 4. um...some Cuban/Latin cha-cha-cha thing lol  Yep, I'm a jazz musician. I like the music, so what? And for all the people out there who think it's not music, it is. And it DOES take talent...lots of talent to become good at it. The art of improv doesn't come over night. And also I would think it takes more talent to become a jazz musician than to become some random rapper.  Also, despite some peoples' viewpoints, I am not poor. Well...relatively lol. I earned 50 bucks tonight mowing 2 lawns-the first money I've earned in many weeks. But, I've been known to spend money when I get it, that is, second on the list to putting all the money in the bank. Those 50 dollars went towards a brand new $76 blue Scorpion fiberglass-coated pool cue. hm...maybe I still don't deserve that kind of cue based on my playing...  And now the sleeping-in for the rest of August starts. What a relief ^_^
