Which is already some milestone, judging by the way these power hungry idiots who he has for allies. below i post an earlier message i had written at a discussion forum. Just like i had wished, Sonia decided to step aside for Manmohan and wants to control from behind the scenes.. This though, is clearly a selfish decision to boost her moral authority, ppl and the silly media have mistakenly termed this renunciation. Far from it in my opinion. Her silly act back when she lied to the President about 272 MPs backing her and her demenour until the fateful day when she stepped out show she was as power hungry as anyone but only she regained her senses. now to the post.  Jaya has suffered a colossal defeat, yes but she has been known to recover tremendously. So we cant count her out yet.  But really, apart from the media hype with some amount of truth in it on her high-handedness in adminstration, I dont see her any different from mu.ka who is just as corrupt, if not more and morally bankrupt. To call him oppurtunistic will be an understatement, as can be known from his famous (though these have started to become a bit retarded of late with his recent 'pakistan zindabad' dumb story) quips, that they were testing waters for 4 years under BJP led NDA rule with ministers in the cabinet. Am sorry, for a seasoned politician like him, I expect at least a better excuse. Suddenly BJP became madhavadha arasu after the DMK had stuck as parasites to power for most of the rule and quit before elections based on policies. For Gujarat carnage which was indeed a black mark, however pointing the entire blame upon Sangh Pariwar is a bit biased in my humble opinion. The other community in question had its share of blame too. Be that as it may, Mu.Ka, had he quit at the time, we cud have believed he was making a statement, but he conveniently chose to stick with BJP.  Interestingly, RSS has issued a statement saying BJP has forgotten Hindutva and hence failed. The Oppn saying BJP is essentially too much hindutva and hence failed to woo secular indian masses. Which is true, I wonder. In TN, of course the evidently secular Muslim League is a partner in the 'secular' democratic progressive alliance of dmk. wah...  Coming to TN, as much as i loathe jaya and mu.ka, I personally give slighter preference to Jaya, just for her dealing with Govt. Employees. As much as she can be arrogant, sure the raw force she showed in clamping down the strike, put those buffoons in their places. Over-rated, Under-working, corrupt fools that mostly seem to make up our govt. machinery. Anyone who has gone recently to get even a LLR or to sort out a problem with ur local EB/Water dept. will vouch for this am sure. These long time trade union cancer has plagued India ever since her independence and in my opinion, more than who rules, its these corrupt janta thats responsible for the state we r in.. pitiable state, fyi. What happened? They went silent and fell on their knees within a couple of days.   The Labour belligerence is more due to antiquated labor laws which need much reform, though this is not going to happen at least until those dreaded communists and their comrades are removed from power. At present, as Frank Wisner put it, Indian labour laws simplified: You can hire, but u cant fire. So much for progress.  Let me be clear, am not saying govt workers cannot demand rights. Sure. They can. But let them work first. Let them earn their privileges.  So, thats that. I doubt terms like productivity and efficiency are even known to these ppl. But hey, u cant privatize loss making PSUs, becoz its not populist. Surely, way to go India!  As for anti-conversion law, some ppl here are raking it up more than wat its worth. Rights guaranteed by our constitution are not denied, as mistakenly or intentionally miscontrued by some here. Only Conversions based on monetary benefits are prohibited. Am not sure whats wrong with that.  Cancellation of subsidies etc are long-term decisions, that are not populist but indeed help us in reducing our deficit. Sure, these hard decisions may mean she has at least a long term policy (Which i doubt though). Yes, we have poor in the millions and they needed to be tended to. Developed countries have social compensation programmes, but we r not rich enuf to devote our money in the military and needless populist policies. We r not a developed country, at least yet at any rate. Deepening our deficits and loans is not the right way to becoming one either. Alternate policies are needed. What they r, if u ask, is beyond me, and is for the over paid department guys to sort out.   Coming to Ration Card with 'H' symbol, I think again it was a hard long term decision. The same ppl who wud have jumped up to type flame for my previous paragraph, wud but have to agree with me here. If u earn more than a certain amount of money, I think its 5000Rs., which is way way more than the poorest of the poor earn, for whom India is not shining apparently, Surely u must be able to afford to feed ur family. If u cannot, too bad, u must consider switching to a better job, or cut down ur expenses. Coz, we r a poor nation and only can afford so much to protect our poor, who definitely need the rice and rations. Not middle class and lower middle class income groups, who r affluent under indian conditions, and who can afford convent education for their children, mobile phones and bikes. Sorry, Give me one reason why u must get rations in subsidized prices. One Reason, please.  Kaveri issue and water problem indeed are partly due to failure of monsoons and lack of foresight. Indeed, Its a failure. Somehow, Jaya is held responsible for the entire debacle. Mu. Ka and his pet SUN conveniently forget it was he, Mu. Ka who withdrew the case from SC to get into the good books of Indra. And Jaya being no better, with her arrogance has brought nothing forward.  As for Jaya. She deserves to go. So does mu. ka. His rule has not been the golden period of TN as his pet SUN TV likes to emphasize with the sycophant Malan in place. His track record in violence and corruption is first-rate and is of the highest quality with only Jaya trailing behind him. For Stalin, well, so far he has proven to be a great successor to his father at least in areas of crime.  Next comes, our docutter Ramados, CEO of the Official Forest-Clearing Party of TN. PMK indeed is one party thats pragmatic enuf to have a minister in every govt that forms in the center. They have taught tamilians how to cut trees, burn buses and horse-trade. Other than that, nothing substantial except Caste based bull emanating from thailapuram, and sadly ppl seem to buy it still. AK Moorthy was the only notable exception in this gypsy clan.  Vaiko is energetic indeed. But, with a big BUT, he supports terrorists. They fight for our so-called brothers of Tamil Eelam or not is not the issue. They kill innocent ppl, they r terrorists. Period. No matter what they do and what their cause is. Arafat has a cause. Bin Laden has a cause and so evidently does Prabhakaran. And if someone says he offers support to such ppl and openly admits to having visited the terrorists indeed, I leave the option of judgement to Tamilians. They, until now seem to think its ok to have friendship with LTTE and like minded guerillas. Hopefully they will learn their lesson soon. (digression: Mu. Ka casually spoke in his press. conf of repealing POTA. Am not sure he is aware of what the world is going through in the hands of terrorists due to such lethargic policies. And with our easy to ignite communal flame, which is already seeing 'fellow brothers' coming to fight for "The Cause" from as far as Chechnya, Afghanistan, Central Asian Republics and even the UK, will anyone sane enuf speak of repealing the POTA?)  Who else is there in Tamil Nadu? GK Vasan, tis going to be a hard time fighting internal politics of COngress in TN, so i highly doubt he is ever going to be in contention for managing TN as Chief Minister.  The Rise of Thirumavalavan and Krishnaswamy signal the alarming levels to which our democracy has stooped. Lower than Mettur Dam, that is. More buffoons, for ur private entertainment.  Rajinikant voice kodukkave romba yosikkirar. Atchikku vandha, endha prechnainalum yesnum sollale, nonnum sollale sollitu imayamalai poiduvar. adhukkule 5 varusham mudichidum.   Only BJP is left, and they r not even in the race as far as TN is concerned.  The Big Picture of course is in the center, as much as the coterie of Sonya would like to claim this election as a mandate to congress, it s absolutely not; if we step back a little to observe. Congress wudnt have improved much on their earlier tally if not for massive failure of the BJP in AP and TN, and these states they lost again due to state-level anti-incumbency than anything to do with indians pouring in the millions into the election booths to make sure Sonia became PM, like they wish to project. Sonia, if only she had a more analytical mind, wud clearly have not opted to be PM. For whatever she does, good or bad, her motives are going to come to question. She wud have been better off being the sidelines controlling than blatantly ascending the PM-ship, much to the humiliation of many Indians, if not felt now, will be realized in the years to come.   Whos going to be in 2006? Unless, the EC announces its purported 'None of the Above' option in the EVM, we have to live with one of these people. R.I.P, Tamil Nadu.   ---- Note: 3 very significant things have happened in the days after this piece was written.. 1) Jaya withdrawing all her reformist policies in one blanket statement. This in my opinion is very bad in the long term. All these now gone policies were good things to do, in the future interests of the state. Now Jaya withdrawing has done significant damage, at least wrt me, who considered her to be more staunch in policy and expected her to remain steadfast to these reforms. Nothing comes for free, and Manmohan has essentially said the same in his earlier FM stint.   2) More proof emerged for Mu. Ka's policy and political maturity rather immaturity. He was yapping all along about his party not being in there for power, which was a good ploy to get good ministries. Then cheap kuzhayadi sandai style statement when he wasnt offered the berths he reqd. I am curious to know, if DMKs ministers can only function in certain ministries? The obvious blaring reason staring in our face is his apparent intent to plunder public money. Nothing else. Whats a good ministry and a not so good ministry. Also he may wish to continue TR Baalu style politics to constantly nag Jayas govt. The pinnacle of mu.kas cheap politics is Dayaniti Maran's cabinet post. Its simply astonishing that he is still not satisfied even after Sonia offered a Cabinet berth to Dayanithi, on the sole qualification that he is mu.kas relative, despite being absolutely a novice to politics. His career so far being involved in maintaining SCV in Chennai. And he gets cabinet. When even veterans in congress are MoS. What about Scindia, Jiten Prasad and most prominently Rahul Gandhi. Even he has stayed out of power. But mu.kas main ambition seems to be power and the money that comes with it.  3) If u thought mu. ka was bad, think of our docutter. His son is not even an MP! For Gods sakes, this is just outrageous stuff. All his previous promises of his kin will not hold any govt office went down the drain. Anbumani, a doctor by education, though has not even faced an election. Well, u may say, so is Manmohan Singh, but one look at his CV will silence his critics on this issue at least. But Anbumani.. please..
