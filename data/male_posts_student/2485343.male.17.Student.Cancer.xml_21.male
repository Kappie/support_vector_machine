I've wondered if this happens in life with the people we meet and the relationships we are in. Say you and this guy/girl are dating you move slowly toward each other until you meet in the middle. Once you meet, do you bounce off eachother and move away? Are we all destined to be alone with the theory of Newton's Third Law? If it does, then I would like to go really slow with the people I know and like, I don't want to bounce off each other in a elastic collision. Just a thought...
