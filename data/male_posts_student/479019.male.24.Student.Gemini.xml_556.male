I did renditions of Modern English's "Melt with you" and the Offsprings "Pretty Fly for a (Asian) guy." Last time I smashed the mic against my head during the Eurythmics' "Sweet Dreams" and opened up my forehead.  I have about 5.5 pages left to write and I'm mostly done with the editting.  Tomorrow I need to return some books and get writing done.  Also going to Dave and Busters tomorrow night.  Tonight was fucking fun.   ***
