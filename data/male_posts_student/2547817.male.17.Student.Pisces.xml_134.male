Shaka Laka's been playing in my head non-stop for the past two days. I even broke out dancing in front of the mrror in the hospital's elevator. Unfortunately, the door opened on the second level whilst I was on my way up to the third and this malay cleaner lady just stared at me, who embarrassed, was caught in an indian pose with my leg on my knee and my hands in an arc above my head. Mind you, the arc was tilted to form a "C".No joke. She probablly thought I was on my way to psychiatrics.  Got wet and very cold at the KAP bus stop. Terrible weather. Got into studio shivering. Did routine warm ups. I didn't like many things about it. I have problems being humble. Maybe it's that. Maybe I'm not used to being the follower. God grant me humility and meekness.  We got on the bus to Ngee Ann andbefore I got off, I had a flash thought that I might fall off the slippery steps.True enough, I slipped on the last step; and what's worse, I was holding theboom box!Here's the kicker, something in me woke up and I landed on the road with one leg on theground and the other in mid air balancing me. FREAKING COOL SHIT LAH! I stood like that for about 4 seconds, almost everyonearound me looking, and exclaimed triumphantly like I'd proven something to myself, "I'm a dancer! What? You wantedme to fall?" Hahaha!They giggled.  Did a run on the large stage. It was huge and man... I had to move in 8 beats from stage left to right. Retarded! About 20 metres in 4 seconds! Anyway, we didnt really know what to do for the finale, so this British looking chap scolded us and was pretty sarcastic about it. This didn't sit well at all with the Madams and Rae.. They kicked up quite a storm. If you ask me, everything was blown out of proportionby our side. I mean, the guy just made a comment about us not turning up for rehersals with the other groups and told us that we had no idea what we were doing when we were on the stage for the finale. He was right. We didn't, and therefore, his statement was justified. I didn't feel that we were terribly wronged. Maybe it's because I'm pretty forgiving. Maybe it's coz I'm not as proud as the Madams or Rae. Now, don't get me wrong here, I'm not speaking ill of them at all. All I'm saying is that pride is adrama mask. It's pride that blew the matter up ;-( ,BUT it's also pride that brought the matter up ;-). I admire their pride, whether it be for the school or for the company. I like Mrs Creffield. She's a well of wisdom I can learn alot from. Hope to get closer with her.  I liked getting dressed. Shiny purple long pants, sequin-laden vest over a fitting black T-shirt, black socks, black dance shoes, wax, moose, hair spray, fix wild hair, foundation, powder, eye shadow, lip balm, lip gloss, blusher, necklace and bangle and STRETCH!. I simply loved it. Too bad I have to rely on makeup to look good. I think I am vain.  Pre-performance, we were behind curtains in pitch darkness. The UV light made our teeth glow and it was pretty funny. Despite this, with only one green light stick, we slipped into a mode of total concentration. Running the steps simultaneously with the trackmentally.This sounds funny, but it was almost ritualistic and spiritual.  Today, I actually performed with the legendary AC dancers. No; today I wasan AC dancer, and WE were good.
