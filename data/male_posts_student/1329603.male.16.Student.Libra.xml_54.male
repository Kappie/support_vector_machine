Still, they're quite good, and I was quite proud of my ingenuity in some of them (in an attempt that didn't pay off, I stood inside a bush). I'm going to try to get the last 3 on this film of the choir.  Sam's alive and is ignoring me again ^_^. Better than nothing, hey?  Anyway, I'm more tired than usual -_-.  Love, Jon Roskilly
