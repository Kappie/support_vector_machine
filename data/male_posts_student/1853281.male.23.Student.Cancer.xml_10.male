Just a pretty chill bar with very strong very cheap drinks. We chatted for like an hour and a half with this cat, S. He seemed nice, bought us a round, so of course i would think him nice. Very suave. Of course i had no balls and did not give him my number, when i finally decided i was brave enough he had slipped out the back. Oh well, don't think he was at all interested, but nice conversation. I should be cleaning my house right now but am nursing a very bad hangover and am trying to both rehydrate and drink enough coffee to wake up. I have to be well by 3:00 when i go shopping with my mother. Nothing else going on.
