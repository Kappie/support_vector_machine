I don't know how they're gonnapull off "Maps" live, because it has three guitar parts, each one integral tothe song,and the band only has one guitarist. But if I can remember to watch on Wednesday, my curiosity will be satisfied. On a similar note, Sonic Youthwason there today,andtheir new song soundedgreat, which surprised me, as Sonic Youth is one of those bands whose critical acclaim has always bewildered me. Maybe I'll pick up their new album.
