Basically, in my opinion, religion is basically the quest for knowledge about what follows after death, and how to make life after death pleasant. There is more to it, but basically, that's all it boils down to. My problem with Christianity, Judiasm, and Islam is it's hard to believe that we only have one life to prove ourselves, and when we die, we are immediately sentenced to a wonderful bed of clouds where everything is perfect or a firey dungeon of pain for eternity. I just can't help but think there's much more to it than that. I do not consider myself an aethist, however, as I can't look at this vast universe and feel that there is nothing behind it. There must be a force or being behind this, life must have a meaning. I, and no person on this planet, for that matter, can know what ensues death. Perhaps we are reincarnated, perhaps we become another human being, perhaps something else happens. But I can not bring myself to believe that whether or not I swear too much, if I have sex before marriage or not, and whether I commit some other "sin" as defined by the church will decide my life for eternity. What do I think is "wrong"? I try to live my life on the basic principle that it is wrong harm someone or their property without good cause, and it is wrong to steal. I try to be kind to others, I try to be as peaceful and friendly as I can. I believe that if there is a God watching over us all, that is all he could want, is a loving soceity. I have trouble with the organized religions, as they promote the idea of God as being "love", but also preach about the "firey wrath and vengence" that he will strike down on us if we lead "sinful" lives. If there is a God as we know him, I truly believe that he does represent, or is love. If he is a vengeful tyrant, then well, it's a pretty dreary existence we have here. It's hard to think of what awaits us after our passing, but I believe, with all my heart, that it is not dull and dismal as some people would like me to believe. If there is a God, why would he focus on suppressing our natural instincts as human beings, especially if he created us this way, instead of simply promoting the idea of love, and unity between us all?   -Henry    "Sin lies only in hurting others unnecessarily. All other "sins" are invented nonsense." -Robert A. Heinlein
