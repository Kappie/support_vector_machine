This is because it took an hour to clear customs and another hour to drive through the solid flows of low-cc bikes and scooters that passes for traffic around her.  Observations: Vietnamese sighted – at least 10,000; non-Asian people sighted (outside the vehicle i was travelling in)– 0; old-school conical oriental hats –3, all worn by old women involved in low-status work e.g. picking through garbage; cute girls – hundreds.  Motorbikes and mopeds sighted – thousands; bicycles sighted – 3; cars sighted – about 10; cyclos sighted – 3, but none of them appeared to be operational; other vehicles sighted –about five.  Also, all the buildings are the same width, which is about three metres. They’re all terraced, but some are up to six stories tall and a block thick, standing in amongst two storey buildings, they look hilarious. From air it looked like the entire city was a mixture of shipping containers and parked cars.  They still have the same French guy doing the weather on CNN that the did last time I watched the channel four years ago.
