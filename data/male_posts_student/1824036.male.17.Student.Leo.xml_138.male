Jake has his part down simple. Tom just looked at the music for the first time Sunday, but he is a fantastic bassist (bass guitar player-ist). He has his part almost to perfection. I know my part great with all the little lead parts trown in there and everything. I got the solo down pat.  All I need now, is to find something to wear. I think that I will ask Gorman (my sisters boy toy) to wear. He is a fashon guru...but not one of them feminine ones. Anywho... I need something to wear...then I need to sound check the auditorium. Need to get Dan to learn his part, and TUNE SHORTY'S DRUMS!!! That bothers me...his drums are awesome...just out of tune.  We need Dan there today though. We are practicing again, and he was sick from school...He is our lead vocals...he also plays a pretty impoortant part after the solo...  We will see what happens...  P.S. Adam Moritz said he might come out tonight and play a little with us. He is just starting to play guitar! That will be cool!
