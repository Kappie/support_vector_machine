I'm tired but I feel very buzzy and I just don't feel like settling down, but I will hopefully soon *yawns*  It has been a long hard day for all of us, and it really doesn't feel right being here, knowing that we should all be in America having a great time still.  Pinch me, I still think I'm dreaming :(  Oh well, I'm sure I'll just wake up in the morning and feel the wrath of the real world.  School starts soon, I'm excited about that even though it's going to strange with all the new changes.  Dad came earlier to see us.  We're going tomorrow to stay for the weekend and to celebrate Ryan's birthday again for the people in England.  I'm currently guzzling down some Mountain Dew I bought home, the caffeine settles me down o.O!  I have some pictures from the flight and the journey home to upload, but I'll do it tomorrow when I feel awake.  I'm off for a bit and then I'll go to bed, night :)
