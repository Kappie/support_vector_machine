John F. Kerry will formally accept the party nomination. Many Republicans admit that they lack the votes to pass such an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and as such the Democrats charge that the GOP is pushing this as a divisive issue and to rally the conservative base of the GOP. Colorado Republican Sen. Wayne Allard said during a Capital Hill news conference "We don't consider this a divisive issue. Support for this amendment comes from a cross-section of America". Other GOP Senators, such as Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, assert that they "didn't pick this battle... this was thrust upon us [by activist judges and Massachusetts and California]".  Democratic Presidential nominee John Forbes Kerry, Senator from Massachusetts, opposes amending the Constitution to ban gay marriage, and like other Democrats supports the states-rights issue of the ordeal being left up to individual states. Sen. Allard refused to give details on vote counts, but did state that he believes there is "a lot of support" for the issue. Even if the U.S. Senate confirmed such an amendment, it would take a two-thirds vote of both the Senate and House of Representatives followed by three-fourths of the 50 states ratifying the amendment before it would formally become part of the Constitution.  This legislation is among other conservative amendments in Congress that have little hope of passing, such as another proposed forced vote on an anti-flag burning amendment. Polls show that American's don't favor gay marriage, but that they thing the war in Iraq, healthcare, and the economy are more important in this November's elections.   Frankly this is just pre-election crap the GOP is tossing about because they fear losing the election to Kerry, and they have nothing else to offer but rally their freakishly conservative right-wing followers in their favorite past-time: bigotry, discrimination, and homophobia. Frankly these "activist judges" are all serving the good of the people by interpreting the Constitution in the most equal sense. Their job is not to keep America narrow-minded, but to broaden her to be inclusive of everyone. I found it comical that Bush could visit the site of  Brown v. Board of Topeka, Kansas  on the 50th Anniversary of such a landmark even in American equality and call it a "good thing". Were the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices on that case not "activist judges" as well? Didn't they greatly change the institution of American education and help strengthen the Civil Rights movement about a decade later? What's the difference here? Judges are trying to give gay Americans the same rights the rest of the country has. It is interesting to note that Christians, Jews, Muslims, Bhuddists, B'hai, Atheists, Agnostics, etc. can all get married here in the United States, whether the two people involved are of different race or religion, or even have no religion at all, as long as they are still a Man and a Woman. What, exactly, is being protected by discriminating against gay Americans? This can't be a religious issue, because as I said different religions can marry, and atheists can marry. Plus religious doctrine should not and cannot interfere with civil laws. This also can't be a biological issue, since people incapable of having children can wed, and some married people choose not to have children. So really the defense is quite weak, but Americans keep getting pummled with lies from the Republicans and religious whacko's. There is some legislation in Congress now who's purpose is to undo the "damage" of the courts. The religious cable networks have huge misleading infomercials on it, and even contradict the Constitution. The first Amendment says that Congress shall not make any laws with respect to religion, but this legislation specifically mentions the word "God", exactly as I have it (without the quotes) and in the Christian context.  As a postscript, one of the "commentators" for that infomercial was Pat Buchanan. No surprise there, as the best way to make people believe in your crap is to get an Ã¼ber-conservative ass who's all talk and no facts on screen to talk about the evils of homosexuality. Would you really take this man seriously, a man who believes Sen. Joseph McCarthy was "a patriot", Adolf Hitler was "a man of great courage" and that AIDS is "retribution" for the homosexual "war against nature"? So if myself and the rest of the gays are waging a war against nature, why, exactly are we still here? And why have we been here since civilization began? I think it's about time America wages war on intolerance, homophobia and inequality and gets the GOP out of the government.
