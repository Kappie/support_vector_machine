I got Nia this funny Bill Cosby CD as a birthday present, as a joke of course.  I'm such a joker.  This weekend kinda sucked though.  Friday, I went to some Hotel in Newark to go to some weird sort of 115th anniversy for my Grandmother's church.  It was so boring, damn black people give away to many things (This has a double meaning).  So that really sucked, but I've played WarcraftIII all weekend so it didn't matter.  Saturday was that damn play rehearsal, arrggg!!!  I hate Easter plays.  It's crap like this that makes me want to detach myself from all the other youths in my church. I have seriously taken big rolls in the plays for the past 4 or maybe 5 years.  Sick of it, only suprise is I'm not the oldest since Paul is in it also.  Thank God! But has like 4 lines.  I have 4 pages.  Mungu Mzuri! Sinaiomba hii!!! Haha.  Bi-lingualness.
