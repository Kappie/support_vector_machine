The new release is for paying customers only, and when it does become available to the public its just a dulled down version with missing packages. Linux is registered under the GPL, Gnu Public license, which protects the freedom of technology and programs, letting people obtain the source code and modify it to whatever liking they have, but never to sell it. Mandrake is just being as evil as Red Hat started out being. I'm very proud of our school; they already blocked the new google mail service that is still in the beta version, adhering to their strict rules of absolutely no outside contact with the free world. Trying to keep information from people and prohibiting any type of contact with fellow students. I wouldn't be surprised to see the expression of the human mind prohibited. Mrs. Rowsom, our tech director still hates me; I have no clue as to why still. I have the urge to bring in a laptop next year to use my own stuff in school, but Mrs. Rowsom still won't let me use the network with it. Our school is too full of idiots that they can't trust anyone with anything, which is why they have every computer locked up with Fortress and guarded with Bess. Anyway, I'm just rambling on about nothing, and this homework won't do its self, LaterALL
