Well I found this website when messing around on yahoo search with a friend, Hi Casey, well she found it really.  on of her shurch interns has a blog on here.  Well this site if you haven't guessed is going to be my Homepage, thus it will be filled with various things about my life.  Pretty boring.  Maybe it will one day be about more stuff.  Well I guess I will give a brief bio to start with.                I am a sophmore in High school.  I enjoy speech and literature.  I have 2 brothers and a mom.  We all live in the U.S.A.  i am on my High school forensics team.  I participate in the hardest type of debate, Cross-Examination or CX for short.  My Cx partner, Josh, is a total Rep.  so we disagree on a lot of issues in debate.   I completly despise all of Bush's tactics with war and some of his others.  Josh on the other hand is the biggest Bush supporter in the world.  I plan to go to college to get a degree in theology and philosophy to be a youth minister when I am older.  I love texas and hope to move their when I move out of home.  I am a big tech fan but an even bigger Huskers fan (college sports).   Well I can't think of anything else to say right now.  Maybe I will write soon.                                               Later,
