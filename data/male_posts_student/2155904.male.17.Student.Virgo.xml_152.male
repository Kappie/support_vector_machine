So that's pretty sick.  Cuz now he can get his for pretty cheap.  So if you want a discount on your tux come to Tyke and he will hook you up.  Don't go to anybody else once reading this.  Tyke now has to be your pick.  So Tyke is really getting no work done right now.  Which is a usual occurrence for him.  He should really be working on his physics paper, or at least just finishing up the blog, but instead he is just chatting away online.  Yeah, time to finish this up.  Tyke has sorta worked on his physics paper all day, but not really.  He spent a lot of time downloading 80s songs as he is making another mix of a decade.  He's probably gonna redo the 90s cd just cuz it was a haphazard attempt last time.  Refuge was good tonight.  The student story was poignant and the rest of it was a lot of fun.  Tyke was in a really good mood.  Probably because the car ride over got him pumped cuz Dotti and Purdy and Tina were all peppy and fun.  On the car ride back Tyke stuck his whole head out the window and at first it was scary cuz it was like a roller coaster.  He just looked straight outside and it was scary.  Scary.  Then he got used to it and it wasn't scary.  Yeah, this blog is pointless.  But today was pretty good.  And tomorrow will hopefully be a fantastic weather day.  That always softens the blow of Monday blues.  Gotta love it.  Tyke that is.
