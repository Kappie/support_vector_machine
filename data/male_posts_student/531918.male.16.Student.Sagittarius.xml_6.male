There had to be partners.  Originally Kieran was going to be my partner because we had discussed our strategy earlier.  We were going to be Team Ramrod (his decision... it's from  Super Troopers , but it sounds dirty).  Then, Grund decides that teams should be boy-girl.  So, I'm stuck with Katie.  Just great.  Kieran and I still played in the same four-person group.  Both of us patent the pool-cue style, but I usually don't lie entirely on the ground... I don't trust what's fallen on those greens.  I ended up with a 51 (when 36 is par) total.  Kieran got 40.  Then, all of us went to Friendly's for some ice cream.  Everybody else got these tiny little Happy Ending sundaes, but I went with the five-scoop serving.  It took me less than five minutes to get that thing down.  I am a beast at eating ice cream.  So, while I suck at putt-putt, I got ice cream out of the deal.  Plus, I didn't pay for it.  Life is good.
