Not seeing her online is helping, least i dont think of her so often as i used to .. but then again i still miss her. spoke to her the other day, it felt like something was missing. I guess its time for me to move on ( or move away?)  Dont expect anything to happen to me now i\ll be heading back home soon . Telling everyone that im happy to go back, but the truth is that, i dont want to go back  there is still  so much to do and so mauch to see. it cant end this way  can it ... time will tell . None of the job companies have replied .  WOOSh's havin the time of her life. I still havent heard from Dave.
