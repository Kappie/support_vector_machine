The June holidays have just slipped away like how good things usually go, but HAVE June holidays been good, now? I've been besieged by some crazy fools who prefer to believe in fantasy and trust their hearts instead of their heads.   Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I shouldn't be able to pass my Economics JCT. Dearest Maggie had told the cohort that those that attempted the question on prices - the topic which she only gave out the lecture notes AFTER the test, what a pleasant woman - would have failed, and flunked with magnitude at that.  Rrrrrrright. Yes, headaches.
