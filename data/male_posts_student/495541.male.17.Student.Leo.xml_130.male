I wanted that to work so bad so I could just continue to do almost nothing in that class and get an A.  Here's some advice for you people wanting to get good grades.  Take web design 1, and take web design 2.  If you're decent with computers, it's an easy A!  Woo ya.  Alright.  The rest of the day was just blah blah blah, like normal.  Except maybe for 4th hour where I find out I have to support Fascism.. uhh no joke.  Yeah well maybe that's a little out of context but it's the truth.  We have to come up with propaganda and ways to get people in the class to agree with the ideas of Fascism.  Wow that's great.  How easy is it going to be for the people who have Democracy?  Yeah.  That and we get 5 points automatically off if our team isn't voted the best out of the class.  WTF!?  That's wrong.  I also got picked to write the speech for my group.  I was thinking I could come up with some mock ruler who supports Fascism.  I thought of a name like Rudolph Fitler or something stupid to mock Hitler.  I figure that would get a laugh -- but yeah how can Hitler possibly be funny?  No he can't.  He was just a man with some really whacked out ideas that just somehow led to over 9 million or something people being killed.  Woo -- and I get to advocate his form of government.  Thanks O'dell.  Anyways, my day wasn't really as bad as I make it sound.  I don't suppose that assignment will be that bad after all.  The weekend is almost here and that's the greatest time of the week.  It's a temorary escape from all that causes stress, confusion, discomfort, and pain.  School, I'm convinced, is evil.  Evil not in it's entireity, but the basic principals it supports.  School is a neccessity though.  It seems more often than not that school is just another way for the selected few to get ahead of the others.  The way school is set up, it seems great.  Like communism looks great on paper.  It's just that not everyone is the same and not all people get the same when all is said and done.  It's amazing just how our government is still in one piece.  And wow, I need to give up on this ranting.  So many times I try to justify my opinions when no one will care.  You're not going to see support for the banning of school any time soon, so what the hell am I talking about.  Tomorrow we've got a game against Dub. Senior.  Should be a good one, come out and watch.  I think I'm just a bit tired now.  Good night.
