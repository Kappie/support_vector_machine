I think someone needs to write a book "How to order food at McDonalds for Dummies".  You wouldn't believe some of the things people say that come through there. Just ask BethAnne about some of her expierences there. But anyways, off the negative work situation. I am getting so excited about going to band camp. I called my friend from Hale thats going, she is really excited too. I also can't wait for payday on friday. I need some money, I am about broke. My dad gave me $5 which I found exciting cause I had like $6 left. As you can see my day was just too exciting. But wait, it gets better. I got home and practiced my trumpet for a long time, something I haven't done in a while. It was intense. I am such a band geek! Oh well, I don't care, I enjoy it! I don't see how anyone couldn't enjoy band. Music is an awesome thing. That was pretty much my day. Ohh wait,lol my dad made awesome steaks tonight on the grill. They were really good! The one benefit of having cows, the great meat. Well I think I am going to go to bed soon.
