Friday was fine, or at least it went fine for me...Math class was nice since I knew what Aberin was ranting about...Differentiation Techniques and stuff...English and Literature classes were so-so...  Dr. Pesigan gave as some work for our "research kit" in English...he who gets an F in the research paper automatically gets an F in his final grade...so be cautious...  Mark's discussion, to his disgust, was interrupted by the bell so we didn't have homework except to read the new readings on Point of View and A Rose for Emily...pero according to my calculations, we'll be doing that on lets say wednesday pa...owing to our need to extend our discussion of The Hitchhiking Game...  Ow...and I forgot Intact...it was totally boring with our two "facilitators"...well, its not that boring but it was not so-so...we had to do GDs and stuff according to their will...and do lectures and stuff, hell, they might even want papers...oh, and I'm also the Physics Group Beadle while Pendix is the CS Group Beadle...so we had to prepared the directory stuff for our groups...its nice having Val do it [thanks Val]...so there...  Hmmm...Saturday was kinda fun...I went to a UAAP Game and Opening Ceremonies...  I had to wait for an hour for Ancar and Caren to turn up so I spent it reading a new acquisition from the library...its nice reading...um, I'll post it next time...When we finally met, we were like talking about stuff and comparing stuff and all...until we reached Araneta...  Upon reaching Cubao, we got my ticket and went to meet Ancar's friends who has their tickets...so we entered na and settled ourselves in the UP Crowd...we had to relocate about three times in order to be sure that we are in the UP side of the stadium...  It was kinda nice being part of the UP crowd...a crowd who is famous for their cheers (and not for their players...hehehe)...The Atenean block was super empty...owing to the fact that Ateneo has a game against La Salle today...today...as in today...which, on my regret, I can not watch...  So there...and I also found out that all schools [I think] raise their right fists and all when singing their respective Alma Mater Songs...[I thought only Ateneans do THAT for Song of Mary...di pala?!]  Tapos yun...When I went home I felt very much angry at that Express Teller terminal in Angono...It just kept saying transaction cancelled...so I couldn't withdraw money (which my mother was asking for)...damn!  Due to her mandate, I called up BPI and reported and stuff and even asked her what was the nearest branch and where was the next terminal and so on...However, my mother insisted (after I ended the call) that should have had pressed more on the operator for immediate action...right, like they could swoop down instantly to our terminal and fix the whole stuff...  Then, my father made me buy stuff, again to my repulsion, because I was doing school stuff, no kidding...  To add more to my angst, my mother did not allow me to watch the UAAP Game...Ateneo vs La Salle...which was one of the most awaited games...oooooh, damn!  even more anticipated than the finals...I'm actually praying now that Ateneo and La Salle both make it to the finals (which is not exactly plausible) so that I can watch their clash...  She even brought up the idea of me asking for permission to go out again the second time on the weekend...yeah right...there's not much to do...[well, there is a lot to do but only unimportant stuff]...  Oh shit...and to add to that...the Flash MX I installed in this damn stupid fucking PC is not working...bullshit! How can I work on my Guidon requirements without Flash MX...nothing to impress them...  On the brighter side, Guidon might actually just consume my time if I become accepted so its fine that I don't get accepted (I just lost a hundred bucks)...oh well...  So there...I'm thinking of posting pa later...I haven't ran out of anst just yet...
