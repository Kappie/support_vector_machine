Well I apolgize, power went out and I found that computers need power so I just stared at a black screen most of the weekend. Without power it gets boring pretty quickly so I resorted to playing tennis and walking around Bethesda.  the storm was wimpy yet still knocks area into chaos. so odd.  anyways come tuesday something interesting may happen that hopefully will go off right so wish me luck. :-)
