The teachers were totally scared of the monstrously lurchsome inhabitants of the mansion, but who they nonetheless had to comply to. They were eerie. Anyway, we all had our dorms, which were admittedly large, but for some reason we all just accepted (though disliked) these Lurchers kept wanting to inspect them, during which time all four inhabitants would line up with military sharpness while they came in.  Anyway, one time Alex invited me up to the top floor, but instead of going to see him, I got into Nick's room. The arrangement of people in there was weird: on my right was Stuart Watson, with massive hair. To the left was that guy from 6th form. I presume he was joining us on our field trip as a kind of peer envigilator, but I never questioned this in the dream. Nick was to the forward right, and Al Glaister was to the forward left, though he was absent from the room. Nick got me playing some kind of weird interactive video game, which I shall now proceed to fail to explain...  There was a large screen on which a weird bulldozer vehicle (one of the semi-devilicious ones you might see in The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror short 'Homega') with various traditional monster on board who had a kind of water pistol, which was what I 'fired' at. They also threw kinds of flamanges at me, which actually fell down on me in my chair, which was supposed to be my car. One of them was going to hit 'the car', so I held out my hand and knocked it to my left. There then followed a long arguement. Apparently, because it had "hit the wall of a Stannah stairlift" I had lost the point. Pointing out that there was neither a Stannah stairlift nor a wall there was pointless: there was one underneath the floor. Pointing out that carpet, floorboards and the ceiling separated the flamange from the wall of doom was also pointless. Then we decided to play another game, one in which Stuart and 6th form guy joined it. I can't remember how it went. I think 6th form guy was playing the part of an alien, and my part, when I asked, was irrelevent, other than that I had to follow the rules. They completely went over my head, but fortunately we were interrupted.  Unfortunately it was the lurching master manequins of the place. While the inspection was carried out, I was stuffed into the space behind the drawers in a bedside cabinet (Stuart's) where, to my shock, there was a naked person also hiding (it didn't occur to me to question why at the time - I was half asleep!). I did ask him why he hasn't escaped earlier, and he said that the Lurchers keep constant surveillance of the dorms beginning with an inspection, and going on for an indeterminate length, so if I myself were to leave the hiding spot immediately after the inspectors had gone, I'd be picked up on camera. Yeah, not so much logic, but then these big guys were freaky - there was definitely something spooky going on in this place. Needless to say I got caught.  I was dragged by two large brutes down the hall, but I was reaching out for Nick. I got dragged past my own dorm and somehow managed to bash open the doors and call out to him for help and stuff, but of course everyone was pretty dazed by it, and no doubt intimidated by the monstrous hulks. I broke into the next room along, too, which was Ed's, and somehow managed to stumble into it despite the two large beasts trying to hold me back. More of them were drafted in. (pause in typing while I'm invited into a mass convo.) So now I'm just getting desperate, and my desire not to get dragged away is just giving me superhuman strength. And more drones are pulling at me, until they stretch out the door (big rooms remember, and I'm reaching for Ed on the other side of it). They've lifted all my limbs off the ground, but they still can't pull me back.  Eventually someone decides to start a fight with these bozos, and everyone joins in, but eventually I get dragged away and taken down to the cellar. And that's basically as far as the dream went. Mum kept phoning me, since I've had to send my phone in for repairs (a broken 2 button) and my temporary replacement is actually blacklisted and won't connect to the Orange network, so I had to get up. It actually sounded like a decent premise for a film, but then this is coming from a guy who thought he could turn his life into a series of dramatic TV episodes.  Bah, another mass convo. I may have outed myself. I'll get back to you.
