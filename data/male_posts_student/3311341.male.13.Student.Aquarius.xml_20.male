I have no idea how it came up, but all of a sudden we where there playing it. Strange, huh?    I can beat 3-6 feet levels, which is satisfying considering my siblings are doing 1-2 feet levels. My dad, my brother Tap, and I are competing, but Tap is closest in skill to me. I want to get two pads to compete with him. ^_^    I missed Worship rehearsal, again, because Tap had to sound at our other church, so I had no ride. *sigh* It's probably mostly my fault, though.    We went to college orientation on Wednesday and Thursday. I only went on Thursday, but yeah, it was really fun. The people there were nice, but the dorms(Tap isn't staying on campus, anyway) remind me of dimly lit prisons. The walls are dull colored and the lighting is VERY non-existant. Pretty much a cave. The rooms are extremely small, too. I'm not going to that college. Or atleast not staying on campus.    The other activities there sound like fun, frequent sports games, music, other clubs. The staff said there were over 200 clubs there, and if you can't find one you fit into, then you can make your own and the university will give you $250 to fund. You have to find a couple more people within a week or two, to keep it, heh. Hmm, I want to go to the University of Phoenix, Arizona. Or something like that.    You see ads for it, everywhere. VG producing, music, and a bunch of other AWESOME stuff that I want to do. I might be an engineer of some sort, but I really enjoy interacting with musicians and playing music together. It feels good to be able to play a piece together after you've been practicing for months. ^_^ You'd never forget that. It's your own creation to be proud of.    Time to go eat breakfast. It's odd that I usually don't eat breakfast for a couple of hours after I wake up. I should eat first, but usually I head straight to the computer to do my little routine. And I'm probably gonna start doing a couple hours of DDR.   Ciao!
