O.k. so far, becasue of a whole lot of server errors, I have only been able to get the mmorpg beta and this blog setp. PZFN main will ahve to wait untill these server issues are resolved.    Once all that is taken care of I'll make sure that I optimize all the scripts (forums, etc...) so that they are better than ever. Also, to all you AcetoneRPG beta testers out there (and the respected wanna be's): I will be working more on the rpg in the coming weeks and also will be adding a new "Invite a Friend" function. Those of you that have gmail will know what this is... For all of you that don't know what this is, it is a way for beta testers to send out registration invitations to their friendsso thatwecanget morebeta testers. Anwaysbe sure to check out here,  urlLink PZFN.com  and the  urlLink AcetoneRPG Website for more details in coming weeks. Cya.
