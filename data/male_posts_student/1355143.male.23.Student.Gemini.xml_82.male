She is married to an Icelander and so is her aunt (i.e. a different icelander :) ).  She told me that in her city (can't remember the name of it) her aunt's husband runs a fast food restaurant called something like "sagas-fast-food" (as in the "icelandic sagas") which is in that city as known and "important" as Subway!  .... I'm telling you Icelanders are slowly but surely conquering the world! :)  So, my thesis is due in 14 hours. It is 3 a.m. right now and I am pretty sure I will be working on it for the next 14 hours straight!  Except for this one hour between 10-11a.m. Then, without hardly any sleep for the last week and no sleep for tonight I have to attend my second interview for a internship for the ministry of foreign affairs (or at least that is what I think that they call that ministry in english).  88 people applied, they interviewed 80 and now the group has shrunken down to the beautiful number of 15. Eight possisions are avaliable so my chances are pretty high... and the greatest thing of all is that there is this guy that applied from my school who I thought was the most eligible for the job BUT he is not in the group hahahahaha .... I am sooo mean :)  Well, if anyone thinks that this post is somehow wierd, nasty or badly spelled, I blame too much coffee, no sleep and my damm university for making us write a thesis - none of you have to write one - right?  anyway, take care, Svana
