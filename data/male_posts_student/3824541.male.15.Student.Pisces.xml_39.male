I hope you like the title.   Anyway, I've decided I'm not going to stress myself over the '.scene' thing. If I forget it then bleh. Bleh Bleh Bleh.  Speaking of stress, I handwrote 23 pages of homework today. 23 pages of wide-ruled notebook paper in a spiral notebook. 10 books of the Odyssey are done, and I have another 14 to do. I've been working on a graphic for my Odyssey journal, but I can't find the pictures I need. So, if you by any chance own like a picture farm with a picture of: Side profile of Poseidon's face, Side profile of some wind god dude, Athena's face OR a girl who likes like Athena. I don't expect anyobody to find them, but hey, it can't hurt to try.  Tomorrow I have a million things lined up, and I have a feeling I'll do two of them. Here's my list: A) Get a haircut B) Go clothes shopping C) Go to Crossroads fair D) Go to Mike's block party  In addition to that I'm going to have to breathe, eat, and probably use the bathroom. So, I've come up with this schedule:  9:00 Wake up 9:30 Do stuff 8:00 PM: Finish doing stuff 8:30 PM: Eat, breathe, go to bathroom 11:00 PM: Sleep  This way I won't lose track of what I'm doing. It's a good thing I'm organized... and hot.   Stuff.
