I can still smell you.      Me and Brice and Keith ate our Wendy's.  Then, Keith fell asleep and me and Brice reminisced.  We looked at all my old autographs and guitar picks.  We compared and even traded ticket stubs.  We ransacked the house looking for mementos.  I found quite a few.      I didn't do much of anything today, and it was fun.  I'm really sleepy, but I'm hungry too.  I can't go to sleep for an hour.      I jumped in the pool today for the first time.  It was really really cold.      I found out that Trapt is going to be in Morgantown the same night as me and Dustin.  I might have to go see them, for old times sake.      I'm going to go get something to eat now, I love you.  I hope you have or had fun at band and sectionals today.  Jamin, I hope you're ready to see Wilco.        I love everyone, goodnight.
