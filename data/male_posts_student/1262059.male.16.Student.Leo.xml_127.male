I still need to do a paragraph for history then work on math. I need to finish all this tonight for sure.    It's so weird.. lot'sa things are going wrong.. one of the worse things that could happen was someone losing all their units at this critical time of the year. I hope someone finds Joe's bag soon. At this point, I really couldn't care less if the person who took it got away free, even though Joe might take comfort in tearing that person apart. Justin's kinda mad too cause our (joe, me, him, brian) science lab was in there too.    Umm... everyone seems to be annoyed/mad at me today... maybe I'm doing something wrong..?    ~Chronos   ps despite all this, i hope everyone keeps a cheerful outlook ^^;;
