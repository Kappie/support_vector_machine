These past 2 years out of the 4, we were together out of convenience and fear of change. Les, you are not the one I've been thinking about. The next chapter of my life is just starting, without her (just the way it should be). I'm going to finish my med degree without her holding me back and I'm going to move back to CA where I belong.
