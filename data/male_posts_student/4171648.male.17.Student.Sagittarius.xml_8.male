Are some digging their own grave with useless spades? Challengers are struck off one by one Unwilling to take the risk To gamble everything they have worked for all their life Some think of their families back home Deciding those are riches that cannot be won Finally, only the most ruthless challenger remains He may have won this time Claims this WILL be the last time But he'll be back again To waste his money and lose his life    Playing poker
