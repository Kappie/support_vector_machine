I'm not exactly sure why I have a blog, but the little infoturial was just so entrancing that I just had to sign up. Well I have been bored recently, so what the hell, I'll give it a try. First, an introduction. I'm a guy living in america, in the state massathingy. I don't like america, and my lifelong dream is to move to canada. My political orientation, as close as I can figure, is liberal with a strong libertarian streak. I believe that most people, when you get down to it, are evil. Especially Americans. If someone went around offering $10 million dollars to Americans if they beat their mother with a baseball bat, I bet most would do it. I believe people are too materialistic, and I also believe that the giant corporations with tremendous amounts of money own the government, and the government rules the people with fear. I'm also a secular jewish atheist vegetarian. Wow I'm weird. Well that's it for now. I guess now it's time to sit back and wait for a movie deal or something...
