All of us were allowed to wear our home clothes. My 'gang' wore black shirts... So many ppl thought we were Mafia. -.-" Pretty lame though... I realised that I'm not as sociable in JC than I was in BHSS. Owned. ;( Kinda hate the feeling of not knowing alot of ppl in sch. Sux. Time flies and it has been 4 months since my JC started. My best buds just started poly not long ago... Feeling pretty distant from them. I talked to them online but still, the memories of chilling outside still remain inside me. Gonna ask them out and do some shet wif them. Well, I didn't know they were kinda desperate to be in relationship. We chatted about being a 'playAr'. Lol. Feggots. Though I didn't really agree to that idea, I can't stop them from doing wadever they wanna do. ;P CHILLING TIME!!!
