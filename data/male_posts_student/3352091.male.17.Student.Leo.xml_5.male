We can have a decent talk about emotions and human behavior and stuff its really relieving to know their is someone of the opposite sex that feels the same about some subjects lol. So many people so little time. No one can know all their is to know, but the best thing we can do with what we do know is enhance someone else's knowledge and further them along the path that we perhaps didnt get to due to our short time here on eart(100 years)  "I hope you dont mind, I hope you dont mind that I put down in words, how wonderful life is, now you're in the world"
