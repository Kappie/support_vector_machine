So, this is my first post and I'd like to start out by giving a mission statement. My mission in writing in this blog is to keep the public entertained. If I wanted to tell the whole world exactly what I was feeling at all times I wouldn't need a private journal. I'm sure no one wants to know how I'm feeling about stupid shit anyway.   On to the entertainment...  Haha, really I have nothing much to say at this time. All I can really think of is that drugs are really bad for you. Anything that distorts your perception and harms your body at the same time can't be good at all. I'm sure all of you are thinking now, "Bryan, you're such a hypocrite, I've seen you drinking at dozens of occasions. I've even seen you smoking a couple of times." I am not saying that I do not do this things. All I'm saying is that they can't be too good. I really don't enjoy smoking, even if I'm surrounded by all my closest friends. I just feel tired and my feeling of touch is greatly enhanced. Like I was in the shower last time and I pretty much feel asleep standing up in the shower thinking to myself, "this feels SOOOO weird!" I'm glad that I never really smoked on a constant basis or I'd turn out to be a snow bunny like so many other people I know. Drinking is fun. As long as you don't go overboard and you know your limit and you don't drink everyday, it's fun.  I'm gonna go pass out because I had a full day of practice (swimming)630-4. Bullshit
