YEAH i conquered the lab myself... with the music blasting my ears... haha... musics save my life... but sadly... another hour to go, i hve to see those noisy n talkative students..sighzzz...  Anyway, i m looking forward to this upcoming carnical on this saturday... one thing i feel weird about is that this carnival started at 8am till 1pm.. emm.... at such an early morning... i dun feel like buying anything to eat these time... but my students keep on running to me for the coupons... :((  there's another one month to go for my training... hahah... finally can release myself... during the 3 weeks break, must really spend the time wisely... haha...
