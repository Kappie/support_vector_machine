Today i stole 2 houses in UO it was very exciting for me because 2 houses full of stuff is worth alot of money in the world of UO.  Today i also watched the movie Mystic River.  It was an excellent movie done by Clint Eastwood.  I thought the entire movie was excellent except for one part where a teen finds out his friend and brother killed his gf and he punches his friend in the face like at least 20 times, and kicks his brother in the head a good 7-8 times.  I kinda felt like i could feel him kicking me but i dont know i just did not like it at all.  Sean Penn and Tim Robbins were excellent at acting out the parts of these peoples lives.  I cannot wait to get out to goto the river with my friends tomorrow it has been a week since i got shitfaced at Russells LOL.  Well im out  Chris  Going to bed
