Also, Mattson, Jason said you were trying to get off work so you could go to the races on Saturday. Why can't you go to the races Saturday, and work Sunday. If you don't come, I'll be all alone with Lewis and your mom Sunday morning. Who knows what kind of crazy stuff could happen.  For Mattson: have you gotten to the hidden cave in the Thunder Plains yet? It is the worst thing ever. Not only do you have to do a lot of math, but it takes forever. And you have to do it twice.
