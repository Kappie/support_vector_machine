That was just the  BEST  movie......wow, talk about messin' with your head though.  If you've ever seen The Animatrix and you see this movie and you don't connect them in your head. You're  FSKING  retarded. Just....wow.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone. Even if you're already deathly afraid of robots taking over the world and you're the only one who suspects anything. >:-D  ya...that's pretty much it.  Everyone is leaving..I don't understand it! Everyone is goin' out of town for the weekend and such. Damn you people. I leave August.....8th? sure, 8th for Utah and then come back on the 12th or sumthin'....just a short little visit. I have no idea why. My family is makin' me go.   I GET MY BRACES OFF ON TUESDAY!!!!!! \/\/007!    Tomorrow,  July 17th , is the day that will live in infamy(sp?) The day that my brain officially exploded. Only 2 hours away. If you guys don't hear from me for a while and hear that I'm in a hospital dying slowly....you'll now know exactly why.  Boy, would that just suck  @$$... I finally become happy for a while, and everything*psh, everything. HA!* is going great! Then I die....geez that would suck a whole lot. On that happy note: Bye!  Spense
