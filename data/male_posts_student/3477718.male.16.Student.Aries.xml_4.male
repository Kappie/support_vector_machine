No more tears streamming down my face. No more being labled such a disgrace. So as I leave there will be no golden sun. No shining star. I've convinced myself, I've gone too far. The gun to my head, the tears in my eye. I've left this world without saying goodbye. -------------------------------------------- Give me your input on it guys.
