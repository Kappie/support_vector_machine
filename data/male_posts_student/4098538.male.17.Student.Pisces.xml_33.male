Several badly failed attempts of breaking us up have been made by a bunch of people with WAYYYYY too much time on their hands whoshould just begin to get over it. Oh, Adam (Banister)... you forgot to keep the part about you threatening to slit your wrists over Mandy and the part about me keeping my business out of what you and Mandy talk about when you happily read the conversation between two people that have nothing to do with any of you anyway. If any of you wanna read the WHOLE conversation and not the edited last half of it, ask Mandy for it =)  PS -Next time any ofyou wanna threaten / insult me, do it to my face instead of behind a keyboard, it's pretty cowardly. xx
