Now, I'm awake, a little energetic, fever's gone for a while, but maybe not for long.  My typing is too slow for me.  I find no energy, really, to do certain actions.  I forced myself out of bed, the only time I had forced myself, because probably I WAS TOO WEAK to resist myself.  Pitiful.  I would have enjoyed the bed if...   I could have written or read, but the headache made it all go blurry and stupid.  Go to hell, Satan!  I send you back to your friggin hell!  Stop sending me those plagues out of your contempt for humanity!  Waittaminute.  Wasn't it God who used to send plagues?        ...
