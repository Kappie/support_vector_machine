Here's the first rule of "Kai-ism":   How to wash your car -   "Only wash and polish the front and back."    Why? Cos the front is the only thing they'll see on their rear view mirror when you come charging up from behind. And your rear is the only thing they will see as they eat your dust..............What about the side? Cos you'll be too fast when overtaking them.
