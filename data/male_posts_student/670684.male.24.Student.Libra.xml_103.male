I post this for several reasons: one, to encourage any Austinites to attend this rally...with the advent of the internet, protesters can now  urlLink communicate  with one another and make their message more powerful.  But also, I am interested in the author's ideas of using protest as a panacea for societal ills.    I am an artist, and as an artist, I feel I have a social obligation to discuss reality and the misperceptions that our societal institutions feed us on a daily basis...I color life a little darker, but I try to say that the facade of brightness is worse than an actuality that is just a bit darker.  Thus, my feature-length films are all dramatic; I only do comedy in short format (which should be a relief to many of my friends).  One of the issues I am facing at present is writing about the current political situation we are in today.  I hate American foreign policy, and I hate the plastic World's Police monogram we throw on everything, when in fact we're fighting for " our interests " rather than humanity (quick lesson - "our interests" does not have much to do with solving world hunger or other problems).  I am trying to come up with a screenplay idea that tackles the current state of issues in America and abroad, and being a 23 year old white male who has lived in the South for 10+ years, it is difficult to gain the adequate perspective.    So why am I about to bash protesters, when they are making a more conceited effort to do something than I am?  Because I see little change coming from the majority of protests issued.  This protest of the vandalism of the MLK statue (a beautiful  urlLink statue  near the East Lawn on campus) is fine in order to vent frustration and gain a sense of community, but to expect that the capture of the vandals will be aided by this rally is preposterous.  At a campus of over 50,000, it is more than likely that the perps will be caught, regardless of the rally staged.    I'm more than likely arguing semantics here, but I think it's important.  Protests rarely change anything.  The 1963  urlLink March on Washington  was a protest that helped spur the Supreme Court to come to action with Brown vs. Board of Education, and to me, that's how a protest should be done.  Make it a big deal, get the biggest names you can to speak, and hold it in one area and one area only: the Capitol Mall.  If there were a War on Terror protest in Washington, D.C., and heads of state and big-name activists would come to speak, I would pilgimmage to D.C. to see it, no doubt.  Sheer numbers speak to politicians and the media, not 200 people sauntering down a street, more interested in getting to know the folks next to them rather than stopping an injustice.    Protests are a way to spur community and vent frustration.  And there is nothing wrong with that; in fact, there is a lot right with that.  It's like me and this blog.  Would I like this blog to change the world?  Hell yes.  Will it?  No way.  It's my personal feelings, that might get famous someday and there might be a lot of hits to this site, but that is incredibly doubtful.  But, it makes me feel better, it makes me articulate myself, and for that it's a good thing.  Same thing with protests.  But if you want to change the world, you've got to work past the feeling of complacency that you get by writing a blog or marching in a rally.  Because when people think that they're solving the world by painting a sign, marching with 20 friends, and getting beers afterwards, that's a detriment to any movement...the protest is where the fight  begins ...much work is left to be done after everyone marches.    I was gonna bitch about being sick.  Oh well.
