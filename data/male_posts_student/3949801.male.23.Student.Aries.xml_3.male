I am hoping that it will be real good because if it's not the scene there could get ugly.  Then I will stock up on lots of liquor and have a drinking/chinese action film party at a friend's house.  I am hoping everything will go smoothly and that the Indian food and alcohol will settle nicely together in my stomach.
