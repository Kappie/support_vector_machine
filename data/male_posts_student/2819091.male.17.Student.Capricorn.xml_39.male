I used to think it was some form of redemption, Like my sins are removed and I am finally free from it. That the people I wronged have finally forgiven me. I don't know...  I'm a fool, A stupid little boy constantly imagining the impossible. A boy who loved to think he was a hero, A boy who is loved by everyone, hated by no one. These are just stupid little thoughts from a little boy...  Here is now how that young boy thinks: Will anyone ever forgive me for my stupidity? Will anyone ever pardon my foolishness? Will my sins ever wash away so I may be free? Will it ever rain for me?
