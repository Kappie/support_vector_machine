Got back from Geyser Falls yesterday, I have a Jermy Camp concert this Thursday, and Friday me and Tiff J. are going to a dinner with some people from our church. But, it is still up in the air if she can go or not because she still has to ask her parents. Anywho, I would say this is going to be a much better year than last year. I'm so excited. It will be hard but it will be worth it.
