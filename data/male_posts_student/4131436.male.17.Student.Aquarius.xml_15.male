We played PS2 together..Kinda fun having some company.. Always alone at home..In my room..Hahaha!! Well..Had pizza for breakfast and went to school for this class.. At first I was thinking of not going but I changed my mind.. I went and it was worth it!! The class was small and very interesting.. The teacher was the husband of my Mother Tongue teacher.. He's cool.. Tought us ways of handling daily lives. Stress all that stuffs.. How to plan your schedule.. It's more like a workshop to me.. But no matter.. It's worth it and I learnt more about myself. Then after class.. Nashir and me went to have early lunch.. Cause it's near 12pm.. Wahahaha!! He kept on bragging bout being late to meet Michelle at Clementi Central. And he was eating so rushingly that his chin (got a bit of beard) was messingly full of curry...Hahahaha!!! It's kinda funny till he told me Jenni was nearby.. It suddenly changed my mood a bit.. But I can't see her as the bush is blocking my view.. I don't wanna know anymore.. Her image was banished from my mind.. I'm trying my best to forget her.. Concentrate on myself now.. She e-mailed me saying that I spread rumours about me and her going to the Prom Night together to Amanda.. Alright.. First of all.. I haven't talked to Amanda for a while now.. And second of all is that I lost my phone and no ways of me to memorising her number telling her that I'm going to the Prom Night with Jenni.. Please... *sIgHzZ* Rumours....But most of all is that I'm through with Jenni.. She said if she was going there.. She'll be going with her friends.. So..?? Am I going to beg her to go with me? HELL NAH... Like I have no friends like that... Bleah!! I don't wanna talk bout her anymore.. Well.. It's a cool day today.. So..Later... Peace Out!!
