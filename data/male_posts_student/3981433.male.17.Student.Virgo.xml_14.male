Ex-history teacher is writing my UCAS reference. saw his yesterday and he said that i had a good chance of getting into UEA, plus its an unpopular university and thy have great resourses apparently...might be worht a look. Dad's obsessed with pushing me to look at Aber-bloody-yriswith or however the hell you spell it... but the truth is that i'll be the first of our family to go straight from 6th form to university - so its not like he knows what hes really talking about... my fathers not a fool - dont get me wrong - probably just a lil misguided.  oh the shitty weather. oh time for a shower
