Every rip into a new universe causes that universe to begin to decay also.  Other universes touching against that reality also have rips formed to them,  and in turn begin to decay. Once all the universes are infected the  omniverse will be a free-flowing torrent of ideas and possibilities, shared  tested and experienced in on instant, the ultimate Chaos and the ultimate  Order simultaneously.  Until then, naturally, all the inhabitants of each world are naturally a  little concerned.  There is a way to repair the fabric, but this technique takes a day to close  one rip (during which time every infected universe will have created  another).  There may be a way to slow, or stop, the decay, but this has not yet been  discovered. (hint: It will be. May involve other universes or magic. not  decided.)
