Well I should be asleep but I thought, well it wouldn't do much harm to stay up a lil more and write out a lil bit tonight -grins-  I always seem to say the same thing on weekends, hah..well actually the weekend has passed and its back to Monday blues? Hmm thoughts of lectures with D math and C prog -grr- frustrating sometimes, but still I'm gonna keep trying trying trying ya! heh.  I don't want to give up, not ever.  Time has passed so quickly again, tests are coming pretty soon and I'll have to start preparing now cuz I still feel i'm quite behind my syllabus.  The best thing about Monday's is that I will be seeing xiaowei! hehe...sending her home, that's my privilege -smiles- I remember how it felt when the hols ended, or when you started school and I had to wait for mine. I picked you up from school almost everyday, it was a wonderful feeling actually, to be able to send your girlfriend home safe and sound. Even if all I had was about half-an-hour everyday, I felt happy, happy to learn to cherish even the shortest moments with you. Yet, sometimes the shortest moments with you are the most beautiful ones. You would rest your head on my shoulder and sometimes fall asleep so peacefully, and when the sun comes out i'll cover your eyes so that the glaring light doesn't get in your eyes. Then, there would be times we would spend the whole 30 mins we have on the bus sharing very cold jokes, the very dry type, spelled as L-A-M-E. Hah, we'd spend all the time laughing over how ridiculous the joke is and I would kiss you on your cheek all of a sudden. You look so beautiful when you're shy, maybe cuz that's when you don't hide anything, nothing at all, you're free -grins-   I love you  .  We spent the whole of Saturday together and you don't know how important it was to me to be able to see you, it was hard really, hard when you felt so negative the previous couple of days and I, I felt like I just couldn't cheer you up at all.  I really needed to see you smile.  Like all Saturdays, or the weekends we've spent together, nothing could be better than to have you right by my side, holding on to my arms, and sometimes sharing the sweetest embrace. Even times when we spend our days watching VCDs at home, or just lie on the bed and listen to the music on the radio, its never boring, I could never get tired of you, never. There's just something so special about you that sets you apart from any other girl, or even person i've ever met in my entire life.  I don't know how you make me feel that way, neither do I know why I feel that way, but I simply love it and cherish it.  You are special.  Weekends are best, and the reason is you.     I had steamboat earlier with my friends, it was Mei ling's birthday! hah, happy birthday to her. Amy, Mich, Xing, Lixuan, Jon and Mei ling were all there and we ate so much, hah but all that smoke made my shirt smell -bleh-  Time to sleep, the clock struck 12 an hour ago.    baby, did you know I live my life for you? You are everything to me.          Everything I cherish and never could afford to lose.
