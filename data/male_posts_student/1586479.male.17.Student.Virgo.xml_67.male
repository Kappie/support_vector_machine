Did you know you could make a stun-gun out of a disposable camera. So soon camera's will be banned from airplanes along with nail clippers. Yay America! Thanks Osama...  I'm done trying to be artsy. I'm ready to start being.  I loved the Elephant Man. It rocked my socks off, and I've yet to find them. When Conner said it was "a bunch of crippled people dancing around," I thought 'oh great, its gonna be weird.' Well the transitions were, but they freaking ROCKED. I loved it. Oh man.... wow.  My great plans for the rest of the night after the play died though because everyone had to go home. So boo.  I am sick. I can hardly get up. Typing is a strenuous activity.  I am growing my hair out again.
