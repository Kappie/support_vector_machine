Not because of some one or something, but because i am. i am inherently happy because on nights like these i feel my soul open up and bear itself with all its beauty and madness. I wish people could see it or feel it. All the positive energy with in me, not marred by my insecurities or fears, my imperfections and frustrations, my darkness and my doom. it is just me. and all the light within me. all the beauty i contain. and i dont mean physical beauty. if you could only see it, you would not wonder what makes me a happy person, and it is not because of my tangible assets that i deem it so. it is deeper, more crucial than that. experience has taught me that my inner beauty can be exploited. some people drink up what they can not have. withdrawal symptoms have been... unpleasant.
