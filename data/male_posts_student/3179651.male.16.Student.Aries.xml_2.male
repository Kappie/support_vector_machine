Here is Mia, getting her nails done.  urlLink Click for Mia    After I told Mia to ask how much a French manicure is over a regular one, she got one. They look so much nicer than acrylic nails do on most people.    Process:   The highlights in the hair were intensified, and I made use of the channel mixer to bring out her skin and get rid of the fluorescent light glow it reflected. I also toned down the light a big and corrected the color on the ladies shirt.    Edit:   There wasn't much color on her hand due to the light, so i am going to start over from the original tomorrow and fix the image.    Beth however, looked great in acyrlics.  urlLink Click for Beth   They are both smiling because the lady was laughing at me taking pictures.   Mia made me!    Process    I left the nails in color to make them stand out. I used quick mask to isolate the nails, then used channel mixer on the rest of the picture in monotone. Then I fine tuned using the desaturating sponge tool and quick mask to desaturate around the nails.. I booted saturation, contrast and brightness around the nails to show them off a bit more, and got rid of the lights reflection on the white part, which made them look yellowish. Took me 15-30 minutes. General unsharp mask applied as always to make the subject pop out a bit more. I'll add my borders/logo in a few.    Later I'm going to make a crop of Mia and turn it into a b glamour shot.  I think these would look good as 8x10s, so if anyone wants a copy tell me! I have the high resolution copies.
