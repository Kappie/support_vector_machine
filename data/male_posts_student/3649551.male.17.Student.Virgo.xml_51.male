It's a book about ancient Chinese military strategy. It sounds obscure and very boring, but this stuff can easily be applied to everyday life. All one has to do is view the battles it speaks of as daily struggles. It's great stuff. "Being unconquerable lies with yourself; being conquerable lies with the enemy." I like that one. I can't control other people, but I can control myself. "Thus the army does not maintain any constant strategic configuration of power, water has no constant shape." People should always be changing - stubbornly holding to views that no longer make sense isn't being strong, it's being stupid. Somebody whose views change over time is not a hypocrite. "Thus the pinnacle of military deployment approaches the formless. If it is formless, then even the deepest spy cannot discern it or the wise make plans against it." The advantages of staying mysterious until you choose to make yourself known. I find myself using this one in social situations. Anyway, it's a good book and isn't very lengthy. Cut out the commentary and boring drawl of the preface, introduction, historical introduction, another introduction, notes on the translation, blah blah blah, and it's deep stuff.
