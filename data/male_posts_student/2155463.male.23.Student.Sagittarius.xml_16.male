Swim - "Girlfriend"   "Room 421, an airport hotel, I know I should be sleeping, But it's too soon to tell, If I fly out tomorrow, If I see her tomorrow, I hope that I will...  There's no place like alone, There's no sound like my own, My own voice fading into a quiet December night, But I'm doing all right, I'll make a phone call or two, I've got a wonderful view...  Could I get some room service please? Just send the maid in to see if I'm still alive, At a quarter 'til five, If I'm still right here, Debating a year, Serenading the mirror....  Bring me my girlfriend, And a bottle of wine, Bring me a future, Just make sure it's mine Will you open the window, But leave out the cold? Could I make a phone call to Jesus, To clean up my soul?  Miles from my own bed, Further from content, I guess I should get used to this, Still rain on the runway, But I'm doing ok, I've got cigarettes to kiss.  Could I get some room service, please? I'm down on my knees, I'm only here for a night, 'Cuz they screwed up my flight,  So could you bring me my girlfriend? And a bottle of wine, Bring me a future, And just make sure it's mine Will you open the window, But leave out the cold? Could I make a phone call to Jesus, To clean up my soul?  I'd settle for a Savior soul-keeping, please, Could you put me through to Jesus, I'd pay the long-distance fees, He said, "Hello" and "God bless you, there's a Bible in the drawer..." That's wonderful, sir, But I don't read it any more...  Just bring me my girlfriend, And a bottle of wine, Bring me a future, Just make sure it's mine Will you open the window, But leave out the cold? Could I make a phone call to Jesus, To clean up my soul?
