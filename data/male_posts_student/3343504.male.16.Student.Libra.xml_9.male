Glittering .. wow..  i belive that everybody in this world will at least have a star that belongs to him or her only , at least one ... while some will have more and some will have less but everybody will at least have one of his or her own star ...  to me , stars will bring us sweet dreams with the moon and starz will bring us good luck ...our start will always be by our side when we are lonely or when we are sad or happy and just feeling normal  , never gonna leave us ... aint starz great???   stars will also bring us happiness ... right???  but some times starz will also have their own dayz when they aint feeling happy ... so when ever i dont see the stars at night in the sky ... they arent happy ... but the next night,  u will see them in the sky again and their unhapiness are all gone. thatz why i say starz aint litte petty starz ... they live everyday as happy as they can be ...  i hope that everybody can be like every of their starz ... live happly every day with no worries ...  thankz my little star...
