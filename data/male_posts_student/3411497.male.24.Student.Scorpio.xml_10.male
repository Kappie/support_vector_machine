If you're tired, you go to sleep.  You'll feel better when you wake up.  If you feel a little sick, you sleep more, and feel better.  It's an odd process, really -- to drive the point home, I think if I were ever rich and famous I'd have a special sleep chamber with a bunch of tubes and bubbles -- I'd tell reporters that "at night, this is where I rejuvenate."  I found out last night that I have a fan!  And not just a fan, but a Number-One Fan!  Part of me wonders if it may be a bit early for me to have fans, but at the same time, is it really ever too early to have fans?  The world might be a lot better place if everybody were more willing to be fans of other people... actually, come to think of it, it wouldn't be.  There are some pretty cool guys that used to live on this planet, and their fans are fucking it up for everybody -- and yes I prefer to call these people "fans".  You know what I've noticed as I've grown up?  I'm not sure if I remember the specific moment I realized this, but it was a momentous revelation that flew in the face of everything I thought I knew:  grown-ups are just making it up as they go along .  If anybody is in charge of anything, they're just making it up.  They don't actually know what to do, they're just giving it a shot.  Trying to avoid a war?  Well shit, they'll do their best.  It's kind of strange to look back on youth and remember having the concept of 'right and wrong' explained to you, realizing that the person telling you about it was more indictable by their definition than you were.  It's very strange being trapped here.  I find it very believable that human beings descended from monkeys, because if monkeys were in charge, things would probably look a lot like this -- a lot of whooping, and a lot of feces-throwing.  On the one hand, it's very interesting.  On the other hand, I kind of want out.
