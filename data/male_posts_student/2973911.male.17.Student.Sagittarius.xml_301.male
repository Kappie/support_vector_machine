We have these reasons for living, for keeping ourselves alive, but then, I don't really blah, blah,blah,blah,blah...  I know you don't want to hear all that  "Philosophical Bullcrap"  (as one of our friends in Soul Sanctum puts it).  Anyway, the point is, what if life has no purpose other than pure existence.  You know, like the appendix.  Hey, great news for highschool students!!! FEU - FERN College, located at Sampaguita Avenue, Mapayapa Village, Quezon city will soon become the first wireless college in the Philippines!!!  I think.  Or maybe in Quezon city?  Whatever.  The point is, just slap that PCMCIA thing that works like a radio and connects to the network hub of the school, and you get free net!!!   What is that thing called again?  I only remembered it being named as "radio".  stupid short term memory.  Anyway, stuff will be modernized there so fast, you might see the school of tomorrow standing on that lot before you can say "Charles Babbage!".   Hehe.  So much for plugging.
