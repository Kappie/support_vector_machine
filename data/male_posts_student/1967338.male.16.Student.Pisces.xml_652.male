I seriously think it could work as a musical.  The "weiner wort", of course, refers to what they put in the sausages.  It's a great book, but it'll be weeks before I can eat another sausage.  In other news, guess what one of our numbers for the fall choir show is gonna be?  Hint: It was the title of an episode of  Sports Night .  There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!
