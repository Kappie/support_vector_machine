Only problem when she left to go home, i felt as if i had lost a part of me, a part of who i am. She's one of my greatest friends and i'm afraid of losing her again like i did. I'm not to sure what i should do, we're both going to be extremly busy this year as it's our graduating year and i just want to be with her. I dont want to lose contact with her for over a year and never see her again. She means to much to me and i think she knows that. Right now i'm lost and dont know what i can do exactly to counteract this feeling of loss. I wish we could see more of each other, hopefully we will in the future. I love her to much to let her go.
