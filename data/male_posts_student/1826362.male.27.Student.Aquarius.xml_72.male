It is one of the most beautiful things I've ever read, and I know that that sounds completely phoney and trite.  I don't have anything like the ability to describe this book.  I think it is as good as anything written by an American.  It is an incredibly patient book though; I'm not saying that you shouldn't read it on the subway, just that I think you'll get a lot more out of it if you read it in a quiet room somewhere.
