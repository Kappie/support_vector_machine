I figure I should put them up for the world to see =)  in chronological order:   urlLink Fairies  (1997) All you need to know about this is the chorus:   Fairies, coming to get me Fairies, coming to kill me Fairies, coming to get me Fairies, everywhere man, yeah    urlLink FYE  (1998, and I've forgotten what the name means, too)   urlLink Hearts  Flowers  (1998, complete with Sonic the Hedgehog guitar solo)   urlLink Jealousy  (1998)   urlLink 47  (1999)   urlLink Sift  (1999)   urlLink  Die For You  (2000)   urlLink Sacred Me  (2000 - my last song with lyrics (which are embedded in the MIDI file))  If I ever find the lyrics for these songs I'll put them up somewhere...
