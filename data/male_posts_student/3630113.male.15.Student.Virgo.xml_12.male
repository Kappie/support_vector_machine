Don't think she regards punctuality as vital as a virtue as compared to ang.lol. ah well...english lessons more or less quite orthodox most of the time...there's this sense of indolence in the class...no one actually listens...and she starts asking ppl to stand up and talk bout something...zZzzz....  PE...height and weight...lol..we got to play soccer first...so ya...having 30 odd people chasing a ball on a field one-quarter the size of a normal football field...isn't exactly the most fascinating game on earth. so ya...odd-number ppl (my team) won 3-0. lol. we didn't have a goalkeeper at all..they didn't even attempt a shot as far as i'm concerned...lol...so well...i don't know why i made a sliding tackle on BK..they said it wasn't worth it. I think so now. argh. now my wound has been exposed once again...and i think it's really prone to getting infected...uh-oh. took height and weight...wah...everyone started laughing when my height was announced...not cuz i'm the shortest in the class cuz i ain't...but cuz i seemed tobe the only one who grew taller...lol..lotsa ppl had shrunk i think...or i guess there was something wrong with the tape or sth..  Went back to class to play sepak takraw(is this how u spell it?)...wah...sorry zhao wei..hit u so many times...hah....and anw...we did pretty well...colin was more or less the achilles' heel of our almost perfect juggling transition from one person to the next.hehe. Can i proudly announce myself as the sepak takraw club chairman? hehe....nah...i dun think i deserve that role...hehe...  assembly later was almost completely crap and a total waste of time...the first half an hour was wasted listening to crap that didn't in the least concern us. can't believe it...was just ranting...and wongsm was unhappy bout it...wth...mok as usual wasn't exactly much favoured by the audience...it was all the usual crap bout results and stuff we didn't have to know...bout discipline and stuff...i can gather all that easily from the net...zzzz...  at least she showed us this really inspiring and astonishing video that featured this person who seemingly only had body parts above the waist. omg..he's hilarious...despite his incapacity...and his deficiencies...he was living life the way he wanted to live life...he was happy bout the way he lived life...attitude made the difference...and he was really stout...his arms were so damn muscular u could compare them to a weight-lifter. i mean...obviously they are strong since he uses them as legs for walking...omg...he really displayed utmost tenacity and resilience...he had a couple of quotes...these are just vague impressions of 'em...:  "Live life the way you want to live life...don't let life live you."  "There's always a way to deal with things(or something like that)...underneath..through or over them."(haha sounds crap..i know..my memory ain't that good)  can't believe it..wongsm made us write ying yong wen...just when all my composition flair had dried off and my brain had seemingly become desiccated...void of substance...lol. I took quite a long time to write it..longer than usual at least...and omg..last 2 periods loke came in again...wah...write another essay...time trial at the same time...narrative too...i don't quite like narrative...but i think today's work has made me change my impression of 'em. hah. I thought of the movie starring brendan fraser and joe pesci which featured a harvard student helping a bummer and the bummer helping the harvard student and the reverse again...a really touching story...and i altered and condensed the story till it fit the title of "repaying a kindness" haha...i think i lacked some details..but i guess it'll do fine...  got back 2 chinese tests...88 and 89...not as good as i expected..(dun come walloping me) cuz i was expecting for 90s...argh...i need to get a high A this term for chinese...oh well...we had to study these sentences and memorise them and regurgitate themduring the testthis friday..wth man...and we had to made a duplicate of an essay she gave us...wat the hell man...wrote till my fingers became numb...obviously it wasn't an exact replica of the essay...lots of us were just scribbling through and the words simply didn't make much sense due to the sloppy writing...hah.  den later wongsm noticed my sepak takraw in the locker..wat the hell man....think she has eyes of her hawk..oh ya...she has 3 pairs of eyes...;) den wth...she confiscated it...and oh well coerced us to make a pact with her...must say i kinda initiated it...cuz i wanted the ball back...that any damage made to the notice board...we would sort of mend back those sheets of vanguard...i think she sorta wanted the entire thing to be refurbished.argh.killing 2 birds with one stone eh. so well...couple of us wrote our names down..and wth...jonny wrote it...under wong's instruction..and said that any damage made to class property including notice board would be our responsibility to recondition the stuff.wat crap man. it's ok..i think other than jonny no one else would be able to comprehend his handwriting...hehe...  went to play basketball...wah...scored damn nice shots..hehe...in a very good mood cuz i haven't played in a long time...and the ball dipped in with a ear-pleasing "swish"...hehe...b-e-a-utiful...  oh well...i guess attitude matters alot...that's what i've learnt...gotta make the best out of life...we only live life once at least that's what we understand...and opportunities come and go...so gotta make good use of them...whatever happens try to be happy...otherwise one mishap may trigger another...so when the warning signs start flashing...be on your wary and be cautious and handle the issue delicately...dun let it exacerbate till the situation cannot be salvaged. Don't let sad matters get in the way...they are just part of the process that understanding that life is beautiful and we should treasure these beautiful items in life. what's meant to be is meant to be...and i guess timing has to be impeccable for certain issues to really work well. Time controls everything...probably we have to be patient...but we also have to manipulate time in our favour as well. I guess...that's the most i can expect..i can't afford to sink into oblivion and let emotions control my attitude...it should be the other way round...it's an important period of time...and i'll continue to wait...
