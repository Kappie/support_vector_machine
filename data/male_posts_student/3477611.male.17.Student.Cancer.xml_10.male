Why can’t you realize that You’re holding all my strings. Come down from your high pedestal now! Your beauty instills this usual.  Ill swallow this gun tonight. Unload this lead, Unload it right into my head. Swallow down so  That this world might fade. This pain is usual Why wont it fade?  Twisting me this way and that, Does it feel good having this much power. The wind blows through your hair So wonderful…God must be there, He must have sent you, angel… You must be meant for me. But no, It’s just so usual.  Ill swallow this gun tonight. Unload this lead, Unload it right into my head. Swallow down so  That this world might fade. This pain is usual Why wont it fade?  Your eyes pierce me, Rip through my heart. Turning from me constantly, You find pain. You get hurt. Guess who’s there to comfort you? But to you…I’m just usual.  Ill swallow this gun tonight. Unload this lead, Unload it right into my head. Swallow down so  That this world might fade. This pain is usual…why wont it fade?  Swallow down so That this world might fade. This pain is usual, and it will fade.     here ends the love making session
