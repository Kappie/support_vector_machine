If 14 days have passed and you have not received this notice, you may wish to verify or update your address.        Speaks for itself doesn't it?!  BEER TIME!!  Sheldon's flights here were disrupted last night because his first flight to Chicage was late.  Mum told him about the approval on the phone.  I hope he gets here really soon!
