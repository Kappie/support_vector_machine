We have been waiting for too long for this month since its the ending and can make some preparations for the babies arrival.  As you can see we have started on the babies room recently and eventhough the baby will sleep in our room for first couple of months.  Dharmesh and I go in that room everyday and feel our baby presence.  Its also sad in a way to see the crib empty. Just another month or so then we will have the most precious and adorable baby whom will love more than our selves.   Its too bad Dharmesh can not feel what I feel and I am not talking about getting sick or anything, I mean the babies movements.  In a way I should actually feel lucky that my first and second trimester went fine, I didnt have any health problems or particular sicknes.  The pregnancy is SO FAR going smoothly, I just hope labor goes smoothly too.  Will worry about that when the time comes!!  Right now I should enjoy the wonderful feeling I feel during pregnancy, for instance just sitting at work or at home, seeing my stomach goes pop from one side to another...or sometimes some air pops (like the baby farted) or a feeling weird stuff deep inside the stomach (that feeling I dont like, its very annoying because I cant make it stop)  It feels like she is scratching the womb to annoy me, and it WOrks everytime.   The recent experiment I experienced was baby getting startled.  I was cleaning up things going up and down stairs, I suddenly feel baby hardening from time to time from moving fast or from loud noices.  Well  as you know ME being a genious, I made some noices with the chair downstairs or got up quickly and every time the baby hardens, hehe...its kinda cute feeling.  I did that couple of times to see if she can hear that, and it turns out she can recognize loud noises (Dont worry I read loud noises will not harm the baby)   ANyways thats enough for today we shall update next time @@@  Mommy Dearest !!
