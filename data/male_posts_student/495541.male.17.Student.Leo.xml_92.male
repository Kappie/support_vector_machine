I hate getting up early but I guess that's just something I gatta do every now and then.  Practice sucked, but oh well.  After that I just hung our for several hours.  Then I had dinner which was a sandwich and some Cheez-Its.  It was alright.  Then Whitney came over and we played Xbox for about 3 hours.  It was fun :-)  That's about it.  Night.
