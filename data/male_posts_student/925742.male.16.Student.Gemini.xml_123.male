But I hate it when Halo, Counter-Strike:CZ, Planetside, and NWN: Shadows of Undrentide, are all coming out within a month. I need money.  So I am gonna charge 5 bucks to anyone wanting a copy of Ut2003... ill give you the discs, u install it and get a cd crack. i return the game when I'm done, and ill get a majority of my money back.   oh.... Half-Life 2?  SWEET.
