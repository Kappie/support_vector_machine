Not because of the line-up, I was rather expecting some of the bandsto be crap, but because the bands I did want to see weren't on top form ( urlLink 3ho'stwomexicansandatinofspanners ), or they didn't get a good crowd reaction ( urlLink The New Grand Smoking Palace ).    Still I got to eat some dirty festival food. It was probably worth a tenner.            This is a picture of the crowd on the way up mount ashton :-)        This is a mentalist     Later,     Tim
