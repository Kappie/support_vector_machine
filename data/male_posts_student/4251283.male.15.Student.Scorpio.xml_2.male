Oh well, I decided I'd better go make myself a blog to see first hand what their all about...Oh yeah, and even more importantly, to test one man's theory that Gmail invites are sent to people with Blogger accounts. There, now I dont have to feel bad about  using  the system; if I receive a Gmail invite, I earned it by writting this entry.      Well, I'm impressed. This whole Blogger interface is really really nice (even in Firefox running under Linux, now thats saying something). Everything is just really smooth.      Hmm...I dont have anything else to say. Maybe, if I post again, I will introduce myself a bit.  *This is not spell checked. The button was broken.*
