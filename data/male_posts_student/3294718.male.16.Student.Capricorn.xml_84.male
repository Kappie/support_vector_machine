If Proctor ever gets kicked out of that territory, he is in for a long ride on the Emo Express.  So, let me tell you a little about the place I work. I will use today as an example. In the morning, it was Lewis, Josh, Nancy, and myself. Now, Lewis does nothing. Everyone thinks he does work, but if you watch carefully, he actually does nothing all day. Then Josh; Josh hides in the drive-through. Sometimes, he adventures out to cut up some boxes or maybe fold towels but not to much else. Nancy is usually busy doing something like counting boxes of ice cream or doing the paper work that Sandy should be doing but isn't because Sam-Sam has an ear infection. Sometimes, we also get to work with Bailey who just demands stuff and does nothing. Sometimes we can get her to do all the shitty jobs though. Now, later on today, the stalker came in. Stephany is perhaps the creepiest person that works at the Dairison. She will relentlessly follow you around and try to talk to you even though you have made it clear you think she is a dumbass. Also, Megan came in today. Megan ends up standing with her arms crossed and doing nothing most of the time. While some people may say it is because she started yesterday, I say it is because she is retarded. I know if I did that on my second day I would have had Andy or Lewis harassing me. No matter who works there though, I am happy. This is because Nick is gone and Nick was equivalent to Satan. A Satan that didn't do anything.  Back to John Kerry. No matter what anyone says, he is a BIG HUGANTIC step up from Bush. PERIOD. And Jason, your theory of two new candidates in 4 years makes no sense to me. So, you would rather have two new people run for President in 2008 (even though this isn't guaranteed) than have the Chief of Dumbasses kicked out after four horrible (and unearned) years of Presidentialtude?
