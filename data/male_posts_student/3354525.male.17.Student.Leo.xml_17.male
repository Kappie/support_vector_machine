I'll start with Prom weekend.  Quite simply, it was a blast. I got to talk to a lot of old friends that I don't see much of at school, and it was great to see everyone all dressed up. The day after prom, I drove up to Wasaga Beach with a few friends and spent the night. There was about 70 or 80 people from our high school in total. Party on. I found myself watching the hockey game at some guy's truck across the campground. He had brought a TV and hooked it up to his truck, so that we wouldn't miss a minute of NHL action. The whole weekend was one of the best of my life.  So now all of my ISU's are over, and I can actually settle down and start to think about my last summer with my friends. It's very upsetting, as I have known many of the people I go to school with for 13 years. THIRTEEN YEARS. And now I may never see them again. The more I think about it, the less I look forward to college. But at least I will leave high school with some amazing friends, wicked memories, and a diploma.  I'm leaving for Europe on June 20th, and I'll be gone for 12 days. Kurt will be maintaining the site in my absence, and I trust he'll do a good job. *ahem* Expect pictures and stories when I return.  On a more serious note, June 28th is election day. I encourage everyone who is able to vote to do so. By voting you are voicing your opinion, and choosing the way you want your country to be run. Remember: you can't complain about the way the government is doing things if you couldn't even be bothered to vote. So please, take the time to research the various parties, and make your vote count.  Until next time.
