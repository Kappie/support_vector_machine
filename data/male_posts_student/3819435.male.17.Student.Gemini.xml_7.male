Here, on this Web-Log, I shall recount the significant events of my day (perhaps in Third Person). Also, in my writing, I will capitalize random words. Do not try to comprehend the reason. There is none to comprehend. I will try my Damndest to update everyday (but s*** happens, ya know?). Okay, once again: Welcome to the Dugan Domain. Farewell!
