(chen has been through this type of trauma before, as his wife was once run over by what chen claims were kmt goons, paralyzing her from the waist down.) the same day, the kmt actually offered a reward greater than that of the government's to find information about the shooter(s), who fired while fireworks were being set off. now that chen has won reelection, however, many of lien's supporters feel that "a-bian"'s followers, or "greens," were somehow behind this attack, because obviously it's worth risking being murdered by a publicity stunt to boost reelection prospects. now, because of this incident, "chen activated a national security protocol, meaning 200,000 military and police -- traditionally nationalist supporters -- could not vote."  random bric-a-brac:   [+] deja vu? again, in the second round of the  urlLink ncaa tournament ...stanford  urlLink lost . just like the  urlLink a's . *TeaR* [+] mark cuban has a  urlLink blog ! he sounds smart; he talks about things like the "bounty" he set on bruce bowen for smacking around michael finley. it's ok though, the  urlLink mavs  suck. [+] britain might  urlLink keep its athletes out  of this summer's  urlLink athens olympics  thanks to the  urlLink 3/11 madrid bombings . wow.  [[happy belated birthday belinda]]
