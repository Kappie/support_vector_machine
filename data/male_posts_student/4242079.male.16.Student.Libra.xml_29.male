He should also know that the good friend of his that fixed the problem had no malicious intent and knows he's cool enough not to get mad at her for helping out. Not that he would ever do that. And if he did he should be reminded he did in fact tell her his password once and that she has never used it against him, being the sweetheart she is.  Ciao dude. Visit me!!  -M.
