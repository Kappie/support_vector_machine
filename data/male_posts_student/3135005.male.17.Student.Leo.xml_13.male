I was talking to my friends, all of them, and found out sonething that i couldn't bring up and realize on my own.... It's the fact about all these girl situations ive bin in. I usually have no problem approaching a girl and doin my thing but for some reason a have a problem with that here. I approach the girl here, yah that hasn't changed. I talk to the girl and get to know her, that hasn't changed. I get her number and we talk alot and she gets real comfortable with me, yah that hasn't changed. But that is where the truck stops. I never seem to go to the next level, the next step. It's like my subconcious is preventing me from doing what i do. I haven't had a girlfriend since i left edmonton, which is  2 YEARS dammit!  Like fuck! 2 years? and the thing was i couldn't figure it out. and when these girls see im not gonna push it any further they leave. i would leave to if she just cut it there. yah we are still friends but thats it, and thats not right! Its even so bad that when i was gonna attempt at this one girl, i didn't even make it! I didn't even get the chance to try. And usually id just ignore what that obsticle said and try anyways but for some reason i just let it go.  But i figured it out. It's because I don't want any attachments... I don't want anything that may attach me to houston. I dont want any reason to consider staying here. I wanna go back home to edmonton and have nothing holding me back. That is why, that is why i get so far with the girl but i dont seal the deal. I take it to the point that my conciousness automatically stops me. Well holla at yall later
