  Now we got W2AU oping hardcore down at Pappa Johnny Two Tango (PJ2HQ).
  
   
  
  Nothing like associating with the rich and learning how to work it -- that's what life is about. Our own Colin, KU5B gives a big blah to the affair, the rest of us just wonder how the drinks and the yls were.. 
  
  Go gettem AU, we'll see you when you're within 4 yeras of drinking age at Dayton.
