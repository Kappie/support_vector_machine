With that in mind, my review of the Bizkit boys doing "Behind Blue Eyes" by the Who.  Well, the fucked it up in ways unimageninable.  They used Speak 'n' Spell this time.  The voice says "Discover" and then someone cleverly spells out "Limp Bizkit."  Originally, I thought that they were going to go all mash mash nu metal with the song, but never got to the more rocking section of the song.  Fred, you sheer lack of tallent, and ability to make me cringe at rock classics is second only to P. Diddy and the rape number he pulled on "Kashmir."  Good job.
