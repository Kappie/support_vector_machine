So I was going through them tonight, and I have to say: The GVHS class of 2005 has to be the ugliest group of motherfuckers in the world. There's seriously not one attractive person in the class, male or female (unless you have bizarre tastes/fetishes).... it's insane  I'm going to go light my pants on fire now...
