"I'm at the movies, but nothing is playing. I'm outta here"  A nice pretty girl came up to me and interrupted. "Just give me fifteen minutes!" She wore jeans and a T-shirt, with dark black hair and white skin. She ran into the bathroom, so I took a seat on an old counter that was in the middle of the lobby. This part of the theater hadn't been used in years, and they had never bothered taking out the old counter, so the kids started sitting on it when hanging out. Right now I was the only person using it.   She came out of the bathroom and came and took a seat next to me on the counter. She sat next to me. She wasn't wearing a tshirt after all, but rather a while button shirt, unbuttoned just enough to show the perfect amount of cleavage. She started the conversation.  "So what do ya do? You make a lot of money?"  "Well, actually I don't make any money." I wasn't making any money at that point in my life. "I actually just graduated. It's only been a week and I haven't yet found a job".  "Oh that's cool. I think that we should turn this into a little date. I came here to catch that new Tom Hanks movie, but it doesn't start for about 45 minutes. Let's hang out and get to know each other a little better, and you can come with me to catch the movie. Even though you probably don't really want to see the new Tom Hanks flick."   The Hanks movie was a romantic comedy, so I wasn't allowed to see the movie without a girl. Male protocol. I could kill two birds with one stone here. I was stoked. So we sat around and talked a little bit. That's when he showed up. He was tall, with blond hair, and a relatively unattractive guy. He also had braces. But he physically just came up and ran into her.  "Oh, I'm sorry" said he with a filthy french accent. Like all girls who are female, she saw passed all of the ugliness and the fact that the kid was a complete retard, and fell for the accent that always turns em on. I was in for a battle. He offered her a massage. And of course she went for it. Now what the hell do I do?  The massage stopped as I started talking. I told old frenchie that I too had been to France. Instead of punching him, I decided to take that approach instead. It seemed to work as she walked away from him and came back to me, showing some interest. In fact, as I pretended to be civil with the frenchie, I asked him about his favorite part of America.  "Ze ??????? down South." He replied.  I didn't know what the ??????? was. The girl refreshed my memory. "The ?????? is the underground railroad network of tunnels down south." My mind flooded with memories of the long complex underground tunnels that were now a grand tourist attraction. As I thought about that, our french friend gave up and left us alone. The ushers opened the doors to one of the theaters. The music from the credits filled up the lobby. "Let's dance" she said.  I of course was a little apprehensive, but she was all about the dancing. So we started to dance. The girl felt very comfortable in my arms, just a very warm feeling as waltzed around the snack counter, which was in the middle of the lobby. All of a sudden I had a growling dog at my leg. "Charlie let go of him?" The girl shouted.  Charlie turned out to be her dog. She decided to take him out to tie him up. That's when I saw her. Janelle, she was sitting on one of the benches along the wall, blended in with the rest of the crowd. She was looking at me and gave me one of those "I see what you are up to" looks.    I had to see how I was doing in my situation, and it had to be quick before the girl came back. "Janelle, how long have you been sitting there?"  "Long enough to see what you are getting into. Who's the girl?"  "You wouldn't believe it! I was about to leave when she asked me to stay here with her and catch a flick."  "Huh. See Jason, aren't girls cool?"  "Yeah. Anyways, you gotta help me out. Things are going good but I really want to make this work. This girl is really cool and pretty and everything else, and I don't want to fuck it up like I do any other attempt."  Of course she had some advice. "Listen Jason, I've been watching ya, and you seem to be doing things right. But you really ought to talk about her more, give her some compiments, and not some fake compiment that she'll see through. She'll know you're just trying to get into her pants. Give her a real compliment. And let it be true and original, not just the average "You have pretty eyes" routine. Don't be afraid, have fun, and make her feel like a woman."  I realized that I had talked a lot about myself in the conversation. The girl came back in. She had no idea that I had a coach sitting 5 yards away. Compliment Jason, you have to think of a compliment. But I didn't really need to think of anything. It came naturally, because I meant it.   "You know, I really love that outfit you put together for yourself. That white shirt, the way it fits on you and how you wear it, the jeans that fit perfectly and show your hourglass figure. The way that your black hair seems to flow right with the outfit. You're really attractive with a nice touch of class added on. But how did you get so cool and smart too?"  She smiled and took my hand. "The movie is starting. We can talk about it afterwards. If we have time for talking". She gave me sexy smile and a wink and took my hand, and we walked through the door. Before the door closed I looked back at Janelle. She gave me the thumbs up, and I gave her the "You the man" point. It was going to be a fine evening.
