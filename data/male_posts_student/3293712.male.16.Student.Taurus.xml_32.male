I  think it will be worse seeing some freak on the corner with a green kilt.  I hope you wont work that corner with Ramsdale.    Mattson, why would you bother getting a CD player in your car when you treat it like shit and it probably wont last that much longer where you should drop the cash for it now.  The best part of my day was when I heard "psuedo- punk" and then shillist's gambling addiction was settled by T. Nelson.  When it took a long time to figure out how to use this site.  Dont bother asking me.  I wont laugh.
