(on that note tomorrow I need to go to the post office. post....post....post....)  Too Much Work? Overstressed? Need a day off? Take a page out of bobert's blog. Of course I have my mother to back me up when I want to stay home. But I always have a honest and valid excuse. Monday? I was tired, I felt shitty, I had egg the night before and got ill! So I have a reason (however minute). I checked the internet time and time again and there is no thourough manual or guide on how to steal a day off from school. First, determine the type of parent you have.   The Types ---------------------  1.) The fussy gussy: When you say you're sick, they worry. They want to check your temperature, keep you warm (or cool, depending), and tend on you hand and foot. If this describes your parents, see Section 1.  2.) The pouty doubty: You say you're sick, eh? Prove it! Does that sound like your parent(s)? If it does, see Section 2.  3.) The easy breezy: If you need some time off, your parent(s) understand. Just have a good reason. See Section 3.  4.) The too-busy-to-care: Often mistaken for Pouty and Easy. They don't want you to stay home, but don't have the time to check. What ever will you do? See Appendix 1.  SECTION ONE, THE FUSSY GUSSY -------------------------------------------------  You are stuck with the MOST DIFFICULT parent to fool. If you say "don't worry, i'll be able to fend for myself" they may read that "I'm faking it, send me to school mommy! (or daddy or grammy or whatever). Find a way to boost that temperature. If they have to be distracted for a while, find a heat source (hot water tap should work nicely) and boost that temperature to around 102-104째F (if you have a Farenheit thermometre) or if you are a truly metric Canadian (GO METRIC) 38.89-40째C. Why did you need to go to the bathroom? Diahreaah? Felt like vomitting? You decide. Don't go above 104째F (or 40째C) otherwise your fussy gussy might race you to the hospital, and while you may of wasted some time, you'll be serving longer in GROUNDING because you will have been exposed. Now that you have the fever, refuse to let them touch you. A fussy gussy usually can tell by the forehead. Periodically throughout the day suddenly RUSH to the bathroom like there's no tomorrow. Retch (force vomit if you feel fussy gussy is getting wise to you. Force vomit by playing with your gag reflex with your finger or an object (toothbrush, etc...). Or go with the trust standby, diarheaa. Pour some water with ice cubes in the toilet for a nice PLOPPING runny sound. Yeah, its disgusting to see written, but if you want optimal effect......But don't do a vomit run more than 3-4 times, and always drink fluids after each run, otherwise fussy gussy will be worried about dehydration. Diahreaah can be 6-8+ if needed, but space them out so that fussy gussy really gets to worry. REFUSE the hospital. Say it was a bit o'bad pork, or ham, or bad alfalfa, whatever. If that doesn't work, just say that you are starting to feel better. Lame excuse, but what else have you got?  SECTION TWO: THE POUTY DOUBTY -----------------------------------------  Ms (or Mr) Pouty isn't AS hard to fool as a fussy. But you still need effort. Usually pouty's are people who have to work during the day, so you have pressure few minutes to convince them. You have to pull the tricks that fussy has to do, but in a shorter time. But once they are gone, you've got free range of the house and don't have to act all day. If a sitter or someone is there to watch you, follow fussy gussy guidelines loosly. ANY phone calls you recieve, speak hoarsly and pained, for it might be Parent/Guardian checking up, or the school to ask where you are (if parent forgot to phone).  SECTION THREE: THE EASY BREEZY (not beautiful cover girl lol) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  YOU'VE GOT IT MADE IN THE SHADE PAL! Just make up an excuse. See Appendix 2 for Easy Breezy and Other Excuses. At first easy might be doubty, just give a little fussy gussy evidence and your're on your way!  APPENDIX ONE: THE DON'T HAVE TIME TO CARE ---------------------------------------------------------  Well, you have a tough thing ahead of you. Treat as if a Fussy Gussy Pouty Doubty.  APPENDIX TWO: EXCUSES ----------------------------------------  This is my favourite list of excuses. Try them!  1. I am really tired. I tried so long to memorize for the /INSERT EVENT HERE\ that I wore myself out. 2. The always loved FAKE SICK 3. I ate some bad /ENTER FOOD HERE4. 24 hour flu! 5. If you are adventurous (or its Thursday, wanna have 5 day weekend) 48 Hour Flu. 6. You caught something at SCHOOL (and don't want to recirculate it, better stay home and fight it :) 7. I am having a real problem with some people at school, I need a day to set my affairs in order. 8. I need a day away from the noise and hussle-bussle of school to recap on my thoughts and I get SO much more work done at home.  Well, thats about it. If you have ammendments, excuses, or otherwise, please feel free to comment. There is a Comments (0) thing at the bottom. Please fill it up!  With Love,  Bobert
