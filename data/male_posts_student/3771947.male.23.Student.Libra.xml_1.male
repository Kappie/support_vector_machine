In the morning I worked for the Army, it was a pretty boring day all around. I did not even go out.  Friday: Today I worked for the Army in the morning. I drove a Hummer to get an oil change. I made sure to stop at my father's house and give my brother a ride too. I went into my father's office and billed out water bills for some of his units. It is allot of math and if I ever get ambitious I could do an excel worksheet to simplify everything. I talked to Patricia, she is the best secretary ever! My father is lucky to have found her. I hit the tanning bed on the way home and put a "fore sale" sign on the house. Not much new. Ii think I need to stay in this weekend and finish the house; showings start Monday.
