You know...I really got to give some fair warning before I dissapear like that. Otherwise the people who do read this (mainly digital crickets I think, but hey...you never know) would think I'm just irresponsible and lazy. And I wouldn't want that now do I?  On a related note. I got back the results for my three project modules. The big surprise is not the good grades that I got for the first two, but the fact that I didn't fail the last one as I had expected. Frankly speaking I would have failed myself if I was doing the grading, but failling that module might have derailed my entry into the final year of my degree for as much as 9 months. Now that I have scrapped through on a passing grade, there should be no delay.  I am totally grateful for this unexpected blessing...best of all its just all the more reason to celebrate!
