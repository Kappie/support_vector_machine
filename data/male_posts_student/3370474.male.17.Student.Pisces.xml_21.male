I have ceased all contact with her, and it will take alot for me to ever speak to her again.     I am tired of being second to her.   "Why did you leave, where did you go, and leave me here with all this pain and animosity"     I'm sorry I had a fucking mental breakdown. How would you feel if people disrespected you and spat on you any chance they got?   Its not everyday that I get to sit down and chat. But now I am. And unless someone lets me in, helps me, I might send all this madness upon society.   Im holding my breath.   Sitting with death.   He listens, he always listens.   And I swear, when I blow my brains out, everyones going to hear me now.     Why do I keep breathing? I look ahead, trying to figure out why I am aloud to carry on.   Death please take me, you listen to me, please dont close your arms to me. I need you. Embrace me.... Take me.... Release me of all this pain....     "I Can't remember her face"  "No onecan take her place"
