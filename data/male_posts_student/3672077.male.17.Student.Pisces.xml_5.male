We decided to see the truly hillarious, Anchorman, and man was that movie soo funny! Sometimes we just don't realize how such small things could be so funny! The advertisements may seem a little on the lame side but I guarantee that everyone would get a huge laugh out of it. Some of it is cruel humour but man, it could really make you laugh!   Hopefully I can get a chance to go clubbing this week while freedom still runs free. I wish I could go to some club downtown or maybe even that big place across in Gino town. Very big club and some amazing Eurodance and Hi-NRG music. Well hopefully I can find the time to write in more entries and keep this crazy blog updated and current. Later!
