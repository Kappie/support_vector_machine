People are thinking i'm a poet of some sort and an extremely emotional person; well i'm not and would never like to be. I don't beleive that life is just a poetry and that we humans sway to the tunes of the rhymes. Well i think life is a battle to be won; That probably explains my ambitions to become the 'DICTATOR OF THE WORLD'. Human race should read and talk about me until it becomes extinct. My great great great great grandson should study history from books which have my photograph on the cover page. I'm starting to learn to shut my emotions, because you have to develop a HEART OF LEAD in order to win in the battle of life. Of what use is the life which passes-by unnoticed by the world in which your death is only mourned by your family and which is just 'another death' in the wide world?. That's why I want my death to be something which is discussed for generations to come and is mourned by every sane person in the world as the death of THE GREAT INDIAN WHO RULED THE WORLD.
