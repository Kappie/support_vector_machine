It was a good movie but the greatest thinsg that teh movie has accomplished in me is raise my interest in Bob Dylan and made me search the net for the lyrics of  urlLink The Revolution Will Not Be Televised . It was so impressive that I put a spin on it and put in in the description of my blog. Another Denzel Washington movie that made me want to scour the net for a song's lyrics was Fallen which made me want to search the lyrics for  urlLink Sympathy for the Devil  by Rolling Stones. Its funny how you dont start to notice something unless it either stares you in the face like The Revolution.. does during the fight sequence or like Sympathy.. which plays when the final credits are being read out.
