I guess I'm just simply not used to dealing with stress. My workload this quarter is unbelievable compared to the past. It's a bit scary to think that this is what graduate school is like. Reading entire books non-stop. Writing all the time. It's no wonder it's tough to be a grad student. How do you make enough money to surivive when you're working your butt off? And if you're working, will you have much of a life? I guess that's why I see so many of my TAs in the pub!  I guess I'll find out about grad school in the next few weeks. Right now I'm wishing I applied to more East coast schools. I feel like I need a change of scenary and an escape from some of the things here in So. Cal. that make life more frustrating than they need to be. If I were to not get into any graduate schools... I would need to find a way to getaway from Irvine. I know I'm not the only one. I've heard the same from Remy and Naomi.   Well anyway. I've got a lot of stuff up on my page now. If you're actually seeing this, feel free to browse.  **
