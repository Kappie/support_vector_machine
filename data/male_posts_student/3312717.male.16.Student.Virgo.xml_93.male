I had 36 new emails, and I just couldn't deal with it. So I deleted it all. So if you sent me something relevant, please go ahead and send it again.  The Chris I usually refer to is Chris Oseland, my best friend/mortal enemy.  I've been a Clash fan for a while, but not a hardcore fan until about six months ago. My uncle gave me a copy of  Combat Rock  three years ago, and I've dug that for a while, and I have a bunch of assorted Clash songs on my computer. Now I've been buying all the CDs I don't own and Joe's work with the Mescaleros.   I like it when bands mix genres, man. All my favorite bands do (did) it, be it Bad Religion mixing hardcore with melodious folk-punk, Operation Ivy mixing ska and punk, or the Clash and Sublime mixing ska and reggae and punk. Great bands try new things, and you can forgive the occasional misstep (BR's  Into the Unknown  is an example).  I bought these aviator shades at the flea market the other day, and I love them. I wear them everywhere, including at night and inside. The aviators are  magical , and I don't even care that they make me look like G.G. Allin.   Since we are on the topic, lets talk about fashion. In case you haven't heard, I started a fashion revolution. I am quite the dresser, from my shades to my shoes, which make people turn away in awe when I walk down the street. Being the revolutionary  fashionista  that I am, people try to rip off my look and leech off my incurable sense of style. Those people (who will remain unmentioned) should go throw themselves off a tall cliff.  I can't even remember what I was going to blog about tonight. My thoughts wander everywhere tonight, and even typing is a chore.  We (we being myself, Houley, Hobe, and John) went to the late show tonight. John, as he is apt to do, bailed on us. Hobe knew the cashier so we got free passes to  The Day After Tomorrow . After arguing for a while we decided to go to  The Stepford Wives , which blew my mind with it's implausability. One of my pet peeves are glaring plot holes in movies, and  TSW  had plenty. I didn't even understand the ending, but the movie entertained the hell out of me. But isn't that why we go to movies? To laugh at someone being electrocuted from kissing a robot head?  Today me and the Oselands went to Best Buy, to browse their facist shelves for new music. We settled on Wesley Willis. In case you haven't heard, Wesley Willis is the  goddamn man . I can't even explain how weird/awesome it is. But anyway, Best Buy didn't have any Wesley Willis CDs. So we went on their website, which plays music pretty loudly through the Best Buy music section's speakers, and blasted  Chronic Schizophrenia . That was the highlight of my day, hearing the Daddy of Rock and Roll being blasted in all his crazy glory. Then we were told to turn it down, and Erik turned on  Fuck You  and we ran out. Ah, to be a hooligan again.   I was looking for my Pokemon game today, but I think I threw it a while ago after I realized that the Japanese stole countless hours of my precious childhood.  What is it with the pressure put on us to join in on the latest fad? I don't want to be told what is cool by corporations. I want to decide for myself. The Man is always keeping me down by telling me that I haven't started a revolution, that I haven't lit a fire in the collective hearts of the youth by wearing cut-off pajamas and checkered shoes. Fuck off, man. I'm not going to wear Hollister or Abercrombie and Fitch or whatever is "cool" and can be found in our local mall. I'm going to keep wearing my Erik-made zip-up and band shirts. I am going to overthrow your hateful mall clothes.   On the subject of clothes, I bought a shirt that proclaims that "Emo Sucks." A bold statement, I know, and I hope that it offends every emo fan I meet, including Hobe and the stalkers. Emo is like pop-indie. No, that is not a fair statement. Never mind.   Is it wrong for me to believe I am awesome? I come across as a jerk, but that is probably just because I am one. If you believe you rock with all your heart, you rock. If you can remove all that self-doubt from yourself, you will be a lot better off. Don't be afraid of looking stupid or coming across as a jerk. All you have to believe is that you can do  anything , and you will. Yeah! Self-Empowerment!  John finally burned me the mix I asked for. I admit it was partially my fault. Here is the tracklisting, along with commentary: 1. Bad Religion- "I want to conquer the world" Quite simply the greatest song ever written. It rocks, rolls, has wicked solos, and has a important meaning. 2. The Clash- "Hateful" Not my favorite Clash song, but it fits well within the mix. 3. Minor Threat- "Filler" The part at the beginning, when Ian McKaye yells, "What happened to you? You're not the same," gets me everytime. 4. Mustard Plug- "Box" Ska! 5. Nirvana- "About a Girl" Back when Kurt Cobain made honest music, Nirvana was actually quite a good band. They never get the hype where they deserve it. I won't call Nirvana revolutionary or anything, because they just mixed punk and the Pixies together and applied it to corporate rock. You can hear Kurt at his best on  Unplugged , because you can feel the emotion in the songs. 6. TSOL- "Code Blue" Well, everyone hates this song, even though it rocks. Necrophelia is a great idea to put to a punk song. 7. AFI- "Morningstar" I couldn't remember the name of the AFI song I  really  wanted, so I picked this one. Before Davey Havok wrote the MTV-friendly  Sing the Sorrow , he wrote music that sounded new everytime you heard it. Plus, this is a great song. 8. Weezer- "Only in Dreams" The greatest emo song ever written. 9. Operation Ivy- "Bad Town" Often imitated but never replaced, Op was the quissential ska-punk band that came in the wake of the Clash. This song always makes me think of Brainerd. 10. Dropkick Murphys- "Far Away Coast" I dig DKM's acoustic stuff. When the scum is rubbed off Barr's voice, it really shines. 11. Atom and his Package- "Punk Rock Academy" This is how I feel about high school.  12. Bad Religion- "Sorrow" BR's songs are always complex and deal with subjects deeper than girls, and this is another of my favorites. 13. Dead Kennedys- "Nazi Punks Fuck Off" When I saw Jello say, "What are you rebelling against?" in the  In God We Trust, Inc  DVD, it summed up how I feel about the pop-punks at my school. 14. Bouncing Souls- "Manthem" A tribute to all the fun I have with the Oselands. 15. The Doors- "Hello, I Love You" I hate aimless acid-rock, but the Doors have always appealed to me. Plus, this is a good summer song. 16. U.S. Bombs- "Jaks" When me and the Oselands head out the door, sometimes I get this feeling that we are going to destroy everything, tear down all the normal power and social structures. This song evokes the same feeling in me. 17. Jack Johnson- "Sublime/Bob Marley Medley" I regret not putting any Sublime songs on this, but I will on my next one. This is a cool medley.  18. Lamb Effect- "Homeless Man" I don't know how you can't dance to this song. 19. Adam Sandler- "Ode to my Car" Listen to the song. 20. Bob Marley and the Wailers- "Redemption Song" I love Bob Marley, and this is my favorite Wailers song. One reason I bought  Streetcore  is because Joe Strummer covers "Redemption Song" on it. 21. The Hives- "Die, All Right" I don't really like the Hives, but I  do  like anti-capitalist rants, and this is one of the finest. 22. The God Awfuls- "Disconnected Youth" Kind of boils down punk into a nutshell. A funny song, but it still rocks. 23. Bad Religion- "Walk Away" The last of no less than three BR songs on this comp. Just as "I wanna conquer the world" was a good beginning, this is a good ending.  Until tomorrow, I'm a fist-pumping anarchist blight on society.
