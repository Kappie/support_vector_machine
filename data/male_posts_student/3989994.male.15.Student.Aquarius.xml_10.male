I thought it was not graded so i did not lift a finger in completing it...oops wrong word, it's not complete and she passed me blooming miracle. She gave me a rather high score for language and failed me terribly on content... not much was there? did not even come close to grazing the word quota. Ok so it was my fault for doing a terrible job! she was shocked when she read my piece i'm sure. Just love doing that!   Talking about english i had my english paper today. It was horrifyingly tough! The comprehension passage was bloody difficult, the questions down right absurd, the answer, what answer! aghhh i left it all blank! nah... the section on the meaning was revolting i knew like one out five..i mean waht is periphy? or something like that. The summary was a total disaster...i was not quite sure what they required you to do, and my answer seamed so repetive and had no consistent flow... You get my drift? IT SUCKED!  Ok enough whining, by now you would most likely thing i am some whinger or something... Tuesday thats morrow, i've got to stay back after school for extra math...sense something wrong? and after that i have got to stay a little more for a session with the rest of the debate team to prepare for the upcoming debate. I'm the fourth speaker...yeah i am good...(head swells...and nose grows longer). Ok the topic is "mother tongue should not be an examinable subject" and we're preposition...this is like a blessing since i have never passed my mother tongue by more than 5 marks before... Today i had a free period, ironically it was mother tongue, so i started on our points for the debate, me and madhu...we did not get far, it suddenly dawned on me how hard the topic is.   But alas all things must go wrong for me, afterall that is how the world is, so as i would have it the debate which is going to be held on the 29th a thursday happens to clash with my interview for the presidential candidates, and given a choice we all know which one a person would choose but unfortunately my dictator of a teacher insists that the debate is more important! AGHHHH how thick can a person get?  Just wondering, do you by any chance know what they do at the brittish council? why are there suddenly so many signing up? The only brittish thingy i know would be the brittish high commision...don't laugh  You know you love me...(a little overbearing but hey...it's my blog)
