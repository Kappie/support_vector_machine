I am skimming  urlLink Haaretz  and watching what is happening in Israel: the final phases of trapping the Palestinians in Bantustans and yet I cannot manage to delve into the articles and analyze the material like I normally would.   I would like to think I have worked everything out in my head and heart, but things keep popping up--images and memories and feelings which I cannot throw out like a deck of cards. The truth is I am not a political machine like I thought I was. I am flesh and blood with a beating heart that also loves and longs for company--I am human. As silly as it sounds, in my younger days I thought I could transcend those petty mortal qualities but I cannot. I am also learning that it is not a crime to be human either--that I am allowed to relax and unwind even though I am constantly tormented by the injustices I see in this world.  I had my first day of work in a week. I am working in Hamtramck, which is this city composed of Yemeni, Polish, Bangladeshi, and African American folks. I went to the training site which was near the American Axle Plant and it was a reminder how urban children are robbed of many things that suburbanites take for granted. Watching the kids play in the concrete jungle with a pollution spewing factory is a reminder of the failures of this society and capitalism in general. Here are my thoughts from sometime ago. Although the article was originally written for the South End, it has ended up on a Columbia server:  urlLink My students will not sing the National Anthem.   And how could I not mention, being a Detroiter and all that the Pistons are playing for the NBA Championship tonight. What I get a kick out of is seeing all these folks talk about the love for Detroit yet most of them could care less about the population or do even less to help the people in the city. It is true that sports have turned many black athletes into sheer zoo animals. As long as they perform they are accepted. Of course if they dare to speak their mind on social or economic issues they would be bad entertainers.   I am curious to see what happens tonight. I hope there is no rioting because Detroit is not a city that needs it, unless of course people take their rioting to the yuppie neighborhoods of Troy, Canton, Bloomfield Hills etc. I could support that and partake in it as well. However I do not see that happening and nor do I see the rioting having any other face than mostly a mad drunken stupor. I am sorry to disappoint my radical friends, but it will probably not turn into an anti-war or anti-capitalist riot no matter how much I or other radicals want it to.   Besides this romanticization with riots is not good politics. Rioting I think is the expression of the disorganized. When people have not been organized and they reach a certain boiling point they riot. They have no clear voice other than random acts of violence. I do think militant action has its time and place, but it would certainly not look like rioting. In the end, I hope tonight is a peaceful night where people can escape from the terrible problems that lingering in Detroit.  Hopefully tonight I will catch a bit of the game and stare at the stars as well--that would be a good night!
