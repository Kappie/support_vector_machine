And I realize the bigger picture here, That it all goes back to some point where I misunderstood his personality. Misunderstanding leads to fear, fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and of course hate leads to my inevitable suffering. This theory and all subjects surrounding it can be found in the studies of ninjitsu and the art of the Warrior. Maybe soon I'll understand him and maybe I'll grow to like him. This seems hard to achieve due to my last encounter. I ran into Jason and Rob on the train the other day. Not sure what they were doing coming from Hoboken but They asked what I was doing. I told them that I had just come from the city from PWF and they both asked what I was doing in Hoboken. I explained that I took the path here and was now going home from Hoboken. They wondered why I didn't just take the midtown direct. I explained that my route was cheaper plus I could use my dad's Hoboken pass so all I had to pay for was was the path. Rob gave me one of those, oh I get it looks but Jason...He gave a look that should have come with "Why is Greg so stupid?" He shook his head and walked in the next train car. He has to be likeable in some way. Meredith sees something in him obviously. She likes him enough to go out with him and Rob 's his best friend so he has to have some qualities that are truly likeable. We'll see in the long run.
