I've been gradually working my way thorugh the first series of 24, while watching the third series on Sky One. Talking of Sky One, it's getting pretty decent, some of the programs anyway. 24 is excellent, so is Cold Case and a new show called Las Vegas also looks interesting. Shame about it having adverts though.  Over the last two days we've had some Polish students of my age come over to spend the morning with us, with each of us taking round a pupil of theirs. I got a girl called Magda who spoke pretty good English and thankfully asked quite a few questions. The worst thing would be to have someone who didn't talk at all. At the end of a little Flash presentation they showed us about their school, their senior teacher mentioned that we would be going back in September. Thanks for mentioning it beforehand! Ha. Would be pretty cool to go back though, thinking about it.  Oh, and 24 has just ended on another brilliant cliffhanger. Another whole week to find out what happens next!
