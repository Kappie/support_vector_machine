I'm still kinda busy so i'm cutting my history short.. hmm a strange and confusing thing happened.. i found out that  dilys  actually told   Amy  and terissa  that i was sad for the past few days because i was rejected by  diyana .. and these Fu*king lies could only have come from  diyana  herself.. wats up wif making those tales.. God, i didnt offend them in any way.. wats their motive.. i'm still wondering.. btw i just have to say it..  Amy    is the one i like n beginning to love her for who she is..even if she doesnt.. and i was utterly shocked that dilys told her that.. wats up.. are they trying to ruin my hope of getting her.. even if so.. wats their purpose.. dont tell me  diyana  likes me.. thats impossible.. i'm too low for her.. she got lots of other suitors.. but whatever it is.. Glad that whoever knows about it does not believe it and never will.. including  Amy..  thank God.. so now i got to warn those two gals.. whatever motive they have in mind, they better forget it before its too late.. i will not take lies lightly especially if its about me.. i've not shown my wrath and i dont want them to be the ones to see it first.. and to all of you out there.. just forget about all evil thoughts u have in mind.. if it have something to do against me.. Trouble is near.. i can be friendly but u won't wanna mess with a  satanic deadknight .. and if you do anything to  Amy .. Hell will break lose. so get down to your own business and leave me alone to lead my life in peace..  Coz Until the day i die, i'll spill my heart for her ... So  F**k off or be F**k ... Peace..   *sory for explicit and violent content*
