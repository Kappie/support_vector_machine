I told them we would charge them rent if that made them feel more comfortable and respectable. ;)  Patti and I will pack up her room at her parents house on this upcoming weekend and then have all of her stuff (bedroom and storage) moved in by the end of the month. It will take a few trips, even with the Jeep, truck, and rented trailer, but it will finally be done. Hopefully, the housewarming party will happen by the end of August. We've already come up with a cool contest idea for the party (not sharing it with you yet) and our wish list for the house is enormous.  Patti and I have been putting a lot of time and effort into the landscaping of the house and preparing it for some of our ideas. She's done an incredible job working over a lot of the land and cleaning things up. We estimate that we can start our cactus garden in 2 - 3 weeks and we are looking at ways of removing the tons of lava rock all over the property. I've been on bug detail for a couple of months and go around smelling like pesticide. Everytime someone spots an ant anywhere outside, I'm called in with the sprayer to be John Goodman. Its fun and chemically educational!  Other than that fun stuff, my parents things get packed up on Wednesday and shipped out on Thursday. They'll be staying in a hotel until the 21st and then they board a plane for Buffalo. On the 16th, they'll be returning to the house to help do a lot of the cleaning (since all the furniture will be gone). Oddly, the house will be nearly devoid of furniture for over a week since we're not moving Patti's stuff until the weekend of the 23rd. I called most of the utilities today and taken the necessary steps to have the accounts put into my name. But it looks like we'll save a nice chunk of change if we switch to SBC for phone service and get their DSL service. I'll tackle that tomorrow.
