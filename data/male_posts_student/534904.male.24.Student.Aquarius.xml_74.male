So sending your lover a rose is like saying "my love for you is transitory and based solely on your appearance" - but a potato! Potatos last for fucking ever, man. In fact, not only will they not rot, they actually grow shit even if you just leave them in the sack! That part alone makes it a good symbol.  But there's more!  There are so many ways to enjoy a potato! you can even make a battery with it! That's like saying "I have many ways in which I show my love for you" Potatos may be ugly, but they're still awesome, so that's like saying "it doesn't matter at all what you look like, I'll still love you"
