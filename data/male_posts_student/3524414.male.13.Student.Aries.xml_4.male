What luck we got,there was an old man,gues maybe around his 50's siting 2 tables frm us.After abt a few mins,he started to laugh to him self ''HAHAHA HEHEHEHEHEHE''.We were all shocked,thinking "WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WIF THAT OLD HAG?!" His expressions were kinda weird doh.Frm the side view it was as doh he was crying,but no tears,frm the front view,it looked as doh he was lufin his ass out @ sumtin.. We thought abt that man for awile,and thought to ourselves..Hmm.."Singapore retrench rate are getting higher",so we presumed that that poor old man had been retrenched..there were also evidence to our sayings,he was carying a black bag which looked like 1 that a biznes man use 2 cary..  TO PITY OR TO LAUGH? U DECIDE.
