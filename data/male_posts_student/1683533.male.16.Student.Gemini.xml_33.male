I played guitar on the porch today...actually hoping somebody would hear...Lyndsy said that would be so cute to see me playin guitar on my porch....lol...I'm gonna start doin' it more often now...maybe i'll get lucky, and a nice girl that passes by will think its cute as well...  I desire romance...dammit....I want it now...I don't mean just the sex and shit.....i mean romance...... love ....I feel so alone.......it hurts like a bitch....wanna get this band started not only to make and love my own music and play shows...but maybe pick up a nice punk chick along the way....I got a weak spot for punk chicks...lol....  I whittled a stick today with my pocket knife...i was  bored ...my sis says that the southern people are probably very proud of me.....  I got to go....tired...need sleep..school tomorrow....adios..... go and kiss my pillow......i am so pathetic lol...   "textbook hippy man." -Ben Folds
