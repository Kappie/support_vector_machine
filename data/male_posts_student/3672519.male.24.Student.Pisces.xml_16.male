I toasted the moment in characteristic style by photographing the fireworks from the perch of my favourite drinks haunt, NUSS suntec, and as expected, this was the only presentable shot I could salvage from a dozen fuzzy sparkles.  Ever searching, albeit self-consciously, for the multitudinal symbolisms of life's moments,I think the above sums up my general place in my nation's fabric. The cloth definately aint red. Like a dazzling, half-blurred burst of white I find myself filling the sky, unintentionally propelled into the present from the embers of my parents, my forefathers, who have painstakingly scaled, then eventually consumed, the distant, dark treetops of history. And in a moment I will be gone. What would change on the 40th, the 100th birthday?    urlLink
