I don't know...I was thinking again. You know what happens when I think....  Anyways, every year my family goes away for five days on a "camping" trip. I usually don't look forward to them because they are family outings...together. But for some reason I'm thinking that it will be good to get away from everything for five days. No computer, no telephone, no people....it'll be nice. I might even leave my cell phone behind. I don't know. You may not know that my family camping is in a 31' travel trailer. heh. We don't believe in camping, we need a fridge, microwave, television, and all those goodies. But last year I got so much done during that trip. I got my entire AP history book read and my entire AP english book read. I got a lot done. This year I'm looking forward to it because I want to catch up on stuff and get away from people for a few days too. I want to get my entire ap government book re-read (cause I forgot what it was about....yikes.) And I want to get through my entire SAT study book which I'm only like 20% done with....It'll be exciting. But seriously, I'll get a lot done and hopefully it'll be sunny too cause I need to get tan. Last year I got really tan. Yeah, so I'm looking forward to it....for the first time. I leave on Monday. But since I got up at noon today, I should probably start doing something productive.  Till Later.
