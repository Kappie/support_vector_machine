Now that you've made it clear, I think it's safe to assume you're obsessed with InuYasha. 4. You'll be familiar with my characters as we go along. 5. I'm glad you like my posts! 6. Lighten up with the edited profanity, please.  Anyaways, Yesterday I went to Kiss Concert 2004. I missed Frickin'' A (DANGGIT!). Avril Lavigne, Maroon 5, and Ja Rule (whom restored my faith in Hip-Hop) are officially some of the coolest bands/singers out there. My mind was "somewhat" pure before JC Chasez came out (let's just say I think he's turning Japanese). We heard at least 2 songs  by Jessica Simpson before we left (I could see her mouth from where I was sitting, and I was sitting pretty darn far away). And all the while, I was sitting in the smoking section (lungs... burning...). It was a pretty good concert. -Sane Intolerant-
