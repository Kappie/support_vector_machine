I just finished "Law School Confidential," which bills itself "a complete guide to the law school experience."  I'm a little disturbed that it talks about how doing some studying before law school starts -- taking a course or buying some law-related tutoring software -- can be helpful.  Because with two weeks left, I'm just about out of time, and I don't know the difference between  collateral estoppel  and  concilium plebis .    (I did buy a dictionary, and those are in fact two terms I have randomly selected to use because they sound complicated and have lots of syllables.  And, even though I opened the dictionary to find them, I did not look at the definitions, so it is not an exaggeration in the least for me to say I do not know the difference between them.)
