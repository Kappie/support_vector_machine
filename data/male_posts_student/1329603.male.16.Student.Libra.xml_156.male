Tomorrow, something may happen that will change the course of not only my life. Tomorrow, I might get my act together and not be a completely cowardly... person. Tomorrow, my situation since August of 2003 may change. Tomorrow, I may lose not only one friend. Tomorrow, I may be happy or sad. Tomorrow, I may decide to do nothing. Tomorrow, I might ask a question I've asked only twice before. To be honest, I'm terrified. And, to be honest, I don't know if I can do it.  Love, Jon Roskilly
