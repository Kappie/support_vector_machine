I still can dream That one day love will fall out from the sky  Do you still remember all the time that has gone by? (do you believe?) Do you still believe that love can fall out from the sky? If from where you're standing, you can see the sky above I'll be waiting for you, if you still believe in love (do you still believe?)  Find a way to bring back yesterday Find a way to love I hope we stay When tomorrow becomes today Love will find a way  I'll be waiting for you, in my heart you are the one If I cannot find you, I will look up to the sun (do you believe, do you believe?) If from where you're standing, you can see the sky above I'll be waiting for you, if you still believe in love  Do you believe? Do you believe?  Do you still remember all the time that has gone by? Do you still believe that love can fall out from the sky? If from where you're standing, you can see the sky above (do you believe?) I'll be waiting for you, if you still believe in love  Do you believe?
