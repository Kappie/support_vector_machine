I mean, there was this satisfaction of getting into a slot one company but at the same time, I was very clear that among the slot one companies, GE was not rated very highly. And one could always say that who gives a shit about batch perception and stuff as long as you are happy, but then an MBA is basically an ego trip, wherein you are just as good as your performance in the last important event on campus whether it was the summer placement or the PPO or the term results. In this regard, it did hurt me a bit that I hadn’t got through a better company in terms of brand value on campuses.  However, the summers experience was an eye opener in more ways than one. Not only did the summers give me a lot of perspective about the kind of jobs that exist in the corporate world, it also elevated GE to a much higher status in my eyes and I’m not saying this just because I’m supposed to defend the company where I go for summers.  GE has this extremely open culture where you are allowed to create for yourself your own comfortable shell and work independently. We were given good, independent, live projects which were not just garb as most projects in other companies were. These projects were very much related to the business and most were business researches being undertaken to look at emerging markets or the gaps in the existing markets. Most importantly, we were not expected to be secretaries to our guides and put in their thoughts into the project but were expected to bring in our own fresh perspectives. The timings were flexible and we were allowed to work whenever we wanted to and the way we wanted to, as long as we had something to show to our guides at each review. For the two months that we were there, GE treated us with the respect that is due to people integral to the organization. We could go and contact anyone and everyone in the organization for our projects and more importantly, everyone was helpful and encouraging.  The company culture was open and we talked on a first name basis with everyone in the organization. All this added up to a tremendously comfortable work environment which absorbed us in very quickly. And of course, how can one forget the perks of being in GE! Oh Boy!! The lunch was something each and every summer intern at Corporate Park would look forward to each morning. It was absolutely ‘Awesome, dude, Awesome!’ (This is how Ron would put it everyday). We were also allowed free access to cold drinks, coffee and biscuits all through the day. The Girls in GE were all pretty, which added to the entire ‘feel good’ thing at GE. And the bottom-line is – The MONEY was good! GE definitely keeps its people happy!   Most of our project guides were extremely busy with their own work. But even in their busy schedules, they did find time for us. Both my guides, Amitabh and Rajesh were extremely helpful. Not only did they help out in my projects, they also tried at their own level to make me comfortable in the organization. While Amitabh pushed me harder towards a comprehensive analysis of the project and gave me ample opportunities to make mistakes and correct them, Rajesh made sure I never made them at all – he actually went out of his way to make me comfortable with the idea of mystery shopping for the competitive benchmarking part, which could have become a very contentious issue – Rajesh made sure that I had the VPs backing for this part. Rajesh would also sometimes ask me about how things were going and whether I was facing any problems related to the project or even unrelated to the project. My guides played a big role in my doing well in my projects and having a good stint at GE.  All in all, the two months at GE went off very well. Getting the PPO was very very satisfying. I truly believe that there were some amongst the 27 summer trainees who were better than me in a lot of respects. Some of these did not get PPOs for the sole reason that they had an off day during the Assessment Centre. The PPO does not prove anything. It is, like so many other important things in life, dependent a lot on luck. However, it is one of those little rewards of life that makes you feel happy and confident about yourself.
