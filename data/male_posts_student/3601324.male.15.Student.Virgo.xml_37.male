She just didn't have the sockets I needed! The neat Audio and Video ones! And in BED. Ohhh, in BED. There was never any ACTION in bed. You know, because there was no remote control! I couldn't even bring her out in public. She looked... outdated. She had that whole 90's look going on. So yesterday, girl! Things just weren't working out. The age difference was just... unbearable. So I did it. I left her for another wom- er, TV. I'll admit, I feel alot happier now with Durabrand 13" Color Television, but I can't help but feel guilty when I see little little 90's-Television-That-I-Don't-Have-The-Box-For-And-Thus-Can't-Tell-You-Its-Name staring back at me when I'm walking along. We'll both get over it, I'm sure. We had alot of good times, sure, but there's something special between me and Durabrand. Oh yes. I could just feel it when I watched a DVD with her. It was... magical. I think she enjoyed it as much as I did.  *rereads entry* ...I feel dirty. :P
