When I was awake and playing Runescape, I was running through the wilderness, until I could get to a point where I could use my Teleport spell, since the wilderness blocks Teleports up to level 20, and then I guess I spaced out. I was then inside a weird dungeon. I attempted to pull out a weapon, but my sword had disappeared. A strange flowing black thing wooshed over to me, and tapped me on the head. It told me, "you will not live to see your next..." then the radio snapped me out of it. I don't know what to think about this. Oh well, at least Hydra22's ok.
