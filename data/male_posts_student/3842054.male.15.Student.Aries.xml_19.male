I need to get in a car, and drive away, and go to North Palm, and go to the beach, and be with my friends, and go to Dreyfoos. I NEED TO GET OUT OF BOYNTON. THe only reason i still want to live here is katie. But, i cant complain, I have a pretty good life.  So, i slept in today. YEAH. Had some cheerios for breakfast, and nobodys cares, but i shall tell you and you shall like it. Crash Bandicoot must be the best video game ever. Not only have i beating it  like 20 times, but i can play the first level with my eyes closed. Well, i can play any level with my eyes closed, BUT I CAN WIN IT WITH MY EYES CLOSED. I need a job so badly. I need to make money. I need a lot of things... So, I continued to beat brittney in bandicoot. Then i went to light some matches,a nd my mom came home and bitched at me for not cleaning the house. Im going to dreyfoos tommorow for some meeting, but my date got canceled cuz im not gonna be there lnong enought to do anything with Emily. So, here i sit waiting to go driving, which i probalby wont.  Its cloudy out. Dont you hate clouds? I only like them in the morning, but they piss me off in teh afternoon. Night clouds piss me off too. They depress me and there is no need for them except to blcok the moon from all of us to see.   Im gonna post later cuz i have no life.
