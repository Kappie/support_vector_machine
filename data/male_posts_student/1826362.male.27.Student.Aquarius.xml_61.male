Do literary critics have any relevancy outside of the classroom?  If I am in a position of claiming that a book has literary merit, that it's an important book, say The Sound and the Fury, and that some other book, say, Harry Potter, just isn't in the same league, how is that relevant to the millions of people who  love  HP?  How can I reconcile a judgment that a piece of work has no literary merit with the fact that it is read and enjoyed by a lot of people?  (and, just for the record, I really really like HP, and I think that there is something like literary merit there, despite what Harold Bloom sez, I'm just using it as an example)  The work in literary theory over the last 50 years or so has had the advantage that it made people who interpret texts relevant to the worlds in general (I'm thinking of things like feminism, cultural studies, deconstruction, marxism).  If you think , like I do, that they got something fundamentally wrong, where does that leave you?  Would i rather be right, or relevant?
