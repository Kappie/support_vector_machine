I really like the fact that this story is told from a bunch of different perspectives and all interconnects.   Basically, the story is about a boxer who doesn't take a dive when he's supposed to so contract killers are sent after him, along with other numurous events I don't feel like mentioning. They're all good though, so go check this one out for sure.     Rating:  4/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M
