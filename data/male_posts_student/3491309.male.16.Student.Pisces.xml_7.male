Why, this is so bad, I'm not likely to come off as nonpartisan, dangit. :D  Seriously, this is bad.  Our President is using the hallowed halls of our churches for political ends (and I needn't remind you that politics isn't exactly Godlike).  Furthermore, this jeaporadizes SBC's tax-exempt status.  OK, that just all flew past you, didn't it?  Not to fear; I shall clarify.  This is dirty politics.  The Bush-Cheney campaign, in a memo, has attempted to obtain church directories from the Southern Baptist Convention, for campaign purposes.  It comes down to unsolicited political advertising.  Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission put it best:  "The bottom line is, when a church does it, it's nonpartisan and appropriate.  When a campaign does it, it's partisan and inappropriate."  The memo included a number of things for congregations to do, including:  1)  Send your church directory to your state Bush-Cheney '04 headquarters or give to a BCO4 field representative;  2)  Identify another conservative church in your community who we can organize for Bush;  3)  Recruit 5 people in your church to help with the voter registration project;  4)  Talk to your pastor about holding a citizenship Sunday and voter registration drive.  Perhaps the worst part to all of this is the tax-exempt status.  Churches typically fall under the IRS catagory of 501(c)(3).  501(c)(3)s are nonprofit organizations that do charitable things.  The Red Cross is a 501(c)(3).  Goodwill Corp. is a 501(c)(3).  Now, some individuals dispute Goodwill's 501(c)(3) status because it invests money into the stock market...which generates profit.  Goodwill walks a fine line.  In the same way, if churches get involved with political activies.  Actively being involved in the political arena like this is grounds for churches to lose this special status, crippling charitable organizations as we know them.  That must not happen, but the Bush-Cheney campaign conviniently overlooks this for (what is that?) political gain.  In summation, the Bush campaign's actions concerning voter registrations have been unethical and jeaporadize communal welfare in are country, welfare that is greatly supplemented by church donations which wouldn't be possible without the tax-exempt status.  To indulge my partisan side, a vote for Bush is a vote against ethics and all welfare as we know it.  Please, feel free to comment on this entry here.  All legitimate feedback is appreciated.
