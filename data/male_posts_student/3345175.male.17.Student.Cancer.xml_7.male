I've replied to Maz's letter. Seems no matter what i write about i always end up complaining in letters, and then i feel like a right arse coz i start putting myself down. Not good. Big mess. Messier than Daniel with naked pics of Orli.   Anywayz, the name is concerning my latest attempt at script writing. The basics (and the not so basics):  Title: "Boing!"  The story concerns a group of teenagers who live together for the duration of a theatrical course. Based on my own experiences at SYT, it follows the relationships developed during the course.  Billy being pretty much the main character, his relationship with Danny is the most developed. The two of them meet, are shoved into a romantic relationship that everyone pretends is the best thing to ever happen. Unfortunately, although there is a sexual link between the two boys, they dont really "mesh". Danny only seems to be going out with Billy because he's there, he's single, and he's willing, while Billy has a lot to learn about dealing with relationships (especially with people as sensitive and quiet as Danny).  Other relationships include that between Kate and her boyfriend David (who is never seen), Emma and Guy (who falls for her after they drunkenly sleep together one night), friendships between Arlene and Claire, Billy and Vanessa, Vanessa and Maria and Emma and Ali. Full of stupid characters, but they just have to be in there.  Following from the end of the second week of the course (out of five), we see the group getting ready to go out for Billy's 16th birthday. Unfortunately the electricity in the dorms blows, forcing the whole place onto really weak backing power - No one is allowed to leave the building. Instead, the kids bring the party to them, sitting in the almost dark, drinking, dancing, singing, getting into strange situations with Italian boys who are sharing the dorms.  Aint it just my life all over? :P  Anywayz, following this night there are a load of relationships started up, and the whole thing carries on from there.  The whole idea behind the play is the theme of our handling of imperfections. Like with Billy i've had to put a lot of energy into writing, partly because i've had to criticise Danny fairly and reasonably, while at the same time bring out his insecurities regarding his own faults.   This theme is also where the title comes in:  In the game of Woosh, which the group play as a concentration exercise, certain commands can only be used under certain circumstances. "Boing!" is one such command. The point is that Billy is on the whole a relatively patient person, but Arlene's constant use of "boing!" in the wrong context silently drives him nuts - it is her innattentive nature (her imperfection) which sets off Billy's impatience (his imperfection).  And thats about it. Not a lot left to explain. Should have it finished soon, but i do have a life to live you know!     ....alala....
