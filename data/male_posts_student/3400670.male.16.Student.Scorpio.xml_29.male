America was trying so hard to beat Russia in the "space race," and I didn't realize it was that important to a lot of people. I also liked how it showed how much people liked the Kennedy's. I think it was Guss's wife who got totally emotional because she didn't get to meet Jackie.  I have to agree with Ms. Clark that astronauts are totally hott after seeing this movie.  I enjoyed my first extra credit movie night. Thanks! Xoxo,  Jess Knab
