And suprisingly i actually had fun i forgot how much i actually like it there compared to timbercreek its bling  blinging!  Anyway i thought i would just throw that out there.  Especially since my last post was like 6 days ago.  Ok so this might not make a lot of sense seems i am a little wasted.   But hey who can't beat the dollar drafts of labatts at upfront that was key.  Ok but thats all i want to say and i want to give  a shout out to all my homeys at the JABA the House.  Ok bye.
