     
      and i am quite tierd cos i spent most of the weekend journeying back and forth from where wewere staying. My grandad is recovering well from the operation he had so that is good. I spoke to my uncle and they invited me to go over and spend the rest of the holidays with my cousins. im considering this and going to work with a architect, so i shouldnt be bored for the rest of the holiday. Well that is about it for this update. Except that i am looking for a sewing machine so i can get to work on my camp blanket. Nighty Night
