It was totally fab, and i got a new Hoodie out of the deal, thanks Brian, whoever you are:) It's sunny today and i am very pleased about that. Hopefully it will help lift me out of the doldrums i've been in recently. was a little surprised by how much i could drink last night without getting totally butt ass drunk, but i guess i have been building up a tolerance recently. Nothing really new going on.
