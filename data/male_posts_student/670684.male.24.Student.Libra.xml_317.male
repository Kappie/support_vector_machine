I made them on Thursday, and if you question it, contact Denton Heaney.  I'm good at picking games as long as the Chargers aren't in the thick of a playoff run.     Note:  the spread is indicated by the parenthetical numbers.  For example, for the line WASHINGTON, that means that I picked Washington to win, and gave the Jets three points...because the game was 16-13, that will go down as a tie.  Where I picked HOUSTON (+14), that means I get 14 points.  Even if Houston loses, as long as they don't lose by more than 14 points, I win.   WASHINGTON (-3) BUFFALO (-1) JACKSONVILLE (+4) DENVER (-6) INDIANAPOLIS (+1) DETROIT (-4) MINNESOTA (+5) SAN DIEGO (+6) HOUSTON (+14) NY GIANTS (-1) PITTSBURGH (-5) DALLAS (-2) SAN FRANCISCO (-7) NEW ORLEANS (+3) TENNESSEE (-3) PHILADELPHIA (-3)  I'll post these earlier in the week from now on.  If you want to play, send me your picks and I'll post 'em here...don't think there's enough space in BackBlog for posts, but try if you want.
