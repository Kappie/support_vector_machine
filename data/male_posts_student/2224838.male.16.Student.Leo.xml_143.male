The series between the Flames and the Lightning has been great so far, and there is no telling what will happen in this game. I expect at least an overtime or two. You never know who will be a hero in a game like this one, but you can be sure that guys like Jarome Iginla, Martin Gelinas, Brad Richards, Martin St. Louis, and Vincent Lecavalier will be great. And of course, Miikka Kiprusoff and Nikolai Khabibulin will be tough to score on, as they have been for the entire series.  Althought I have been pulling for the Flames to win a cup for Canada (although I'm from the US), a win for the Lightning would be just as good. Anyway, the puck drops in about fifteen minutes, so be sure to watch. I'll be back for an update after the game.   UPDATE:   urlLink Fedotenko scores both Tampa goals   Alright, that game sucked. Until the third period, that is. I was all geared up for a great game, win or lose for the Flames, and I got crap. I wasn't upset because the Lightning were winning, but simply because the Flames didn't seem to be playing. Finally, when the third period rolled around the Flames got with it and scored one from the blueline! But it didn't matter I guess, as the Lightning went on to win it. Anyway, I'm happy for guys like Andreychuk who are winning their first Cup after such a long career, and for the young guys like Richards, Lecavalier, St. Louis, and Fedotenko. Also, I guess I should be happy that a team in the US won. Hopefully everyone watched the game, even though it sucked most of the time.
