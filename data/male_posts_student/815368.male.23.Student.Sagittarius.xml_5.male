Afterwards we stopped at a local car wash to wash my car.  My car was in need of a wash BIG TIME.  Now all I need to do is fix the transmission and air conditioning and it will be good as new.  I also forgot to mention a new paint job. lol Anyway, TGIF.  Today happens to be payday.  Too bad I have to work  but at least I'll have time to practice my violin.
