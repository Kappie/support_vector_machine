'Cos my head just aches... when I think of.. the things I shouldn't have done.  But life is for living, we all know -- and I don't wanna live it alone."  It looks like I'm not going to get much sleep tonight.  I was told by my geometry teacher that these assignments would take no longer than 20 minutes.  This one ended up taking me an hour -- and I skipped some problems halfway through because I didn't know what to do.  If you know me, you know I'm a lot smarter than that.  I don't suppose it's my fault.  She only lectures us for about 10 minutes of the class then rushes to write out all the notes so we can do as much of the assignment as possible.  So really we get most of the hour to listen to her ramble every 7 minutes about how when we grow up, having a masters degree in math like her is going to help us get any job we want.. just like she could, but she loves teaching.  I hope she's not reading this right now.  And suppose she is, what would she do?  Nothing I hope.  All I'm doing is ranting about how I don't like her and her teaching.  I would switch teachers, but you know what?  I don't want to.  There are a couple reasons why.  For starters, I'd like to get my basketball coaches in trouble for telling me to switch.  (Hrm, if they were reading this, what would they do?)  What the hell kind of a thing is it to tell players to switch teachers because of them requiring extra effort on academics?  What the hell is the point of school, damnit?  That really pisses me off, and it makes me sad about the direction the basketball program is going.  If you're saying, 'what direction is it going?' then I would have to say I don't know.  There are a lot of things about it that just.. are.. fishy.  The only thing I have to say is that high school basketball is no longer about fun.  It is no longer about playing for the love of the game.  It's about dedication to the program.  It's about being 20 minutes early for practice -- and having practice 20 minutes before the scheduled time.  It's about having practices on Sunday.  It's about coaches saying 'HAVE FUN' and yelling for a missed reboud.  It's about spending, in my opinion, gobs of time on something that, if you're not Michael Jordan, will have no effect on your life.  Most of what I have said is probably wrong.  I don't care to dispute its validity -- it's my opinion.  It's simply that basketball for me.. is not the same.  I realize how much I've ranted and raved about nothing in particular.  I'm just extremely tired of my schedule.  I need more sleep.  I hope you've had a better week than I have.  Song of the moment: "See You Soon" by Coldplay  Good night.
