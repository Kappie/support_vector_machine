There was this drunken redneck looking guy with a cowboy hat and leather jacket at the Belmar last night. As trashy as he looked he was kind of funny to talk to. He was talking about how we don't own the land and we are really its caretakers. Then he talked about all the stuff he's learned from a 4 ft kung fu master, and Native Americans. He was barely coherent, but he was hilarious. I seem to communicate well drunks well.  Oh yea... Melanie kept complaining that the place reeked of vomit. I told her that's a sign of a good bar.  ***
