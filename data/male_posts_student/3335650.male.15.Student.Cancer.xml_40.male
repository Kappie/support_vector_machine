Not a bad deal for me then!  Still, if anyone sees a townie (cough, spit) with a cap on (i know, they all wear them) on a rusty blue bike (stolen, they all are) then tell me where and when and I'll give them... a little visit :-P And if anyone sees a P800 with imei 350443-10-337043-1 please, please tell me! Today school sucked a bit more than usual, everyone seems to be in a piss with me for no reason, and I have no idea why... usually when people are pissed off with me, they have a good reason, but this time i really don't have any idea what I've done. Actually it's not everyone, but it's still annoying... actually it's only four people... oh well, I guess there's more fish in the sea. Just a shame it's the people who are most popular. Oh well, I guess I always have Lou =o) Talking of Lou, haven't seen you in ages on here! Ok, I saw you at school, but it's not quite the same =o]  I mentioned my teacher saw this page... luckily he took a humorous approach to my actions and I didn't get into trouble, and luckily it *wasn't* my singing teacher! There was one message which was time-stamped in lesson time and I don't know if he was convinced by my explanation of being able to change them when you post a new message. You can, right? 'Cos I saw a setting  in post message: advanced, where you can change the time and even set it to auto-publish at a given time. I love Blogger!  Anyway, I'm off to do something now, not sure what, but I've run out of things to type =op Look after yourselves! LoZ
