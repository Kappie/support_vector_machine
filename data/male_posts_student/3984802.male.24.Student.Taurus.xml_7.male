We just kind of sat around and pigged out on junk food and then played a few rounds of catch phrase. Guess what I did tonight though? I finally submitted my AMCAS application for medical schools. Whoa. I'm really doing it. Really it is just the beginning of a very long process, but it is a big step in the right direction. I was pretty happy to get it submitted. A little less happy about the $520 that is cost to click the "submit" button. What can you do though?  I had a really fun weekend this past weekend. Friday night was okay. I had two receptions to go to. They were both from 7-9 and one was in Payson while the other was downtown Salt Lake. I managed to get to both of them. The one in Payson was my shelver friend April's. Cousin Tausha was the one in Salt Lake. That one was quite fancy. It was held on the top floor of the Wells Fargo building. 23rd floor. Very nice view of the city and the sunset. They had three chocolate fountains. That's right, three. As if one or even two wasn't enough. Two were brown chocolate and the third was white chocolate. Then on each end they had these big ice sculpture things that looked kind of like the fountains except they were ice and they put the fruit for dipping on the levels of the ice sculptures. It was nice. Cousin Tristan played his bass guitar while his teacher played on the grand piano. They sounded good.  Anyway, on to Saturday. I had another reception on Saturday (yes, that makes a grand total of 5 receptions from one Saturday to the next). But afterwards Ross and I went with Emily and Beth to the movies. We were planning on seeing Napoleon Dynamite, but it was sold out so we decided to see The Village instead. Very good choice. I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it was a great story. It was just scary enough, but not like I was going to pee my pants or anything. It is quite suspenseful though. But besides enjoying the movie, I really enjoyed my company. This Beth girl is someone that I have kind of been a little interested in for a little while now. She's cute and fun and is pretty mature, in spite of only being 19. She is probably more mature than I am in a lot of regards. So I really enjoyed spending time with her that night. She was fun. We laughed a lot and that felt so good. I haven't had so much fun in a long time.  Sunday I went to church and it was good. After church Ross and I went over to Emily's apartment for dinner. Among other people, Beth was there. Dinner was good. After dinner we played a game of nerts or nertz... I have no idea how to spell it. Pretty fun game. Then we went to sing at the retirement home, as we usually do on Sundays. I love visiting there; those ladies are so much fun to visit with. I think Emily, Beth and I are actually going to go back on Friday night and play games with some of them. To keep a short story from becoming long, I spent the rest of the day with Emily and Beth. We played another game of nerts and then went to ward prayer and then a whole bunch of people joined us for a big game of nerts. Beth and I were a team all night and, once again, I had a good time with her. She's a fun girl. When Emily took me home at midnight she questioned me, of course and I, of course, questioned her in return. Emily said she had fun on Saturday night too, so that's a good sign.  I am not ashamed to admit that I am pretty scared to even think about the possibility of getting into another relationship. I guess I've just felt my share of hurt and have kind of been trying to avoid any more of it. I have kind of distanced myself from girls this summer and so it is kind of weird to be thinking about it again. I realize, though, that I have to be willing to give it another shot. It might end up good, it might end up bad... who knows? But I can't just give up on girls; I have to keep trying. I will say, though, that I have no intention of rushing into anything here. Of course, I don't have a ton of time left in Provo... that doesn't mean I'm going to throw caution to the wind though. We'll just take it easy and see what happens. It seems like I always say this and don't always follow it, but I really think I will this time.  Anyway, I should get to bed. Classes finished today, but I still have my final on Thursday. Yay for finals.
