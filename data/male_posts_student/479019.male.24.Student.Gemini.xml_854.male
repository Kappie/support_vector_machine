I was somewhat amused by  The OC 's self-parody of  The Valley ...  I am somewhat amused by the new BR song, "Los Angeles is Burning" though... They actually quote themselves in the song... sort of like  The OC ... "this is not a test," and "how could hell be any worse?"  But the songs are not where as cool as the ones from  Process of Belief   Today was wasteful due to the copiers not working when I was on campus... it's funny how idleness has eaten up so much of my time recently. However, today I felt energized by the nice weather... Prof. Lee said you could tell that the California boy in me totally enjoying the niceness of weather.  I burned myself a new CD with some tasty new music and walked to campus today...  There was a light breeze, which is nice. Gemini is an air sign afterall... I've always had an affinity for wind. I remember back in elementary school, really enjoying how the wind felt when you faced the eucalyptus trees.   I keep thinking of buying stuff from bikes, Vespas, to skateboards, to rollerblades...   So if I had a bike... would it be weird to ride my bike to a bar, drink, and then ride back home?  ***
