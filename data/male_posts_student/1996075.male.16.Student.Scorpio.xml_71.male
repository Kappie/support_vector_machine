Everytime we say good-bye, Why does it rain, Here in my heart, Everyday that we're apart, Why can't it be, Just you and me, What will it take to make you see...  Like the stars in the sky, You still keep on shining down you're light on me, But out of reach, And I know that in time, You will come back to your senses,  See the signs, And change your mind, I try to look the other way, And keep my heart on hold,  But everytime I'm close to you, I lose my self-control, Why can't I laugh? Why must I cry? Everytime we say good-bye, Why does it rain, Here in my heart,  Everyday that we're apart, Why can't it be, Just you and me, What will it take to make you see, Why can't I laugh? Why must i cry? Give me just one good reason why... Why does it rain Here in my heart, Everyday that we're apart, Why can't it be, Just you and me, What will it take to make you see...  great song, although i know a lot of others would disagree...like christy...and alex...and pretty much everyone...what can i say? i have a unique musical attraction...lol I LOVE YOU SWEETUMS...AND EVERYBODY ELSE TOO! moo ~ lauren
