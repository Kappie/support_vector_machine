Anyway, nothign much happened yesterday. First day of school, it wasn't screwed up. I love school, but only for this span of time.   ~ Finally, I finished the annual report and handed it up with Amanda in Menara TA today. Cheng Han and Arroon were there with us, handing up their club's annual report too. We saw Sekolah Bintang Utara (SBU) Annual Report there too. It was fantastic. The decorations... whoa! Cheng Han kept mentioning Maxwell all the time. He's kinda looking down on them. But who knows, they might give us a surprise. Well, I think we stand a chance to win at least something this year... hopefully. I heard that the Form Four interactors might throw a farewell party for the ourgoing members of the club! Yeah! That means lots of fun and free food. But I still feel  berat hati  to leave the club so fast. And I only need to attend one more ICC meeting only. I might never see the other interactors again. That's kinda sad to me.  We had a fire drill during mathematic lesson today. Ms. Lim tricked us by saying that we can rest starting from 9.30a.m., making us happy for a while. Then all in a sudden, the fire bell alarmed us and we had to go down. Jon said, "why don't this happen during economics?". And when we were down in the field, Ms. Khoo suddenly teased Jon about that. Somebody must have told Ms. Khoo about it... who could it be? Traitor... Lolz!  ~ Out of all the subjects I had today, I liked English the most. Simply because Encik Iskhandar was very sarcastic today. And he was joking a lot today. Other than that, the other lessons were still okay. During history lesson, we talked about many things as usual, such as National Service, politic issues, etc. Mr. Rama is just so informative. He knows everything. What a good teacher!  Nothing else to blog about for today. I'm sure tomorrow will be a brand new day!   "Success is a lousy teacher; it produces smart people who think that they can't lose" ~ Bill Gates
