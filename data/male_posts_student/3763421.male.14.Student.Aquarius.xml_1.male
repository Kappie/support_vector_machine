We went off on a school bus that fits all of us in at 8.30 a.m. The bus has air-conditioners above every seat and even has two small televisions and an installed VCD player XD  While on the way the to PSN, I listened to the songs that I burnt on a disc using my friend's discman. This is the first time I went for a school-organized trip and it's a hell of a lot of fun and a great experience. We reached there at 10.00 a.m. and we were ordered by our tour guides (a girl name Celester and a guy whose name was not mentioned) to be back at the entrance by 11.30.  My group walked to all corners of the place, seeing the displays there about space, technology, plants, animals, etc. At one point, there were two "instruments" that played music from FFX and FFVII! The best part of this trip was this Artificial Intelligence (AI) computer that has a programmed voice and will answer to anything we type on the computer. Of course, we typed in "dirty" questions and she responded something like, "Be polite", "Dream on", "I can't answer your question right now. I'm still learning". "Dirty" questions as in "What's your breast size?', "Will you **** me?", "Can I see you naked?". Of course, I didn't type nearly all of these questions :P  At 11.30, we went back to the entrance and since not everyone was there yet, we went to the convenience store nearby and bought myself a RM2 silver ring that was a bit too big for my fingers (I was in a hurry and did not see if it fits me, since the tour guides are rushing us). After that, we went to the butterfly park and the rabbit park. There were a few rabbits that were just two days old and they looked so small, so weak...  Later, we continued to our main purpose of this journey, to visit FRIM. We reached there at 12.30 p.m. and had our lunch there (rice with spicy chicken and vegetables and a plastic glass of orange juice). A few of my friends threw bones and pieces of chicken meat to the river and we saw a group of fishes rushing towards them and eating them up o_O Yeah, they eat bones too XD  Once we were done, we headed to the museum and were introduced to an old Chinese man that were supposed to be our guide for this trip. After a boring half an hour there listening to his speeches about trees and FRIM, we started our most exciting part of this whole journey, jungle-tracking.  We stopped a few times here and there to look at tall trees and listening to the man's lectures. The journey got harder and harder, and the paths got steeper and steeper. Finaly, we reached a "pondok" and we were told that we had just walked 1 kilometre o_O After resting a few minutes, we were told that the rest of the journey will be tougher since the paths will be getting a lot steeper than before and that those who felt tired on the way must not over-strain themselves. After a few minutes, I reached the destination point (I was one of the fastest, probably the 10th person to reach there while the remaining 30+ people are WAY behind me).  There was another "pondok" here, only that this "pondok" leads to a canopy bridge (bridges that are made out of planks hung mid-air by staircases from one point to another with ropes for one to hold on to and nets to prevent one from falling). We entered the "pondok" one by one, after we were given another lecture (the lecture lasted about 10 minutes and YET the 30+ people were no where to be sighted XD). We entered the "pondok" (guy-girl order).  It has been a long time since I walked on a canopy bridge. Once I reached the checkpoint, another friend and I waited for another friend to reach the checkpoint, letting the girls and guys continue on without us. At this point, I noticed that I lost my silver ring =.= Later, the three of us walked together and we walked on the same plank, causing people below who have finished the canopy bridge journey yelling at us (we were supposed to walk with a distance of three planks between us). The bridge was shaking tremendously and it was funny XD  Once we touched the ground, Celester mentioned to a few of us that no matter how many times a person has walked a canopy bridge, he or she will still feel a slight fear in himself or herself, unless he or she is not afraid of death. Interesting point... Usually, Malaysians never talked about philosophy...  Then, a race struck between my friends and I to reached the ending of this journey. Jumping over rocks, crossing rivers, running down steps, I finally got third place XD  The clouds are getting darker, and it began to rain. We hurried on board the bus and reached back to our school at 4.30 p.m. It was a great journey indeed :D  I took some pics today for you guys to see. It's my FFVII: AC and FFVIII wall-scrolls. They looked a bit blurrish, though.
