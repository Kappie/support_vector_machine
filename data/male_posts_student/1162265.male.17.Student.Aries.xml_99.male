"On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), Selected Works,  Vol. III, pp. 296-97"  This can explain why I'm so nervous now.  I don't have an army.  Or it could be my job orientation is tonight, and I really hope I don't freak out and I'm at a camp with people I know.  I'm pretty sure Lauren is working their, and if we're lucky we can be at the same site so I have a guarenteed ride todos los dias.    I just played Freedom Force for about 4 hours.  Don't you love how I randomly switch topics? This was ofcourse after I read a short Chapter in Count Zero, one of the most hard to follow books ever.  So many characters.....  Signing off. I'll say how the orientation went later.
