We had to make do with another of my mother's memory verses in the car while driving towards Glorietta, where we usually go to have lunch. Heh. So much for salvation.  During the drive, dad said a most peculiar thing. He said he had been busy from the moment I was born, and that he was not able to spend as much time with me as he did with my sisters. What perplexed me was not his statement, for it was most certainly true, but the fact that he realized what he had done. I always thought he figured I was doing all right. My fault I suppose; I was always "the good kid," which is entirely by my own choosing, mind you. Yeah, I've had my walks on the dark side. It's been fun, but much too stressful. Being good can be rather relaxing, actually. Try it sometime.  Dad was never the picture perfect example of what a fatherly figure should be. He doesn't exactly "get" me or my sisters, he's always busy, and he has a second family. He doesn't go home every day of the week, only on Wednesdays and weekends. I see him only on weekends and special occassions. I liked to assume I got along fine, but then I realized the extent of the damage that his absence had done to me. The fact that I crave attention seemed only more natural now; I never knew it, but I had been exposed to deep, deep layers of neglect, which, though not exactly on the extremes, have hurt me in one way or another nonetheless.  He tries. Yes, his attempts are pathetic. I don't care. At least he tries. Sure, nothing can make up for 17 years, but that does not stop him, and that is something that has earned him my respect. How I scorned him when I found out about my half-brother, his mistress, everything. That did not matter anymore. He was my father, and that will not change. He cares for me as he has always cared for me, and I can only do the same for him. ------------------------------ We went grocery shopping right after lunch. It was at this place somewhere near Baclaran. This particular place was not exactly high-end, but it was the type that gave away free samples at each aisle and sold mostly imported products. How ironic that it be surrounded by the houses of people who, in all likelihood, strive diligently just to have one decent meal a day. I dunno, maybe I'm going soft, but I feel like they should just give the leftover samples to those people down the road. Hey, charity work has always been attractive to rich people who like to think they're giving back to the community in some small way (read, so long as it doesn't compromise their lifestyle), so I figure this might even attract more shoppers.  Enough of that. I just wanna talk about food. I got some weird ones today, like mint flavored apple jam, and "strappleberry" flavored juicy fruit (after a few minutes of contemplation, I arrived at a most stunning conclusion--"A! Strawberry saka apple, kaya strappleberry!"). I got some apple filled pastries that I think would go great with some sharp cheddar. I had this craving for tuna sashimi from watching Iron Chef. That Kaga dude was all, "If my memory serves me correctly, the Japanese have a saying on how to properly eat tuna: 'cook it on your tongue.' This means that tuna fat boils at very low temperatures..." and so on and so forth.  Gah. I'm gonna be fat forever. ------------------------------ completely wrong thought of the day: some dude (sd): Oi.  'Wag ka ngang haharang-harang sa daan!  me: Oi.  Sino ka nga pala?  (fyi, kaklase ko siya sa basketball; napaisip muna ako syempre) sd: Anong year mo na?  Mukha kang matanda.  me: First year.  Bobo! PE 2 nga eh!  sd: Ows?  Akala ko repeater ka.  sd again: Ano course mo?  Tingnan natin ang iyong kapalaran...  me: BS Math  'Di ako pumasa ng BAA!!!  sd: A, malapit ka nang maging teacher!  Ampanget ng course mo.  me: Hehehe... Baka mag-shift ako sa BAA next year.  Wala akong kilalang sikat na alumni ng CS!!!  sd: Ano yun, accounting?  Asa ka pa tarantado.  me: Oo... ikaw, ano course mo?  In time I will own your soul and the souls of your kin, and will continue to do so for many generations.  sd: IE.  Mas maganda course ko sayo.  me: A...  'Di ko alam yan, pero eng'g yan siguro. Hem hem... No comment.   No offense sa eng'g/BAA/math peeps. Por komik epeks lang po. Piss awt. ^__^
