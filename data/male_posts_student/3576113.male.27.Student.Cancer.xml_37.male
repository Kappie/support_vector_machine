What could, should, would, I walk away from, given half a chance.  What would follow, the unescapable.  Things dragged along or haunting.  Thoughts of honor by which I try and guide this existence.  Of family both blood and serendipitated.  All the bonds we construct in order to feel safe but what when they are holding back?  Choices, exploration, experimentation, and that fork in the road.  Deferral, delegations, fear, avoidence and that sailing ship.  Loss, failures, the past, and the sunken ship.  Stories, smiles, the senses, nature, fufillment, and that bluebird soaring over the rainbow.  I might never catch it, but I'll try.
