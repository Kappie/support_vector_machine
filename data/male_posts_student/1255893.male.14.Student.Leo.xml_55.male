FUDGECICLES!  )  walked back home to chat w/ the same borin ppl (srry to all of u ppl i talked to earlier, but u tend to get borin when  it's summer and theres nuthin to do .... and ur too gutless to take the bus to some place ur dying to go to when ur parents cant take you )  #3 - finally things brigtened up around 4 pm. i finallly found sth to watch on tv. more fun ppl came online. i had TKD.  the master keeps complimenting me. he might advance me by a few belts b/c im doin so damn good. hehe.   #4 - get back home. find that i have  an over load of messages i hadnt tended to seeing as i wasnt there to respond. however..... the 15 ppl that left messages had left within 5 minutes b/c their so damn impatient. now im here typing this blog. tellin u bout my day. * wat an original ending!* lets see if i can come up with something a little more fun to read tommorow
