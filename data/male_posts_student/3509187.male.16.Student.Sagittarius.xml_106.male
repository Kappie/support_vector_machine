I will admit as crazy as it sounds, sometimes I wish the day was longer... but really what I'm saying is I wish there weren't so many required classes...  Fall - 1. Orchestra/Chem Lab fri 2. Chem 1 - Davis 3. Band/ Study Hall mon, wed, thurs 4. CP English - Horgas 5. Creative Writing - Myers 6. CP US History - Long 7. Adv Precalc - Sutherland 8. Drafting Arch 1 - Klaus  Spring - Same cept: 5. Phys Ed - Mackes/ Lunch fri  If you know anything about any of the teachers, have any classes with me, or anything else that would make me happy, or maybe just not as bored... then TELL ME, won't you please?  WHoo so far I know I have lunch (yes the once a week for only half the year) with 2 people I know... Robin and Steph... Well lets make that one day a week a fun one... See you both ever Friday of the second Half... If I survive...  Yes you read it right... I am in Orchestra and not on Trumpet, On the string bass... Whoo... don't worry I'll play softly until I accually know what I'm doing up there... See you there James and Jenny...  Sad but True (yes thats a Metallica Song): I was going to have Basic Drawing (at the suggestion of Klaus to anyone interesting in architecture), but the day is just too short and correspondence gym would have taken a lot of convincing from me to my parents...  FergFaces... Do you remember Mackes???? I think she was there for 2 years... one of the longer staying gym teacher (another being Mr Ishler).  WEll ok then, until later to all of you all...  -Dan V
