It was the only thing in the fridge, and there's only one, cuz my brother got it for free at a local ball-game. Oh my god, I couldn't figure out what it tasted like. I could say it tasted like total ass or a diaper filled with Indian food, or a combination of the two.   I mean, to start of, this soda has like half the fat, calories, and TASTE! It's like, more healthy. For this reason, when I see the commercial it shows a bunch of young 20 year old kids drinking this shit. WHY THE FUCK ARE YOUNG PEOPLE DRINKING THIS. THEY SHOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT THEIR HEALTH, YET! It's strictly for old-timers, man!   Ugh, I really hope next time I'm desperate for a soda at 12-at-night on a Monday, I choose something better.   ***Word of Advise: DON'T CHOOSE COCA COLA C2, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU CRAVE FOR A SODA!***
