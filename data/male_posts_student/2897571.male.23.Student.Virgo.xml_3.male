Personally, it's a chance for me to follow my favorite team, the Minnesota Twins, who happen to be banged up as all hell right now yet still playing decent enough ball to be a game over .500.  I also happen to play semi-professional ball for the Indianapolis Red Sox which means another season of me hitting .275 with 12 RBI's and no homeruns. Actually, I'm going deep this year. I swear it. Don't believe me? Then bug me about getting a schedule and check out one of our games. Hey, you can't beat free baseball played by decent athletes who actually LOVE the game for reasons other than money. Actually, I can't question the motives of the professional athletes who play Major League Baseball. Hell, who wouldn't accept a multi-million dollar contract to play a game you love?   Anyway, back to the task at hand. The Twins are all fucked up this year. It's still early in the season so players have plenty of time to heal. The biggest question mark right now is their rookie catcher Joe Mauer. Joe is a 20 year old phenom who grew up in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, so he's a hometown boy. He fucked up his knee during the second game of the season while attempting to catch a foul ball. See Joe slid on the Metrodomes rubber warning track surface in an attempt to get to the ball. His shin/knee pads stuck to the rubber surface, caught his knee, and low and behold the guy has some ligament damage they have to repair. It's a good thing he's so young and this happened now rather than later in the season or his career. However, it's still very scary considering he's a catcher and he squats all nine innings.  To add insult to injury, Torii Hunter is on the 15 day DL with a pulled Hamstring, and Doug Meintkeweitz sprained his anke last night. No word on how many games, if any, he'll miss.   Still, the Twinkies are playing good enough to be a game over the .500 mark early in the season. They took a 3-game series from a red hot Detroit team and recently beat an improved Cleveland team. I'm not too worried about the team. This is an organization who have overcome a shitload of controversy in the past three years and they play with confidence despite the obstacles. Take a look at last year's slow start. No worries from this Twins fan, not yet at least.  Tonight I have plans to check out an Indianapolis Indians game and look forward to lots of cheap hotdogs and beer. For those of you not in the know, the Indians are a AAA team here in Indy affiliated with the Brewers (unfortunately). They play in an amazing stadium located in the heart of downtown Indy and the weather today is beautiful. This will be my first time attending an Indians game but not my first time at Victory Field. A few years ago the amateur team that I play on played actually played game at there. But our seats are on the third base side, a few rows up from the field so we are in some serios fould ball territory. I'm quite looking forward to the game.
