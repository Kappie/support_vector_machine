The 61 year-old is wanted in the U.S. for playing a 1992 chess match in violation of international sanctions, but authorities are unsure whether he will be forced back to America. When found, he was quite unkempt, sitting in the airport while bashing his bishop and stroking his horse.   Oh, he was also masturbating violently.
