Also there was this giant mosquito in my room last night that looks like a flying spider. I had to get my mom to kill it because it was hard to find and i was tired. It just just really big. After she killed it, i was just disgusted cause it had long legs and a long snout for sucking blood.  Anyway. Today was just hectic. My mother was annoying because her phones got disconnected and just always getting annoyed. She asked me to ask some friends to call my dads cell phone to tell him to get here and shes yelling at me because i didnt wanna ask twice and calling me an animal. I cant stand how she takes out everything on me.  Also i have a BBQ on friday that im hosting at the house and i still havent gotten a grill or the meat. Currently my moms paying that phone bill and the thing is in a day and a half. Tomorrow i have my tutoring but i was hoping to get the grill today so tomorrow i could get the meat after tutoring. Hopefully this all works out... If it doesnt, then its just going to be one of the many other hopes that ive had that were ruined.  Last but not least im a little angry because my site is still down. The hosting place still hasnt done anything to restore it. I accidently did something wrong attempting to make the loopback and eth0's non-promisc with ifconfig. I fucked up and the box totally crashed and there wasnt really anything i could do remotely. I really shouldnt of done that lol... I hate redhat anyway. Dumb distro. Gentoo and Debian are so much better.
