It just so happened that I chatted with friend of mine the next day and we both decided I should go down and hang out with him in Nashville for a couple days.  So my Spring Break wasn't going to be a total lack of some sort of adventure, after all.  Anyway, he moved to Nashville several months ago and began working with a traveling youth ministry called  urlLink Inlightened Ministries .  I know he runs sound for them and that he handles a lot of their web site and graphics and technical aspect of their ministry, I'm sure he helps out in other ways, too - he's a pretty handy guy - but I haven't learned what else that is, yet.   Anyway, I jaunted down to Nash-Vegas (as Ben calls it... oh by the way, his name is Ben Stewart - he's far right in the photo above), which is a solid four hour drive.  I listened to Butterfly Boucher (whose CD I had bought at the Barenaked Ladies Concert) twice going both ways plus some other CDs of mine.  Anyway, I get down there and we hang out and do some sight-seeing.  Unfortunately if you're not too into Country music, there's not a whole lot of sight-seeing to do.  We ate at a couple of cool places, hung out at a Starbucks for a while, drove around downtown, and just chewed the fat and enjoyed each others company.  Oh, and thanks to him and my best friend Stephanie, I'm totally craving Sushi about 3 or 4 days of the week.    While I was down there we ate at two kind of unconventional buffet restaurants.  The first was a sushi buffet.  We stuffed ourselves SO much.  The buffet only cost us $10, and we had two full plates of sushi each, some clear onion soup, a salad, drinks, and some hibachi chicken.  WHAT A DEAL!  So sushi buffet? Okay, yeah, I can see that... not much different that a Chinese buffet, right? Okay.  So the second buffet, I was a little leary about... it's REALLY not the kind of thing you would really think about going through a buffet line for... MEXICAN.  Like burritos and chimichangas and quesadillas.  It was some of the best Mexican food I've ever eaten.  And like I said, we drove around downtown a little bit, and I grabbed a bite to eat and a T-shirt (and one for a friend) from the Hard Rock Cafe there.  Later the next afternoon, after hanging out and just talking for a while, I hit the road to come home, where I had a meeting to get to and then a bed to attend to.
