I was actually fine until we started playing. And falling in the snow. And killing my legs on ice. My left leg looks like a dog chewed on it. From my ankle to my waist is all scratched up, bloody, and just messed up. But that's what I get for wearing shorts. 2.  Don't give up if you suck at something in the beginning.  Man, when I was just throwing the ball with Neil, I couldn't catch or throw. I mean, I wasn't even that far from him and I couldn't reach. When we started playing though, I got better as the day went on. So listen up kids. Even if you think you suck at something, don't give up because you might actually be good at it. Not saying that I'm good at football, but I can at least catch. Most times. 3.  Don't throw big industrial car batteries without considering consequences. Or without wearing goggles.  Ah yes. One of the better lessons I have learned today. Never try to throw a large battery filled with acid over a fence. You might just go blind from the exploding battery shooting acid in the air, as a certain Neil Ciotola demonstrated for us. Proof of the destructive effects of battery acid is his contact lense, which is deformed now. 4.  Don't bring a football into Boyers Supermarket unless you want to be accused of shoplifting.  All of these things seem to relate to Neil, but anyhow. I never knew a football could be mistaken as a drink. But I guess you have to be keen about what people are sneaking out of your store if you want to work at Boyers. So yeah, don't bring footballs into stores. Because you know it could be mistaken as one of those football-shaped bottles. 5.  Wear a belt unless you enjoy doing bellyflops onto solid ice.  Once again this relates to Neil. So the basic lesson in this ...um...lesson is to wear a belt. He proved that one cannot hold his pants up AND fall on his hands to soften the blow. Of course he chose to hold his pants up because I guess he'd rather keep his pants on than castrate himself. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing for me.   So there you have it. 5 lessons that will change the way I live. I suggest you all read these and take the advice given. Because I don't think anyone wants to have a leg amputated, get falsely arrested for shoplifting, be blinded by battery acid, or get castrated. If you think the above are good ideas, stop reading this and kill yourself. Well, don't kill yourself. I don't want to be responsible for anything. But at least hit yourself.  Listen to H.I.M.
