Ha! Noffke rhymes with off key, there's another Jonah, and the Bishop gets set on fire! There's a giant moon, and the floor is red, like most everything else. It's all red, black and white. Come see the show. Hopefully our publicity manager won't get mad about this.    In other news, Eighteen four-year-olds.  'nuff said. Details in individual posts. You're mother is an aardvark, and your father smells of eldeberries. You can't mix quotes! Okay, don't say that. Jonah caved! He's still in marching band! Now before you get all upset, you should know that I didn't cave until I'd gotten pretty much everything I wanted.  I can miss half of each day of band camp, and all of the June rehearsals.  Also, they really need me back. No they don't, I've heard you play.something. The cat was on the skateboard, but I was unable to launch it. FIN!  Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!
