Went to the gym, worked out, worked on some webpages in the afternoon and made last minute plans for a party tonight.  I got home at 5:10 and Laura arrived soon after.  We did laundry, dropped it off to dry it at UR, picked up Cindy and went to Super Walmart and McDonalds to pick up supplies.  We stopped by the liquor store and bought some tequila.  We came back and I started making guacamole.  Laura started helping, then Cindy started helping.  Luke got here and he started helping making the margaritas.  It made a lot...!  About as much as I had hoped.  Luke stretched it out a bit and it came out perfect.   urlLink    Luke making the drinks.  We drank, listened to music, played SPEED skip bo, which was kinda fun, danced a bit and Luke recorded us.  I just watched the video of us.  Oh my.  Yeah, we'll keep THAT under wraps.   urlLink    My distorted vision for most of the evening.  Cat is tired, I am tired, I'm going to bed.
