When i fell asleep again, whcih was literally afetr i sent a text back to him i had a dream about me and alex being on a bus into Bolton (but twasn't bolton at all :S) so yeah anyway we were at this shopping centre place, so we got a bus just for the fun of it, which said the destination as "Bridgemont" (which is a little village next door to Furness Vale:S Anyways we were on it, then we saw Lucy on it at the end of the journey, when we went through this field with car sales place in it!:S so we all got off, then Lucy said she'd moved to where ever we were because of something to dow tih her old house, that was weird, so then we got back on the bus, then my sister woek me up:@ grrr. Then my final weird dream of the morning was me playing football and being in net!:S so yeah anyway twas muddy and i was diving about the whole place. Then it cut to this advert for Loylds TSB bank loans! (what the fuck?!) so then anyways i shouted "move" at the top of my voice (in my dream) and the dream went to me wandering down the A6 talking to Danny Bulley about how he was going to pizza hut to watch this Italian cup final game, so i said "why don't you just go to t'other Danny's you can watch it for free there" search me how we ended up in pizza hut in the dream but we did, and twas this dodgy TV which we were watching, then i woke up:S What the hell?!
