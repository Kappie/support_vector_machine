If only there was a way for some of you to have a sample of my work...   Oh wait!    Well, guess what! I've managed to find a way to upload some demos so that you guys and girls may download them! Yaay!  So at long last, please check out some of my demos written for various projects. At this time there are only five, but I'll add more as time goes by. A disclaimer, though, is that these songs were all recorded using my keyboard with only my vocals on top (which aren't great); so bear in mind that they are only  demos,  which might contain mistakes, mis-tunes and mis-writings.  Okay, without further ado... please check out  urlLink My Music  for downloads! Also added it to the links in the sidebar. Cheers boys and girls!
