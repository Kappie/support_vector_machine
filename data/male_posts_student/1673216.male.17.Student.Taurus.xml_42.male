But when it comes down to it, you don't realize how much you love a daily task until it changes forever and something different takes its place. It's been a long, long time since this has happened to me. One can forget how it feels, and how to deal with it. It's almost incomprehensible to fathom the next day. 24 hours from now, my life will probably be the exact same. In face, there's probably only a .00000000001% chance that anything will be significantly different. But I've figured it all out! I live for that percent! I live for the impossiblity. I live for that minute fraction. Someday, I will experience it. The change of the winds will eventually come. I can't avoid it, and I don't want to.
