This gorillais to be avoided like a plague, in fact, many scientists believe it to be a plague itself. There is a theory that the gorilla was once a healthy male specimen, but at a very young age he pillaged a USB port and ever since that day it's body hair has weighed twice of it's, considerable, body mass. Since that day it's true name has been warped and twisted through myth and legend to become the name that the creature currently holds, Mullanal. An interesting feat of this gorilla was to create a "website", this terrible waste of English punctuation and grammar can be found at:  urlLink http://www.mullany.tk   urlLink     urlLink
