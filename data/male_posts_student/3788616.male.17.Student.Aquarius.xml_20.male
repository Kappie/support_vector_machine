All that is left is to get back my E8 result than my dream of getting 3 Fs will be fulfilled! Damn it lah! wah lau! do you all really think i am that crazy?! Of course not lah! Shit lah... after this results, i really need to reflect! Argh! so now, i am going to undertake tuition for C Math and well, just simply work harder for the other subjects! i really must not slack already! if not, i am so going to get retained lah! haiz... anyway, i really sympathise with Natasha, she studied so very hard, yet, her results were not really satisfactory, but... i wish her the best and not to lose hope but to strive on... :p  Anyway, i just had a talk with Kelly yesterday lah... and well, i am happy to have things sorted out with her. Indeed the results may not be exactly what i have hoped for, but at least, now i have a clearer picture and know what to and what not to expect. Yup, anyway, to all those that have been bad mouthing me. FIND A LIFE! what the hell, non of you know me lah. Only true relatives and close friends are able to tell others what kind of guy i am. Please lah, and i mean, seriously, if you think you know me now... think again! crap lah... it's cause of people like you that jeopadise situations and cause rifts between people! In future, try to be tactful lah! crap... haiz...  Actually, i have realised that i don't really have clear good friends or close friends, if so... most of them are actually younger than me or are already not in the same college as me. In school, i guys perhaps only Timothy from AA1 knows the inside me better than the rest. Come on lah... Perhaps Yong Xi and Michelle Wong too... but i guess they ust don't see the serious side of me.. that... Chris knows that i can be... of course, i admit to being a huge buaya and flirty guy in the past, but... i believe that i don't do it much now... occasional flirtings definitefly takes place, but... most of the time, they are either done unconsciously or done to like... lighten the mood... my dear Mich mei, wo shi wu gu lah! i really never go and buaya with XH loh! you can stop it mah? aiyo... i tell you the full story that i owe you 1st than you draw conclusions can?  Anyway, back to Kelly, i really don't know leh... i mean... ok... i really like her alot, but... i guess, i may really have to give up all the way lah... yeah... though it's not going to be easy... but... not much can be done to change or improve the situation... thus, even though i have more or less made a decision on who the girl is, this situation with Kelly must be entirely solved 1st... before i can move on... and i guess, from here you realise that it's not Kelly lah... i guess, i have already given up hope in the past, but was never really able to get over it...  Anyway, till than... i have really got to study harder! Argh! And wah lau! That Cheryl or is it Sheryl? from AHB ah! keep on whacking me for no rhyme of reason lah! People were given suspicious stares lah! Than told her to stop, she still don't stop! Haiz... to think i treat her so well... *shakes head* ok... besides than occasional jacking lah! i am innocent! Argh! haha... anyway, it's nice to know new friends better, ie... Cherie, Cheryl (Sheryl), Amy... etc... haha... but hope to get to make more new friends and know my present group of friends better too! haha...  Yup... have i said too much? oh well... haha... ok... i got to go liao! wait people say i crazy again! haha... Anyway, i do hope that things would work out well between Kelly and me... and... of course, the mystery girl lah... yup... but... i guess, i really wished at that point of time that Kelly would get together with me... Alas... it didn't work out that way...so... too bad lah... ok... keep smiling! Live Life To The Fullest! :p
