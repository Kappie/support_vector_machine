I first did that in December of '02, did it again in December of '03 to extend my referral, and now I'm doing it again, most likely (and hopefully) for the last time...  although an 86 degree pool is much nicer to dive in than a 56 degree ocean.  Just not as much cool crap floating around - except for random jimmy hats...j/k.  Ate some lamb coconut curry at Bollywood Cafe across the street on Ventura Blvd.  So now I have to poop.  Later...  "You've all seen the man at the liquor store begging for your change Hair on his face dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange He asked the man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes 'Get a job, you f*@$ing slob' is all he replies."
