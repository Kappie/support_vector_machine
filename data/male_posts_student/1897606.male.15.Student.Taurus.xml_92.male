Everybody want to beat up somebody else who likes someone who likes someone else who doesn't like them back because they don't like the other person's dog...it's just getting ridiculous. Kids, this is your life and it's ending one day at a time. Everything will be okay, I promise, so why do you have to be depressed pussies.   Which brings me to my point: we gots to stick it to da man. If they would legalize weed, everything would be alright for everybody, and I could talk on AIM without getting caught up in these little dramas. While he's at it, the man could go ahead and get rid of alcohol. That shit never did nothing for nobody. Yeah. That's what I'm really trying to say. Fuck alcohol. And you.
