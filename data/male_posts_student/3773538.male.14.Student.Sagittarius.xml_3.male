The 'innovative class' dance members did their dance for the last time. It was so exciting, yet very sad for all of us. The sec 4s had to leave us, and this dance would become history. Almost everyone cried bitterly, including Mrs. Wong. I felt so confused, whether to feel happy or sad. In the end, I ended up both crying out for joy and weeping tears of sadness. I would never forget the happy days of the 'Innovative Class' Dance. The joys and pains of being part of this dance is totally beyong words. I'm getting so emotional that I'm writing so much. Ok, lets continue. The concert was unforgettable, and I felt so emotional that I literally screamed my heart out. For many of you, you would never see me do that for sure. :) Tears of sadness dribbled down the cheeks of many sec 4 and 3CCA members, be it Dance or even Guzheng. There is always an end to good things. Then again, I just can't bear to see this dance, and the sec 4 members leave me. This must be my longest entry ever. Hahaz. May the memories of the wonderful past remain in our hearts always.
