This is good to know since most cobras would rather run away than attack you, and will only attack if they feel they are in danger. So, if you ever see one, you better keep still, motherfucker.  Another odd fact they said is that lobsters can only see in 12 colours. (Didn't the Atari or some silly game console have a similar number of colours back in the day?)
