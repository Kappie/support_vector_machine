Is who I am a problem? Am I a mental disease?  Sure, i forget things. Sure, I can't concentrate on the  things that matter.  What if i'm just concentrating on things that matter to me?  I probably won't want to draw as much anymore.  I like drawing.  End transmission.  (PS BUY DRUGZ CHEEP OFFSHORE PHARMACY  urlLink jimbo01_gggdrugzcheep@spamland.com )
