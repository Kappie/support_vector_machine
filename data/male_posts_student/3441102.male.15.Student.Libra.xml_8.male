When everyone else was asleep my own insomnia and some fat fucks snoring kept me up. Gliding was real cool but right now I'm so tired I keep swaying, feels real fucked-up. I almost fell asleep but then one of my brother's friends phoned and no-one else was in so I had an argument that he should phone his moblile. Well I was pretty hyped up so I decided to play some bass. Wrote some lyrics for the "band" to view later and I brought my dad a father's day present. Damn I'm bored. Geoff Hurst biography. For my dad. I'm reading 1984 by George Orwell. Pretty good. Listening to Jam. Download Eton Rifles, Thats entertainment and down in the tube station at midnight. Genius songs.
