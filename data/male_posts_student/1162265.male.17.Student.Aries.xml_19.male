It's not really much of a problem for me though.  I was sick today, I could tell I was going to be last night, but suprisingly I'm already recovered, even though I sadly won't be able to swim in the meet tommorow.... Oh well, the season has been good to me anyway.  I guess it's the way life goes about.  I gotta dig up a quiz to take now, so I can post the results.      urlLink  What Was Your PastLife?    Word, that makes sense.  I love the picture in the survy, with the person going through the cycle of life, and then returning to Brahma, I love that type of art.  Almost as cool as Arabian, and Egyptian Art.  Ayyam-i-ha is in 22 days, if I want to do anything to see what Baha'i is like, I really, really should go to New York, and check it out.  Hopefully it will be a very fun, and entertaining holiday.
