Friday, (not the black in the story of robinson Cru???). hm...i forgo brkfst in the morning. but was still late for band. utterly disappointed with myself.  chem n math lec: sit beside "Best Frends", was toking abt "periods".giggle pls.   PE:  Nus changing the pe T using MGS method taught by best frend. so damn funny. she struggled for so long to get her clothes changed. fancy to think that Yt could change faster using the same mtd. captains' ball AGAIN. battle of the sexes AGAIN.gal won marginally AGAIN. but this time round, there's improvement. the ratio of gals: guys was 2:1 rather than the usual 3:1. one comment: guys r MCP! will u die making ladies happy by losing the game??  econ lec: not worth mentioning  math: KO SZE!!! i've let u down!!! i din bring my hmwk!! haha, den there's an "IAN" joke.  econ: I LOVE MS NG! she's a powerful ladies!! she really eased phobia for tutorial!!! "Charismatic" speaker..... every1 listen n din tok..... i really hate tutors who r slow, unclear of wad they r doing, n not able to grasp pupils' attention. gd time management.... we were dismissed promptly.  quite happy that our class are getting along well after june hols. think those pools n movie really can forge bonds. and the gals hor, they discovered their gossipy nature. now that the "mean" gals get together, they would maximise their potential ....n CRAP!
