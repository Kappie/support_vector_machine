In her  urlLink  4 August post  , entitled “Fight the Powers that be” she writes:      Today, when "Question Authority" is mass-produced on a bumper sticker, and everybody wants to stand with the Little Guy against the Powers, the problem isn't so much that no one is questioning the Powers so much as that no one can agree on who they are. Everyone thinks they're an outgroup these days. The poor feel oppressed by the rich and the rich feel oppressed by the government, liberals complain that conservatives control business and conservatives complain liberals control the media and education, libertines complain of being censored while puritans feel they're losing the culture war, and so on and so forth. The temptation isn't so much to worship the Powers as it is convincing yourself that whatever you're already doing is standing with Jesus against the Powers.     Wow!  This reminded me of a very interesting workshop that I had attended at Friends General Conference ( urlLink  FGC  ) more than ten years ago. The focus was to study the Bible from different perspectives (e.g. feminist, creation spirituality, Liberation Theology) and how these different perspectives illuminated or contrasted with how early Friends approached the scriptures.  The day that the group was given a basic introduction to Liberation Theology the workshop leader used Mary’s “Magnificat” (Luke 1:46-55) as an example of Liberation Theology’s assertion that the Bible describes a God who shows preferential regard for those that are the most vulnerable in a society (in this case, the poor). The specific verses regarding this read:      51. The Lord has used his powerful arm to scatter those who are proud. 52. He drags strong rulers from their thrones and puts humble people in places of power. 53. God gives the hungry good things to eat, and sends the rich away with nothing.     The workshop leader then asked an intriguing question. Where did we, who had grown up middle-class and white (all of the attendees were people of European descent and from middle-class backgrounds) in one of the wealthiest and most powerful nations of the world, “position” ourselves in these verses? Did we consider ourselves as one of those who was humble and hungry or as one of those who was proud and rich? She explained that Liberation Theology tended to interpret the Bible from a communal perspective rather than reading it as a text that was designed solely for an individual’s personal illumination. Thus, if we viewed these verses at a purely individualistic level, most of us might think of ourselves as one of those whom God protects and loves; or at least as one of those who was on the side of the “little guy” (along with God) against the powers (of the world). Yet, when taken from a larger, systemic perspective, as a  group  we easily could be lumped in with those labeled “proud”, “strong”, and “rich” for, after all, each of us had lived and continued to live a relatively privileged existence compared to the world’s “humble”, “poor”, and “vulnerable”.  Several people were unhappy with this interpretation. They asserted that God viewed everyone equally; that is was unfair to “lump” all Americans into the same group; that the notion that the Divine shows a “preference” of one group over another was antithetical to Friends’ belief that everyone had the Inward Light within them.  But, the workshop leader held to her point by asking us to consider how we might, if each of us had been born in a poor, mostly agrarian and traditional culture, view an American’s status in the world. If we had been born into such “lowly” circumstances wouldn’t it make sense to view those born in the U.S. as being “rich” and having greater power in the world? As people trailed out of the room it seemed that few were convinced that, given all that each of them had suffered in their lives and/or had done as individuals to fight for social justice, that they could still be viewed as one of those “powerful”, “haughty”, “rich” folks brought down by God in order to liberate those who had been humbled and made low by the “powers” of the world. People seemed much more energized by what feminist and creation spirituality perspectives had to offer on other days during the week-long workshop.  Nonetheless, the idea has stayed with me. And it seems to be echoed in what Camassia so nicely states in her post. I wonder how often I have made my political and social views into idols so that I can feel that I am on the “correct” side of an issue. At a broader level how many times do we (liberal) Friends in the U.S. think of ourselves as being on the side of the “little guy” fighting “against the powers” when, in fact, we might actually be on the other side of the equation, which includes self-righteousness, sanctimoniousness, pride, and privilege? Do we   truly   believe that there is a greater Truth than our own political and social views?
