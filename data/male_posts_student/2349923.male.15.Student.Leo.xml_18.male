Why is it that some of the sec 2 cadets choose to be ignorant about this. Where is the spirit of the Sec 2 squad which I used to have. I know some might give me a simple reason of no internet connection at home. But if you are really on about NPCC and also the pride of the sec 2 squad, surely you will find a way to get into here at least once. Either by going to the library or even use the school computers to get in here. Hopefully I get to see more of you guys in here okie..Please.  Anyway, I'm here to update some of the latest changes in the squad okie. Its got to do with the post for IC and other posts as well. Here there are..    Squad IC - Cpl Hanisah Asst Squad IC(1) - Cpl Brenda Asst Squad IC(2)  Treasurer - Cpl Syed Abdullah Programme IC - Cpl Wong Yee Meng Attendance IC - L/Cpl Chu Sin Yi    So from now on, instead of approaching Carla and Yee Meng, please approach the newly appointed ICs okie. Carla and Yee Meng, you guys have done a great job for the first half of the year. Thanks a million especially for organising those BBQ party and also the picnic we had the other time. Thanks.
