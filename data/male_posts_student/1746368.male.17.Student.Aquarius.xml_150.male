I don't think many studies have been made on people who this occurs to.  How much wood  would  a woodchuck chuck?  I think I am going to go back and watch Space Ghost. Finish up the second disc before Derek takes it back to Blockbuster.  "I don't know half of you half as well as I should like, and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve." --Bilbo  P.S. I just wanted to know what you guys thought of my little quotes? Do you guys want me to keep putting these or not? Post a comment.
