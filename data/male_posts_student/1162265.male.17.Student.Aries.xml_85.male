Like he comes in today, when I felt like my soul was lacking any life, and says "Oh, clean the litter box, and we're going to your grandmothers in half an hour."  That was an hour ago.  I dropped what I was doing, made my grandmother a birthday card and put off just calling her.  Then I made another card.  All por nada so far and it's only getting later.  He's so dumb at times....   Torpey has a pretty cool website on the bright side.  It's so business like.  Then Kirills Xanga... man... they must teach those guys some heavy computer stuff in Russia, because his Xanga is the most together one I've yet to see.
