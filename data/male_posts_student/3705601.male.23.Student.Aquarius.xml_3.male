Rock symphonies are stories told in music without actors or dancers, which is what separates it from a musical. These rock symphonies range in time from 10 or 15 minutes to hours. These rock symphonies are commonplace among progressive rock groups such as Rush and Dream Theater. Rush has had a few of these symphonies like "2112" while Dream Theater thought it fit to have a whole album musically tell the story of a man solving a murder mystery in his dreams (Metrolis Pt.2 Scenes from a Memory). I think that these rock symphonies are very clever and when done well (I do not remember one being done badly), aare quite entertaining, although sometimes, stories are more difficult to articulate using music. Otherwise, it is very clever and artistic on the part of these performers to do such a thing. As a musician, I am floored by the musical skill of these artists, as a fan, I am in deep admiration of these guys because these rock symphonies are very entertaining and should be made more common.
