Im going to miss most of the Sharks games so im really sad about that (i hope i get to see the game down south)  Im going to say a "short section" on the Sharks game since my sanity has been questioned because of talking about the sharks a little too much. Well, here it goes.... The sharks won on Saturday 3-1 beating the St. Louis blues. My favorite player ("Patty" Marleau) scored 3 goals which means he got the hat trick. He scored 2 on the power play and 1 shorthanded. He is only the second player in sharks history to score a hat trick. They play on Monday in St. Louis...wish them luck!  I hope that was short enough....
