I went to the movies last night with John from A Faith Called Chaos. That guy is totally awesome, he reminds me of someone but I can't pin it down. We went and saw signs and it was alright. It was more about the battle with faith and the ideas of fear and hope than the aliens. The aliens were pretty freaky but I think they stole some ideas from spiderman. The poison dispenser and the shoot with the creepy fucker on the barn roof. That shoot and the footage from the brazilian birthday party were pretty creepy.  The theatere was fucking packed, hot, and the side speakers weren't working. I was seriously sweating all over.   Fuck, I have a headache. My mom is coming over today to help me clean up the apartment. That shouldn't take too long. I think I'm gonna go to subway and get some food.   current mood:  complacent current music: the radio sucks
