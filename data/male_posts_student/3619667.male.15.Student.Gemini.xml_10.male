I am now tired and very itchy and eager to see mah lady (try being faithful for a week when you can have five women hanging off you at any given moment). It's back to the grind now: music, volunteer... sleep.  Next on the agenda: Let's find a purpose for this post. Everyone is gone their own ways, and I am just now -as of two minutes- missing DCI's 2nd round of shows in Orlando. On the topic of band, I might as well mention that I met a few band geeks like myself at camp. Pretty amazing, the whole band bond.  I will post more when I.
