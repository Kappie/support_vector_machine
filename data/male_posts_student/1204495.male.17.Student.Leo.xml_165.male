And then look at what some people do to them, basically destroy them by conning them into parting with their hard earned money, this really bugs me and pisses me off, why do that to an old person, one who played their part in the war, so you could live in the world like it is today, they played their part for the country and look at what happens to them, they are seen as easy targets because they are old and frail, that may be so, but next time you see an old person, flash them a smile, you never know that smile could warm their day up for them, just be one little smile you could be making that old persons day, or even stopping to talk to them, you never know what it can do. Smiling at anyone, no matter what they are like, can bring benifts not only to that person but also to yourself, smile and you'll feel happy, and also make that other person ahppy as well, so just smile and be friendly, what is the point in wasting life in being angry and annoyed, look at yourself deep down and think to yourself "i am happy with the way i am" trust me, you'll feel better for it
