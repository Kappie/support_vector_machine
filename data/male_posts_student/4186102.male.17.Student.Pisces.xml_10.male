But also i've noticed that everyone is in a rush... no one takes the time to do something properly. even my boss, he rushed this one job and fucked it right to hell.. all the mesurements are wrong. and even me doing simple around the house things... yesterday i had to cut the lawn, i had nothing to do all day so of course i did it. but i tried to do it so fast that when i was done i'm like why the hell did i go so fast. i had nothing to do yet i still rushed it. its like that one country song goes "in a hurry to get things do alot. rushin', rushin' till lifes no fun. all i got to do is live and die but i'm in a hurry and dont know why." this is so true to amost everyone i talk to... they have no reason to do things so fast. i think is human nature again. what is with the human race?  ttfn Cody
