Got physics tuition on saturday.........sian..........but nvm, later i'm gonna lao yu sheng........hmm, i've got no time to rant about God, so maybe on Saturday night...........  But about Eason chan..........hmmm, imo, he writes the ONE of the best love songs, (by definition of best that is....). American pop love songs are just too superficial and lacking in depth, even though, when i first listened to ji mo rang ni gen kuai le, it really struck me as simple, pop, stuff. Esp. in the song structure and melody, cos' i'm more used to the opeth, beethoven, kinda complicated song structure and writing style. But his lyrics are really quite good, and really reflects what i feel, apart from being catchy, he's really a good songwriter anyway.  But anyway, got tons of test next week, so gotta study, good thing for Hari Raya Haji though, hope that every terrorist who attack those blessed pilgrims who give me one more day to study get impaled alive on a pole, and hopefully that'll shut them up about their "DEATH TO THE AMERICAN SATAN!!!!!!!" BS........lol, btw, the above paragraph is just a product of a bored and stressed mind, so do not really take much notice..........  So today...........good thing (a bad thing hopefully..) for you all, u all dun get to see me rant, but like I said, i'll do it on saturday........so you CAN't escape from that, this blog, is first and foremost, a ranting space.......
