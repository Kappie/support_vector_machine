Today, I turned up for Citizenship, which involved lots of essay questions but little difficulty. I also had my German speaking test, in which I got repeatedly asked about food. For the role play I said that I wanted to be a chef in the Hotel, for the questions she asked me lots about what food I likes, and in my presentation I also said lots about it. So much so, that if you listen to the tape of the test my catch phrase appears to be 'Es hat gut geschmeckt!' (It has good taste!) So, yeah. It's looking like a C.
