Beutey and the Beast  lacks a name for the sheer purpose that his name is irrelevent. He serves as a vessel through which the audiance can implant themselves into and learn a moral lesson about being compassionate and civil. Cigarette Man, from the X-Files (Horrible peice of ass, of a show, By the way. Possibly the worst science fiction series since the original Star Trek. Thats right. I said it. Shatner is horrible, and the writting is piss poor. Granted, the show did introduce the world to Leonard Nimoy and created the Star Trek universe that would evolve into "The Next Generation", but that hardly makes up for the horrible excuse for a show. X-Files is worse.), is the governments' seditious influence personified. He is the portrait of a soul-less, mind warped hand of a administration bent on keeping secrets secret. The lack of a full, "Christian" name, gives the writer the ability to demonize or altruize (Is that a word?) their character.
