Welll, I've reached about that much tonight, but I'm not satisfied yet. I plan on finishing 4 ^^;; And it's probably possible. Haven't shown my report card to my parents yet... all I know is that the all the yelling and lecturing will take up too much of my precious time, so I'll show it to them as late as possible, lol ^^;;   Anyways, felt like taking a break.. so now here I am... seems like it'll be a pretty rushed rush to the end. ah well, i look forward to it *grins* the only thing I'm worried about is that my parents might transfer me back ... that would really suck. Sooooo... back to work for me.    ~Chronos
