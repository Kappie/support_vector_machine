Iwasn't quite sure what I was doing though, so I had to find Kaitlin *Jensen, but she wasn't around.  Then I logged into a computer terminal to try and find her, and she IMed me.  As  her words popped up, I heard her voice.  Apparently, she'd integrated herself with the ships AI.  She explained some stuff to me, but I don't remember any of it.  Then I went to a conference room where Everitt was giving a poetry reading.  When he finished, someone gave a talk about this bizzarre and very cool looking alien species.  Somehow Zach *Dzuba and a member of that species were assigned to work with me on building a model of a member of this species.  With the help of Kaitlin's disembodied voice that only I could hear, we built a really realistic one.  On our way to present it, Dana *Dreutzler tripped me and I fell into a lit match I was inexplicably holding and burned my hand. Next thing I remember, I got to a place where show choir pictures were being taken.  SOmehow, though, and this is very vague, we ended up fighting over this egg, with diferent weapons that kept appearing.  Thats all I remember.  There wasn't really much of an ending.
