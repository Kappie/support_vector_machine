Somewhere along the way I saw a bus, and decided to catch it. I rode for a long time on the roof of the bus with my shirt off, enjoying the breeze and the sun, until someone told me to get off. When I got off the bus, there were five people I knew playing around. I only remember that one of them was Aaron Gray. Next thing I knew, we were all armed; four of them were wearing armour and carrying both a long and short sword, while myself and the other 3 were wearing leather armour. I carried a bow and a longsword, plus a wood katana on my back that I made. We ran through the forest, Steel armour vs Leathers. Our group was faster as we weren't weighed down, and decided to take our stand at the top of the hill. We got there easily, and had plenty of time to rest before the others showed up.  I fought Aaron. In the practice round I beat him easily. But in the real fight his sword turned him invisible. We fought for a long time even though I couldn't see him, but in the end we both scored on each other.  Then I was throwing together a giant party, somehow involving little cherries. It was going to be a great show.
