So when you really like someone a lot, and you have an incredible friendship, and things seem like they're on a fast track to where you want them to be, the best step to proceed to is definitely:  a) Keep things the way they are, keep spending time together, and hope that you get some clear sign as to how to proceed; b) Make a move, hope it's received well; c) Get drunk and sleep together.  Again, I'm a complete idiot.  Conventional wisdom is completely lost on me, apparently.  Things were going SO well... I had even decided not to rush things, to believe that if they were going to happen, they were going to happen.  I'd actually reached a point where I felt it was inevitable, and so I was even MORE okay with holding off.  A date here, a date there... maybe soon we'd be dating legitimately, and wouldn't that be nice?  Then I got a phone call at 2:30am, which was innocent enough.  Then I made it something it wasn't, and though it was something I wanted to happen, that's not how I wanted it to happen.  We both deserve better, we deserve to have things happen under circumstances where we both know exactly what's happening and the consequences.  I'm afraid that she thinks I've lost some amount of respect for her, and I'm terrified that she's lost some for me.  I'm not safe anymore.  Fuck.  She's not to blame for this, and I'm not entirely to blame, either.  I'm not a bad person, and I think that if I'd not been drinking, I would have showed more respect for both of us, and stopped things at innocent making out.  I'm so scared right now that it's never going to be the same.  So, so scared.  V, could use your help right now.
