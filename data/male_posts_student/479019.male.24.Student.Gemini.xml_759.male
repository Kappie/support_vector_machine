I lost my photocopies of some readings for Monday, that means I have to get my ass to campus today.  I watched  League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  last night. It wasn't as bad as Ebert said, but it has some problems. For example, they never explained why the vampire chick could walk around in the day time.   Now playing some  Bad Religion .  **
