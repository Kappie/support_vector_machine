"isang tulog na lang...!" as in that old Jolibee ad on tv.   as (probably) none of you know, i'm a medical intern who shouldn't have the time to surf the Net much less maintain a blog. however, i've been putting this writing thing on hold for the longest time, it seems, and if this is the outlet for me to write, then so be it. enough of this, for now, will just serve up a few tidbits on why this blog exists in later posts, along with other stories, fictional or otherwise.   "isang tulog na lang, Jolibee na naman!  ang araw lulubog, bukas mabubusog...!"   tama ba? anyhoo, one day more and i'm out of the pediatrics ward for good. Good riddance? well, not really, but close enough.pediatrics as a specialization is among the last of my considerations after i pass the board exams for medicine (naks! confident na confident a!). for one, i don't think i have the patience to deal with (at least) 2 patients, the parent  child,for each consult.it's depressing enough as it is to see so many kids (especially in the Philippines) sick and dying ofillnesses otherwise curable/manageable/preventable if not forpovertyplaying such asignificant factor. each time i face a patient, whether at the Out-Patient or wards, i have that thought lingering at the back of my mind.   my other rants about pediatrics are much less... serious (significant?), bordering on petty and childish. gusto ko medyo "benign" na rotation, hehe. sino bang ayaw? i don't want to end my day physically spent and emotionally drained with nothing look forward to exceptlie down and sleep, knowing full well i'd be facing the same situation the following day.   i'm just venting here. i really want to be a doctor, a good one at that, such that wherever you put me, i'll do my best for my patients, even if sometimes the best i can do for them is to "make do" with what i have. there is a silver lining to this cloud, rest assured, which i'll hopefully share soon.   how this postturned out to be serious is beyond me. i just wanted to say, "hey! i'm out of the toxic pediatric wards! i'llfinally have some time for myself, my friends, my interests..."   one day more. ang galing lang talaga, 'no? last duty ko bukas, kung kailang shifting out na kami... oh well. ganun talaga e.
