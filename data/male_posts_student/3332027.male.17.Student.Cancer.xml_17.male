(He's my friend but, for some reason i just refer to him as my ex because I have the feeling we won't be coming back to eachother) i kept trying to figure out why he did. Today is game 7 of Piston's vs Nets. I made a bet with one of my friends that if the Piston's win, i have to teach her how to give a goof lap dance. If i win, she has to be my personal assitant for the day! After school, I went with my friend Jasmin from school to the city to go get Starbucks.(LoL, we're such dorks, we took the ferry over to Manhatten for a cup of cold coffee!) I Loved the conversations we have. I rather talk to a girl then a guy, because most girls have that deep emotion/connection with themselves. Most guys only care about sports, shoes, and the sluts they sexed up. I called my ex around 4 P.M. He has no clue why his brother called me. It's ok. I asked him what was going on with him. He said it was ok and he was going to go out today to eat and walk around his neighborhood. He said he would call me back later. I'm not holding my breath. If he calls, he calls. If he doesn't, tomorrow is a new day. I still feel very close and attached to him. On the ferry, i found where i wrote mines and his initials on the ferry. I wrote something else next to it. It's on the "American Legion" ferry all the way in the back the third row on the left by the window and the door leading outside into the outside side seats. Its written on the seat next to Jasmin *heart* Chris. I want to show my ex what i wrote one day. Maybe he will find it on his own. I miss him alot and again even though were friends, i still want him in that way where our feelings for eachother were growing. Even though i told him that its natural that him caring for me and attachment decreases, mine hasn't. I want him and miss him the same. I want him to want me like he use to. My serious and playful nagging pushed him away. Its true. Seperation does make the Heart Grow Fonder. As a friend, i Love him. But I want to love him more then a friend, but i can't.  I miss how he touches me and rubs me the right way (Not sexual, but how he cudddles me and i put my head on his chest or shoulders, the way we would lay down or watch a movie/tv and i would just be close to him).I miss how we would just talk then just have silence, then i would annoy him after. I miss the serious conversations we had and when he would fuck around with me. I miss him alot. I wonder if he misses me the same way...? Something tells me hes moved on and doesn't want to say anything. I'm burning until he comes back to me. Usher - Burn was our song. It's a song i'll never forget.     "Something 'bout the way you looked at me  Made me think for a moment,  That maybe we were meant to be  Living our lives seperately  And it's strange that things change  But not me wanting you so desperately"
