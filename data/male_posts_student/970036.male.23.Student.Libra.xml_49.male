I had planned on commenting on my  new job  or even the fantastic season of  ball hockey  I've been engaged in with the gang from Vegreville, but I'll wrap this up quickly: the job pays decent and is only moderately zombifying, and those blue street hockey balls are the greatest thing we've adopted since protective goalie equipment. And while I'm bringing up goalies, it's a shame that Russel, our other vetran all-star goaltender, felt inadequate without adding an additional 3 inches. It's still how you use what you've got, Russ, but more power to you, I suppose.  Updated, on the right, the movies I've watched lately and my  Ball Hockey Statistics  from this season of minding the twine. Ugh...that indoor record just won't do!    Currently listening to: iTunes radio stations refresh, refresh, refresh...
