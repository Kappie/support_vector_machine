It's so hard to find internet connection in the boondoks. Anyway, I've been to Negros Occidental and stayed in a place called Kabankalan and it's really, really... ummm... oriental... no... make that, really, really so far from civilization. Am I making any sense? Whatever. Anyway, that's where I've been and right now I'm in Antipolo although just last night, I was in a ship and was feeling drunk from all the wavering of the ship from the waves. Wooohhh... At least I was still able to top the Karaoke with Puff the Magic Dragon. And I didn't vomit or anything like that even with all the food I ate. :p
