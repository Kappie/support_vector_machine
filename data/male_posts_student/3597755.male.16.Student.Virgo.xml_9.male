Most people think the world is a great place, that all people can be your friends, if you are nice to people, people will like you and that evil does not exist. Well, ofcourse they've heard about evil but think it's far away. Their world is perfect. They live in total bliss. Everybody knows ignorance is bliss. In this case bliss is caused by ignorance indeed.  People commit suicide. Ignorant people are shocked by that and don't want to think about that. When they see Britney die in 'everytime' they are in tears. Believe me, people tell me they cried.  When I swear people say I have to watch my language. Fuck them, there is no fucking word which caused immediate death to the shitty person who heard it. People tell me I should be more positive. I get even more angry and negative towards the human being in general that way.  People listen to 'everytime' by Britney and think "O, that's a mellow song, and it is so sensitive, it's great". Time to wake up people. She is after your money. She didn't write it, she doesn't have a good voice and the lyrics are crap. She sells her music with her body. All bubblegum pop singers and their fans should be put on another planet. People think they're sophisticated when they listen to a sensitive sounding song. They're wrong.  Here in Holland 20% of all television viewers zap away when there are images of real suffering people on the television. People are to fucking blind to see what a fix they're in. Do you expect a fool to see what a fix he's in? (I guess not) The world is a vampire sent to drain...
