Last two weeks we went to Washington Park and we had teams put together and had to come across some obsticles. Then we had planned to go to Henry's Farm,but there was some unforeseen circumstances. We ended up going to Lincoln Park Zoo. It was fun.I'm looking forward going on more fieldtrips. These fieldtrips are not just fun, butone can learn too. Theclasses at Northeasterare great. The teachershelp us understand subjects that are boring in a fun and interesting way.They make subjects look easy, the way they explain it.      At high school the teachers try their hardest to make every subject complicated, but I catch on fast. I know that high school teachers don't try to make it hard forstudents but the problem is that the teachers don't have another way or method to explain the subject.     Most of the classes, the teachers put us in groups so we can figure some problems out. Its interesting because you don't know who you are going to end up with in your group. Or sometime we just get together with other people we know.
