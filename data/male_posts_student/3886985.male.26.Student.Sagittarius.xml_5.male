With luck, they should be taken care of in the next few days, so I'll be in a better mood.  Here's big news, though: my parents finally replaced the upstairs air conditioner. This is HUGE. Instead of my room being 85-90 degrees during the day, it's down to about 75-78 degrees. For those of you who haven't seen my room, it's on the upstairs corner of the house, and has six windows... Three on the east side, and three on the west. (I've got a great story about the windows, and the gated community we live in, but that's for another time.) Because my room faces the east and west, I get sun on my room the entire daylight period, making it REAL FREAKING HOT. In fact, if you take an indoors thermometer and stand just outside my doors, and compare the readings, you'll get a variation of 8-10 degrees. And that's from walking 3 feet through a doorway into my room, because the hallway doesn't get ANY sun on it. Bleh... I hate the house we live in, but that's another story, too.
