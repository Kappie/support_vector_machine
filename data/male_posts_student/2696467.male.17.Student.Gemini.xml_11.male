I'm hoping the roads ice up again and we have another delay tomorrow ;). You know whats weird? I went on e-bay today looking for a NES and found them to be priced around $50 and up!!! Thats crazy, I wish our old one didn't break. Right now I'm stuck playing computer roms, but I'd like to have the actual system again someday. Ya know what really pisses me off? When people take their cell phones out for no reason other than to say "Hey look I got a cell phone!!!" Today on my bus this girl pulls hers out and just stares at it the whole bus ride pushing random buttons, Maybe she was playing a game? well I dont think so, b/c shed push a button, wait a bit push another...and she was also popping her gum like every 10 seconds really loudly and it really made me wanna just yell at her, but I'm a shy person so I just cranked the volume up on my cd player. But I just cant stand people who try to show off their cell phones. This kid in my first period class will flip his cover up and down the whole class, I don't know why, but its freakin stupid. Same goes with people (like My sister) today who pulled her $2 of lunch money out in her hand for no reason other than to flash it around at people like shes rich.......and people who pull out their wallet and count money in front of you.....I mean if I had like $1,000 I'd flash it a bit, but not 2, 5, or $10, I mean come on!!!!       Well Thats my 2 cents for today.         Later,        -Haze-        a.k.a. Jon!  (BTW I'm normally grounded during weekdays from the internet so you won't see my blog updated too much during the week. Today I happen to be working on something so I can get on ;) )
