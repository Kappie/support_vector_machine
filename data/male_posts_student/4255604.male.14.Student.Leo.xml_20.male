Also i am a member at blog.chip-india.com and pchardware.com . If you know people post posts for 2 reasons,they want to help the other person out:tell him waht all above mentioned things are wrong or right and be to the point.Secondly it could be to continue with an incomplete conversation,as time passes it doesn't remain a formal post but a 2-3line amedment and conversation or sometimes even joking and not really that rude as i was with Mohit.
