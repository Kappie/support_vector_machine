My brother carried the banner, and according to him, Alysa wants to have mad sex with me.....but I already knew that. Damnit, I know thats not how you spell her name, oh well.  Quote of the Day: When I walked by Mr. Black Guy in wellness, he yelled TALIBAN!!!! at me over and over.  If anyone caught what I edited out of this post....well....guess what that means....I lied.
