This was interspersed with chatter with Leon Toh and him trying to hook me up with various girls. Oh! I charmed them alright. Charmed them out of their seats and away from me is what I did. Ho..  Have created a picture gallery. It's at  urlLink http://oracion.mypicgallery.com . Will put the link up on the sidebar soon. There's only a few photos us coz it takes hell long to upload them. The first album is about my happy days. It's not all the photos that I've got, but these will do to bring you the idea.  Will be in a play by drama soon. I'll get stripped and kicked and tied up. No darlings, it's not raunchy. It's a comedy of words. Don't expect elaborate songs, dance, lights, sounds, or props coz you wont get any. If you wish to place orders for tickets, hold your horses. I don't know the details but I think it'll be staged in late July. Will supply further details when I am furnished with them.  Yesterday I asked you to go love your Parents. Today I'm going to tell you to appreciate grass. Seriously. It's under-appreciated, but is so vital to our survival. If you don't buy all that, just get in contact with Ma Nature.  Began to think about Zel again. This cannot be. There has to be a solution. But really, cutting helps for a while. I stood in the dark and watched you brush your hair. Hurrah for 62A. Meet me there.
