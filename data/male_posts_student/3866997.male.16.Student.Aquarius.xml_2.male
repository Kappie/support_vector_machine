Even greater than this though is when the realization hits you that its not a dream. Its reality. They say truth is much stranger than fiction, and I suppose its the same way with dreams sometimes. Occasionally you get something so wonderful cross your path that you can't believe this reality could have surpassed your expectations so much. What was I looking for? I was looking for someone who I could tolerate. Someone who I could stand to be around for a prolonged period of time and the scariest part is that I think that's what happens to many of us. We get so convinced that there is nothing better that we settle. I was on my way to doing that until I ran across Drew. Whenever I talk to him I can't stop smiling. Thinking about kissing him knots up my stomach and my heart races. I dare not confuse this with love, that would be stupid, but I believe the potential is certainly there for he and I to have something wonderful. He makes me feel like I'm good enough just like I am and don't have to impress him in order to gain his affection. I've got it already by virtue of just being me. That's something fairly new to me. The other two guys I've been invovled with have always made me feel so much lower than they were, like I could never be good enough for them. I sit here now in absolute awe and amazement at how the most wonderful things slip into your life in the quietest ways.  The Moral of the Story: You will find financial success  in bed .
