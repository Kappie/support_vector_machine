The hot girl in the white midriff tank top, spaghetti straps, carrying what looks like a musical score but could be a lab practical, walking in, blonde hair tied back simply, carelessly, efficiently.  I notice her in passing; she's hot, but if I'm going to ogle, I'll prefer to do it with a mental snapshot so she doesn't get uncomfortable.  The guy sitting across from me notices her once as she passes, eyes traveling head to ass, staying on ass.  He looks back to his Norton anthology, probably enjoying some of Christina Rossetti's better work, the work that got me in trouble in high school because I knew it was about cunnilingus, but I wasn't supposed to say it out loud.  He looks up agian.  Ass.  She's not looking.  She didn't catch him.  I did.  She passes agian, this time with a friend who's not as hot.  He doesn't look...he'd get caught.  I can look this time.  Ass.  Good ass.  Back to Goblin Market.
