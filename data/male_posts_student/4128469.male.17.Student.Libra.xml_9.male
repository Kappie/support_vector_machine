But it was dodgy Mr Downey gave me a tinke at 1 to say emmm my interview got changed so i didny know where i was goin. Then it got changed back. Ohhhh dodgy company eh. Then they hadn't heard of me or him. Then they leave you for 40 mins to fill out a 5 min form then a peach of a script. You get the script like hello may i speak to mr/mrs smith but i didn't click you say mrs if its a woman obviously and i am calling this Claire character Mr Smith then makin a balls up of it soundin like a retard then the interview..... What did you think of your previous manager ? ehhh he was a bit of a gimp to be honest. ohhh or how would you feel about your shifts being suddenly changed ? Emmm i'd probably be quite angry cos i've not done anything have i ? Then they go we are talking about extraordinary events such as 9/11 you don't want to be seeling death insurance then do you. Fair enough. So then at the end have you got any questions ? Naw. then i thought i'd received the knockback... "Welll heres my tip for your next interview have questions prepared beforehand so you sound keen" Sounds like a knockback doesn't it but it wasnt this company are dodgy i will go in and kick some arse of course and be out in a week. Its dodgy might not even be able to do it cos it starts at 5 if i get into Strathy im fucked. Aw well and plus the ££ i was informed of on the phone was suddenly down 25% aw well. Mr downey had his second interview and they said they would phone him we have faith in this figure but when they asked why he wants to work there or something he came out wae cos the moneys good the guys a tit. And young Michael's interview is next Wednesday so there might still be a posse. Ciao
