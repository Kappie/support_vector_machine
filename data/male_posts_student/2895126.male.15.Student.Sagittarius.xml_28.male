Anyway, today was a day off, so I plan to actually get my homework done at home today. Schools should be required to give a day off every two weeks. We need to re-energize, and the weekends don't really help.  Dad's going to Las Vegas for a business trip. Maybe he'll get me something... (as Alek is enveloped by greed)  Last night Gordon successfully convinced me I don't have free will. I hate philosophers... No, actually, I'd like to learn more about it, but I'll wait until college. That kind of thing robs you of a certain innocence you can never get back. After you have insight into some things, it changes everything.   Most people are bothered by those passages of Scripture they do not understand, but the passages that bother me are those I do understand.   (Mark Twain)
