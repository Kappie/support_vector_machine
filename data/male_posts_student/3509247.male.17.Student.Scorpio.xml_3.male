Of course I've had many interesting customers come through, but I'm beginning to see and recognize the same ones that come in daily.  I'm learning the fine art of running.  I worked back in drive through yesterday, and I had lunch with JDR today.  Friend trouble is on the rise as Colleen and I aren't getting along too well.  I haven't talked with Stephanie since that one night when she didn't talk to me up until Wednesday.  It was nice seeing her again, but we didn't talk all that much.  If I were a little less busy, I'd prolly call her, but I don't have time.  The thing is she acted like she may call me sometime and then she never does it.  I don't think she's mad at me or anything, but I so wish she would get a hold of me so we could talk like we used to.  I need my best friends back.  Tomorrow (prolly today by time I get this posted) I get my wisdom teeth out.  Thank you so much all of you out there that are praying for me.  It's really an encouragement to me.  Here's a random side comment (I don't intend on making this a normal item in my blogs).  Two music artists make me think of specific people.  Whenever I hear a song by Dido, I always think about Melissa; and whenever I hear a song by No Doubt, I think about Colleen.  Don't ask me why because I really don't know.  I think it maybe something about the artist themselves.  I can almost hear Colleen's when I hear any no doubt song and the storylines, melancholy mood, and smooth R style of Dido somehow just remind me of Melissa.  Eh, well there it is for whatever it's worth to ya.  Night ya'll.  -Josh
