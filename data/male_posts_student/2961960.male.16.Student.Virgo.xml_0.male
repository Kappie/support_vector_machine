GMail has this idea of a conversation rather than an email message, so it would make sense to group messages together of the same subject in the same conversation.  Further more, I believe that is how we should view email messages anyway, as conversations.  If someone is replying back to you they really talking back to you like you're in a conversation.  I plan to get pictures up as soon as I figure that out....
