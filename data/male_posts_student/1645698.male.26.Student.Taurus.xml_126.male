There's a paper due on Tuesday and I have no idea what in the world to write about.  I'll probably end up paraphrasing the whole book anyway.  On a lighter side, I went to a concert last night, and it rocked!  The band that I went to see were really great!  It was a completely hipster crowd though, but that can't be helped.  There was this one girl who kept crowd surfing, she was so cool.  The the main show came on next and they were SOOOO OLD!  It was kind of funny in a sad morbid kind of way.  They were REALLY old!  The lead singer was all jumping around and stuff, and meanwhile I was thinking, "Is this guy gonna have a heart attack soon?"  The worst thing about it was, it wasn't that bad!  They were so energetic and jumping around and stuff.  And there were ALOT of people that were there to see them!  I left in the middle of their show, but if I could've, i would've stayed for the whole thing.    Tis all.
