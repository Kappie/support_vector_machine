You could almost feel Lester Holt's struggle to keep from counting down the last seconds, new years style.  The dude had this grin on his face the whole time like he was doing a Superbowl pregame show or something.  Their graphics were likewise x-treme.  They had a night vision shot of the Baghdad skyline in splitscreen the whole time, so that we could catch the very beginning of the carnage, as if it were to come at that exact second.  Lester's disgust with the fact that he didn't get to show the world a veiw of the first bombs falling was palpable.  It was entertaining to watch him go from almost creaming his jeans in pre-war x-tacy to bitter, bitter dissapointment.  Meanwhile, MSNBC continued to interupt coverage with viagra comercials and other bits of commerce.  My favorite part was when they spoke with another one of their correspondants in Kuait near the border.  Apparently, this large network could only afford to send him into the field with the webcam that they got for free from Earthlink.  Somehow, everyone else had normal cameras, and his was this crappy, blocky, distorted thingey.  Perhaps this is their attempt to provide some sort of "gritty realism".  What a crock.   P.S. Title quote is from page 47 of  urlLink Buttlord GT .  Afterthought: Has anyone else noticed what a group of shills for the Republicans MSNBC are?  i.e. Their own show hosts telling people who are against the war to "shut up" (yep, actual quote).
