I am going to Sarah's house after I am done doing this.  Today has been alright.  I had to work but it wasn't too bad.  I got payed today!!!  My check was $228.  I was pleased.  It was so hard to get up for work today.  I was really tired and my bed was extremely comfortable.  Lately it has been cold and I don't know how I feel about that.  I like wearing hoodies but it is supposed to be summer right now.  This is the time of the year when I go to the beach.   I hope it warms up.  Well I have to get going.  Today wasn't a long blog.
