I usually don't do this but latly I have been enjoying this holiday. It's fun...its just a little fake blood, it never hurt anyone. People are jumpy around here, I've just been doing my normal stuff and i get a few jumps here and there.  I guess it looks pretty good becuase i feel like a fucking animal in a cage... people just looking and going, "Hey Mark, check this guy out!" Fuck OFF! Its just a little fake blood, never hurt anyone...
