Hickcentral and Frathouse galore.  The plus side is that I'd probably do a good job and traveling wouldn't be required.  Is advertising something more tangable for me?  I would get to be creative at some level.  But ethics might be sketchy.  But I could probably deal with it if I was in LA.  A friend advised in an email that I should just move to LA and find a job when out there.  It's tempting but considering I don't ever deal well with change and uncertainty, it probably won't happen.  Though I would at least have an assemblance of a network of friends in LA with a certain Sliozi.  Sad to say that after 4 years of school, I have two or three aquatances and I haven't hung out with anyone in the three weeks I've spent down here over the summer.  But the question comes down to whether I continue to repeat past mistakes and pass on the sure thing in front of me or wait hoping something else will come up.  I'm leaning towards being conservative and telling myself that in three years I can go anywhere I want.  I half believe it.  Cause by then I'll probably be tied down and unable to move to Cali, learn to surf and find an awesome lady.  But for tonight I won't take any drugs and make a clear headed attempt at a test tomorrow that is possibly one of the most important ones I have taken in my life...Sweet dreams
