In David's bedroom, in David's kitchen, in David's livingroom, in David's kitchen again in David's bedroom again, at the top of David's stairs, and in David's bedroom AGAIN. Oh and on David's stairs, then on David's stairs, then on David's stairs and in David's porch x5.  Can you tell i had a good afternoon?!
