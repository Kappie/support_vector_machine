AHHHHHHHHHHHH!  ok thank you.  oh and L made this terrific post tonight bout how she feels bout dating.  its excellent.. she put what i think into like perfect words.  course i didnt always think that way... but after 2 relationships that ended with me gettin hurt i've learned to look at dating a different way.  L's way.  its so much easier.  anyways... off to bed now i guess.  have a nice night.  sleep tight kids.
