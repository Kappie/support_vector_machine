As if it was yesterday.I wonder how my life would have been if i had gone to JC. Total mess and stress,I guess. The sight of my JC frens really struggling to cope with the amount of pressure. I pity them. Why go through all the pain of studying GP,maths,chem and so on. I am glad I am in the poly. Life is not so stressful.  A new chapter in my life is about to begin. Wish me luck in my love life. ALL THE BEST IN WHATEVER I DO. DO NOT RUSH. THINK STRAIGHT AND I GOT A CHANCE.
