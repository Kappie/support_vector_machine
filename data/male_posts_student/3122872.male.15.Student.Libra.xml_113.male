Also, I'm sorry for stealing your signatures, I'll do different random song lyrics instead.  2) Does anyone know what our DoE projects are on? She didn't exactly inform us well!  3) James, "She's 2!" is a perfectly good excuse, in the same way blondes can go "I'm blonde!" and get away with bloody murder. Oh and have you read the prequel to "The Da Vinci Code"? You should, it's a good book.  4) I don't look 16 really, do I Jamie? I'm not going to lie on a job application form, and I don't have, as Conor put it, "the Asians" to help me by not caring. Thought about that, eh Jamie?  That seems to be my random rage over. Not gonna be here tomorrow afternoon, so don't get mad if no post (alright James?)  Simon - If you tolerate this your children will be next (Manic Street Preachers)
