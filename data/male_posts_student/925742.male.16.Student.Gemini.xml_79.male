I planned to go with Kyle V, but plans got shot when I was told I couldn't go.  I had my permission slip in, and last night my dad just said he couldn't let me go with my friends.  Doesn't trust us teenage drivers, probably.  I don't blame him; we were gonna travel by interstate.  So I spent today at home playing videogames... for several hours no less.  Current PC Game(s): Case Closed (add-on for Half-Life, and best use of barnacles EVER) and Penultima ReRolled 4: Pastor of Muppets (mod for Neverwinter Nights) Current PPC Game(s): Quake, and Snails (argueably the best tactical snail-based shooter of all time)  Current Mood:  Anxious.  Anxious as in eager.  Eager to break more maxes in weightlifting tomorrow. Only on week 5 and I'm already on par with the older lifters of my class. Current Music: Move Bitch - Ludacris/Feat. Mystikal  Well, I'm out.
