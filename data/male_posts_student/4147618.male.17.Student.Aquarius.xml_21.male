Couple of things I've been thinking lately, and thought I would share:  1) I don't know about any other parents-to-be, but Sami  I are already madly in love with the baby. Every little move, every little kick is special. So much care and love goes in, even BEFORE the baby is born. Now one would think that our parents went through the same things when we were in the womb. Now that we are all grown up, we sometimes get mad or say mean things to them, without realizing the amount of care and love that went into us as babies and teenagers. I guess it the circle of life...takes a parent to know a parent. I don't even know our baby personally , but I know if she got mad at me, it would hurt my feelings. Live  Learn I guess....Live  Learn.  2) Gift Registries..... that concept apparently eludes the Indian community. The fact that someone would tell you exactly what they want to receive as gifts is apparently mind boggling. They still like to keep the element of surprise in giving gifts (not in a good way, I might add). Obviously, what do WE know about what WE want, they know us WAY better than that. I think they should put that power to good use, cause god knows the world can use some good mind readers right about now. It's not even about the money.... I mean we have gifts registered all the way from $9.99 to $199.99. A $9.99 bib set would do us a lot more good then ....let's say..A photo frame ??? Well ...A lot more to say on that subject.. but you get the drift.  Well...more later...  *edit*  Noticed something during lunch time. Walking with a pregnant woman changes the way people look at you. Everyone is nice to you all of a sudden. That's strange... but I'm taking Sami everywhere I go from now on :-)  *edit2*  3) Would having a kid  be more like playing god or guardian?  You give life, you shape life, and then you watch the results.  If you think about it....ever single one of us gets to play god in our lifetimes.  So I wonder, why do we worship something that we ourselves possess the power to do?  We can Give Life (Birth) We can Shape Life (Raise Kids) We can Take Life (Kill) We have the determination and skills to even perform miracles. (child birth, space travel, self healing)  So why dont we take the energy we put into praying and use it to better ourselves.  Make ourselves better parents, better educators, better protectors, better scientists.  I dont know why...maybe someone can enlighten me.  I am not saying that god doesnt exist...I dont want to touch that subject :-)
