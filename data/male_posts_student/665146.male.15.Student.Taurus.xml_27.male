Anyway, today I went to the Marin County Fair, and now, I introduce my GUIDE TO CARNIE FOLK!!!!!  First off: Newbie carnie:  More often selling than gaming, younger, no evident personality.  Running into these people wouldn't make a difference.  If you can tell they're trying to act like a carnie with experience, forget them, just get your crap and walk away.  Expert carnie:  These carnies can be anyone.  They have no universal style, but they are masters of their station and they will show off what they can do as if to say, "Anyone can do it...” If young or cute enough you can get something for free from them, just beware of getting suckered into paying $20 for some crap.  Death before dishonor.  Drunk-novice carnie:  Low experience + high alcohol intake = oh my god, she's dead...  These folk are trying to keep awake and entertained through the whole time they're there.  Tired of hearing all the same old crap, they long for an escape....  Too many cops there, so they go for the Budweiser truck...  When at demonstrations, avoid them, but if you get them at games, take advantage of them.  If there's only one of them, you can easily lie about what happened.  However, let it be known, that all drunk-novice carnies become experts, so just think of every one of them as the "ugly little duckling"...  Drunk-experts:  Pretty much the same as above, just not as easy to trick.  They can be a bit meaner and have a heavier slurred voice........  Brain-dead "technicians":  These folk operate the rides.  They're tired of strapping people in for the ride and pushing the same buttons, so they long for anything different. Just don't give it to them or it'll get worse.  You don't need to talk to them for any reason, so just enjoy the ride.  Food vendors:  Usually the nicest folk around.  As far as I have known, they barely ever get drunk because they'll always have food to sop-up the booze.  Enjoy these folk, they have a certain power over all other folk and consumers.  Probably because they handle everything you eat, they can easily screw up and give you food poisoning.  Cheers.  Ticket holders:  Screw it, these people aren't worth the print.  All I'm going to say is that these people don't give half a shit what you have on you.  They're supposed to search you for suspicious objects, but if you blend in and look them in the eyes, you can get by.  More to add later......   Go America........ This country brought to you by carnies: The fabric of our lives.......
