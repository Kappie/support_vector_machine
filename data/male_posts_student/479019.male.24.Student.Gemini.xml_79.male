WWE Confidential was a cool show last night. Mean Gene rules! Oh yea... Trish and Lita look horrible without makeup. I also hung out with my good friend Jose Cuervo.  I'm going to shower, eat, and go return that blue hair gel stuff. I don't like how it's all flakey. Then it's  Hives  later tonight! That's gonna rock!  ***
