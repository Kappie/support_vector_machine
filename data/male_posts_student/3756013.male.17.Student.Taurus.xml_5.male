Well, when I was walking up to him with the leash...he ran...so I had to chase him down. After I finally got the leash on the damn dog I had to put him in the car (so I thought) when opening the door to get him in the car he got real freaked out and started to run...well I had the leash on him so he couldn't get to far. I grab his collar to pull him to the car...then the damn dog bites me gets his head out of the collar and runs under the house! Needless to say he missed his appointment.  Then just a few min. Ago my dear sweet Dolores called me...boy that went real well...Past few days she has been giving me an attitude...saying I haven't been "the same"...bullshit...She's the damn one giving me the damn attitude...I'm trying to have a nice convo with her but no...she wants to be sarcastic and ignore me...bleh...I hate this shit...I can see that this week is going to go to hell...Its already gotten off to a bad start. O well, maybe it will get better...I can only hope...I'm out...talk to yall later
