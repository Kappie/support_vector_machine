Im not sure what it was that made these tests so difficult, maybe it was my general apathy towards the test, maybe it was mjjisdirected instructin, maybe it was a siren gamecube begging me to finish quickly.  In any case, this may very well screw over any attempt for me to further my education after highscool, but for now, i'm not worried about it.  The Guild Wars demo is out, and fair game for any of you that want to try it.  I wasnt a big fan, there is a team quest function that was oddly un-team like.  I went on a few quests and on each one there was no real sense of "teamwork," just individual players hacking and slashing.  I still have the chem test to finish up, and Mrs. Vaughn can't wait till summer, things are pulling my attention away, adieu.
