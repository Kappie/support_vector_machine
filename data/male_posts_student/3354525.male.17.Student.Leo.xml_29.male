What if you could make it so that times weren’t tough?  So every morning when the world woke up  There’d only be weather on the news  And what if you were back in bed  With one of them floating over your head  What do you say to your enemies  When you don’t know what it is that could have been between you?  There ain’t no blue skies over bad lands  Even if it ain’t raining in the mornings  But you don’t need to fly to understand it  Just understand understanding  Written by Matthew Good
