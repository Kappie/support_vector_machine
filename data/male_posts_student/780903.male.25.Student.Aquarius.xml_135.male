The reason why I point this out is that I read something about it somewhere this afternoon ( urlLink www.tvtattle.com ) saying that it seems like it was originally written to be aired after Reagan dies (it's all in the past tense), but since he hasn't died yet they figured they'd air it anyway.  If I watch, I may be able to singlehandedly lower the average age of the viewers by a few years.
