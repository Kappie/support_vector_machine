Once again the band finds itself ready to compete against approximately 160 other local acts in this year's Battle of the Bands.  I've always been torn about these things. On one hand I ask myself "Why would any band want to compete against another band? What is there to prove?" On the other hand I say to myself "Because you dipshit. There is $10,000 at stake, a touring van, and a whole lot of FUCK YOU's to be said to the other bands if you win." Of course the "Fuck You!" part is barring you aren't a band we like. There are only a few so chances are your not one of them. Sorry. Our band has always struggled with promotion. I don't mean flyering around town, I mean sucking up to the appropriate figure heads. We just don't do it. I'm sure we come across as dicks because of it, but I swear that's not the case. Well, maybe that's not entirely true.  If you are in a band you are in a band because: A. You like the music you play. B. You want as many people as possible to hear the music that you love (punk rock in our case). C. You want to make money at what you are doing. Don't give me this "It's punk rock motherfucker!" You need the money. Whether it is to buy alcohol, crack, heroine or to feed the baby you just had with your 17 year old girlfriend. You do it because you hope someday you'll be making money from it. There is NOTHING wrong with that. Just make sure that's not the only reason you're doing it.  It can be argued, and it's generally agreed on, that if one wants to make it "big" he'she has to be a salesman of their product. i.e. music. But, there are limits to what our band will do in order to get people to hear our shit. I REFUSE to walk up to any journalists, introduce myself and tell him/her how great I think his columns are. Nope, not gonna do it. I WILL however hand them a demo or invite them to a show. If they come, great. If not, I'll try it a couple more times. It doesn't take much to realize when a journalist gives a flying fuck about your band or not. If they don't show up after two or three show offers than chances are they won't show up at all. Wait, that's not entirely true. Some journalists will get off their lazy asses if you bug the shit out of them enough. So forget what I just said, and bug the fuck out of every journalist you come across.  Anyway, sucking up isn't in our repetoire (sp?). I do now of some people around town that have no problem doing it, and the bands they promote are usually the ones who get the most press. That's why we rely on our on-stage "Fuck you, what you see is what you get" attitude. We rely on the 20 to 25 minute blitzkrieg set filled with energy. We cannot allow the crowd enough time to think or else they'll come to the conclusion that "Hey, this band really doesn't give a fuck what I like!" When the audience has time to think or process what we just said (Or lack thereof in our case) it's bad news for us. Let them think AFTER the show, not during. Hit 'em hard and keep hitting them hard for a good 20 to 25 minutes non-stop. Many people will argue this point but they are wrong. Always, I repeat, ALWAYS leave the crowd wanting more. I don't care how good of a band you are. You are LOCAL and people will probably get bored with you after about 15 minutes of the same crap over and over. Unless your pulling monkees out of your ass (And yes, I spelled it M O N K E E S because you'll have to pull Mickey fucking Dolenz out of your ass in order to keep the crowds attention for more than 15 minutes) the crowd will start to think about other shit. That's all.
