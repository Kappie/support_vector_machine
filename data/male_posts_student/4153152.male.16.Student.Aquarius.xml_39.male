They looked like they were shop computers too. I was pretty impressed, until I looked under all the crap stacked about and found 4 computers waiting. Same shit, different day.  I've got a couple links here, they are some excellent sites. One is from a soldier currently in Iraq, and the other is from a Vietnam vet. I don't know if I'm just weird, but I find their personal accounts riveting.  urlLink Images of My War-Ulf R. Heller   urlLink My War-Fear and Loathing In Iraq-Anonymous   Those of you that aren't blind will probably have noticed my new design template. I think it looks a good deal sharper, and I just prefer the overall look. If you have any comments,  urlLink email them to me .
