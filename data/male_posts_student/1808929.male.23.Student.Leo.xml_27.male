As I arrived the airport was pretty quiet, but as the sunlight started to gleam through the windows of gate C15 the amount of activity blossomed. I twisted and turned in my terminal gate chair unable to return to sleep. I peaked at my cell phone watch over and over again; it seemed as if boarding time would never come.      After about 7 cycles of CNN news I finally was allowed to board the plane. On the plane I could fall fast sleep, but only if I tried to read a recent JAMA article. The flight was uneventful, but as we descended to the RDU area I could see again the familiar tall treetops that always masked the horizon to the road traveler. Evergreens and bare deciduous arbors are everywhere.       While I’m in baggage claim I get a call from Melanie Michel, a friend from TCOM. We quickly catch up with either other’s respective spring break adventures. Mel offers her sympathies regarding the recent Duke loss to Maryland, and I thank her for the gesture. Yeah, Duke really sucked it up big time, yet somehow still maintains a #1 seed.       Mel and I conclude our conversation as I find my last piece of luggage. Outside as I wait for a ride I spot my first Duke contact. John Barrows was a Pegram resident of mine two years ago. He’s now a junior pre-med, and oh how I sympathize with the junior premed. Life is hell in that stage of life, isn’t it? John and I are both waiting for our rides for about 15 minutes. John eventually sees his ride and bids adieu to me. Moments later, Scott Atkinson shows up in his new Passatt. He hasn’t really changed much that I can tell. When I talk with him I realize what things have changed. He’s much more mellow. A year of carrying heavy Internal Coordinator burdens has brought him to a point where he must pick his battles carefully. The little things no longer concern him. With law school choices abound, he is looking forward to graduating and moving on to the next phase of his life.       Scott takes me all the way back to Duke’s campus, where there are all sorts of obvious physical changes that have happened over the year. Where else would I visit first upon arriving to Duke than the DUEMS office. In there I find Jared, Marshall, and Dyson. It’s really begun; I’m back at Duke and I’m seeing these people all over again. A number of things catch my eye first: the new office arrangement, the new squad uniforms, and yet another new computer. As we begin our hellos I suddenly feel welcomed. I wear no nametag; I am no second-class citizen; I am accepted, recognized, and appreciated all over again. More and more people arrive throughout the day at this seeming Grand Central Station. Most of the faces are familiar, but many are new, and some just downright confused me (the Jones twins have since exchanged each other’s hair style).       Without warning I walk into a newly refurbished Student Activities Office so that I might surprise Angie Thornburg. A quick “oh my gosh” sets the stage for another reunion hug. Angie is looking great and her day is fairly busy, but she skips a few phone calls for me so that we might have some time to catch up. We talk about her daughter turning 16, her search for a new house, and Jake Woods’s gossip. Angie was one of those women whom I was pretty conversant with day after day. She makes the Student Activities Office a fun place to be.       The sky eventually greyed so that it might rain at any time. I rushed to the biology building in a whimsical attempt to find Dahl Clark. Remarkably I find her in Bio 046. Her hair is shorter, neater, and her clothes look newer. In a complete academic role reversal she tells me that she’s switching back to physics after biology had rubbed her the wrong way over the years. She is on her way to teach her biology lab class so I leave her pressed for time.       David Strauss takes me over to the EMT-B class. On our way we talk about the successes and frustrations with the EMT class. Dave took on the heavy load of the EMT class last year, but since then he began to try and replace Kim and Barb. I told him that I regretting having left the EMT class situation on such unsure footing. I worked so hard to try to make the class a mainstay and an institution within our squad…their squad.       Barbara Jackson was one of my EMT instructors back in the summer of 2000, and she’s still teaching it. She had a pretty genuine smile on her face the whole time I was visiting with her, but I had to wonder what was really going through her mind      On the phone Sunny Wang was energetic and funny. One of my past crew chiefs, she is now a first year student (like myself) at Duke Med (unlike myself). We were making plans to meet on Wednesday for dinner.      Jake Woods is still Jake Woods. On the phone he was willing to drop everything he was working on just to talk to me. He’s got this new online startup project that he told me about, something like an online personal trainer. It sounds like a pretty extensive venture; he got the idea after talking business with his own personal trainer.      Steve and Jared have their own plans worked out for the future. Both will have their EMT-I by this fall and plan to be working for Durham County EMS. Steve, who will be taking this next year before entering medical school, will be living with Jared in a nearby apartment starting this summer. Steve has been quite nice and hospitable. He’s housing me for two nights of my stay. Like many other seniors he’s biding his time ‘till graduation. The MCI drill, the rugby tournament, and any possible NCAA basketball bonfire staffing will be all she wrote for Barmach before he moves on to bigger and better things. Jared, a junior, is tired of Duke. A crew chief now, he doesn’t seem to have the same zeal for training that I remember having. He’s frustrated by an intense bureaucratic structure that is choking him. Duke EMS has taken him only so far. He needs to be challenged in new ways, and I hope that working for Durham County will be that new challenge he needs. Steve, Jared, and I stood for long time outside the West Union arch discussing these important life choices and other squad issues that have recently come up. A night-time rain begins slowly and at this point and I am once again amazed at how beautiful this campus really is. I took so much for granted.       As the rain starts to fall, I make my way over to Brownstone with Scott. As I arrive I immediately see Julie, the “EMS groupie” and one of Suel’s good friends whom I’ve come to know over the years. I was very happy to see Sue-Ellen again. She seems more vital and lively than I remember seeing her last. Ah, thinking of those days when we were very good friends. Somehow our dedication to the squad warped our relationship seemingly beyond repair, but once again time heals wounds and we can once again laugh about all those stupid things. Pam, Sarah, Trey and other Brownstone people I know come to say hello again; I begin to feel the symptoms of social anxiety disorder (that I self-diagnosed) return as everyone’s eyes are focused on my face…and my new facial hair, which seems to be getting mixed reviews.       I eventually settle down on east campus after 1 a.m. in Steve’s room. Before going to sleep Steve asks me what I think of the squad so far. That’s certainly a big question and at first I don’t know what to say. Everything I’ve seen thus far is mainly superficial; perhaps I’ll know more before I leave. But finally I tell Steve that I’m not here to judge or critique. I have my own life now away from all this. My hope is that all the graduating seniors can look back on their EMS experience in a positive light. If my visit can help some people put things in perspective then the trip’s been worth a dern to me. All the while I think of Jen and her fall resignation. I’m confused by it all and wish it didn’t happen the way it did.       It’s been one long day and I began to rapidly tire. My next few days would be booked, but I don’t think about that as I drifted off. This stuff is so much fun. I realize once again why it meant so much to me. Actually, I don’t. It’s an intangible sort of intense passion that I now associate with Duke EMS. Now in medical school, I hope to develop that same passion for …something, just something that might give me the same sort of direction and personal satisfaction.
