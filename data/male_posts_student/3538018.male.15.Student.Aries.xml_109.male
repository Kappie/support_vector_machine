Summer band is now up and going (for almost a week now) and it feels like school has already started because we are up there from 8-4!!!!! UGH! I feel like when I get home I need to sit down and do homework. Thats how much it feels like we are in school right now. So yeah, subject of summer band. Many words can describe...tiring, repetitive, some of it useless? yes uhhh what else...wow there is a lot. I mean it is nice to be with the horn section again and with friends but I mean the band part this week has kinda sucked. I cant really play my instrument because my mouth is really messed up (not just cause my lips are out of shape) and the show music is incredibly fast and the horn part is pretty damn hard. I mean its fun dont get me wrong, and we have a lot of the melody which is cool, but its hard. A lot of work will need to be done to pull this year off successful and I mean A LOT! Not just with the horns, everybody....I mean weve spent two fricking days learning 8 steps of forward march and we arent even up to temp!....totally new marching stuff wow, just a lot of work....gah!  So yeah along with band starting up hockey has also started up in full swing too...anywhere from 2-4 times a week on the ice, at the rink...plus my regular work out that I need to do to get my body back in shape from summer....i wish i had done more now to keep my body inshape because I can really feel it, like really feel it. So yeah thats whats up with hockey. Oh and fyi, let me know if you want e-mails this year about games. I know a lot of yall started to come out last year and apparently had fun so yeah...just let me know.  So lets see what ive done since Ive gotten home from vernon....chilled with friends all last week, cleaned my room of all my junk (and did it in one day!), thats about it...I mean nothing really else to do but hang out with friends on your LAST week of summer in the middle of JULY!! UGH! sorry, I just hate the fact that my summer is getting stolen away from me...but I guess I knew it was coming, just choose to ignore it.  This years scheldule is looking totally killer on me. I thought last year was bad but no, this year is by far way more busy. State year for band which means a couple more weekends, couple extra contests and makes things a heck of a lot more busy and hard. I mean it may not seem like it, but it is. Also hockey coach is talking about playing AAA tier two which is a higher level and means more commetment, practices, blah blah blah....and lets not forget the high school team. That too. And lets also not forget my school classses...all pre-ap except algebra two (NO PISKORZ!!!!!) But still...4 pre-AP...so yeah insane year...should be fun though. I know it may seem like im complaing but for the most part I am looking forward to all this stuff.  So yeah, this friday is the band picnic which I am also looking forward to because yeah...I just like it. In my opinion the best band event of the year (although florida might outdo band picnic this year lol) So yeah really looking forward to that...and thats about all thats going on the rest of this week except more 8-4 summer band!! YIPPEEE!!!!!....not lol...alright well tonight is looking good, hanging out with Meeta =) and maybe some other people...im out.
