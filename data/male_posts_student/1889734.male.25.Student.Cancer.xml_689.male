The game was at 9 pm last night, playing the team that we beat in the first game of the season (12-10 I think…something like that).  They showed up with a full roster, while we had three people (and one of them was the woman on our team who runs the league.  She’s a solid player, but due to gender, isn’t as fast or physical as most of the players).  We borrowed a skater from the game before ours, giving us the minimum number of people for the game.  Ever optimistic, I pointed out that we now had the advantage, since it was impossible for us to be called for too many men on the surface…one less penalty for us to be concerned about.  We ended up losing 6-4, but I was so thrilled with my own performance.  It was a Zen game for me, where the puck looked like a beach ball and everything seemed to be in slow motion.  I was making miracle glove saves on one timers, terrific stack pad slides, and in one case, batted the puck out of the air while diving across the empty net…picked it clean out of the air like I was taking batting practice.    On the down side I took a savage spear to the neck (it was accidental – a collision on a two-on-one break).  The blade of the stick barely caught my mask, but the heel did hit my neck.  The falling player ended up driving his full weight behind the stick, and for a moment I thought I was going to impersonate a dandelion under the tender care of a six year old.  Fortunately the mask took most of it.  Another inch or two…  I rarely feel so positive about a lost game, but I’m still experiencing the warm glow of satisfaction.  It is rewarding to skate the post game handshake and see a proper amount of respect and awe from the other team, as well as the conversation afterward while everyone breaks down their equipment.    It was a great night.  I’m playing again tonight for the women’s league as a stand in.  With my luck, I’ll probably give up 10.
