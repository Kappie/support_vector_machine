I am going to change the title style (so it will look different as of this post) and I am going to use my new found knowledge (shut up Eh, Steve, I know you know more) of CSS. I am so bored right now. I also need someone's help, most likely Eh, Steve's to change the format around. The format looks okay when viewed from a PC but it is not Mac compliant yet and I am surprised he puts up with it.   I have a "Site o' the day"! It is actually the project I just finished for this class. Read it, it is pretty funny. All I did was change the font and the colors a little.   Now I am done and I am going to go mess with the CSS on this page.
