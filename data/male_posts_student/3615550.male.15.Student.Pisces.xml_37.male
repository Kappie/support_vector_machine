Am I the only one who is seeing stuff on the sidebar that isn't supposed to be there, or are you guys seeing it too? I checked the template, and everything's in order there. I'm telling you, Blogger is starting bother me. I checked around for a better blog hosting server, but Blogger is the best I can find for free. I'm also loathe to leave this blogging community for some unknown community. I guess I'm stuck with Blog*Spot for now.   Are any of you experiencing problems with your blogs? I also noticed that a link to the TTLB Ecosystem that I added has disappeared. It was there for a while, and it's still on my template, but it has disappeared from my blog.My posts have been taking an unethical amount of time to show up on my blog after I publish them too. I'm starting to get ticked...
