On Wednesday night I found that Peter has been drinking cough medicine by the bottle, behind my back. He had doped up to catch a buzz and watch the Matrix Revolutions. The movie crapped out and at 3am he got dressed to go to the video store and demand a new rental. Well he could not stand up and was stuttering and slurring. ********************************  needless to say I was not pleased and went bezerk. This ignited 2 days of fights and physical altercations between us. Peter HAD been clean and sober for almost 18 months. So much for that. And it was a shock to my mental stability to see  him like this. And to know that he had pissed away his "time" over the cough medicine HIGH. So now he starts over again, and I am living with a newcomer once again. I don't know if I have it in me again. He sleeps as I write and sleeps away most of his day and night.   *******************************  Things are not always as they seem, So I am waiting for divine inspiration here. Its a good thing that Clay and Ryan are coming up next weekend. I can go hang out with Clay and Ryan can babysat Peter while I get out of the house. It's the July 4th Holiday in the States, so Clay and I will have a few days together. That will be great.   ********************************  As for me, I am tired and frustrated with life. I need a break and I need to get out of here, as I have said before. Melbourne sounds like a far enough place to go for a vacation. He he he. I'm not going get that vacation from life yet. Peter is going to New York for 3 days the weekend of the 8th and 9th. So I will have a whole weekend to myself here.   ********************************  I need to get "Laid" yes I do. It has been so long and that is a sticking point with my hubby here. He has put me on the BAN LIST. So I don't get any action here, and that is making me a very bitter man. I want to go out and sow my wild oats, but cheating is not an option. I believe that if you have to go outside a relationship for something, then you don't deserve to be in a relationship. So I eat sour grapes.   ********************************  other than that, classes are over, the exams have been written and turned in. Now I wait for my grades to come out. I've applied for assistance next fall for my classes since I cannot handle the pressure of 12 credit semesters, taking care of Peter and being HIV Positive. I just cannot do it. I will make myself sick and die over the stress. So I get to play my ace card.   ********************************  I've made some wonderful new friends online, and now we belong to a little "cam group" we sit and chat, and like a friend has said, to see expression when we talk is really great. We have a 2  continent chat every day. Very kewl. Well that's all I have for today. See ya...
