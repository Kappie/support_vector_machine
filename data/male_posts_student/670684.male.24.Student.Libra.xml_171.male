I'm lucky in that I can even try...America allows its citizens to forget about the world around them.  For those who believe the US Military to be pristine, turns out a Human Rights Organization is  urlLink concerned about the 84% accuracy of cluster bombs  used in the war effort.  Also, Switzerland, home of the Geneva Convention office that documents POWs and civilian casualties in war times, is going to  urlLink document US and British war crimes .    In something that can only be described as embarassing, Austin isn't only known as the Live Music Capital of the World, but also as the home of  Texas pro-America zealots .  It's funny that at the end of the article the fellow quoted says that he believes the media to be anti-war in scope; I feel it's the complete opposite.  Someday I'll discuss Statistics 101 and how a Yes or No question denies allowance to answer a question honestly, thus upping a certain side that gets the swing votes.  Making a long story short, when 72% of people support war, it doesn't mean that 72% support war; it means that 28% are vehemently against it enough to not fear retribution or social unrest for saying so.    Dan Wearsch, Diana Kolman, and I can tell you that the news is never the truth.  The  urlLink differing accounts of the seven dead civilians at the army checkpoint  should help prove that.  Also, there are differeing opinions on what will happen in post-Saddam Iraq, including reports of  urlLink secret US-backed initiatives to keep control .  Both  urlLink Belgium  and  urlLink Germany  have expressed recent outrage at the US-led war.    George Monbiot of the  urlLink Guardian  gives a  urlLink less-than-stellar prognosis  of what war will do to the Middle East, and to the world.  This war did not have to happen.  At least not like this.
