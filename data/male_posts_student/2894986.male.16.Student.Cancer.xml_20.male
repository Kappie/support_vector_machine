A batch of storms will pop up and come through for a few hours and then move on. But at the same time more storms are forming just out of radar distance. Along with the downpours we have received some hail and right now, our second tornado warning, even though it is for the notrthern part of the county. You gotta love tornado season. It's the time of the year when meterologists butt into to way too much television and cause unneeded mass paranoia. I did get to a tornado hitting Clarksville live on WHAS Sky Cam. The rain has caused its fair share of problems. The Indy 500 was dealayed for 2 hours and as of now is still under a red flag. Not to mention that Valhalla Golf Course is now offically a lake.   (Hour or so break)  Well, I had to quit writing because they issued a tornado warning for our area. About 20 minutes later 2 tornados were spotted in our area. One by the Billtown Rd. exit off the Gene Snyder and one by the Glenmary subdivision. They was terrential rain and large hail in our area but we didn't get either. So we survived. More is headed in tonite. Will if ever stop? I just want to swim.
