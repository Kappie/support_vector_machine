Two, actually. The title of the whole thing is 'Action of the fruit concentrate' One graph is 'Strength test', the other 'Smoothness test'. They both are bar charts showing a left-hand bar on each graph that is shorter than the right hand bar. In both cases the left hand is 'Before' and the right hand 'after'. Here it is if you want to see (bottom of the page). Or go to your supermarket.  http://forums.cozycot.com/cozypurrs/displaybycategory.php?master_id=4   What is wrong with this? How many mistakes can YOU spot? I'll leave a big space, so may actually consider doing it, O Child of Instant Access who never does anything unless there is a direct link to it. Anyway, do it. Now. Yes, now! Stop reading all this stuff, get a pen and paper (or open up a document if you're one of those) and do it.                     Anyway, here are my answers: 1. Before and After what? 2. No scale. Could be upside down, for all I know. 3. What were the tests? 3a. How many times did they repeat the test?  3b. Were the results fair? Was it just asking someone 'Is your hair smoother/stronger now?' and waiting 'til they got someone who said 'yes'? 4. Action of the friut concentrate on what? 5. Strength and Smoothness of what? 6. How do you measure Smoothness?  There are probably more things. If you spot any outstanding ones, or have otherwise been incensed by my Blog, mail them to me, when I give you my E-mail in a bit. I want to check people can't send virurses, and I can delete the post with it in, and stuff. And while I'm on shampoo, the adverts have some glaring problems, too.  1. Often they claim to 'nourish hair'. Hair doesn't need nourishing. It's dead cells. 2. No shampoo currently could reduce knots. 3. One shampoo advert used this technique: 'It's shampoo!! It has NUTRIENTS!!! ['nutrients' flash up, dozens a second, on screen. They are mostly elements.] The one I noticed most was U238 (Uranium 238). Quote, from http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/phy00/phy00108.htm 'Question -   What is Uranium-238 used for? What is the main purpose for Uranium-238?   Since U238 is a stable isotope of uranium, it will not produce energy in a nuclear reactor.  For this we have to have U235, which is unstable.  U238, since it IS stable is the most commonly occuring isotope of uranium when it is dug out of the ground.  So usually to use the uranium in a power plant, the amount of U235 must be increased, run the ore thru a plant and pull out slightly more U238 than U235, leaving an enriched uranium, enough U235 to run the reactor.  We would not want pure U235 in a power plant, this would make it too much like a bomb.  So in this case U238 is "used" to sort of dillute the U235, to make U235 a safe fuel.  In what is called a breeder reactor, U238 can be converted to unstable isotopes, and these then used for fuel.  So in this case U238 would be the starting point for other things, eventually ending up with a fuel for a nuclear power plant.  This is not a common thing these days partly because of concern that it is too easy to keep going to make bomb quality fuel.' etc....  That's all for today, probably. I hope you have learned to be more cynical. Remember, adverts are mostly trying to sell you things. Never buy stuff advertised. Or turn over. Some adverts cost millions of pounds. Think of the fun you can have, destroying something which costs that much, by turning over for two minutes. Plus they can't get at you.
