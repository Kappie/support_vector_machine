She was sitting on a bench eating a donut and drinking a 40oz of beer. The lady must weighed about 250 pounds... How in the hell can a person that is homeless weigh 250 pounds? She obviously has not missed to many meals. If she would cut back on the ding-dongs and malt liquor she might not be homeless.. Our country must be a great place to live if the poorest members of our communities weigh more then an Indian elephant..
