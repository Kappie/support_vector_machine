I just got back from Sean's Party- and although my cell phone got wet (I think it  might  recover) when Jon chucked me into the pool, everything was great.   Better  then great. Everything ruled. I'm so happy, but at the same time I'm   so   pissed off.  This is all because the times that we live in.  Everyone tried to relax, despite the fact that it's summer. We're  all  thinking about fucking school, though.  We're all going back. Sorry to slice the bubble.  This is our junior year.   11th grade.   We're all getting tested. We're all going to try to apply to some schools. We're all going to never see each other again.           Fuck everything.      We're all competing at the one thing that we think is good about us. We're all learning more about music theory, we're all working our asses off running six miles everyday, we're all doing binge drinking and doing horrible acts we regret to try and become a little more creative. All right, maybe that last one is just me.  Maybe.  We all need funding for college.  We need scholarships in sports or worse, disabilities.   If you love me, you'll chop off my hand or sterilize me. Please, I'd do it for you. I'm so pissed off to see all of my friends- all these kids that I love, willingly demolish themselves through physical exhaustion or sucking dick behind a desk for a better grade.   You all are worth so much more than that. You're worth more to our society then you think. We could ALL become doctors or lawyers or poets or musicians, but we're fucking caged running suicides or picking up prep classes in the summer.   Summer was  ours .  It used to be.   I remember being a kid, with Kris, and doing NOTHING all day. We'd go to my Grandma's and swim, or play video games. We had no schudule. I didn't know the fucking day of the week until I got to 7th grade.  I'm still a kid, god damnit. I'M NOT READY.  I still have so much to explore and learn.  Time to grow up? That's  bullshit .  Bullshit created by our government and education system, trying to produce workers faster and smarter then fucking China. We're still in the middle of the cold war. This terrorist stuff is just one big cover-up if you ask me. The red's are only a hop across from San Deigo. I can't wait until they're fucking 1 billion man army starts landing on Malibu Beach and turns all the Hollister into propaganda centers.   That is going to rule so hard.    If any politician doesn't think the same way that I do, then LET US GO. Let us stay in public school for another two or three years.  It couldn't hurt.  But god-forbid if Germany or Japan starts producing better then us, not like they are now, we recede into a depression again.    I'm fucking sick of organized civilization.     This is stupid. I'm bored. Nothing blows up. No drama. Only pain. I only get to see my social group spilt up and sent into the army for college money to do something better with their lives. I really don't feel like going to funerals at twenty-something. Somebody is going to go into the reserves, get called up, and they're head is going to get implode by a mortar shell in some neo-Babylon.  I still get a kick knowing Iraq was Babylon.  Think about it- in a few short years all of us will either be sucking dick in med school, trying to sell the scrap of creativity we have, or in some Masque in the middle east getting our faces owned by sniper bullets.  The future is going to suck.   When did the future switch from being a promise to becoming a threat?   This all blows.  Our school mascot is a Hawk. A noble bird, who has complete freedom.  We're more like the Council Rock South Seeds, if you ask me.  We're not learning how to fly and leaving the nest to go and conquer the world. We're being ejaculated out of a plant in some hell hole west of Manaus.  We can't control where we are going. We're spiraling downward into our progressive future.  This is why we have to cherish nights like tonight.  This is why we should learn all of this now, not in some boot camp for college money.     We're drones.  Drones in a hive.  The queen gives us orders and we follow. Squirm-squirm-dance-dance. This is the same queen who is going to order us our of hexogram cells one day. She's going to send us out into the world to conquer land for the next hive.  To destroy, to flatten, so the bigger and the better can have it.  Guess what? Our entire world is almost developed now. The habiatle parts anyway. We have no where else to go.  For now, though, none of that should concern us. We're together and we're all individuals. That's Jack, that's Amanda, that's Sean, that's Teresa, that's Jill, that's Brad, that's Ryan, that's Eugene & Kris. We're all connected by who we are now, rather then our job description.  We're going to lose all of that. What I want is a way to blast our entire generation free. Blast us free of history and obligation.  I promise all of you, if I somehow do find a method to bring us all back to the stone age where the same tribe stays connected forever- I wouldn't hesitate for a  moment .     I have no problem fucking the world over for a few more good parties.
