And when those abandoned parties unexpectedly reopen communications, it's equal parts shock, relief and guilt.  Can you tell this recently happened to me??  So my advice to all those in this situation: experiencing an unexpected, yet welcome reestablishing of communication with an ex-wife, old friend or long-lost sister, I offer this advice...  (Damn, how do you type a bullet on a Mac?)  1. Be honest.  Did you misrepresent yourself before?  Well, now you've had some extra time to consider who you are.  So show off your your newfound knowledge...be endless in a victory of yourself.  2. Be explicit.  Did you ask her to sleep with you before and she said no?  Fuck it, man.  Ask her again.  You can't hit the apple if you don't fire the arrow.  And if you did hit it on the first try, you're just a damn good archer.  3. Be grateful.  People today don't value one another...stranger, friends and family alike.  So rejoice (in a non-religious fashion) that the abandoned person values you enough to reopen that channel.  That can't possibly be a bad thing!
