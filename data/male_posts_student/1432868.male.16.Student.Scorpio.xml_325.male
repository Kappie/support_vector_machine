I found a clearance sale at Myer-Emco and thought that I would check it out.    well as it turned out their was a nice pair of relatively small Boston Acoustic speakers that were calling to me. Nice sound and small enough to fit as computer speakers. It turned out they were $60. I'm one happy camper...
