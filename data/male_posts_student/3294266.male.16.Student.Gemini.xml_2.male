In recent weeks, however, the spotlight has once again been on his behaviour and loud mouth.  This time he wasn't giving anti-female or anti-Black comments on his radio show, but instead chose to  urlLink name New Zealand Maaori MP Tariana Turia to a "bag of lard"  and shoo off children on a special prime-time screening of a sheep (named Shrek) which made  urlLink CNN World News Headlines .  Lack of non-Iraq-related  urlLink news  aside, we now know  urlLink Paul Holmes  is an anti-Black, anti-female, anti-children and anti-overweight activist. He's probably the most controversial broadcaster in Holland's history, Australia, Britain and Austria didn't keep him and only New Zealanders are stupid enough to purchase his album.  It really makes me think...
