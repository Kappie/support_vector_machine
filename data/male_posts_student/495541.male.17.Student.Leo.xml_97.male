They left for the airport and all that.  It was really nice seeing them for the time they were here.  We didn't get to do much, but just talking to them was great.  Anyways, today my mom and I finished up Christmas shopping.  We got my dad some presents.  I won't say what they are because there's a chance he could be reading this.  I wouldn't want to spoil it, now would I?  Whatever.. yeah so we finished up that and went to Best Buy, Target and Barnes  Noble.  I spent my gift card there on a book by Kevin Mitnick, the computer hacker.  It's called  The Art of Deception .  I've read a few pages of it and it's pretty good so far.  Just the intro was really entertaining.  I think the book will be pretty fun.  Anyways, other than getting that book, I was looking at some MCSE certification books.  I wanted to get one and start in on getting certified.  I know that people who do get certified get big time jobs directly after being certified.  If I start that now, maybe I could get a job and start making the bank.  If not a lot, then at least I could pay for some of my college or something.  Buy a car or something -- just getting ahead financially in life.  I figure I'll do something with computers in my life so there's no sense in waiting until later to get education for it.  I dunno what else... I think I'll just leave it at that.  Have a happy Christmas!
