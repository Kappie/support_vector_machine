Does that mean that i do have inner thoughts which i desire to share yet i'm always hold back for some reasons? blah...blah...blah...i dun wanna sound like a problem kid.   i decide not to scare off my classmates. [STOP RIGHT NOW, thank you very much]  Anyway, many a time, things are getting out of hand. that is why something call "friend" or "assistant" or "partner" are invented. Nus, pls propose to Daniel Wong the national street sale by the end of the coming week. if you wanna me to go with u, do let me know wad time. afterall, i have more FREE period than you do.heehee.
