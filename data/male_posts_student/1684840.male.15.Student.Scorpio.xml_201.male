Everyone is wound up in their own little affairs and hypo attitudes towards the end of school, and some people are beyond excitement and can't wait for the term to come to a dead stop.  We did a cool murder mystery thing period one which didn't turn out to be quite the exciting murder mystery at all.  There were so many stupid clues that didn't mean a thing.  After that we did a funny army thing.  I say funny because the whole experiance was funny, but the work was physically demanding.  Just another bunch of army dimheads acting like they own you.  Loads of people stood up to them it was really funny because no matter how strict they were no-one cared.  We then made a tower out of spaghetti, or tried at least.  Two certan people pissed me off so much.  I really hate being forced to work with people who think they are really and are something that they're not.  They folowed suit in the next activity which was a cool piece of drama which would have been cool had they have evaporated unsuspectedly beforehand.  Dinner was bloody boring.  I hate hanging around 'friends', those especially who are obsessed with shouting and stuff like a seagul (I'm sorry but pidgeon doesn't describe it very well).  Certain people were dancing around and laughing at stupid things and I just think it's really rediculous how people can be jealous of their friend's new other half because they're getting more attention.  Sorry I'm ranting...  The afternoon was a lot better.  The dickheads were sitting out of Task 5 because they can be bothered to come to school and drag themselves, but not do anything - pathetic.  Task 6 was okay I guess.  We were in this toy factory and had to make little paper things and we decided to make truth or dare things.  I made an assortment of sizes and even a tiny baby version which was about 2cd by 2cm.  I'm in a great mood now anyway and just relaxing a bit after a pretty exhausting day at school.
