NWA-TNA has faith in their younger talent. I would love more than anything to see people like AJ Styles, Low-Ki, Christopher Daniels, and The Amazing Red in WWE. If they did come in though, they would probably either be stuck on HeAT/Velocity or sent to the development camp (Ohio Valley Wrestling). Plus NWA-TNA has faith in the talent WWE didn't have. I love the attention that NWA-TNA gives in people like D'Lo Brown, Raven, and K-Kwik (Ron "The Truth" Killings). I really don't think that WWE would have put Raven in the main event scene since they believe he doesn't have "drawing power". Bullshit. Raven was one of excess biggest stars. I think if the writing staff wasn't so far up Triple H's ass, they would definitely have a spot for the lower talent. To paraphrase the great Jim Cornette...  I'm The Dork Knight, and that's my opinion.   urlLink       Song of the Moment:   Black Sabbath - War Pigs
