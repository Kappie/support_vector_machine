Is there something amiss? Something is not right somewhere....   Nevertheless, that's a lesson learnt....I will never, never ever repeat such mistakes...if I do...then, it will be an irreversible change to my mindset.. Not too much of days activity...except for the A.Maths Paper 2....I should say that it was much more easier than Paper 1...but to sum up, I still did badly...I didn't know why I can do well for the tests but not for the exam...pretty strange huh....Oh yeah...the social studies course was very interesting indeed...actually, i wanted to share the external teacher with my thoughts on China..but I guess I might spurt rubbish...Tiannemen Square...sounds more Viet to me....well, it was located in China...I could still remember the event...China students wanted to study in America and wanted one thing in their mind. "BUSINESS COURSE!"...that's right!  Actually, much of my knowledge about them was extracted from Readers' Digest..looks like Chinese people are money minded...no, not just the typical Chinese in Singapore, but the Chinese from the rest of the world aren't spared from this fate...  Hmmmm....I am just hoping I can do well for my prelims and O lvl....I don't care whether you called my batch a "guinea pig" batch or whatever shit it is......it's up to us to do well, right?......I wish the best for everyone taking O lvl..! =)
