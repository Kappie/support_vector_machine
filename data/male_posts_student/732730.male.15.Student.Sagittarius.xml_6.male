We went to Smithfield to play them, and Louise had come over to say "hello". She gave me the Grande Royale tour of Smithfield (the bus driver we had really hates that school. He said it breeds trailer trash). Anyway, Smithfield High is more of a hole than my school! I was shocked. But anyway. We sat under a tree and watched the the game talking about stuff, and as I was getting up to leave we had this discussion:   L:  Would you ever go out with me?  A:  Yer, probably. Why? [ I was thinking it was some kind of "noone lones me" thing... ]  L:  Will you go out with me? *silence*  A:  Ummm...  L:  Come onnn! *silence*  L:  I hate you! [ said jokingly ] So yer, I got on the bus without giving her an answer. If I didn't have Kieran I would've said yes, but I do. She's not a bad looking chick, 'n' shes really nice 'n' stuff... Shoulda said yes?
