I did get plenty of time while I was there to just sit and relax, play some games and read some books without all the distractions you get at home. No email, no internet (well, a laptop on a 33k connection, but it was hardly useful), no school or work and so on. I managed to play through quite a bit of  Prince of Persia  and  Broken Sword  on PS2, something I don't really have time for usually. Now I'm back the revision I have to do for this summer's exams becomes more apparent. I keep thinking about uni, but if I don't work hard now I'm not even going to get there.
