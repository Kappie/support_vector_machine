Sunday morning, Mark and I decided to go see a movie, and after some last minute scrambling which I'll leave to him to explain, we ended up sitting the theater for the Passion.  Somehow, my Pretzel Bites seemed inappropriate, but that didn't stop me from consuming them.  I muttered to Mark a question about what trailers are appropriate for this film?  Martin Lawrence?  It seems the studio might have had the same issues, as the film opened with NO trailers, NO ads, NONE of the usual theater stuff.  It just started.  So what did I think?  This is an odd movie.  Your perspective or expectations is the sole determinant of what you get from this movie.  It is a large mirror, held up for you to look at yourself and find what you want.    I came into it as a non-believer, but filled with respect for the importance of the story and what this means to so many.  I don't think you can be considered a genuine thinker if you hold the Christ story with anything other than respect.  Whether or not Jesus was what is claimed, his teachings converted the dominate empire in the day, and established a foundation for 2,000 years of a culture that lifted us all out of darkness.  Without Christ, the Western World would simply not exist in a recognizable way.  So I respect the power of this story, while the divinity of it is still an open issue for me.  Given that, the movie reinforced my respect for the icons and ideas in the Passion.  It is extraordinarily well-made.  The cinematography is beautiful.  Gibson has inserted classical iconographic images that will add to the historical collection of Christ images.  Caviezel was genuine and understated in his performance, given what he had to work with.  His portrayal showed a very human Jesus, making him accessible as a man.    The violence in the film is appropriately brutal.  I still don't understand those that object to it, since it is the very POINT of the entire Passion.  His suffering is what redeems us, so we should see exactly what that entailed.  During the scourging, I remembered someone saying that the brutal torturing of Jesus in the film is akin to voyeurism - that we are watching the indignities and privation of a man, and perhaps that suffering should be a private matter.  The very point of this pain is in the claim that we are all to blame, since it is done on our behalf and for our benefit.  This pain is the very essence of public domain.  It is a difficult film to review.  My respect was confirmed and enhanced.  My emotion was stirred.  I believe all Western's carry a latent Christian within, and that latency was stirred.  From a 'movie critic' perspective, there are minor points that can be argued.  There are technical shots, story telling constructs and symbolisms that can be debated, and that is a useful exercise from that particular perspective.  But to engage in criticism based on those elements alone is unfair when an ultimate judgment is rendered on the movie.  The claims of anti-Semitism are unfounded, unless you carry in your own existing anti-Semitism, or if you carry in a fear that other's are anti-Semitic.  The Jews are portrayed as any other entranced establishment in human history, facing something that is threatening the status quo.  The particular 'bloodlust' of the Jewish rabbinate is not an indication of evil - it illustrates them as a product of their time and the cultural norms of the era.  I honestly didn't see anyone in this film portrayed as 'evil', other than the casual drunken brutality of the Roman garrison troops, which is pandemic to humanity through history.  Judas seemed to have played the part given to him, as did Pilate, and even the rabbinate.  Pilate was particularly portrayed as a man simple doing what men do when faced with tough choices.  He went out of his way to attempt to save Jesus, but not because of love, but because of expediency.  Anything to quell passions and to prevent a riot.  In the end, the crucifixion of Jesus was a problem of administration rather than an ethical concern.  I think that might have been Gibson's point in the film.  Everyone involved simply did what people do everyday throughout history.  And that is exactly what led to the crucifixion.  Only be acting 'inhuman', by stepping outside of our petty programming, can we prevent the need for the Sacrifice.    If you show up at the theater with contempt for the story, you'll have a cynical, pointless experience.  If you show up as a believer, then this will be an Experience for you.  But there is something else that bothers me.  I believe that those with the strongest of faiths, who truly embrace the ideas of Christ, may not have the 'Experience' in viewing this film.  To those who have true, rock solid faith, the brutality and pain of the sacrifice is sufficiently real to them.  They already understand what it all means, and I don't think they will get the gut-level reaction.  The vast multitudes of people perhaps cling too tightly to their faith out of fear it may slip through their grasp.  These are the people who may be pummeled and shocked by what they see.  These are the people who only have the painted images of the halo-endowed Christ: tall, thin, attractive and smiling.  They may not have a true understanding of the crucifixion outside of the static carving of the wooden Jesus on the wooden Cross.    And again, that might be Gibson's point as well.  Those most shocked and impacted may not have a complete understanding of what they've embraced.  Like someone who joins the military and is then shocked to find themselves in a war.  To BE a Christian requires more than lip service.  It requires more than platitudes.  It requires living the idea, and understanding the price of your belief.  It means understanding the price that was paid to purchase the covenant with God.  And I believe most do NOT truly understand it on a visceral level.  I recommend seeing the film, but take some time and figure out who and what you are before you go in.  Understand what you are looking for, because you'll find it, no matter what it is.
