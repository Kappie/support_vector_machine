When we continue to patronize such mediocre films , why do we then expect to compete with the Global cinema ?                                              There is nothing wrong with commercial Cinema . But Steven Spielberg never got an Oscar for his commercial ventures like Jaws or E.T , he got an Oscar only for his classic "Schindler's List " . I fail to understand why the Jury fails to differentiate between commercial success  meaningful cinema . A 1000 Crore investment Industry , Bollywood ought to churn out more Quality for the money invested.
