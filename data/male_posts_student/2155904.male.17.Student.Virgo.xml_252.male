Tyke went in expecting it to be very much of a hassle and something he really hated going to.  He had a pretty good counselor though, Martin, and he enjoyed some of the things he did.  Along with Tyke were a couple members of this blog, Frederique and Triple Threat.  Those three and two other Issy grads were all there at the same time so they hung out.  The first night was kinda sucky cuz Tyke didn't know where anyone was and his roommate wasn't much fun for Tyke so he just sat alone in the room reading the WSU Catalog and hoping he would get rid of a headache he had.  That was when he realized that he was very much going to miss his friends here.  One person came to mind on a few occasions that night.  He finally went to sleep and the heat wasn't too bad and his roommate wasn't a hassle either.  His roommate was actually one of 3 guys in his group that he didn't actually dislike.  Actually, maybe 4.  But none of them did he like persay.  Just wasn't opposed to.  One guy explained that he was homophobic and the other guy talked about "fairies" and how a gay guy came on to him, which Tyke heartily doubts, and other comments that immediately made Tyke think he was closed-minded and thus a bit of a douchebag.  Tyke has no problem with people until they show they have a problem.  Then Tyke can have a problem with them.  Well for the most part Tyke did not like any of the guys at WSU other than the ones he knew and the actual counselors there were nice guys.  The girls weren't bad.  There were quite a few pretty girls and Tyke knew there was nothing wrong with trying to talk to them and make a friend but as usual he got shot down there.  One girl in his group, who is actually from Sammamish and was born in Overlake Hospital and went to Europe this summer all the same as Tyke, Tyke put most of his focus on.  She was really pretty and had this something about her that Tyke really liked.  So Tyke rolled out all the stops for her and did everything he could to show her what kind of a guy Tyke was.  Well Tyke didn't have  Kinker ending to that one.  She never initiated any topics of conversation with Tyke, nor did she really respond to any of Tyke's talks with anything that showed she had any interest in talking to Tyke ever again.  It wasn't like she visibly hated Tyke but she just didn't care about him.  That was a little disheartening as Tyke was proud of himself for taking the initiative and really trying to talk to someone but she didn't care.  Basically Tyke didn't talk to any of his group mates.  All of them party, Tyke does not, and they weren't exactly in the same intellect as Tyke it seemed.  One guy Tyke thinks really worked hard to get to WSU and has gotten scholarships he desperately needs so Tyke really respects him because Tyke is not even close to that dedicated.  People like that make Tyke feel good.  Even if it means that it shows that Tyke is taking for granted his intelligence and abilities and really not applying himself yet.  But he will have to do that soon in order to get to where he wants in life.  On a funnier note Tyke saw Paris Hilton at Alive.  In fact, she was in his group.  Frederique and Trip T can attest to that fact.  This girl was so very much PH (prounounced phhhhhhh Tyke and Frederique decided).  She looked like her, tall and skinny with blonde hair and a strong tan.  She also talked just like her.  It was freaky at first.  She also acted like her in some ways.  She loooooves to party she says but also is a really nice girl.  She doesn't have a little dog though.  Tyke saw two other look-a-likes at WSU but not ones that blog readers would know by a blog name.  It was really funny to see Paris.  Tyke talked to her some and she also showed no interest in talking to him much but Tyke had given up on trying to make a friend by the time they really started to talk.  Tyke talked a lot with Freddy and Trip T though.  It's gonna be cool hanging out with them next year.  Tyke is already gonna be staying the night in Freddy's room sometime next year.  Probably with Kinker or Trip T.  So it's gonna be fun keeping in touch with the Indians.  Hopefully they do keep in touch and don't drift away.  Tyke really isn't too excited right now about meeting so many new people right now just because he really doesn't think that Tyke fits in with most of them.  He isn't against drinking and that stuff but he certainly doesn't drink now.  And really he has no interest in doing so.  So far Tyke has pretty much only met people who want to party.  Another reason that Tyke is not a big fan of most of the guys is just cuz they aren't as focused as Tyke right now.  This is weird but Tyke might be able to focus on studies for once in college.  Or at least at the start.  He will have a lot of friends going there probably but who knows.  It will all be figured out in 19 days when Tyke actually leaves for the East side of the state.  Not a time that Tyke is anxiously awaiting.  Not really at all.  Summer has been far too short.  It was fun getting Tyke's schedule though.  He has a very full Wednesday, 4 classes.  But his Monday has only 2 classes and Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday only have 3.  He also has 2 classes that should be easy for him.  Chem 101, cuz he has basically already taken that class in high school and he did well in it.  And Span 102, cuz Tyke thinks he has retained Spanish pretty well and this is also the equivalent of Spanish 2 while Tyke has taken 3 years so he should be ahead of most people.  So that makes his schedule easier on that busy Wednesday.  His earliest class is 10:10 and his last one starts at 3:10 and that is a chem lab which shouldn't be too bad.  Overall Tyke isn't too displeased with his schedule.  In fact it's pretty decent.  He couldn't get Com 101 because it was full but it turned out it wasn't full so he could right now get into that but in order to do that he's going to have to switch his schedule up.  That class starts at 9:10 too.  So it would be early.  It is the only class that directly applies to his major but the other ones he is taking because he needs them to graduate, let alone be certified.  So it will all work out.  He can still change his classes whenever he wants right now.  It is all online anyway.  Hmmm...what else?  Oh yeah, Tyke's dad tried to see if he could get Tyke switched into the dorm he put as his first choice especially cuz it's close to all the classes he is in, most notably the Communications building.  He had some relative success.  It is still less than a 50% chance Tyke will get in there but he can and after seeing Stephenson's dorms he wouldn't mind going to a different one.  The dorm room was quite small.  Quite.  And Tyke is one room away from having the corner room which is infinitely times bigger.  It's just huge.  Well other than that, the food wasn't all that bad Tyke thought and the walking wasn't a problem.  It's hilly but Tyke has some pretty good legs so he's cool with it.  He'll like getting the exercise anyway.  But he is thinking he might gain some weight in college.  Sure most students do, hence the Freshman 15, but Tyke actually will eat if he has food available to him most of the time so if he can eat he will.  He just gets full kinda quickly.  But enough of that.  Tyke is gonna play with his laptop more cuz he hasn't in days.  He now can play poker too.  Yee-haw!
