It was too late for him to turn back now, he had already strayed too far from home. He must hope the path he has taken will lead to a better end, and not one forever cold.  Stephen Merity, 7:27   That's generally how I feel at the moment. I just hope I haven't taken too many wrong choices so far, and that the hopes I lean on do not fall =) I'm pretty sure all hopes will hold, and if not, there will always be other things to grab before I fall!  I think I'm generally feeling like this because of two things. CG, computer graphics, output of the imagination, and something not going too well at the moment ;) And I have a crush on a girl... Girl girl girl... Geez lol... (notice the alliteration, repeated use of the letter g... right... too much English work at school =P) I'm not actually going to say who it is online, no knowing what kind of prying eyes see this (not general people, just possibly friends from school) but seeming that I don't think I've gotten any views I should be perfectly fine ;) Anyway, I barely know the girl, so yes, I'm attracted to her from the shallowness of my heart *sigh* But I'm hoping she has a smart spark, as she takes a quite difficult language at school, and mainly I guess it's just hope though... I haven't asked her out yet for a myriad of reasons -   Obviously shyness, grand characteristic =) - I'm not sure it'll work out, we're kind of different social groups - I'm not even sure if I want a relationship - Freaked she will say no (but of course, typical fear =) The last two girls I dated were quite a different matter. The first one I asked cuz my friend spilled on who I liked, and thought it would be better to straight out ask her than tip-toe around the whole issue, and the second asked me out, lots of work on my part =P) My self esteem on this subject is not the highest ;)  *babble babble babble*  Yeah... *phew* Girls *eek* =P (not eek in a " shes got girl-germs! " way, but in a " oh! I wanna ask her out but chances are a million to one, and then it isn't "Lived happily ever after" but more probably "Lasted two weeks before beginning a shout match at each other, then broke up in an explosive display that would make New Years Fireworks look like a set of sparklers"... darn " kind of way... Long explanation huh? =P)   Creativity  Well, today I'm going to start off with a word, go through a random picture archive on my computer, mix my thoughts with that and see how far that gets me =) Ready? =P    vade mecum  - A useful thing that one regularly carries about.  This reminds me so much of my sketchbook, it goes  everywhere  with me and is always on the verge of falling apart! =)  Okay. A guy in a gaol, carrying around a giant weight supposed to stop him getting away. Ice Troll was one of the images that came up from my archive... So... An ice troll... What do they need... lol, tissues!  A giant ice troll, living high in the mountains, composed mainly of gnashing teeth and bulging muscles, blowing his nose, cuz it gets damn chilly up there! Always the threat of a terrible cold, or even flu! =P That's weird enough for that =P   A quick other creative note  A group of three travellers have made their way into the marshes. Something is strange about these marshes tho, for water is always a degree from freezing, and a permanent frost grips the land. Later that night, one of the travellers was awoken by a strange sight. A glowing ball of fire, vaguely man shaped, but more of the sorts of a demon. He quickly awoke the wiser of the other two, "What's that! What do we do!" "Be quiet, he is of no risk to us at the moment. He is a permafrost beast, an Ice Cursor. They suck in the heat from the world around them, giving them life, form..." "Are they dangerous?" "Only if you are foolish. They are no raging beast, but if you are near them when they begin to burn out, you may find yourself frozen in seconds. They merely do not attack us now, for it would be too much trouble for them"  GO THE ICE CURSORS! =P   Anyway, that's it for today. Dinner is here (McDonalds =P)
