Actually, i'm sitting here counting the hours until it is time to get high!! I love to smoke pot because when you do, all of life's complicated problems can begin to seem so insignificant. It sucks that most places now drug test and considering my major, I ain't gonna be able to do it for too much terribly longer... well... I guess after I initially get the job I can smoke again, but at any rate it is definately one of my most favorite activities. I have been researching the best songs to get stoned to and I agree with some but I have compiled my own top ten list of stoner songs:  1. Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb (OMG, who doesn't love this) 2. Pink Floyd - Dark Side of The Moon (definately if synched to the wizard of oz) 3. Matchbox Twenty - Hand Me Down (ok, a downer, ,but who doesn't love rob either?) 4. Janis Joplin - Take Another Piece of My Heart (woah, now there's a stoner bitch) 5. Kansas - Dust In the Wind (the violin part is AWESOME) 6. The Who - Behind Blue Eyes (Limp Bizkits version is cool except for his L - I - M - P part) 7. The Kinks- Lola (It took me getting stoned to understand this song) 8. Eric Clapton - Layla (damn, I did inherit my father's genes) 9. 311 - Love Song (another downer, but excellently mellow) 10.Anything Celine Dion only b/c you sound like you can sing the hell outta something with her.  Well, there's other songs I like to.. but those are ones that really jump out at me. I can't believe I used to persecute people for being a stoner when there is so much beauty and deepness to the wonders of marijuana. Well, that's all I wanted to say for the time being.. I really need to be doing something, but I just don't have the will.
