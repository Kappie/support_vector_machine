Da bao took us to his parents house which was to be our room for the night. It was early evening so after the introductions we headed down to the local restaurant. We had an absolutely enormous meal, including tofu, pork ribs, delicious filled dumplings and several vegetables. It was really very nice and I felt guilty that the hot weather had really reduced my appetite. Still, the leftovers didn't go to waste; they were taken home to be eaten later.  After the meal, Yuqi, Da bao and me went to a large shopping mall to play some arcade games. After a gruelling air hockey match, motorcycle racing and a brief go on point blank 2 - they turned off the power to all the games to get us to leave! We then, walked down a very large pedestrianised shopping street. We took a lift above the shops into a large pool and snooker centre. We played three games of pool, and I'm happy to report I lost every single one! After my dreadful defeat, we went home to sleep.  This morning we woke up very early, and had breakfast together at Yuqi's Auntie's house. After that, we popped back to Da Bao's appartment to quickly use his computer and check our emails. The main event for the day was to visit Huang tai Ji's tomb which is situated in the middle of the city in a large park. After a short taxi ride, we arrived and started to look around. The weather was very hot, but there was a cool breeze which prevented the 33 degree temperature from being too overwhelming. The tomb itself is very impressive and comprises several traditionally styled buildings with some very intricate and beautiful stonework. I've got several photos - again, which will be revealed as soon as I can download them from my camera.  We were a little hungry after the tomb, so we decided to go for food. We went to a really very posh Korean style restuarant. Inside, it was styled very traditionally with rooms with low tables and chairs separated by sliding doors. We were given a huge selection of snacks ranging from sushi to spicy leaves. The meat was delivered to our table and grilled on hot coals in the centre of the table. It really was fantastic, and for the 9pounds price tag, great value for money.  finally, we headed back to Yuqi's Auntie's house for dinner and had a great long relaxing conversation over beer and a couple of VCD's. Now, we're just about to go to bed, so I'll update again tomorrow. Zai jian :)
