I just spoke via phone to elise, who was at java and allowed a few minutes in the bitter cold to talk to me in private. i called her due to dreadful thoughts of cutting and letting all my defective genes run out of my map of veins. i hate being me, i don't want another person to suffer my DNA. but elise is so very lovely, and she spoke to me about how such thoughts are not healthy for me. so i owe her. i am happy that i could talk to someone about this, especially to her about it.  sorry. randomness. cheers.
