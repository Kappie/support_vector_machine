I'm not very good when it comes to impulsive speeches like what I did yesterday, i always seem to come up with better stuff after I have finished.   Basically the "concerns" rasied where something that I think has been hanging overhead for some time. Now I will be the first to admit that I have lost touch with the going-ons in church. The army would be my excuse but we all know that its a lousy one. In any case, I have distilled the problems that are currently facing my area of the worship team, the Audio/Sound Support Team (Or A/S-ST as I like to call it, but thats just my geek self talking again).  1)Commitment - Frankly my team knows the roles and responsibilities that we are called for and we enjoy doing them.But I think there is a problem with commitment. Music practices are important. Not just for the music team but for the sound team as well. However as of late, only a few (err..like two?) members are showing up regularly. I know alot of members have loads of other commitments outside (see above said mentioned = army)but we have a commitment to serving God and the team as well. I think I will go back to setting up a roster where there will be at least two members present at each practice and every member attends at least one very month. Some will have to do more but thats to make up for the lack of manpower. Still have to remain flexible yet still be fair to everyone.  2)Training - I think there is an uneven balance of technical level within the group. This is partly due to the newcomers not having actual training sessions conducted for them. Also links back to the reason above. Will have to look into this and plan a good time to conduct training. And if possible, make it a regular event.  3)Manpower - very important. The basic role of the A/S-ST requires a certain level of manpower, thus I can't help but feel that we are currently lacking. Right now we have only a handful of active members. A few on backup roles and a couple "on job training". All in all, only less than a handful. My constant prayer is that more people will raise up to take up the seemingly "least glamourous" of all the worship ministries.  4)Unity - Not talking about Unity as in within the team itself, but as within the worship ministry as a whole. I believe when it comes to setting up the sound board for each person. you need to know their style, their Personality. And the only way to do this is to spend time with the person. Right now we only meet on sundays and sometimes on Saturdays for practice. Both times it is difficult to actually know their character. Some thing I am praying for as well.   > On a lighter note. I just found out today that I acutally have more days of leave than I thought I did. I must have mis-counted somewhere. Trust me to think the negative of things. So anyway this is very good news has I get to have more full days to study before my first exams in Dec.  > so now I will have to start planning my leave so I can submit it by end of the month. Have to plan well to maximise the most of the time. Boy I can't wait!   >
