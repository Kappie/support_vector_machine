Where do I start?  Oh, I went back to  urlLink sipi  for the spring trimester of '04.  I was expecting friends to be there, and supportive, and well, friends.  Yet, I show up, and things are so different.  They got jobs, they're apart of student senate, they're hooked up, and I guess what I'm trying to get at,  they're all growing up .  I felt a little lost there.  It wasn't anywhere near the same as when I last left.  I did meet some brothers though that are just crazy as all heck.  I don't think they mean to be, but that makes them even more dynamic.  Most of the time, I hung out w/ these two guys.  I also found out that my li'l intro to psychology class wasn't very much of a challenge?  I don't know what it was, but there was  li'l to no effort  on my part, but I  still manage to ace that class ?  I was actually proud though, because if that was so easy, then why did I  struggle  to even pass my other classes?  I know though, it's because I  expected  to  walk through  those ones and get the same results,  an easy A .  But, I did manage to pass the ole precalculas class somehow.  I also found out that even though I  HATE  speaking in front of a # of people, I still manage to project strongly when doing so.  It's so nerveracking though, but I think I could have managed to do better had I done it the required # of times expected of us.  I did some speeches here and there, but I kept thinking I wouldn't pass that class.  The teacher though, really like my presence?  He honestly shook my hand and sincerely thanked me for speaking?  It's weird, I'm so used to trying to stay two steps ahead of things that I always expect to be disciplined somehow instead of complimented.  So, when a teacher asks to speak to me privately I automatically start getting rigid and defensive.  That being said, I was thrown an  absolute curve ,  or change up , when I was complimented for what I've been doing in class.  I kept thinking though,  they just want me to ease up, then drop the hammer on me .  Too many years of being talked down to and abused psychologically back home I guess?  Needless to say, I was kinda tongue tied and had no clue on how to react.  I guess shock was predominantly visible, and even some nervousness.  But, I thanked them and went on my way.  But aside from that though, SIPI ended up being an alright experience for me.  I am always used to things  just staying how they were , and found out things, people, and places do actually  evolve  and  move on .  I guess it's a part of life I never quite got to experience here on the rez.  The only changes seem to be when things go from bad to worse.  Oh, and I totally blew up on weights.  Last time I was @ SIPI, I was maxing about 315 on bench press.  A very respectable weight no doubt.  But, this last time, I don't know what it was, but I worked up to doing 355.  In doing so though, I think I hurt my shoulder.  I actually try to keep lifting, even though my shoulder still hurts even 3 months later, and try to persue my goal of becoming a monster.  I don't think I'm there yet, but others would tend to disagree.  Then, something I don't know if it ever made it's way to it's mark, but I wrote a long email to a teacher I  absolutely  respected from my high school days.  It actually commended them for showing any type of positive reinforcement to a kid that never really got the benefit of the doubt for amounting to anything.  Yet, I was quiet and shy about things then and didn't say much to express the impact they had on me.  I did so down in SIPI, and never did get a reply?  So, I'm left to wonder if what I sent off even got read, or even mattered to them?
