Then there is team Houle/Mattson/Eric/Chris (Jason beat Mattson for number one seed ;)...) that should be interesting. I foresee that it will be doing much of the killing for the other teams. Also, there is team Hobie and the Jets. They will just have to run out of their rocket fuel sooner or later. Finally, team Shindo... and Andy. That will be bad.  Well, I can't go to anymore tennis meets so I'm pretty much done with that. I still have to see Van Helsing and Troy... but I probably won't see the latter until it comes out on VHS/DVD. I also have to get around to watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre again. Anyways, school is almost over and I think this summer will be great. A few things, like my car (along with other things), should make this a very good summer. Orchestra concert tomorrow. We suck. Thats about it for that. Also, I have to do that Gatsby essay on Wednesday and Thursday night. That will be fun. After that essay, all that is left is a Spanish test and a Math test...
