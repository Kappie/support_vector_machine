Now, it's not just words, it's also sounds and such or.. psuedo-words that are used commonly online.  Note : These words are in no particular order, I jsut numbered them to make is easier to follow.   Now, here's the list:     1)"Whatever"  Now, I don't know why this irritates me, it just bloody well does. When people say it, they're completely ignoring you, and, I believe that it would be like a shortened form of.. "Whatever you're saying, I'm ignoring it because I'm being a ho bag."  That's right, a ho bag, which, by common misconception, is not a bag of ho's, but, a bag of items used by ho's in their profession.  Now, back to the word. When people do say it, they give off an sorta feeling of superiority, a, I'm better than you so I don't have to listen, or, a feeling that you're annoying them, and, rather than just ASKING them to leave you alone, which, usually works except for those rather annoying ho bags, you give them a "Whatever" usually accompanied by an eye roll or a similar action.   In short. If you say whatever alot, every now and then is okay, but, if you say it alot, and, don't tell the people to leave you alone instead of doing the eye rolling torture. You need to be beaten with a sack of potatoes.   2) "Meh"   That's right, meh, it's a expression of disdain or I don't care-ness. It annoys me, because, everyone bloody says it, it's even more annoying when people say it to every single fucking thing you say. i mean.. if you want to bother me with ignorance, you might as well come up with somethign other than meh. Toss in the occasion 'that's nice' or, 'oh, really' or even an 'interesting' here and there.  Stop using Meh. It's just stupid, and, you don't sound very smart using it. Ho bags.   3) "Heh"  I hate it when people use 'heh' every other sentence, I mean, it's just an irritating little thing. It has a sound of disdain, a pompous feel to it, plus, god dammit, nto everything is so amusing you have to put heh every other sentence.  Once again, sack of potatoes, moving on.   4) "Cheese"  I've got nothing against cheese itself, but, everyone's using it, acting like its weird to use it alot, it's not, it's just uninteresting, forget about the dairy product, move on, it doesn't make you cool in a weird way.  We should stop using the sack of potatoes now, they're prolly getting squished and drippy, and, I don't want potato juice on my floor.  We'll instead use a random senator.  Next!   5) "Ain't"  Come on you slack jawed idiots, it isn't that hard to just say.. well.. Isn't. Ain't is not a real word, it's slang, it's in the dictionary, AS SLANG. So, stop using the excuse it's not in the dictionary other people. Because, it is, but, it's slang, it's improper, feel free to use it, but, hey, just use Isn't every now and again, it's nicer than ain't, and, makes you sound less like a man named Jim with a rifle.  The more a person says ain't, the more I expect them to hunt down a fat man, and, make him squuuueeeeaaaaal like a pig.  And, with the people that say ain't that I know, the fat man's probably the more attractive one too.  Once again, use that senator, we can prolly give him a concussion and kill two idiots with one stone.     Aaand, you know what, that's all I can think of at the moment.  I'm sorry if I've offended any users of the above words, I'm just bored, and, gah, too many people say them, and, it gets on my nerves.   -Teh Bret O_o;  Wishing that he actually had a sack of potatoes
