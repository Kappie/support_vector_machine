I guess I'll just talk about my day, because yes, I'm just  that  cool.      Today I decided to sleep in. I've been getting up at 8 every day, and I guess I just didn't feel like it, so I ended up waking up at 11:30. my mom was just about ready to order out Chinese for lunch, and she asked me ifI wanted anything before she left. I was like,  Whoa, she's actually ordering out!  and quickly put in my order. I wasn't very hungry, as I had just woken up, so I snacked on it throughout the day. Chinese food is my life, except for the fact that 2 hours later you're ready to eat again, hahaha.     ANYWAY, then I went to the oral surgeon's office to schedule my next procedure (August 12th, people) So I'll be out of commission for a couple daysafter it's all said and done. I'm really not looking forward to it, but whatever. The guy was actually pretty cool, and he kept saying how with the drugs I won't remember anything, which actually after a while got a bit unsettling. I was glad that he wasn't all quiet, boring,antisocial, and dry as normal doctors normally tend to be.      So when I got back I hung out with Krystal and ran errands for my mom downtown. On the way back we got caught in a freak rainstorm. It felt really good to just not care about staying dry or anything. That's one thing I love about summer. The rain actually turned out to be a thunderstorm, so Krystal and I were even happier, because we both absolutely love thunderstorms.      Now I'm sitting here, realizing that I've run out of things to say. Peut etre it's a good time to stop typing. Peut etre...      Oh well, I'll guess I'll talk to you later guys! *hugs*
