Questions in my mind, Questions constantly running, Questions constantly running in my mind. I keep asking why? Yet my answers run dry. Then I realize something, Something dumb, Something idiotic, Something desperate. I want to be loved, I want to be noticed. I want to see if someone cared, To see if someone wants their opinion shared. I wanted to see if someone had an opinion of me. I really wanted to see. Now, I met you guys, Who took the time to have your opinions shared. Yet there is one opinion I still would love to know, If you don't mind letting it show... Do you love me? Do you notice me? Do you care for me? Do you?
