I'm socially moderate to liberal, and fiscally/governmentally moderate to conservative.  I believe in a more pragmatic conservative agenda.  I am a Jeffersonian on one hand, who is suspect of government, a believer in local control, and someone who feels government is not the only answer.  But I am also fairly Lincolnian and Rooseveltian (Theodore) because I believe there are certain things the government must do or help do because the people can't do it all themselves.  Needless to say I've had my major disagreements with the Bush Administration.  I wasn't even an initial supporter.  I voted for Gore in 2000 (no clue why), and I supported Wesley Clark in the primary.  But in their infinite wisdom the Democrats nominated a hair-do: John Kerry.  The man is not much more than the disturbingly perfectly groomed hair on his freakishly marble chiseled head.  The man has to be everything to everyone, and because of this he fails so miserably.  If he'd just stand up for something and stop bitching and moaning and take a stand he'd be better off.  So would we.  Since my man Wesley Clark lost and John Kerry won, I've been in the Bush corner because I simply cannot vote for a guy who takes no stance.  But now I'm starting to question everything.  Its really hard because I joined the college Republicans at my school.  Big Bush supporters, they are.  Its also filled with conservatives, one or two religious right guys, and only one moderate that I know of.  Its really hard.  I'm being pulled in two different directions.  Oh well.  I'm a madman.  I'm like Mad Max, and the CR group is like Thunderdome.  Don't ask me who the retarded guy is.  Alrighty, now to the thing that has me really down and fairly angry.  Was reading one of my favorite bloggers,  urlLink Andrew Sullivan , and he linked to a  urlLink developing story  on the Bush's apparent approval of torture techniques against enemy combatants.  Basically it has to do with the al Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo, but it has had far reaching consequences in Iraq.  Bush apparently approved it personally.  Granted, he didn't explicitly approve of torture against Iraqi prisoners.  But that's not the point.  What was he doing allowing torture against anyone at all?  I thought the US was better than that, but apparently I was wrong.  Actually, I'm not wrong.  The US is better than this, and the rest of the world knows it.  Its just that the Bush Administration isn't better than this.  I'm expecting the administration to move into hair splitting mode and justify the actions by claiming they were meant for "enemy combatants" and not POWs.  What's the difference?  Is one not accorded the basic human rights that we claim to love and cherish so much?  As a friend once said to me, if this is a War on Terrorism, why aren't the prisoners in Guantanamo listed as prisoners of war?  And if they aren't POWs, then is the War on Terrorism really a war?  I swear I heard the Bush Administration say the prisoners there were being treated according the Geneva Convention.  Well, it appears as though they might have lied.  Its sad because for a while I thought Bush was actually a good guy.  I disagreed with some of his actions and policies.  I don't believe the war in Iraq was an oil grab; I think there was a legitimate worry.  Saddam Hussein was a long-term threat at the most, and better to deal with him now than in the future against a rearmed Iraq.  But now I'm questioning most everything.  I'm not sure what to do.  I don't want to vote for John Kerry.  I think he's a dolt.  I don't think he will do anything of note.  I don't want to vote for the lesser of who cares.  Of course, I could always vote LaRouche...
