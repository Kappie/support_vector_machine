I wrote a terrible essay describing my grandmother's apartment, trying to show through her possessions that she has a dynamic personality, that she's an interesting person..but the three page limit kinda kept me from going into enough detail to get that across.  I guess I understand the compulsion to write a novel, it's hard to get enough detail on a few pages to get a decent idea across without out and out saying it.  Anyway, Nadia said hi to me today after not talking to me for a little while.  I guess Stephanie convinced to ignore cause she didn't like me for whatever reason.  It's a good thing cause I didn't really like her all that much, though Nadia's cool.  Have you ever felt really really tired, but only mentally?  Like, a feeling of being drained, as if the frontal lobe of your brain could get fatigued.  I got that today...I could barely think for 3 or 4 hours, it's a terrible feeling.  Never actually had that before, it makes me feel really really stupid, like when I was high, absolutely drained and slow.  I guess that's what it feels like to be stupid and try and concentrate on a difficult concept, it just can't be done.  I hope I keep this thing updated..and I actually read through it later, I read through old e-mail now and it makes no sense, so many allusions that I can't remember.  This seems more stable and permanent, you know?  Maybe I won't be able to lose my junior year in the same way I've lost the rest of my life.  Crappy form of immortality, but it's the only one we's gots.  hmm, well, I'd better get to sleep, talk to you later blog!
