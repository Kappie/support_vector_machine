It made sounds similiar to that my parents would make if they were makng love...so, obviously, it kept me up in disgust.  I woke up, real tired, and went to school anyway, did the the whole go to class thing, and then went to messinas with rob for a enlighting visit to the little italian deli, all along carrying my guitar i brought in for music class, which i brought cause i didn;t wanna leave it in there for a bout 2 weeks.  Anyway, right after that, i went to go do my schedual w/ my guidance counsular.  I'm gonna take SUNY Engilsh, SUPA Forensics, Math 4, S.E.L.F, Film and Lit, and Italian 1.  Thats pretty much it, give or take some stuff.  ya, well, that wasn't the highlight of my day...the highlight had to be seeing my report card....turns out i DIDN'T fail math, he bumped me up to a D- which i'm grateful for...BUT, i did fail english for the second time(Which i already knew), AND APUSH, which REALLY sux cause i thought i definitly did better than a F.  But w/e, ya ain't gonna solve anything by cryin', i'll juss do better or something, i think i aready am anyway.  Well, ya, after that, the day went pretty smoothly, Rob along with the rest of us started the first rounds on OHS Mole, which, took alittle longer than expected, but got done.  Marzella (along with myself at times) was being a dick wit the guitar, but i restrained my self.  I'm not like Hernandez and jorge always trying to show off whatever they got at me.  Like rob said, theie prolly insecure with something, and have to make it up by trying to out due someone in something, unfortunatly, it has to be guitar... It is VERY annoying having to go through it, everytime, it;s juss fucking sickening.  And the crazy part is, i like those guys, i've always said that, they're great dudes, but its juss that damn guitar playing.  Maybe i should try getting into a different hobbie, maybe start collecting condoms, or...dirty diapers...lol, no, maybe not that, but i dunno, i'll see...i've been getting ALOT more into cars considering i'm gonna start driving alittle sooner than planned, (my dad RULES!) so maybe i'll get into that.  Anyway, that was pretty much the school day in a nut shell, nothing more about that.  I dunt really remmeber much acutally, cause i was so damn out of it, but i remmeber enough to know that i wore a REALLY fucked up shirt today, i nick named it the "Toxic Avenger" shirt cause one side + the back of it are green, like ooze.  ya, i prolly won;t wear it again, but since it was a gift from my mom, i mostly likely AM gonna put it on again.  OO!!!! OMG OMGOMGOMG, i juss remembeerd a REALLY crazy movie we saw in spanigh today (cause my teacher and ALOT of students are going to spain like...tommarrow?) it's this crazy french film, a surreal film, a black and white silent film, REAL old, Directed by Luis Bunvel, and was co-directed by Salvador Dali, a fmous artist dude.  Ya, it's called urlLink Un Chien Andalou  and is DEFINITLY one of my all time fav. films.  Like, if i ever become a film maker of some sorts (which has crossed my mind) i would make films like this.  It;s fucking NUTS MAN!! Like seeing a duck taking a shit UP CLOSE! it juss blows your MIND!! (Sorry, i juss finished 7 liters of coca-cola.....well, not really).  Well, ya, that was juss a little didly on that....DON't forget to visit the    urlLink photo gallery  to catch pics of all of us.  I'm the one with the beard...thats all you gotta know...Well, ya, we played that Star Wars role playing game today...we ended up DLing the books and ad to change somestuff on our character sheet.  The role playing gang consists of  urlLink jones,     urlLink mike,   urlLink ben,   urlLink jorge,    urlLink myself,  and  urlLink Ivan.  Ivan is CRAZY!  But ya, so we played and what not, and now i'm here, writing in this thing.  Alot of random shit happened today, like i broke my leg, saved a baby, and ate a enitre pig, but that stuff wasn't intresting at all.  I rather juss attempt to work on the Circuit-Bored? site, the site for my show, but thats getting no where....i'm prolly juss gonna end up making a simple HTML one, nothing special, just something.  O! sunday is the J-mans (Jorge) birthday, still dun't know what were gonna do, but it should be awsome, so happy B-day to him.  And the next week we should all be over at    urlLink jones'  for a mega LAN party, which should kick ass.  We plan on having ALOT of fun (not that way), and get like 2 or 3 episodes of circuit-bored? done if everything goes how i plan. o, and i have to go to my lil' bro's baptism tomarrow..dun wanna, but i have to...cause jesus told me he'll give me a dollar....(sucker)  But ya, overall, it's been a crazy day. PEACEZORZ TO THE  urlLink MAXZORZ!! ..... urlLink HOLY SHIT!! IT CAN SMELL MY FEAR!!!!  P.S: Sorry for all the typos...but i warned ya!!  urlLink MUAHAHAHAH!!
