The kid they brought up to pitch today for Ramirez faired pretty well but of course the Braves provided little offense attack scoring only one run. Chipper was out again after he was hit by a pitch in the knee two nights ago. Mike Hessman is also playing first for LaRoche.This will be very intresting to see if the braves can continue there run at first place. It will be a challenge for them but i have faith in the best manager Bobby Cox and the Best GM John Schurholtz to pull them through this. When Chipper and Giles finally get helathy hopefully they will make a run for first again.
