Well some times it is, becuase this was very rare, but I've actually been way to busy this week to write in this. I have been doing so much stuff. So sit back, and be ready for the longest post I have ever written. This baby is going to be huge, well thats if I can remember all of it. I can't even remember half of it now. But I have been hanging out with Kyle alot. One of the days we went to little ceasors for lunch because you can get a pizza for 5 bucks! And that's just crazy not to go and do that, so we road there. Me and Kyle always have awesome luck and wierd things to. Kyle, going to Krogers first that day was an amazing thing on your part lol. And our trips to K-mart because no one goes to K-mart ever. And then off to Walmart we always go, because people actually go there. We have done that pretty much everyday this week. On Thursday, the 8th, I went out to lunch with Kyle, and then we hung out. And then I went home. And then I went back over there and we watched the Breakfast Club which is the best movie in the entire world! And then we just sat outside for a little, and then Andrew came over and they did thier math, and I just watched them as they did crazy things. Then they finally got most of it done, and we decided we were going out to eat. So me and Kyle had our bikes, and Andrew is crazy and he ran home and we followed on our bikes. Wow, I can never run home I'm not that out of shape. But we got to his house, and he got some money, and then he got his bike, and then we went to my house and I got my money. And then we went to Dairy Queen for dinner. I got two cheese burgers, and I tried some of Kyles Moco Ice thing. I was going to get one, but they are like 4 bucks. And I could get a much better one at Starbucks for the same price. So I decided against paying the 4 bucks and I just tired Kyles. Then after we were all done, we rode to the swimmeet. There I talked to Amanda and everyone and watched Amanda swim. I met Zac who is new, and a really cool kid. And me, Kyle, and Andrew just hung out there. We played cards, which didn't work out well, because people are just plain idiots. And then we just talked for awhile. I talked to Taylor there, I haven't talked to her forever so it was good to talk to her again. And I talked to everyone else there, like Natalie, and just everyone else. Then I had millions of people come up to me and told me to ask Amanda out. So me and Amanda left early, and I walked her home. And we talked for like a half an hour on her driveway, and I did what they told me to, I asked her out :-D. So at around 9:20 on July 8th, 2004, I became a very happy man and got a wonderful girlfriend. Amanda... wow :-D she is just so cool. But then I had to go home because my mom called me and told me to get my brother at the pool and bring him home. So I had to go do that, and then I came home and got online and talked. I found out that Taylor was asked out by Chris on that night too! So we both have like the same day aniversery things! That is so awesome! Natalie enlightend me on that lol. So thanks Natalie! So that's awesome for Taylor and Chris. But, becuase of all that I didn't get any of my term paper accomplished, but oh well. So I just went to bed a happy kid. Then I got up on Friday and went to school. I took a very easy test given by Angle Lee and Abby House. And then Parrot and Collin gave there presentation. And then we had our break, and in our break, we just decided we weren't going back to class. So we just didn't lol and waited till Mr. Reem had to come out and get us. He wasn't mad though which was cool. But what could of he have done to us anyways? Almost half the class was out there lol. But there is always those people who go in and rat us out, which I think two did. But oh well, Mr. Reem is cool. And then after school, I came home and I think I went back out to eat with Kyle and hung out with him again. But I could be wrong, this was awhile ago. But I did all that, and then I came home. And Amanda wanted to go to see Sleep Over with everyone. So me, Kyle, Zac, Marcus who I don't know, Natalie, Kacy, Whitney, and Amanda all went and saw Sleep Over. Wow, was that the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Its for 10 year old girls who need to feel good about themselves, no joke. It's going to put images in there minds to make them think they can do things like that, which they can't. It's just not possible. But after the movie, it was storming out, and we went home. And then I just talked online for awhile, and then went to bed. On Saturday, I woke up and I don't remember what I did. Umm... I think I hung out with Kyle again. But I don't know for sure. I really don't remember what I did on Saturday afternoon. Maybe I didn't do anything, oh well, its a lost in my memory. But I went to church at 5:00 I know that, and I sat with Haley and Kristen, and then afterwards I went out to Mcdonalds with my parents. And I hate how Mcdonalds was so dirty, so I refused to sit in there, so I went outside and sat in the car, that didn't make my parents very happy, but oh well, it's better then sitting in filth. And then after that, KLT and Haley came over, and then Kyle called and we invited him over too. We started to watch the New Guy which is a great movie but they didn't like it lol, so we switched DVD's to Big Trouble with Tim Allen in it. I love that movie to, but Kyle and Haley thought it was retarded lol, but oh well, it had goats and that awesome toad lol! That movie is just so random. But then Haley had to leave around like 8:00 and we just finished watching the movie, and then I called Amanda and asked what she was up to, so we decided to go visit her and Whitney at Whitney's house. So me, KLT, and Kyle walked over there and we talked for awhile, and then we had to leave, so Kyle just road home, and then me and KLT walked back to my house. And we got there and just talked, and then KLT left. And then around 10:25, Amanda called me and told me to go outside, so I went and her and Whitney had walked over! So I talked to them till around 10:50 when they had to leave, and then I went inside and just talked online for awhile, and then I went to bed. Then on Sunday, yes I am almost done with this post, it's long I know, deal with it. But I got up like at 8:00 becaues my family was being so loud. And then around like 8:30, they said they were leaving for Bloomington and if I wanted to go, I needed to get ready. Well I already had stuff planned for the day so I didn't go. So I slept in and then got up and just downloaded like 50 albums till around 12:00, you have to love IRC and free music. And then I had to get ready. At 12:45 I rode over and got Kyle and then we went to Pizza Hut for Bree's going away party thing. We had to wait for a table because pizza hut was packed and we had like 17 people with us. It didn't take as long as we thought it would though. And we just ate tons of pizza becuase oviously its all you can eat. And yeah, I wanted my freaking 6 bucks worth. So I ate alot. Then after we were done, we all decided to go over to Lincoln, and this is the most random thing ever, but so awesomely cool, we played this huge game of dodge ball with like 30 people. It was crazy! It was so much fun though, it was hot outside, but it was just an awesome random thing you do in your life. We played that for over 2 hours, and then me and Ryn walked home and went to his house to start on our APS project. We have to make 2 1 minute commericals on a political figure. It's going to be easy, and were going to make it hilarious. But Mary came over and we didn't get any work done lol, it was a very interesting day lol. But it was hilarious. But then she took us to Taco Bell and payed for us so you have to love Mary! But by all this time, after Taco Bell and when I got home, it was around 7:00. And I still hadn't started on my term paper yet, so I started on that. And then my parents told me someone came over to see me, so I went outside and it was Brian, and we talked for a little. And then some thing out of the very randomness in this world happend. Two clowns, one with a mask of paper, ran at me with squirt guns and squirted me with water for about 2 minutes lol, while I was extremly confused on what was going on in this freaky world. Then they ran off. It was the funniest thing ever. When they ran off I noticed it was Andrew and Kyle lol. Brian just laughed and told me they asked him to come get me outside for they could do that lol. And Kyle just told me to call them the Caped Crusaders lol. But you have to love them. They dressed up in clown out fits and then went through the nieghboorhood to my house like that lol. It was the coolest thing ever lol. But after they ran off, and I was all wet, I went inside and stripped down and put on new clothes. And then Amanda called and told me I could come over and watch a movie. So I got on my bike and rode over there, but on the way there I forgot that it had rained, and since I'm just a moron like that, I rode through some grass, and then I felt all this mud and water splash all over me, and I was all dirty on the clothes I had just changed into lol. But I got to Amanda's and we watches this really bad, sick, nasty, wierd movie called Monster. Never rent that lol, it was just nasty. There was this lesbian couple thing in the movie, and they were the main characters, and one was a hooker who turned serial killer. Yeah, not for kids, or even my age at that lol and I totally wished I had never of saw that movie. But I got to be with Amanda so it was all good lol. But then I had to leave early, because I had to go at least get some more of my term paper done. So I rode home and my term paper put me in a very bad mood. But I got over half of it done, so that's good. Then I just listend to music and talked online till about 10:45, and then I went upstairs and had a sandwhich and a bowl of Rasin Bran, you have to love that Rasin Bran. Then I finally went to bed. And today I got up and went to school, took Parrots and Collin's test from Friday, and then Mollie taught her chapter, and for her game we played Around the World. And man, that brought up memories of grade school and how I loved that game so much. And then we had our break, and then we just talked about politcal stuff afterwards for about an hour with Mr. Reem. Then he let us out 10 minutes early, and I waited for my mom to pick me up, and we gave Ryn a ride home, and then I came home and I started typing this at around 10:30 and now its like 11:00. This thing is huge! Wow, if you read this you have way to much time on your hands, I even have to admit that. I have way to much time on my hands right now to be writing all this. But oh well, I think I'm going to go out to eat with Kyle again today lol. But I need to stop typing this my had is starting to hurt. Well if you just read all this, you are awesome and I owe you a cookie! Maybe even two cookies! Well time to go, have a great day! And sorry again for not updating this for awhile, I'll update the CD of the week when I'm done typing all this. Well see-ya!
