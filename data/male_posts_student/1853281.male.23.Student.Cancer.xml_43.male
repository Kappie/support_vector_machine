Up early on friday for a 4 hour car ride to wisconsin with jannie. roamed over the land from 3 till like 7, than built a fire, and sat watching it, feeling uncomfortable with the darkness and the woods, than a ten minute walk back to the car feeling like a bad extra from the blair witch porject. Talked to my aunt and uncle for like a half hour and than to bed. saturday: up at eight, by nine helped run the splitter, that broke down so helped unload that truckfull of wood while jannie and jill stacked it. Proceded to continue unloading trucks of wood until 7:30 pm. Ow. Really ow. I have bruises and could not walk the next day. Sunday: painfull carride back, than just sitting on my couch, groaning every time i had to move, and wishing i had some one to rub my sore muscles. Not writing the paper i was supposed to. so tonight, writing that damn paper
