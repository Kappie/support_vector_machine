There are so many things wrong with going to war with Iraq, a simple blog entry cannot sum up every single one.  I am glad Saddam is out of power. He was an evil dictator. I am not glad, though, that he was thrown from power through means of invading the country he once ruled. It wasn't smart.  Why? Well...  A.) It creates an unstable country, a quagmire if you will. B.) The citizens of Iraq are sick and tired of getting screwed over. Whether it's living under an oppressive regime or living in an unstable country that lacks basic necessities and order but overcompensates for American occupation, the Iraqi people don't want it. I recently saw an interview with an Iraqi citizen in which he said something to the effect of: "I would shake my hand with the Devil to end the suffering of the Iraqi people, to put stability back into Iraq." They don't care who fixes things, just as long as they are fixed. If America is incapable of stabilizing Iraq (and understandably so, it's an impossible mission), then America certainly doesn't need to invade Iraq and make things worse. However, once you break it, you own it. George W. Bush bought Iraq for America and has consequently put America into one of the worst positions it has been in for decades. C.) The invasion proved to Muslims worldwide that the War on Terrorism is a war on Islam. I know the War on Terrorism is not a war on Islam, but that is what millions of Muslims now think. How is this supposed to make America and the world safer? The invasion of Iraq created a haven for international terrorists, energized al-Qaida's cause, and tarnished America's image- spreading anti-American sentiment like wildfire across the globe.  I am not glad that there are countless other evil dictators around the world. Should we go to war to remove every single one of them? Are we the global police? Bush thinks so. By acting as the global police, you provide yourself with everlasting war, which for Bush, is providing yourself with everlasting job security. This will work until something is done to stop the madness.  Let me show you an analogy I came up with for the tenth anniversary of Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman's murders. It goes like this...  I do not approve of O.J. Simpson. I believe he escaped the justice owed to him from his dual homicides. Should I, against the will of other Americans, against the tenets of common sense, and against the restrictions set up by law, take justice into my own hands and capture him? What would happen if, in the process of my mission, I accidentally injure or kill his innocent children? Oh well, I still think I should go for it. I need to liberate the Simpson kids. Does anyone want to join my Coalition of the Willing? The white Bronco may be slow, but it holds plenty of oil!  I understand that war is never not going to be an option. Sometimes, you have to go to war. The key phrase is HAVE TO. With the horrors of war running far and deep, war should be an absolute last resort, falling leaps of steps behind diplomacy. I mourn the killed and wounded in war. I believe every limb and life surrendered in the name of one's country is tragic yet noble and admirable. Injury and death in unjustified wars are almost even more tragic, as unjustified wars produce unjustified and unnecessary results. The decision to go to war should never be made lightly, should never be decided upon before entering office, and should never involve lies, deceit, the destruction of America's vital bridges to her closest allies, and the tarnishing of America's image.
