So, I got pared off with Tina and I thought it would be ok, but we did horrible in 2v2. We got 1 win in total and 13 loses just the first time. So, then we got in our teams. I was on light blue with some other kids I knew. Then we had lunch which wasn't bad, expect I had two things to eat. Then when we were doing 2v2 again, Tina told me that we should switch into the other gym. So we did and now it stinks, so tomorrow I'm going to switch back. Now, I have swim team. I'm so excited, lol.
