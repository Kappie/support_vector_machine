This week was one of them. So damn thankful.  I got a new monitor. It's a Cornea CT1702. 17" LCD with TV tuner, Svideo, composite and DVI. It's got a fucking remote. Hot damn. I can turn my fucking monitor on from bed.  The video for work went swimmingly last week. Hopefully it will do so again this week. I think my next purchase past this monitor will be a DV cam. I need to start using my digicam more though.speaking of which, I'm gonna charge that little fuckers batteries now.  Catch you on the flip side y'all. We're counting printers in the am.
