AHH!! but, yeah, monday (yesterday) i went to school for like 3 1/2 hrs b/c we have STAR testing this week (which im not taking), and our schedule is all wacked out...  today, at 8:30 this morning, my aunty teresa called and told us that my aunty angela's baby (she was in labor) died...something happened while he was inside the womb and he was born dead. our families are taking this tradgedy very hard, and we're not sure why the Lord let it happen. I remember when paul sharp passed last april...we didnt know what it meant at the time, but the tragic event brought many ppl to the Lord. God makes bad things happen for a reason, and though we may not understand it at the time, they're actually good things. my aunt would have loved and cared for that baby, and the Lord knows it, but we can have peace in the promise that the baby's in heaven now with the Lord Jesus Christ, and we'll see him again one day. in memory of the newborn, i'd like to dedicate today (his would be b-day)- April 20th, 2004- to him.
