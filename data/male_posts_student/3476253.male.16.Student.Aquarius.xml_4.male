I remember last night, I kinda blew off a girl I really liked because I wanted to play xbox, and now I'm talking to her, and I brought up something about a movie, and she said she was gonna see it, but I got cold feet :( .  A friend of hers said that this girl would go out with me if I asked, but she was unsure whether I liked her or not.  Not only do I like her, but I'm in love with her!  Everything about her is so perfect, but a lot of the time I just don't think I'm good enough for her...ah well, I can't believe I told my bud I was waiting for a perfect chance to ask her out, and when that chance came I just couldn't do it :( .  Ah well, I'll be running cross country with her over the summer, maybe I'll be able to tell her how I feel face to face when another good chance arrives.
