When you give him a straw, he'll want a long, fancy straw with a few loops in it. When you give him the fancy straw, he'll ask where you got it, and you'll say a bodega, and naturally, he'll want to go. When you get to the bodega, he'll probably want some weed. When you give him the weed, he'll probably get the munchies. And when you give a moose the munchies, he'll probably ask for a muffin.
