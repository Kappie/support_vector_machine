It occurs naturally to all humans, to all living things. It is a natural phenomenon so why should we be afraid of it. Recently, people have been more and more afraid of death, trying all ways to stop and halt death. Why? Because people fear death. They fear it.   	It is  very noticeable that the more civilized and developed society and country is, their people gradually grow more and more frightened of death. They cannot accept death. They think death as negative and should be avoided which is of course, sadly to them, not possible. On the other hand, people from villages or not so developed societies or communities are the opposite. They are not afraid of death and see death as part and parcel of life, something unavoidable, and in fact not fear it but accept it. They believe that death is something natural and know that life is never eternal so why are we, in the developed society who are supposedly to be more intelligent, be afraid of death?   	Have you ever tried consoling a person when he is dying? You would definitely have said, “Don’t worry. You won’t die.” Do you know how painful that is for the person? He knows that he cannot live much longer and yet denying him from death is especially painful. The clasp on him makes him so sad to leave this world. He knows that he is dying but yet you are denying him from doing that.   	Death is inevitable. Life is never eternal. Humans have lived long without fearing death until all so recently. When we understand death and take it as part and parcel of life, we would have achieved nirvana and the state of enlightenment. This is when we would learn not to fear death, but accept it and allow others to accept it to and release them from our chains and shackles of pain we have burdened them with.
