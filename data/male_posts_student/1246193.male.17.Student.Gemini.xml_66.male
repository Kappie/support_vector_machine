Sleep just doesn't do what it used to.  I wake up exhausted and ready for the day to be over.  Everyone is dying.  I watch the news and I don't understand how we can live in a world like this.  We aren't phased by death or destruction and I can't imagine how we possibly deal with this shit...and yet we do.  It is the great ability of the human race, to adapt.  We constantly change, for different reasons and in different ways, everyone does.  Unfortunately, it seems that it is rarely for society's benefit.  I sincerely pray that things start to improve, not in my life but in the world.  I do what I can but I guess it isn't enough.  I am tired...physically, mentally, emotionally.  It is someone elses' turn, I can't do it anymore.
