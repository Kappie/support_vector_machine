I think there was a fault or something though because most of my images turned out blurry and the batteries kept draining really fast (which is unusual). So I got home and tried charging it but it wouldn't. So I went to sleep and when I woke up and installed an upgrade into the camera. Now everything seems to be working just fine. None of them turn out blurry anymore. So tomorrow morning at 4.00am I am going to a massive park with rivers and waterfalls and everything, so I should have some fairly exciting shots this time tomorrow. Hopefully the weather will be nice...
