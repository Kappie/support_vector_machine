I'm not saying it's Dominique's fault, I am saying that the friends that I have aren't really my friends much if they only talk to me while I am around Dominique. That's all many people even care about anymore.   "Friend": Where's Dominique? Me: She's at work. "Friend": Oh, okay; bye. *They walk off* Me: Bye...I guess.  Well then, that's real fun, now isn't it? I don't know how many of you guys really know how that feels, you may or may not know. I'm going to go now.
