I was being the victim of a steady succession of really bad music, to the point that I was going to give up to a virulent reality show or a low budget sitcom. After probably 20 minutes of  “Hit me baby one more time”, “I’m pretty, that’s why you buy my album”, and “We are all sweaty ‘cause we shake our booty,” they abruptly appeared.  For a moment I thought I had changed the channel by mistake, I saw these Hispanic looking guys dressed with clothes that somehow resembled Tex-Mex bands, but no, I was still with VH1. They were three, two of them would have been considered fat for the American standards, and the last one, the vocalist, was tall and slim but with very long hair, maybe too long to be reckoned cool. Two of them, also, had the incipient and immature mustaches that reveal the old mixture of Spaniard and Indian blood in a past generation. They were not the kind of people you usually expect to see on that particular TV station.   For my amusement, the music was great, the tunes very well constructed, and the lyrics decently catchy. The voice of the vocalist was not pretty, even better, it was cool. The band is just great as a whole. Their name, “Los Lonely Boys”, and the song “Heaven.” So if you want to hear a song that will make you feel cool while singing in the shower, while trying a new move looking at yourself in the mirror, or while driving on the highway at nigh or by the beach; give it try, you may enjoy it very much. Vamonooosss!!!
