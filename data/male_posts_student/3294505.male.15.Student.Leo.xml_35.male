I never felt this way, like I feel cornered...  On another note, I've nothing to do, and noone to talk to. Going outside is a great option...that is to say, I'm too tired to... And that isnt an excuse. Almost every day for the past 2-3 weeks I go home and almost immediately take a nap. I dont even remember mentioning that, which I probably did.... Oh well. Rambling is fun.
