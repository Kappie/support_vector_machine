It was my first day back at work and they seemed to have a feild day at giving me a hard time with things.  It wasn't cool!  I mean all damn day they had joy in giving me a hard time.  It's just not a cool thing at all!  I hope that tommarow will be a better day.  It's only a matter of time before things are going to get better.    "Everything has a begining has an end."  Last night we had a rain storm that was REALLY bad.  I mean it flooded streets that in my entire life, I have never seen flood in El Paso.  It was really bad.    "If for only one minute can one be lost in a single drop of rain."  On the other side of things, Paul has yet to pay me.  That's not a good thing!  I need that money.  I could of spent the time at work, yet, I took the week off to rest.  IT SUCKS!!  The first of the month is coming and I have two dollars to my name.  That's not cool at all.  I just have a lot of shit on my mind.  I need to vent!    I spend the time to write becuase I find some kind of reasoning to what I say.  It's kind of a hard thing to understand but it works for me.  I think it's because I actually have a chance to sit back and look at my life from a different point of view.  well, today, I went to Comp USA with Maria and looked at a few things that we might want for the APT, but we have no money to buy them.  We can still dream right?    Anyways, my plans for my Monte are slowly coming along.  I think it might take a year or two, but I still want my dream.  She's going to run a eight!  I know it!  On the other hand, the Civic that I just bought, is a long way off from being paid for.  Yet, I still don't have any rights to the damn car.  That pisses me off too.  I can't touch the damn thing.  I can't put my 500 dollar system in it, an alarm..., nothing and yet I'm paying for it!  Can you beleave that?  I'm really tired right now ...  I need to get some rest, but I can't find the time or even the energy to rest.  It's a sad fact that you need energy to rest.  Well, with me that's how it is.    Anyways, I'll chat with you guys later ...  John      apt06.29.04_09-00pm
