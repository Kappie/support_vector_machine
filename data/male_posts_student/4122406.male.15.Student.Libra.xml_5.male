Turns out it was about 4! Luckily, we had a toilet break at a place called  urlLink Lacock . This village is home to  urlLink Lacock Abbey , the location for parts of  urlLink 'Pride  Prejudice'  and the Harry Potter films.   urlLink     A rather bright view of the Abbey   urlLink     Part of Lacock Village itself   urlLink     Some historic building in Lacock! It just looked nice.  Then we eventually got to Galstonbury. After parking to coach, we made our way to The Shrine of Our Lady of Glastonbury.  urlLink     Upstairs in the Church hall, we had 'elevenses' at 12.30 (Somerset cream tea!), and met up with Geoffrey Ashe and his wife.  urlLink    The man is  urlLink Dale Ahlquist , President of the Chesterton Society in the US. He was the one who brought over all the Americans of the Chesterton Pilgrimage. The woman in white standing next to him is Geoffrey's wife.   urlLink     Geoffrey talking to the Monseigneur.   urlLink     Geoffrey talking in the Shrine.  After the talk, Geoffrey took us round the grounds of the Abbey at Glastonbury.  urlLink     This is the approach to the Abbey, with the tower coming over the roofs.   urlLink     Part of the remains of the Abbey - it was torn down with the dissolution of the monastaries in the Reformation.   urlLink    This is the archway seen in the last photo. One of the decorative arches - about the third one out from the middle - tells the story of the first few chapters from St. Matthews Gospel.   urlLink    Standing by King Arthur's alleged, but unmarked  grave .  urlLink    The actual ground. His body, found here under a lead cross was then exhumed by monks, and placed in a tomb by the High Altar.   urlLink    Part of Dale Ahlquist's family and Geoffrey Ashe plus wife.   urlLink     King Arthur's  tomb . The sign reads:  "In the Year 1101, the bodies of King Arthur and his Queen were said to have been found on the South Side of the Lady Chapel. On 10th April 1278, their remains were removed in the presence of King Edward I and Queen Eleanor to a black marble tomb on this site. This tomb survived until the dissolution of the Abbey in 1539."    urlLink     Another shot.   urlLink     Legend has it that Joseph of Arametheia planted his staff at Glastonbury, and it grew into a thorn bush. The strange thing about this thornbush, is that it is only native to the Holy Land. Geoffrey and his wife standing under it. This is not the orignal bush - the original is on a hilltop nearby.  After the tour of the Abbey, a group of us decided to walk up to the  urlLink Tor .  urlLink     This is it from the streets below. We had about an hour to climb it and get back to the coach, so we walked as fast as we could. The hill is over 500ft tall, but the climb was worth it, as the views were amazing.   urlLink    By this time, I only had one small photo left, so I took a picture of one of the stunning views. We could see for miles! We raced back down into Glastonbury, and just before we got onto the coach to go back home, I raced into the bookshop, and bought Geoffrey Ashe's book  urlLink 'Mythology of the British Isles' . I then raced back outside, went over to him, and got it signed! The message inside reads "Best wishes Geoffrey Ashe Aug/04". Heh.  He hasn't seen the film of King Arthur yet, so I couldn't ask him about it.  The journey home wasn't too bad, but again, I'm really tired. Luckily the weather held out!
