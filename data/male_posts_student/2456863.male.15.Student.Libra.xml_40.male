Oh and if you're a girl, DON'T READ IT!  you probably wouldn't understand the guy.  Anyway, after that i'm gonna read "God's Debris," another book i'm borrowing from jamie.  They're both short, thats why i'm reading them.  If they were longer I'd be like, um I don't think so.  I found this article on msn called "Can Friends be Lovers?"  And it was really funny.  Um lets see I should finnish my homework now.  Later
