I think a thousand of them held in the Iraqi prison should be given 24 hour[s] -- a trial and executed. I think they need to be shown that we are not going to roll over to them ... Instead of putting joysticks, I would have liked to have seen dynamite put in their orifices and they should be dropped from airplanes ... They should put dynamite in their behinds and drop them from 35,000 feet, the whole pack of scum out of that jail."  The next day Savage added that Arabs were "racist, fascist bigots," and purported to speak for a majority of Americans regarding the war. He offered several all-American solutions to our problems in the Middle East.  "Right now, even people sitting on the fence would like George Bush to drop a nuclear weapon on an Arab country. They don't even care which one it would be. I can guarantee you -- I don't need to go to Mr. Schmuck [pollster John] Zogby and ask him his opinion ... The most -- I tell you right now -- the largest percentage of Americans would like to see a nuclear weapon dropped on a major Arab capital. They don't even care which one...  "I think these people need to be forcibly converted to Christianity ... It's the only thing that can probably turn them into human beings."  So, you call it.  Wack job or shithead?  Or both?  Probably both.  Savage, you get to hang out with Inhofe and Limbaugh in the "I like to prove the terrorists are right about us" lounge.  Congrats, fuckwad.  Way to continue to be an embarrassment to your country and your species.   urlLink Full Disgusting Story
