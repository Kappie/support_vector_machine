Yesterday was a week from when I handed in my resume and cover letter to Music Mart. I think I'll call them early next week.  Hmm...  I wonder if anyone accually reads this... Don't be shy, leave a comment. I promise it won't make me hate you even if it is mean.  Yeah so I'd have to say I like Jake Gyllenhaal's preformance in Donnie Darko and October Sky more then The Day After Tomorrow, not that he sucked or anything.  28:6:42:12  Have you ever seen pulp fiction? I've heard it's good and I want to see it but someone already checked it out and I am too Lazy and poor to go rent it. I also have to see Fight Club, and about a million other movies... Is there anything in theators right now worth seeing?  .... Oh Yeah I have to see Dodgeball.  Spider-Man 2 looks good and got a great review in Rolling Stone.  What do you think about White Chicks.  Personally I don't think its going to be all that great.  It just looks like another movie full of racial jokes and cheap humor.  Well, I don't have to go anywhere, but I'm done here so I'll say farewell for now... I may be back sooner than you think.   -Dan V
