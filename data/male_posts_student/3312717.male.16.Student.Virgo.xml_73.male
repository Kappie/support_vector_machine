I want one.  I got a .22 from my Grandpa and went to find some bullets so I can shoot rats and cats in my neighborhood, maybe Mattson's windows.  I also looked at fishing stuff.  But the time I was there was very wasteful.  But it is a very nice pond, and I may have to check out there free fishing clinic's, you know- for my brother.  Work was very slow, and it took 6 hours to do all the prep we needed.  Rad wants to fight me- or box me.  He just got new gloves and wants to try them out.  Sometimes I want to hit him and it would be fun if I, in the unlikely chance of me winning, did kick some ass.  I have monday off, so we should do something.  I kind of want to play tennis, but I also want to sit in my basement with a 12 inch sub, bowl of you know what, and brewsky.
