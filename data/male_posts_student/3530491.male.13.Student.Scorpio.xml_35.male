It's starting to cool down. On a completely unrelated note: They Might Be Giants is the most awesome band ever. Go to their  urlLink site  and check them out. Now for something completely different:  urlLink Open Office  ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's so cool. Think of it this way: Take Microsoft Office (which is okay) multiply it by 10, add billions of cool features and usability, plus, THE ABILITY TO SAVE THINGS AS PDF FILES FOR FREE, and you've got the best thing ever to come out of open source programming since Linux! YAY! It's fun to subvert Adobe and Microsoft in one sitting (though I do have to say, when you compare Win 98 to to Win XP, Win XP is really much more stable since they used NT technology instead of MS-DOS technology (I very rarely have the problem of the computer freezing, and I haven't had any Fatal Error messages or Blue Screens of Death yet.) So, kudos to that.). Anyway, that's that. Oh, and before I forget: I've become a trial member of a clan! Yeah. I've become a trial member of the Desert Combat clan  urlLink Rebel Resistance  (their symbol is -)RR(- for all of y'all), which means that I get to wear their clan tag for 30 days while they check me out (they've already said that I'm really good despite my age, so'll they'll probably take me in.), but I don't get to play in any TWL matches or scrims (well, I expected that.). So, I'm really happy. That's it. Wait... No it isn't. I've read a lot of Douglas Adam's Hitchhikers Series (I'm on the 4th book, "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"). I'm probably going to finish it and "Catch-22" when I go to the beach from the 26th of July to the 30th of July. That means you'll have to pray that Max and Fred start posting again while I'm gone *hint* *hint*. See ya later in the week. Yeah... Bye.
