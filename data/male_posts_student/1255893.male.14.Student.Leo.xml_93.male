Which I will add to and change frequently, seeing as it's easier to posrt lyrics than ideas and thoughts for me. And instead of putting them in blog form (which can sometimes get annoying) I'd rather have them on the side. Blah. Well anywho, seeing as I know our new teachers ill start off the school year by asking "how was you're summer break?" or "what did you do over the vacation?" I figure I'll get a head start.   This has been my most active summer. Which is pretty sad seeing as I hardly went out with friends at all. The kick off to the whole thing would have to be the best part. It all started about a few weeks into summer. I had already gone out to the movies with Johnny and told him about a lot of crap. A few days afte that I started bouncin off the walls since I could finally tell people I had a gurlfriend and  not be lying to them. A month after vacation started Ave came back from Polluck pines for a visit. Me, her and Kaitlyn went to sherman oaks castle park along with my lil sis. I'd say that was one of the best days I had all break. I went to the movies a few times. I got to see finding nemo, pirates of the caribeen, charlie's angels, tomb raider, I think there's some more. I had a few adventures along the way. right after graduation me, ave, kaitlyn, and cathy all went to the mall. We stuck around a while, bought useless crap, ate pretzels, and in the end said good bye for a while. It was about 1 pm and I was gonna meet haress, roy, johnny, chris, and a few other people to watch bruce almighty. As it turned out they were gonna meet there at 12 and i thought they said 1. I ended up walking home from the mall. which wasn't all bad cus i got some nachos from 7-11, and i like walking.......... even if it was about a mile or so. My next excursion came a month later. I was gonna meet ave and her friend to see finding nemo. I decided to take the bus. Only the damn thing took a freakin long time. I was about ready to run passed nordhoff when it finally came. What I didn't know was that the bus turned on nordhoff, leaving me to quickly get off and run to the theatre place. I bought my ticket hoping to meet the 2 of them inside. Though to my surprise (or i guess you could say i had a heart attack) they were actually in line next to me. At the end of the movie Ave's mom offered me a ride home but i decided to stay a bit longer and take the bus home. I also wanted to play crazy taxi high roller. Well The bus pisssed me off so once again i ended up walking home. Not quite as far  as walking from the mall, but tiring none the less. I didn't get to see as many of my friends as I had planned. I saw mostly my cleveland people. Let's make a list shall we? there was ave, kaitlyn, cathy, kelley, johnny, jose, roy, jason, david, juan, jose (another one), gary, aaron, umm ....... i think I'm missing a few. If I am im sorry, but my brain isn't exactly at 100% right now. There were other high notes as well. My brother and I finally got our 64 back! I've been having fun creating a few of my friends as wrestlers. Yeah I know you're gettin pissed (at least a  few of you) but it's for my entertainment, not yours. I got xp installed on my computer. yay! My computer has sound now as well. Tae kwon do's been keepin me busy and a lil more fit. and I think that's pretty much it. Of course there were rough patches along the way, but why focus on them? Well anywho, I know it's been hard reading this all so I guess I'll stop now. L8R.
