Okiedokie, that's not entirely interesting. Let me see... nope, life is particularly unthrilling today. I didn't manage to get up in any decent sort of time this morning so I missed the bus again. So it's been a fairly normal sort of a day so far. Been thinking about things, never you mind what, I don't have a big internet diary thing with which to display my thoughts so I guess you'll all have... to.... oh, wait.  Mostly I've been thinking about the different people I've had a 'crush' (hate that word, it's an ugly word) on. In general, up until this year, they've been a little younger than me or my age. Suddenly as I leapt into Y11... well, to start off with I wasn't really particularly interested in any women, moreso just moping (see earlier archives (150+ posts ago is good ^_^). After that brief bit of minor asexuality I've been 'interested' mostly in people in the L6. I doubt this is onset liking older women because in general it's half a years difference or only a little more. I don't know whether it says something about my maturity level or the maturity level of the L6 peeps I meet but it seems that in general I'm more compatible with older people. It could be argued that this is a bad move for me - it takes more to get someone to 'like' you if you're younger than them than if you're older than them (experience tells me this). But still. Observationalism.  Nächste Montag habe ich meine Deutsche Mundliche Prufung. Und kann ich nicht Deutsch sprechen. Aber meine sprechen Sprache ist viel besser als meine Schreibug. Ich kann nicht viel auf Englisch schrieben, und so es ist sehr schwer für mich auf Deutsch.  If any Deutsch-a-phones can understand that I'll be v. pleased.  AH MY GCSES START IN 2 WEEKS... SHI...  Love, Jon Roskilly
