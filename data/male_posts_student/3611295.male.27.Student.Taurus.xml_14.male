We all know that last summer was characterized by late nights at dennys and a lot of flaking of certain members, and the enlightening that drinking syrup is so unhealthy. Well this year promised much more with new addition lisa and the reintroduction of Al to the gang. This seems to be al's summer of sin more than anyones due to the shortage of jack daniels in the san gabriel valley! Joe looked as if he was gonna committ to some grapplin then came up with a case of "the runs" that seemed to have all gone away now. Sr. crippler (edgar) may have a hairline fracture in his forearm area, from what may i ask? The Forearm is used for many a task, and i still have paris so rest up my friend. Keep it up guppyz. We all know of certain members slip ups but has another guppy slipped? A certain birthday boy was supposed to go with parents to dinner, but did he really????? Another shout out to guppy member luke who has on more than one occasion sprung for a good meal and has made several apperances this summer. Also, adrian has also made several apperances from the hard work of orange selling (JK dude). So props to the crew for a great summer so far. Lets keep it goin this friday with a matinee viewing of Anchorman, and a newport trip on wednesday to do some gool ol kayacking. Lisa better wear a 2 piece!  On another note, we have regained contact with minnow liz voshall. Liz has been on hiatus in australia doin good person work. She has returned to the area, well i guess the united states is the area, but will be spending probably the rest of the summer in Maine. Ya i dont know whats in maine either. Anyway, she says whats up to everyone and still has sweet sweet dreams of joes sweet touch........  --Phantom Hands (g-Unit)
