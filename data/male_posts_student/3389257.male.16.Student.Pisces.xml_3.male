No matter. I shall be back to normal. Soon. Descent. Beginning to wonder whether I have the right spelling of the right word. Is descent as in it's good or falling? No matter. Zoom out Camera man. Listening to "am I missing" by dashboard, it is mighty good. Buy their album also. I do believe that this is not a good choice. Moving. Bullshit. I don't want to leave you all. Ever. Just written a pretty awesome set of lyrics. I don't think I'll ever get to use them. I'm always second rate. Or it feels that way. Back to masking the way I really feel by short sporadic sentences. I would share my lyrics. but you'd jip them you thiefing munchkins you. Umpa-lumpas even. With your orange skin and your green hair. You make me sick.
