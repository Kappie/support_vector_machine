Seeing as how I finished Spring Session at the University of Alberta, and mighty successfully too!, you'd think that I'd enjoy the 16 days I had off until Summer Session started up.   Pfffttt...!   Though it was only for 8 days, I've been out by Lloydminster working for  Tri-City Drilling  to stockpile a little extra cash. It was 8 shifts of graveyard work, from 19:30-07:30, so my internal clock is entirely out of whack.  Sleep, need sleep soooo badly.   Currently: Amazed that Blinky 2.0 is still alive after not being fed all this time!
