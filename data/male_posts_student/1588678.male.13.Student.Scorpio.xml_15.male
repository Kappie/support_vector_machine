Boy, I tell ya, Dave Navarro plays hella good guitar. Since I only bought it a couple of days ago, I've been listening to it day and night! It's that good! I must say, I'll have to put it on my Top 10 Favorite CDs. So, if you have some extra cash go out and buy this CDs. It ROCKS!!! The CDs called, "Strays," and the band is called Jane's Addiction. So go out and buy it you monkey!
