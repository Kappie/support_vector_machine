I'm goin to Geyser Falls tomorrow. I can't wait for that.        School is soon to start back. For me it starts back on Tuesday. I can't believe it's my last year. Now I just have to start thinking about colleges.         Me and Tiff. J earlier were aruging over who got to say bye last over i.m. haha. Also I talked to Tiff H. I kinda thought she was mad at me for something earlier, but i'm glad she isn't. I talked to Justin, Nikki, and some others. Well, i'm gonna go and i'll c-ya later. -Fly With Christ
