       
      I have a friend who left to go on a two-week long mission trip to Costa Rica today.  Actually, I have several friends who are going on this mission trip, but one is, shall we say, more notable than the others.  When she gets back, I will try to post some information about her experiences on the trip, and possibly some info from my other friends who went on said trip.  Until then, I will be praying for their safe trip and return.  More later...
