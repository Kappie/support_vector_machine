Of course, family numbers I saved. But as far as friends..... All I saved is all I need and the only ones who really mattered. Maria, Sonny, Lisa, and Veena are the only numbers that I need and the rest I deleted. No more numbers of ex's, no more numbers of fans, no more numbers of people that I don't need. My life will be just fine. Sometimes solitude is all you need and a couple of friends. I'll eventaully meet new people, but atleast I deleted the clutter in my life. This is a big step for me since I usally hold on to things.
