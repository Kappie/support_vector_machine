England beat Iceland 6-1 in their final warm-up game before Euro 2004 starts (Lampard, Rooneyx2, Vasselx2, Bridge)  But the Flames lost 3-2 in 2nd overtime, so its going to Game 7 in Tampa Bay. Bahbahbah.  And this...heh. I'll leave you to make your minds up about this...  Eli (11:08 AM) :  so did you enjoy condemning yourself to hell? Ben (11:22 AM) :  you mean "how was work"? Eli (11:23 AM) :  Yes. Eli (11:24 AM) :  I certainly do. Ben (11:24 AM) :  it was ok. Eli (11:24 AM) :  suure it was Ben (11:24 AM) :  suprisingly enough, I didnt meet anyone with horns and/or tails wanting to devour my soul Eli (11:25 AM) :  they already have Ben (11:25 AM) :  oh? Eli (11:26 AM) :  yup Ben (11:26 AM) :  funny. thought I would have noticed something like that Eli (11:28 AM) :  nah
