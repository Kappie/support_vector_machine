I opened up a new bank account today. I am not to solicitous to throw more of my money down a spiralling hole called "My Present Bank Account."  Oh well, I talked to the directors at my school - I'm fucked. I am having to work out deals and press intensely. I feel like a failure, a disappointment to myself. I couldn't make it happen, but there is hope and it starts on Saturday.  This week has just been a crap heap. I need a bigger shovel to dig myself out of this hole. I wish I could just through out all my obligations, get a backpack and travel, meet up with old friends and have a cup of Joe. It sucks to feel this way - you know what I mean. But it will pass and everything will be golden once again. It's all a big fucking circle. The burden of being an adult. A guy at work said it was harder to be a kid, you don't have the freedom, you can't make your own decisions. Well - I say bullshit. Being an adult is harder - you HAVE TO make your own decisions - there is still no option.   I think I'll go play some tennis this evening. James (the head net admin at work) just bought a boat. Soon I will be going to the lake for some water skiing! That will mos def rock!
