This post is going to be similar to the good old days when my posts were about me and my keen observations.  Hopefully the site won't lose popularity now (we came in at about 100 visitors last week alone).  So the old man just went on a good old fashioned buying rampage and brought home a new printer.  The Canon i9900 with 4800 x 2400 dpi, borderless printing, and eight, count 'em eight ink tanks.  It shakes the table when it prints.  I remember our first color printer shook when it printed too, but it had a ribbon instead of ink cartridges.  Oh, technology!  I bow to your splendor!  Onward...  I hope you are all gearing up for the Summer Olympics.  Here is my thing with the Olympics, I only like the sports with real winners.  Sports where any old Joe can say, "He won."  None of this gymnastics crap with "points."  Don't get me wrong, I have lots of respect for gymnasts and they really are athletes.  However, I like a sport where the "judge" holds a stopwatch, ruler, or makes sure the guy's foot didn't touch the bar.  Remember that scandal with the Canadian judge at the Winter Olympics?  Where she gave some really bad figure skaters high marks?  That garbage would never happen if I had my way.  Olympic sports should be objective.  You know what else should be objective?  Journalism.  Today's news sources seem to be blurring the line between journalism and commentary.  I think we can all agree on that.  Some more than others, but at some point we all have to ask ourselves, "Am I watching news, or opinion?"  And that question needs to be asked objectively as well.  When it comes time for you to vote, whether it be this election or one in the future, please, please, please, get informed.
