I wish school is here, so that my mind would be much intellectually active. Get to see all of them again. But we're not even planning anything this June hols, no mood as they say. Don't blame them or anything, maybe their focusing on their own stuffs. This blog has really become a little derelict. No doubt about that, but I've come to the point when I don't care. Knowledge is evolutionary, progressive, but for me it has come to a halt. Here's a little something which I wrote.............     Someone wrote:     no 1 is saying that things cant 'evolve'. mayb the earth, animals do evolve over time. BUT when we talk abt evolution, the most important thing is not did the earth evolve but how did human come about! the common picture in people's mind is how apes eventually evolve into human. and that is what scientists re trying to convince the world.   the debate is not whether earth can evolve or not, the debate is did ape evolve to a man.   i thank God that some of u re very intellectual n like science very much BUT u re missing the picture when u think that christians re trying to deny science.   i dun really care whether did giraffe get such long neck due to it evolve over time bcos of environment. i only care is the world trying to deny the existence of God by labellig human as a result of random n natural selection and evolving.   sorry to insult anyone but i really think this thread is a waste of time. we shld ask ourselves what is the spirit behind a theory, a philosophy.   eg why is racism bad? the natural answer wld be it's not fair to put 1 race down. but if we think further, it is a spirit or a force to make people believe that God didnt make everyone equal and that is an insult to God's character.   why is communism bad? the natural answer wld be no freedom, people re robbed of the motivation of life. but if we think further, the biggest problem of communism is it deny God. so EVEN if there re 101 gd things abt communism, as long as if it denys God, there's no pt trying to convince me to subscribe to it.   so for those intellectuals (which i am not), for a moment, try to be more spiritually minded and see beyond ur scientific facts and ask yourself is it really of God or of the devil or is there a real subtle driving force behind such things.   if not mayb u guys can go to some science-related forum instead and find ur mental stimulations. this forum doesnt provide such a platform to do so.      I wrote:    lol, about whether the biggest problem in communism is denying God is very much arguable. Political systems have to be analyzed on a case by case basis. Well, really, what do I have to say about what you say. Things are getting about strongly-worded here so I'll try to smile  and keep things happy lol.   Well well, ok, don't worry christians are not the ONLY people who hate intellectual arguments. The common gripe is that well, you can argue the whole day but get to no where, so what's the point, just sit back and relax. Well, if everybody "sat back and relaxed", the computer you're using, the light bulb that's lighting up your room. These inventions are based on scientific principles, and these scientific principles were argued.   Take electricity for example, if say, at that time everyone believed that electricity is produced when God is angry and he sends lightning bolts down and stuff, then this guy came and tell them about electricity, and electromagnetic induction, well, an argument would ensue. Sometimes, its fortunate if a conclusion is formed in one generation, sometimes it takes a a few hundred years to formulate a sound scientific principle, after a few hundred years arguing over the same thing.   That's how human beings managed to develop because of this. It is because no one saw how "pointless" it was, or maybe some did but they kept on. Arguments cause us to learn, to think. And to ask us to stop arguing is basicallt asking us to cease learning and thinking. Simple as that. Learning is not through reading books, learning is developmental, its progressive, evolutionary, i can say. The human race progressed not because it read old books, but it has written its own books. It argued, modified what is seen as "common" knowledge. And this process naturally caused disagreements, but these disagreements are essential and are part of the learning process.   Why enclose yourself in a box? The elderly in Russia still do hold communist beliefs, if communism was more widespread, can we win the world through denying communism. Communism in this sense is rhetorical, similar in approach to christianity, it would not be difficult to change their beliefs. But what about humanism and darwinism? It is intellectual in nature, and christianity should approach it in an intellectual manner imo.   These people don't just randomly and abitrarily believe in Darwinism, but they have a REASON to do so. All the more we should give them reasons to believe in christianity and not in darwinism. Sure, you may say that God is a God of faith. But really, if God is a God of faith, why do handle hot objects carefully, why did God gave us a mechanism of pain to avoid us malhandling our body. Why can't God just take away the pain and heal us right away?   Sometimes, human beings look for a little novelty sometimes lol, God give you pain to stop you from hurting yourself, and you ask why can't God just heal you instead? And if God does it the other way round, we complain why can't God give us a mechanism to stop us from hurting ourselves. Faith doesn't mean that we are devoid of reason.   The reason why I started this thread in the first place is that i hope that christians would be more aware of intellectual threats to our faith and how to adequately counter them. I'm a little not that "christian" in my stance mostly because that's what I believe but also partly I hope that this thread would not be filled with "yes-mans", denouncing the "spirit of evolution", and when our friends argue with us about our faith, where evolution is concerned, what do we do? Pray in tongues and cast the "spirit of evolution" out of him? Well.......you can try.......   And regarding communism. Just because it denies God doesn't mean we totally deny it. Someone once said, "A dumb man believes everything he sees, the clever man believes half of what he sees, the wise man knows which half to believe". There are good points in communism such as a colletive identity, nationalism, and egalitarianism. These good points can be brought forward and applied to maybe even Singapore.   The world is filled with half-truths, sure the bible is true. But does the bible give us insight on how to run a country? Insight on scientific principles? Not really, maybe for the former, yes. But, really it is at best a few chapters of it. Marx or Freud's books would serve as better "manuals" whether you buy their theories or not. Since the world is filled with half-truths and half-goods, why not take the good out of this and that, and apply it to yourself.
