I went to Honk! today, musical about the ugly duckling produced by my school. They all did a great job. That's about all that happened today although I did watch a good movie with Kevin Bacon, called " urlLink Stir of Echoes ," a good creepy movie with a nice, round-about ending.  That's about all, so I'll post a nice quiz for you all.  Please leave comments.  It makes this all feel worthwhile.   Which Biblical Hero Are You?   I'm  JOSEPH .  Self-assured and proud of it, I'm leadership material through and through. Hey, can I help it if other people think I know it all? I do!
