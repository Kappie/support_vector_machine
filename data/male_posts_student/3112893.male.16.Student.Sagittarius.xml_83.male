It's not like they had to the change the hard drive or that the problem that it had had anything to do with the hard drive, but you never know with those people at the Apple Repair Center thing. Naturally, but unfortunately, they didn't give me a better motherboard than the one that was in it. The problem with the machine was on the video card which is one with the logic board, literally. So, when the video card goes down, the whole logic board needs to be replaced. It's dumb, I know. I'm sure that Apple's heard of modular design, but I guess they have their reasons.  In any event, I have my ol' ME 262-A back from Texas and it's working just fine. I was so happy after getting a ride to Newton (via Needham) to pick it up, that I gave the box a big hug and kiss as soon as the lady at the DHL place passed it over the counter. Grin.  I'll write a post about what's happened today, including the drive to the DHL place, a little later tonight, I think... But for now I'll just stick with this.  Welcome back, ME 262-A.  That is all. -- Feanor
