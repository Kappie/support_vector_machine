Esp tt day was e day to go P.Ubin. Haiz, e Sec.1s all like vv slack liddat, can tget things moving fast. N also my Sec.3 ncos, also not tt fierce enough. Rem, e time @e beach, e sec 1s r juz too slow, so i knock them down, but the effect wasnt immediate n so i hav to say another time. When i said it 4 e 2nd time, i was afraid tt the sec.1s would not listen n will hav some kind of rebel attitude lor, also scared tt sec.1s r not afraid of my power. But lucky they seemed to be like follow my instructions.  I still can rem tt evening, when some grps r waiting to go 4 their bath, they were quite noisy n 1 of my sec.4 cant control them. But my apperance made the sec.1s kept quiet~~ This reminds me of my Sec.2s when they were under me last yr, they also like this yr sec.1s, saw me then start to tell each other 'Shhh.. Shhh..' one. Haiz. At e 1st day of camp, 1 sec.1 sprained his wrist in e morning, n so the sec.3s let him take a rest. Later in e afternoon @ e AV room he suddenly cried becoz of his pain, i wonder how he can tahan e pain 4 so long... Regarding their trip to Ubin, i felt tt they were vv lucky, becoz of our T.O Mr Tay, e security guard @ the NPCC Campsite let us in to let the sec1s to c the np campsite. For all my years in np, i can onli step into e campsite when we hav our ATC ther, if not don tink of even entering. Anyway, my 2 yrs of ATC were camped @ the old campsite, n the new site was built abt 2 yrs ago... On e last nite of e camp, tt was e 1st time in my life i had not slept 4 24 hours! E CIs, HO, Mr Low n I were at the staff lounge toking craps n also abt the DC visit lor.
