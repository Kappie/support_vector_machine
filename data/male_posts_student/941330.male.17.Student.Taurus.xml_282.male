WHICH IS THEREUPON LIT INTO ITS OWN TOWERING FLAMING INFERNO. HOPEFULLY WITH TIM KAWAKAMI AND SKIP BAYLESS'S SMOLDERING BODIES INSIDE. MMMM. I MEAN, OWWW. IT BURNS.  erm, well here i am, in july of 2004, a little over three months from the start of the new nba season and two weeks from an all-nba third-team destruction derby that i like to call the olympics, and already i am energized, hungrily anticipatory, and just generally jacked for some yummy roundball action. not to mention completely, albeit ambivalently, devastated to what has happened to my precious orlando magic, my first and only true basketball love.  in the span of about oh, a month give or take, the young, raw, but highly potent young group of individuals that comprised the core of what was once south florida's premier nba franchise was utterly dismantled ... and for what? a ball-hogging wannabe point guard, an undersized slasher, an often-lethargic looking long-range specialist, a defensive stopper allergic to scoring, and a passive shot-blocker.   thank god for john weisbrod.   crap move #1: throwing away zaza pachulia to the wolves/bobcats/bucks.   the unrealized talent of this young man from georgia (the country), who with practice had the potential to be a great post-up threat with good hands, was simply tossed by the wayside with just about no compensation. just around what we figured when pachulia started bringing his la-z-boy to the bench for naps while steven hunter turned the ball over three times a minute and andrew declercq fouled out three times a minute.   crap move #2: you know god-damn-fucking what.   WHY. WHY. WHY DID FUCKING JOHN WEISBROD THINK HE COULD PUSH TRACY MCGRADY AROUND AND TELL HIM HE WASN'T WANTED AND THAT HE HAD TO LEAVE HIS HOMETOWN. general manager john weisbrod can think he's a great personnel manager, having spent roughly a decade managing some no-name hockey team, but he's never dealt with an absolute talent like t-mac. and as my fellow weisbrod-whipper  urlLink kilgore t. schutz  (lovely name) loves to point out, YOU DON'T TREAT YOUR FRANCHISE PLAYER LIKE SHIT. you see jerry buss in los angeles taking off his pants and bending over just right for kobe bryant and his 7-year maximum contract, and then you see JOHN FUCKING WEISBROD. anyway, orlando loses t-mac, tyronn lue (aka the man with more technical fouls than assists), and juwan howard (aka the man who magically learns how to shoot in the fourth quarter). and what do we get? steve francis (aka "the franchise," aka a bald allen iverson with no steals), cuttino mobley (in short, he's short), and kelvin cato (a man who would rather get an inlay than an inlet pass).   crap move #3: trading away drew gooden for tony battie.   first, the sidenotes: dumping steven hunter on the cavaliers' doorstep is good. the ONLY good. now, giving away our athletic second-round pick anderson varejao (who had an interesting upside) is stupid. getting two future second-round picks (in 2005 and 2007) from a future contender in cleveland (meaning they will be late picks) is stupid. AND GIVING AWAY DREW GOODEN IS REALLY AMAZINGLY STUPID. mmm, caps lock. this means that in the end, we traded t-mac's good friend mike miller and got deshawn stevenson and tony battie in return. WHAT THE SHIT IS THAT. stevenson still can't shoot ... wait a second ... neither can battie. but it's ok because, in the immortal john weisbrod's words, tony battie "is a super high character guy." not just high, but super high. great. who cares if we picked up a guy who can't really ball worth shit as long as he's loyal and won't bitch when johnny davis again screws orlando in the asshole like he did with philadelphia.  i just hope orlando finds a way to be good. but until then -- for me at least --there's always t-mac. in houston. till the "end [of his] career." NOOOOOOOOOO
