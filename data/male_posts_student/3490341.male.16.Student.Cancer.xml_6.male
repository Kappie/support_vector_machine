Frasier has been one of my favourite sitcoms of which my reason for choosing this specific sitcom coming for my likeing of the brilliant sitcom cheers. My brother always liked Happy days but i always found the wit andcharacter of cheers more apealing. Cheers did not develop the character of frasier as far as many would have wanted but with his moving to Seatle saw him faining a sitcom of his own, of his own style. We are now lacking sitcoms in this modern age where the actors perform infront of a live audience. This is what gives the show a freshness with every episode as the actors are not playing to a camera (i know they are but in their minds they are not), ,they are playing to the audience which gives a feeling of truth to the performance. I was very sad to see friends leave because i can probably say there isn't an episode that i haventwatchedbut I am not wholely sad to see frasier go as much of its life on telivision was lost because of curfew. I am not saying that i want the sitcom to end but sometimes it is for the sitcom's good, as it is better to have a good ending (like that of blackadder that sticks in everyones minds) than to drag on losing all the fans it had gained throughout the years. Anyway I was saying about how frinds will become boring because of the amount of times each episode has been repeated, but with frasier i will be happy to watch repeats for many years to come as, for one i havenrt seen many of the older episodes, and two i dont think i have seen any episode more than once so it will not lose its new and fresh appeal for many a year. I hope that frasier will take up the 6 o clock spot of friends on channel 4 at some point as it would be a movement forward that wouldnt feel out of place as frasier has run alongside friends for many a year. Wellthe finale episodes are about to start so i'll wrapup this long-winded waffling post that has managed to spread one point over god knows how many lines.  oh,ive just realised when frasier finnishes (+10min) I'll be sixteen.wow. Oh yes the other thing i was going to add was that the pictures on the site are going to be from my holiday in Amsterdam for next couple of weeks. Hope you enjoy.
