I haven't actually read it yet; there'll be more on it after the meeting tomorrow.  At MUN, my resolution won, barely.  The vote was 22 yeas and 18 nays, with 22 abstentions.  No one bothered to look at the MUN site (http://www.smetna.com/mun/) so they didn't get copies and just voted with sociable Matt K-K.  But seriously– the same number of yeas as abstentions?  That's horrible.  I'm glad Will is ruling with more of an iron fist.  I hope he fails a lot of the people who don't do anything or who barely do anything (that means you, Loren).  I'm finally through with that horrible khemysthree test!  Yes!  I thought I did pretty well, but I probably spelled my name wrong or used the old system of elements starting with Fi, Wi, Ea, Wa, and Lo (Fire, Wind, Earth, and Love, all noble gases).  But you've already heard those jokes ('cept for maybe Julia Kalow– speaking of which, don't you have anything better to do than read grubby little punk sophomores' blogs?).  Here's the tentative Matrix plan: Saturday, November 8 (this Saturday), we'll go to lunch at Cabot's (haven't eaten there in a while; aren't you tired of KFC?), then maybe the noon or 12:30 showing of Revolutions in Framingham, then maybe go to John or Richie's house (this could be in the beginning too) for GameCube/Monopoly.  I don't know who can come yet, besides me, John, and Loren, so tell me if you're free that day.  We'll probably have gotten tickets beforehand so we won't have to wait; it is opening weekend, after all.  Here is a couple of quotes that you'd know if you've read one of my profiles recently, the one from my "Academics" user account:  "I'm doing a white guy, I don't know if he's Jewish or not." ---Steph Kaplan  "I wish I had a white female Jewish aunt." ---Craig  Also, here's a passage from the very funny Steve Martin's "Pure Drivel":  "Once in Hawaii, I had sex with a hundred-and-two-year-old male turtle. It would be hard to argue that it was consensual. I would like to apologize to the turtle, his family, the Kahala Hilton Hotel, and the hundred or so diners at the Hilton's outdoor cafe. I would also like to apologize to my loyal wife Karen, who had to endure the subsequent news item in the 'Also Noted' section of the 'Santa Barbara Women's Club Weekly.'"
