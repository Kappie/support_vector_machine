Well you know what? I'm not. I'm not even gonna say a single word about it. I consider myself too much of an intellectual to DEGRADE MYSELF by treating it to my UPSCALE COMMENTARY. I will just say one thing on the matter though, and to do so I will quote the great Bill Maher - "It IS absurd that Arnold Schwarzenegger is running for governor. We've just gotten used to it."   In other news, Wesley Clark announced last week that he is officially Democratic contender #10, and that's just fine with me. I, unlike many others, am not perturbed by the fact that the Dems' field is so crowded - debate within the group is the essence of democracy, and is what makes us different from the mindless, non-thinking Republicans. And I honestly don't really care who wins the primary (although I think John Kerry is the most well-rounded candidate and probably has the most serious shot at beating Bush) because I like all of the candidates and believe that Bush is fundamentally weak in every (yes I said EVERY) field. Are we any safer? Hardly. Is the economy any better? The thousands of unemployed in this country don't think so. Have we strengthened our international alliances? HA! Is our government smaller, less intrusive, and more fiscally responsible? Double HA! Have we cracked down on nations that support terrorism? No... Just ask the Saudi royal family. Have we found Osama or Saddam? Nope. But why does Bush still get to go to his campaign fundraisers and make millions of dollars for talking for fifteen minutes while the country is in this shape? Some things in this world are just deeply unfair.  And finally let me reiterate that despite the fact that Bob Ehrlich stood up at his little podium and gave some reassuring words about the flood damage in Maryland, I still loathe him. In fact, I loathe him so much that from here on out, he shall be referred to as Snot Boy. So when I start talkin' about Snot Boy's cockamanie slot machines plan for the state's budget, and Snot Boy getting away with illegally paying campaign volunteers on election day, you know what I mean.
