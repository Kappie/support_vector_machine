Unfortunately, they aren't as well known otside of Canada as other bands are. In my three years in the United States (in Manchester, New Hampshire, to be exact), I have heard more than my fair share of Rush songs on the radio, but a lot of these Rush songs came from their self-titled first album "Rush". Songs like "Working Man", "Need Some Love", or "Finding My Way" are more popular to the American public than songs like "Closer to the Heart", or "Spirit of Radio". After all evaluation and listening to the CD over and over again, I have come up with a possible solution as to why this came to be. It seems that there is a more bluesy rock n' roll feel to Rush's firtst album that really appeals to the American audience. The first album seems to have described Rush at that point in time, but not the next 29 years of their career up to the present. The common denominator to all this was John Rutsey.  Yes, John Rutsey, the man who pounded the skins for Rush during their 1974 release "Rush" and for the majority of the tour to support that record. The same John Rutsey that had left the band because as reports would have it, he was too fed up of it all. He was replaced by Neil Peart and well, as they say, the rest is history. Why are we picking on John Rutsey? The answer to this is that, we are not picking on John Rutsey, but rather we are looking into a parallel universe to see what direction Rush would have taken if Mr. Rutsey had not left the band.   In other to answer this, we must firstly ask "what did John Rutsey bring to the band?" John Rutsey was not a composer, like Neil Peart. He probably did not read as much as Neil Peart, which means that even if John Rutsey did write all the lyrics to the songs for Rush, they wouldn't be, for the lack of a better term, Rush-esque. They would most likely not be as creative as Neil Peart. Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson did try their to write some lyrics, but we see who the better lyricist is in the band... Neil Peart! What would also be missing is The amzing drumming skill that Neil Peart possesses. It wouldn't capture the imagination of many young musicians. To be honest, a lot of people listen to Rush because of their individual mastery of their respective instruments. I do believe in my humble opinion that the "Rush mystique" would not be around if Mr. Rutsey continued to be Rush's drummer.  So, what would it be like if John Rutsey had never left? If John Rutsey had never left, Rush would have been a bigger hit in the United States, but there would be nothing to set them apart from every other rock band. Due to this, their career would not be going strong in the year 2004 and they would never have had the icon status that they have now in their limited circle. In a way, they would turn out like one of the bands on VH1's Bands Reunited. They would be great then, but no one knows what they would be doing in the present. Most of all, if John Rutsey never left Rush, there would never have been a 2112, and because of that, we, the fans of Rush should thank John Rutsey for stepping down as Rush's drummer because if that hadn't happened, Rush would never have been what they are now, the greatest rock band ever!
