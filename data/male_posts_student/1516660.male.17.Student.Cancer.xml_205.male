They were generall okay lor. I found most of them easy. Physics was kinda tricky with SI units and call. But oh well!! I can manage. And oh my meow!!! Mrs Chew is leaving for Evergreen Secondary!! I heard she chose to leave on her own. I wonder if it is because of bad collegeas? OOO!! That means she could be my brother's Chem teacher! I wonder if she's gonna play the "bonus points" game with them!! If she's gonna be his Chem teacher, I can pass letters to her via my brother! O.o!!!!  Okay....went back, bathed, went online and ate lunch till 1pm. I went o Wendy's to play MahJong. Woah! Hands so itchy to play. Woah! Howver, the game became quite stale after playing for many many rounds. I stopped playing when the controller went bersek and I discarded one of my wanted tiles! Darn! After that, I joined Wendy to sleep in her room. Ha! She slept on the bed, I slept on the mattress on the floor. Ha! Slept till her mom came back, then she went to bath and this and that. We left her house at 3.15.   All of us met at Woodlands Control Station at around 3.30. Our group went up first, while the other is waiting for MeiYing's sister. Me, CQ, WQ sit at one side, while Wendy, Ping, Chun, Amanda and Janet sat the opposite seats. We chatted and talked and mooed and meowed. Heh. We alrighted at Marina Bay, then took a bus 400 to the restuarant.   Woah! We were there VERY early! Woah! We were joined by Hann later on. After some minutes of waiting around, we went into the restuarant and found that it was open.So, we decided to eat then. Each of us pays $12.   Everyone was like....woah. In a flurry to get things. I was very confused, so I didn't get anything. Hmm... meat was brought back first, so we fried meat to eat. Quite nice actually! They brought back crabs and prawns! Woah! They were really live (No wonder they call the restuarant Zheng Fa Huo Hai Xian (Cheng Fa Live Seafood) )!! Oh god! The prawns are alive and kicking! They struggled when we try to put them into the water!! HaHa!! So cute!   Woah! I find that hor, people don't like a lot of things i like, except for Hann. At my table, WQ and some cats don't like seafood. They took a lot a lot of french fries and chicken wings! Such a waste of money. Only Hann and me like sotong ar, cuttlefish ar, harms ar, vessels ar.... Hann even stole my sotong!!! My beautiful sotong!! Eating steamboat without these hor, is not called eating steamboat. Only cuttlefishes, sotongs, harms and other things complete "steamboat"! Even the boiled harms are nice to eat! The steam from the stock soup fogged up my glasses. My glasses are so oily!!   After that, me, Hann and CQ went to the arcade to play. Hann played the Para Para! Woah! He's so good at dancing Para Para wor! Moo meow! Ayiah....we flitted here and there, between the arcade and the restuarant. HaHaHa! We started to leave around 8, but in the end, we left at 8.30. Hm...we went to Orchard to see the Chistmas decos.  Woah! So spectacular! Never been to Orchard to see Christmas decos before leh! So cute the decorations! I love the hanging lights! We walked around and saw many buskers! Woah!! They then decided to go to Heeren to take NeoPrints. Woah! Took such a long time! Most of us were rushing back home. But we don't have the heart to tell them that we are going. Nobody does. So we waited like fools. Till Wendy and Clar came running out and we went back home. You shoulda seen WQ. He was madly rushing for the train. I foresaw that he couldn't catch the arriving train. And I was right. Stupid guy. What's the difference between catching a train then and catching a train 4 mins later? Anyway, we went back at, reached home at 11. It was pouring real heavily when I was going home. Oh god!  Okay....today hor, I went to East Coast Park for celebration. The choir is celebrating for us  We took bus 966 there. What a long journey! Then, we had to walk quite a fair bit to get to our shelter. Heh heh. Firstly, some of us went to the beach to play, while some rented bikes and skates. Those who went to the beach are those playing bikes/skates later. Oh...I treated Wendy today. HaHa! She spent about $12 off moi. Heh! Me, CQ were walking on the beach..getting our feet soaked. HaHa. We found stones and threw them into the water. Heh. After a while, we stopped and rest. Me, Ji and his sister went to the shelter to rest and wait for lunch. Then, HF and YJ joined us and we played daidee. After that, we played Cheat. HaHa. I almost ended up being the loser.   For lunch, we ate YiJuia's noodles. woah! So nice! JiJia is really good at cooking wor! After lunch, we went to rent bikes and skates. Me, SL and Joyce rented skates, while CQ, YT and SP rented bikes. Woah! This was my first time on skates! So fun and exciting. We made SP teach us to skate. I mastered it first, then Joyce. SL gave up after bout 50 minutes of trying. We were practising along a fence. I was supporting SL and helping Joyce. I got a cut there from a rusted nail, which made me ultra paranoid about getting tenatus. HaHa! We had difficulty walking up and down ramps. Heh. Joyce and I kept holding on to CQ  YT's bike. HeHe! I had fun skating!   After doing that, we went back to the shelter to play some games. Woah! First game was running and getting sweets from a pile of flour. We were kinda unwilling, but we gave in to their pleads in the end. Our group (Me, CQ, YT, SL and Joyce) won! Yay!! After that leh, we took photos. Then, it started to rain! Heavily! Oh my meow!! Mine and CQ's backs were wet, because our back is facing the direction of where the rain pours in. Oo my! First, we played truth or dare. For this, we played it kinda differently. We held hands, and if we wanted to kill people, we squeeze our partner's hand the number of the people the vicitim is sitting from us. I got Joyce and CQ as partners. When Joyce was murderer, she kept squeezing my hand. HaHa! Once, I was murderer, and I squeezed CQ's and Joyce's hands two times, killing HM and TW. Heh. So fun! After that leh, we played the game Zhong Ji Mi Ma. The loswer has to play Truth Or Dare. Joyce lost during once, but she refused to tell the truth, so she had to do a dare. The dare is to shout from far away: "I like XC!". She gave me a murderous stare when I suggested that. Heh heh heh!!   Hmm....we stopped the game after the rain let down. We ate some more food, then went home. We met Wendy and EC after thir bathing, and CQ they all went to change clothes. Me and Joyce took some seashells EC don't want and threw the rest away into the sea. HaHa! So fun!   After changing clothes and throwing away seashells, we went home lor. We took the bus at 5++. The rest stopped at a MRT station, while me and Wendy stayed on the bus till it reaches Woolands. We chatted about a lot of stuff. HeHe.   I reached home at about7.15, bathed and ate dinner (instant noodles). Ayiah. That's all lor. HeHe. Sorry for sounding rushed. I am kinda tired now. So, see ya tomorrow. Night blog!
