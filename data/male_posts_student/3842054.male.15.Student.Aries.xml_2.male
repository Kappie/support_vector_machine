Yesterday:  Ryan picked me up and we headed towards the train station to catch the 11.45 train. We get there, and right after we purchase our tickets, bam, train is 45-60 minuts delayed. So we call Alex (who is picking us up) and he offers to come pick us up. THat surprisingly went fast, and an hour or so later, we were in Alex's house. I have never been there before, but it was gorgeos. It doesnt look big from the outside, but its so deep, it seemed like it went on forever. Soon Kelsey showed up, then Brittney, and finally Katie Sadow. We just sat in Alex's very nice room and chatted until we realized it was 1:15, and we wanted to see Spiderman at 1:20. So, we run downstairs and hurridly get Mrs. Pouille to drive us 30 seconds to the Abacoa movie theatre. We make it just in time to get free popcorn, and get into the theatre while the previews are still showing. Again, i saw it and it was great again. Of course, they all loved it. Then we walked home which took like 20 minutes, and we decided to snack and play CRANIUM. That was interesting... First time ever, and brittney and i came in last, but thats ok. That took like 2 hours. Then the men took over and made hamburgers and hot dogs, which wernt that bad, but had to be cooked twice because Alex cant barbeque. Lol. Then we just went in the pool and chatted until one by one all the girls left. I liked that group alot, we had a LOT of chemistry and there was never a dull moment. We all got a long really well which was really good, and we all decided that Alex's house is now THE place to crash. Weekends will actually be fun now. Take the bus to jupiter with alex, get some people together, and spend the night. Its gonna be a great year.... Anyways, ryan, alex, and i played X box for like 1 1/2 hours, then we decided to go to bed. Ryan and I ended up sleeping on the same bed. (Dont worry, as far apart as possible, and this is a King size bed. ) This is all in Alex's guest suite. Alex slept on the floor on some couch pillows. So i didnt wnat to sleep under the same comforter as ryan, so alex and i went to find a blanket but all we could find is some towel thing. That didnt work and it was freezing, so i ditched that afer about an hour, and Ryan was still awake, which i didnt nkow. So i get under the covers, im comfortable enough with myself that i can do that... and then next thing i know, i wake up to Ryan pushing my arm off of him because i roll in my sleep and at some point i rolled over nad my arm was in his face. So that was interesting... we had a good breakfast this morning, and then we got driven to the gardens mall, and met Brittney. We jsut hung out. I bought the Story of the Year Cd. which is great. My mom met up with us and we got driven home. Pretty boring afternoon. Tried to buy warped tickets, but i have to wait for brittney to buy hers first. And now im typing and listening to Story of the Year, The Vines, and Sugarcult. WEll, heres the lyrics. Goodnight.   Story of the Year  Sidewalks   the bridge is all crumbled  the water soaks into rocks  that fell at the bottom of the road  (at the end of town)  The town we lived in  The memories shaken apart  from the weeds that grow  over the   sidewalks  running away from the streets we knew  sidewalks  like the time we thought was made for you   out on the front porch  watching the cars as they go by  (eighteen blue, twenty-one gray)  looking ahead  for the first time that we could drive  out on our own  to speed away  from the....   [Chorus]   all of the days have passed us by.  all of the sun is gone away.     I love that song... its really cool but im not gonna analyze it right now. Something about change and losing the past... Well, goodnight everybody.   Tommorows forcast : nothing special
