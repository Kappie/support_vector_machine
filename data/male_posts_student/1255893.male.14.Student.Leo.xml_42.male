But the wierd thing was that while i was taking this online test, one of the problems was to accosiate certain colors w/ a person you know. So when they asked what person you think of when you think of the color white, I said her name. When the test was over the results were as follows: whoever you chose as white is you're solute. I had no idea what this meant. So I looked it up, the definition was : " solute-completeness, solution." So that meant that this person was "my completeness/ what completes me" I thought this was the world's biggest coincidence. For one because she had said that. Also because she had asked who I liked , and I said if I had to pick it might be her. So I really don't know what to think now.                                                                    To that person- I will keep my promise of not telling anyone.                                   To any of my nosie friends- I will not tell you who it is.
