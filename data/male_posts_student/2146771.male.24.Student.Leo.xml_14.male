Most of you probably know what that is, but for those who don't, it's just a place where you can go and join discussions on a variety of topics.  Right now I only have a couple topics, but I will get more as the site grows.  So just click on the word  FORUM  in the upper left corner and a new window will open with my forum in it.  Then you can browse around or register as a member and start typing!    Also, I went last night to see the movie "The Passion of the Christ" and I really don't know what to say.  I have heard from two people that went with me already today and they both had great experiences at work to share about what Jesus did for them on the cross.  It is already an opportunity to share the Lord.  Yes it was "gory" but I honestly don't think it was "gory" enough.  I can't stand watching those surgery shows and I cringe when people talk about needles and blood, but I just grit my teeth and watched.  I honestly didn't even cry.  I feel that I didn't deserve to focus on my feelings, but to focus on what Jesus did for me.  I was in continuous prayer through the whole movie.  I was first angry at what people did to him, but then I remembered what Jesus said, " I lay down my life for you ."  He did it.  I was reminded of this greatly when, in the movie, Jesus dropped the cross where it was going to finally stand, and then he, himself crawled up on the cross.  Now I know that this is a movie, and is not EXACTLY what happened.  But I now understand that this was voluntary and not something "done to him" by the Jews or Romans.  It was done for us.  I thank the Lord for opening my eyes to what He did and allowing me to accept Him into my heart and life.  I pray you will do the same, whether you watch the movie or not, realize what Jesus did for you to keep you from eternal separation from him in hell, and accept the free ticket to heaven by accepting him as your savior today.
