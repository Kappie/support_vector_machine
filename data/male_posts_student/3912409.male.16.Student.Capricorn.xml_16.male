This is kinda what I looked like after leaving my house this morning:  urlLink     Lets see... I was undefeated yet again for tennis, which is a good thing because I have a tournament on saturday, AT 8:00!!! I've been getting up at noon almost everyday since school ended so getting up at 8:00 may be a bit of a challenge. Hopefully our club wont be do horrible again... we've came in last for the last couple years I think. I was watching Big Brother a little while ago and one of the guys said something that I thought was pretty funny, "There's no alliances allowed.... but mine" I thought that was pretty funny. Well not much else that I really did today, I mean I got up at noon, went to tennis at 1:15 and got home at 5:00 and collapsed on my bed. Which reminds me... HOLY JEBUS PIE!!! it was hot today... which also reminds me, Wes is sick today (HAHA!) so he was sleeping in bed all day, which he probably would have done anyway if he didn't have to go to tennis also.
