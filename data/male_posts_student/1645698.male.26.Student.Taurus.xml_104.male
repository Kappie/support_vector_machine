You know Dollface said this title as a joke, though, don't you?  It makes us sound like we're tripping on LSD or something.  Not that we don't  want  to sound like that - it just amuses me.  And now that the titles are up there I absolutely love the new layout.  Secondly, work puts you in touch with some fucking *scary* people.  This middle aged guy comes up to this girl I'm working with and says (and I pretty much quote):    They wouldn't have anything for my nephew here.  He's six, and he told me for his birthday he wants an X-rated film.  I asked his mom and dad and they say he caught them watching one and it gave him a mini hard on.  I asked him what he was gonna do with the girls at school and he said he'd rip their panties off.  I told him by ten he'd either be a father or in prison.  He said he wouldn't mind being in prison.  I told him he didn't know the first fucking thing about prison, then.  Now my brother, he's always in prison.  He acts like he likes it.  Once he stole some cigarettes in front of a cop - and the judge said he wasn't gonna throw him in prison.  "What'll you do if I kick you in the balls?" my brother asked.  "What'll you do if I smash your face?" the judge replied.  So my brother tried to kick him in the balls - and the judge told him for that he was sentencing him.  "Thanks," said my brother.  And then one time my sister got a call from a lady who says it's amazing how much better my brother looks with a haircut and how good he is in bed - "Don't worry," says the lady, "I won't return him.  I live in Jersey."  "I'm not worried," my sister says, "He can't come into NY without getting arrested and thrown in jail."    Like I said, scary people.  But that was the most interesting piece of work.  In other news, I'm single.  My life has been summed up at various times in the evening by Jewel's  Dreams  and Blink182's  Dammit .  Of course,  Dammit  kicks ass as a song anyway.  So Dollface, we need to drag Lady out and go guy watching.  Have a fling . . .see how much free stuff we can get from the male cashiers.  Do *something*.  Just don't get me near that guy who came into the store earlier tonight . .or his family. ^_^
