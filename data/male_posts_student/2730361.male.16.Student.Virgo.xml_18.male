Well hopefully everyone elses day went better than mine.  Oh and i had a question posted about my last post so i'll clarify it here. Yes you all read correctly and it was not a typo i said girlfriend. Now while i have only been out on 1 date with this girl i have been courting her since the begining of the school year so i feel comfortable calling her that. But the question was who am i "going out" with. The answer, for Lisa and anyone else who was curiosis, is that I am "going out" with Alycia Keller. She is going to be a junior this year she goes to my high school, lil ol' umatilla, and she is in band with me. So if in this upcoming year you see me walking around with a brunette that is probably her. Anyway im gonna go. TTFN. Ta Ta For Now.  P.S. Lisa i like your blog especially the picture but that expertise that is something i never knew about you.
