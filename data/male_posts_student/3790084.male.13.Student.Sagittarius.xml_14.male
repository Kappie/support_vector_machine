Maybe there's something bothering me... and yes i believe it is... maybe due to my nervous of tmorrow's medical checkup... I always think that i will no live long in this planet... I don't know since when i have this kinda of feelings... but t remembered that, i will hold on my mom's hands  everyday before i bid my day a goodnite coz  I am scared that I will no longer being able to see my mom... without her knowledge, i will silently cried to myself for no reason... but after so many years, i am still standing strong in this planet... hope tat my strength will beat all the evils that surround me coz I believe each of us in this world is being watch and guard by an angel before our Lord calls us back to where we were from... ^^
