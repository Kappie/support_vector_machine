This place is known as one of the few hot spots in Orange County that serves authentic ethnic cuisine and hooka pipes.  As Desiree can attest to (wink wink), hooka pipes are glorified Moroccan bongs.  Asides from getting my ears pierced in college, this is probably the third most "frowned upon" act I have ever done.  It was not the 0.005% mango flavoured tobacco high that I found most enjoyable, but the communal act of sharing a bong amongst friends.  I sat back and felt a sense of camaraderie, trust and openness.  Madness?  Absolutely not.  More like Hooka Camaraderie...just for that evening only.
