HOWEVER, it's extremely imperative for me to do well in the course and so I promised myself to study extra hard for the exam. Therefore there will be no new deviations ti'll next weekend (where there'll be a TON: I promise 'cuz me and a friends are going downtown just ot shoot) but in the meantime no new art and it's also highly unlikely I'll even be able to visit DA to comment... However, after Wednesday I'm totally free, so \m/>_
