I'd also like to point that that Hume does not completely throw out the idea of God in the  Dialogues , but simply poke wholes in the design argument. I don't remember what Philo's exact stance is, but I think it's agnosticsm.  Sometimes I wonder if I should have did the extra religious studies minor in addition to all the freaking degrees I have. I was 3 courses away from it.  Now playing: Virus 9 - "77 Threat"  I went to a talk on racism and Asians today. It was interesting, but I think the think I'd like to point out is that the professors' use of the word "racism" might not be quite right. While it is perhaps a word similar to what ancient Asians might have used, it does not necessarily mean that the same sense of race existed back then as it does now. Indeed there was difference based on social location based on power, and identity; however, was it phenotypical or cultural / ideological / political? I'm not an expert on ancient, or even modern Asian history, so I don't know. I only know that racism as we know it today is a construct of capitalism and slavery.  Now playing: Casualties - "Die Hards"  I have a lot of shit to do tomorrow morning.  ***
