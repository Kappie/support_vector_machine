Can you believe that?!  How *much* intelligence does it take to bubble something in properly???  I don't even want to know what I got anymore - if I can't write my own name and address, I certainly can't pass the stupid test.  Unfortunately, now that I've decided I really *am* just that stupid, they've gotten my actual address and are going to remail my scores.  *buries head in hands* In other news . . . um, I figured out how to delete posts all on my own.  It's kind of fun - so if anyone's been seeing posts that suddenly disappear five minutes later, that's just me reveling in my one discovered technological skill.  It's about the only thing I *can* do. And Conrad. . . you're definitely my favorite little brother ever.  Love you lots - maybe we should make a calendar and start marking down days? ^_~ Later!
