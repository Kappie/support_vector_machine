Now they are free, and welcomed to do whatever they what (except break the laws and stuff). I live in a cul-de-sac with 2 black families as neighbors (12 blacks). It seems like they are racists because if you even make the mistake of saying something like "heritage" or "culture", you're going to get your fucking ass whooped, like I expeirenced. And for some reason, you just can't fight back or insult them because I would label myself a "racist" and they would too. I'm a tough guy (not so much, but still) and an anarchist but I don't wanna feel like I'm in the KKK or anything. And maybe an african-american can be reading this and get pissed just because I'm speaking my mind about his/her race. You don't have a lot of freedom talking to a black person when you're white. And as white as I am.
