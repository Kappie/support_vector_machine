Tyke had to drive through the rain on his way to school and that is never that fun and also he wasn't really looking forward to the day ahead so he wasn't in a great mood to start off with.  In 1st period he left class (against his teacher's desire) to film the teacher impersonation of the librarian, or Shitty Mc"Shatt."  It actually turned out being good.  The funniest part was that right before the filming started, the librarian came in and asked what class they were in, told them to leave, and did like all of the things that he is best known for.  And they got him on tape doing so.  It was great.  He's such an ass that they don't really care that he most likely doesn't know they were taping.  But Tyke did his impersonation, he told people to get off computers, stop drinking non-water, to have a pass, and all the other Schatt-isms.  So all in all it wasn't too bad.  Then weight training was just like it has been for the last week.  And gov wasn't too bad either.  English was pretty weird today.  Tyke actually finished reading The Glass Menagerie in class today.  Quietly.  By himself.  So that was tight.  Tyke actually liked the play and it was joyous to just sit and read cuz Tyke hasn't really done that in a long time.  It's a shame but Tyke hasn't read a good book in quite some time.  They tried to leave really early but got shut down so they only got out like 5 minutes early and then went to McD's.  5th period involved Tyke waiting for Purdy to text him cuz he thought she was going to and then just leaving class to walk around for a while.  Then 6th period was just finishing up a lab and watching a Physics video.  And then the day was over.  Unfortunately for Tyke, although it is his choice, he has to go to school tomorrow but that's fine.  A lot of people will be gone so it should be an easy day.  Right after school at Tyke's house there was a Prom meeting that Tyke planned.  All 8 members of the group came: Tyke, Skippy, Amed, Maniak, Dr. Phil, Macaroon, Tyronious, and Piggy J.  Although they really didn't accomplish anything for a long time, Tyke finally got what he wanted.  The group to make some freaking decisions.  They called some hotels and decided on one of them for their final plan.  The Grand Hyatt Hotel.  It's gonna be tight.  They had to get 2 rooms, and there was no way to make them adjoined but that's ok, but the two rooms are going to be good.  It isn't all that expensive and since the hotel is nice, the rooms should be too.  Tyke is happy with this decision as he is tired of his house always being the place for everything.  The proximity is nice, but the clean-up is a bitch.  Tyke even had to clean up after the prom meeting they had for 2 hours, so just think about an all-night party.  Yeesh.  But yeah, hotel after prom.  That's gonna be fun.  Hopefully no obstacles will arise from here out.  Tyke's parents are almost totally on-board with the idea, or as totally on-board as they will get, so Tyke isn't worried about not being able to stay there.  And that is good.  It's gonna be fun spending the night with Purdy.  This afternoon/evening has passed by pretty quickly so Tyke is thinking he should go accomplish something.  But what?  Hmmm...nothing to do really.  Ok then.  Malibu will be taking away some of Tyke's friends this weekend but he will be able to occupy himself with filming the English final for at least one day this weekend.  And having Monday off is just sick.  Tyke hasn't decided if he's going to go to school on Tuesday but he really doesn't think he'll be able to get it excused so he will most likely have to come.  That's gay.  His parents really don't allow him any freedom when it comes to going to school/doing schoolwork.  That's annoying.  Luckily they are busy almost all the time so he at least gets to not do schoolwork without getting caught.  Ahhh the beauty of the double-income families of the 21st century.  Gotta love it.
