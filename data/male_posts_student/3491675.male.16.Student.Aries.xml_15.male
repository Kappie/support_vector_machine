I like curt cobain i think he was a very down to earth vey cool writter and stuff;but after having to hear nirvana day after day on t.v. the media just killed him again and this time it didn't take courtney love to kill him. THis time the media and magazines killed him. Take for example nirvana it's now mostly focused on curt cobain and whenever it is his death anniversary there's pre-nirvana weekend and then there's the actuall nirvana remembrece day where they play nirvana music all day. and yo u feel like screamng enough. then there's het post after wekend celbration and in the end you wind up not wanting to hear nirvana for ever.
