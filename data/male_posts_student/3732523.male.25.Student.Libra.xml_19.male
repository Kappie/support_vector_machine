I mean you deal with money *all* day long except that NONE of it is yours.  None.  Nada.  Zilch.  Zip.  So it sucks.  It especially sucks when all day you are looking at accounts that have $20K or more in them - and again, its  NOT  yours.  Its amazing for this area - such small towns - how much money there really is.  There are so many rich people here, people you'd never GUESS had that much money... its crazy.  When is it my turn?  Anyways, as I was saying before I got onto the whole money thing - working sucks.  You know, I moved here late December - quit my job to move to a small town in the Kootenays and, maybe, hopefully, find a new job.  And I have one - its part-time/casual mind you but its a job.  But I now realize I hate working.  I had 3 months of doing-whatever-the-hell-I-want and I liked it.  I want that back.  Hell, I want a job where I can work from home so I can show up in my PJs.  That would even be acceptable.  But this getting up to go work for someone else really bites.  Especially at a job where you deal with money and none of it is yours.  Its Friday, its been a long day, I don't know what to make for dinner and I'm tired.  I'm so glad the weekend is here - not that I worked a lot this week - but the weekend means Adam will be home so I'll have someone to bug! *cackles evilly*  Okay I hear a nanaimo bar calling my name... Mmmmmm...
