The thing I was wondering was, do they mean it in a good way or a bad way? Because the lungs are made up of partly water, but also water in your lungs can be really bad. Any ideas?   Well, at work today, I...worked? I don't know. I'm getting tired of telling you people (the whole 1 or 2 people who read this) that I got cut and bled and just listened to music all day. That's basically what's happened again. It was boring. But when I got home, I had this brilliant idea - Hang out with Aaron! So he came over for a while and we had a great time, but when he left for a bit of work at school, I fell asleep and nobody answered his calls, thus ruining my fun evening. Well, that's all I got. Peace Easy.
