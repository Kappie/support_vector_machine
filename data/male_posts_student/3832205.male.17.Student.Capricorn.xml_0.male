Tis a true mans sport, and girls love it ;).  It's amazing how I went from shit, crying myself to sleep, to feeling amazing once again. Can you say mood swings :P. Hopefully things stay like this for a while again, it's a great feeling wich is always greatly missed.  Haha, last night was a great time Saul. GO KERRY! We need to do shit like that all the time and work on our songs more too, it's a lot of fun. You are a great friend anyone would be honored to have. SHE CALLED THE COPS!!!!!! LOL!!!!    Lol, well this is getting kind of long so im gonna end it, peace. ;)   Quote:  "My pens paint people that ive proven wrong"  Music:  R Kelly - The Worlds Greatest  Mood:  I am INVISIBLE!
