It was fun for the 30 minutes I got to be with her, but it is better then not seeing her at all.   Meaningful day? I wouldn't say so. I just kind of did nothing. Played a little AOE but kind of felt useless, as usual. I think I am going to need to brush up on my AOE skills pretty quickly. I dunno, I just feel like I'm there just to be there instead of really helping out.   And I'm done.  *Searches for a quote* I think I am going to compile a list and just put them all in a text document to bring out at need.  "Captain's log, stardate 23.9 rounded off to the nearest decimal point. We've traveled back in time to save an ancient species from total annihilation. SO FAR, no signs of aquatic life, but I'm going to find it. If I have to tear this universe another black hole, I'm going to find it. I've GOT TO, MISTER!" --Jim Carrey  I have an idea you guys. Post your favorite actors and I will try and find a list of quotes from each of them (obviously you don't have to worry about Jim Carrey, I think I have him already)
