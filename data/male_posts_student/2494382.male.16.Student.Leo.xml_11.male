So a lot has happened since i last have spoken. First off, we got through Euro. ok enought talking/speakibng about that shit class for the rest of my life. School is only 1 day away from being finished. THANK GOD and another god i worship, sarah the goddess of love. Today i started a new processes in my life called- expanding my web and phasing out any of my old friends that are girls in particular andrea martinson. O wait, thats just what she thought i was doing cause i didnt sit with the usual people at lunch today. but then we realized i didnt sit there cause the entire friggen school had the same lunch. So, soccer has been going well, if any of you are wondering. We are like 0-10000 but hey were doing well... we have a game on WEDNESDAYW at 7 at oak park so you should all be there or i will haze you all by making u drink, run outside in the rain, suck down twinkies, make u suck a raw bratwords, and kick you endless. o and ill also get caught and get a ticket for DWI and get expelled from highschool (o wait thats not me). anyways, im the popularist guy in the group, big ass titties bitches think im cute. and im out
