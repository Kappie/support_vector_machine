Hello is working too now, so I’m really happy xD Trying to post pictures up now, but thanks to a slow net, that won’t happen anytime soon.        Let’s see… I bought a bunch of pirated CD’s, oh woe is me xD Hardly any of them worked, so that blows. Most of the Phill Collins  Greatest Hits  works (spare one song), and so does G3’s  Rockin’ in the Free World , so it’s all good.     I'm finally reading Brave New World, by Adlous Huxley, and its, quite frankly, disturbing. I mean these people exist 200 years after Ford. Not Anno Domini, no, I mean after Ford's T-Model car xD So the time they use is A.F. And they refer to their leader as "His Fordship", and to top things off, they do the sign of the T, which is like the sign of the christ, but a T.  Then you have the issue of how they encourage children to have SEX with each other.  But like  1984 , its dystopian, so its understandable.      GOD i'm loving this rich text editor xD      I stayed up for an hour listening to Yoshi talk last night, and though this itself wasn't bad, hearing him repeat himself was xD So if you're reading, take it as a hint not to over do the talking  xD       Ca Bau Kan , this book we're reading for Indonesian, has crushed my soul. I am blank reading this.  I tried reading a page, then I nodded off almost.      Ummmmm,   HELLO SEXY       xD Random outburst.       urlLink Click Here  for Porn     *sigh*      Though i'm over the whole "I need a girlfriend" stage, I do want one because when you stay up talking to a GUY it gets depressing xD       Oooooo, yes I wish it would rain down on me now      Who wants a picture of me with my new haircut? Nobody, good xD
