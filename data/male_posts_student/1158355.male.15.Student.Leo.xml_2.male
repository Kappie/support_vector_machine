It's because my teacher never tought us any of the stuff like little Sanchez or King Tecknuttoo... ya know the meaningless shit the this horrible world feeds us teens just so we could get pissed off. Mr. Madeiras teaches us governments and basic, things to help you in life. I saw some African questions on the test, I was like WTF? Paul Stoltz drove me and Erin Sills home which was really funny when Paul said that the Gambacks and that other freak never talked to each other yet they never seperate. Then Mrs. Stoltz said "They Just Go"... I dunno you had to be there. The day sucked, all I did was play Gamecube and go to Pat's and Dan's. Walking home from Dan's, 3 dogs started barking a beat so I stayed there dancing in the road and the lady just stared at me for the longest time until I ran home in zig zags singing in dog language. Now I'm studying for math and then straight to bed!
