Let me first say that regardless of my views on gay marriage in this country,its moral implicationsare not the primary concern here. All this was, was a not so ingenious plan bysome panicking Republicansto further divide voters on issues that will create stronger party lines just in time for the November election. They knew as well as we did that it would not pass, but it created some heat -- some debate. The more divisive people are this political season the more likely they are to remain firm on supporting one candidate (and not changing their views). Bush, the "conservative, Christian patriot" would take the credit for at least trying to pass the amendment as he blames Kerry, the "liberal, immoral flip-flopper"for not doing so. Even if Kerry is our president next year, wouldn't it be a wonderful thing to attack him with? Nice try, Bush (or should I say Karl Rove?).    What can we conclude? Election year  razzle dazzle  ... don't you love the drama?
