Since we're talking about Finch... Tell me something else about it.    fenderST234:   Well Finch is very creepy.   SmarterChild:  Finch is very creepy? That's very interesting. What other band would you describe as very creepy?    fenderST234:   band?  SmarterChild:  Very creepy? Very interesting. Are there any other musical activities that you would describe as very creepy?    fenderST234:   musical activities?...   SmarterChild : Eh. Whatever fenderST234...   I was suprised to see that Smarterchild knew who Finch was. Although, I was very confused when he started talking about some band or musical activities.... Oh well, I am very happy that Finch has gone global being large, and creepy and all. Also see hosted.durp.net/finch to see Finch's fan site that is sweeping the nation ... er ... at least it  was  ... until Scribner brought it down at it's peak....
