Which is unfortunate, even though Tyke didn't do all that much on any of those days.  Today was Tyke's last chance to see anybody before he has to see them at school again so he went to Amed's and played basketball with Amed, Maniak, Tyronious, Macaroon, K-caj, and Dr. Phil.  Tyke played pretty well for most of the day.  His outside shot was pretty dead-on in the early games so he felt comfortable trying to take over the game.  They played some full court games and some old fat guy came and played with them as well so Amed had to guard that sweaty beast.  After the games Tyke went home and just sat around like he has done for each of the last 4 days really.  Watched some TV and almost did some homework.  Hopefully tomorrow Tyke does work on his dialectical journal.  But...you probably know how that will turn out.  Tyke talked with his parents some and even did some ironing with his mom which started off gay but Tyke made it known that he didn't want his shirt all stiff and that he didn't want pleats so he sorta did it his own way and made it work.  Ironing is weird.  Tyke used to know how to iron fine and he did it pretty frequently for some reason.  Then all of a sudden he stopped and now he didn't remember how to do it in the right order and just keep it wrinkle-free.  But he is starting to remember so he's pleased with that.  The iron is hot.  It burns.  Tyke watched a new episode of the Simpsons as since there is no Refuge tonight he was actually home while that was on.  It was weird not having Refuge.  It has become a routine for him.  And it is a great way to finish off the week by hanging out with 3 of his favorite ladies.  Oh well, next time will be even better.  So Tyke still isn't in a good mood but he got cheered up when he checked his email and saw an email from Tina.  She hadn't emailed him in over a week cuz she's been gone but she took the time to email him from Puerto Rico and that was a really nice way to make Tyke feel at least a little better about his current state of mind.  He still is a little down cuz school is starting up again and the other self-explanatory reasons.  The only reason Tyke ever really gets depressive is because of the same thing over and over.  And it is stupid but optimism is what it's all about.  Hopefully this blog was a little bit more upbeat but really Tyke is waiting for another reason to be really happy.  Just waiting.
