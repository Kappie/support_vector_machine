I will now try to recreate the drumeone in ASCII text.  | |    | | | |     _____________ | |    |  __________   | | |__|  |     ^        _|  | |_____|      |        |__|                   |     Slider # 2  I really hope this translates well into the Blogger text form. If not, screw you, imagine it. Or, IM me to send you some pictures :-O
