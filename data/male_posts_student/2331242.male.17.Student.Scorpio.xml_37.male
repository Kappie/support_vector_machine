Hopefully this blog will open a few eyes.  Some of us juniors, myself included, will be old enough to vote in the 2004 election. When you do, don't vote republican because you're a republican, or democrat because you're a democrat. Vote because you feel the need to have your voice heard in our political system. But do not speak out of ignorance. Before you vote this coming november, there are a few things you should know about our current president.   1.  It appears that the Bush Administration has consistently misled the American public about Iraq , most significantly regarding Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction and his ties to al Queda and Osama bin Laden. http://www.fair.org/press-releases/beyond-niger.html    2.  The Bush Administration's regressive environmental policies have lowered cleanliness standards for our air and water while allowing utility companies (many of whom are Bush campaign contributors) to profit off of the weakened regulations. In 2002, the head of the EPA's Office of Regulatory Enforcement resigned, complaining that the agency was “fighting a White House that seems determined to weaken the rules we are trying to enforce." (CNN, Aug. 22, 2002) The Bush Record on the Environment for 2003: http://www.nrdc.org/bushrecord/2003.asp    3.  Bush is underfunding education. The President cut $200 million from his own No Child Left Behind Act, eliminating crucial educational programs for lower income children and cutting professional training for more than 20,000 teachers.   Flawed from its very foundation, No Child Left Behind is based on then-Governor Bush's late-‘90s “Texas Miracle,”—a program of standardized testing designed to increase performance and reduce dropout rates--now recognized as a scandalous failure. http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0338/schanberg.php    4.  The Bush Administration's Patriot Act threatens our constitutional rights and civil liberties. Passed by a post 9/11 Congress, the Patriot act expands the ability of law enforcement to conduct secret searches, and engage various forms of surveillance, including internet monitoring and wiretapping. It gives the FBI access to American citizens' highly personal medical, financial, mental health, and student records without notification or permission, and allows them to investigate individuals without probable cause of a crime. Finally, it permits non-citizens to be jailed based on mere suspicion and held indefinitely in six month increments without meaningful judicial review.  http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=12126=207    5.  Bush's Tax Cuts only benefit the rich. Bush claimed that his tax cut would “reduce tax rates for everyone who pays income tax.” He failed to mention that this “relief” program would put half of the tax cut's dividends into the hands of our nation's wealthiest 5%, while 8.1 million citizens in the bottom half of the income bracket receive approximately $300 a year. http://www.ctj.org/html/gwbfinal.htm    6.  3.3 million jobs (93,000 in August of 2003 alone) have been lost since Bush took office--more than the last 11 Presidents combined. (Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 2001-August 2003) Meanwhile, huge corporations are paying fewer taxes than ever: http://www.cbpp.org/10-16-03tax.htm    7.  Bush is underfunding homeland security : While energetic in waging war abroad, the Bush administration has been oddly lethargic in fortifying our defenses at home. Domestic security agencies have been neglected. Police and firefighters have been denied essential resources, and muddled public strategy has only spread alarm and confusion. http://www.ppionline.org/    In other news...  Yesterday was the two month anniversary for me and Martha. It was also the day the Panthers lost the superbowl. Well, that was (almost) offset by the fact that I got to hold her for four straight hours :)  I have lots of schoolwork piling up. It's not a very good feeling.  My audition for Governor's School is this Saturday. I'm still debating whether I should go or not. It  is  a once in a lifetime opportunity, but it's also  six extra weeks of school, smack in the middle of summer.  Well, I guess I have to make it first.  FFXI is calling me. Goodnight.
