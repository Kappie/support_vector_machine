She doesn't like the idea of me blogging.   In the dark our that this week is being. It is one ofthe only conforts that I get. Perhaps once things get back on track things will be fine. Human interaction feels like a bit too much at the moment. I just want to chill the fire that burns me inside.   I will post my text about life. It is pretty much how I feel at this moment.
