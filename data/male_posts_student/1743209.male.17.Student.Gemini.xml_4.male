To be honest, when i woke up, i was surprised to see the sun shining, as yesterday evening, there was a sudden, monsoon like thunderstorm (which was highly irrating, as my mum made me shut down my PC 'cos she thought the lightning would fry it!).  Anyway, so, today we all went out for the day. It was pretty good, I enjoyed getting out the house. When we came back, I continued working on the song i mentioned yesterday, only to find part of it was similar to "Leader of Men" by Nickelback which i listened to yesterday for the first time, so subconsiously, I seemed to have worked out the guitar part for that, and changed it slightly. Never mind, my song kicks ass anyway!  Anyway, so that's what's gone on today. See you tommorrow!
