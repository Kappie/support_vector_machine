She seems really cool.....smart yet odd, likes aardvarks, and is extremely pretty. Her, Lauren, and I spent the day together. Later that night, I went to a show to hear my friend, Aaron (lead guitarist in my band, Los Barqueros), play. He played an excellent show. He gave all of us a surprise wah wah solo in Little Wing by Jimi Hendrix. It really touched my soul. I almost cried but I didn't want to look like a sissy. LOL! Well Im bored so I am gonna get goin. You people have a nice day! Cyaz!
