A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now. You're here, that's all I need to know. And you will keep me safe, And you will keep me close, And rain will make the flowers grow.    But you will live, 'Ponine, dear God above... If I could close your wounds with words of love...   Just hold me now, and let it be, Shelter me, comfort me...    You would live a hundred years, If I could show you how. I won't desert you now.   The rain can't hurt me now. This rain will wash away what's past. And you will keep me safe, And you will hold me close, I'll sleep in your embrace at last.  The rain that brings you here is heaven blessed. The skies begin to clear, and I'm at rest... A breath away from where you are, I've come home from so far.  Don't you fret, Monsieur Marius, (  Hushabye, dear Eponine,  ) I don't feel any pain. (  You won't feel any pain.  ) A little fall of rain (  A little fall of rain  ) Can hardly hurt me now. (  Can hardly hurt you now.  )   I'm here.   That's all I need to know. And you will keep me safe, And you will keep me close, (  I will stay with you 'til you are sleeping...  ) And rain (  And rain  ) Will make the flowers... (  Will make the flowers  )   Grow.   Love, Jon Roskilly
