So far away liao..around 80metres -.- KAO~  Den arh..in akina..he always go first..unless u using 6 gear cars...at least can overtake him at second turn...at the 'S' turn..will try to push my car..must counter back, den if fail to counter back...will bang the wall, hai...I'm so lousy, I'm shit man! 'N' levels is coming near...might consider taking a break from Initial D...hmm, when that time comes, den I think about it baz..  PS: For those who never play Initial D, Bunta is a anime char from Initial D de...in the animes he is unbeatable..in the game, well, at least he is beatable, and that is good ^^
