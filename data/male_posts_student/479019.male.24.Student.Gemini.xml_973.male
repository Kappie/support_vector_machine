I like how Steff and her sister keep giving me future permission to slap her... yesterday at lunch, she said if, when she gets married, she becomes one of those annoying couples that say "we" all the time... I can slap her. Cissa also once said that if Steff ever falls asleep at a show again, I have permission to slap her.  Eeew... these scrambled eggs I just made came out weird... ok enough of this..  Anyway, I didn't have any caffeine yesterday at all. So after lunch, when I went to the library to go through some old NY Times stuff on movies, I crashed. That's what happens when you're used to 4 shots of espresso, 2 cups of coffee, and other stuff in a day... despite that, I did find some interesting stuff.  I'm closing at work today. Happy happy joy joy... or maybe not.  I feel like I could really use a dose of excitement or misery. Things are too normal in my life right now.   ***
