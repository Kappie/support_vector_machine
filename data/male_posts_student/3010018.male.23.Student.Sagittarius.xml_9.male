The dilemma is more along the lines of the conflict of American and Pakistani society than anything to do with Islam. Although the “rules” that I have been taught seem to be a combination of religion and culture and the line is so blurred that I cannot tell the difference between what is and what is not culture and what is and what is not religion. Unfortunately at times it looks all the same to me.  Perhaps I am articulating thoughts that all people have, considering the whole world seems to be a mesh of difference societies and religions. But I think that Im not cut from the same mold as my peers. My close friends and loved ones don’t think like I do; not that any two people think exactly alike but I think so differently than my friends or anyone I know for that matter that it’s a little scary. The majority of Muslims that I talk to or know well do not think like I do. It is scary to me because I wonder why haven’t I bought into the system like everyone else ? Why cant I accept the shortcomings of our society and the difficulties of our Faith like everyone else? Why do I find so much to criticize? While my friends find it easy to follow the rules set by society that govern how they live, how they study, even how they love…I find fault with all of it…I am so frustrated by the binds that this society puts not only on myself but people around me that sometimes I wish I could run away from it all. Unfortunately I cannot do that. As easy as that sounds I would have to give up the things that are of paramount importance in my life. My family, my friends, my fiancée. It’s the love and compassion that these people give me that keeps me in this society. They are probably the only reason I deal with and put with the bullshit of this society and trust me there is a ton of bullshit in this society.  So here is my dilemma: I do not wish to give up my family friends and my love but sometimes the bullshit of this society lights a fire of fury inside me that at times cannot be contained. I do not know which one to choose, my loved ones or choosing to rebel against this society. I fear that if I choose to silence my frustrations and criticisms then those thoughts will fester inside and eventually cause such a mess that nothing will be able to clean it up. But if I cultivate these thoughts, then I worry that my heart and mind will tell me to move away from the things that hurt me. And the worst party is that my loved ones are eternally bound up in the very thing that gives me so much anger. They have issue with society but they seem to put their problems to rest of at the very least they silence their objections so that they can live and function in this society. I cannot silence these objections; I cannot put these problems to rest. These problems have ruined too many lives and I speak only of those lives that I have seen before my very eyes be destroyed because of this society and this society only. I have friends who live everyday in small hells because of this society’s ridiculous traditions and customs. I have friends who have lost hope that they will find love because this society would not allow them to be together; despite the fact that both of them are at appropriate ages and in good situations to be married. How can so many people live in such a society that forces the suppression of emotions to the point at which people literally become numb to their emotions?  What is more frustrating than anything else is the fact that most people who I talk to those to whom I express these doubts, frustrations, and fears…they dismiss them as the useless ramblings of a growing adult or as insanity that should simply not be acknowledged. They do not respect these thoughts as being legitimate, they simply say well that’s just the way things are; you have to accept them. They say, you cannot escape society because if you do you will have to turn your back on everything you know and everyone you love. Almost as if they are trying to force me to stay by scaring me. By threatening the loss of my loved ones they think that I will stop thinking this way and fall in line like the rest of the army ants. But no amount of threats will keep me from thinking…regardless of what those thoughts are nothing will keep me from thinking about the things that inspire, disturb, or enlighten me. As good as that sounds it is rather saddening because so many people respond to my thoughts and ideas in anger and disgust or with a lecture about how I am simply not religious enough. If I was a better Muslim then I wouldn’t have these issues. And that if I devote myself more to my faith then everything will be ok because once I envelope myself in something with complete blind faith so as to silence my questions then my soul will feel justified or somehow content with the horrible reality that is our society.
