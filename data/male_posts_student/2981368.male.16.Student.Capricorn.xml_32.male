Until now I started to figure that Jack might actually be getting less annoying. No constant and random paper flicking, no constant and random persuasion bursts (well, less than usual at least). Lets just say...maybe tomorrow. Maybe not.   Highlights of the day...probably taking the piss out of the English Ice Hockey League and all their rip-of-of-NHL-logos in sci, laughing at Sam filing his nails in french, and jumping Mat's petrol car over a stream into a big patch of brambles. Woot. Oh, and I just  can't wait  to read J's latest thrilling installment of the Nat and Ben saga. See what random crap will be spewed out today.
