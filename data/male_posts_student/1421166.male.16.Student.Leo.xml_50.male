Then, I spent the whole day feeling so sick. I took my temperature lots of times, and it's 37.59 degrees!!! And I couldn't go home unless it's 37.60 and above. But actually, I rarely even reach 37 and above. But who cares now. Argh...hope I'll get better soon...still have slight headache. Oh well, I think I'm gonna tell my parents that I have decided to stay in S'pore for my studies. Cause I decided that it would not be very good for me spiritually to go now, especially, when I'm not even grounded very well in the Word and Faith. So I'll stay. Feel so sick, really nothing today. Except that I realised that Zhongmin's a Christian, he's from the Bethel Assembly of God. Ya...so just talk la. Ok...I think life will get exciting eventually. For now, I just wish to talk to people, I think I feel relaxed talking to people...hehe...
