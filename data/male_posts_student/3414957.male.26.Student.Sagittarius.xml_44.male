No love connection here with my friend but we are still friends and we can talk about our feelings no matter what they are which is really great.   My heart turned to ice............so cold and motionless. I still will care and think about her, wish her well in anything she does or in any relationship she has. I just have to hope, just hope that one day my dreams and her dreams will cross and on that day, she will find feelings of love for me. Until then, I will be the best friend and man I know how to be.    I wrote some poems....... just go back to my web site. www.soylentracing.com Its under the stories/poem link...or under the "whats on my mind" part of the menu at the top.  The newer ones towards the bottom reflect my current feelings. Read'em, make fn of them, laugfh at them, I dont care. Someone is trying to stomp out my love of life, I can't let them win! I will go on.  Oh and also.......HURRAY FOR THE PISTONS!!!! Sorry Kobe.....dont drop the soap!
