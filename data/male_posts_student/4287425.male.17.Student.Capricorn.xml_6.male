Anyways, after typing that into google I got the one and only match to my old page which, to my own surprise, still remains on geocities servers.  Here's the link for anyone in need of a laugh, or just something to make them feel better about themselves.   urlLink http://www.geocities.com/sirmattias52/LordSwanksFortressofFat.html   Enjoy!
