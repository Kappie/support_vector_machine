I've been told time and time again to just focus on the books, and not to get caught up in the chaos of my chosen field.  While I've tried my best, I do feel like that it got the best of me.  Studying is difficult, and my motivation, shot.  Meanwhile, my personal relationships are suffering, and I'm just confused as heck.  I hope that things will work out for me.  On the other hand, to cheer myself up, I bought three pairs of shoes.  And now it's crunch time...
