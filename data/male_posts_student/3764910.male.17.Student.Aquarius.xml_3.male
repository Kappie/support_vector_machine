I stayed up all Friday night/Saturday morning then went skating for 11 hours. Went to blantyre first. Decent skate but a bit busy 'cause all the livi skaters' were there ('cause of the livi skate party). Went to EK and fell alot. Came home, ate indian then slept. How exciting? Stayed up all Saturday night and here i am just now.
