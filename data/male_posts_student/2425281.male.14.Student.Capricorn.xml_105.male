I coach for the players, I coach for the game. What I've done over the last three years I don't want any raps for but I don't deserve the shit you've fucking given me. Not one word of it...You tell me what happened tonight. The shit you dished up to me over that, I'll remember it. A few people haven't shown their faces this week but I'll remember it. You go hard, go as hard as you like. You haven't broken me in nine years and you won't break me now."  He's not the only one that is sick of the bullshit and prentiousness that occurs in society nowadays. Every one seems to be so goddam self-conscious they wont even tell the truth in case it wrecks their own high view of themselves.   E.g. You should be more subtle about what you say...  Im not going to say something nice and disembled just to please some person. If its shit, its shit. If its good, its good. Simple, clear-cut statements. None of this "well, it is intriguing and shows you have tried your best." Face it, this means YOUR TERRIBLE. GO GET A NEW HOBBY.   The world is a worse place if there are not enough people who will just tell the truth.  GOULDY, you wont ever be forgotten.
