We are confident that the Kerry campaign, the unstoppable juggernaut of the Democratic primaries, will continue blasting its way through the rest of the country. Bringing his dream of a never-ending reign of unbridled carnage and suffering to the rest of America will be difficult, but in the end, we are sure he will succeed.    NEWS BULLETIN: At a recent rally, Senator Kerry paused from gnawing on raw human flesh and mutilating defensless kittens to announce,    "KNEEL TREMBLING BEFORE YOUR NEW LORD AND MASTER FOR ALL ETERNITY. BRING YOUR CHILDREN TO ME, SO THAT I MAY DEVOUR THEIR SOULS AND LIVE FOREVER. MY ARMIES OF RADIOACTIVE SUPERMEN WILL MARCH TO SLAY ALL WHO OPPOSE ME. BEHOLD: KERRY, THE NEW FACE OF PAIN."   He then cackled maniacally to resounding applause, afterwords giving autographs and greeting the public.   Senator Kerry is expected to make attempts to lift the ban on human cloning if he is elected, along with several child abuse statutes and anti-cannibalism legislation.
