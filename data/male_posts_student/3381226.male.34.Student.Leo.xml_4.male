She doesn't see it.  She doesn't realize how mean spirited she can become.  It's hard to try to get inside her head and see what she needs and why she needs it.  It seems we are beyond love.  We are into some weird new teritory where only the answers to deeply spiritual or personal questions will do.  I can not answer them for her.  I can only hope that in some way I can ease her journey, maybe be a better husband and friend.  Maybe...
