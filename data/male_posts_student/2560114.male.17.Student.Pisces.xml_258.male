Hmmmm...seemz to me that when ppl try to let go, they tend to try to make the person that they tried to get jealous to make them think "damn...i could of been wit that person...i miss that person soooo much." Its funny how this world workz at times, ppl think their way is right or ppl try to make what they believe in happen...there is a reason that everything happenz the way it does...life is jus a big lesson, its a road system that everyone takes...every road is not perfect, ur gonna go through a lot of bumpz and a lot of pot holez in this road that u chose to take, but it either endz in a fiasco or a success...either way, at the end of each road there is a lesson learned, and then u can take new paths and make new mistakez and make new thingz happen. But there r some ppl who go backwardz and look back and go back to those roads. Goin back and lookin back ledz to pain and u facin the same problemz over again, its jus gonna happen again and again and again...i was like this once...lookin back, tryin to solve what i needed to do to be happy, or i thought that would lead to my ultimate happiness. I use to b like "omg...if im wit her im gonna b happy forever!"...it doesnt work that way, u have to keep movin on and keep lookin for the better thingz that life has to offer...u cant fall in the same traps again or vice versa...its times like these that i felt pathetic, lost, confused, sad and depressed...then finally...i took another road, a new road...a much better road...im still on this road, the road that has led me to stephanie...the more i walked on this road, the more my feelinz increased for steph...i am greatful that she came into my life and showed me a new way to look at thingz...thnx steph, u mean so much to me, its unbelievable..:D...so the lesson that i have learned through the way is that there r better thingz that u may not believe, but when it happenz...then it hitz u...and its an awesome feeling...but ppl have to learn from their mistakez...even if they have to let them happen again...all im sayin is that ppl shouldnt look back or go back to pplz trapz cuz ur going to get hurt...again...but its not my choice, u ppl have to make ur own decisionz...even if its the wrong onez...i feel that the past right now is a repeating for some ppl(u know who u guyz r), but its pathetic that ppl want to repeat the past and jus want some action instead of the whole package...and all of this to make a certain someone jealous...and how do i know this and how do i come up wit all of these answerz...cuz im that damn good...well whatever u guyz do, so b it...i am happy now, im so glad that my feelinz for stephanie are strong and i am thankful that she feelz the sam e way about me, and i dont want to go back to the past...i jus want to continue on this road and see where it takez me...and im lovin every moment of it...payce outside.
