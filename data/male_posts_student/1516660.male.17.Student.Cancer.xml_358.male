Oh kokomana, secret!" :P  Hmm. What happened today? Yeah. Today's bascially quite slack la. Like all Fridays. HaHa!   Okay. Morning quite boring, except that we were almost late for morning assembly. Luckily we just got there at the command (whatever is that spelt). Hmm. Chem lecture was okay.  Yay! No GP! Well, technically not. He just came in 30 minutes to revise with us comprehension skills, then went off to take the drama cats to their SYF. We just have to finish one worksheet, then can go off le. Me and CQ walked past WQ's and Janet's classroom (do you know their GP class is side-by-side? coolies!). HaHa!   Hmm. For MT hor. He found out that CQ 'copied' me la, for book review. Hmm. He got sharp eyes. I didn't say anything la, but oh well. I don't wanna say anything like "I am innocent" because I would get CQ into trouble. So, qing qing lor. Hmm. Got what also? Nothing else le.  After that, CQ went for his weekly exercise and I went to find Janet. Hmm. The teachers next to us were making jokes about Mr Quek. Yeah. So bad one...we decided to leave. CQ was soon done, so was Gloria.  We went to Causeway Point to eat (oh my lord! So itchy! Itch Itch Itch!). I ate duck porridge, following Gloria. HaHa. I got three ulcers in my mouth leh, and close to each other some more. So painful! I can only eat those non-spicy, plain food. Chillies are killers on ulcers. Yeah. The duck porridge there is damn nice man! Okay..after eating, we all went home.   Okay. Bascially what I did at home? I immediately plonked down on mah bed and started sleeping. HaHa. Pig! After that, it is terribly boring la.   YaY! Rupert won the second million dollar prize! YaY for him! Go Rupert! Oh yes! I forgot to mention about yesterdaty's AI results! America has done it again! They've voted off LaToya London, and putting Fantasia in the second-last placings! Oh my lord! I thought Jasmine was going (and she should...Diana, Fantasia and LaToya are too good!). Stupid right? Well, no surprise who's going next week. The two finalists I am predicting: Fantasia and Diana. Fun fact: They are both from Group 1, who entered the finalists together. Hopefully, they are ending together too! :)  Ahh! I am so tired le. I think I go sleep le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
