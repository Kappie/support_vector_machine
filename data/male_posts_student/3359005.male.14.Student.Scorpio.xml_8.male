Well I'm getting a little wierd, using the example of making a 70 year old couple give birth to 4 kids to tend to the farm! Well anyway I was getting jealous at the kids not having to go to school on alternate days, without having to see a doctor!  Well anyway I'm not staying in Boarding School for the next semester, and so my dad's going to get a timer fixed in my bloody computer. I hate that so much; what if I had a project that needed so much time to fix. I can see it now, that big red sign; "You have exceeded the time limit. Please call your father if you would like to request for extra time!" Oh my gosh, why can't these people just trust me? But anyway, on the bright side, my computer can be re-booted now!  Sorry for having nothing to write, but there's a difficult challenge on Survivor Fire that my tribe is currently trailing in. So I've gotta help...
