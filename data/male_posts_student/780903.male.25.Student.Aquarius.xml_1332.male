They'd ask you a few questions, pick a number, and then have you take an IQ test to see if they were right.  Maybe this is why my imaginary theme park would go bankrupt.  >>A poem, based on lunch today:  4 scallops 31 dollars 4 scallops And a mound of vegetables Asparagus Peas, Carrots, Corn Undercooked corn In a green sauce Maybe more vegetables Maybe not 4 scallops 31 dollars 4 scallops Too much salt
