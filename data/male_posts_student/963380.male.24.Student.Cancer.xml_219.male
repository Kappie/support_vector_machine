What it has done is destroy any chance that I might have to get away - creating an environment of hatred and rage towards me from a variety of friendlike sources. I'm sure Jeff and Liz aren't speaking to me at all right now. I blame that entirely on Rob. I'll get a day off soon, I swear it. BY GRABTHAR'S HAMMER!!   Zounds. City of Heroes debuted the first expansion. It's sexier than a room full of Leeloo's. I can *fly* while I'm *invisible*. Woo. I feel very  uber .  I bought the Megaman Collection. It's kicking my ass. I thought I'd gotten better at videogames - in reality they've just become easier. Oh the ego, it hurts.  Speaking of hurting, with all the god damn exercise I've been getting lately, I'm hurting, and I'm growing some kind of tissue all around my body.  I think it's called muscle. I'll have to ask one of the non-geeks at work.
