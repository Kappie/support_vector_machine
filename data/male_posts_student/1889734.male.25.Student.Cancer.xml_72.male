Kim Jong-Il craves attention, and the less public attention he gets, the more agitated he becomes.  It is best we handle this quietly and with a minimum of public fuss.    I still think this ends in one of two ways.  1.) China yanks his chain and he wises up.  2.) He exercises the only option he has left to avoid looking like a complete fool - he tests a nuke.  At that moment, the next war begins, and I see no other way to assure the safety of that part of the world other than immediate nuclear strikes on North Korean weapons facilities, as well as conventional decapitation strikes on the North Korean leadership.  If anyone wants to kick around my NK thinking, let me know and I'll expand my thoughts.
