Seems like yesterday when I moved in and he towered over me. But gettin' back to the main point....yeah congrats on gettin married =P.  So yeah as you can tell, today my neighbour got married....well actually his son Scott did. Point is someone got married to someone. That was just one of the many things that actually happened today....and my weekends seem to be pretty jumbled now. But yet they are fun....and I love livin' every minute of it....so starting off with my awakening from my 10 hour slumber....  I awoke at 1040am after a 10 hour sleep or so, and preceded to head downstairs to examine the carbon-based foods set forth on my plate that my cornea within my eyes are now locked on (LOOK AT THOSE BIG WORDS!) So after eating sometin, I then went to practice some piano before going to my lesson, along with talkin' to Jason about playin' ball at UCC today. Mornin' went by quickly, as before I knew it, it was already 12:30, and I had to rush to my piano lesson.  So in piano today, we were going to run through some pieces, until I opened my big mouth and said I have some pieces for school where I'm accompiniament for other people. After that, she then said "GREAT WE CAN DO SIGHT READING!" *shudder* The thing I hate most about any music. Sight Reading. Sounds so bad and makes you look bad....so we did that for 30 minutes, but it was good the fact that I now know my pieces better =P. So after 30 minutes, mom then came to pick me up, and off to UCC I went.  For the next 2 hours, I'd play ball with Jason. 1-on-1 I got owned...mostly because my shots ALWAYS short now that I changed my form for shooting, and also because I got lazy on defense lol. Beat him in 21 though =P. After 2 hours though we got bored, so then went and got a lift from dad back to my place.  Back here.....played some PS2, ate food, compy, and stuff. Hmm.....waited for mom to get back then her, dad and me went over to the Yaeck's to congratulate them. Eventually though I was only over there for 15 minutes as I had to then go back home, eat, and then head out for HYPE. Mom got back at 5pm instead of target time of 330pm so yeah.......we got there REAL late lol. But after playing some NSFU on PS2, me and Jason then quickly ate somethin', grabbed two Cokes and then headed out to Carmen's place for HYPE.  Today joining us was Vincent...who has happily volunteered to aid in helping HYPE for the summer....or aka aid in keeping us crazy HYPE kids below "insanely hyper." So today we did a bible study on Wisdom in relationships instead of improv night. Good lesson though nevertheless, with lots of talk about our friendships with one another. Pretty funny  though, me and Dan kept going back to the burns and punching/shoving into lockers as our usual greetings. And also was funny to watch Dan get soaked by Carmen's water tap. See her house is pretty high tech lookin', and handle for the tap looked like a soap dispenser, but when he turned it on WHOOSH! lots of water came out lol. Umm so after the study...which I was in the group w/ Dan, BW and Vincent, we ended in closing prayer *by moi* and then lounged around for a bit.  Then after all other groups were done...we went upstairs for food. LOL so many jokes popped up from this. Examples include Calvin's bragging about how he can turn his hat 360 degrees on his head without use of his hands *he twiches his head like 1000 times* or Josh's comments on White forks....yeah racism towards forks LOL. Too many to count...or the vector joke *Jason, Gavin, Calvin we can all clearly remember that right lol* and of course the "I'M THE WHITE LARRY BIRD" joke from Family Guy. Jason was rolling around on the floor for at least 5 minutes after that. Well if not ROFLing then LWHOT *Laughing w/ Head on Table.* Oh yeah and Calvin reffering to a Chicken Nugget as a Samurai....Vincent had to clearly state that a Samurai is a person....not processed chicken meat with breading. After the food fest though, we headed downstairs and watched the Chinese movie.....which was really depressing. She has the same cell phone as me though lol. Anywho dad came, picked up me Jason and Lina and headed home....taking them home first.  So last hour been spent MSNing, making Slide Show Presentation for Church and....dreaming of a band with Gerty and Joy lol. TLC Joy ahahahhaha....can't wait till that happens lol. Ergh pretty tired right now though...but pretty fun day overall. HYPE has gotta be one of the best meetings ever....yeah life would be pretty drab without Calvin coming up with another intelligent "talent." Oh yeah and somehow me and Lina said 3 things in  row that were almost the same....it all started with another cheesy burn by me....but for once not about a face. So both of us went "NO WAY A NON-FACE BURN!" then "GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE!" Lol somehow we both said that at the same time haha. That pretty much sums up my day I think.....hmm yeah lots of laughs for today. No harm done though....laughing and happiness only increases your life span =P.  Cya.
