Lan called me to go on an adventure and I couldn't refuse...  First, we went to get an oil change... Lan was looking for a hot chick, but he was checking out this old chick and I laughed cause I'm used to Lan's taste in girls. We saw a signed that read "Kid's World." And we went into the car building area.. Honda World. And saw that it was just a room with a tv. They were watching Brother Bear... Brother Bear is the shit. Then we checked out cars and stuff... went over to the Lexus lot and guessed how much each car was worth. That was cool... We went back because we realized that was retarded.... Then...  We went to that one guy's house... I don't know how to spell his name... I'll sound it out: Vome. And then we went to costco to freeload off of the free samples. That's always good. Ran into those chicken nuggets like five times... iono how that happened. Lan was acting like a little baby in the stupid shopping cart. "Baby! Baby! Baaaaaby!" Stupid bitch, Lan. I should've parked him in some aisle and left him there. I will come out the victor in the war of the swollen cheeks! Anyways.. the thingy.. with the thing inside.. raviolli. That was good.. we ran into that twice.. iono how. Oh and we met steven's family friend, Wesley. I like him, he's funny. Just one of those guys that are naturally amusing. Not like Lan, who is a stupid bitch! Stop making fun of me... you are poking at my emotions... These wounds are the hardest to heal. Yea I slap you upside the head a lot.. but it's an affectionate slap, like the friend nudge. You bastard.  Then we went to Fry's for some reason i forgot. But it was just me and Lan looking at Michael Jackson videos from the 80's. They're funny... the beat it video. Where he dances alone in the hall and stuff.. when no one's there.... I like Michael Jackson. He's naturally funny too. Everything about him is natural..........  Then we went home... so i could go shopping for hoang. I like Hoang, he's all natural too. Like Breyer's Ice Cream. And we all love ice cream....  And that's my time... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.
