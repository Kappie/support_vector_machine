Although this "sample" issue is  still in  litigation, United has chosen to cancel all projects that might not be  in  compliance.  Unfortunately, your's is one of those projects. I am offering a couple  solutions:  1. If you send me a re-done master with the offending material removed,  Aardvark will re-cut and get new stampers to United at no charge.  2. If you wish, we can pull new stampers from your original cut and  send  them to a different pressing plant. Bill Smith Custom Records is one  of  these plants that is not listening to tests, and from what I can tell,  really doesn't care. A new set of stampers would run $40.00 plus  $12.50  shipping/handling. I'll waive the $12.50 shipping/handling to help out  in  this situation. United is keeping all stampers. I don't believe they  have  the legal right to do so, but fighting them would be very problematic,  waste a lot of time, and cost more in legal fees than the simple $40.00  for  replacing the stampers. I talked with Beth at United, and they haven't  made a decision about labels that they have printed. I would think  that  they should release them as there is nothing on the paper labels that  is in  violation of copyright. United is going to charge all work that they  have  done to get the project to the stage where they discovered the  "problem".  There are several pressing plants in this country. At this point,  United  is the only one that I'm aware of that has adopted this policy. I hear  that Rainbo Records in California is now looking at this policy as  well, so  they may be next.  Let me know what direction to take, and we'll work together to get this  solved. ::   Another thing | I just found out that my record bags were delivered on July 10th - I had NO fucking NOTE! I could have taken care of this a week ago. FUCK!
