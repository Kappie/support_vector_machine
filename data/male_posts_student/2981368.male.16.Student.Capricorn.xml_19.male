As in, the guy already knew everything he was meant to be talking to me about because we talked about it last lesson. Woohoo. PSE was nuts. Mat had brought in 3-4 cans of spray paint, which we kept 'borrowing' then 'testing out on the floor/chairs/desks'. Very fun. Oh, and then we found out that our Citizenship coursework is due in on the 30th (crazy 'cos we didnt even know we had any) and Mat proved that he needs help spelling. Classic examples like "shool" (school), "teatcher" (teacher) and "death treats" (death threats). So it sorta read like this: "In my coursework I will be comparing 2 articles about 2 shool boys who sent death treats to their PE teatcher." Quite funny really.  PE was also, as predicted, quite fun. Spent 45 minutes trying to teach Olly, Holly and Phil how to play squash properly, before going and beating them all at badminton. *mwahahahahahaha* After which I accidently ordered some kind of coffee from the bowls hall vending machine by randomly pressing buttons on it, then realising it still had money in *oops*, then ate as much vending machine chocolate as I could, nearly got myself stuck in that stupid little taxi thing in the Leisure Centre reception, then went down to Tescos with Holly  Sarah. At which I bought yet  more  food, this time a 5 pack of galaxy cake bars. And I also got one of them M chocice thingos from Holly. So right now I'm feeling like I've eaten waaaay too much, I'm tired and for no apparent reason my leg hurts.  On another front...Holly had some random/funny news about Nat. Between bouts of uncontrolable giggling I picked up that "shes taking the prom thing very seriously" "shes actually buying a dress" "the best way to make her dance would be to literally pick her up and carry her onto the dancefloor, then not let her go". By this point I'm starting to seriously doubt Holly's sanity. Then the  really  crazy stuff was said. The usual "awww, I'm sure she'll change her mind if I pester her some more..." "she likes you reeeeeeally...." "she'd say yes if you aaaaasked....." "goooooo oooooooon, ask heeeeeeeer....pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaassssssseee........". By which point I am wondering if I should hit her with my squash raquet...or my badminton raquet. Hmmmm. Very difficult descision there. In the end I just laughed at everything she said. Seemed to work, as she shut up about it. But yeah. For once I was actually suprised by the amount of persuasive talk she managed in that time. And I'm not easily suprised...WOW, A BLUE CAR!  Ahhhhhh.  Why can't every day be a PE double day?
