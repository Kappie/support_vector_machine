They're a pretty good band with a southern rock / blues type of garage sound. I liked it. The next band the Mooney Suzuki, was simply amazing on stage. I had downloaded some of their stuff earlier today to check them out. I wasn't impressed, but man their stage show is pure entertainment. Every member of the band was jumping up and down and crawling on stuff... even the drummer! The jam session between the lead singer and the rythm guitarist was jaw dropping. There was seriously electricity in the air when they played! The  Hives  was awesome too. It was a great set that featured a cool light up Hives sign... (although I think the =W= one looks cooler). My only issue was with them talking too much. They were only on stage 45 minutes... which is short for a headlining band, and the fact that they talked so much cut it shorter. They closed with my personal favorite "A.K.A.I.D.I.O.T."  Good fun!  ***
