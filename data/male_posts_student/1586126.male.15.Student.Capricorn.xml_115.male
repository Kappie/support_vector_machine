I found out that my graphics design teacher is sorta deaf, so he uses an earphone. Ooops. Maybe that was why when i talked to him he didnt hear me. Heh. He also kinda doesnt like me. Maybe because im the first one to finish my Flash assignments (half an hour before someone else in the class). So he tries to find something in my work that's wrong. He makes me do layers and rename layers. He also tells me to delete frames and do it again but the short way. Ok, well, at least thats better than getting a 50 on the first class of the year.  I went with Gay J over to the library and we practised our graffiti sigs. My graffiti nick is SoulLess. I also liked Stiffy. It sounds cool, but I like SoulLess best. Where did i get SoulLess from? From Muse - Newborn. There's one part in the lyrics that say: soulless is everywhere. They're not talking about me, but if they were, It would mean that I'm everywhere hehe.
