We told our kids we'd get the big kids back on Thursday.  Wednesday was the Bronx Zoo trip, which should have been hell but I only had three kids.  Can you say relief?  Then today we really went overboard with the water fight at the start of the day.  Nigel, Steve and Me went ahead of our camp over to meadowlands (which is just across the street and parking lot, but they stay in the teen center so our two camps don't see each other).  Nigel gets the idea to drive over, and Steve let him drive the car up the hill.  We got the people by suprise, but they were getting ready to attack us so we got wet.  So we run back to Steve's car, but we forgot to lock the doors... So Steve's car got soaked, as well as the three of us.  Then our campers came over, it was hectic for a while.  Then we went back to camp.   The Trio (of us) tried to do another sneak attack, but the co-director mike yelled at us, and said Big Kate (she's Mr. Brady's second in command, while Little Kate is the director.  This has nothing to do with their size, Big Kate isn't physically large) had yelled at him for us doing the sneak attacks on each other.  Regardless it was late in the day, and we didn't figure we had the time for an organized water fight.  So we just let camp fizzle out, until one of my campers said he lost his shoes.  The kid was slow so I wasn't sure if his shoes really had been stolen.  It ends up two kids did take them, and I had to talk to their parents....  Whatever.  I still don't know why I'm feeling stress.  I'm almost done with the 2nd Euro book, and I have plenty of time to write the two essays.  Besides that all I have to do in the next month is do the first two chapters of the AP Statistics book (although I've yet to crack the book open).  Oooh! My paycheck came (3rd one) it was for $240!!! Great stuff.  Hmmm.... Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas looks hot.  Go to gamespot.com, and read the preview, I mos def want to preorder it.  Not much else to say.  I saw a showing of Afro-Punk is going to be in South Manhattan on the 19th.  I need to find someone to go with now.
