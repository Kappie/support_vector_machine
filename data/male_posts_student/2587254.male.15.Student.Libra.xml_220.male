Now type in what you need to search for....you might want a space....nono don't have to backspace....wait....yeah...sorta...I think that's it..."   ....two hours of today was spent doing that, and stuff that resembles that. I'm getting better at doing this whole tech tutor shabang now though I think =). Everything seems to click now, and people aren't as hard to work with on the computer as I thought it would have been. So yeah, after working here for 4 weeks, I'm actually beginning to enjoy my job....when I'm actually doing something. The moments of the shift where there's no helpless person in need of help...  YEESH CAN IT GET BORING.  So I sat there for my shift of two hours, reading the papers when I wasn't helping someone, and helping people when I wasn't reading the papers. Dream Team got wrecked by the Italians haha, and apparently the Jays pulled another win out. Also apparently there's this full body swimsuit from Speedo that costs $500 bucks that people are actually going to use at the Olympics. Yup, the news these days. Oh yeah and cell phones are more popular then ever. Anyways, on top of the helping and reading when I was bored out of my mind, I also saw Steph Bourdage there. Apparently she was volunteerin' too. Also I finally got my long-awaited volunteer shirt.  So getting back from volunteering, I returned 50 First Dates on my way home, and also bought some food at Angelo's. Then came home, ate, and SCed for a bit, and drummed. After mom was finally done watching her baat poh shows, I then continued watching Enemy at the Gates, as I still wasn't done it. Watched up to some part, and then went to work out for a bit.  Coming home from working out, I am now blogging, chatting, and just finished eating. Rubbing in the fact that Roddick lost to Federer at the Masters or whatever  to Gloria is funny haha. Also still trying to plan out what I'm going to do when I'm out in Toronto, and wondering what tomorrow's meeting with WLAC will be like. I hope it will work out well.  Anyways that's it for today I suppose ehehe.  Later.
