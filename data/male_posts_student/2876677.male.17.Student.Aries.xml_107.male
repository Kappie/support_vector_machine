I want to learn how to play(well) because tonight was wicked fun.  Then I spent forever looking for shorts, but I couldn't find any I cared for.  I did buy three new shirts though.  Not anything I need.  I have no idea where to put all my t-shirts.  I never have enough dress pants/shirts but that is just because I can never find ones I like...or they are $90.  Shorts either.  Well, in seasons past I have never had trouble finding shorts but this year I just don't like the styles.  I would just wear pants all the time but that can get hot and they don't allow for great range of motion for tennis which I now love and need to learn how to play well.  Volleying is definitely my thing although returning looks like it could be fun.  I.  Heart.  Tennis.
