(old) tsunami bomb is rad.  10th grade  - i was now into such bands as chocking victim, leftover crack, indk, morning glory, hot snakes, and many others, i cant even name them all. i had also started getting into more "hardcore" punk like a global threat, bands of that nature. this is where i started straying from the path: along with punk, i had started getting into old rock stuff like acdc, the beatles, guns n roses, maybe thats it. i love acdc though. i had also gone to a get get go show the summer after sophmore year which sparked my love for hardcore/noise. get get go, archeopterix, blood brothers, the locust, its all good, gotta love that noise. i also got into the kindof weird indie stuff i.e. fugazi, the mars volta, and some psychobilly: tiger army, mad sin, batmobile, mad heads, nekromantix; these bands led to rockabilly, which was really found at a phenomenauts show at the phoenix that summer.   last year  - now i was well-immersed in the hardcore/noise stuff but i wasnt quite all in there yet. a friend of mine introduced me to converge the summer earlier and, shit, theyre one of my favorite bands. they led to other hXc acts such as orchid and, well, thats it i think. now that i had some  real  hXc under my belt it was time to move to the next level - the postal service? yeah, i was online and found an electronic emo band called the postal service. theyre great and they led to my emo phase: death cab, mineral, bright eyes, coldplay, capn jazz, iron and wine, mates of state. shit im emo nowadays. now with the emo came more hXc: botch, as i lay dying, circle takes the square, the black dahlia murder, and american nightmare/giveuptheghost (RIP). from the postal service came other pseudo electronic bands like the notwist, kindof half electronic. then i found amon tobin. he is the greatest. shit i love his stuff. recently its been all about the velvet teen, amon tobin,as i lay dying, the cure, the postal service, madness, and owls. see what im listening to now? emo and electronic and hardcore and ska. its all from punk. gotsta love punk and the dumb little punk kid in all of us.  fuckin shit i love music. im a fuckin music junkie, its horrible but awesome at the same time.  gotta love the rockinest most rock-steady beat of madness!!!
