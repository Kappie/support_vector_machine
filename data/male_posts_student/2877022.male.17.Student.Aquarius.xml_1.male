Think sooner or later muz buy copyrights for them le. hee, hope anyone of u ppl would be famous for ur talents, so that i could sell this link to publishers. $$$  Just to let the class know: i'm holding a post in the band. So, any interested classmate can take over my post as CIP rep le. unless there isn't anyone, den i have to do the job, k? Basically, being CIP rep is good. You get to learn to organise activities with  STRANGERS.  (funny rite? mum actually taught me not to tok to strangers. so this job is highly dangerous)  juz for u all to kaypoh. The way i got this exco post is god damn  dramatic .  Nobody knows their positioning in terms  of the number of votes except for me!!! i'm 9th. Why? i was selected after one of the 8 new excos decide not to take up the job! it was DRAMATIC. i cant tahan my life animore. I HATE  DRAMAS ! Why make it so special that i must be given a "solo" timeslot to be introduced? Making me a surprise to everyone, even the year 2s also don't know it prior to the announcment.   By the way, i wanna formally thank everyone from 04S08 who have made contributions to this class blog. Without me, there wouldn't be a blog. Without your support, there wouldn't be a  class blog .
