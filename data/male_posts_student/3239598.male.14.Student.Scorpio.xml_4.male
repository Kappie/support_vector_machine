"Comfort the disturbed.  Disturb the comfortable."  3.) "I'm not spoiled.  I just get my way.  ALLLL the time."  4.) "Well, fine!  I'm making this ******* webpage for you, you could at least put a song in there for me."  5.)"When I cry, you can't hear me because I'm screaming.  It's mostly because I don't get my way."  6.)"I'm gonna have resposibilities when I get older.  That is gonna so suck."  7.) MICHAEL: Is there really a man on the moon?      BRANDON: (sarcastic tone) Yes, Michael.  There is a guy living on the moon.      MICHAEL: You never know...  8.) Now, whoever thought the moon was made of cheese?  Like, seriously!  9.) You can be the center of the universe, as long as the world revolves around me."   I shall update this page as more isms become available.  ~JACK SPARROW~
