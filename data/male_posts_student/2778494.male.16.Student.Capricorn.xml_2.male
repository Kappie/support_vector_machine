The two team were Columbus County and Brunswick County. These guys were good. They spend countless hours perfecting their game so that they may become the next World Series champs. Columbus County came away with the victory, and they are heading to Dallas, NC for the State Tournament in a few more days. After the game, i came home around 8:30.   //My phone connection has been acting very odd in the last two days. Ever since the storm yesterday afternoon, my satellite receivers have been trying to dial into DirecTV, and I guess they havent succeeded yet. My phone stays busy then it acts ok. thirty minutes later it does the same thing. i was very frustrated after spending an hour figuring out the problem, so i finally unplugged the three receivers. AHH, that probably made no since.  //Spent the rest of the night downloaded copyrighted things. Found a new site that helped my find more people to download from. So, im happy because i can download faster and more things. Right now, i am downloading 14 albums, 5 movies, and 2 games. I love Torrent files.  //I thought i was going to be leaving tonight to go to South Carolina, but it turns out that i am leaving tommorow morning. i had to leave a post. Its probably gonna be monday before i do it again. You guys are probably glad that i will be gone for a while. hehe. Yall take care. lata.++++++
