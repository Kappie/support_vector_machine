Last nite, I was talking a stroll on the street with my dad and brother, after meeting my mom's side(relative). It wasn't a good visits, cos everyone is blaming me for imgrating to Australia, while my brother chooses another destiny path for his life. Dad just tagging along with us.  Lord, what does this mean... Soon after a kilometers of walks, we met an accident, killing both of my loves. I am really feel depressed and sad. They just left me alone to finishes the stroll to the end of the gate.   Sound familiar, right? This is like my current situation in Australia. I am living on my own two feet, walking toward to the end of the gate. my destiny path is still a long way to walk . I need a person to walk me home, with the background from Mandy's song ...   Walk me home,  I dunn all the way alone.... Baby, will you take my hand, baby, come to a special place ...  And, I am still typing all the way....  I have to bath, get ready for the journey to Jervis Bay, near Nowra. I am going to watch the miggration of whales !!! I say again WHALES !!!! I never seen whales before... Lord , please please , let's me see the Whales, that Prophet Ayob took..  Whales is one of the magificent creatures, Lord have created. And one of the creatures, that have play a part in Islamic's history. Insya-Allah, he will allowed me to see one of the greatest earth creature, with a pleasant journey.
