Well, most recently there was this thing called "halloween" that went on.  This is MY holiday, because I like trying to decorate the porch for the trick or treaters from around town.  I don't decorate the entire house, just the porch because that's all they see anyway.  But anyways, It's a basic set up of some black lights, a strobe light if available, and some other decorative touches that may come to mind like spider webbing, black light reflective stuff, and stuff of that nature.  Well, this year (2003) it just so happens I'm not home to do this.  Last year (2002) I was @ SIPI and was homesick all kinds around this time of year.  Not around thanksgiving, but halloween is when I was most homesick?  Now, Thanksgiving, that's pretty dumb.  I've touched on this before on the native hip hop site.  But, Thanksgiving is a stupid holiday that I don't really get into.  Our family is so scattered these days that a gathering of it requires setting something up so far in advance it's crazy.  We used to just do it on a whim, or a mutual agreeing, but lately everyone has other plans and that's cool.  We just usually have some turkey, cranberries, pie, stuffing, and mashed potatoes.  If I'm not satisfied, I just cruise around to other places and dip my appetite in what they may still have around.  The cool thing is that I may not be invited to their gatherings, but am still welcomed to show up if I can.  Christmas:  again, we don't really get into it.  There's no decorations, no christmas tree, no candles, no carolling, just a spot on the ground to put the presents, if there are any.  Usually there's a couple, but for me, there aren't many, if any.  I'm not big on that though.  I usually am not financially fit to buy things for folks either, so it's like I get what I give.  Most of the time, I can only offer a smile and a hug.  Sometimes, that's all some people need?  Or, I'm just saying that to make myself feel better for the lack of material offerings I have to give.  Columbus day: what a joke!  Native American Day:  Seems like an excuse to take a day off to me, that is, for tribal employees.  Veterans Day:  This has some significance for me now.  Before though, I didn't understand things like I do now.  It's not the numerous movies available, or the history lessons I've long forgotten that gives this day significance.  No, it's actually the craziness on the rez that gives this day some umph for me.  We lose people, and sometimes it's through gunplay, but most of the time it's through car wrecks, drug overdose, suicide, and aftereffects of long time drinking and drugs in old ages.  We go through losing our friends and family like soldiers do.  We sometimes see it first hand too.  Some people are diagnosed w/ post traumatic war syndrome and have never been in war before, but it's from growing up in the craziness that is rampant on the rez.  Some kids (That's right, KIDS!) are starting to drink to forget losing loved ones, or even so they won't have to raise their syblings because the parents are heavy into drugs, alcohol or both.  We go through some of the same things the vets went through in war, seeing our friends and family die, going w/out food for a long time, sleep deprevation, mental and physical fatigue, and also the bond of absolute trust that comes from going through the harshest of events w/ someone who was there w/ you.  This is why I look at veterans day and think it is such a worthy holiday to recognize.
