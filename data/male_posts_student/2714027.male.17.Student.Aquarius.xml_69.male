People kept saying things like "hello stranger" and "where have you been?" I only had three lessons and came home in the afternoon.  Yesterday was dedicated to a journey to Leeds which is where I am right now. All three of us (in the family) were squeezed into the Mini, leaving me in the back with enough room for my iPod and not much else. My dad also got some fairly bad news at work; his whole workplace is being shut down and all the staff are being made redundant. I say 'fairly bad' because my dad's redundancy payment will be, well, quite a lot. He won't have a job come September, but we'll be able to pay off the mortgage, credit cards and so on, with enough left over for something else. It's been quite a shock, but it'll open a lot of doors for him and could be a nice opportunity for him to do something different. What will exactly happen isn't certain, but he's definitely not the worst off in his office.  Today we went off to Leeds University's open day during a day in which the weather just couldn't decide what to do. We went off to an accommodation talk first, which proved to be similar to others we've seen with the notable fact that only just above half of the rooms have network access (many unis have almost all setup). After grabbing some lunch, we headed off to a talk at the computer science department which proved to be fairly average. There was nothing special to write home about, nothing to separate it from other unis. With all the unis I'm seeing having similar requirements and courses, each one really has to mark itself out, but Leeds didn't do that, putting it in fourth place out of the four that I've seen so far in order of preference. There was an excellent talk on Ucas forms though which will probably prove useful so the day wasn't all average.
