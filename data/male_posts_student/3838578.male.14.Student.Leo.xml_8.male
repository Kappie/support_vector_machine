One day, that Bubbles, he went to the fair. With only one sock, who believes in a pair?  He stuck out in the crowd, like a sore thumb. People called him bad names. They called him a bum.  Bubbles didn’t get discouraged; he held his head high. It was then his face that got hit by a pie.  He was pointed at, laughed at as he began to sob. When who came over, but a clown named Bob.  “Don’t be discouraged” Bob said with great glee. “We’re supposed to be funny,” just look at me.  So Bob stood up with a smile on his face. And fell to the ground as he tripped on his lace.  Bubbles then realized he had nothing to fear. For his job as a clown, was to share lots of cheer.  So as Bubbles got up and he told a great joke. As Bob fell once again, he slipped on an egg yolk.  So later that night, Bubbles was leaving the fair. He won another sock, he believed in that pair.  During that day he had made a new friend. He and Bob, they’d be clowns till the end.  But most importantly, he had learned a great rule. That when the people laugh, they don’t think you’re a fool.  They laugh and they laugh, full of great cheer. They laugh and they laugh because you filled them with jeer.   So as Bubbles went out in public, he stuck out like a thumb. But people applauded, they loved him, the silly old bum.  He wasn’t hated, not even a bit He even received a fruit-filled basket.  He jumped and he jumped, he loved his job. It was all thanks to a clown named Bob.
