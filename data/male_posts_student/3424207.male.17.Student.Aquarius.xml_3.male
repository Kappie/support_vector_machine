Don't believe the information you see in the movie? Check out Michael Moore's web site for proof of the facts in Fahrenheit 9/11. The site is http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/latestnews/f911facts/, check it out.  Also go see Fahrenheit 9/11 because it answers questions that many people have and the movie is also a big eye opener.
