If I had had my camera out at that time, it would have made a great picture. The girl's face was one of pure joy, and the old man had a kind look in his eyes. Weird how I noticed that, instead of everything else going on in the streets.   Well, I have over 100 pictures of the animals over there, and from this i'll probably end up with 10-20 quality ones xD Well, what you gonna do eh?   My computer still sounds like its going to blow up, despite two check ups from the computer guy. Those bastards are like doctors, they treat one thing and fuck up another xD
