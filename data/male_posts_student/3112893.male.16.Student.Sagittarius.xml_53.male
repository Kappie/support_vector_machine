In any event, I'm just gonna sum up what's been happening over the past few days, to what I look forward and what I dread over the next few days, and a little bit of what's on my mind. Anyway, onto the actual post...  The past few days have been almost identical in terms of what I did, thought about, and just everything, so I'll just say it once. I woke up at around 11 and read the everyday funnies, checked out the front page of new york times and compared it to foxnews.com. It's a really funny comparison, I think. I find Fox News to be incredibly sensational and lacks real content and instead replaces it with essentially an opinion or someone's "spin" on it (because they love to say that they don't any of that... right), while new york times is just sensational, occasionally lacks real content, but opinion and fact are almost always separated clearly. It also doesn't have an obvious cant to either side, left or right.  Moving on, I've been getting into Bob Dylan lately and he's kind of a god in my mind right now. There's nothing like a jewish cowboy, I say ;-) (Robert Zimmerman is his real name). My third grade teacher actually went to the same high school as him at the same time. She says she knew him and that he was a cool kid, which is just friggin' awesome. In any event, I've been really getting into his music and so far, if I had to pick a favorite song, it'd be either 'Along The Watchtower' or 'John Brown'. I like the lyrics to 'John Brown', they can be found  urlLink here . He's so cool, man. Too cool, perhaps.  In any event, I've also been playing much too much Warcraft III. I recently got frozen throne from Ali so I installed it I've been going through the campaigns. I'm on the undead one now, chapter 4 I think. For those who know the game, it's the level where you land on the beach and you have to kill a blood elf base before a base can be established. Anyway, I've been playing too much and that's been buggin' my head. I'm getting kind of sick of the game though so I think I'll be fine by the end of the week. That game has horrible replay value. SC is a lot more fun in terms of replaying it. That's just my opinion though.  On a happy note, I've been playing my guitar a bit and it's been fun, as usual. It's funny, I think, how whenever I do a guess the song, I mess up like 5 times in the recording, but just days, sometimes even hours later, I play it flawlessly. It's kind of frustrating, but maybe I mess up because I'm nervous :-[.  Speaking of things that make me nervous and awkward, I've been staying up to wee hours of the morning every morning for the past long while talking to a certain someone on AIM. I enjoy it... a lot. It's, quite honestly, the best part of my day and I've been wondering what I'm gonna do when she goes to florida with no internet connection >_  Another topic that I'm not too comfortable with, but one that's a relatively big part of my life now is cleaning the house up and preparing it for Andrew and Anandita. Ya know, when I went into my old room and cleaned up and emptied it's remaining contents into my sister's old room, which is being used a temporary "put your random and to-be-sorted crap here" room, I sat on the bench that's now in there and nearly broke into tears. It's really depressing to leave this place for me. Just thinking about not ever really seeing it again makes me immensely depressed and a little angry, but I try not to let either overtake me. I mean, I lived in this apartment for 5 years and I have a lot of memories of just... stuff that's happened here. I guess it would have happened eventually though. I mean, it is, after all, an apartment and we don't own the place, but I wish it could have been after I went to college. We, my immediate family, still don't have a house or piece of land or anything to call our own, so I guess until we buy something, I'll be doomed to painful moving experiences from apartment to apartment. This stupid knot in my throat is making my typing very difficult...  Moving on, the weather in Boston is really humid and a bit hot so no matter how much I bathe, I will always feel disgusting. I developed a heat rash on my chest and back a couple days back that lasted a day or so and it kinda freaked me out, but it's gone now. I've asked myself this many times, and I still have no real idea what the answer is: Why in god's name, would anyone set up a colony in a place like this with crappy weather and soggy land, despite the innumerable previous failed attempts to colonize it? It boggles my mind.  I get my retainer tomorrow morning at 8:45, which means that I either have to go bed really early tonight, which I don't think I will, or stay up all night and go in the morning. I think I'll end up doing the latter just because it's a bit easier for me and the sleep schedule I have now. When I go there, they're also gonna look at my molars and check if I have any cavities because I called the orthodontist's office up today and said that I'm no extremely sensitive to cold, and moderately sensitive to hot foods, and not that it's new, but I'm also sensitive to citrus. My teeth suck, I know. Anyway, they said that it's normal for teeth to be sensitive for a few weeks or months because of the bands that wrap around the molars protect 'em and make 'em kinda wimpy. So, they're gonna take a look and let me know tomorrow. I hope it's nothing too bad :-\.  I'm lonely right now, but it's not because I'm staying in the old house alone. I feel lonely no matter where I am or who I'm with. It's really crappy and a little more than a little clich√©, but I just feel like I'm missing something or someone in my life. I don't know what it is, but whenever I think about it, my heart does this weird thing it does where it feels like it sinks in my chest and it's a yucky feeling that I remember getting in certain situations with Shannon. I don't know anymore. Why -- no, What -- na', How -- shit, I don't even know what the question that I'm trying to ask myself is. I'm horribly confused, but god forbid I show it to the world in person. Everyone would try to "help" me by asking questions I've already asked myself and run through 400 times from the 5+ personalities/perspectives in my head. I'm sorry, I don't really WANT to let this out, but for some reason, I feel I should. Thanks for reading this far, anyway.  Tomorrow I'm gonna finally do some more math. I have a three-quarter-hearted goal to reach so I'd better put 135% into it, maybe it'll make up for my lack of enthusiasm, or perhaps even create it. Who am I to complain though? My life is good for the most part. I have a family that loves me and calls everyday just to hear my voicemail greeting and I'm sitting here, on top of the world, and yet I still manage to find something to whine about. I've got food and a roof over my head and I don't have to worry about my country breaking out into civil war anytime soon... Or do I :-P?  Anyway, I could go on and on trying to justify my complaints, but I just don't see the real reason in them anymore. I came up with those arguments for the point a year or so ago and it's just old to me now. It served it's purpose and I feel like they're not valid anymore because they're old. It's stupid. I know it's almost the same exact scenario and the argument still holds true, but I can't bring myself to see it as valid. What's worse is that I CAME UP WITH THE ARGUMENT MYSELF! AKH!  Anyway, I think I've whined enough. I'd be amazed if you actually read this far, and I thank you very much.  That is all. -- Feanor
