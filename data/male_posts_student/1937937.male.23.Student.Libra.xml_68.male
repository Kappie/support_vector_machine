I haven't been this interested in fame in years, but when you start to rediscover old friends, that desire kicks in: the burning yearning to be incredibly famous... the "did you hear what  Rob Barry  did?" syndrome.  I think it comes from having a well known dad.  I mean, I'm sure everyone wants to be famous (unless they're spiritually connected), but I  really  want recognition sometimes.  I love that I know that!  Why else would I write a blog?  My internet soiree today led me to Ridley Pearson, and I suddenly remembered that he used to date Richard Dreyfuss's ex-wife.  That reminded me of a certain girl who I knew.  A stunning girl, really, even at 11.  I was 14.  So I searched the internet, and discovered that she still exists.  Not only does she exist, but everything I found about her mentioned that she has a lot of sex.  Now that was amusing.  Pooka gets spayed tomorrow.  She's excited -- we're cleaning the house tonight so she can come home and just relax. The point is to do the most with the least doing being done.
