The snowpack melted considerably, people were outside playing sports, and everyone in general was in a much better mood. The best part about spring is how layers of clothing begin coming off. Walking to class today, I saw some girls in tank-tops and I thought to myself, "Damnnn, where have YOU been all winter?!"   Springtime is great and it only gets better from here.  -BIGsmut.  P.S. What's the opposite of Christopher Reeves?  Christoper Walken!  (I'm probably going to hell for that.)
