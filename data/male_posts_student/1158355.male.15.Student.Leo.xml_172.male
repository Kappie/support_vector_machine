Drum lesson #2 and I got this cool new drum pad with these cool fat bobby sticks. I call them bobby, because they have little bobs on the tips. Ok so anyways...I've been procrastinating and not doing my homework so I think I'm gonna do that now...what 7 more days until the anniversary? Wow. Hey I started with wow and ended with wow. Wait, now I have to write wow again...WOW.
