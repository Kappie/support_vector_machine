It was fantastic, if there is one bit of advise that every person should take it's to not set boundaries, heck, I was applying for a job on the spirit of tasmania, a cruise ship down here in Australia. I'm 16 and applying for a job on a high-class cruise ship. Forget what's acceptable, what is normal for your age, go out and reach for what you want, what do you have to lose. The stuff I got to do at The Theatre Royal was average, but just being there was fantastic. I guess I've gone there in the past and I've seen magic, I've seen people become who they are not, seen the impossible. To be there, right where they stood, where that magic came from nothing. I guess it's not the actual theatre that I'm attracted to, it's the people, it just amazes me that they can transform themselves to someone that doesn't exist. And all the backstage people are just so happy, all the time, yeah it's stressful, but what job isn't.  I say, go live your life, no-ones gonna stop you. Reach for what you want, forget about "keeping your options open". Each person has an average of 4 career changes in their life, if you don't like what you're doing, quit the job, go find something fun, something that you love. If you really want to do something, they will hire you, if you truly believe that you can do this, and if you really want it, The people will see that. I have never prepared for an interview, I figure, they're interviewing me, not some, "here's one I prepared earlier" kinda person.  And hey, you may think, oh, he thinks he's so good at writing all this junk, so be it, I do not care if you think either way, because, frankly, this is me, this is who I am and this is what I believe. Those who like me, thanx for taking the time to read, for those who don't, the same to you.     Go be you, forget about what people might think. Say hi to every person you meet, it may be the only chance you get. Live life and go for what you want.
