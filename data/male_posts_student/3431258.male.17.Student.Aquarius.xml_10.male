Escaped with my brother, hell it was a bit boring. I searched for wanderley everywhere, did'nt find him.   Also played a lot of Tetris today. I did'nt play it for more than a year. I found a couple of different version wich will now live inside my hard drive. The picture you see is the  neave  version of tetris ( Check ancients posts for url, it's free). I also digged up  Tetris 4000  wich is very nice. I just finished downloading  Tetris Master , i will have a look at it in a few minutes.   Did a bit of Photoshop tutorials yesterday. I will post some of my works tommorow, check back!  Regards,  Zephyr
