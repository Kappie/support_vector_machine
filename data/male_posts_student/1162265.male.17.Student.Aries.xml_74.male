Not that it really matters, I hate band.  Yeah so whatever.  The trip.  Got there Friday night just slept.  Then Saturday was Mall day.  Went to Tysons Corner supposedly the 8th biggest mall in the United States.  It's in North VA.  We stayed till about four, went to this Sea food place that I haven't been to in years.  Food was good as always, but I ate to much.  I had a bowl of Chowder, and then a sample of fried flounder, fried cod, and fried shrimp.  After that I felt like I was gonna die, and sink into Hell.  So we went back to the Hotel, then dad took us out to the crowded Mall in Baltimore to get Ice Cream.  Needless to say it was ungodly crowded.  Anyway we got our Ice Cream, and we got to see some weird Austrialian preformer preforming in the preforming space.  Sure he was talented but the drunk black kids made it good!  It was funny seeing some of the people around them edge away, and then leave.  Next day, which is technically today.  We checked out.  Drove to my Aunt Vivians, who I'd never met before, and got the added bonus of meeting my Uncle Carlos, and his family.  Also got to play the new Matrix game there.  I want to pick that up tommorow, it has footage of Jada that wasn't in the Movie, and everyone looooves Jada.  Anyway, we left and drove down to DC which was like 10 minutes away, to check out Howard.  It was in the middle of the real Chocalate City that they don't want to show tourist.  Damn, the area around the college looked worse then any part of Newark I've ever seen.  But Howard is still cool, and I want to really go there.    That's pretty much the extent of my trip.  It was a short one, but good.
