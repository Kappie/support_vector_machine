We reached there at 2.00 p.m. and bought the 5.00 p.m. tickets (THX). We killed time by playing Need for Speed: Underground and FIFA Soccer 2004 in a gaming store. When our time runs out, we played Time Crisis II at the arcades.  Spider-Man 2 is great. It may not have as much action as the first, but the story provides more depth into Peter's emotions and problems. I just SO wish that the next movie will feature Venom (though I think this is impossible).  Bought two Penyiasat Remaja comics after that and a Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children wall-scroll.  My friend invited me to his house today to play PS2 (at my time of posting) but my mom asked me to study instead. Oh well~ I'll be doing my Maths homework and BM essay after I finished typing this, which will be ended with a full-stop.  Last Wednesday, when I finished my school's co-curricular activities, I noticed that the north sky is filled with dark clouds and the south sky is bright and surrounded by white clouds. It kind of make me feel that the world will never have a pure good or evil side, that the world must always have a balance of Yin and Yang, Good and Evil, Light and Dark.
