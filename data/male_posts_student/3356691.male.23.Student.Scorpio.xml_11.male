This is actually not new, for a long time Dell outsourced its calls to local companies that did the hiring and firing and training, the service was actually better than Dell reps alot of times. Then Dell decided to "cut costs" and started outsourcing their calls to India, support has definitly gone down. I really don't have a problem with sending jobs somewhere else, I think it helps the global economy, but if your job is to talk on the phone having a heavy accent is usually not a good idea.  Recently Dell had to pull a large amount of it's support from India because a super large corporate customer was threating to switch because the support was so bad. But don't get confused, if you are not a huge company, chances are your call is going most of the way around the world.
