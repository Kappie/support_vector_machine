Guess what! my car is dying :( it keeps over heating so i cant drive it until it gets fixed *tear*. it first happened when me and stephanie were taking a tire iron to ryan who had a flat, i noticed my heat gage was all the way in the red (around 300 degrees for all of you that dont know) and my car began to smoke. long story short it happened 2 days in a row so now i cant drive.   Today i had to go to the doctor and get my toenail cut out again, i realized if i wasnt so stupid and would stop dropping boxes and getting my feet smashed this would never happen. yeah it was easy, this is the second time ive had to get it done. The procedure goes as follows: Step 1) Get 2 shots into your toe knuckle causing it to swell and go numb. Step 2) Get scissors and chop off all the skin around the nail. Step 3) Get very sharp scissors and pull the nail out of this skin causing blood to drip everywhere. Step 4) wrap up toe and walk around for 4 hours with a swollen toe. Thats about everything.  I have to work tonight 5-8 grrr. i dont like to work, i feel everyone should get paid for living. i mean come on being alive and being a teenager is the hardest job ever. not to mention all the money we require to live. I think that we should get paid $10 an hour for being a kid. and we get paid every day at 8 o'clock at night. that would be cool.  Warped tour is 6 days away! Alkaline Trio here i come!  "Smoke it down Until you smell the flesh burning from your finger tips You're knuckles are white From beating on the walls at night Cast your worries to the side Focus only when you get the time Gonna lose your mind It happens all the time  Maybe I can tell you To keep your head up and follow through Good things will come to you I could worry myself to death about you Hope you get there safely"
