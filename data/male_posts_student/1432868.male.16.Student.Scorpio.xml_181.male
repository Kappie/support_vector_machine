Tried to get a party together...but failed miserably (didn't try that hard and 2, I hate planning stuff) Ray couldn't come cuz of Ramadan and Mellissa just never called me back. the other people I would have gotten from them. oh well. Going to NYC this weekend gonna go see  The Phantom of the Opera  on Broadway and then go visit my friends in New York. ( maybe even see IMAX version of Matrix: Reloaded which btw comes out tomorrow....The day we don't have a half day. :-\
