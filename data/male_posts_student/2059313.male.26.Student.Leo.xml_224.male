Frithjof Schwesig, vicar in the southwestern town of Lampoldshausen, had ordered 300 copies of a video film portraying the life of Christ as told by the gospel according to Luke.  "In a first batch 20 to 30 videos were distributed and we immediately got a reaction from five to seven people saying we must have given them the wrong film," he said.  "It was a real porn film. Within an hour our staff had collected all the videos. Really, all were withdrawn."  Schwesig said there had been a mistake at the Munich video copying plant and his staff established in a viewing session that night that 200 of the videos were pornographic.  Undaunted, Schwesig said he was pressing ahead with the life of Christ video campaign.  "It's extremely successful," he said.
