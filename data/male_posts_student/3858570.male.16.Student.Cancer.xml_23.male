Anywayz im drivin across the river 2morrow, i thought i was gonna see Joe for the first time in a year, unfourtunatly he made plans and you know whatever. Im goin over there because im goin fishin' on Saturday and im sleepin over at my cousins house (i get to tryout my new fishin pole yay!).  So anyway i need yall to wish me luck on 3 things: 1. My drive across the river 2. I catch some frikin fish 3. I get better at Rainbow Six3: Black Arrow
