I've finished a few custom programs, and now I'm reading "My Life" by Bill Clinton. It is quite interesting, and I have to say that critics have been way too harsh. It's an interesting read. I've watched the democratic convention live feed, and I've head quite a lot, and the case against bush is mounting! Watch Kerry's acceptance speach here :  http://mfile.akamai.com/12294/asf/dncc.download.akamai.com/12294/07292004/john_kerry_100.asf  Lately i've been going to sleep even later then usual so I'm somewhat more tired then usual.  Bored to death. If you have any idea of wht to do, or just want to drop by, feel free to do so.
