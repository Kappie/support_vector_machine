Well it shall be what it shall be the fight wil be fought and we just hope that things will turn out for the best. Time to say a prayer as the fear grows inside...  Well we may have grin and bear it... we may have to carry on... We shall see but this feeling of my life being in the hands of others is far too familiar... last time it wasn't a pretty sight... last time it wasn't a pretty sight.  Mood: down... yet having some hope.
