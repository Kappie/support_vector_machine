The Washington Post is read by people who think they run the country.   3.  The New York Times is read by people who think they should run the  country and who are very good at crossword puzzles.   4.  USA Today is read by people who think they ought to run the country but  don't really understand The New York Times.  They do, however, like their  statistics shown in pie charts.   5.  The Los Angeles Times is read by people who wouldn't mind running the  country - if they could find the time - and if they didn't have to leave  Southern California to do it.   6.  The Boston Globe is read by people whose parents used to run the country  and did a far superior job of it, thank you very much.   7.  The New York Daily News is read by people who aren't too sure who's  running the country and don't really care as long as they can get a seat on  the train.   8.  The New York Post is read by people who don't care who's running the  country as long as they do something really scandalous, preferably while  intoxicated.   9.  The Miami Herald is read by people who are running another country but  need the baseball scores.   10. The San Francisco Chronicle is read by people who aren't sure there is a  country... or that anyone is running it; but if so, they oppose all that  they stand for.  There are occasional exceptions if the leaders are  handicapped minority feminist atheist dwarfs who also happen to be illegal  aliens from any other country or galaxy, provided of course, that they are  not Republicans.   11. The National Enquirer is read by people trapped in line at the grocery  store.  He sent more stuff; I'll post that later.
