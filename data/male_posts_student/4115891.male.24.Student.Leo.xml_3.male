There are many structural and technical errors but I could care less ;)       Crazy Karl: A Quick Noir   Nothing he had done in the recent past could have warranted this.  The deception and the lies, the demands and the guilt, the complacency and sloth were all eating at him.  Their acidity leaching away his body like the rain leached the stone statues in the park.  Sometimes he thought he could see himself melting under her barrage.  Skin sluffing off, oozing into a pool on the floor, unable to recombine or move.  He was bent to her will, and that was that.  Once she had told him “I want very little only your complete obedience and unwavering loyalty.  Small demands, that’s it. Oh yeah” she added with a smooth grin that seemed to dare him to resist, “you sleep in the wet spot.”     Life had been unkind to him.  Or so he thought.  He had married at to too young an age, and had remained married for too long to this villain.  Nothing now could assuage the anger that flooded through his veins and pored from his eyes like two almond shaped waterfalls of despair loneliness and hatred.  Nothing could be done now, he thought, no nothing.  He had chosen this course, he had invested in it, and he had spread his roots in the dark rich soil of angst, now he would grow in it.  He looked at the object in his hand.  It was ugly, short, and squatty.  He wondered if it would work.  It was not very big.  What if he missed or it didn’t do the job.  A botched job would definitely not do.  It must be clean and instant, it must go right, as right as a thing like this could be in any case.  This was a single action of hate, destruction, impurity and yet to him it seemed right.  Horribly right…  To himself it was an act of cruel kindness.  The bundle lay quietly.  Wrapped in a thick cotton comforter and lumped with fluffy down pillows that had the evening before resided on his side of the bed.  There was nothing to it.  There was no face, no humanity, only blanket and pillows.  Blanket and pillows, blanket and pillows, he thought trying to remove all bastions of humanity that lingered in his cerebellum and bellow the sheets.  Don’t think about it just…  “BOOM!!!!”  Shoot.  It was done.  A small hole singed into the blue flower comforter, a couple if down feathers and a lifeless corps beneath.  And above it he stood, the winner, the living, in smoky glory.    “What have you done?”  The words came to him in a whisper.  With a sense of urgency that seemed to pierce the gravity of the situation.    “Karl, what are you doing?”    The words were not his now.  They were soft and demanding, the canter, and the timbre was unmistakably feminine.  The voice belonged to the dead.    “What are you doing?” it insisted.    It came from behind him and he spun to face it.  An outline, a painting: “Woman In Nightgown”, stood in the bathroom door.    “I said what are you doing?  Are you crazy?” she approached him like a menacing beast ready to spring upon prey.    He pointed the weapon between her gleaming eyes…  Click… Click… Click… Click…  They were empty.  There was no furry left in the chambers.  He only had one bullet, and that was in the bed.  Damn his luck.  He should have bought more, though he had no idea how.  He had found the gun in an alley on the way home from work  and thought he should tell the police.  He had reached for his cellular and began dialing. 9-1…  His briefcase opened and the gun slipped inside.    “Operator” said a voice on the other end “what is your emergency?”    “Sorry, nothing.” He had replied. “It was an accident.” 	 His wife stood before him, unhurt and unflinching.  A scowl smeared across her face which sent wrinkles darting across her cheeks towards her ears.      “That’s it!” She proclaimed.  “You’re seeing the doctor tomorrow, a head doctor.”  Numbness shot from his face through his neck and into his body.  The warm steal of the revolver dripped with sweat.  He eased his fingers and let it fall to the floor.  The room swam around and seemed to suck him into the current of her menacing presence.  He felt himself melting, his knees gave and he collapsed onto the bed.  She flashed a grin at the pitiful sight, spun about and paced toward the bedroom door.    “Oh, and Karl” she interjected “your sleeping on the bullet hole.”  Copyright by Kevin Ford 2004
