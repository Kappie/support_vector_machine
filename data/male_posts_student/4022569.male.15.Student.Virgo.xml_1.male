It's hard to say I'll be ok,   The truth is I'm reelin' of all this pain and I know why.      'Cause sometimes we all need a little love life.      All our hearts go through joy and strife.    But,   I wanna be your shining light!   Be the first star you see at night!   Just say that you'll be my love life!       Kept prayin I didn't need you.   Kept hoping I was right.   I wish you knew you're still my mind.   I guess it's something you left behind.   maybe we're meant to be this time.      'Cause sometimes we all need a little love life. All our hearts go through joy and strife. But, I wanna be your shining light! Be the first star you see at night! Just say that you'll be my love life!       Ohhhhh love life, a little love li----ife       Maybe someday I'll see,    That you were just playin' me,   This won't last,   It's over its passed,    And I placed last,       'Cause sometimes we all need a little love life.   All our hearts go through joy and strife.    But I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time!   Known you weren't going to love me right!   That's why this my love life my love life!       Ohhhhh love life, a little love li----ife
