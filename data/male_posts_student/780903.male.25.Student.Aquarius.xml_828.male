She'd been drinkin' too much egg-nog, That's a fact we're gonna hide. Though she forgot her medication, It's Santa's fault that Grandma almost died.  When we found her Christmas morning, At the scene of the attack,  I said we'll get her Santa's workshop, By next year he'll be living in a shack.  (chorus)  Now we're all so proud of Grampa,  He's the witness that we need, Although he did not see what happened, "Why, Santa's sleigh was off at quite a speed!"  It's not Christmas without Grandma, We're all emotion'lly distressed, On CNN, we're gathered watching, As they all search for Santa to arrest.  (chorus)  I hear he's hired Johnnie Cochrane He's gonna say the sleigh don't fit But Santa left behind a reindeer With Comet here, it's harder to acquit  Next year we'll be sitting pretty, With a lien on Santa's sleigh We're gonna let him stay in business But we'll get our toys FIRST on Christmas Day.
