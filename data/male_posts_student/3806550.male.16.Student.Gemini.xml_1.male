That I should conflict with current faults and disapate the cold harsh reality of the present? Should I move on towards it? With this Unbreakable bond and concentrated emotion of bliss tells me to enable my opinions towards it and progress towards it. Well, the only way of telling so is to wait. Maybe just maybe. .
