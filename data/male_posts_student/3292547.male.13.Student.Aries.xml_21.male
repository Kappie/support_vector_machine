Next year I'll be the one walking across the stage instead of playing music while they march into their seats and then goig off to the side and sitting while about a hundred names are called. Sounds fun huh?  So it's 3:30 now.... that about 2 hours and a half. Now to count them down while I been my latest book  The Eye of the World  by  Robert Jordan . I'll have to tell you about it later. It's a 814 page book, and I'm on page 366. When I'm done I'll tell you how it was. Anyway, that's all I can think about writing. Today wasn't too eventfull. Well.... off I go.
