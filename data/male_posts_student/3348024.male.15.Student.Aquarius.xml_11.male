So, first we were just fucking around and there was really nothing to do so Amber and I went out and sat in her mom's car until her mom yelled at us and told us "that we weren't being paid to sit in a car."  We then went inside, where, as predicted, there was nothing for us to do.  So apparently we were being paid to stand around doing nothing, but it is forbidden to sit in a car and do nothing.  So after standing around for a while doing nothing the reception started and we started serving food to people.  I got the baked beens, which were at the back which means when people got to me of course there was either only one spot or no spots left on their plates.  Apparently some of them still needed to tell me where to put it.  "Put it right there buddy."  I'm thinking, "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, you are a jackass.  Where the fuck else would I put the damn beans."  Then there were the people who tried to get special orders.  "Hey little man, can you get some of the dry beans and some of the wetter ones and mix them together for me."  "Ahhhhhhh, fuck you people, this is a fucking wedding reception.  I'm not gonna mix your fucking this with your that."  Then there are the people that don't understand that you only get half the beans that are on the spoon cause they get stuck so don't give me shit.  "Oh, little boy, I don't want that many beans."   Ahhhhhhh FUCK YOU.  The positive side though is, I got a few small cups of special jello and $20.  Then there are always gonna be the people who after I said "Would you like some baked beans?"  They say "I don't want any beans."  Isn't a simple no enough.  Ahhh, I have to serve about 85 more people you don't need to tell me the whole fucking story.  Well, now that that's out there.  I must seem like a bitter person.  I'm really not, incompetence just really bugs me.  Not to mention, the number of people who had to tell me it's all going to the same place any way.  The first time it was pretty funny cause this old lady put barbecue sauce on her mashed potatoes because she thought it was gravy.  (I'm not gonna go into the fundemental differences of gravy and barbecue sauce.)  So, anyway, she put the barbecue sauce on her potatoes and I couldn't hold back the laughter.  Unfortunately, someone else told her that it wasn't gravy before she ate it.  Man, can you imagine what the look on her face woulda been like if she had eaten those potatoes thinkin they had gravy on them.  That's not the point though, the point is she started a chain reaction of "It's all going to the same place"  People around the world were saying it.
