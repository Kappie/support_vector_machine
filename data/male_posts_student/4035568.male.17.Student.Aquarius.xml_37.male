More freedom than we could have ever imagined! Well for those of us who have parents who need to know your every move and all your whereabouts like me it is! Plans for this year to come are very exciting I must say! We are obviously gonna be more daring than the norm, well I can't get much more daring than I already am!! And NO! I have never been sent to the office or dentention before!!! I'm careful and I have connections with the teacher world...I don't get into trouble I just cause it!! Yes there are the occasional sentence writings but, eh I lived! This is the start to a very exciting webpage from all the stories I will be getting in almost everyday when school starts!! So don't worry, this story may be the pits..but come on its Summer...not much takes place that is drop dead funny during it!! So..there!! Signing Off- Micaela
