I wish that the noise had covered up the smell though... Pee-ewww!          Anyway luckily for me the bus journey only lasted 10 minutes and I was allowed to breathe the freshair of Doncaster again, did I say fresh? I just meant air, no freshness about it.          Before work I decided to nip to Comet/Currys/PC World for a GBA game, Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario 3. I went to Comet first and looked at the selection, after not seeing the game I went to the counter and asked, he said he'd look. He typed something into the computer (I presume a Stock Check) and then proceeded to the games cabinet. At this point I thought I was lucky and that his stock check had found the game and he had proceeded to find it, however it seems it wasn't a stock check, or it was but after the failure he decided to look anyway, wasting a valuable 2 minutes of my time.          Next I moved onto PC World but they're smacktards and don't stock Nintendo products so I then moved on to Curry's. I went to the GBA shelve to notice a nice BIG mess of games! I started scurrying through and eventually found my game, behind some old games. Now correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't new products be displayed in front of older ones? I know that kids mess them up but most shops (at the end of the day) tidy their shelves up, putting things in the correct place, however I'm obviously wrong. So after the 5 minute search I made my way to the till where an old couple were having a laugh with the sales assistant, "Great!" I thought to myself... After a 5 minute wait I was finally served. I gave the assistant the empty case and she walked all the way to the otherside of the shop to get the game out of a room.          Anyway after leaving I couldnt go and get any dinner otherwise I'd be late for work so I proceded straight to work, hungry as a hippo.          It was3 o'clock and I was very happy as I only had an hour left and nothing had stressed me out. 40 minutes on the bell rung and I went to the desk, Ben told me two young lads had entered the shop and they were little shits so I had to keep my eye on them. Well turns out they weren't little shits, they were annoying little shits! Question after Question after Question! And then one of them touched me so I stupidly said "Don't touch me," and guess what, they kept touching me, so I began to walk off, they followed. I've never wanted to kick a 9 year old in the teeth more.          I could have cried when my shift finished...
