I've been reading it and is somewhat ... umh, well, not funny, but yes, a little bit interesting. I've been a lot busy this past weeks, and I like it. Anyway, I'm here to present you what I wrote a long time ago:    ....    September 21 - 2002 .    I'm alone at home at last. Finally, I have my Directv.  Being true with his feelings, Roger uses his journal to fill it with his deepest thoughts. But why in third person? Well, why not? Is a little change in his life.  Today was about his old hobby: the TV. He still thinks it wasn't cheap though. Naturally he's wasting precious time, there's a test next Monday and he's not prepared. He will have more free time tomorrow anyway. Today, is to be at home. This past days have been quiet, no excitement at all. As time passes and days fade is almost impossible to differentiate one day from other.  A relationship? non existent, but he does not feel alone. Thinks, knows he does not have someone to share everything with, he does not care for the moment though. School, TV and money is all there is in his head. His grades are good, almost excellent: 97.7 total. He's fourth or fifth in total grade at school level. He just hopes to keep it together.     ....    October 17 - 2002 .    Roger has been asking himself what's the point on having this journal if he does not write in it.  Well, at least it will be a register of how lame life is. A record that he at least keeps on walking and breathing, a record he's veins keep pumping blood without oxygen to his lungs.  Yesterday was the day of a glamorless event at school, in which the best students received some recognition: a diploma... It was weird moment, seeing people walking to the podium and accepting their recognition made him feel uneasy. Before him there were around 20 to 25 persons. There were all kind of reactions, the room was filled. There were the ones that were cheered, the ones that got an applause because two or three other persons knew them and there were the ones that no one cheered for them ( luckily those were never present ) all this made him feel a little bit worried. He thought no one would recognize him, no one will cheer for him. Filled with that, now classic, high school anxiety made him angry. Angry at how vulnerable he became, angry and tired that at this somewhat happy occasion he had to feel this uncomfortable. It was Linda's time to get her diploma... Do I need to say anything? ... Two more and it was his turn... His name was called. He froze, his heart pounding in his chest, but all this was just a moment, a second, because he was still standing from his chair when he heard that sound, cheers... classmates and friends... It was a perfect day.     ....    July 14 -2003     Time passes. Almost two years, and there have been two relationships, some social stress and a clear and marked slip in his grades... A clear sign he should not be in a relation when he's in school? Time will tell.  Months back, in the middle of October, He met someone he had not seen for a few years now: his friend Fernando. It was nice seeing the guy. He's traveled and lived in other countries. They exchange e-mails at the end.
