If I had to choose between sleeping with her and a certain someone, I've already made my decision, and I'll give you a hint; it isn't the ugly blonde "pop princess."  You know, I was watching this show on TLC today, I forget the name, but it's about cosmetic surgeons and whatnot. Two of the women in the show, in particular, stand out.    The firstwas a woman of around age 45, and she was damn hot for her age! She still had a pretty face, and deep set eyes with big upper eyelids. She didn't have the largest breats in the world, and theright one was gone due to cancer. So she goes in for breast implants, which is understandable because of the lost one, and she gets brought up to a small B size. Ok. She didn't get 38DD's, thats a good thing. But then she also gets some facial surgery. She gets the doctors to remove some of her upper eyelids so that her brow doesn't cover so much of her eye. I thought the way her eyes were fit her face PERFECTLY. She was already hot! She worked out, she ran every day! That's what I call sexy! But here the doctors are all like "Oh, she's disfigured. She needs the surgery if she ever wants to feel good about herself again..." crap blah bullcrap blah blah.  Then there's the second one, she was young, pretty, nice body, not anorexically skinny, etc. Her only quip is that she has somewhat of a large nose, with an arch at the top of it. Her brothers teased her and said that she looked like the parrot she kept in her room. What the fuck kind of shit is that? And her best friend got SOOO mad at her. Her best friend (as well as her boyfriend, but it was a suprise for the boyfriend)already thought that she was gorgeous, and thought that she shouldn't need to get surgery to feel good about herself. The girl getting the surgery kinda pisses me off. I, too, thought her nose fit her face just fine the way it was. She's already got a boyfriend, who's she trying to impress!?  This is how shallow the oceans of the world are.  People these days are so conerned about beauty and fashion and looking good and blah blah fucking blah.  Everyone is beautiful. Everyone is beautiful in their own special way. Somewhere out there, there is somebody that thinks you are the most beautiful person alive.  Everyone is beautiful, but society has this (rather skewed) concept of what beauty is. Beauty today is weighing one hundred pounds, while maintaining large breasts and a thin waist. Beauty is throwing up every day to keep skinny. Beauty is injecting poison into your faceso it doesn't get lines.  Our society's beauty is terrible. It makes people all over the world feel like shit. Why, because they don't look like the current fad?  Beauty is what you make of it.  To some, beauty is a big brain. To others, beauty is big biceps. Beauty is different from eye to eye among human beings. Why does our society try and make it into one thing, one identical thing, for everybody to see?  You are beautiful.
