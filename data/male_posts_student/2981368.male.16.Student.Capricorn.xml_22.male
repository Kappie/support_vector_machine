As for the rest of the day...it was so crap I'm not even gonna bother moaning about it. Much.  Apart from one thing...certain things were said by certain people at break...and I'm getting the feeling this has all gone way too far. And even I can take a hint like this. Lets just say...if what Jack says about how Nat feels is remotely true, she better do something quick. And I mean, quick.  Thanks for trying J, much appreciated.
