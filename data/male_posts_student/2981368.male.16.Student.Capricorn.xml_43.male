WEDNESDAY Again, didn't really do much. Apart from spent the whole of science mumbling "holy shit....argh craaaap...." repeatedly, while trying to find something ever so slightly scientific to put in a presentation (for science, duh) which had so far been pictures of Mr T and his van, Doc Brown and his flying Delorian, and Joe eating a banana.  THURSDAY Did the presentation. Decided at last minute to cut out the slide with the flying cars. Added the use of a ruler to point at stuff on the board with. Turned out really well in the end, most people found it at least kinda funny. Highlights: "And here we have Mr T saying "Its a helluva fast van, fool!" But really, he is the fool for wasting energy!" "As can be seen on this slide, only stupid people waste energy. Here we have such classics as Mr Bean, George Bush, Tony Blair, Baldrick, Homer Simpson, and Joe Firth." "...What the hell?!" Yeah. so in the end I just sat there pressing the 'next frame' button while Jack came up with lorryloads of made-up crap that went with what it said on the projector. Woohoo. And yeah, we kicked the stuffing out of Mat and Joe's one. SO EAT THAT Also finished IT c/wk, studied past exam papers, and hurt ma knee trying to bodycheck Ross in a game of football. Heh. Woops.
