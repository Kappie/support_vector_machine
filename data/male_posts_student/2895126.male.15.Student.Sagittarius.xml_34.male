I then got to school, did nothing until History, whereupon I believe I failed a test about Buddha.  On a more positive and interesting note, on the bus home I found some of Lauren's old letters (written in Runar). We were geeks. Now just I am. :)  Anyway, we also convinced J.T. to make a cult. He says it'll have uniforms. I'm looking forward to it. ;)  Today's a beautiful day! I think I'll practice and then go to work (not optional, unfortunately). I'll fill y'all in if something of note occurs.    It is folly to punish your neighbor by fire when you live next door.  (Publilius Syrus)
