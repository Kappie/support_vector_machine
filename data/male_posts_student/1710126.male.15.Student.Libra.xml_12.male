Very tired tho, no idea how to finish work by mondae. Can't be help lah, since i'm the nice and creative one =P  Maybe i will continue working till 0230 or something...all the work. Special thanks to my three CDs and stereo set and computer for accompanying me throughout the nite...have a nice rest after i sleep lolx.
