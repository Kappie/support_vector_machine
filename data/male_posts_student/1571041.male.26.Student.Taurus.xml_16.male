I get to doing what I do, that usually what ever the spur of the moment calls for, and then I get to heading back over to my cousin's house.  I find out that he's not around, and nobody knows his whereabouts.  Since I still had to work the next day, in the morning, I had to conclude my trip to the Yak Rez.  So, instead of doing the 'intelligent' thing of just heading home to catch up on some much needed sleep, I opt to try out adding more miles to my belt for the night by going to spokane.  I find out that that route is about 3 1/2 hours from Yak.  So, when I kept thinking I was going to be near spokane, I see that I am in fact not as close as I had thought.  I would normally be frustrated and start speeding around, but for some reason I had it in me to be patient and kept the regular pace of going the actual posted speed limit.  Oddly enough, I happened to wear my seatbelt as well.  The model driver?  Not really, I was listening to the new cd's I bought at volumes some would say is excessive.  Oh wells, I still made it just past midnight to my destination, or the beginning of it.  So, I get to Kospan (a.k.a. spokane) and manage to hook up w/ trey.  It was somewhat of a journey to get there though, but not too difficult.  Ended up @ a type of after hours party.  Mainly because there was a mix martial arts fight type of deal in idaho, not far from spokane, where The Lost Tribe performed.  I guess the song where I dropped 1/2 a verse was one of the songs chosen to use that night, but I was nowhere near there to be involved.  That would have been nice though.  Anyways, I get there, meet some new folks and reacquaint myself w/ others I already know.  It winds down quickly, and in order to force myself to keep on my toes I end up staying up all night.  A li'l discouraging facter is the fact I woke up @ 8 to be @ work that prior morning, so the drive home after 5 in the morning was pretty shaky from departure.  I'm heading out, and I'm doing fine until I get about 20 minutes away from home.  Nodding off starts to kick in and the eyelids start to lower consistantly.  Not so bad if I was somewhere stable instead of in a moving vehicle that I was attempting to drive.  Slaps to myself are given, and somehow, it works?  I got home and find out, I don't have to be in until noon...  Not a big deal though, because that day we staged on the rez preparing for the 4th of July fireworks being lit off to start some type of inferno anywhere withing close driving distance.  Oddly enough, it was uneventful during the day, so I got a li'l bit of sleep.  Nightfall hits, and we expect some activity then.  Well, just as the day was, the night ended up being a downer too.  Seemed so unexpected though, because there were mass people by the lake, and they were obviously intoxicated, but even w/ that factor added in, nothing?  AFter this escapade, we started to go to our regular hours, and regular jobs.  In a way that sucks, but it also allows for some form of relaxation to the mundane routines we got so used to prior to lightening strikes.
