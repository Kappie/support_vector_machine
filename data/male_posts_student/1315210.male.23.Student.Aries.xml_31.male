The days that you spend studying and mugging for the exams are the same as the upward ride of the rollercoaster. They are long, torturing and full of nerve-wrecking moments...........and then when you hit the top..............it's all downhill from there..............most of the time including your results............they keep going down down down until you hit rock-bottom...............just like your confidence in the exams.............
