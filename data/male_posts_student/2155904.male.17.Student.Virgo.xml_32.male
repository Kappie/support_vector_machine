How weird is that???  Well this day was really not that blogworthy but Tyke must talk everyday and share his ever-so-exciting life with the viewing public.  Eh, this is gay so whatever.  Today was a good Monday.  English was awesome cuz Tyke and Fejj Fish-head sang "Fuck Her Gently" in class.  They blasted Tenacious D and just started singing along.  It was one hell of a moment.  The whole class just started cracking up.  If you have heard the song you would know why.  And then after school Tyke made the 2-CD compilation of great love songs.  It is a keeper indeed.  Ask him for a copy and you may be so lucky to receive what you want.  But be careful what you wish for.  You never know what may be lurking on the other side of the door.  This blog will be closed with the joke of the day: How do you make a hormone?      YOU DON'T PAY HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG THAT IS SOOOO GOOOD!!!!
