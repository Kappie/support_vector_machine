Judges... Ooh...  As I start to talk, I see Your honors don't agree with me My standard of review's all wrong And your questions worse than I thought they'd be  And now I wish I could, turn back time Impossible as it may seem So I could read the facts, again, and the cases I'm Losing Ames From The Start  I'm Losing Ames From The Start I guess I'm just not that smart I'm Losing Ames From The Start I'm arguing the wrong part My suit is falling apart The judges just heard me fart   [..rhymes are hard...] I'm Losing Ames From The Start  I wrote my brief, but then The details have escaped my head Now they've got me pinned, to the wall Any answer that I give, I am dead  And now I wish I could, turn back time Impossible as it may seem So I could try again, with a clue, maybe I'm Losing Ames From The Start  I'm Losing Ames From The Start I guess I'm just not that smart I'm Losing Ames From The Start I'm arguing the wrong part My suit is falling apart The judges just heard me fart  I'm Losing Ames From The Start  I'm losing Ames, baby, baby The judges that I had were so strong Their questions could go on, forever Oh baby, baby Argument is wrong, 15 minutes seemed so long  Baby, ooh.. I'm losing Ames... Na, na, na... judges Na na na na na naaah
