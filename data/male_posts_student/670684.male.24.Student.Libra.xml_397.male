Set up your jukebox with the artists they let you (a much wider variety than I expected, as many of them that I can never find on Kazaa are here, causing my great rally for Kazaa to fall bunk), and play it out.  79 cents to download to the computer, and you don't get the damn static that often comes with illegal downloads now.    And in trying to find songs that I love but don't know the words to, I came across Bon Jovi (not because I didn't know the song, but because there was a song called WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BON JOVI that had similar lyrics to the song I was looking for), and threw THIS AIN'T A LOVE SONG on my download list.  It's a guilty pleasure song, one of the oldest...a song I'd throw into the stereo on Thursday afternoons in Cline D3 when Will Kordsmeier was doing his library shift, throw it up to loud, shut the blinds enough to allow light to sneak rather than flood, and listen, thinking about how great life will be.  And here it is again.  And somehow, the future tense is now present tense.    A sexy Lauren Jackson look-alike is sitting at the table just inches away from me, separated by a thick slab of glass (no comptuer use outside, so I'm at the counter writing pages, or I was writing pages before grabass won out, as it tends to do).  She comes here all the time; almost every time I am here, she is.  And yes, I am a pussy, that's obvious by the year+ of ridiculous posts here regarding loathing.  But the interesting thing here is that not one time have I been here alone when she's been here alone...right now she sits with a poor man's Christina Ricci, a taller version with a less attractive face but a beautiful beauty mark on the right shoulder (They both wear tight white cotton tank tops, the kind that frown on bras for the support inherent within, and allow for greater skin prowess).  And probably 80% of the time that I'm here with someone, she's here alone.  Yesterday I spent three hours at the Little City, working with students on short scripts and final outlines, and the entire time she sat maybe 15 feet away, alone, reading WONDER BOYS, a movie I didn't enjoy but a book I liked (it was what it was).    She kind of reminds me of Sarah Lagersen...every time a person shows up that she knows, immediately she springs into life, with vim and vigor and hugs and talk and gossip.  I often wondered if that was a defense mechanism for feeling important...sometimes I use it as one.  Never figured it out with Sarah.  Sarah and I knew one another for two and a half years before we first spoke, and we were forced into conversation because of Brian Thomas, who was somewhat dating Sarah.  And we became great friends after that, inciting me to drive through Shreveport on my way back to Dallas from Naples, on what was undoubtabdly the greatest. road trip. Ever.    My mom needs a new car.  Needed one for a while.  There was a 90 Volvo for sale a few doors down from me a week ago...might check it out on the way home.  Might check it out, test drive it, get it inspected, and if it's in good shape, drive it to Naples after my thesis is due.  I've been needing a good road trip for a while.  Four days would do the trick.    But you need people to make road trips as good as they can be.  My road trip was made by visits with Danny Ruiz, Sarah Lagersen, Cristal Willcox, and the impoverished of Tallahassee.  Got a haircut there as well whilst playing Florida grabass.    And now I feel like I owe the woman who is the Dean of Students at Centenary an email.  Lori Bradshaw.  yes!  how did I forget that name?  I wanted to say Karen McGowan (is that Mac rather than Mc), but knew she was the Rogers teacher with tons of kids who took over Debate and looks like every woman who cuts my hair in Austin (at least the ones that are actually women and not the ones who just dress the part).  Nostalgic.
