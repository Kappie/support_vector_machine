Anyway I just got back from that  it was quite satisfactory... despite the fact that I was miles away from the stage(damn u wei loong for being late =p). That  most of kuching's female population turned out. A short dialogue of four guys surrounded by hot chicks :   russ: yo, 12 o'clock...  wei loong: yeah. okler... not bad. the one behind u better.   tee hiong: where? *blur*   ervin: yeaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh~~!!!! JOOOOOLLIIINNNNN~~!!!  russ: fuh... check out the one behind u man. daaaaamn...  WL: holy !@#!@# shit. gimme that camera. *fumbles*  TH: where?? I can't see... where????  ervin: *drooling watching jolin dance around on stage*  russ: I can't seem to get it outta my pocket... !#!@#  WL: damnit!! hurry up!! she's... damn. u missed it. !@#!@ n00b.  TH: wtf... I can't see a damn thing...  ervin: omg... jolin's dancing is so... so... so... *drools somemore*  russ *siiiiiiiighhhh*  That's about how it went 'round the middle of the show. After that paid more attention to Jolin  her background dancers 'cos the songs were starting to pick up and got more jumpy. Go get her CD now. Worth it... for some songs. Hahahaha. Run dun walk to Kenyalang now. LolZ. Short note: Jolin's dancing rocks. Go buy her VCD too. ~^^~  On a side note, I wanna ferret. My friend in KL has one and its the coolest looking pet ever. Damn. Unique... wonder if you can get one ova here? Any ideas? LolZ.   The weekend is here ! Yay ! Sleeping at 2 a.m never felt so good.   ~Fin.
