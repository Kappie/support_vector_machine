It's really not that bad, just a little pink around the eyes mostly.  Google tells me lotion with aloe should help the healing.  After playing, I put some names and facts together and realized that I think one of the people I was playing with writes a weblog I read.  I'm sure I'll figure that out for sure sometime soon (especially if he reads mine too, which I think he might).  Here's a song parody.  "Firm, Firm, Firm" (to the tune of "Turn, Turn, Turn" by The Byrds)  In the fall - firm, firm, firm This is the season - firm, firm, firm There's a firm for every student who is breathing  A firm for the boy, on law review A firm for the girl, who likes to sniff glue A firm for the wand'rer who hasn't a clue A firm for the one, with a grade-point of 2  In the fall - firm, firm, firm This is the season - firm, firm, firm There's a firm for every student who knows Lexis  A firm with good food, a firm on the beach This firm's a safety but this one's a reach One firm that soon will say it's bankrupt But one firm who'll hire all their lawyers   In the fall - firm, firm, firm This is the season - firm, firm, firm There's a firm for every student with no jail time  One profits from war, one profits from peace One from cigarettes, and one from disease One firm pays less than the others That firm does not get any students  In the fall - firm, firm, firm This is the season - firm, firm, firm There's a firm for every student who's done sleeping  A firm for you, a firm for me A firm that wil fly you to meet them for free A firm who will woo you, a firm who will plead A firm that will promise you you will succeed A firm that will work you until your eyes bleed
