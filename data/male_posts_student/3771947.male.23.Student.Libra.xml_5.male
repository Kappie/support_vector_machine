The sun being in its fall within your sign means that most of your actions are dictated by others but in order to be balanced you must learn to offset your obliging nature with an iron clad will that you will have to work hard at acquiring so that you will learn to make hard and fast decisions and not be swayed from them when push comes to shove.   Your sign is the only one where your symbol is an object and not a human being or an animal. This shows that you may be living your life as an immaculate concept rather than as a living, breathing, fallible, creature. You must allow yourself to make mistakes (and take full responsibility for them) just like the rest of the world; in this way, balancing your life, you will find your greatest happiness. After you have established that you have a good set of values you can rely on your natural charm to keep your romantic relationships on an even keel.  Your sense of harmony attracts many relationships, personal one on one or in business, either way you must depend on your inner sense to balance these and create harmony in your life and surroundings. Libra is the sign of the peacemaker and a cardinal sign which means that you are supposed to be an initiator of social activities, not simply a response to them. Being the peacemaker you can solve conflicts and disagreements using your art of dealing with others rather than ignoring the problems that have shown themselves to you.   You must guard against letting the negative steal into your life which will definitely make you very unhappy. You could become superficial and lazy, self-indulgent and greedy, demanding and underhanded, or an insincere yes person. You have the tendency to become vain and class conscious and if you are not diligent in rooting these tendencies out early in life you could become a complaining, easily upset person who thinks he or she knows it all thus driving away the very people who are important to your happiness. You have the potential to be a wonderful, likable, and kind human being. Endeavor to live up to it.
