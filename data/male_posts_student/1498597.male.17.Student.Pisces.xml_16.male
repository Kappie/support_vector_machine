It was really fun,  JR  will have to fill you in on the other information. My heartfelt condolensces to  ELYSE . I heard about the crap that happened to you in 5th period. That is just crap, he should not have done that to you.... Hence,   FEEL BETTER, OK?!?!?!?!?!   Wow, it is indeed a little hot right now. My mom gave in and turned on the air coniditioning for once. Yay! :) Anyway, I will blog a little more when there is more to talk about.  Alright then. See ya later! This is   Nick  signing off!
