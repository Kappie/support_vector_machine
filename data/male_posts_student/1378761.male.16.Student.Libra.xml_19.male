How cool is that?!! Come on! How often do you call the FBI? I felt pretty good. I hope tommarow the FBI will be calling me!! Yeah. OK so if you don't already know, I am totally obessed with the FBI, Law Enforcment and Public Safety in general. If you listen to my voicemail, you would notice I love COPS. I LOVE COPS!!  I pretty much know all the codes for our local police department. I have a scanner on my desk in my office with an attenna on the roof, and a scanner in the car. I love to listen to police/fire. Have a story to go with this.  Ok so one night me and the gang (Gang refering to: Myself, Josh, Tim, and me thinking our guest Billy) were driving around. We started to follow the police which was easly for me because I have a scanner in my car. Well I guess we followed this one a little to close. So they got done pulling someone over at the church. There was like 3 cruisers there. I pulled out of a alley right after him. So he stopped at a stop sign. He then radioed in my license plate numbers back. He went straigh and I took a quick turn right.  He probely thought I would turn on the next road (a major road) but I didnt. I went straight and I forgot it was a dead in. So i quicky tured in the turn and there he was. He was turning around and I turned and spend and got out. He had to wait becase there was a car comming. So that was a close encounter. I also got pulled over another time for having no lights on, but he did'nt say anything.   So I really do have a thing up with Law Enforement. What can I say? Thats about it. Oh yeah. Let me just add that I really hate gym class. It is gay. Also I have this obsession with a girl that skips school a lot. She'll probebly lead me to trouble LOL.  Later, __ERIC__
