According to the official  urlLink LinksBoks site  it has the following features:   - Easy user control via pull-down menu mode, in 25 languages. - HTML 4.0 support (without CSS) - HTTP 1.1 support - Tables and frames in both graphics and text mode - Builtin image display for GIF, JPEG, PNG, XBM, TIFF in graphics mode - Anti-advertisement animation filter in animated GIFs? - Javascript support with full user control over script run - Bookmarks - Background file downloads - Much more...     LinksBoks seems like a decent browser for you couch surfers.  I prefer  urlLink Mozilla/Firefox  within  urlLink Xbox Linux , but if you don't want to install Linux, this makes a great stand alone app that is launchable from within any dashboard.
