Some writers have said yes, that pure love, unquestioning  unfailing, depends for its sustenance on our finding our loved one imperfectly accessible to us, and is therefore impossible in marriage, where the mate is already possessed. Like many philosophical arguments, the issue is to a large extent psychological. When the philosopher finishes defining love(, undoubtedly, to do so, he must accord to the term its spectrum of diverse meanings), we are left with the fact that some people seem to love their mates forever, unquestioningly,  that others find it impossible to love or respect those who become accessible.   The illness has no name, though it is widely recognized. Its victims are doomed to yearn for the woman who rejected them -- as they yearn for the item they couldn't afford, while they underestimate the value of what they can afford. No matter how much they acquire, they feel unrewarded. Their experience is that whatever they most esteem  try hardest to attain declines in value from the moment they secure it.   Some of these people describe themselves as "loving the chase"; however, this is merely a retrospect attempt to account for their discovery. As soon as such a person becomes assured that he is wanted  needed, the interaction shifts from courtship by him to courtshipof him by the other person. The morethe other person assures him of devotion, the faster he falls out of love.   Victims of the illnessdo not always propound the philosophy described earlier. Likenearly all the rest of us, they assert that we ought toesteem people things for their intrinsic value  not their market value. Intrinsic value does not increase with scarcity  decrease when the object is readily available. Market value reflects scarcity;  thus theproblem I'm talking about is that of beingunable to love and appreciatepeople  thingsfor their intrinsic value.   The phenomenon is observable ineveryday contacts, where our feelings are not as intense as in love relationships. If the person afflicted with the attitude hasknown us for years watched us learning our profession, or making thetransition from childhood to adulthood, he may forever refuse to acknowledge that we have become capable. As an employer, he finds it hard to acknowledge when his underlings have, through experience, qualified themselves to handle better jobs in his organization. In some fields, it is common practice for workers to shift from one organization to another every few years, since employersrefuse to give appropriate resposibilities salaries to people who have developed their skills within the organization. The philosophy seems to be: If you're familiar especially if you've needed me, then I cannot respect your skills.   Parents who suffer from this disease may refuse to concede their children's maturity, simply becausethey remember the days when the kids were helpless  dependent on them. It's a sadtruthabout many parents that their children would do better performing for someone elses parents.   How far does the prejudice against the familiar influence you? Do you regularly treat dinner guests better than the people who live with you? Are you regularly late for appointments made with intimates,  seldom late for those made with strangers? Do you fawn infront of professional men  excuse them after they've kept you waiting for hours, , in contrast, complain when someone you know keeps you waiting even a few minutes? If so, like millions, you are assuming, without considering the matter, that the time of people you don't know is more important than that of people you do, and your discriminatory treatment is renewing that assumption.   The belief that others will esteem us in proportion to our inaccessibility motivates a variety of tactics--all bad, since either they fail immediately, or they succeed but have harmful repercussions. Instilling jealousy in people is one such tactics. What the otherperson does while jealous may, as you expect, intensify his desire for you.However, if hismotivation for courting you isn't affection but fear of losing you, when you put aside your tactic, it's predictable that his attentions will come to a halt. Because fear was at the heart of his trying to win you back, you can expect resentment once you have gone back. Since making people jealous is, in the end, little more than instilling fear in them, we may expect the advantages of the tactic to be short-lived.In addition, whenever we conciously use a tactic in a relationship, we renew our belief that the tactic is needed to keep the relationship alive;  thus the use of tactics, whatever they are, robs us of intimacey with people...
