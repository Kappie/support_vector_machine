      Hmm. My top ten movie list of all time. Hard to say, really. I usually just leave it at three, but even those have been fluctuating lately. So, let me try and top Nick and all of his 90s movies with a bit of variety. Of course, maybe I'm lying to appear more in the so-called know. Anyway, here it is from 1 to 10, Glenn's top 10 movies of all time.  1. 2001: A Space Oddysey  That's cheating for Nick to make a "guess" that this would be on the list, since he knows for a fact it's my goddamned favorite movie. Some people may think it's boring (Jane), but I think it's just a complete exercise in film craft. Hypnotic, and for me it's impossible to turn away from. And I don't even know if at this point in time any films have really beat it in the special effects department.  2. The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly  Fucking brilliant. This movie destroys the entire concept of westerns. Eli Wallach is my favorite as the Ugly. It's obvious he had the most fun shooting of all of the main characters. Movies don't get much prettier than this.  3. Dawn of the Dead  I love the color in this movie. It just all seems so surreal. None of it is really in shadows, every bit of horror and satire is right up front. True, some of the social commentary is a bit blaring, but I never, ever get bored watching this movie. Kids these days would probably complain because there are a lot of slow parts, and not enough nu metal, but those are the best parts. Like when you don't see zombies for 20 minutes of the movie and you kind of forget what kind of terrible situation they're in. Fantastic.  4. Lawrence of Arabia  Ok, so here's where my list starts to get a bit fuddled. I know for a fact the first three movies are my favorite three movies, but these next seven may be awesome movies which hover around my top twenty of all time. It's so hard to pick, I think. Nevertheless, Lawrence of Arabia is an awesome movie. Once I almost had an opportunity to see this in the theater, but I had to do some other boring shit. Man, I really hope I get the chance to redeem myself for that one. You might say, how could one make the desert look beautiful? Well, watch this movie and find out.  5. Singin' in the Rain  Uh oh. I may have just thrown this one in for variety. This is, however, one of the funniest fucking movies you will ever see in your life. I don't give a good god damn how many times my roommate claims Fred Astaire is better at dancing, Gene Kelley is a better actor, director, and knows how to make a dance scene work. I've always said I'd trade my heterosexuality to be able to dance like this cat. I'll stick to that still, but maybe only because deep down inside I know there's no way I could ever dance like him. Oh well.  6. Jackie Brown  See? See? I have a semi-recent movie up here too. Few other movies make me know characters as well as this movie here. Everything just comes to life for me, and I find the older I get the more solidified this is as Tarantino's best flick. Now, maybe I waver on this whenever the full Kill Bill comes out, but for now this stands.   7. Apocalypse Now  Hm. This is probably higher up than seven on my list, I just didn't think about it first. Like I said, these all shake around. I got the opportunity to see this in the movie theater when it was rereleased, and even though I thought every additional scene sucked scientific balls, this was the most incredible looking movie I have ever seen in my life. The bridge scene in the theater was worth the price of admission alone.  8. Duck Soup  There have never been a more coherent and talented group of comedians as the Marx brothers, and this movie is solid proof. I can watch this movie three times in a row and it never gets less funny. Taxes? I have an uncle who lives in taxes. No, taxes as in dollars. Yeah, that's where he lives. Dollars, taxes.  9. Raging Bull  I couldn't not have Scorsese up here. Then again, I only have one space left, and I have no Spielberg, no Hitchcock, no Lee, no Scott... aaaagh! But this is easily Scorsese's best picture. Less flash than Taxi Driver, but way more know-how. De Niro is flawless in this movie as well. Very depressing. He should have won best director, but instead he was doomed to edit crap for the oscars for all eternity.  10. Revenge of the Nerds  I had to have one "what the fuck" entry up here. But seriously, there is no better movie that exemplifies all of the eighties "geeks fight back" extravaganzas. I wonder, though, if the main girl was supposed to look good naked, because to me she looks more like a fucking skeleton. Eat something, girl.  Oh, man. I missed a bunch. Let me just throw a few other masterpieces out, just to round out my top twenty.  11. Raiders of the Lost Ark 12. Vertigo 13. Blade Runner 14. Once Upon A Time in the West 15. Malcolm X 16. The Godfather 17. Touch of Evil 18. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan 19. Dr. Strangelove 20. American Grafitti  Even that isn't enough. So many movies, so little time. On the lighter side of things, I read a poem at a local poetry night last night that one of my friends hosts. It's held in a gay bar, which was weird at first because whenever I got there this creepy old guy started making eyes at me. Now, I'm not gay, but if I was gay I think I'd be out of that guys league. I mean, come on. I could do much better than that wrinkled old fool. Also, the poem I read has the word "gaytarded" in it (my own concoction), which I don't think went over too well with the crowd. Oh well. Exposure is exposure.
