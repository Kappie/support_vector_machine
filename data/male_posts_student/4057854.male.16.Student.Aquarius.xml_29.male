It has also done some wizardry in the back office and changed the name of Windows XP 64-bit for Extended 64-bit Systems to Windows XP Pro X64 edition - certainly less of a mouthful.  The beta will take you fair time to download, even if you've got broadband, and includes support for Bluetooth and extended language support.   urlLink Source
