Whatever happened yesterday? Errr....nothing much in terns of classes. Okay okay lor.   Right. We went to the rehearsal for the MDIS concert at Swissotel the Stamford. It was a meowing bus ride there, as BoonChai and I talked and talked. Weee!   Wow! That hotel is very gao gui! Very posh and elegant. Duhz. That's a 5-stars (or issit 6-stars) hotel! Of course it is posh and elegant! haHa. We went to this room and met the Hai Sing cats and ducks and whatnot. O.O!!!  Okay. We got into position. Ayioh. Me and John are the shortest leh. Kept getting teased one. HaHa! Oh alright. I got into the front row first, sandwiched between two Hai Sing tenors. Both Sec 1s though. The one on my right is pretty inconsistent in his pitching, and I am ashamed to say that he affected me a little and I have strain to hear John's voice at the back. The left cat didn't pose a problem at all, as he was too soft to be heard. Ah. He should really project his voice, but oh well. As long as he doesn't affect me. Now I sound mean. :P  Righto. I got transferred to the second row next! YaY! I was promoted! Okay. There's one major distraction. The guy next to me on my left. He's a bass, probably a Sec 3 (Sec 4s would have left already) and he sings damn well! He's tall too. Ayioh! His voice is sooo deep, and so distracting. Yes! The bass sound terribly nice in One Songthough. Yes. It was very distracting! Loud and accurate pitching, I found it terribly hard to follow John. Yes!  We ended at 5something. Miss Ong was apparently not pleased with our choir. It's excusable we don't know the MDIS song, for we only practised it on Monday. However, for the other two songs, she said we have no excuse not to know our work. She promised late stay-backs tomorrow if our performance is unstatisfactory. Heh.  Okay. Me, CQ and Gloria went home. Janna caught up to us and joined us on the way back home. I was apparently an interesting entertainment on the train. CQ and Gloria said the way I sleep is very interesting. I would lean my head...and lean until it was dangerously close to resting on CQ's shoulder. Then I would snap back and sit straight, and continued sleeping. HaHA! I did that in all directions too (except to the back). I know I am doing it, but I didn't know it was  that  interesting to watch. Heh Heh.   Right. YAY! Charmed's coming back on August 11!! WEEEE! Charmed! Charmed! Charmed!!! Even Piper, Phoebe and Paige are meowing and mooing at the cats and ducks and whatnot! Weee!!   Thursday     Righto. Today we have SPA. School-Based Practical Assessment. On Chemistry on titration. Sigh. It was testing of Skill C and D, which means calculations and evaluation. I think I did well on the calculations. I think. I can safely get a Level 6. For Skill D, I think I did fairly well and met expectations. A safe bet on getting Level 5 ba.   Mrs Jasima, however, was not pleased with our class. I think our class has garnered bad reputation from the Chemistry teachers. Mrs Tay and Mrs Jasima are both saying they were not pleased with S22 at all. Sigh. We felt so yue wang. I didn't think that I was playing a fool and not paying attention to Mrs Jasima. I can safely say that I met her expectations ma. I don't think S22 is what the teachers think lor. It's just some black sheeps here and there ma. I think our class, as a whole, is quite well-behaved and easily manageable. Of course, the only teacher we got along well with is Ah Tham, and I am glad of that. Come on, if we don't even get along with our form teacher, then we are pretty dead meat. Yeah! So hooray for Mr Tham!! WEE!!  Okay. We can skip to choir le. Nothing much happened. Okay. Choir! O.O Astro sat between me and CQ this time. I like sitting besides Astro. He's fun and sillyto sit besides with. HAHAHA! Yeah. He sings well too. Good good. :) And sigh. I got demoted back to the front row. Along with Astro wor! HaHa! Great! :D And yes, we sang well enough. YaY!   Okay okay. Now I am back. HaHa. I gotta go now. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
