Today was my first day of classes, and my bastard teachers all decided to lecture for the full time. I don't know about your side of the drink, but traditionally here the first day of class is reserved for going over the syllabus, looking and feeling really bored, acting cool so that you get in with the cool kids on the first day (just like me, Adam, Lars, and Steffen in Spanish class), scoping the class for pretty faces, then getting the hell out of class at least 1/2 hour early. Maybe we've outgrown that phase, though. Well, maybe just the getting out of class early part. I've got one class with an annoying "friend" who I went to high school with. I've known him since we were 3, so I have to pretend to like him, but he really just annoys the shit out of me. We've had classes together before, and they've been brutal. Gonna be a long semester of me pretending to find his jokes amusing. That's the worst part...he's not funny.   I'm about to go make myself some hot dogs now, of the same quality Oscar Meyer variety that I brought to the cena internacional at Walker's. But no on wanted them at the cena...shame, shame. I'm making these ones Chicago-style. Yes, we have our own hot dog style, just like our own pizza style, and our own blues style. Basically, we have to put our name on everything we create lest New York or LA steal it and claim it as their own. Beware of coastal peoples (e.g. Ulli)...they're shade-errific. Take care.
