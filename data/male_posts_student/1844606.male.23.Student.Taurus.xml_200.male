I'm digging the new template, not only the rustic windswept lighthouse (which reminds me of Lake Michigan back home, but the text of the font is like that you would find in a good book.  My anger and disbelief at the thesis fiasco has been subdued when I found out 6 others faced the same unfortunate fate as I and that in conjunction with my impassioned letter (and tons of people failing) the system as I know it is dead.  Small comfort for having so much energy wasted, but there's hope that people in the future will not suffer the same ways I have.  Moreover, my relationship with one sdavenpo is totally copacetic and I found out I was very impressive in an interview with his wife.  Both are very good pieces of news.  Unfortunately, I may fall on my grammatical face when I get the proofreading test the publishing house sends out, but I'll deal with that later.  For today, I am content in knowing that all that I could have done is done.  Even losing three straight games in euchre didn't dampen spirits-though after playing approx 30 games in the past week, my various partners and I have failed to win a game, and have only taken about 8 tricks.  Hella weak.  I would like to post pictures here, but it involves free samples of some random product I don't trust.  So for all of you who don't know me, just keep on imagining what I look like.    PS All you hipsters left out in the cold without Wilco tix to the Vic, I got a pair.  Looks like the trip back to chambana paid off.  God bless T1 lines!
