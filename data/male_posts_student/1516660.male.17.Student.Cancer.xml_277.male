They all come so late some more...  HaHa! During the attendance taking, the teacher always leave me and MingYao out lor!! For two staight days, she marked us absense. Luckily we managed to correct her in the end. Haiyo. Actually hor, we can leave right away, since ya know, she marked us absent and all. Might as well be really absent. HaHa.   In the assembly, an announcement was made that all former choir and Chinese Ochestra members were to meet. I was like...ooh. It looks like they wanted the choir members into the PJ Choir. There's this rule or some sort, about it being obligatory to go back to your old CCA. Of course, there's this audition, which I can fail easily (my pitching sucks. I asked the teacher about audition failing, she said "I don't thinka ynone would fail the audition, given you all have been in choir for 4 years.". There are some special cases lor, like those who can't pitch!! O.o!). PY was so angry at this system, because she hates choir. Never seen her this angry before. O.o!  After the thingy, I went over to the CO group (wait for my friend Ming Yao). HAHa. The teacher mistook me as a CO member. I don't wanna sign the list ma, so I said "Don't gimme". The teacher said "You can run but you can't hide". Hello!! I am only an accompaniment. Meow meow meow!   After the fiacso, we went for games. Woah. This time not bad ar... Even though we only won once. HaHa. I was running along the track to the other end when my group suddenly shouted "Go Kelvin Go!" Woah! That's such a huge morale booster. I ran much faster. HaHa! This is the first time I felt so happy too. HeHe.   After games, we went for breaks. Then, we went up the hall to complete the mass dance. Ayioh...not like i wanna say leh. My dance partners for today and yesterday not fun one....so shy....and clumsy. My luck! Meow!  Then, we went down for break again. I ate chicken rice. We went up to the hall, and sat down to discuss our mascot. Yeah, this and that. We were given a lunch break, but since we alreadt ate, we remained in the hall for games. HaHa. All require some embrassing forfeit ones. HaHa! Heng ar...I never forfeitted. HaHa.  The rest of the time until school ends was spent learning cheers and saying them. Moo meow! I had to stay back for quite a while ro wait for CQ and Hann, whose group are dicussing/doing the costume for mascot. Yeah...wait till 5+ something, then we set off lor.  I dropped at Woodlands, and went to Metro to find Manda and Wendy. I caught Amanda just before leaving work (she was hanging back clothes). both of us went up to the linen (it was pronounced as li-nen. I always pronounce it as lie-nen.) department to look for Wendy, who is working in the afternoon shift.  We chatted for quite a bit, then me and Amanda went home. Moo meow!  Sigh... you say how. After visiting Metro, I have such a powerful urge to go work there. Sigh.... see la.... I dunnoe what decision to make you know. I don't think I am informing the principal le la. I just don't turn up for lessons lor.  Moo meow!  Sigh! I don't know I don't know I DON'T KNOW!! SIGH!!!!!  I gotta go le... See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
