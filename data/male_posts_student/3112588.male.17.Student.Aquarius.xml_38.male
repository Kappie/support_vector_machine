WOW she's making hecka cash i guess, but ill be praying for ya jess! came home, and took a nap for like 2 hours...i was up REALLY late last night just talking with stephanie lassalle. now, stephanie never really liked me until like a few months ago haha (we met in the 7th grade, when we ran against eachother for president)...but yeah, so i just talked to her. she's really struggling right now with some family issues--her parents aren't saved, and they were REALLY mean when she brought her friends over the other day. see, the thing is, she has some friends from the "Rock" (which i have to go back in 2 weeks, b/c told chris burke i would gag), and she doesn't know if they're gonna like be there for her FOR SURE in the long run...so she feels that she just had another point against her when her dad was really rude to her and her friends. pray that she can trust God as her friend, as her Father, and as a Comfort to her when she REALLY needs it. she seems to be doing much better, after the "Rock" had their little houseboat trip which im sure most of you heard about (laura, sara, etc etc)...but yeah, just pray for her, kk? thanx guys..so yeah, i took a nap, woke up and went for a swim! the pool was very warm, and felt so nice...just swam for like 30 minutes, then i got out to have a little dinner before church. we were going to wait for my dad to get home to go to church, but he wasnt there in time, so we just left without him. laura and i searched for like 5 minutes to try and find a place to sit at the breaking of bread LoL! oh yeah, and i saw my SARAH DYER today!! sarah is like my older sister, and im sure you ALL know that i've always wanted one....so yeah, but she is gonna be a teacher at a so-cal christian school next year! she has NO credentials for the things they're having her teach, but i told her to look at it as an adventure!! haah! oh yeah--almost forgot me, alex, ariel, my mom, mrs dyer, and sarah dyer were all talking in the parking lot after church today for like 45 minutes, no lie!! LoL it was great..and of course alex, who feels she always has to flatter me: "noah cowart! you're wasting away to nothing!!" (LoL!!!!) she also said: "you're getting SOOOO skinny! almost tooooo skinny, its scaring me!" i was like OHHHH PLS! LoL! but yeah everyone who was invited--shopping trip to Bay Street is happening on Friday, July 9th! i cant wait everyone...i gotta get a few new outfits for the San Diego trip in August! cant wait MWAHAHAH! sooooo, didnt do much tonight, except go to safeway (laura's 2nd home), and the video store...but my mom got some pretty "gay" movies (yes, as some ppl say--gay) so i just typed away for the night, and tried to find out my username for this blog thingie, b/c i forgot it and yeah....so, im home all day tomorrow i think, unless some magical nice person who loves me a lot calls me up and says: hey, lets just jet somewhere..that would be nice, wouldnt it?
