I spent yesterday, doing some much needed editing to my next short story "The Dreamer".  It's going pretty well, and I guess I've discovered something about writting (at least for me) a good story is like a baby, it's generally not all planned for, and grows quickly on it's own.  It has it's own life, it's own mind and it's own soul.  The writters job is to jot down what the story has to say.  A bit of philosophy for y'all there.  But seriously.  The story has hit me with writters block, I don't know whether to wrap up the plot, and just end the story, or if to continue on.  Logically, I could continue it into a second day, but I'm not sure where I want to climax of the story to be, and I do believe I've already hit a good one.  Also, continuing would change the entire mood of the story, from something of personal discovery, and self-control, to something far more cosmic like Responsibility, or some other crazy word they peddle to us in English class.   Not like you, dear reader (which is likely just two people), even care much about this.   So I'll move on.  Michael, Thomas and Idris came over today.  We did our stupid, we're so cool, even without watching TV guyish type of things.  Magically this occupied over five hours, que bueno, no? Then I played Dungeon Keeper until the old fashion graphics with their glaring colors made my eyes start to water.  So I just said "F'it" and logged out, and now I'm about to burn new CD, and probubly play that while I outline.  But who knows, I'm tired still from outlining the Civil War Chapter Yesterday (and I still need to mark down all the major battles).  All this while Cotter flee off to Bongoland to have little kids run up to him and say "Mzee"! and "Mzungu"! and numerous other happy things in Swahili.  I can imagine Cotter with a phrase book now looking for a Teksi "Teksi! Teksi! Hundi za Posta?" But with a distinctive Cotter tone.
