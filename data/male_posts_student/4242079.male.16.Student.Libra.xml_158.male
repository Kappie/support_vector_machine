Bring Out Your Dead  Strung Out      one brief recollection of all the people in my life that have come and gone one brief fleeting moment of people I've loved and the people that i have wronged  long lost are the loved ones gone but this bird cannot seem to  mend it's broken wing so the lust for life dissipates and a new greed rises for the needful things  don't wanna think about it  i indulge myself distraction means less pain bury my emotion to protect myself 'til i can't feel a fuckin' thing i've dared to dream and i've tried to live but I'll play it safe again I'm just a slave to my vices now... BRING OUT YOUR DEAD  Voices wither and crack then die the ringin' in my ear will sing me soft asleep dead silence now is all I hear inspration following me don't wanna think about it  i indulge myself distraction means less pain  bury my emotion to protect myself  'till i can't feel a fuckin' thing  I've dared to dream and i've tried to live But I've played it safe again  Just another slave to my vices now...  my addiction, my illness my only trusted friend my addiction, my illness my only childhood friend you twisted warm embrace engulfing all i tried to be my body's breaking under arms that will not SET ME FREE my addiction my illness my only childhood friend  my addiction my illness my only trusted friend.......  Locked in this cage that I've built myself constructed out of twisted cold reminders of a life once lost but i've found my way again here among the wreckage and the vampires but i'll play it safe again i'm just a slave to my vices now...  my addiction, my illness my only childhood friend my addiction my only life      what a fucking great song.
