So before I could get in a writing mood, I went back to Mosjoen on Tuesday. And it was good, because I was bored half to death here in Korgen. Back in Mosjoen, I went to play tennis for the first time in my life and it was killer! I'm going to try to play that on a regular basis now. I also went to see Spider-Man2. It was good... Not great or anything, but if you look at the movie as a whole then it was much better than the first movie. The only bummer about the trip was that last night I got a really bad tummyache. I didn't even get one wink of sleep! So I watched The Last Samurai to keep me occupied. It was very good! A tad too long, but still very good. Right now I still have a tummyache (as well as a minor headache), so you'll have to excuse me if my writing is crap. I seem to be making a lot of excuses lately... Heh.    Meh... I need to take something for my tummy.     I'll write more when I'm better!    Later!    Song Of The Day:  Bloc Party - Banquet
