China's best-known Olympian, NBA all-star Yao Ming, is due to trot the final leg of a 55-km (34-mile) course from Tiananmen Square to the Summer Palace.  He will be the last of 148 athletes to bear the fabled torch for the first time in China, including Olympic table tennis champion Deng Yaping and gymnast Sang Lan, the national pommel horse champion paralysed at a 1998 meet in the United States, Xinhua news agency said.  The torch, which arrived on Tuesday aboard a Greek chartered jumbo jet called Zeus, began its journey in Tiananmen Square and will zigzag past construction zones of Games venues and other projects under way for 2008.  The flame, lit from the sun's rays in Olympia on March 25, will travel to 33 cities in 34 days and for the first time reach all five continents represented by the Olympic rings.  The flame will return to Greece on July 9 for a final homecoming tour before entering the Olympic stadium to light the cauldron on August 13.  copyright to reuters.co.uk  Any comments apprciated.
