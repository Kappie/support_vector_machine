Well for the past few days I haven't been able to sleep at all. About three hours every night, I really don't like it, its really wearing on me. I guess its because I've been thinking so much lately. We went out to the rec-center the other night. The rest of my family went and swam, I stayed out and I found some people playing volley-ball. So after they invited all the people that came after me they finally invited me. It was fun to not have to worry about anything for a while, and hang out with people my age, and just have fun... It was cool. We're going later tonight. There's also an awesome skate park, with some really stupid people there. Oh, one thing about my blogs I'm never directing them at anyone( UNLESS I SAY SO SPECIFICALLY), all I write about is what's on my mind. Sometimes specific are but I never really direct them at anyone. Yeah so there... I like doing this though, I think its a good way to get things off your mind. That's one of two reasons I write, I also write because I think(In my own opinion) some people need help. They may not notice it, but I'll always tell or show the truth on here. I would do nothing more or anything less. And I know that I may not always be right or have a just reason for doing so, but that's why I want feedback. Its nice to know what you people think. Yeah so enjoy (if you like), and if not then what ever, everyone has an opinion. The more and more I think about it, the more I think Blink is the band for me. They've gone threw all the same things, and have all the same fellings as myself. Plus I can play a lot of they're music. Ah the simple things in life...
