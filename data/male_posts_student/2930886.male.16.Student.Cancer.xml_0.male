I dont know i dont have much of interest to post, maybe track. I already broke one of my goal, in Javalin i have already thrown over 100 feet, actually my mark against Trumble was 111'2". I'm currently the best on Bunnell and Stratford high but chappy and that other kid havent thrown lately so I'm happy. Polish isnt bad, i just dont like it, its boring and i dont think i will use it, but on the bright side there are a cople of good looking people, and even the teachers look good, Jola wore a thong under her skirt, and it was so sheer you could see it. Lets see, I'm also working on a glider for a physics competition for school with me Constantinos and Jesse, really i am doing it to see his sister and flirt with her. Well i am also planning for the future, my classes for next year are scheudualed but i want to change them, and i want to see if i can get an intereship during the summer so i dont need to worry about work. And yes for all those wondering  it is 11 weeks and 1 day to my permit, which means 78 days till i have it, and 27 weeks till I can DRIVE.
