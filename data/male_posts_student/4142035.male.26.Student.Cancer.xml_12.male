Mostly because the guys who are serious about it often make a lot of noise when they train, are big and scary-looking, and are  urlLink brutally strong .  Some are using steroids, some are not.  Some truly are obnoxious assholes.  But the majority are either misunderstood because of a lack of social skills or simply mistreated because people tend to judge them based on a stereotype rather than actually getting to know the person.  Hug a powerlifter.  Ask him if it's OK first, though.  If you're a   urlLink hottie , just jump the guy and hug him to death.  We don't get a whole lotta action most of the time.  Too busy lifting weights.
