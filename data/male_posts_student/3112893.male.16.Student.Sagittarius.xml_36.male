Speaking of my cousin, I have also started a new blog with him called Unpasteurized with random stuff that seems funny at the time of posting. A longer and more accurate, but still brief and incomplete description can be found there; there being:  urlLink Unpasteurized  . Just spend a minute or 8 skimming it, will ya? Let us know what you think.  That is all.         -- Feanor
