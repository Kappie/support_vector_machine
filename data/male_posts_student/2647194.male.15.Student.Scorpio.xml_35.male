And the people who said they might, didn't. blerg. I'm itching to try and duplicate that double-shot that I literally dropped jaws with last week at the underground. lol. Maybe tommorow night or something. And don't ask me to describe that shot-I already tried it, and its quite hard to picture it. Just ask Amelia.  I should probably get my own cue sometime. Then I can become a pool-shark/hustler for the rest of my life. Great prospect, huh? Not really...  To quote Pat, "My head feels so...naked!" Yes, I did it. I had a hair cut. Now its short (omg!). I look like a whole different person, its kinda creepy. Hopefully my personality doesn't change-I like that the way it is very much. Grr...now I get cold quicker. Oh well, I'll grow it out again, and it should be long again by the time MITY rolls around. I lost so much hair...meh-I got pictures of me with the long hair right before I cut it lol.  Some people will probably look at me and say, "oh my god what did you do?", well, here's a Ben Folds Five lyric:  "What I've kept with me And what I've thrown away And where the hell I've ended up On this glary random day Were the things I've really cared about Just left along the way For being too pent up and proud  Woke up way too late Feeling hungover and old And the sun was shining bright And I walked barefoot down the road Started thinking about my old man Want to get into a car and go anywhere  Here I stand, sad and free I can't cry, I can't see What I've done Oh God, what have I done?  Don't you know I'm numb, man? I can't feel a thing at all Now it's all smiles and business these days I'm indifferent to the loss I have faith that there's a soul somewhere That's leading me around I wonder if she knows Which way is up and which is down  Here I stand, sad and free I can't cry, I can't see What I've done Oh God, what have I done?  I poured my heart out I poured my heart out It evaporated ... see?  Blind man at a canyon's edge Of a panoramic scene Or maybe I'm a kite that's flying high and random Dangling a string Or slumped over in a vacant room Head on a stranger's knee I'm sure back home they think I've lost my mind  Here I stand, sad and free I can't cry, I can't see What I've done Oh God, what have I done?"  -"Evaporated"  Yeah, my hair evaporated...lol.
