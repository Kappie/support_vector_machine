(I wonder if i'll get my bitter back, or if i want to) Friday night I went to the marq to meet P. and this guy he thought I should meet, R. That started a 14 and 1/2 hour long date. Tee Hee:) Than Saturday R. and I went to A. and A's housewarming party and were the most disgustingly cute couple ever. So fun, so cute. I've been grinning the whole weekend and totally feel utterly, utterly highschool. We had so much fun being th totally faggy cool kids, it was great. Party was so much fun. That's my news, as to the weather, no matter how cold and snowy it is, in the mood i am in right no it will feel sunny and tropical:)
