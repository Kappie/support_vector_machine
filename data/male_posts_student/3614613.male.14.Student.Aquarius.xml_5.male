The only consolation is that Mr. Ong called to say that a police report is not necessary. The only difficulty now is, where do I get 40 bucks... 2 booklets is worth $20 each...  I'm trying to borrow from my sister, but if she don't wish to lend me... We'll I'm quite resourceful.  Anyway, today I did CIP again after school... Honestly all that thing about grooming youngsters into becoming responsible and all those caring people are just poppycock. Yep, the word CIP sounds as ridiculous as the word "poppycock", check the dictionary. I learnt that word in an old "Archie" comic. Anyway, today's task was to pick up litter, which I did not. Haviender found a few thrash bags full of litter already, gathered from the bins around the school by one of the janitors already. How convenient. Then after that, I waited for WeiJin to finish his detention, meanwhile talking to the councillers there, persuading them to let weijin go early.  Anyway, the councillor there makes me feel like I'm a very lazy person, which I admit openly and freely. In terms of scouts and studies. But whatever, I still survive don't I?
