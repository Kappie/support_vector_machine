Would somebody please KNOCK SOME SENSE INTO THIS MAN!!!??? Specifically, I'm talkin' to  you , Dick Cheney, Mr. Let's-leave-gay-marriage-to-the-states. But oh yeah, I forgot, you backed off of that position - quite understandable when one takes into consideration your TOTAL LACK OF A SPINE. Urrgh!!!
