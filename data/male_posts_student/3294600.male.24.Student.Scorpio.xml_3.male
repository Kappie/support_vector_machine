In Intro to Operating Systems I took apart a laptop and was supposed to put it back together...Yeah, not so easy.  I ran out of time so Ilona said, "Okay then, we'll come back tomorrow."  Most everyone else was working on formatting hard drives, but I got to play around with hardware.  More on that later.  In English we worked on our papers that were due today and peer reviewed.  JavaScript is somewhat clicking; it's mostly copy and paste from those that know what they are doing (at least that's our instructor's version of JavaScript).  I would have liked to have learned it from scratch so I could write my own JavaScript by the end of the quarter, but that didn't happen.  After classes I came right home and had good intentions of working on my paper.  Instead, I crashed from 3:30 to 8:50.  When I woke up, I looked over at the clock and was said out loud, "Oh shit, that better be PM or I'm screwed."  Sure enough, it was PM and I didn't oversleep.  I had a weird dream about playing football at Mount Vernon High School as a 24-year-old.  It was odd.  When I woke up I worked on homework and chatted on-line.  I first talked with Jackie's sister Stac.  I learned that Cory, the guy they were going to fix me up with, is moving to New Orleans.  He's 18 and just out and wants to go to the gay mecha for school.  I was disappointed, but not surprised.  I'm happy for him and hope he does well, but uses condoms. :)  When Dale got home and I used his car (since my window doesn't go up and down easily) to go get food since I hadn't eaten all day.  One would think this would be a simple task.  I had already decided that I was going to go to Wendy's for fries and McDonald's for a burger.  My first stop, at Wendy's, went smoothly.  The trip to McDonald's, not so much.  As I pull up to the drive thru I see all their propaganda about being open 24-hours.  I sat there waiting and waiting and waiting to order.  No one came to the speaker, so I drove to the window and saw someone standing there.  I drove around again thinking, "okay, maybe they saw me now and will actually wait on me."  Oh no, I sat there and sat there and sat there.  Finally, I decided to stop and wait 'til the person at the window eating the McFlurry came to the window.  He didn't.  He looked at me and shook his head mouthing something (I'm sure it was "we're not open" or something to the effect).  All of a sudden he disappeared and another manager-looking person came to the window and I barely heard him say, "We're closed."  I said, "What happened to 24-hours?  Your signage everywhere says 24-hours."  He opened the window and said, "We're closed."  I repeated my question about 24-hours.  He said, "That's only on Friday and Saturday."  I explained that nothing was posted indicating that.  On the window was a phone number and name of the district manager.  I called and left a message.  I drove off upset and went to Jack In the Box.  Not that McDonald's is all that, but the employee eating the McFlurry (which I wanted) could have just come to the window and told me that from the beginning instead of me waiting there.  The manager guy lied to me when he told me it was posted on the sign, there was nothing.  Had it not been for my friend John sending me cute text messages that made me smile, I would have been pissed.    Along with Safeco Field (due to prices of Mariner tickets going up over $12 plus service charges per seat and the May Day for Marriage rally) I am boycotting McDonald's.  After eating yucky fast food, I chatted a little longer and went to bed.
