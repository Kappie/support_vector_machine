The trailers for the show has been going on for months, so naturally i was looking forward to it.The seating arrangement was cool, i was sitting with my two great friends Annabelle on my left and Joel on my right. The show actually starts off with a global warming conference in India, and we all know that that was when India started snowing, meaning to say that the "climate shift" was already beginning. oh shit....okay i have to rush to school for my orals, i'll continue in part 2. peace out.
