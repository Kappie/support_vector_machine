Yes, the so-called "best marketplace"      Check this link out:   urlLink http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00019PDNY/002-6306222-8387214?v=glance       While these assholes  think they are "proper" by censoring the show's name:  Penn and Teller: Bullshit!  By the way, this is a great show.     CHECK THE PICTURE NEXT TO THE ITEM OUT.  It says BULLSHIT.  So they censor the header, but not the picture... Why?  So people buy the product.  Capitalism.  Now, I'm against all censorship, and I'm also against being a hypocrite.
