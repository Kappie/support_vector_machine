And I am picky about the answers I want. I don't go for general term. I go for specifics. General answers never statisfy me. I am  THAT  fussy, and kaypoh.  I don't know. I feel like it is like me being shut out from the rest of the world, because I don't know anything. I hate being isolated.   I HATE IT  .   Okay. That was agressive. I am sorry. You know, with this noisiness, I could become an excellent reporter. Buay hao bai. I know.  I know many of you have taken in offense, one time or another, with my constant 'want to know'. I am sorry, but that's who I am. I can't change part of me, especially when I love this quality of mine so much. I do hope you understand. Sorry once again for the offense.
