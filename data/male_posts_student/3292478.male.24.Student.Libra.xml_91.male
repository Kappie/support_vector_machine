There are some incredible images being produced. This is at 22 weeks gestation, showing the baby's sensory skills developing to allow it to scratch, rub and pat his cheek and nose!   urlLink     The foetus has been shown to exhibit some behaviour identical to what it will do after birth. In this picture the foetus, when upright on a flat surface, tries to move forward.   urlLink     After birth, babies take up to 4-6 weeks before they smile. However, in the womb they can smile although the reasons for this are not yet known. Personally, I'm not sure I'd call this a smile, a 'gurn' maybe!   urlLink     And never mind finding comfort in sucking your thumb.  This baby has found himself a nice juicy big toe! Smell the cheese!   urlLink
