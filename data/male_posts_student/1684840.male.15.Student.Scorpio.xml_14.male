Weather has been normally hot and I'm just sitting here with a nice breeze coming from the fan above me :)  Made some Sour Raspberry Kool-Aid and sat around on the computer for most of the day...lol  I'm not missing British TV that much, the TV here is great, and I absolutely love the Mastercard adverts! LOL  Might be popping up the mall later... that should be fun!!  Bye for now :)
