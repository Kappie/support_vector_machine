Before the garbage people came TWO OF THEM WERE MISSING! Who the fuck steals garbage?   Second, today I was going to my Dads to do laundry. Some weirdo was sitting in a green Chevy blazer scoping myhouse out. I looked at the guy and he put his hand over his face. I go inside and he is still there, for at least 20 min. I go to leave but before I do I check out his license plate, MUNICIPAL PLATES.SHADY!!!!! I leave my house and the guy leaves the second I do.   This shit is freakin me out.
