Thomas, Jonah and I formed a Harmonica, Didjeridoo (sp?), Water Bottle praise band called Slippery When Wet. ummm.... Boycott Taco Bell. Pittsburgh with an H, or Pittsburg without an H? Say 'Bagel'. Fly, Fly, FLY!!!!!! TWENTY THREE GUITAR SOLOS! The Band. Sumo Wrestling. Global Partner Kickline. Jesse of the pink hair. Blithe, Darby, and Jazzimine. Starship Tiderious! Carry your Sandal....  Ok that made no sense to anyone but Thomas and Jonah, but I can't begin to describe everything that happened. Suffice it to say it was really weird, but really fun. Except maybe for the guitar solos.  Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!
