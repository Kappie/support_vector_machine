But nonetheless Skippy and Tyke met up with Tina, Frederique Frangelica, and Shawna Shawshank.  They also hung out with Macaroon and Tyronius but Amed Annoying was there as well so they made sure to not talk to him.  Skippy and Tyke were their usual studly selves and the three foxes were very impressed.  So they went back to Skippy's house and "had fun."
