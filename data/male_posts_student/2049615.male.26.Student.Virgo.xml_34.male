As you will glean from the previous posting today I went to the local chain bookstore and to the movies, where I saw Lars von Trier's  Dogville .  In general, it seems to me that von Trier does better when he's trying to make a point or experiment with cinematic form (cf.  Zentropa ) rather than fussing over his  j¾vla dogme ;  this movie, which assumes the mood of a Depression-era WPA agitprop play with a highly stylized set and mannered acting, is his most engaging in years.  The bookstore near the theater is, like most bookstores these days, probably about half-filled with extreme right-wing polemics decrying the Reds who control every movie studio, newsroom, and publishing house in America.  One of the less histrionic,  urlLink Spin Sisters  by Myrna Blyth, holds that violence against women is a myth propagated to make women vote Democratic.  Of course there are the typical Sean Hannity/Ann Coulter screeds, as well as the bittersweet memoirs of John Stossel, whose evil Liberal bosses forced him to go after hucksters who just wanted to make an honest living rather than the evil Democrats who were hellbent on selling this nation a bill of goods.  Oh, and did you know that Jimmy Carter coddles dictators?  In all fairness of course these are really the only examples;  like I said, the other half of the books in stock are all written by card-carrying pinkos.  Like the Lonely Planet guidebooks.  Those people are  totally  Stalin apologists.  Of course the easiest place to uncover the Socialist boogeyman has always been the motion-picture industry;  my Senator and yours Tailgunner Joe McCarthy knew it as well as we do, even if his estimation of the proportion of Communists and Social Democrats to right-thinking Americans was distorted by living in the People's Republic of Wisconsin, so well-known as a Red breeding ground that it merits mention in Lorne Michaels comedies;  hell, my Grandma is farther left than some people I know in the Bay Area.  It is therefore with apologies at the heavy-handedness (I may as well bring up that "Hitler is the only man in Germany who is not allowed to speak" Nazi propaganda cartoon from the '30s just to get it out of the way now) of the following that I turn your attention to one of the works of Fritz Lang, best-known as the director of  urlLink  M   and the near-director of  urlLink  Das Kabinett des Dr. Caligari  .  Instigators of highbrow consumerism  extraordinaire  The Criterion Collection (have to explain  urlLink this , though) have just released a big-ass must-have edition of Lang's  urlLink  Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse   (these German Expressionists really seem to have it in for doctors, don't they?).  The central conceit of  Das Testament  is that Nazi slogans are used as the insane, diabolical Dr. Mabuse's own.  The movie explicitly connects the Nazis (who at this point remember had not reached a position to annihilate six million people) with an evil madman.  Suppose that a filmmaker today were to take a similar, similarly clear moral and political stance, indicting a political figure's statements by running them to their fitting conclusion.  Suppose that filmmaker were a leftist.  That filmmaker would be crucified in the media and on the stateroom floor, and that movie would never get made.  Not for seven figures and points, anyway.  That movie gets made for four figures and it gets shown in public twice.  Lars von Trier's  urlLink  Dogville   has been widely criticized as  urlLink anti-American (subscription required; relevant quotation  urlLink here ; not too widely though, as the fantastically rightist  urlLink Chicago Tribune  seemed to like it) due largely to the fact that it is a movie made by a Dane in which Americans behave badly.  The fact that the movie, rather than being an accessible Hollywood blockbuster, was made in Sweden on a black soundstage with no "sets" per se for US$10M is probably solely responsible for the relative weakness of the public outcry.  The charges of anti-Americanism appear to stem as much from the closing montage of impoverished Americans from the Thirties to the present, accompanied by David Bowie's "Young Americans" as from the narrative itself which in conjunction with the aforementioned extreme stylisms appears to purport to be something singularly "American".  In von Trier's defense, it seems as though in his non-Dogme movies like this one,  Dancer in the Dark , and  Zentropa , the stylisms, plot, and moral (and with von Trier there's always a moral) are independent elements that are simply combined almost haphazardly as a sort of experiment in order to ground a general statement in a specific place, which paradoxically lends it an air of universal validity (because of apparent specific validity).   Dancer in the Dark , for example, has been related to von Trier's criticisms of the rights of immigrants  to Denmark , despite its being set like  Dogville  in the United States.  Despite the superficial Kafkaesque material, nobody can claim that  Zentropa  is a uniquely German (or Czech) story in the way that is happening with Dogville.  Another well-publicized current in von Trier's work is his real or supposed misogyny.  Widely-circulated reports of his psychological torture of Bjšrk on the set of  Dancer in the Dark  dovetail nicely in the public's psychological profile of a screenwriter known for heaping torment after sadistic torment on the heads of his selfabnegating female protagonists.  I have my doubts;  the Norwegian in me would suggest that perhaps von Trier's maltreatment of Bjšrk is borne less from misogyny than from the inborn Danish imperialist pig impulse to oppress other Scandinavians, and additionally although admittedly I have done little investigation into the subject there does not seem to be an invariant pattern of maltreatment of starring actresses in von Trier pictures.  Trier may well be a misogynist, but here the femininity of the protagonist, Grace, is less because of von Trier's desire to show a woman being degraded than because it denotes and renders more plausible her vulnerability to the quasi-state violence of the townspeople of Dogville.  The truly satisfying  denouement (YES I AM A PRETENTIOUS FUCK.  FUCK YOU, JACK.  YOU WANT AW SHUCKS/GEE WHIZ GO READ  urlLink AIN'T IT COOL NEWS ) of the movie betrays it, whatever the director's own inclination might be, as not an anti-American screed (an inherently leftist pursuit, evidently, these days) but an assault upon liberal values as they might be constructed by someone only slightly less hostile to the viewpoint that Bill O'Reilly.    Dogville  due to its length is the sort of movie on which one can reflect while it is still in progress.  As such, there was a point about halfway through when I projected for myself all the various ways in which this movie could end and not ring completely false.  A "happy ever after" sort of ending could be completely ruled out, as could one in which the heroine dies.  That was von Trier's last picture, and at any rate it would require the other characters to behave with a level of heroism or melodramatic villainy which none of them possessed, and which the narrative could not license them.  I admit that I am bragging when I guessed, quite early on, the correct general idea of the movie's ending, which I confirmed and fleshed out when the townspeople called the gangsters who had chased Grace to Dogville:  The Mob boss is Grace's father or lover and when he arrives in Dogville all of the townspeople will die bad deaths.  The ending of the movie justifies all of the horrors the script visits upon Grace, to the point that I guarantee you that you will be quite gratified to see an infant machine-gunned, and not entirely against yourself.  The violent catharsis at the end of the movie serves two purposes:  first of all, it expiates for the viewers the litany of sadism they have been forced to endure through Grace for the preceding three hours, and second, it serves as the illustration (for this refer to the movie) of the moral, which is set out in the dialogue between Grace and her kingpin father.  Von Trier has ironically elected to convey the message of the movie through a gangster, one of American cinema's most immoral mainstays;  ironically, except of course that the conflicted, moral underworld figure is almost more common in American movies than his more realistic, sociopathic variant. In his analysis Grace has allowed herself to become the victim of all of these vicious acts precisely because she refuses to judge their perpetrators, forgiving them as products of their environment.  The moral relativism causing her to forgive repeated rape and constant dehumanization is identical to the sort of moral and cultural relativism espoused by Western leftist intellectuals and decried by their conservative counterparts who accuse them of being apologists for this and that.  With her execution-style killing of her erstwhile lover Thomas, her most subtle and egregious oppressor, she makes a full conversion to her father's viewpoint in such a way that indicates where the filmmaker's own sensibilities lie;  in  Dogville  the ultimate solution is violence in the service of moral censure.  Comfortingly, however, this movie's central charge will never be picked up and carried by those most sympathetic to it.  Try convincing your average conservative pundit that any European isn't a Socialist.  As far as anyone in a position to benefit from the propaganda use of this film is concerned, it's just another arthouse flick trying to run down the good ol' US of A agin.
