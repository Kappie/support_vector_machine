In the starting, I always let him go first, so as usual, the first turn, I overtake him again(or is it the second turn??) Than, bah bah bah, I won....than the best thing is, I level up!!W00t! Nice!!Than arh, Nicholas ask me can let him win or not, he say he will use his credits, I think for a while than say ok lor....I also say I change cars to GC8 first, Wahlao...the worst part is this liao....give him 500m lead before I go sia....in the end, I almost overtake him, I must let go my petal in order not to overtake him sia...ppl see me do that arh, will call me siao sia....anyway, after that Tux came, and Nicholas ask Tux to help him defeat some of the computers in the story mode, I was like, wtf?? Nicholas, why cant you do it yourself??? Oh well, than Taka came, at first I do not know who he is, this is what he say:  Taka: So what car you want me to use? Me: huh, who are you? Taka: I am Taka Me: oh Taka: what car you want me to use? Me: Anything lor Taka: No, I must let you choose, cos you are here for Trial Me: ok lor...let me think...how about RX-8? Taka: ok  and so, we started to race, I choose the track randomly cos i feel random is the best way to choose, it chose Iro, wth Iro??I was thinking, I sure lose one...in the starting arh, wah my fc and his rx-8(it was a stock car) same speed, but in the end I overtake him, cos of the first turn, than bah bah bah, he overtake me in the jumping part, omg I miss the jump???Than I try to overtake him in the next turn, but it fail, cos he also jump....in the end, he stop to let me pass the finishing line, i was like, wtf? I should lose....I ask why,he say he dont want to waste my credits, such a nice guy huh??Next race he chose akagi downhill, wet..cos in the forum I ask him to choose akagi one what...he let me go 200m lead before he start....he was catching up!!wah, he really pro...but in the end I won, cos i think he got bang the wall or something, I won by only around 70m i think??Pro right that Taka??  Taka: ok I will tell uncle sad about you Me: Er...ok  that wai seng came....we told wai seng to wait for his turn slowly, me and nicholas go eat first...bah bah bah, nicholas treat me to cheese fries, he is a good 'brother' right??Than we went to zone x, see got two noobs there playing...I advise him to change view, he dont want, oh well, feel like challange him to a race, but better save the money for something else ya??We went back to funland, saw wai seng playing liao...he say he cant beat that shomaru first guy, ask me to help, I say ok lor...I help him lor...in the end I overtake the computer and won for wai seng lor...dunno what I do in my last life, need to help my friends beat the computer one(I hate myself for being the only pro in Initial D, and not my friends that are pro, and I am not talking about Aegis and Tux)Oh well, in the end we went home....wow I have type a lot today...hehe, I keep this up, and your eyes will go round and round,lolx
