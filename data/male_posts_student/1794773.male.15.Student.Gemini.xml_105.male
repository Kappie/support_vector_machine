Someone call me or something and talk to me about it. I have bandanas too Erica, if you dont wanna bring yours. Yes, we should talk about Cedar Point. That would be awesome to go, it would kinda be like the last summer  thing with our Pajama Gang! I'm thinkin i might rent: Confessions of...., 13 going on 30, and if the Prince and Me is out too. How does that sound? I'm so excited!! Love, Rach
