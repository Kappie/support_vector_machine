School was fine and the Tolo assembly was good, especially the video.  Haras and Karla did great jobs in their parts.  They are just so sexy.  As school progressed it got a little bit worse all the while but it was nothing too bad.  After school Tyke and Skippy got all ready for their ping-pong tournament.  It was pretty danged fun.  Quite a few people there in fact.  Tyke took out Macaroon in the first round but Tyke played really well.  Macaroon did a pretty good job but Tyke's return spinners were too much to handle.  The second round saw Tyke facing off against Skippy.  Which was bad.  Tyke was never able to take a commanding lead really and just lost it for a little bit.  He took a 7-6 lead and it was game point but Skippy came back and took the next 3 points to win.  It was, as Tyke believes, an upset but Skippy did deserve the W as he just played better than Tyke.  After a little while Ekul and the Sly Lion boys came over to partake in the action.  Ekul owned hardcore.  He is very very good and he did even bring his own paddle and shaving cream with which to smooth off his paddle.  Yeah, he is hardcore serious.  But extremely good too.  He won it all although he didn't get recognition for it necessarily because of his standing at another school.  But he was the best there.  And that is what matters most.  After this Tyke went home and this is when it got crazy.  He and his mom talked for a little about Tyke's Tolo outfit.  He put on the outfit and got it for her and they tried to decide what to add.  Then they thought about where they could find some good ideas after the internet didn't come up with anything good.  So Tyke's mom told him to go get The Great Gatsby movie from Blockbuster.  So he did.  While there, this girl said she really liked his Aviators and then asked if he was from Yakima.  Tyke said he just bought the shirt that had Yakima on it last night at Value Village and that he hadn't done the Habitat for Humanity thing.  Then the girl said that she had a friend who did "the stupid th...oh not that it was stupid."  Tyke interrupted and said that he didn't do it so he didn't care.  Then he got the movie and walked away.  He came back and he and his mom were watching it when his dad called and he had a doctor's appointment scheduled for the day and he was calling to say that he had to go to the hospital to have them look at his little problem.  So that was something weird.  But Tyke and his mom watched Great Gatsby when all of a sudden Macaroon showed up unexpectedly at the back door while the movie was on.  So that was weird.  Then he came in and sat down for a while as they watched and got ideas.  So finally Tyke found what he was doing.  And then Tyke's dad called again.  And he told them that he had to get surgery tonight on this hernia thing he has and that was totally unexpected.  But it wasn't major so there wasn't need to worry.  So Tyke's mom had to rush to the hospital and Tyke and Macaroon went down to Redmond again to try and get some of Tyke's costume stuff finally.  But the place was closed.  So they went to Value Village to shop some more for Tyke.  He ended up finding a good suit jacket to go with his get-up and then he had pretty much everything he needed besides the hat and suspenders.  But those can be purchased tomorrow still.  At Value Village they saw some fellow Issy's and talked for a little.  Then they went back home and watched some hoops before going to the lacrosse game at the school.  It was just Tyke, Macaroon, and Piggy J for a while which was cool.  Piggy was insane and wearing shorts.  Then he kept asking Tyke for the blanket that was smartly accompanying Tyke and keeping him warm.  But Tyke politely declined everytime.  After a while all of the ladies came.  Dotti, Haras, Tina, Purdy, Mandy, Tig, etc.  So they talked for a while.  And Haras gave Tyke some stoned crackers which tasted really good and Tina talked to Tyke about her gross-out things and Dotti and Tyke talked about his hectic day.  It was pretty much heaven.  A very cold heaven.  But then Tyke had to go to the hospital to pick up his dad's car cuz it was there and he couldn't drive.  So he went back to his house and Dotti came and picked him up.  They drove down to Bellevue and had a great talk.  It was really really great and Tyke didn't want it to stop.  But Tyke's mom called as they were about to get on 405 and said that they couldn't pick up the car anyway.  So they had to turn around and go back to Tyke's house.  But they still got to keep talking and that was extremely enjoyable.  After getting home they went in Tyke's house and chatted it up there for a while.  Then Tyke's parents got home at about 11 and they went upstairs and talked to them for a little.  Tyke's dad seemed pretty good considering he had surgery a little while ago.  So he is fine.  But then Dotti left and Tyke and his mom talked about their plans for tomorrow and filling up Tyke's brother's car's gas tank and picking up Tyke's dad's car and going out to Redmond again for some costume things and then going to Dotti's at 11:50 for Activity A of Tolo.  So Tyke will be getting up before 9 to do all of that.  Man, this is a crazy time right now.  But it is fun.  A lot of good things happening.  And nothing that is that bad.  So wow, Tyke needs to get some sleep.  This is just weird.
