It turns out that I have a Physics test on nuclear and radioactive decay tomorrow. And the best thing about that, is that I have spent today’s evening mugging and covering my own ass. So, I think I have been hardworking enough to actually pass off a routine studying for a test as revision.                    Maybe I’ll just tell you folks out there about how I study perhaps. It’s the TYS. Eat it. Get 40 questions out of 45 correct for the entire topic and you’re it. No need for further revision on the topic until the next big paper. Another tip: Jon came in just now and started to disturb me and tempt me with the prospect of leveling up my onimusha 3 character Sanosuke by at least 2 levels. So I did it, leveled up Sanosuke by, lemme check, okay, 3 levels. Normally this doesn’t excite me particularly but me doing it during the revision and actually up 3 levels in a go boasts to me how far I can actually go if I had wanted to. Wow. Haha. Anyway, I politely (believe it), refused Jon when he asked me to play a bit of Crimson Skies: High road to revenge. Might as well be no, he would trash me all out anyway. Then I went back quietly to Big Bad Revision with the comp speakers blazing away on MXPX. Way cool. Until I decided to grab a cup of Meiji Pasteurized Milk which resulted in this terrible stomach upset at about 9pm, about when I’m entering this blog. Shit, I feel another one swelling up. Remind me to pour the rest of the milk into Alyssia’s Car’s Petrol tank. Would love to see it having loud, uncontrollable diarrhea that has a frequency of about 0.0017Hz (about 10 mins). Man! If I have a natural shitting frequency of 0.0017Hz, there would be major resonance and a whole lot of crap. If that happens, I would, and anybody who knows me, pay a million bucks to find any solution with Seriously CRITICAL damping effect. Another tip: Quote academic topics in practical situations and find out what the fuck is so funny about it. Why Alyssia? Cause she’s got a car that looks like shit, and I had said it at the gas station that it wouldn’t matter whether petrol or shit is used, makes no bloody difference. If your car looks like Bob taking a shit, it’ll look like Bob taking a hit no matter what Bob (or the car) ate. (The character Bob is taken from a song I had forgotten the name, will let you know if I ever hear it again). Alright, I have deviated far enough. The fiasco with Alyssia’s probably years ago. Hey! Whaddayounoe? I have the most excellent memory!                   So anyway, the deal with the Meiji Milk isn’t over, I hope that when I watch the amazing race later, I don’t go to the toilet like every commercial break. Cause that would mean I’m resonating with the shit. I’m resonating with DA SHIT manz. And nobody, I repeat, nobody would like to see the shit amplitude to increase like a insatiable juggernaught. That would almost certainly make Bob proud however.                   I’m    kin-da (when I’m typing “kinda” it spells Linda, for some obscured reason, I hadn’t known, obviously) hoping that this time, my favourite team of the week doesn’t get eliminated again. Trust me, all the other episodes? My favourite teams always got eliminated. Maybe I can turn this to my advantage………My favourite team this week is Snow White and her pathetic dwarf. Cant no longer stand the midget’s convoluted face. Convoluted: Intra-nephron vessels that absorb water, sugar, ions and other stuff you don’t see (or taste) in your pee.                   Oh I see! Microsoft Office’s Autocorrect function has a strain that says Substitute: Kinda. For: Linda. Bitch, don’t even know anyone with such a slutty, bromine name. (Compliments to Jia Mao for telling me the meaningof the word bromine)
