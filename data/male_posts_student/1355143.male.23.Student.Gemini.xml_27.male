They're expecting actual temps of -24 Celsius today (-31 Celsius with windchill factor). But that's North Dakota...it's a balmy -19 Celsius at my house right now. So, basically it's cold. But enough about the weather. It's just depressing.  I assume everyone got royally smashed on New Year's. I didn't because the party ran out of beer...apparently a CEMS student planned the party (I kid, I kid). But this past week a friend got me and my girlfriend free tickets to a Chicago Bulls game, and while Jordan is no longer in Chicago, $85 tickets in the second row right behind the Bulls' bench still helped to soothe any residual pain from New Year's. While at the game, a friend posed an interesting question: at what point do you switch from "X years old" to "X years young." I don't know if this is only an American thing, but oftentimes you will hear an announcement that Granny Smith or some such is 90 years YOUNG today. I consider myself 20 years OLD. So at what age does the switch occur? Just a curiosity of the language, perhaps. Perhaps the question is a waste of your time, but you'll have to forgive me. You see, it's really not my fault. Ulli's friend commented that I was quite the pen, and now I've gotten quite a big head and think I can type whatever I want in this space. Now I know you all have better things to do than check this blog (stop laughing), so forgive me for wasting your time. The last thing we want is another monumental time-waster like Emerging Economies. But I must practice lest my writing skills become under-der-vey-lo-ped (yeah Puig!).   I must say that, other than my friends, I miss the good football most about Barcelona. My girlfriend gets the Premiership, but on a premium channel at like 3 in the morning on Sunday morning, or something ridiculous like that. And watching football with your girlfriend, who could care less, at 3 am is no Scobie's. But at least we agree that footballers are hot (as a former youth footballer, I feel it is absolutely necessary to promote this stereotype to the fullest of my ability).  But alas, your eyes tire and your minds wander, so until next time......   Hasta la pasta, Timmy Tim Tims
