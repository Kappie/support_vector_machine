Its really claustrophobic when i cant see anything, all a big blur. Not lost, but claustrophobic, like i m confined to my inner thoughts. No sight no nothing. So i turned to music...sorta worked...over worked my eyes prolly...  I once said i'd rather lose my sense of hearing then my vision, but i dunno if tts true animore...it would really depress me to not be able to draw, but not being able to enjoy music? tts worse in a way...i dunno i hope neither will happen to me...
