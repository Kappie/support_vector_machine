Why can't I just die?" And somewhere inside me will reply will always say,"You can't die now... Think about the people around you, what will happen to them if you die?"But, another part of me will reply,"They will rejoice and celebrate, so, why don't you just die? End all your misery and suffering..." And, I usually end up choosing to live... Just because of one reason... But, I won't say it out here, in this web log... If the person reading this wants to know the reason I choose to live, find out yourself...  I thought i was going to die today... After swimming today, I felt kinda dizzy... I felt like vomitting... I just told myself that nothing will happen, I am just making myself think i am dizzy... Then, I got on my dad's motorbike... The bike started moving abit, then, i really felt like vomitting... On the way back, I ask my dad to stop the bike, i felt damn dizzy... Then, i closed my eyes... When i opened them, I couldn't see a thing... Everything was also quiet... I think i also couldn't hear a thing... It was quite a scary experience... I kept on vomitting... Everything was white... couldn't see anything... This went on for about 10 minutes...   Anyway, I know i won't die that easily... But, i don't think anyone will care... I think I m going to the hospital now, to see the doctor, so, bye bye... Hope i may live to continue blogging...
