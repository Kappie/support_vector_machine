I have a PC dedicated to my Television for recording like a TiVo, but it is in a normal case, shoved behind the entertainment center so it is out of sight.  I control it through a wireless connection from my primary PC.  This guy built this system from scratch out of plywood and UV reactive plexiglass.  Really an amazing job, and the article goes into exhaustive detail, if you are interested.  At least look at the pics on the first page.
