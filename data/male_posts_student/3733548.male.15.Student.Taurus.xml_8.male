I'm gonna go play my guitar for the rest of the night tonight, and eventually fall asleep as I normally do when I need to think deeply. maybe I really need to breathe deeply, take a break, but I cant. Umm, the word "umm" just epitomizes that which I am feeling right now... I'll explain in the morning im too tired and blank minded to know right now...ive got church in the morning.
