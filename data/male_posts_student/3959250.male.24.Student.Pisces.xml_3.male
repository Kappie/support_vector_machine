But it sure was worth it cos i just came back from eating steamboat at Tampines Mall...yum yum....din expect the tom yam soup base to be so spicy haha.And then after the satisfying meal,it was off to watching a movie...guess what??????I , ROBOT!!!! It sure ROXXX man... i alwiz like every single show Will Smith acts in...although i din manage to catch Ali.I sure recommend everyone who reads my blog to go and watch the show :)  And after the show....amazingly,i saw not one,not two but three of my secondary school mates.two of them were my classmates and woah hehe he has a pretty gf liaoz :) Congrats to him.  Guess its a good way to sign off for the night.  Cheerios everyone ;)  Joshy
