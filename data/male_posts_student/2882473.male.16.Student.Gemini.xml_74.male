But that then makes me think of most tv programmes now, which are also pretty bad. I have now realised that there is no programme series that I watch regularly, such as every week/day. I have no tv commitments any more, since The Simpsons was taken off BBC2, and Friends finished on C4. But then, I suppose this is a good thing,a s tv really is a waste of time.  Firstly, I shall see what is on BBC1 this morning (BBC1 being the most watched channel, probably). 0930 - To Buy Or Not To Buy 1000 - Bargain Hunt 1100 - Trading Up 1145 - Cash In The Attic  Can you believe that? 4 auction-type shows in a row! Tv really has gone downhill... I wonder if anyone actually does make a point of watching these programmes. They seriously can't be interesting. And there are so few programmes with proper actors in them anymore, especially on BBC1. All we get now are documentaries and reality shows, with the occasional soap. Which reminds me - Soaps are terrible! I can't think why so many people watch them. The story lines generally go along this line. Person A is boyfriend/husband of Person Z. Person B also likes Person Z. Person Z likes Person B more than Person A. Person Z's best friend, Person Y secretly tells Person A that Person Z doesn't like him, but Person B. Person A goes on a mad rampage, killing Person B. Person Z is now distraught, and blames Person Y for the tragedy. Person A and Person Z are now in a bad marriage/relationship. Person Y leaves town, blaming herself, and is assumed dead from an exploding car. Ten years later, (after a failed music career) Person Y comes back, to find Person A and Z have had a child, but have split up. Person Y then falls in love with Person A. Person Z is distraught, and kills herself. Etc etc etc. Wow, I could write a soap opera. They're not so hard. These are generally the terrible story-lines that are on at least 10 times a week from a number of different soaps. And then a few years later, the story is repeated but with Person C, Person D (person A's grown up, criminal Son) Person W and Person X.  And then there is reality tv shows, which I have blogged about before. Cruel ecperiments on peopls such as sleep deprivation, or just being watched and tricked for weeks on end. And people volanteer (sp?) for these? For a few weeks of fame. How foolish some people are. And then a few weeks after the series is finished, one of the 'house-mates' is spotted going into a laundarette, and a double page article is written about it in a magazine. (I actually saw this in a magazine in my house, about one known as 'Jade') Why would people want to know where others do their washing?  And then Childrens tv, which is also much more terrible than my day. Did you ever see that Basil Brush Show? *shudders* That was almost unbearable. And Teletubbies? WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?!?!?! Giant... things... who eat custard and toast and can't even speak. Kids programmes should be educational. Blue Peter has also gone downhill too. Only a few months ago I saw some terrible band (might have been 'busted' or 'mcfly', or one of those types. Maybe 'blazing squad'. Yes, probably them) performing their 'modern' music to the youth of today. This is terrible, I blame this music for many of the troubles in todays youth. Bands like these are caught taking drugs in night clubs, beating bar tenders up, or carrying knives or guns around with them for 'protection'. They should be setting an example to youth! And then youth copy them, and we have the gun crime on the increase, more and more people taking drugs... what was it I heard... 1/4 of 15 year olds have tried drugs or something like that. It was very shocking, whatever the statistic was.   And then adverts on during kids tv. Advertising McDonalds or CocaCola, corrupting the youth of today. And then you get all this 'healthy Mcdonalds salad' and 'Ribena (sp?) toothkind, as approved by the British Dental Assosiation. I sense some corruption here. 'Of course, next time I  would  prefer the inconspicous brief-case to the sack with a dollar sign on it...' Young children, watching their pathetic programmes see these adverts, and watch the kids in them enjoing what is obviously a drink or meal that does more harm than a bag of sugar, and worry their parents for them. These parents, who cannot take the screaming any more, give in, and the child eats and eats, getting larger and larger, until we become like America. And don't even get me started on America, I would be here all day. Maybe another time, as revision is calling me.  Wow, that was a long rant, much of which I have blogged about before, but it feels good to 'let go of all that hatred and anger and your journey towards the dark side will be complete'  I best do some maths revision, additional maths being quite challenging. May do a bit o' business too, as the first exam didn't too well; (See the blog before this to find out why). Or a bit o' physics, I haven't done anything for that yet, and I have the first exam on Tuesday, with maths and business on Monday.  Bye for now.   Weather:  Overcast, looks like rain is comming  Reading:  Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban. Yes, still. I won't finish them all in time now.  Listening to:  A weird version of the Element Song  Watching:  Guess. Yes, go on, you'll never guess.  Nothing . Nothing at all. Not even an electronic sausage.  Confused about:  Long division, with polynomials (I think that's what they are called)  Annoyed with:  Quite a lot. You should know, after reading all that.  Mood:  Grumpy.
