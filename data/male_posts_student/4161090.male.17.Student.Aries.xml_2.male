The answer to life Ok, at least the correct question  Part I: against entropy  And just before the universe was born A very sacred law lay destroyed Something disturbed nothingness into infinity Something forced existence into a void  And this is the untamed energy called god A rowdy entity from an unknown infinite Is god the bringer of light in the darkness? Or the bringer of darkness in the light?  For the rate of degradation of the universe Is this thing that the scientist call entropy Because as a rule everything in the system Tends to return to equal and neutral energy  And every excited system gains equilibrium And nothing internal can disturb it again Some external unbalanced force must act And that’s why our life is so hard to explain  The question of life is one of basic existence Because nothingness was a neutral sea And someone from outside churned out a storm What a wonderful realm this outside would be  Where everything can be spontaneously dynamic Where there are no limiting laws like entropy In simpler terms, the perpetual motion machine Instead of an eternal dream is an everyday reality  And so the search for the perpetual motion machine The search for a realm that our sciences defy Is in effect the search for the meaning of life A search for the answer to the eternal ‘why?’         Part II: the troubled mind  The teacher dared to ask a question A question that had only troubled all But he even dared to seek an answer But he only found his own downfall  He ran away from his comfortable home He left his work, his wife, and his kids behind Searching for the answer with his body and soul And getting nothing of what he expected to find  He roamed the streets as a begging sage  Weighing the possibilities in his own mind And not a thousand thoughts gave a solution And life as always remained undefined  Life isn’t easy for a begging sanysi  And sometimes he didn’t get enough food But his mind feasted on a thousand thoughts And his body’s hunger was thus subdued  And the wind chilled his aged body And the harsh sun tried to torture him Like the gods were trying to keep it secret And he grew haggard, and weak, and thin  And on his last beautiful monsoon  His body was chilled by the biting rain He let it fall; after all, it fell only on his body But the deadly fever even reached his brain  But deeper still he dwelt on his thoughts And the truth suddenly burst into his head And he died just as he was enlightened But it was only his body that was dead  -Aditya MJ
