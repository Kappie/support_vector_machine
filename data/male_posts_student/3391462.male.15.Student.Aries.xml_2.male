I like the public life, there is more diversity and you are just another person in the crowd and by the time that you noticed the school year is up. $15,100 is pretty expensive and quoting Lauren Smilanich "High Class" people seem to be an overstatement. People need to understand that they aren't the finest of the fine because they are on a free ride in an expensive car, they believe that they can judge people because they are better than others and I am the one person here that cannot stand it! I don't understand why people can just be there and pick and choose the people that they like based on the looks and the perchance lack of dignity that other have from trying to deal with them. It just sickens me! At public school we had none of this, because there where so many races in the school that people liked the company of other races, at our school a black kid or Asian is a rarity at best. The ability to receive help is the best thing possible and the fact is that the more help the better, you can slack off and get bad grade and feel like the man, but not many people get that being a good kid can do better for you in the long run. I just think that there is a barrier somewhere that should have been broken between the public and private, just because a school is public doesn't mean they are all poor, and because there are a lot of kids are stuck up at my school doesn't mean that in fact all private school kids are snobs. Don't Judge it makes worse of the situation.
