Because I have to get going to TRHS, I'm going to make this one short, sweet, and to the point.  -2003: Amber Calls A Theme Park Ride a Bitch!- Alright, so we take a few hours off of the busy work schedule to go to Islands of Adventure, and, surprisingly, we get on all the rides (except my personal favorite, Spiderman, but, hey, we ran out of time).  Anywho.  We get on the Dudley Do Right's Ripsaw Falls thingy, and, we came down one of those minor drops, and Amber gets soaked.  Well, she found a platform where she could get off.  Meanwhile, Adam back in another car could be heard screaming like a girl (it's supposedly a trademark).  Amber starts calling the ride a bitch, using every freakin' word like shit, fuck, you know, those words.  I thought it was pretty funny, because it was the first time I really saw her act like that, and over a little bit of water!!!  I think it was mainly because we had gotten soaked on the water flume thingy.  Oh well.  It was funny.  Now I gotta get off to school.  I'll be back at noon, so I'll post something when I get back, if I feel like it.  Until next time, fools, theme park rides don't mean to be a bitch.
