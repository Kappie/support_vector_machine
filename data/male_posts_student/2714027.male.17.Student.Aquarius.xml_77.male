Tomorrow's Maths Statistics (not too bad) and Computing (moderately easy), but with so many close togther, it's hard to concentrate and prepare yourself. Physics (hard for me) is on Monday; three exams one after the other. There's too much pressure and such a risk of failing that it gets to you. I know I'd be totally gutted if I got bad results and I can't help thinking that it's going to happen. Still, I think I might have got an A in Geography and should get an A tomorrow in Computing. Maths is the real stinker though; I didn't do as well as I could in Mechanics and Pure was just plain hard. Tomorrow's Statistics is my only chance to pull my grades up.  It's summer and I should be outside being artistic and photgraphing stuff, playing games and writing about them, relaxing and being generally lazy. I shouldn't have to be cooped up inside trying to revise! Life really is a bitch sometimes...
