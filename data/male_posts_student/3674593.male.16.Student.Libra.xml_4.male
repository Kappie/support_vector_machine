ARGH!!! but overall, its been an ordinary week. last wednesdae went to yusoff ishak... found that their chess is quite lousy so taught them some basics. this week probably staying back at jj with eva to look after chess club ba... then after tt mayb go watch concert wif old pal roy... c how ba...  but so angry hor... my form teacher mr chan up to now haven give my pw grp back our SECOND(!!!) draft... like wth lor.. haiz lidat lor. haf to go coerce him tml into giving it back ba. well, ok la, gtg slp le. sign off here.
