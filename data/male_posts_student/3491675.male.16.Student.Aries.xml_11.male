It's very tirying going to the mall everyday now, we've been going to the mall almost everyday now shoping, and it's really been tiring my legs since i happen to intentionally wonder off and walk non-stop everywhere, I'm goin gmostly to torrid to keep an eye on those jeans, i could go to hot topic and buy them for a higher price but i choose to wait and so i can be like mom i need money i would buy them if i have enough but my money mysteriously vanished when someone asked for gas money preferablyyou and since i don't have a job i think you owe me! Today is one of those day's where im just looking around the web and listening to random music, at the current moment I'm listening to Alanis morisete and I'm going to listen to Bjork, haha while talking about alanis as it turns out I'm listening to that you oughta know song  thesupposed Female anthem , she sounds like such a crackwhore in this song it's true, she really sounds like one in this song tear. well The relative's have decided to stay a week longer than expected 3 day's *morbidly obese tears* my poor legs they're going to die if i keep walking like this.
