Later I asked her, in a joking kind of way to explain, and it was just how I was facing a lot of fears by being there with her for this particular instance.  She said she was proud of me.  That means a lot to me.  God really knows what he's doing, I guess.  He takes the most unlikely things and uses them for His glory and to help us through things, or for us to help others through things, and by which, we gain unrequested rewards ourselves.  I'm glad that it's happening, but even if it didn't, I'd still do what I've been doing.  I don't know what else to do, but I AM going to be there for her.  She's an amazing person, and I want to see her soar.
