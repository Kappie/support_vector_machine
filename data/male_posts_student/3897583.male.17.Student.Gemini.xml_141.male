We've decided that we will state in a lucid manner what we are looking for and what we are not looking for. This log entry shall get a permanent link on the sidebar so that we can easily point people to it. Let me get to the point now.  We want members in the following categories:      Senior Quizzing (Class X to XII)     Debating, Declamation  Group Discussion (Public Speaking - Class IX to XII)     Software Display (Programmers in VC++, VB  who have made some kind of software )     Junior Programming (Class VI to VIII, knowledge of QBASIC)     Senior Programming (Class X to XII) applicants   please read:  We have many good senior programmers in Exun already and quite frankly we're saturated at the moment. Our priority right now is to send the existing programmers for events and competitions. Taking new programmers at this stage will do nobody any good. You may still apply for Senior Programming but be assured that unless you're really brilliant, your chances of getting in are low.   Junior Programming  Since QBASIC is no longer taught at Class VIII level (instead Visual Basic is taught), the Programming Department of Exun is planning to conduct a Logic Test for Class VIII very soon, from which promising students will be trained in QBASIC.   Software Display  Students who have made software in Visual Basic or Visual C++ (any software with a GUI) are invited to come and show their software to us (see below). We're looking for good software that can be sent for Software Display competitions.   Senior Quizzing  The toughest amongst them all. Hop along if you think you know about computers and we'll test you (see below).    Other categories  are:      Digital Imaging     Flash Animation     Web Designing    For these three, students are expected to bring a piece (or pieces) of original work and show it to us. We can judge you then. Again, see below.   See belows  Wherever See Below has been mentioned: Exun members are present in the eGurucool Lab (F-Block) during Break time everyday. Look for the Presidents (Maanick Nangia or Karan Misra) and if you can't find them, try to locate Mr. Mukesh Kumar. You can also email at  urlLink exunclan@gmail.com  or comment on this post if you have any queries (or if I forgot to mention something).  --Karan
