There were some road blocks and disappointments that i went through but in the end i guess it turned out ok. I must say that im excited that schools going to be over but im not excited about all my friends who ive known, ranging from 1-8 years, will be leaving and maybe never being seen again. The time has come when we got to move on and make new friends....but i never thought it would come this soon. Its also sad not being able to see some of my favorite teachers every day next year. We wont be able to walk in and see their smiling (mean face for MR. B jkjkjk) face as we walk to our desk. But life does move on and there is a time for everything like it says in the Bible. We'll after that sad note....graduation is hear in 2 days and our party in tomorrow. Its going to be so much fun! I g2g and study for my last 2 finals and i need to spend a lot of time on them because honestly they're going to be my hardest. Im out...
