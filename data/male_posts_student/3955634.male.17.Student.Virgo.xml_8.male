The  urlLink Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports :   The "PantsOnFire-Mobile" is a trailer pulled behind a car. The Bush character is wearing a flight suit with the words "Mission Accomplished" emblazoned on the back, a reference to the president's declaration that major hostilities had ended in Iraq. An electronic ticker on the front shows what Cohen says are Bush's lies.   Furthermore, the effigy's lower half is notably enflamed, lending some context to the aforementioned title of the nomadic display.  With two PantsOnFire-Mobiles now in commission, Cohen plans to have them tour the entire nation nonstop until Election Day, November 2nd. So far the project has visited five states.
