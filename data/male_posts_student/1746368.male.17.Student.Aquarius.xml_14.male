I think I usually just skip the main page and go to my email straight away. You know, me being as popular as I am, I got to stay current with my fans (err...I have changed the meaning of fans to be like two or three people who email me, and the rest junk mail).   Let me think.   Monday: Don't really remember what I did. Doesn't really matter anymore, seeing as it was two days ago. I know I watched Chris, because my mom started school and he ended school (ironic huh? Same day he ends it, my mom starts it).   Tuesday: Pretty much the same story, don't remember what I did, doesn't matter, watched Chris. I actually have started a vigorous training program with Super Smash Bros. Melee. I have switched my main character around. One of my friends showed me the flaws in the character I was using. I started training with someone who was really like him (from the same game in fact). I actually completed a lot more than I had with my original. For all you SSBM fans, I was using Falco, but he showed me that Fox is so much better. I might explain why he is better later.  Today: I went to a pool party with my church. As anyone reading this knows, I didn't swim, cause I can't, and I'm afraid. I jumped on the trampoline with a few friends. That was quite fun. I stood around and talked, played piano. I don't usually like playing piano, mostly because it feels like I'm showing off. I don't mind playing at recitials, because that's what I'm supposed to do. I also don't mind playing for friends who ask me specfically. Unless it's requested, and nobody else minds, I don't play.  Well, thats all folks. You know at the end of all those Loony Tunes shows where Porky comes out and stumbles over a word. Have you ever wondered what word he is really stumbling over. It starts with a "D", but I don't know what it is. Oh well, goodnight everyone.
