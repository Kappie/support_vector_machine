Sorry I haven't updated for a while. I only really have one story. The other night, I went out with Megan (formerly of RadioShack fame), because it was one of her friends going away celebration type things. Anyway, when I got there, Terry Anderton and Kelsey Lavoie were both there. I was super surprised to see Terry (I knew Kelsey and Megan were kind of chummy). It's such a small city.  And that's really all the news I have.
