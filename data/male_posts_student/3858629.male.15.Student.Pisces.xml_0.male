I'll then drive to Erie to catch my plane to Pittsburgh, and from there it's a direct flight to Florida.  Now, Erie's not the biggest of airports. But wouldn't it be fun to be chased through the airport/chase someone through an airport, like Ross chasing Rachel or Seth chasing Anna? Which is proof I watch too much 'Friends' and too much 'The O.C.'  If my relatives have internet access, there's a chance I may blog a bit from the Sunshine State, but it's doubtful I'll be updating much.  Enjoy the weather in  your  homestate, whilst I finally get a tan.
