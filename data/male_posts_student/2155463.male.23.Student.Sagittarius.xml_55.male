I mean, would it be so bad to simply have a basic mood and then have minor fluctuations?  But no...like today, I want to just write a rant about how pissed off I am at the world, at God, at everything, even though I know that I have absolutely no reason to do so (thus, why I am not ;), whereas yesterday (or whenever that day was) I was content to relate "happier" things / events.  Maybe it has something to being at work at 9:30 on Saturday morning...or then maybe it's because I'm basically uphappy and don't know what will make me more joyful...or then maybe it's the crazy week I had finally catching up with me (sleep deprivation?  what's that?).  Anyway, I suppose (crack!) I should get (crack!) to work (crack! ouch!).
