Thus, political experts have agreed that a terrorist attack before the Presidential election would almost guarantee a victory for Bush.   "But Jim," you say. "Bush is tougher on terror than Kerry! Wouldn't the terrorists want to manipulate the people to vote for Kerry, so they have an easier time?"  If by "tougher on terror" you mean "vengance-obsessed and wildly striking out at any (or all) of the many camel-oriented countries," then I think I would agree that Bush is tougher on terror.  What one must realize is that the terrorists  know  that Bush would win if they conducted an election attack. Therefore, they must be acting in self-interest. Why would terrorists want Bush in the White House again? Simple. By being "tough" on terror, Bush is GOOD for terror. The military action he is so very fond of creates conditions that are breeding grounds for terrorists: bombed-out cities, dead family members, prison torture. By making the United States hated and feared worldwide, the President Bush has galvanized anti-Western terrorist movements, and made himself a clear enemy that the terrorists feel represents America.      info.link:  urlLink http://www.cat-scan.com/  how i died today:  urlLink struck by lightning 5 times   [Listening to: I'm Not Driving Anymore -  urlLink Rob Dougan  (04:33)]
