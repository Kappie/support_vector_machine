'i need a girl to ride, ride, ride, i need a girl to be my wife, i need a girl to be allll mine'  i called aisha at 11 last night.....she didnt pick up, probably cause of her damned curfew...lol..last time we talked at like 11 30.......4 day week! yay.... im not sure if i can work this wednesday...but i dont have much homework this week(im ecstatic! tonight the only homework i have is due thursday!)....but um i have to send my applications in so who knows if theyll let me stay...and its with different people so i dont know...ehh ill go for it. i like work.  my spanish essay is really rather depressing. i talk about how a few people have all the money and they dont care about anyone else and that as long as they continue to do this the environment will be screwed and the poor angry, life sucks. yes. i have tot alk about what i will be doing in 15 years. ill have to lie, God forbid he know my aspirations. lol   *dreams of bedding aisha in small mexican hut with bed made of DUCKIES(lol)*  i got a movie to wach with kimberly but she had gone to big bear..kimberly..all my lovers, dont worry, she said she wont date til shes married so she remains pure.
