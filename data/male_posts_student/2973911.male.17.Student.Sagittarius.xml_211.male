It's so fun it's stupid already.  Anyway, what I mean't was, why him?  What's so special about him?  And I hope you're not getting violent over having that person.  So, you liked me.  Big deal.  Everyone likes me until they actually try getting along and that's when most people find me a freak.  Or vice versa.  I guess these people can tolerate my madness.  But, like you said everyone is a little mad.  How Lewis Caroll of you!  Yeah, well anyone has the right to be gay, or empathic, or delirious, or book wormy.  I then have the right to be delusional on believing that the world isn't what it seems and work around that in life.  Come on people, some believe in Santa Clause eh?    Well, I'm not actually fictitiously delusional, I'm classifiable as philosophically paranoid.  Is there even such a term?  I don't care, I'll call myself that and that's it.  You see, I am paranoid about all posibilities: Secret Societies, Advanced Genetic programs, the Bible being true, and of course, The Matrix.  God knows, if there is such a being, whatever truths hide behind mortal perception, what actually is and if it is adverse or not.  We are all slaves of our own senses.  We all know only what we can receive as stimuli and yet believe anything we want.  "What you don't know won't hurt you" is the stupidest thing I've ever heard but it is my constant underlying phobia.  What if knowing the "truth" will only bring despair?    I love it when I talk about myself.  But what can I do?  It's the only valid thing I know: me.     urlLink http://www.phmguild.com/DROWLANG.htm  is the elf language translator.  Am I egotistical?
