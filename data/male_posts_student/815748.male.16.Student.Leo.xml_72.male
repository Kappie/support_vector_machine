It might be by next Thursday, though, especially with this thing that's happening tomorrow.  It's actually possible that I'm beginning to lean towards the other one, I don't know.  Jason Shen is so wise.  Apparently Ms. Heidlage knows of this novel with the last word being "Hunger" by someone named "Unger."  I think she got it wrong.  We finished "Au Revoir les Enfants" today.  I wrote down all of the...suggestive...language:  "And appeared naked as she was born."  "Each coupling the wildest fornication."  "She had the narrow passage of a Chinese girl."  "He probed her intimate depths and found she was a virgin pearl."  Hope you enjoyed those.
