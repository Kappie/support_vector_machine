TODAY you see was my  interview  at the PNE - yes ladies and germs i am gonna be a carny.... unfortunately i slept in and that sucked - so i was killing myself getting cleaned up and whatnot and then i realize i have NOO idea how to get there so i call up Translink and this robot starts asking me where i wanna go hahaha yes it was a robot and its soo cool because it could tell what i was saying - yeah t'was trippy my amigos... so anyways i race out of the house and then realize i forgot my resume so i run back.. print it out... and sprint out again... ahhh then i miss my first bus which was oh so lovely... anyhoo i make it downtown finally but i need to take some other one to get to the Pacific Colisseum so i hop on but it has to go through the lower east side and eww its creepy i saw bums fight. a couple prostitutes and a lot of ugly people... well i finally make it there and they seat me at this table full of shy shy shy strangers so im all "HEY GUYS WHATS UP" and they all mumble something back so i was all.. 'YEEEAAHHH...... YOURE COOL' and THEN okay i have nothing against philipinos but this one kept giving me attitude because he obviously know im gonna get the job even though i was like 50 mins late :p haha so hes being a bastard critisizing my ideas and such so i was about to tell him off but decided to be the better man... grrr..  i hope he gets sacked... aaaaaaanyways we go through the interview and its pretty depressing - everyones on such a low it was baaaaaaad... luckily I was there :-D bringing happiness and jow to everyone.... yeah im awesome...  so now thats over and im hungry -- oh i have a date tonight -- its with the same individual who we shan't name that stood me up - apparently there was some crisis... that was backup-able hahaha thats not a word.... and well w.e. if it happens it happens if it doesnt............... grr... you'll see me back on tonight bitching and whining...
