Then I got off and walked into a bathroom, and when I walked out again I found myself in a bull-ring with a bunch of other people, and there was a metal fence all the way around us. After a while several women came out and started singing. After they were done Max Cavalera came charging out screaming really loudly and people were chasing him, causing him to skip parts of his lyrics. Then I saw someone in the crowd who I hate from high school and I bit him. It caused my tooth to snap in two and one half was hanging from my gum. I shown my cousin (I dunno why he was there), and he pulled it out and we were laughing. Then I woke up. I really wanna know what it meant.
