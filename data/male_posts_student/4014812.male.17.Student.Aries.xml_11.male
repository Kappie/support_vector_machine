Talked to Audra for a little while about my whole "insecurity" issue... trying to work on that.. cuz that seems to be what is not helping me out lol.. steph said that and so did audra so... ima work on that...  Yeah anyway... pretty much the whole day i just kinda sat around waiting for 6 to come around so me James and Dimitri could go swimming. Ashley and Jessi were there.. but we didnt talk to em.. i dont like Jessi much.. and i really wasnt in the mood to talk to Ashley... but anyway.. yeah we went swimming and had fun :D... came home... watched a little bit of TV... then played Heres Come The Pain for a while until i finally fell asleep.
