He'll loosen up in a bit hopefully.  Bruce sucked. I didnt like them at all. The lead singer went barefoot which I found odd.  Blueprint 76 was great, but still no movement by the crowd due to the low amount of people there. There was a better turnout at the Knights of Colombus and American Legion shows I have been to with groups of not well known local bands playing. I would say about 50 or so people showed. Royce reminded me of someone as he flailed about on the stage and ran about. Jay, yes, he reminded me of the lead singer of the Suicide Machines. Looks like he took some style with him. I got a shirt, and that came with a cd, and i also got their new cd. I really like "1984". There cd was good and so were they, but I wish more people came so it would be more suitable to mosh, some of their songs seemed perfect for it, and me and marty were itching to run around.  If you guys go to the  urlLink Blueprint 76  site, it will lead you to a list of where you can buy their new cd, which is really good.  All in all, I guess it was worth it cause I got a killer cd and got to experience them live and see 9miles2go.
