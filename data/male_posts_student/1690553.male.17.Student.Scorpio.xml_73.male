First in place after Malaysia is UK - maybe it just those Malaysians staying abroad like  urlLink Sang Kelate ,  urlLink Idlan Zakaria   Doc Borhan. Get to know a new blog friend today from Singapore -  urlLink Ruqayyah  a.k.a  urlLink Akai . She landed on my page through my tag-board posting at  urlLink eNovel  and I noticed her by her posting at Azra's blog requesting to add a link to her blog. Chatted with her through MSN Messenger before iftar.  By the way, all links directing to my school site is dead. We are on the process of moving the site. Maybe it will be up and running when the school opens in January.  - Sound of  It's Easier to Run  by  Linkin Park  -
