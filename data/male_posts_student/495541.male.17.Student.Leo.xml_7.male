While walking home, I always notice the cars that pass me by and today a car stopped and a guy got out, except the guy in the car behind him didn't stop and went to the right of him.  I'm guessing it was pretty close because the guy stopped backed up and started yelling obscenities out the window, though I don't believe the guy heard him.  I thought there might be a fight or something.  The guys in the car were pretty mad.  Kind of weird to witness, but not as weird as seeing an accient.  I saw one a few months ago.  This morning, I went in early to do some lifting.  Fontana and my Dad talked a while last night about this stuff.  I'm supposed to be in the weight room all the time and what not.  Basically saying, if you want to relax, go out for a spring sport.  Coaches don't know when to go away.  I can understand over the summer or before the season but right after the season's over?  I would expect at least a month or so to just relax.  Apparently they want us to get in there and get 'the edge' on the competition.  Meanwhile, I get about 6 hours of sleep because they want us in there at the crack of dawn.  I go to bed at about ten but I never fall asleep until about 11:30 or most of the time later.  Also, I offen wake up at 4 for no reason.  An odd thing it is.  'Til later.
