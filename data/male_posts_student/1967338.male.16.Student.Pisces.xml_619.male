Theofficial title of Episode III is Revenge of the Sith. Just asanybody could have guessed in 1983. Except us, I guess,'cause we weren't born. But although it's an obvious choice, it's obvious because it's good. Certainly better than a title like "Attack of the Clones." So the sequence of movies (in movietime chronology): The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi. Hee. Little things like this give me such pleasure.  Marten and I have communication difficulties in talking about the movies, because he insists on referring to realtime chronology, and I keep referring to movietime. So I'll say Luke looks like Anakin in that shot, and he says no, Anakin looks like Luke. It's frustrating. Almost like the werewolf thing.  Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!
