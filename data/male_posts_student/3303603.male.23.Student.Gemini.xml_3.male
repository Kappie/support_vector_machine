Yet, a lot of people are obese. I guess they should be thankful to themselves for working out. Everywhere I see, food products are either labeled `fat-free' or `no-fat' and the like. Then what would explain the obesity?  Anyway, working out is a Good Thing. It gives me a much needed break from my sedentary lifestyle.
