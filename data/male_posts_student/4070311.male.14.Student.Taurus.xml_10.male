Alright... i Was SupPose to WakE up At 7am for mY tuition at dhoby Ghaut at 9am ... but Woke up at 8.20~! i was late ! i sms-ed my tuition teacher and told him that i wasn't able to make it for the tuition... so, i went to bathe lor.... after bathing, i called yi heng to find out bout wad time to meet in church and stuff... so i am to reach church by 9.00 for Bible study.... followed by the Main Service in the sanctuary. btw ... my church ish Bethesda Cathedral .... daa big and white Church tt looks like a Castle! lolx ... back to my story ... Before mAin servIce startEd, We SaNg WoRship Songs like, " one way, Days of Elijah and many many more songs " These songs realli made me think about God and His purpose of bringing me into this Earth that we are in. by The wAy, in the weeks Bulletin, there was this  sign-[NO GOSSIPING] that struck me. it was like... i have been gossiping about people these few days! Is God trying to speak to me? so, I have decided that since God doesn't want us to gossip about other people... why not juz follow his commands? So guys ... if u see me gossiping hor.... remind me not to gossip alright? wahaha. aNd During tHe main service, Pastor talked about the Healing annoiting upon our church. That during the time of Jesus, Jesus sent 12 people to went out and heal everyone that is blind, sick, crippled and many more. etc. aT tHe eNd of the mAin service, Pastor called out for those hu has pain in the leg for healing... and surprisingly, there was a lot of people with pain in the leg ! there was like 15 of them! And after Pastor prayed, almost one third of them was healed! PRAISE THE LORD! After main service, Auntie Hwee Phen brought us out for lunch at cafe cartel .... was raining den. ... so the atmosphere wasn't there. =( . But, It was still a lunch that i enjoyed. =) ... During youth service, We split up into classes to ask if we had any difficulties while trying to share Christ with our friends... although i did not hav any qns, i learnt alot from there... After youth service ended, it was Gordon's audition for music ministry as a DruMmer ! keWlz coolz... haahx ... he played not bad..... But he was so shy that he wanted everyone to go out of the room except himself and timothy cheng. wahahax .... but .... we crawled back into the room to see him play! wahahahax... the best part was when we open the door soo big and he did not even notice the door open. lolx .... Anyway , something sad happened after that. its better that i don't tell about it. soMething that is not associated to me.... but i veh kaypo ... lolx..... wahh! i write until sooo long! wahaha.... okiex .... think that i'll stop till here. Continue tml.   bUhbYeZ!~   God loves all of us inspite of how bad and evil we are.   tAke cAre ~
