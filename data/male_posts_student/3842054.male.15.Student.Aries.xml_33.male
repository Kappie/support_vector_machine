We just did review. TV Pro was awesome again, we went over script format and clues. Lunch was really pleasent except all the little juveniles running around. Algebra, we still have a sub, and im like the smartest one in the class again... Chemistry sucks, its boring, i want to kill myself. Went to Starbucks with Ryan after school cuz we were taking the 4 oclock train. Hung out with Kelsey and Emily and went to Katies.  The Juliana Theory  Now I'm at Katies, spending the night for four days while my parents are in New York. Itll be cool. I finally met the Ross's friend Joe... awesome dude. Dan made some icons for everybody and they were awesome. Im really excited now, so I just wanted to make a little post so i feel good. Well, lyrics lyrics...  Something Corporate Me and the Moon  It's a good year for a murder she's praying to jesus, she's pulling the trigger there's no tears, cause he's not here she washes her hands, and she fixes the dinner but soon they'll be coming to rush her away no one's so sure if her crime had a reason reasons like seasons they constantly change and the seasons of last year like reasons have floated away away with this spilt milk away with this dirty dish water, away seventeen years, and all that he gave was a daughter "it's me and the moon," she says i got no trouble with that but i am a butterfly, you wouldn't let me die"it's me and the moon," she says and it's over, but it just started the blood stained the carpether heart like a crystal she's lucid and departed a life left behind, she can find in her mind gone away away with these nightmares away with suburbia shake down away you marry a role and you give up your soul til you break down"it's me and the moon," she says "i got no trouble with that, but i am a butterfly, you wouldn't let me die" "it's me and the moon," she saysbut what do you say we go for a ride? what do you say we get high? but i'm so tired of days that feel like the night "it's me and the moon," she says and i got no trouble with that, but i am a butterfly, you wouldn't let me die i am a butterfly, i am a butterfly, i am a butterfly   I had that song stuck in my head the whole day. Great song. Kinda know whats it means, but i dont have the energy to explain. Goodnight.
