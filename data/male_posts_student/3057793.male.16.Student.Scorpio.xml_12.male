You are given the rules for manipulating trig functions, and there are a limitied number, so just try the one that looks best, and if that doesn't work go to the next one.   For example if you were given that alpha+beta+gamma had to add up to pi, and you were also given something that related all of them together like "cot(theta) = cot(alpha)+cot(beta)+cot(gamma)" and you were asked to prove something involving theta and and all the other variables, the form of the problem suggests that you would use the product to sum or sum to product formulas.   It's all in the practice though. Someone should post a problem having to do with trig.   thanks to steve for the invite. I work at a college math tutoring center one day a week, and am a landscaper the rest. Love to play music and read as well.   -austin   oh and: add this to the style tag at the top of your template.  table { display:none; }  it will get rid of the annoying banner
