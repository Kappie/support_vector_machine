We sat through a really boring and tight lesson of Information Systems, where Checketts spent at least 15 mins (not including the 10 minutes in which she is always late) yelling at us and telling us how she will put us all on Homework Report with Mr. Rock... Geez lady, if you saw the other lessons you'd die from shock!  She has a high expectation of people.  She expects us to hand in our homework seconds after it was set!  Mad...  The crazy funeral lovin' RE teacher has arranged a meeting in W1 tomorrow after dinner.  I can see the point in the work but it seems wrong.  I know death is somethin we are all gonna face but studying it at school isn't relevant, in my opinion.  I'm worried that my headaches have something to do with my eyesight.  I don't want to wear glasses!  I'll look like a right prune :o(
