As usual will do the main points. Cause I still love you and don't want you to die of boredom.  Got up at 10...ish, took half an hour to get alive, so was in the shower at 10:30... until midday O_o. Longest-shower-ever-ever. Seriously, where most people have water marks on their fingers, I had bloody craters. Either meaning of bloody. Anyway, was hungry but it was lunchtime, and we had no readily cookable food so I went over Somerfields and got a Pot Noodle and some curry sauce. And this is the remarkable bit - I made my own curry! I even cooked the chicken (which we had before I went out, but it's horrible on its own, isn't it?), and it was lovely, and I'm still alive and not blind. Jon's verdict - good, but for an hour and a half's work, I'm not sure whether it would have been better just to have got a ready meal. Meh, satisfied though. I managed to make my own food rather than rely on Bird's Eye. The rhyme is mildly unintentional.  OK, then did trombone practice, which was actually better than usual. If I got pissed off with something I just left it (as a result of the last 2 days of practice getting so stressed that I was almost brought to tears by not being able to play the F# scale, which is surprisingly easy on the trombone i_i), and that didn't happen a lot. Even got the Db at the end of Saint-SaÃ«ns' Cavatine (which, for your information, is v. high)... admitedly not at double f but it's still impressive... I think... I'm sure 7 year old pre-grade-1 me would be floored from the shock.  Band practice started at 6 *shudders*. We had an extra guitarist, Marci, who is really good but threatened Tobin a little, I feel, so the guitar sound was a little odd, and a drummer who is immense at metal was Ben's stand-in, but as a result of this being ALL HE CAN BLOODY PLAY I'm sensing he's possibly the drummer I know that I'd consider to be the worst. At speed of fills and such, he's unrivalled (except perhaps by Adam), but he has no concept of appropriatness. In 'Peace', he did a metal beat. I ask you. He did a metal beat in Imagine. Die, die, die. Imagine all the people killing him for ruining one of the best songs in history. Gah. I can't work under these conditions. Try singing without mic over a drummer who drowns you out when you're full volume on the PA. Twit. To put it mildly.  Anyway, am in school tomorrow, so I don't have to rely on mum taking me in for my trombone lesson. She still has to pick me up, mind... I dunno, can do some revision for Physics and then hang about with Scott for a bit. Win-win.  Not sure why, but am missing Rhi...  Quote of the day: "You may say I'm a dreamer, But I'm not the only one. I hope someday you will join us; Then the world will live as one."  From Lennon's   Imagine (strangely, it isn't a metal song, Matt)   Love, Jon Roskilly
