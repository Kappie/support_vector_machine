We got given goody bags with pens and notepads and leaflets in, then we were told to wander round different subjects hearing about them. I first went to Drama out of sheer curiosity (I don't plan on taking it, but my subjects only filled 4 of the 5 sessions we had). That is, once I found it. Not much happened there other than some talking about the course and a video clip of drama in action - in this case a play about scizophrenia. Then I headed off to Physics, in which the teacher there lectured everyone about potential energy after the compulsory briefing of the parts of the subject. I also met Aaron there, and later Prital, friends that I haven't seen since primary school, which was interesting and rather a nice surprise.  Maths was next, and I had a teacher that viewed GCSE Maths as child's play and even A level Maths with Statistics as 'bottling it'. Then onto Computing for a boring yet informative lecture, and finally English literature. That was fun, as the English teacher spent the whole time showing us how minor punctuation in the language can strongly affect your interpretation of it. Examples being headlines of american newspapers (see if you can spot both the intended and possible meanings):   IRAQI HEAD SEEKS ARMS  PROSTITUES APPEAL TO POPE  TEACHERS STRIKE IDLE KIDS  Ah, the misunderstandings solved by the humble comma. :)  All in all a useful and fun morning out, can't wait to go now!
