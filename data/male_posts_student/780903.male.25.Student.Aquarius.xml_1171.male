Was able to borrow a laptop from a family friend to take back with me for exams this week (Thursday night I head back to NY for the summer) so I don't have to handwrite.  But computers, aren't they something.  Seems like everyone at Harvard has computer problems -- I'm not clear if that's the network's fault (everyone seems to get viruses) or what.  I have no idea.  But my borrowed computer stays off the network, and I'm e-mailing and blogging and all that jazz from the library for the week.  Which, actually, will probably make my studying at home a lot more productive, so I don't know that I'm complaining all that vociferously.  Anyway, enough about my computer!  On the Chinatown bus this evening, I was sitting next to a guy reading a book called "Survival in a Time of Crisis."  Frightening.  Not sure what crisis he was anticipating.  I saw "Avenue Q" on Broadway with a friend this afternoon before heading back up here.  Loyal readers will recall I wrote about the soundtrack a bunch of months back.  I liked the soundtrack.  The show was better than the soundtrack.  It was thoroughly entertaining.  Thoroughly.  I would say more, but if I say more, it will be all about me, and how seeing bad theater/TV/movies makes me feel better about my own skills and possibilities than seeing good theater/TV/movies.  But it's getting late, and I want to go watch Saturday Night Live so I can feel better about myself.
