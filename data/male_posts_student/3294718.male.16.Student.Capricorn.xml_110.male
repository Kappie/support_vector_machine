I'm stuck on  Stranger in a Strange Land . It's taken some turns that I don't like, but for some reason get me hooked even more on the book.  Here's a pleasant game: I'll list a bunch of quotes. You separate the ones from real thinkers and intelligent people from me. Not saying I'm not intelligent. Let me amend myself: Famous thinkers and intellects from my own thrown in there. Feel free to comment. I'll reveal all on... Friday.  "If man did not have worries, he would not be man. Worries are the foundation of humanity."  "Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it."  "The highest destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule."  "Beyond that frontier lay another. And beyond this lays yet another, and another. There will always be frontier, though it may change in appearance and temperament, for mankind to seek."  "Our country was founded on a distrust of government. Our founding fathers gave power to the people to keep an eye on government. So when politicians say, Trust me, they're actually being very un-American."  "He who trusts all falls victim to men; he who trusts none falls victim to himself."  "Doubt is part of all religion. All the religious thinkers were doubters."  To tell the truth, Hawkeye's poem hit me with religious sense. "The pain, it's running down my side;" Jesus pierced in the side. "I'll be slain only if it pleases Him." Especially the capital H, for God. The middle didn't really click with that theory, though.  That's all for tonight. I've got some Leno to watch.
