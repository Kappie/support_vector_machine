I found  urlLink this website  which has some early family info, and also the results of a Roald Schrock's DNA test, which I will quote in part (there's a lot of chemistry stuff in between):  "A large number of the families with the Schrock, Schrack, or Schrag surnames who currently live in the United States, have their origins in the mountain highlands of the Swiss canton of Bern, among early members of the Mennonite and Amish faiths, whose name was originally spelled as Schrag.  These Amish or Mennonite Schrag families all seem to have had their origins in the town of Wynigen, Switzerland, and specifically, in the hamlets of Loumberg and Mistelberg.  These ancestors left their homes because of persecution, which the combined forces of the established churches and the state unleashed against all non-conformist movements.  Many lived for some time in the Jura Mountains, in Alsace, and in parts of Germany, before emigrating to America, where they started to spell the family name as Schrock, Shrock, or Schrack.  Others migrated to the East, reaching Russia, where they lived for some time, before also coming to America, where they retained the original Schrag spelling.  My family's branch is descended from "Uli" (Ulrich) Schrag, who came to America in 1769, as part of the first wave of Amish immigration, settling in Somerset County, in the mountains of western Pennsylvania. His Schrock descendents were early settlers of LaGrange County, Indiana, where my paternal grandparents (no longer Amish) grew up. (More details to come!)  "My father, Roald A. Schrack, has been the pioneer, the first male of a Schrock/Schrack/Schrag lineage to come forward and have his Y chromosome DNA tested, so that we can gain a more in-depth picture of our history. We used the  testing company, Family Tree DNA.  The results of his test are exciting and unexpected. They show a genetic pattern that's found mainly in people of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern origins.  Of course, we are talking about origins, most likely, many thousands of years ago! But still -- how would that be possible?  Most of the ancestors of people who have this genetic type in Northern Europe, are thought to have migrated North after the end of the Ice Age, bringing agriculture during Neolithic times, from its beginnings in the Fertile Crescent, into the Mediterranean basin, and from there to the rest of Europe.  They would have been the first teachers of farming and animal husbandry to the hunting and gathering peoples.  Haplotypes similar to my father's seems to be especially common in Northern Italy.  So there are a few other possibilities specific to that region. One is that people of the early Etruscan civilization or of the great Roman Empire traveled northward across the Alps in their trading, political, or military activities.  Another possibility which fascinates me has to do with the many "heretical" movements that arose during the Middle Ages, such as the Albigensians (Cathars) and the Waldensians, who were violently persecuted.  These movements were centered in Southern France, and also grew very strong among the neighboring people of Northern Italy, especially Lombardy, and some of their members are known to have fled from the persecution by heading north over the Alps.  Amish and Mennonite historical sources such as the famous Martyrs Mirror trace the roots of their movement to that of the Waldensians.  "Will all the Schrock, Schrack and Schrag men turn out to share this same genetic type? Did our Schrag ancestors leave an ancient Mediterreanean homeland to settle the Alpine valleys? How will our DNA type compare with other Amish and Mennonite families, and other Swiss?  "Roald Schrack also seemed to nearly match with the Y-DNA of a fellow named Metni, from Lebanon, who is also in the Family Tree DNA database."
