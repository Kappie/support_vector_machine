Just some people call it that.  I stayed out at the skatepark with Lou til ten when I said I'd be back by half-nine, so my parents have decided to ban me from skatin saturday nights til I'm 16. Life can be bitch sometimes.  Oh well it's ok really, considering it's the only night I'.m free, or rather, used to be (put the sarcasm tags in there yourself) I'll put up some pics of Me n Lou in about half an hour but  i promised to take em down if she didn't like em... @Lou: Just like to say that it was  nice being with you tonight :-) That's wat true friends are for! xx  LoZ   http://thepencilcase.blogspot.com
