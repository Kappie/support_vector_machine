After discussin' things with my bud  Nick , we have decided on many plans to improve the impact that our blog has on the world.  The blog will be goin' through some dramatic changes that will enhance your blog-readin' pleasure, and maybe it may increase your dick size and sexual performance (should not be taken by those who have experienced heart attacks, cancer, or are allergic to the exposin' of...stuff.)!  We can't guarantee anythin' though folks!  Anyway here are some changes you can expect:            (1)   A picture says a thousand words!   Makin' their first appearance soon, pictures of  Nick and I  after every blog we post.  Not only will you able to see who we are, but you will also be able to tell what mood we are in!  Yes, we are goin' to take various pictures of our faces in depictin' different moods.  We'll try to make them as G-rated as possible, but please, like the government, don't take our promises seriously!       (2)   Logo-a-go-go!   Yep, we are also goin' to try and create a logo for our  Three Eye Witnesses  blog!  Not only will it add a personalized touch, but also add a sense of originality!  Isn't this great!?       (3)   A brand spankin' new quote every fuckin' week!   Thats right!  A new quote every week.  We will also try and put who created the quote, so that all the praise is attributed to them.   This week's  was: "Nobody's perfect.  I'm nobody, so I'm perfect!"   Thanks a lot to  Josh Davila , who was this week's qoute contributor.  Readers, send in your quotes, it may be your claim to fame!  Well, thats it for now.  Check out the  P.R.E. ,  Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare , and  Step by Step !  We've got shit to say and the balls (well  Elyse  hopefully doesn't have actual  "testicles"  but rather the  "balls"  or  "guts" ) to say it!
