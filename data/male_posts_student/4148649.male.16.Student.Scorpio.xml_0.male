The High Schools, I mean.  Universities, Colleges, those you can pick - you have limited selection in primary and secondary schools. I return to school on Monday.  I will start the day going to my homeroom, where I will receive a schedule (not a clue if I got what I requested and what I have when until that point) and a locker, along with many papares for myself and my parents to sign. I will then proceed to four other classes, going over rules, receiving textbooks, and such.  Most of these classes will be half of what the State standards require for a classroom that contains as many students as each of ours normally does.  As we approach lunch, the building will heat up.  Excepting the computer labs and library, and the trailer rooms, the building will be swelteringly hot in these nice 90 degree days.  Now, it gets hotter - when I lived in Texas, it got to be 112 regularly.  But when you're tryign to learn, and your arm sticks to your papers, and sweat is getting in your eyes, and you feel as if you are in a steam bath, tell me, how much education are you really getting?  From fifth period I head to my half hour lunch; an open lunch, since school is located right near downtown.  Amazingly, although smoking is restricted, students cluster in parking lots to do so.  In an alley which many of us stay clear of, the smell of pot is in the air.  At a drive-through place, people miraculously obtain beer and other things, although you don't see that as much at lunch - going to class drunk would of course cause problems.   After returning, talking to friends or girlfriend (If I have one currently) I might visit the bathroom, which may or may not smell like smoke, or maybe pot again, I go on to my other classes, in even more heat.  Also, a coupel of times a group at my school has approached the principal about beginning a school-recognized Bible Club.  We have been snubbed on both occasions.  Another thing,  there's the cafeteria - we get our food from the grade school down the street.  There isn't enough food or space for all of us, even if we wanted to eat there.   There are even more issues, such as the rumors about an affair between staff members, a manic librarian,  thieves, and expensive supplies (100+ dollar calculators??).  In response to all these issues?  Well, I was at the school for a Key Club event - they seem to have installed security cameras at all of the entrances. Touching.  We going to take pictures as the guy with a gun strolls in and shoots, or whatever?  Sounds effective.
