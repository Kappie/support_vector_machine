Band camp has started. whoohoo. Can't you tell I'm thrilled? But yeah, it's alright so far. Mason hasn't totally chewed me out yet and we start drill tomorrow night which should be awesome.       The leadership party was yesterday, it was a lot of fun and thanks to Mallory for putting it on. After that some of us band nerds went to see the Village. A mon avis, it is one of the best films I have ever seen. The way M. Night Shymalan had written that movie was amazing. I mean yeah, It isn't a thriller like Scream or Final Destination but it is very suspenseful like The Glass House. If you like a movie to mess with your head, you should go see it. But if you are looking for a movie that scares you the whole time and has no other basis but to disturb you from sleep, then don't go.    I talked to my ex-cavie friend Lee the other night. He said he was going to call Mason to see if he could possibly tech during band camp. We'll see. It would be really good to see him if he could.         anyways, that is enough for now.         au revoir, mes amis.
