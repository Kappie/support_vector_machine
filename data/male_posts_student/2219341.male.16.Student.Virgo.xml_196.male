Brandon called me and wanted to know if i wanted to play song...but i was really not in the mood.  i dont even think im gonna go.  im in a very strange mood.  like.   tired and blah.  oh well i guess i could just say blah.  that kinda covers the tired part.  i cant say life stinks cuz it really doesnt.  i am content in a way.  but then im restless too.  yeah well...anyways...that bout all i gots to say bout that.  im gonna run off and some of my mexican food!  oh and maybe some tortillas too!  havent made those in forever...
