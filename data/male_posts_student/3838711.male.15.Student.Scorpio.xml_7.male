Called up Whymobile at 10.10 am, they dont offer the door to door deliveryfrom 9 amto 9 pm anymore, since they're short of manpower, and the only available times are after 6 in the weekdays.. gotta take note next time... In the end decided to go collect the phone from them at the outlet, since its just above Zone X @ Atrium. Besides, he offered a further $5 cut on the price if I did so... lol, why not ?   Dilly-Dallied my time from 10.20 to 12 noon... played CS, listened to music, whatnot. Then decided to bath and then head on down to Atrium, since I'm meeting my friend there. Further broke the record of Steve's 86 from 2'47'162 to 2'46'366... haha... this is just too great... 1 sec down... And somehow, with that,I feel that my touch of IDAS is coming back soon.. didnt feel afraid of the oncoming corner, or that hairpin. Just tackle it with all my might. Yeah.. so I suppose I should be able to be back on form by the middle of next month... Hope the mood can stay away (at least for a while)while I'm driving out my best...   Headed to CTP to meet Yap and gang, played ID from 3 to about 7... didnt really care too much, the mood started to kick in, but its kinda mild. Felt kinda sian around 6.. didnt get too active after that. Followed Steve and Kun Long to Toa Payoh, had our dinner and headed to Toa Payoh Entertainment Centre to playlast few rounds of ID.. Irohazaka all the way... then it was a cab ride home.   Reached home at around 9.15, bathed, and felt kinda hungry after that. Had instant noodles cooking now.. gonna eatit once I finish this entry.   Hmm.... I guess thats about it for today, what else was there to be said ? I doubt it....
