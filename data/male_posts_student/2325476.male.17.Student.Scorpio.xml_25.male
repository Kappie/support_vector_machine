Ok, that being said, I had an incredible experience on the last night of my LA trip. First thing that hit me is that if you're willing to find a place,(and pay a fucking 20 dollar cover charge, which still blows my mind) there are places where you can do   whatever   your morals will let you get away with... to 15 year old girls. Needless to say i wasn't exactly in on the whole 15 year old softcore porn fest(i have a hard time forgiving myself if i call a friend after they've gone to sleep, so my morals dont leave much room for porking pre-pubescent girls). So yea, I'm at club One Seven(they dont let you call it Seventeen, lol) the other day... last night? I dunno my sense of time is fucked, and the 3 hour time difference dont help. Ok, so i get to club one seven maybe... 25 hours ago from right now, and i can tell rigth away it's not my scene. If you know me, you know I'm not the world's most extroverted person. So i'm pretty much chillin on the couches with my cousin. We see, for several hours, this one girl thats no more than 15 years old. She's wearing knee high black leather boots, fishnet stockings, a miniskirt that's maybe... 6 inches long, 7 at the most, and a spaghetti strap shirt that shows her sparkley black bra off. So at first shes just dancing around alone, and everytime she goes down everyone can see her panties, which is kinda sick considering she's early 15 year old. Anyway, after an hour or so, this guy that looked older than me comes up and starts freaking with her, which in itself isn't so bad. then, after a little more time, this guy she's dancing with, that she's obviously  JUST   met starts rubbing his hands all over her crotch(or, if you're grant, then all over her groin ;) )! I mean, some of the stuff this girl and guy were doing could be considered softcore porn. The other thing that struck me about the club, is how sad it is that a lot of the kids here are trying to find meaning in that kind of stuff. I mean, far be it from me to tell ppl what they should do with their lives, but i think it's kind of sad that people are trying to find meaning in pseudo-sex(well, maybe not pseudo) with strangers. I dunno, maybe there's nothing wrong with that, but it strikes me as more of a problem than consumerism.   In fact. I love consumerism, i love capitalism, i love stores ripping people off to provide me products that i enjoy, and dont really need. I realized that as I was playing the Gamecube i bought on friday. I was halfway thinking of participating in buy nothing day, but the Gamecube came with 4 of the 6 Zelda games, including the two original NES games, unaltered. As it stands theres an upper, middle, and lower class. If it weren't for people buying shit and driving our economy, there'd just be a lower class. Quick question, which is the lesser of two evils, some people being poor, or all people being poor?   Wow, WHY THE FUCK AM I AWAKE?!!?!?!?! I'm gonna go get my 6 hours of sleep for tomorrow. I'm gonna be dead at track practice...
