As you will no doubt be aware from reading  urlLink Megatrobe's Blog  and  urlLink Teradud's Blog , I and my friends visited the Tate Modern recently. We wandered around 3 floors, and I saw 2 things I liked. One was 'International Klein Blue', a square of a shade of blue invented by somebody Klein. It does not purport to be art. The other was a big metal spider-thing.   Now, the main problem I have with modern art is, although it carries a message, it is appallingly communicated. For example, there was a room full of mannequins picking up 'litter' of little cut-outs of people, and recycling them. It showed how the Thatcher Government sacrificed people in favour of the economy. Fair enough. But what is wrong with the artist writing a short essay, essentially saying just that? It's such a waste of resources! And although most of the art, when analysed, shows a deep message, you do have to think about it. And in many cases it could be ANY message. Ones that eluded my analysis were:     Two big towers, that changed colours.     An air-conditioning unit. It was art. Next to it, on the floor, was a  real  air unit. It wasn't art. Hmm.     A room full of pictures of squares, vaguely painted.     A video of a corkscrew being slowly moved about in front of a cheesegrater. I've no idea either.     A video of a bowl of rotting fruit. I had one on my old CD encyclopaedia, but it wasn't art, for some reason.      The list goes on. I suspect these modern artists think an idea up, then let other people analyse it.
