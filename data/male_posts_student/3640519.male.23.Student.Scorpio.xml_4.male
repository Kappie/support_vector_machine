Joblessness is a state where you find yourself stranded with nothing to do. This state is pretty similar to one of those uncomfortable nights where you deperately want to sleep but just can't. You toss, turn , groan, heave  to no avail. The most discomforting aspect is that your conscience pricks you that your time is draining away. You can spend your time at IIT  wastefully, and still end up with a decent job. But  joblessness is a state of mind where you are in perpetual discomfort. you procrastinate. You skive. You know you'll end up in muck. But when joblessness strikes nothing can save you. Your thoughts wander off and it's takes a great deal of effort to herd them back into the narrow confines of academic pursuit.  And today I feel one such bout has overcome me. I have typed enough.  Our placements start in July. May God give me a good job and keep joblessness away.
