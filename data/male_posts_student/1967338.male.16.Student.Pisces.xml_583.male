I apparently, I just have a slightly large, but fully functioning and cyst-free thyroid. So yay! Also, I don't have TB. It's all good news here.  Sophia, you've made me sad. Come on, my life is pretty boring too, I just talk about it anyway. I mean, let's look at this objectively: my last post was about Discworld books and my thyroid. Please.  Anyway, my dad says that if our DSL isn't up very soon we're getting cable internet, just to spite the dsl people. But that would be super inconvenient really, because in order to afford it we'd have to get rid of AOL, and I've already filled out all my college stuff with my AOL account, and we'd have to download AIM and everything. That's bad.  I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!
