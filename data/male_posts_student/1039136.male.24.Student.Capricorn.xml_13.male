I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just assholes.  I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.  I've learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better have a big weenie or huge boobs.  I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think.  I've learned that you can keep puking long after you think you're finished.  I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities.   I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away.
