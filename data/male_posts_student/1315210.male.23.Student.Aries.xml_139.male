ENGINE STALL~!!!!!!! and nvm that, she stops and STALLS 100m away from the traffic at the light..............so she restarts the car and tries to move off again.....but the car stalls AGAIN~!!!! go figure...................  ok.....so ive said abit more than "not much"..........who cares........it's my blog..........but to be fair to the ladies, i think there are some who make really good drivers..........just that ive not met any yet.............and not all are of the type ive mentioned above...........
