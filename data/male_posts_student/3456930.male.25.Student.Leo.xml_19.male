Haven't seen him since... about... 1999? 2000? A while anyways. It was really good to catch up with him. He also dropped off some books I lent him so now I can re-read the Wheel of Time series and finally read books 9 and 10.  What else happened today? Hmmm... not a lot. Just worked and then came home and rubbed in the All Blacks' loss to the Wallabies to my flatmate, Matt. He's a Kiwi so it was funny seeing him getting all psycho during the game and jumping around and everything. And then they lost. LOL. Yes, much fun was had by all.  Deciding on whether I should sell all my stuff before I leave for the UK. Like my bed, bookshelf, fridge, lounges etc etc etc... wondering if I'd get much money for them. See what happens closer to the day. If I don't I'll have to decide on what to do with them. Like where will I store it all? What can I palm off to my parents/friends etc.  Have noticed that my house gets REALLY dusty REALLY quickly. Like, stupidly dusty.  Anyways, I'm off to read for a while.   Lowman X, out.
