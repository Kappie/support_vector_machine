I'm about to pick up the DAT machine from the tech. guy - apparently, we have  five  DAT machines, but only  two  are working. Both of these were booked out all weekend, and one of them was apparently being used by teh tech guy himself. That's just not on, folks - this equipment should be primarily for  student  use only, not for his own shenanegains  >=(
