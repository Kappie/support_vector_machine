It appears as if my plans to join the track team this summer have been put on hold. In July I'm taking a math college course that I got a scholarship for. At the same time, I will probably be taking SAT Math/English prep courses. So that kinda blows. On the bright side, the college course is free, the credits can be transferred and it only lasts 3 weeks, so that's 15 days of class (each session is 3.5 hours long). The SAT courses are 2 hours long, I think, and they last the whole summer, but it's only once per week.   Anyway this year was tough, but I finished off with a 98.6 average. My parents are going to atlantic city tomorrow, so I get the house to myself. Sounds good, doesn't it? Well...not really. While my parents are away, I'll be babysitting my 7 year-old brother...so much for the beer and the bitches.   I was watching the European Championship in Soccer today. I don't normally keep up with sports on TV but I do keep up with major games in soccer. Wow impressive game. It was the Quarter-finals, I think... Holland Vs. Sweden. Incase you're wondering, Holland won by a penalty shot. It was a pretty amazing game. Which brings a question to mind. How do so many Americans find (American)football and baseball so fasinating? A soccer game is intense, people constantly running back and forth, the whole tide of the game could change with one shot. People literally pray and cry in the stands during a soccer game. In american football or baseball, the guys are standing around half the time. Especially in baseball, half the time all you see is te guy getting ready to bat. Come on! Where's the suspense? Where's the drama?, Wheres the action? .....boring! It doesn't make sense to me how soccer is the major sport in every other country in the world except America. But oh well, to each his own I guess.
