I wanna get back, to my city by the bay! ohhh oh oh ohhh... errr, nevermind... thats a Journey rip... Marshall is about as landlocked as you can get.  Well, It's lame-er, (than Marshall,) but my fellowes are there.  I walked into a womens underwear store, and no one looked at me wierd! (Im a guy...)  I went there and bought a bottle of nail polish, and went to claires, and bought an afeminate choker, and noone even raised an eyebrow.  Thats tolerance for you.  To all the nice people in the world, thank you, for accepting people who do things a little on the wierd side... like femme guys, or butch girls, they aren't gay, and if they were? who cares! so thanks for making my life esier, and to everyone who looks at me or anyone with hatefull prejudice, I can't say that some mythos of a god will teach you a lesson in the afterlife, but maybe I can teach you one now.....
