I woke up this morning, and went back to sleep... and then I didn't wake up until almost noon.  Something I haven't done in a LONG time.  I usually wake up around nine o'clock, and get out of bed to at least feel productive.  But I guess my body was trying to tell me something, trying to tell me that I went from zero to sixty in 0.34 seconds, and that it wasn't quite ready for that.  I'm gearing up for a really busy two weeks, so I think that makes me enjoy the regular lazy days a little better, and not feel like I HAVE to have something to do.  It's nice to have stuff to do, but it's more fun to have people to do stuff with!  Ah, Thank God for today!
