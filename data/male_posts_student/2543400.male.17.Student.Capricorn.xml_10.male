Man the whole Ponicco wearing thongs part, that was great. Laughed my ass off! And Puss in Boots, he's so cute,  man I feel like a lil girl right now 8-), but it was funny.  It was a great sequel better then the Matrix sequels that made no sense. Just a lot of fucked up shit. But I recomend everyone to see this movie, so what you waiting for...go see it, now! I order you! :)
