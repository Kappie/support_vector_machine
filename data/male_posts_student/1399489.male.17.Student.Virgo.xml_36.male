Engineering camp: engineering camp was soo cool me and bryndan went and we thought it was gonna be like school, but we got to have fun the whole time well except when were were learning about really confusing or boring stuff.  we did some really cool stuff though like simulations and then we did fun stuff like played in the mud and went bowling and swimming and went on a boat in the mississippi.  the last night was the best everybody stayed up till about 5 in the morn and we watched movies and stuff.  lol old school was a great movie if u havent seen it, u  need to.   there were some really cool ppl too!  i was glad to get back from engineering camp though i missed everybody here and i missed being able ot sleep on a bed instead of an army cot which wasnt to confortable.   when i got home i started working out for football and working again.  i slaved away tuesday through friday and then happily got my check on friday and cashed it so i could spend it all in dc.  then i packed all day on saturday and went to tell alot of ppl goodbye before i left then me and liz were off on our plane to dc.   DC when we got there it really sucked.  we waited at the airport for 4 hours for the shuttle to come pick us up and it never came. it wasnt as bad it sounds thought b/c there were about 50 other ppl waiting also so i was meeting ppl while i was there.  after sitting there that long me and 6 other ppl that i had just met decided we would get a minivan taxi to bring us to the hotel so we found a cool driver named cj and we loaded up 7 ppl and all their stuff and went off on our 1 hr drive to the hotel.  i met 3 ppl that i became good friends with on the taxi ride to the hotel.  we got there and got our rooms and everything and i was staying with 2 cool guys but i got there last so lucky me got the rollaway bed the whole time.  it was better than an army cot though.   throught the week i kept mettin lots of moreppl and we had speakers and went and toured the city and i even got to meet some goverment ppl it was cool.  they let us in places that regular tourists ppl dont get to go.  ohh our bus .. the first 2 days it was hell .. literaly.   the air was broke and inside out bus was hotter than outside and it was 95 outside. it was insane but then they got us a new bus and we got to watch the goonies! ohh yeah and we got to go to sixflags and a oriles baseball game!  both of those were soo much fun!  we had 2 dances also they were great too.  i prettymuch learned how to do a body roll lol.  then the end of the camp was commin close it was the last dance and i was dancing with katie who i met about 1/2 way thought the camp she was soo cool i miss her!  she lives in AL. but ne way that last night was soo great i'll always remember it and all my friends from NYLC, too many to name right here. on the day when everybody was leaving there tons of people crying.  katie was crying and then me and lizzy ended up crying on the bus to the airport (jeans, orange shirts, and tears) i didnt want to leave all my friends they were soo great.  i got home and i was all depressed but then bryndan and ben spent the night and they cheered me up some and then on the 4th i shot tons of fireworks and blew lots of stuff up and bryndan, ben, patrick, and brad all spent the night.  it was great fun! then today i didnt wake up till 12 30 or so.  everybody left and then i went over to erins for 2 1/2 hours and i showed her all the pictures and stuff and told her lots of stories then i went to church.  ohh yeah and then i called katie from NYLC and we talked for 45 min or so and then lizzy came over and i showed her my pictures too.. she wasupset that she ddidnt get hers back yet.   I hope i didnt bore everyone with that long entry but i figured i would catch everyone up with my life.  I hope urs is going great! peace
