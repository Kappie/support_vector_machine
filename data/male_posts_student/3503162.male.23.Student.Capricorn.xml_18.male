Got to uni at 8am, nothing was opened so that sucked, had to amuse myself for one hour........  Meeting was nothing special. Can't say anything exciting because that would be lying wouldn't it :P  Had to submit my diary for my clinical placement for the past 5 weeks. Yes a diary out of all things I had to submit.
