Those who did not complete this amount would be punished by not attaining their hard earned high school diploma. Service even became a class that usually met once a week, keeping stressed and busy seniors somewhere useless and unproductive. At the end of the year, to fully complete the service project, we had to write a service essay depicting our feelings about service and what we learned because of it. I could have very easily bullshitted the whole thing saying things like, " Service is a growing experience, one that should be taken by all youth. Blah Blah Blah" However, I didn't. I vented and aired my opinon and sent this exact essay to my service teacher.    Yet Another Bright and Cheery Service Essay    Upon first hearing the words service this year I cringed. I remembered junior year when we were forced to do fifteen hours of grueling service. It seemed as if Fordham Prep had developed the service program to provide free labor not only for their own social events but also for others in order to glorify its own reputation. Now with a ridiculous seventy hours to fill, the task seemed to be a way for the Prep to entrap seniors with busy time, preventing them from doing anything truly productive. Nonetheless, I did go into this service project with an open mind having an inkling of hope that this would be a fruitful experience for me. How wrong I would be.   When choosing a service project I was very picky. I did not want to serve at a nursing home because I had done that before for my elementary school. I can still remember the sad, pale looks of what were once people but had now become the living dead. Some say that you can’t see death but I remember seeing it well. All I had to do was look into one room and see a frail old body laying comatose on the mattress. Walking down the hall I could smell the stench of not urine or feces, but what surprisingly only could have been dead skin cells; I could smell them dying.   To prevent exposing myself to this nightmare again I chose the logical route and decided to do service with young people. I remembered how happy when I was younger I was , so full of energy and excitement. These children would be much less depressing than the cadavers that filled the nursing home. I provided my voluntary service to Visitation Elementary School in the Bronx and soon my optimism would be crushed. I looked out to the crowd of busy little bodies and had my memory jolted ; elementary school was horrible! I remember toiling away my energy hoping for the time to pass and waiting for the sweet embrace of a Saturday. Let alone the painful stay they had to endure for eight hours, this was after school which meant even more work. Yes, I took great pity on them. I wanted to scream, yell, and free them all from this penitentiary. I wanted to tell them that nothing that they were doing now would be of importance later on. That they were only separating themselves in a cruel social Darwinist fashion as children! Children for God’s sake! If they are unsuccessful in their time here they will be deemed as failures and then be treated like failures for the rest of their lives. They will go on, continuing the cycle of degradation to a poor high school, poor college, if any, and then a low-income job with long hours until their offspring can hopefully become deemed as “bright” or “smart” and break the vicious chain. If not, another futureless victim is thrown out into the spoils of the world.   The school system is not a means of education but only an advanced babysitting center where the “good” are separated from the “bad”. Then something dawned on me. I realized my time at the prep was almost no different from theirs. I asked myself, how free am I? Not free at all if I was forced to do this “voluntary” labor. Then I went on to ponder the college institution, will I be able to break the bondage by attending a college or university? I reminded myself of working arduously over silly, trivial papers and taking the SAT’s in order to separate myself from the rest and be deemed acceptable to colleges. I was attempting to please and find acceptance from people I never met before, what the fuck was I thinking?(This part has been added, im not gonna curse in a paper if I hope to pass) Came to the revelation that, like everyone else, I was just comforming to the social structure that our nation applies by. This is where I realized that I will never be free of bondage; that most will be bound to this status structure. This was the only positive that I attained from service, this little scrap of depressing enlightenment.   If my feelings about service are not implicit then here is a summary. Service is bad. Service is bad when it is enforced for then it truly is not ,in the Jesuit definition, “service”. It should be correctly termed as slavery. At least this way, students will fully realize what they are being subjugated into. You might think that I want to do away with the service program. How wrong you would then be. I support it fully. With me now having completed my obligation to Fordham Prep’s Service Program I feel no compassion towards the underclassmen. A prep school is supposed to prepare students for college and life in general. By performing these acts of servitude, sadly, does. Sadly, it does.   Further note: I somehow got my diploma even with this rebellious "fuck you" essay to my school. Speak Out, Be Heard, Fight the Power, and all that other good stuff.
