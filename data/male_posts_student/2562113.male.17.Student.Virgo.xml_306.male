You know how when you go out and you dont come home until 2 in the morning?, and your parents are still up pacing back and forth, and when you get in they have both a sigh of relief and somthing to yell at you about? well i never really cared because i knew i was always ok, but now i know what they go through (at least concerning me.) it is one in the morning and my father isnt home yet. he at a bar with his friends across the river, and im very worried about him. im probably still going to sleep easy tonight, becuase in my gut i know hes ok, but i dont think he has ever come home this late. the gut feeling i have is beyond explanation. so, the next time you come home late and your parents want to yell at you about it, take it more as a compliment than as a question of your maturity: it shows that they care for you and would never want to see you hurt in any shape or form.
