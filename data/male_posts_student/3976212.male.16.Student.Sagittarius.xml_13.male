It's the toothbrush posse, I am on the bottem left (8th row). If you click it, you will get my nexus profile! Yeah I think it's cool but eh..Im boring. Also to my amazment-when I turned on my printer this morning out of nowhere it printed my resume perfectly-without it even being asked!! I thought I was going to have to buy and ink cartridge before I could hand out my resume..Now I just have to get it copied at the pharmacy in parksville a few time when I go with my dad to the truck rental place to pay the bill for when him and ryan went to powell river on saturday to get a whole bunch of our stuff! Besides that-my life basicly revolves around listening to music and chatting online (as you already might know! hehe). Life is getting boring lately-the wheather has been good. Well, I'm gonna go on another bike ride today after I go with my dad, and I have to eat breakfast and brush my teeth yet so i'm gonna go.
