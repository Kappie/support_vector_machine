The people I was playing with were my friends, but I didn't recognize any of them. More than one were apparently exchange students living with me. At one point I was driving in a car, a little drunk. I was pulled over. I hit my door lock with a hammer to try and open it, and wound up with a really bad bleeding nose. Went into Mcdonald's to get cleaned up...
