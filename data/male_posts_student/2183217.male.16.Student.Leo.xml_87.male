I decided to go heff the cat for a while... I started off..'GUMBY! WHERES THAT 50 BUCKS U OWE ME??"  when she didnt answer i tried to remind her about the good old days when we were sweethearts in college... doesnt that mean anything to her anymore? lmfao ... then my mom heard me from the other room and told me to stop annoying the cat... NOT UNTIL I GET MY MONEY BACK... I told her.. Also , snakes mom is locked in some closet and he's started anarchy in his house... He can no go to bed as late as he wants, and he has internet back.  Woo Ninja Style! Ninjas: 1 ... Gumby: -50$
