I needed to be there to sign the lease for my new place.       urlLink Me standing in my brand new (small) bedroom.    urlLink The view out the window.       urlLink Some other houses nearby.       urlLink What I think may have been the center of Fred's world on Sunday: Telegraph Ave.       urlLink Fred walking down Telegraph after a quick stop at Blondie's Pizza.       urlLink Me chillin' on the couch back at the house.    urlLink The staircase.       urlLink Me standing in the front door, about to leave.       urlLink Malcolm X Elementary on Ashby.   Yes, Berkeley has a school called Malcolm X Elementary.  It fits nicely with the subversive literature posted on nearly every telephone pole along Ashby.      urlLink A view of San Francisco from I-80.    urlLink Again.
