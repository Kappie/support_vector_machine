Maine is known for lobsters; lobster sucks. Philly is known for Cheesesteaks; cheesesteaks are amazingly good. In Maine you have signs that say, "Danger rugby chicks! Moose crossing;) in Philly you have signs that say, "no guns allowed in bank." Philly is an up and coming city full of character, characters, cool bars and restaurants, theaters, and art museums.  And, as we all know,  urlLink Maine is boring
