He knew there would be those men out there that would need help getting in touch with their emotional side.  That there would be rambunctious and rebellious men, that if they met the right woman, would calm down and be a great benefit to the world.  That there are men out there than need a fire lit inside them, and need someone to inspire a passion about something.  God made women soft, attractive, warm, smell nice, and blessed many with kindness, intelligence and a sense of humor.  Unfortunately for me, it seems like the ones that I meet with the intellegence are too smart to be interested in me... or I guess they think of me as a joke... a really bad joke.  So maybe they were meant as a torture device or punishment, as well.  Why can't I meet a woman who will love me?
