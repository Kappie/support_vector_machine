So then I got home and went to Ben's house, where we watch Batman: The Movie.....and I am here to say...that Batman: The Movie....is my favorite movie now.....It is so corny and unrealistic *laughs* it is funny just to laugh at!  Robin acts like priest and every time something happens he says "Holy (insert random word here)!" Here are some examples: "Holy Sardines!" "Holy Merlin's Magician" "Holy Polaris" and there were even some where we couldn't figure out what word he said....and in that movie there were so many ridiculous convieniences....oh man....you have to see Batman: The Movie....it is the best!  Here is how ridiculous one of the scenes were:  In this scene they are trying to figure out who is behind the attack on batman: Batman-"I was attacked by an exploding shark...shark...fish....the penguin!" Robin-"and it happened in the sea...sea...c....c is the first letter of Cat Woman" (Geez!  How did Robin deduct that??) (uhm...they somehow threw the joker into all of this...i forget how they connected him into it) Sheriff-"Man...it's like they threw all this together like a riddle....riddle...er.....The Riddler!"   *Laughs* oh man...here is another:  In this scene Robin and Batman are stuck to a bouy, with a torpedo from the penguins sub heading towards them: *explosion* *villains prance around in celebration* Penguin- "lets see the fruits of our work...." *peers into periscope* "what?? they are gone?" (switches to scene with batman and robin riding away in boat) Robin-"Boy, we sure got lucky..." Batman-"Yes, good thing that porpouise got in the way of that torpedo...he did a very noble thing to give his life for us...." Ok...first of all...why the hell would a porpouise run into a torpedo... and second of all how did you escape from the bouy???  Alright here is another scene where they are trying to figure out one of the riddlers riddles: Batman-"read these riddles robin...and see if you can deduce what i thought when i read them." Robin-"What does a turkey do when it flys upside down?....It gobbles up!" (I personally don't understand that one...) Batman-"Good! and the next one!" Robin-"what weighs six pounds, lives in a tree, and is very dangerous?  A sparrow with a machine gun!" (I swear to god that is what Robin said.....a sparrow...with a machine gun.....how..?....how did he..?....nevermind...) Batman-"now put the two together" Robin-"gobbles up....a sparrow.....what gobbles up a sparrow? a cat!...Catwoman!"  So there is a nice preview for you of the loads of fun Batman the movie is....please watch it...you will laugh....i didn't even mention some of the really funny stuff....well...I think I am done...adios!  "SOS...we need help...SOS....we need help" The Suicide Machines (love this band!)
