Kyray kept going on about how it sucked and how the Dementors looked like umbrellas...XD. But whatever. I'll see it eventually. My fangirlishness depends on it. XD  On another note, I really miss Ali. I haven't been able to talk to her since yesterday night, and she's the only thing I've been thinking about all day..either I'm worrying about what's happening with her, or I'm thinking of all the romantic things I want to do with her...either way, I couldn't get her out of my mind. Mary suggests that I may indeed be in love with Ali...hmm..only time will tell on this case.
