There were probably a total of 3 occupied campsites in the entire park which made for a very people quiet place to be.  It was really just the nearby road and the forest sounds.  I get there with a headache, which I am totally upset about, but I try to drink away, while at the same time occupying my mind with the duty of Fire Chief, protector of the Flame.  Man was that Fire raging.  I absolutely love camp fires, everything about them, the smell of the smoke, the heat hitting your face while the cold wind slices up the back of your coat.
