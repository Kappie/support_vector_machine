Get out of the bathroom so we can go downstairs." i hope for her sake she has a nice figure......  somehow i just feel that this would be perfect for a tv reality series, but not for the newspaper............i would think the journalist would have the sense to do abit of content filtering........this paper will be sold outside of our country......and it doesnt reflect well on our pple's image.........  and from that to the stupid things pple do during a crisis..........one money changer grabbed 2 things when he evacuated a nearby building...........his handphone...........and his cordless phone................duh~!!!!!! you already grabbed your handphone rite? y would u need a cordless phone?!?! and never mind that, how would u expect your cordless phone to work that far out from your store?!?!?! if u had the time to grab things, wouldnt it first be your id stuff and then your handphone? y a cordless phone??!  oh i know...........he must have watched too many reruns of miss singapore universe 2001..........in case of an emergency, bring your handphone so u can use it's radiation to attract attention for help..........and he probably thought the cordless phone may help boost the strength of the radiation, OR allow him to call and console himself..............for wat, i dunno.......nonsensical pple do nonsensical things..................
