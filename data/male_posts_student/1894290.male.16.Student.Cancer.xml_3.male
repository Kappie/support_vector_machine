He was so cute. I went around town to try and find this movie, but luckily I finally went to Blockbuster and rented it. I'm definetely going to buy this. I also bought The Day After Tomorrow soundtrack. I haven't listened to all of it, but the songs I have listened to are really good. Kinda remind me of the movie...lol. Tomorrow evening I leave to go to my aunts wedding. So I won't be updating as much as I would like.
