I was looking on the internet yesterday for chess rules, because I noticed when I play people, hardly anyone knows where to really put the Queen, and I wanted to show them that I'm right. Turns out, I was right because the light Queen goes on the light space, and the dark Queen goes on the dark space. I guess I showed those punks.  The interesting thing though is that there was a rule I wasn't aware about. It's called "En Passat" and it has to do with Pawns. What the rule is is that if a Pawn moved 2 spaces forward on its first move, and your Pawn is next to it, then you can capture the Pawn by moving it behind the Pawn that moved 2 spaces. You can only do this the turn immediately following the first Pawn's movement though.     The dot is where the black Pawn can go to capture that jerk the white Pawn for his 2 space first turn movement. That'll show those crackers.
