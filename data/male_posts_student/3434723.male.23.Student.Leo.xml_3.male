But that still leaves me wondering what she thinks of me.... Maybe she considers me a friend. I sure hope so..... By the way, get a load of this. I got this from a site. 30 worst pickup lines.   - I'm here. What were your other two wishes?  - Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?  - Nice dress. Can I talk you out of it?  - That dress would look great - on my bedroom floor.  - I may not be Fred Flintstone but I could make your Bedrock  - I seem to have lost my telephone number, may I borrow yours?  - Get your coat, you've pulled.  - Here's 20p. Call your mum and tell her you won't be home tonight.  - If you think you'll regret it in the morning, we could sleep until afternoon.  - Is it hot in here or is it you?  - Does God know you've escaped from heaven?  - I think I've seen you on the cover of Playboy.  - I'm new around here. Could you direct me to your flat?   - If I could arrange the alphabet I would put U and I together.  - There's something wrong with my eyes - I can't taken them off you.   - I'd really like to see how you look when I'm naked.  - I wish you were a door so I could bang you all day.  - Do you sleep on your stomach or can I?  - You must be tired. You've been running through my mind all evening.  - What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this.  - You look like someone I know.  - Do you come here often?  - Drink up - you've pulled.  - How do you like your eggs in the morning?  - I feel like Richard Gere because I'm standing next to the Pretty Woman.  - You're great at fishing because you've caught me â€“ hook, line and sinker.  - Bond. James Bond.  - You look so good I could drink your bath water.  - Are you free tonight, or will it cost me?  - If I said you had a beautiful body would you hold it against me?
