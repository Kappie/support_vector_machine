I went camping at pine lake about 10 days ago, me and my family go up there alot, just to relax and do a bit of golfing (yes i golf, i would say i'm pretty good at it.) but for some reason the past 10 days, for me, wern't very relaxing... befor i left i had feelings for this one girl i met out there about 5 weeks ago, but after about 3 days of being away from her (we were dating) i began to think about life and what i would be missing out on if i stayed with her. Also the frist day i was up there i met this other girl.... i've known her for about 5 years now, shes a great person... and of course i like her, i never really realized it till i saw her again, she made me forget totaly about the first girl... (i know thats bad, god i hate myself). So i've like this one girl for 5 years.. and i dont get to see her often, i dont even get to talk to her often. I prolly see her once a year for about 10 day... lol. so yeah she was up there for the most part of 10 days, and i couldnt help but.... i dont know, really, really like her. I introduced her to one of my other friends that was up there at the time, and we hungout for the day. we woke up the next day (saterday, july 24, 2004) at around 5:30 a.m. (long story, cut short [ Jeremy {other friend up there at the time} and I were hanging out with this girl and security came by and kicked us out, so we had to go back to our trailers, then the security gaurd mentioned "why dont you guys wake up at 5:30 a.m. because we cant do anything aout that" so sure enough we did] and thats the story) anyways, we woke up and hung out that morning. i started to notice that she liked Jeremy and it was hard to deal with, but hey i might have been wrong. So since i thought that she liked him and not me i felt pretty shitty, once we had to go back to our trailers, i hung out with my uncle and hes a great guy... he gave me alcohol!, yeah... i got drunk that night trying to forget everything.... i had about 11 beers, and for someone that doesnt drink i think thats aalot... i was wasted, but i can still remember the night, so i wasnt that drunk. I woke up at around 1:30 p.m. the next day with a bit of a hangover, got together with the one girl (lets call her Jen), so i got together with Jen and Jeremy that day and yeah it was becoming more and more aparent that she liked him.... to skip ahead a few days, i think it was Tuesday August 3, 2004. Jen told me to tell one of her friends that was playing pool at the time that they needed something for supper, so i left Jeremy and Jen alone... of course i knew that there were going to talk about her liking him, hes a nice guy (he knew that i liked her) and of course she talked about cheating on her b/f (yes she has a b/f) with him, once i got back i told him i was going to get something to eat and he came with me. He told me all about what they talked about (well not all but some). the next day i didnt feel like waking up at 5:30 a.m. so they came and got me at around 8:00 a.m. instead. later that day when Jen went to eat lunch Jeremy was talking to me and told me what had happend well i was asleep (hes a true friend) he told me that she came onto him and he didnt do anything (of course i wasnt there so i dont know what really happend) but he said "I was laying on my bed with my eyes closed and she began to run her finger along my lips, then i opened my eyes and she smiled at me and bit her bottom lip, i told her that i couldnt, and she said " you dont have to touch me" and i said i still couldnt" so he went up and had a shower. then i came and yeah.. you know nothing else happend. this kinda hurt me inside knowning that he could have her and i couldnt... but no matter wha i still couldnt have her. I'm not her "type" or so i think, plus we've been friends too long that she would never look at me in that way. i just dont ever see it working between us, she so perfect and i'm just there.... she sings and she extreamly beautiful... and talented and everything... shes got the best personality and just... eveything, i'm just a bum, and she could do way better. i dont know what to do.... i cant stop liking her and yet i dont want to stop. very confusing for me..... (i sound like a chick here, lol) just knowing that i cant have her makes me insane. yeah.... once talking to the first one (call her Jones) talking to her after 10 made me start thinking again.... how i really like her also, but now i know i messed thinks up so i should get over it..... anyways, i'll prolly put in another addition today but thats enough about this topic  ttfn, Cody
