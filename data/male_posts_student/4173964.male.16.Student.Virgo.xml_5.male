I get there and find out I'm already 10 minutes late for an orientation at the main branch (Breantwood). So me and my buddy Tyson (whom hadn't been told either god bless the managing staff) burn down there and get in just fine. The first half was boring shit (as is the first half of this blog HUZZAH) but when we got back from break it all went uphill. I was sitting beside this mondo hottie named Tannis (like tennis but with an a she says and I love her already due to the wicked ass name) and we start talking. Turns out she's pretty much the female version of me (but only slightly hotter ;) ) and we hit it off immediately. Many was there a time where we were chastised for talking by the speaker (who's sister happens to be one of my best friends girlfriends). Anyhoo the end of the orientation comes and I figured "Oh well here's where it ends" As usual right...BUT NO!! Out of the blue she slips me this piece of paper with her number on it and for me to call her tomorrow when I get off work. So now I'm sitting on cloud nine and don't think it can get any better. BUT IT DOES!!! She lives IN VARSITY FUCKIN' ACRES!! Which for those of you who don't know is the community adjacent to mine. Man oh man am I feelin good. Yeah that was my day...I'm gonna go listen to some Deathcab or maybe some Trews or maybe something completely unrelated to either...OR MAYBE ALL OF THE ABOVE I'MA CRAZY MAN!!!! Yeah I'm really not....you get the ideer. Anyhoo this is James signing off. You stay classy Blogger....
