The mere thought pisses me off.  I stapled my finger today by freak accident.  And last night our chickens decided not to go in their coop after the sunset, so me and my stepmom had to wedge the chicken and chase them around the enclosure, the first time half went in, then we chased them the other way and Francealitta (the one that knocked down the lamp and fought me for ten minutes) decided to escape by pushing on the gate, and to spite me whenever I took a step she would to, so i was like fine.... WHATEVER!  I dived at her missed she ran on the top of my head, pecked me and ran down my back, and into the pen, stupid chicken!  Damn that hen!  When I was younger I refused to be like any of those boring women 'Typical women' I would lament And I was definitely more special than them Guys who attracted me were men with wild ways Some artistic, many others suave and weird in all their own ways But all of them One common characteristic. None was ready to settle down And definitely all had the most interesting excuses Speaking of marriage Maybe true love was like that Marriage is suffering, it kicks a couple into death's grave. Something in me quivered Yes, a tiny voice. When enough was enough I took heed of that voice. And never regretted since. A secure man gives secure love True and steady as the man himself His love is faithful not trying to impress and brings you to that green green pasture under a million stars. Looking in the mirror I see the teenage me lamenting on the typical, boring person in the mirror I grinned, almost speaking aloud "Boi, you'll learn" What you want in a man Is not wild excitement For true love is not defined by the unknown Not mysteries and thrills But the things a man makes known.  Did you also know that in order to have a nativity scene in public you also have to include santa, reindeer, candy canes... etc. BUT if you want to have santa and all that other good stuff you don't have to include the nativity scene, because it's christmas stuff.... isn't that rediculous??? Britney Spears Got married to her friend Jason Alan Alexander... no one cares she's is an adult! Illegal immigrants still shouldn't get licenses or work at fast food restaraunts, but that's self explainatory Two fighter jet planes escorted a plane to a special part of an airport because a lady had wires sticking out of her jacket (wires with negative and positive... not just like a phone jack...) She just had wires in her jacket... maybe she liked them... or thought they were imaginary friends... wouldn't that be creepy? A person afraid of flying looking out the window and you see these fighter jet planes... ooh la la The croc hunter... and his baby... feeding an alligator to make get his baby to be familiar with alligators or something.. ya he pulled a michael Jackson  It's hard to say this in a way that's comprehendable. but I guess I'll try. I just want to have one person who will stay with me forever, or at least a long time. And I always think... Choose the guy because in the end you have a husband not a boifriend you know? But  I have been left only BY guys. Most friends stay with me. I always say that your friends will grow away from you. But in my case, it's always me that grow away from my friends. I have hurt a lot of people in that way. and I didn't realize what a hipocrite I was being. but I have a best friend now and it just makes me think... "Is he gonna do to me, what I did to all the people I hurt?" And I really hope not cause he is my only sanity. But he has difted. If he wasnt' there I would die before I got to where I want to be... but he isn't reaslly there, he has his own and I am out.. But I hate the fact that I think about this all the time. I am always scared that me and him are gonna have another one of our famous falling-outs. I really don't wanna lose him as a best friend. He and I understand each other completely and we have all the same friends and the same taste in everything and we even dislike the same people. But I guess I "stole" him away from his other best friend. So in the end I guess I would get what I deserve. and maybe im just paranoid, or maybe its happening, but I just feel like we're nearing something... maybe its just we're coming soo close and everything is chaotic and apprehensive. Or maybe we're coming to the end of the rope of friendship I have been hanging onto for the past weeks. But like I said maybe im just paranoid. I really hope Im just paranoid.  But I see that the rope is unraveling.
