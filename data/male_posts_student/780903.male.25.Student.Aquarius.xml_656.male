A poem:  So you walk in the classroom And locate your seat As you wish you'd had more Than a corn flake to eat As you boot up your laptop Your eyes scan the crowd There's the ones awfully quiet And the ones awfully loud There are people who look Like they've done this before There's the people who found The *used* books at the store There are hands getting ready To pounce in the air There are those who put thought Into what they would wear There are guys wearing dress shirts That seem a bit, well... There are girls with new outfits It's easy to tell There are some who seem frantic Perhaps they didn't read So if they're the ones called on Your prayers they may need There are some who are breathing So loud you can hear They are shaking with angst They are oozing with fear As the teacher, she enters All eyes turn to her What's the class gonna be like? What frights will occur? She opens her casebook She flips to the page She welcomes you warmly But this is *her*stage You're not the one called on You slowly exhale Your fingers start typing Each tiny detail Of the words that are spoken The thoughts that you hear It's just class like all others Away fades the fear You have done this already It's school, you're okay Your mind starts to wander Your thoughts start to stray But you're jarred back to focus From out of blue The teacher looks up And she's calling on you And you didn't hear the question You look down at the page Around at your classmates Seems *you're* now on stage And you mumble and bumble And feel your way through Ask for clarification Pray a thought comes to you You say one thing, another Some wrong, some okay And then after what seems like At least half a day She retreats and goes after A classmate, a friend As your moment of terror Has come to an end The class ends and you exit You ask "how'd I do?" And you're kind of surprised None recall it was you Some were drifting or fading Exactly like you Some were in their heads thinking Of what they would do If the cards drew them next No one listened to you Sure it's nice to do well But what can you do And you stumble from class Vowing better next day But you realize it's all Gonna turn out okay.
