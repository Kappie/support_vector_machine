I am getting some of the "bestest" education possible but somehow doubt that my future career in digital forensics/security will be able to pay the bills.  The one good thing I do have going for me, other than the monthly supply of Klonnopin, is that I have lost interest in relationships.  My reasons: they are too expensive, at least they have been for me, and I normally come out of a relationship a little closer to psychosis.  As always: all your oil are belong to U.S. / stay negativ
