See it really gets under my skin when freeloaders get holiday without having to pay a dime. Take for example Rachael in Minorca or Frances in New York - both god damn free!I've worked my arse of for the chance of some sun for the first time in 3 years, and for what?  "Oh Matthew, your Father will pay . . . GOD DAMMIT THIS IS MY HOLIDAY WHICH YOU KNOW I'VE SAVED UP FOR, STOP KISSING MY ARSE YOU IGNARAMOUS!"  Well I'm ready to get back in to the writing groove again, but after work mon ami. I shall think of something riveting whilst serving the oldies for 4 hours tonight. Ciao.  xBuBzx
