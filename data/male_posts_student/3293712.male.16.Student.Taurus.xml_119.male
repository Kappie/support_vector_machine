Should I set it down And find another Ten? Or should I hold it and say "One in your hand Is better than 10 in the pit."  Because that is what a drawer is A deep, dark pit That dominates everything Around itself and then some Like a Korean in a Blizzard Game. Never has one Of the Asian Race ever Been called a Noobie For they have forever been Invincible. Every Asian has The innate ability to be Gosu. In the language Of us, that is Godly.   Once more, the pen. It is black and Sharp, A Sharpie to be exact. With this pen, I could Conquer the World, or at least, Give it to those who would. For a pen has always been mightier Than any kind of weapon. With this, countries can me made and wrought from naught.  That poem rocks. Anyways... Go me! Most improved JV doubles.
