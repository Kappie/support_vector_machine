So here I am being faithful to his site and he isn't on to tell me about his day!! But I do know this:  Today, I was suppose to go see Nee-cole but things didn't work out I am so upset. I was really looking forward to seeing her, maybe soon I can. I think I will go to my room and have a good cry, yeah that sounds good.  Mike is not going to allow me to do his posts much longer!! LOL But o well I guess he would have to do them then so haha!! But ya anywho....  This was Nee-cole posting for Mike!! Love ya'll!
