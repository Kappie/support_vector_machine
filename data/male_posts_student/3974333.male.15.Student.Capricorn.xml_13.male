I had my heart set on getting this new album by a band I have just found out about, heard one or two of their songs and thought, why not give it a go. On arrival I went straight to the alternative or rock section whichever they call it these days, and noticed some punk kid dressed in all that wigga clothing make off with the last copy. I was pissed. I think the fact that person who presents themselves in such a fashion would not fully appreciate this type of music. Then I thought again, maybe he does. Sorta opened my mind a bit to how we perceive others just by the way the dress and make and instant judgment by what we see.    I shall tell you a great secret my friend. Do not wait for the last judgement, it takes place every day.  - Albert Camus  I know for a fact, if I was judged on first looks, I wouldn't get far. So rather then approaching this bloke, I merely stood back and took acceptance in the fact that I could order another copy of the album. Matter of fact, had it not been for that kid, I would not have found the album I'd been looking for, for about 3 months. Music As A Weapon II. Best album, live recordings by Disturbed, Chevelle,Taproot, and Unloco. Worth the buy because you pick up a free concert DVD with it so I wasn't complaining. I don't know if any of you have checked my profile, but I am a huge Metallica fan, and was absolutely blown away when I saw that Disturbed had done a Metallica cover in their concert. So I guess I enjoyed this album more then I would the Three Days Grace one, so I say thanks to that kid =P.
