The FBI got there intelligent from a WEBSITE. WOW! I'm happy to know that my hard earned money is going to pay for some geek at the FBI going to Google and typing in al Qaeda and calling the first website they find "credible." Why can't they get anything right? I think the directors of the National Security Council, FBI, CIA, and Homeland Security should resign. Save us from more humiliation.         Okay, I'm done. LOL
