The  urlLink Braves  won today!!....I'm telling ya'll, people are sleeping on them but will win the World Series!  I went to  urlLink Brooks Brothers  earlier and got another of the Golden Fleece polo shirts that feel so wonderfully....unfortunately I got a large and wear an extra large so it looks like I need to go back to Green Hills Mall and exchange it....  Looks like I'm going back to  urlLink Starbucks  tonight for more study time....yeah buddy!!!...start making your appointments now cuz Dr. Smith is gonna be world class!
