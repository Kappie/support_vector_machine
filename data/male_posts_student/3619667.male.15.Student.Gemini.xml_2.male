The most random things pop up unexpectedly. For instance, do a google search for  urlLink waffles .Guess what the top link is? John Kerry.com. I still wonder what kind of person would serch for waffles and be looking for john kerry. Then it begs the question how many people looked for waffles and were trting to find john kerry. Is he a waffle or something? aside from the ugly face that most politicians have, he's pretty normal. What is the world comming to... (the answer is nothing, aka the other brain on this site is named confused destroyer of worlds)...
