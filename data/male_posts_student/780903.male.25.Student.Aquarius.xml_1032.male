Why I just spent twenty minutes surfing MarthaStewart.com instead of doing real work, I'm not quite sure.  I have not found any evidence that Martha Stewart plans to keep a weblog from prison.  But if I did, here's what I might think it would look like on a typical day:   7:13 AM:  After an unpleasant night's sleep that would have benefitted from  urlLink a buckwheat pillow like this one I discovered on my trip to Japan , we were served breakfast on paper plates.  Paper plates!  I miss my  urlLink yellowware .   9:27 AM:  My cellmate got "married" today to the woman in the next cellblock that she has grown quite fond of over the past few weeks.  We held an informal wedding in the library.  I wish I could have given out  urlLink personalized favor boxes  to all of our friends, but instead I just wept silently and thought of  urlLink memories from home , from a life before the Big House.   12:14 PM:  The bread is fresh today.  For that I am certainly thankful.  But how I wish I had some Gruyere cheese and grainy mustard, and access to an oven, so that I could make  urlLink this inventive bread and cheese meal .   2:29 PM:  My shoes got dirty in the garden.  Too bad  urlLink boots  aren't allowed.  Also, Sandra threatened to bury me alive if I didn't stop correcting the way she was  urlLink rolling the hose  back onto the hook.  She said she would "roll  my  hose."  I don't know what she meant by that.   5:15 PM:  Sunset. My favorite time of day.  At least today they didn't  urlLink beat me with a rake .   7:36 PM:  Two things you "must-have" in prison -- (1) a  urlLink springform pan  for savory and sweet cakes and tarts using fresh ingredients from the garden, and (2) some  urlLink striped fabric  to match my jumpsuit, and make all of my accessories fit right in.     8:50 PM:  Dinner is late tonight.  I entertained myself in the meantime by making  urlLink bunny ears .  I found a rotten banana by the dumpster.  I thought of  urlLink this recipe .  I won't be eating that anytime soon.  I ate the banana.  Then Sandra  urlLink beat me with a rake .  And the day had been going so well.  I soaked my jumpsuit in cold salt water to try and  urlLink get out the blood stains .  It seems to be working.   11:02 PM:  Time for bed. I hope I dream about  urlLink baby booties  again.  That's such a pleasant dream.  More from me tomorrow.  I'm Martha Stewart.  And this is jail.
