And i hope one day, my life is really full of hope, faith and love... Acutally my tat strange illness already settle lorz but some of my broth and sis in christ still say tat i always stone... Nw if U see i stone, maybe i was jus trying think of somthing lorz cos i'm slow in thinking mah... I don wish to stone either, sometimes i stone cos nth to do and sometimes i really trying to think somethink... When i need to think of something i need a quiet place oso cos need to concentrate wat... But still, i wish to thank's all my broth ans sis in christ i kno they R trying to help me and they don wish to see me stoning or always mood swim but i oso don wish to... Still, thank's alot and hope tat U all continue to give me support... Hope to see a miracle tis yr!
