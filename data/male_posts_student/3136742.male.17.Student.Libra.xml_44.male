I sat by the pool in the sun drinking mudslides and Yellow Tail shiraz, reading a book and eating a prosciuto, salami, ham, and sharp-provolone sandwich. I read about 50 pages and then went swimming. I swam some laps, got out, had some more wine, and read a little more. Around three pm I had my first dinner of the night; vermicelli in a very traditional, verry light oil and tomato sauce, and a large glass of Chianti as I talked with my grandfather... Came home well exhausted from swimming laps (only about 5 laps... I told you I was a cardiovascular pussy), polished my shoes, and went to my barn patio to read some more. I come in to find another open bottle of Chianti on the counter. Don't mind if I do... The second bottle wasn't as flavorful as the first, but still good-- had an unobtrusive taste with a mild bite, so it would go well with just about anything beef, bread, or red (tomato-y)... Now time for dinner #2; the Boston Butt my dad has been smoking all day, some panzanella, roasted peppers and whatever else... Life is grand
