Its funny too  Love, that is  One day your sitting out on your porch, drinking a soda (or a beer, if  your looking for that grizzled, gritty look)  And they are telling you  Yeah you could get with her  Yeah you probably could  But the question is  Why?  Why would you want to get with her?  Well here's my answer  Fuck you.  It goes from that  To I'll look into it  And then you actually look into it  Because you are a desperate, crazy, son of a bitch  And you realize  That you like her  And that you'd be up late one night  Telling her that you like her  And you're actually self confidant  You lost 15 pounds  And you still dress fly  Not that fly  No gucci suits  No prada  No fendi  Well, your glasses  are fendi  And you realize  That your only gonna be happy  When you can wear a hanes beater and some champion sweats  And feel like your rockin evisu and some j's  Because maybe she wil make you feel like that  And you hope she will  And you think its funny that she goes  You have some balls  Gotta love that
