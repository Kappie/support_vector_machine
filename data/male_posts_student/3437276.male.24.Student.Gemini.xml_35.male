Now, I don't really sleep a lot, but I don't go to bed until four or five in the morning, so noon is pretty reasonable from that standpoint (if from no other).  No school and no work make for some pretty free days, and I am enjoying my summer vacation by trying to do as little as possible.  I don't have very much money to play around with, which is unfortunate, but I'd rather sit around and take advantage of my break than work.  Soon enough I'll be back at Santa Clara, and the classloads that come with it.  As a result of my lazy routine, one day pretty much resembles any other.  This is one reason that I do not use my blog as a means of daily reporting.  Occasionally I'll talk about something I did on a given day, but had I felt obligated to maintain the practice more stringently, most posts would be short and plain.  Not that I'm complaining about being bored.  Nothing is one of my favorite activities, and I know I'll have to part with it soon enough.
