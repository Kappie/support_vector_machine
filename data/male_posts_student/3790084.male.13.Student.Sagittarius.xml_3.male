We are special because we are able to think n act rasionally...  We have feeling... sometimes get very emotionally sad, mad or happy...  We able to talk the human language which is unique and understand among ourselves...  We have the 7 wonder things:   To hear    To see    To feel    To LOVE    To sense/smell    To think    To live    In order to live our life to the fullest, we should set our goals or dream...  so that, we will feel that we are worth a life here...  and we will enjoy whatever we are doing with the believe we will achieve our dream one day...  Everyday challenge is our nutrient for our growth.. ^^  For all my friends out there...  believe in whatever you do... give it all your best, and i am sure u will get the returns one day, someday...  Never too easily to give up your hopes, beliefs and faith...  God is with you, I am with you...  luv,  suit
