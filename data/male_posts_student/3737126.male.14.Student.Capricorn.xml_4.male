What you see around you teaches many things, you just need to  watch ...  1.People don't mind other people's business, unless you are famous, or you are strange. 2. People only read something that interests them, and each person has different interests. 3. Concluding from the statement above, it makes  urlLink our  job more complicated, and the admin wants to put their interest which leads to... 4. Interesting for them,  BORING  for us... 5. Unless you read the editorials and look for an opiion that really rocks...  I'll continue this one later. _________________________________________- I just made this one this week. Check it out...   Division  In our terminal years as editors in our school paper, there are some revisions that needs to be considered regarding the quality of our school paper from the system of the organization to the paper itself:  1. Each member of the staff should belong to a group for them to have a definite subject to focus on. The editor concerned will lead them. e.g.: Photo Staff, News Staff, etc, etc.  2. The Editorial Board should be composed of skilled people in the field of writing. Tried and tested in different scenarios.  3. The Tanglaw office should be extended to give adequate space for many people to work on. The board is composed of many students, but as of present, there is a lack of space.  4. That we be given necessary equipment (e.g.: camera, ream of paper, computer programs, etc.). It will be of great help to those assigned to cover special events, as it will avoid them from spending extra money for the purchase/developing of film, wasted time for bringing various computer programs to school and the like. The computer must be installed with anti-virus scans to avoid infection of the hard drive to avoid work delay.  5. To avoid speculations of favoritism, the outgoing Editorial Board members must do the process of promotion of incoming Editorial Board members. They shall nominate editors/staffers to fill in their place, with the notice of the editor/staffer concerned. The editor/staffer may decline the promotion. They shall base their decision from the performance and dedication given by each, the experience accumulated, and the responsibility and time dedicated to the organization.  6. The whole board should be trained for the enhancement of skills. Remember: skill x training = competitive and talented student while talent – training = average student. If Claret School wants to produce competitive students, then the side of our campus journalists should never be put aside. Claret, as a private school should be able to at least have a stand in local writing competitions.  7. Tanglaw, like any other school paper/ organization, should have their fund. The accumulated school paper fee paid in the tuition fee may be considered as the fund of the organization. Students, and their parents, may want to get their money’s worth.  8. The book “Campus Journalism” by Ceciliano Cruz contains useful tips as well as guidelines in the field of campus journalism. Focused on different kinds of writing, cases, scenarios which a journalist/ school paper may face. It is the reference book used by Quezon City Science High School students in their journalism elective, “The Electron” and “Ang Banyuhay” which topped and won many awards in the interschool journalism contest, considered as the battle of the school papers in their respective divisions last school year. It is recommended that we also use this book as a reference to enhance the different elements that comprise our paper.  It is now requested that these proposals may be considered. It is for the benefit of our school paper, to make a stand and be known, and to be competitive, as our alma mater wishes us to be. Given the best, we will definitely produce the best.  We hope for your kind consideration  _____________________________ Enriquito Ramon Rosales Editor in Chief (last year’s Associate Editor in Chief)  _____________________________ Robel Dabandan Managing Editor (last year’s Features Editor)  _____________________________ Roehl Niño Bautista Associate Managing Editor for two years  _____________________________ Tristan Joshua Arcinue Lay-out Editor for two years  _____________________________ Karlo Nobleza Chief Photographer for two years
