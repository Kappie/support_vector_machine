I even made a list this time.  Nope, didn't do a dang thing.  I'm just too lazy.  I haven't updated in a while but on Saturday we went down to Des Moines and checked out the red '04 SRT-4 they had.  It sucked because they SAID they had it sold when we got down there.  So by the time we called them and the time it took us to actually get down there, they sold it.  So we couldn't test drive it!  It already had 71 miles on it though.  But, I guess that kind of tells you what kind of demand there is for this thing.  It gets better though.  Just today the guy called us up on the phone and said the people didn't want it!  So we drove down there and under the impression that it was sold and couldn't drive it.  Someone said they would buy it and didn't and I was screwed out of driving this thing.  I guess it doesn't bother me as much as it may seem.  I doubt I'll be getting one of these things soon.  I have to actually get some money and check the grade reports.  Fun stuff... sacrasm.  I've got a lot of homework I don't really want to do right now.  Something just happened that annoyed me.  I think I'm going to make a personal list of annoyances.  It will be fun.  I'll post it when it gets long.
