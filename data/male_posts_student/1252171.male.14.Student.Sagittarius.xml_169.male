"Can you get us inside?" "Of course," says Sa2b. They both vanish in a puff of smoke.  Sa2b and Camo reappear inside, and hide instantly. "Camo, create a distraction." "Why should I when you can poof us to the end of the hall?" inquires Camo. "Too much noise, just do it. There's a reactor over there," Sa2b points out. "OK, but you owe me," says Camo, as his hands light on fire. You see, Camo had control over ice, fire, and earth. "Earth" includes plants as well. On the good side, he could combine them to make water, mist, blue fire, and quicksand. On the bad side, it made him a hydroterrapyromaniac. "FFYYYYYYYYYRRRRRRREEEE! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!" screams Camo, as he blows up the reactor. Luckily, no one could hear him over the roar of the flames. As all the guards run to the explosion, the two brothers make a run for it. When they reach the room, Camo reads the sign on the door, "Weather controlling secret weapon." "That would be him," says Sa2b. They open the door and walk in.   To be continued...    OK, so it wasn't the climax. Writing the entire ending would take to much time. You're lucky you got anything at all. -Sane Intolerant-
