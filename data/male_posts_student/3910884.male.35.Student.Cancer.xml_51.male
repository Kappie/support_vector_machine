Unfortunately this means that this first blog posting will be huge (naman!) and will be in digest format (actually most of them will be in digest format!).  In regards to specific NGO notes (collected scientific data and observations on target communities and populations in regards to strengths and limitations, assessments on current health status and suggested methods for interventions) those notes may be placed on a separate BLOG since I'm trying to keep that log specifically for that reason and as of now has become quite filled with notes on the plight of indigenous Filipinos.  The format is 'date' and then 'title' followed by a brief description when applicable and then the meat of the story. So without further adieu, here's the scoop...   7/5/04 "A Night Out..."  (This was actually a writing assignment so I wrote about our first night out on the town in Makati and it was storming outside as I wrote this thus the symbolism...)  The first thing I noticed was the smell, or more exactly the scent. The scent was like the beginning of a monsoon; thunder rolling in the background, the crescendo of noice increasing as she approached, the air thick and heady and difficult to breathe like tropical humidity. I found myself gasping...  Lightning flashed as she passed by. I could feel the electricity from her body. A carona of energy so brilliant and mystifying, so dangerous and unpredictable, yet I was unable to move, transfixed by her subtle movements, the she walked, the curves of her body...  Lightning flashed again as she turned my way, her dark sable eyes revealing a spirit that was intense yet at the same time soothing, eyes that could burn away your soul or lift you t places never dreamed of...  I was frozen in place. There was no chance of leaving even if I wanted to. A downpour was starting that would either cleanse my soul or sweep me away...   7/8/04 "Musings..."  (This is an attempt for me to consolidate the Filipino courses we had in Makati)  Much has happened over the past few days since our initial Philippine culture and identity classes started and only a day since it's end on 7/7/04.  I think I have a basic understanding about Filipino culture that can be described with two definitions:  1) Fractured Culture: Simply, because there is no set cultural identity. How Can Filipino-Americans (FilAms) look for their cultural identity when Filipinos (living in the Philippines) themselves can't define what it is to be Filipino.  2) Cultural Resiliency: The Filipino(a) is a resilient person, capable of incredible things simply because of his or her determination to do so and with the attitude of  BAHALA NA  (not in the fatalistic sense of what ever happens happens, but in the sense of being able to overcome obstacles).  I think for most Filipinos (and for FilAms as well), we need to understand and accept one another. Filipinos are Filipinos not matter what part of the Philippines they are from. We are all  KABABAYANS  despite our regional differences.  In synthesis, Filipinos are  HALO-HALO .  Okay, machismo-time (or MACHO as the pinoys call it). There are some really cute women in both the Foundations and Fellows. Okay, there I said it and now I can go to bed... ;)  Some quick notes on the AWECA Foundation: AWECA is pretty massive in that it is a comglomerate of several companies owned by the same family that produce raw materials, own production facilities, as well as shipping facilities) and provides over 3,000 jobs to people in Angeles City. It is also important to note that AWECA is very community oriented and believes in community self-empowerment and and increasing social capital.  Tomorrow we head to Barangay Maruglo in Tarlac to meet with Aetan tribal leaders therefor I shall let Sleep's sweet emrbace envelope me... (I'm inspired by Rizal's poetic nature!!!). ;)   7/9/04 "Early morning relfections..."  (Well, sleep was short so I decided to read my Anels and Demons book by Dan Brown and ended up finishing the book which got me to thinking...)  3:00AM - How can God be omnipotent and benevolent if He loves us and knows all, wouldn't He protect us?  God does love us and does protect us in one way or another, however He allows us to make our own decisions.  These decisions although painful are how we learn about life. It's a part of growing up and in a sense, is how we protect ourselves.   7/9/04 "The trip to Barangay Maruglo..."  (Not much here, just a descrption of the trip to Barangay Maruglo, located in Capas, Tarlac. Of special note is that BRGY. Maruglo is the last 'civilied' settlement before the 3-4 hour hike to the sitios where the Aeta live.)   There was some major concern about the way I dressed this morning. I was looking forward to wearing my fatigues from the military because I had specifically brought them for the sole purpose of 'getting dirty.'  My host NGO was shocked by my attire and requested strongly that I change since I would stand out with them. I find that ironic since I stand out no matter where I go in the Philippines. Also, this brings about why the Aetas would react so poorly if I had worn my fatigues. Perhaps they were abused by the military here?  Anyways, I can see my other options as explained by the NGO also, such that civilians normally don't wear fatigues so the military would be wondering why I was wearing them. I suppose in this case discretion is the better part of valor and I should place my pride to the side...  Well, the trip to BRGY. Maruglo was pretty uneventful. The scenery was nice in the distance however driving through the various barangays I could see how economically depressed the area was. Never the less there was a hustle and bustle of Filipino life, carefree as ever.  By the way, Anajay at Ayala Foundation was so true, Filipino drivers are insane... ;)  Later in the day, I met a few tribal leaders and was told I would meet more tomorrow to discuss the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) in regards to their livelihood microloan they are receiving which is PHP 27,000.00 each (3 sitios).  ... Bummer, no cell signal in Barangay Maruglo...  Well, I knew I was in the Philippines when someone asked if I needed a  TABO  for the  COMFORT ROOM  (CR) and I knew I was in the province when we started eating all our meals with our  KAMAY . ;)
