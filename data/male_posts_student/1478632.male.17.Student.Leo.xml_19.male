No, it isn't a really big thing for most people out there, but I just got a new car (mentioned in previous posts), and I drove it around Concord and my neighborhood. I  really  love this car a lot. My mom filled it up with gas before she went to Market Basket, and it took less than $10 lol.  I've been training at work, and today I was put with a weird guy named Matt. He's a little slow, I'd say. He liked to repeat his strange sayings (none of which were about the job), and took his time with, well, pretty much everything we did. Whatever.  Today we watched some of Saving Private Ryan in History. Good movie.  Very  good movie. After I'd read the material backgrounding the scenes we watched, I had the strangest desire to play  urlLink Day of Defeat , and I found out tonight that I'm pretty good at being a Sargent/Unteroffizer/Sargent Major. I'm also not too shabby in the Sniper/Marksman/[German Sniper] class. Anything with an automatic non-rifle or a scope, I'm pretty good with, especially in close quarters (not the scope on that part, more the sub machine gun). I went 57/21 with a score of 42 in one round. (Not too bad for someone who'd never played before, eh?) I'm not sure how they award points, but I think it's based on your kill to deaths ratio.  Oh ya--just in case you've noticed typos or things that don't make sense, I'll never go back to change a post other than to make it legible, so I'll never have to be accused of changing information, and I'll not have ot forget things that were important to me at a certain point in my life. If this happens to come back and bite me in the ass, so be it.  Hmmmm....Nothin' else to say tonight.  --Raine
