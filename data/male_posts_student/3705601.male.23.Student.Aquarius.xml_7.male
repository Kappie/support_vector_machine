As I watched the whole cermony, I realized that I'm so happy that the Hall Of Fame is stil inducting real musicians and/or songwriters. After that, I pondered even deeper. I even got as far as thinking which of today's music stars will be inducted into the Hall Of Fame. A thought that is not to pleasing to think of, so why I even thought of it is beyond me. I realized that the title "Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame" is not just about Rock music, but rather about all music in general. Any of today's artists can be elected, but who is deserving? If you ask me, no one yet.  Today's music industry is more conscious on image and no longer pays attention to what is important (i.e. THE MUSIC!). If you look at the artists that sell the most records, they are artists that don't really do anything but sing. To be honest, anyone can sing. Don't get me wrong, singing is a real talent, but it isn't as great a talent as playing the guitar because there is a lot of theory and knowledge required to play an instrument. Today's artists don't even write their own music. Usually, there are other people who write these song (the "hitmakers", if you will). These people are the unsung heroes of the music industry. The other unsung heroes of the music industry are the session musicians that play the instrument as the back-up bands of these artists (who are not musicians, but artists. I use the term "musician" sparingly because they really aren't musicians). None of these people deserve to be in the Hall Of Fame (according to the committee responsible for voting people in). The wrold is running out of legitimate musicians and when that happens, who are they going to induct in the Hall Of Fame? Probably someone who doesn't deserve it like many of today's artists. Don't get me wrong, there are some good ones, but unfortunately, they're not getting equal air-time on the TV and on the radio because other acts whose music doesn't even make any sense are the ones that do sell. It is unfortunate that that really good musicians have a small following, while people who can't even play an instrument (or in the case of many of these artists, can't even sing) are getting rich in an industry that should not be about anything but music. The Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame should recognize the people who do their thing well, and not just those who people know as household names. Just like the Pro Football Hall Of Fame inducting offensive linemen, the guys who are not poster boys, household names, or in fact even known. They do their job and make those around them better. Do you think that a Loe Montana would be who he is if not for his linemen? That's exactly how I feel about the songwriters and back-up bands for pop singers. Do you think that Beyonce's music would sound good without her back-up band? But who will get all the recognition, fame, and more importantly (althoug it shouldn't be) the money? Beyonce does. The back-up band members get nothing. It truly is sad that an industry that concentrates on how something sounds can be conscious of looks, when it is something that is important and completely superficial. The worl really is running out of legitimate musicians, and in the long run, the music industry will suffer. I can't change it, but all I can say is, GO LEARN AN INSTRUMENT!
