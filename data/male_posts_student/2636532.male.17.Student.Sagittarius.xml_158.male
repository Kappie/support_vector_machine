This was bothering me for a while until it dawned on me.....HOTLINE!!!!!!! Absolutely the greatest file sharing program ever, it's been around for a long time, even if you've never heard of it, it been around for MAC users since around ....................19................94..............ish...............I think. but anyway, even dispite the sometimes frustrating rules set out by some of the servers, I see their point for them, they don't want to get arrested, they are covering their pirate asses, and god bless them for that  adios   oh ya, you can get Hotline at  urlLink http://www.hotspringsinc.com/
