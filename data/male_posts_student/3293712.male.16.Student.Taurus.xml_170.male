Not as cool, but more convenient. After that I repaired to Johns house to tinker with my iPod.  After a lot of waiting, and frustration, we managed to load 600-ish songs on to it. The majority of the songs have yet to be put on it, as it got too late and I went home. I left my CDs with John to load on iTunes, though.   I love it. I'm going to bring it everywhere.  Tomorrow is Battle of the Bands, in which I expect to see the usual locals  (Friendly C, Feedback, the Newmans, etc, etc.) But the  real  reason I am going is to see Schilling's band stumble through some All-American Rejects and Something Corporate covers. I can't imagine a funnier afternoon than that.  On the DQ: like John said, it isn't such a bad place to work, especially if you hit the Dairy Jackpot and get to work with Lewis. The  majority  of the people there are on drugs, be it just pot, like Jim and others, or meth, like Shelby. Pretty much all the other workers have to bail once my grandma makes them get a drug test. It is kind of sad, working with a bunch of teenage burnouts who have no purpose other than getting high. But my mom is the worst. She is crazy, just like I claim, but everyone ignores me. Well, when she knifes someone (probably me), I'll say "I told you so," unless she manages to kill me, in which case it will be my epitaph.  Hobe got an iPod also. He also commented on the blog. God forbid that he actually blog, because that would be waaaay too mind-blowing.  Sadly, I have to work on Sunday, so I won't get a chance to march with the BACP. I will make the fireworks at night, however.   Were I a conservative, I would sabotage the BACP by marching with them and giving the Hitler salute to fellow liberals. Now, I know that wasn't PC, but it made me laugh pretty hard.   In other news, Bill Cosby ranted about the black community today (again). If you ever saw  The Cosby Show  back in the day, you'd know why I find this funny. Just watching Bill Cosby  talk  is hilarious, and seeing him complain about what is wrong with kids today would've killed me.  I'm tired, good night.
