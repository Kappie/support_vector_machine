I may have been quite fooled by her facade during the play, and I think it'd be funny to go through my though process as I watched her dance in her school musical (Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat brought to you by Oak Knoll).  Here is how it started upon first seeing her (she had a black wig on, and the hair was straight mind you add in that she took away her glasses as well):  "Wow, that Asian girl sure looks good."  "Oooh my goodness, no.  Only black girls look good! Must enforce social engineering on myself!"  "Hmmm... She looks like she's Fillippino or something.  That would explain the dark skin."  Time passed by, I noticed some Semetic-Hindic looking people walk by, a decent number.  "Wow, sure are alot of Indian (Or Arab) people at this school.  Oooh snap! That girl is Arab or Indian that explains everything."  Kelly's sister comes and sits in front of me.  I don't really pay attention to her pointing Kelly out (I instantly knew it was Kelly's sister).    "Oooh wait.  That girl isn't Asian, it's Kelly!"  Lo and behold it was.  That's the amazingness of my thought process.   Next order of business.  I hadn't really thought about it until today, I've suddenly started to hang out with far more black people then usual.  I think it's that identity crisis thing that hits people in high school, at least minorities.  Abby pointed it out once, that most of the black people in our journalism class sit on one side of the room.  This is of course true, and ironically, I believe I unconsciously gravitated towards that side.    That's not the point though.  I even intentionally changed where I sat at lunch to get a better look at certain people's booties.  Ahaahaha.  I said booty. Well, this guy, I think his name was Brandon, he comes and sits at our table today.  This guy wasn't exactly 'hard' but he was more or less hardened by Black Pop Culture into the media image he's supposed to be.  Some of his friends came over, I only knew one of them and they started talking about a dance at Seton Hall (I'll assume it was the Jack and Jill one) and you know "Shuckin' and Jivin'' (I love Hot97).  It was at that point I realized something about DuBois and his talented 10th philosophy.  Not only is it correct, but when you see Black people who are more or less sheep and feel pain about it, you need to realize that most people by nature are sheep.  It really depends on the people who are leading them.  This is why democracy doesn't really work too well, most people are sheep.  That's why so people vote today, no real care.  Hell, most people only need to know they can have minimal input in the government to believe democracy works.  Now what does this have to do with my revolutionary black philosophy?  Well, most leaders seem to start in the wrong place.  It's the idea of 'memes' or information in a human population working like a virus or dna.  Over time it spreads throughtout the population.  Popular culture is an extremely virulent meme, especially 'racial images'.   Most sheep can usually by caught by those in a second, and speaking directly to the sheep usually isn't as effective as changing the primary viral stuff.  That's why alot of movements for social change are doomed for failure.  Now of course, many will say I'm being a conspiracy theorist, but like the exploitation done under Capitalism, I don't believe the opressors are fully aware of it.  So, what's the solution?  Do a group of people who believe they have control, try and control everyone else?  Yes and no.  We've fought throughout history over who has the right to rule, that's why we let god adjudicate.  Of course we needed to create a god, that would rule over us... "..God created humanity; [but now human beings] create God.  That is the way it is in the world- human beings make gods, and worship their creation.  It would be more appropriate for the gods to worship human beings!"-Gospel of Phillip.  I guess things are still like that, people can't force their views directly so we create things that are more powerful then us to give our commandments down.    This puts anyone seeking liberation into a ---  Well I'm running too long with theory and not enough about social things most of which I neglected to mention, like the fact I met Jodie.  Or that one of Kelly's sexually appealing (!) blonde friends who wonders where Cahoots is, thinks I'm cute (because I am like Wayne Brady white people love me).  But that's just a rumor, and I really don't show love to homothugs, I mean rumors.
