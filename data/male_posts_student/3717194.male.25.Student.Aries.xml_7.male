There are five thingsone will notice in the museums: 1) people would rather look at the diamonds and jewels than the cultural artifacts; 2) people would rather look at planes with guns on them than without; 3) everyone loves space (and anything related to space…even that God awful space ice cream); 4) boys like to take girls to the museum both because it is free and to flex their “knowledge” about thestuff in the museum; 5) there is no reason the Wooly Mammoth should be extinct. I am sure each of these five observations could be expanded into a 200+ page social commentary, but due to laziness, I will only expand on one…for now.     Watching couples in the Museum:    Youwill hear some pretty funny stuff if you walk around and eavesdrop on different people in the museum. Among my favorite people to eavesdrop on are couples. Regardless of whether they are MM, MF, FF, MFF, or MG [1] , one member of the couple or triple (usually the male and never the goat) is trying desperately to impress the other with their knowledge of the museum exhibits. Most of this knowledge is pieced together from scattered educational experiences from decades ago that have been clouded with malted hops and bong resin (thank you Tommy Boy); however, surprisingly, many of the tidbits of information these ill-equipped teachers spit out are almost right…some, however, are just completely made up. Some examples:    Example 1:  M: “See that baby, that is the Bell X-5; that plane, piloted by Tom Yeager, was the first plane to break the sound barrier. [2] ”  F: “Wow! That’s impressive! How do you know that?”    Example 2:  M: “The current leading hypothesis is that the dinosaurs actually became extinct because of a fad diet. [3] ”  F: “Wow! You know, that actually makes sense!”    Example 3:  M: “You know, I do not think it would be bad for us to mate because we both evolved from the same species. [4] ”  G: “Bahhhhh”     So what is the result for the recipients of the false information? The recipients either: 1) integrate the information, and become stupider; or 2) ignore the information, and remain neutral. What would the result be if the teacher had not taught at all and just grabbed the recipient’s ass throughout the museum? The recipient would remain neutral. The message is clear: Um…oh yeah…Don’t tell people things that are not true; they will either be worse of or no better than if you had simply grabbed their ass…I declare July 25, 2004 National Shut Your Mouth and Grab a Butt Day…somewhere this train derailed…my apologies. Oh yeah, if you would like to order space ice-cream or other similar atrocities,click thelink:  urlLink http://nasastore.jsc.nasa.gov/bigpicts/icecream.html        [1]  M=male; F=female; G=goat    [2]  Real Fact: The Bell X-1 was piloted by Chuck Yeager and was the first plane to break the sound barrier.    [3]  Real Fact: That statement is actually complete bullsh*t; however, it does make sense.    [4]  Real Fact: I have no idea.
