However, I still think it's a good idea to keep a weblog for our project (as what GRAHAM said!). I planned to post all our meeting minutes here. And u all can give any comment about our project!  As I am still new to the Blogger, I'm not sure whether they have column function to classify posts into different columns. Anyway, for now I'm going to use this very ancient way to indicate what the post is roughly about, like [NEWS], [MINUTES], etc.  OK, enjoy our project^^
