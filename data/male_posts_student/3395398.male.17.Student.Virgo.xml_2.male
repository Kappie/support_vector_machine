I was afraid that nobody may turn up, I was afraid that the invitation CD will not work I was afraid that the program won't flow probably  I was afraid that I might say something wrong during the Briefing I was afraid that people will get bored I was afraid that the response is not so good I was afraid...  There are so many things to afraid of. Yesterday while me and Candice were at the School front gate, both of us are worried and afraid of all the same things. So she started tell me, God had helped her in her Chinese and she corrected me that, God helps everyone, people who wants to help himself and people who doesn't want to help himself, just that God's will not help in the way you want him to. So, she prayed, prayed that everything will be fine. and God, again, shine his power and love on all of us, it was a SUCCESS and all our worries are gone.   Just yesterday, got to meet a few new friends, Khurshed, Yisha and Prisicilla(the mythical girl). Life should be like that, full of happiness, full of challenges, full of love, full of smile. Just hope that everyday is like that, I never want to live in a day of dullness.  Now is already end of May, i am just wondering if my wish for this coming 18th birthday will come true. Actually that depends on fate, nothing i can do.  Looking forward the actual convention!
