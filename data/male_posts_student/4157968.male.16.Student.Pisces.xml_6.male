The first, being my monthly J-Crew catalogue, I quickly devowered, while the second, I had to think twice about. It was a letter from a beloved/beleagured president. It was your standard campaign letter, thanking me for my continiued support, and asking for a charitable donation to the "Bush-Chenney foundaion". I even got a cool " 'W' in '04! " bumper sticker, which i intend to place proudly somewhere at AFS (take that liberal thesbians!). However, I do find it rather interesting that I've managed to slip onto their mailing list. This is my second such letter (who could forget the infamous "George-Laura autographed photo", which is now resting proudly in my top drawer) since the campaign has begun. It is highly humorous to me, because I am in no way a Republican, and given almost any other man running under the democratic ticket, I would endorse him and not Bush. Secondly, I am a minor, and thusly, it is illegal for me to contribute financially to their campaign.       The predominant thought, as I hastilly compiled a letter (telling them to stop asking me for money, because I can't, and won't give any) was how in the heck was my name ever put on their list. I'm neither a wealthy buisnessman, nor a Christian supremist living in the Midwest, so why are the republicans interested in me? Am I to asume that former socialists, attending Quaker schools, who have harshly critisized Bush in the past, are prime candidates for Bush campaigners? Is Republican logic so fundamentally flawwed that despite that fact they have nearly double he campaign money tha the democrats do, they still need to heckle 16 y/o's for chump change? I mean, even if I were to give them the minimun gift of $25, does that really make a difference considering they allready have over $250 million?       ..... And to think, this is the party i'm endorsing for the upcoming election.. Where have you gone Bill Clinton? Constitutional Amendment against gay mariage? I think we need a Constitutional Amendment allowing presidents more than two terms.
