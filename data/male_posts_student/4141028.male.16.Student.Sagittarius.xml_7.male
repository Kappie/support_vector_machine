I pretended not to be able to open my locker so I wouldn't be just standing out in the hall.  I went to my 1st block class, Chemistry.  The teacher is very nice, which is a plus.  The kids in there were rather accepting, they didn't make fun of me...so that's cool.  The I went to my 2nd block, now that's an awesome class.  I sit in a room by myself and make the school's webpage, awesome.  I don't have to be social or anything...haha god that's pathetic.    Then there's lunch.  Lunch was scary.  I sat with a girl who also transferred.  About midway through our lunch this girl comes up to me and asks if we want to sit with them.  The guys beside me were talking about their trucks so I figure anythings gotta be better than this.  So I sat with them and told them about myself.  I really liked that girl...she was nice.    After lunch I went to my US History class: I've never seen a more brainwashed group of kids on earth.  They were all Jr. Conservatives, it was crazy.  We had to do a read around on the war in Iraq.  I was the only person who opposed it...you can imagine the looks I got.    I went to Journalism 4th block.  Journalism was cool; they liked my ideas for fundraisers for the yearbook.  I think that the class should be fun.  They think I'm Mr.Yearbook and it's gonna suck that in MY Journalism class...we did journalism...not yearbooks.  That's about it for my day.  A Ram in Wildcat Country...strange days.
