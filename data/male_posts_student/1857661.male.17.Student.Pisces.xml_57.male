Perhaps you only took it as a way to get out of other, more pressing tasks? We thought so. In fact, it looks like your life centers around avoiding work. Do your weekends consist of short excursions from the your warm, cozy bed? Do you think TV Guide qualifies as great literature? Remember, the remote control may very well be one of mankind's greatest achievements, but someone did have to do a little work to invent it. Why don't you try your luck and put a little effort into something, too? You might be surprised at what you can accomplish when you commit to something besides napping.  Why is sloth so bad? Well, according to early religious scholars, sloth destroys zeal. When we cut ourselves off from life's vitality, we'll eventually fall victim to complacency. We should fight the deadening of our spiritual senses by responding to the zeal and energy of our inner nature. It could be worse: Medieval Italian poet Dante Alighieri thought sloth was only the fourth deadliest of the seven sins, behind pride, envy, and wrath. (Of course, that ranking was based on Dante's own love of sleeping...)    p.s. ugh.... i don't think its accurate...
