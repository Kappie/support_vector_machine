Song :  Led Zeppelin :  Babe I'm Gonna Leave You ,  Black Eyed Peas :  Let's Get It Started    Band : JET   Movie : Spiderman 2   Book :  Kavalier and Clay  by Micheal Chabon   Well, things are starting to come together. The last day at Mather, I found my journal, which I had intended to write down any good jokes in. I wrote in a few that I could remember, and then read what else was in there. Among it was a very good outline of my character-in-development. Formerly known as Shiro, and even formerly known as just Tom, the pseudo-samurai was born as I was reading  Shogun  by James Clavell, and so I was obsessed with Japanese culture.   After getting to know a wide range of people on deviant urlLink ART , and cooling off my obsession by finishing the book, I realised that samurai were far too common an obsession. So, I took all the key elements of the character, but dumped the katana, kimono, and name (but kept the Zen Buddhism). Now, I think I have another application for good ol' Shiro.   As you can see above, I have just finished watching Spiderman 2. Review next blog entry. I am also reading  Kavalier and Clay  by Micheal Chabon, which is about two kids who dream up a comic book hero called the Escapist and reap cashmoney.   I also developed a little joke with  urlLink Kris  about a superhero duo, making us Captain Abnormal and her faithful sidekick, Bacon Boy.   (See where I'm going with this?)   So. The perfect avenue for my character/mascot would be from samurai to superhero. The question is, what kind? I hope I can figure this out myself, but I need your help because frankly I'm too lazy to think that hard. Here is the character outline:    He cares little for life, which makes him virtually emotionally invulnerable. This is his main advantage, for he can beat even those with superior fighting skills (of which there are few) by finding and prying into their weaknesses. He is completely cut off emotionally except when he engages in art in all its forms. He fights against evil of the physical world and the evil of the spirit, such as corruption, blind power, and the like.   He prefers to be alone, because extended contact with others slowly drags down his defenses, and might allow him to attach himself to someone. This cannot happen at any cost, attachment to any person or anything. He speaks very little, and when he does, it is profound and wise.   His knowledge covers just what subjects concern the world he is in, and in those he is second to none. He knows history, every culture, every civilization, every economy from the dawn of time until the present. He can use over 50 different methods of hand-to-hand combat, and knows hundreds of others.   His style of fighting is based on speed. He has no more strength than an average man, but has intensely quick hands, feet, senses, and reactions. He has tremendous patience.   From his detachment from other people and his fight for good, he has created a parallel with nature which leads to deep understanding between him and the large force that some might label as Mother Nature that has a presence in all life.   During his free time, he will meditate nearly all the time, or engage in meditative activities. These include exploring the wilderness on his faithful horse, swimming laps around the lake near his home, talking walks or long runs, or staying home to read up, practive his fighting, or writes, draws, or writes music. He loves speed, so he will take his various vehicles out on the rarely-driven roads by his house and push the needle.   Unfortunately, I have few flaws for him. He will cost the life of innocent bystanders in order to defeat an enemy, or might have to face temptation to women or friends. In his fightig technique, he could get stuck in a test of strength against the opponent and be beaten.   So. All I have to do is invent a history, refine his character, give him a claim to fame and a name (Cajun man voice: Rhymation!) and he'll be a good superhero. He should be known for either his nobility and rigidness or for his quickness and need for speed. Oh yeah, and I need a non-ninja non-samurai warrior for him to be. Please give me comments or notes and help out!   [ urlLink b ]ac0n
