Are you gonna waste you're time thinkin  how you growed up , or how you missed out?"  so i guess what I'm tryin to say by writing this is that ........ don't waste time on going for what you want. shoot for it, if you don't get it, you know now instead of wondering.  and take life and live it to the fullest. it wnt kill you to live a little. And besides, it's too short to not do anything with.
