I went to an old friend of mine's party and talked to a bunch of people and now I have a new guitar teacher/helper for 20 days. He's such a cool guy. Oh, and I worked for my neighbor for a couple hours emptying the shingles out of her car for like 20 bucks. Not horrible for unskilled labor, if you ask me. Anyway, that's about all the time I have for posting because my dad is on my ass yet again for being up so late. Oh, right, one more thing... Andy Roddick (#2 in world tennis) is kinda hot in my opinion. I dunno what most girls think, but he's got a nice look about him. I know some girls really hate beards and stuff, but I think that I'd rather have 'em a little scruffy than baldy-faced. That's just me though, but even still if Roddick shaved, he'd still be hot. I have a theory, a weak generalization with no proof whatsoever is more like it, but it goes like "Guys look better when they're sweaty than when they're not in most natural* scenarios." Anyway, that was dumb, and no, I'm not gay -.-.  I will be sure to make a massive post about everything tomorrow. I don't have a lot to do then.  That is all. -- Feanor   * Clubs, raves, discos, (whatever you want to call it), restaurants, the dinner table, a party, things like this are not natural. They are totally man-made and are like, unnatural.
