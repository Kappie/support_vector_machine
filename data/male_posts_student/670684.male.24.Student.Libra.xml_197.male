I was interested in Shelley when she was sitting across from me, and Emily when she was wearing boots and sitting at the lunch table with the plaid tablecloth, but if I was out playing handball, I was interested in handball.  Not the same with Nicole.  I remember one Novembwer where me and some friends were playing Butts Up or something, and Nicole scampered by, and I was totally lost in the game, to the point that I got the last two letters, allowing Nicole to scamper back past right as Mark Joya slammed a tennis ball between my shoulderblades.    Nicole was popular, but it was more because she was good looking and a free spirit rather than because she played by conventions.  She was confident in her voice, acted older than who she hung out with, and wasn't afraid to show that she was smart.  She also had beautiful brown hair with natural blonde highlights, at about shoulder length, and when she'd practice tennis, it would bob from left to right, or right to left with a backhand shot.    It is terrible that the memory I vest so much confidence in lets me down at this moment, because I honestly spent August 1990 to June 1991 totally invested in Nicole Kruse.  Two events can testify to this; one relates back to her tennis; we would hold basketball practice where she had tennis lessons, and if we missed a lay-up, we would have to run the length of the practice facility; I missed countless lay-ups just to run down past Nicole; it made no sense to me that she wouldn't be interested in someone that would miss 9 out of 10 lay-ups.    The other is a lot greater, and no matter what will sound trite, but I wrote my first screenplay about Nicole Kruse.  Actually, my first two.  For a kid who spent most of his adolesence as a klutz with a funny last name, popularity seemed impossible to reach.  There was no way I could ever go out with Nicole Kruse (she was dating Luis Lopez, a hard kid from Rancho Penisquitos with a reputation for gangbanging...I remember in March 1991, I was doing the musical  Grease! , and we were trying to drum up viewership so we sang three songs at a local elementary school carnival, and Nicole was there, and she watched and smiled as my solo number passed, and when the next song started, she and Luis walked out, and I stood and watched, pathetically providing "doo-op" at the necessary juncture), so I would conjure up ways that we could get together.  The first idea involved two kids with divorced parents (much like me and Nicole; what a convenience!), and our parents getting together, and how our relationship would blossom because of it (with the inevitable hardship lurking, her being popular, me not, and then the stigma of us being stepsiblings).  The second,  Japan , actually involved me writing ten pages; a class flies to Japan for a field trip of some sort, magic happens, and at some point Luis ends up proposing to Nicole, leaving the Rolin character standing in a Tokyo intersection, pulling the timeless fall backwards faint.    Nicole Kruse...I left out so much...the story of the tidy whities in my backpack that she found, my posturing for a position in a school play where she would have to kiss me, every sly move I pulled to sit next to her when seat assignments were changed, and 6th Grade Camp, where I somehow ended up in every group activity that she took part in.
