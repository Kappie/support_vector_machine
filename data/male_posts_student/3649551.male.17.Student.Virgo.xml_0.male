Before you run screaming into the night, I'll lead into things with this statement: I define faith as an extension of reason. I don't believe concepts because they don't make sense. I think about things logically; it's just the way my mind works. And as we all know, we can't KNOW anything for sure, philosophically speaking. So we believe everything we "know," if you catch my drift. This being the case, I believe in God. Let me start by saying why I don't believe in Big Bang, or evolution, or any other such rubbish scientists have tried to push on us. If everything in the universe is cause and effect, and EVERYTHING in existence is bound to cause and effect ... what caused the universe? If something didn't cause it to exist, then some people say it's been around an infinite amount of time. How does that work? I thought that the amount of usable energy in any system decreases over time. If the universe is infinitely old, wouldn't all usable energy be unusable by now? So I think the universe had a beginning. Well, if it had a beginning then something not bound to cause and effect must exist. Something that IS infinitely old. Something that exists, but was not caused ... but was able to cause the universe to be. That's right, an uncaused cause. The term 'supernatural' is useful here: it describes something that isn't bound to natural laws. A Supreme Being, or simply, God. I'm going to say a few more things about scientific theories on the nature of the universe. There are some things that science cannot decide. Scientific processes depend on testability. Concepts like the Big Bang and evolution cannot be tested, and therefore, are not scientific at all. Those theories are speculation and philosophy, created by scientists. Just because a scientist says something doesn't make his or her statement scientific. This would also mean that the existence of God cannot be scientifically proven. That's fine with me. Remember what I wrote about faith being an extension of reason? This is the point where faith comes in. I know it can't be proven - just as any logical scientist would know that evolution cannot be proven conclusively. But there is enough logic in it to believe that it is true. Hmm ... truth ... interesting subject. I'll have to discuss that later. I've got more on the existence of a Supreme Being, but I'll leave it at that for now. I don't want to lose the theoretical readers who really aren't actually reading this.
