Samuel See Boyao, a mention of that very name and I feel like puking my existence out of myself. He is a friggin deperate asshole who laughs like a bloody Hyena. He is such a desperate wuss that he needed a loser last year to introduce him to a loser girl. One look at his screwed up face and you'll know why he's so bloody desperate. Stupid, low class and unhumouring idiocracy is what I will describe his life as...  Well, he's really not as bad as the bitch of the class I will term as the 'Deena Awardee'. Being a secretary of the class he seems to hold more power than anybody else in the class. For some reason he doesn't dare face the class, has absolutely no confidence and charisma, but in front of the teachers... Ooh, that's a totally different story! "Oh Mr Deven, so and so didn't do duty yesterday..." "Oh Mrs Toh, can you ask them to donate $2 to the class fund?" Wanna be responsible boy? Start doing your own Maths homework and handing it up on time first! Hypocrites are those I hate the most...  Oh yes... Have I added that he's a bloody faggot? He flirts with that German student in the class only because he has influence over teachers. Definitely a good person for his re-nomination bid next year. Well kid, if it is a re-election bid, say bye bye to your power, and guess who moves in to your place? Haha... ME! No one supports your "It's against the school rules..." (in a whiny voice) stand. No one ever listens to the feeble and suddenly without a teacher unauthoratative "No balls allowed..."Who is the one who is gaining respect from everyone; the social groups, the uncool people, the smart gang and even the ruggers? ME! You think you got itsy bitsy control over your puny German ally? I kind of think he would want me to be in your place FAGGOT!
