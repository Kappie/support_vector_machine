After surviving Graphics this summer, I've decided to proceed with my plan of taking Compilers  Programming Languages simultaneously, although I'll be taking only 4 courses this time, instead of the full courseload I bore in the summer. Apparently these 2 courses complement each other extremely well  tend to result in massive Eureka moments during the term; should be a nice finale to my undergrad CS career. 
  
Still pursuing my goal of pulling off a double major with English Rhetoric as the other barrel, I plan to take the 1st-year English course that I still need as well as one of the core 3rd-year Rhetoric offerings. Having a 1st-year course will allow me to expend more time on Compilers, which will probably chew up every minute I can spare. I tried to enroll in  Rhetoric: Principles  Practice  (Engl 309A) but Quest wouldn't let me because I am missing the prerequisite, which isn't even offered this winter. However, I have been assured by the prof (Michael MacDonald, whom I had for Semiotics last autumn) that he will let me in regardless so I've selected a dummy 1st-year course (to avoid running into trouble with the administration over tuition)  will switch the courses as needed during my 1st week back on campus. 
  
Right now my schedule has all my lectures on Tue  Thurs but once I do the course switcharoo, some of that will be moved to Monday.
