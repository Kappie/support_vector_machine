Sadly enough, I'm also getting caught up in Magic again (the card game.) Damnit Brian, it's all your fault. We play Magic before and after all of our weekly D games, and my old, tired decks are getting...well, tired.  So I buy new cards. The cycle begins anew. It will control me. I am entering the slow spiral into madness.  -Squirrel
