Then just got up and watched some hawks and once again Tyke's parents were both gone when he woke up.  So he had the house to himself for a while.  He talked to Amed, Tyronius, and Karla for a little while online.  Then Purdy was online too so they chatted for a while and she was talkative with him which made it fun cuz she usually isn't that talkative online.  Then he talked to Haras when she got online and they decided they are going to hang out soon.  That should be fun.  Hanging out with girls is fun.  Anyway the day progressed and Tyke helped his mom put up lights to light the pathway down the side of his house so there won't be any more incidents of Kinker taking a dive.  Later in the night the boys came over.  Amed, Macaroon, Skippy, Dr. Phil, and J-OO-les all made the trip to Party Land.  They of course played Halo.  Amed actually got some kills for once.  How bout the irony in that!  And by kills, not killing his teammate Tyronius.  At least, not that often.  Maybe not even once.  It really wasn't that exciting of a night but it was a long one.  Tyke's eyes are tired.  He is gonna be tired for the big party bash at Dottie's house tonight.  Oooooooo that is in like 18 hours or so.  He's prolly gonna be bombarded with kisses and hugs and just endless amounts of girls coming up to him at the party.  He won't even need to bring the mistletoe his mom bought today.  He supposes it was bought for him but he doesn't really know.  Like at one point she was like, "Oh so you're not going to use it to kiss Macaroon?"  That was a little weird.  Tyke is not gay.  He does not want to use mistletoe to kiss guys.  He doesn't really want to have to use mistletoe to kiss someone anyway.  Whatever, mistletoe shmistletoe...ps if you want Tyke and the mistletoe then let him know.
