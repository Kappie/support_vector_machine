And if u don't, tomorrow can be too late   If you need a hug of a friend...ask her/him for it. Maybe they need it more than you do. And if you don't ask for it today, tomorrow can be too late.   If you really have friends who you appreciate... tell them. Maybe they appreciate you as well. That if you don't and they leave or go far away today, tomorrow can be too late.   I realised we do have alot of differences in our interests and sometimes i wish that we have similar likings. Sometimes i feel that i am unable to influence in the things i like. Most of the time, it's through others that u begin to take notice of what interest me. It's frustrating when i do take an effort to appreciate the things that you like. Why can't u? I'm not saying just becoz of one event which happened but many a times since we were together. Anyway, there are always two sides to every story and this is my side.
