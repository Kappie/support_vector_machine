I came a little bit late and everyone was waiting for me to go to Ariella's house. But, when I finally came, we went to Ariella's house with this dolly full of water balloons. We had a little trouble getting there are first, but we eventually got it (with Lisa's help directing it).  After that, we went to the park and threw the water balloons around. The fun only lasted for a minute, but it was really nice and refreshing. After that, we went back to the house and jumped in the pool for about a half an hour or so and went back in and made smoothies. There were some interesting ingredients in there:
