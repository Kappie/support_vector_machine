She asked me who I thought would make good couples,  she was writing "I (heart) you" on her leg  she wrote "i (heart) you" on my arm  she was leaning on me  ... Ok, so maybe it's not that many signs, and I'm just mis-reading the signs that were there. Oh, and she asked me to the formal next year. Woah... I have three chicks after me! Tara, Emma and now Jess want to go to the formal with me. Or maybe they were kidding.   Or maybe I'm a tool when it comes to things like this...
