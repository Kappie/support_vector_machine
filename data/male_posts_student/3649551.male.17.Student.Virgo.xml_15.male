Now that I've ensuredall the females are reading this ... I'm a doubter. A skeptic. And sometimes I question things. Today I question the vertical placement of urinals in public restrooms. I mean, it's been a while since I've had to stand on tippee toes to do my business, but come on. I don't like to aim parallel to the ground. It ain't natural. That's right, when I urinate I want to go  with  gravity. It's just more satisfying. So why on earth are so many urinals so high up? Personally, I prefer the kind that are set right into the wall. I don't know the correct term, but you know what I'm talking about ... they run all the way down to the ground. This design eliminates most height-related problems and is a much more sensible approach to urination. Automatic flushers amaze me. We take them for granted now because we've got them all over at the high school. But how sanitary: the possibility to go  completely  hands free, for the adventurous types. Okay, maybe I should quit while I'm ahead. I don't know what possessed me to actually post this. But to cut things short, Taco Bell's urinal (singular) is just a bit too high to be comfortable.
