Love letter crumbs on he floor; under the couch; on the couch. Shudder.  I should thank Zel for something she did about 6 months ago... Maybe more. I was hit in the eye really hard by a gala pole. Really hard. We (Fatt, I and Nicholas Leow) were playing with poles and a roll of masking tape. Choir room at Queensway. Oh boy! I was on the floor. Someone ran and got Zel, Zel ran and bought ice. Zel ran back to me in the choir room with the ice in a plastic bag. She sat beside me, whilst I, being the immensely big baby I am with the incomparably high threshold for pain lay there. Just groaning... Pitifully pitiful. I wouldn't call it disgusting. It did hurt.  I have to thank her. Weird how it comes back. The little things. The suttle things. I was special to her. I've got the tendency to feel indebted. I am.  I am.
