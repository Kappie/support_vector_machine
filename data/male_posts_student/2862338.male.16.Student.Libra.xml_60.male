	 
      Ok, sit back, and relax people. cause this is gonna be my longest post to date...a culmination of Friday-Monday....one of the CRAZYIEST weekends i have ever had in my life....   Ok, let's start off with acouple of days ago...with Box City.  What is box city you ask? Well, let me tell you timmy:  Box city is thing thing the antioch people do on the side to help people understand what it's like to be homeless.  It's called Box City cause we all had to bring boxes (though we didn't have to).  Well, ya....MANY, and i mean MANY people couldn;t go, which was sad, but they missed out....and for those that did, here it is, the complete synopsis of how it went from the earliest i remmeber.  And yea, it's basically all gonna be in "parts".    Part 1:  The Beginning  Ok, so the day went pretty crazy.  School was very boring, and the fact that i didn't have a box for the night was messing with my head.  Well, mike was apparently going for his own reasons, so we decided to go to his house to plan out what we were going to do.  Well, we didn't because............ummmmmmmm............shit, i forget, but it's along the lines of "someone is getting us boxes".....yeah, that sounds about right....anyway, ya.  um, so i get home eventually....o yeah! i remember now, my mom was at a tai Chi Lesson (don't ask), and she was going to pick me up at mikes...OOOOOOO, and  JONES  said he had boxes for us...there we go... ok, so yeah, o, and while at mikes, his mom said he couldn't go to box city...which sucked, but ok.  So yeah, i go to Jones' house to go and pick up the boxes....at first everything look perfectly fine, no problems at all....we go into his garage, and the first thing that caught my eyes was the 5-7 Refrigerator boxes....i'm thinking 'FUCK YEAH!!' cause refrigerator boxes are like, the Mansions of Carboard houses.  Well, to much dissapointment, they were off-limits, and i guess i can understand that.....but THEN, he brought me to the boxes he was giving out......they were all like little kitchen appliance boxes, it was crazy, SO YEAH, i get the biggest box, and thank him.....it's not his fault, he tried....anyway, after some debate, i head over to that shopping place where the Food emporium is, and go behind radio shack, and pick up some big ass boxes and shit, it was fucking awsome.  BUT ANYWAY, after that, i head home, and everything went hectic.  I was doing to much shit, but i eventually got there....and whoa....    Part 2:  The Beggining Part 2   so i get there, and the first thing i see is Rob, Chris, Kayci, and Emily.  i unload, blah, blah, blah, then Mike J. tells us to go to the front, where people can see us....so we move all our shit there, and we start building our shit.  um, around that time, Mary beth and sara show up in Mar's car. We set up her's, and mary's boxes, and one extra....whoever got there first, michelle or steph.   Um, ya, so during that whole time, we played cards, have good conversations, and just had a pretty chill time...until...THE NEXT PART    Part 3:  Time-Killerz   OK, so Michelle ended up getting there first, so obviously, the box i so *skillfully* made was hers.  Ok, now lemme see if i can remember.....i think we all just started running around, starting random little conversations, um, played some mow-mow, and then, out of now where, a very kind lady, who i'm sorry i didn't catch her name...stopped by with Coffee and Pizza...ya, i thought it was a pretty bad combo too, but hey, it was still an amazingly sweet gesture.  So, not wanting torisk the posibility of me throwing up, i ended up taking the Coffee.  Ok, so what happened next? well, Michelle went to her box for a while....she was alittle  out of it if you know what i mean...so yeah, and the rest of us just ended up having a pretty intresting conversation...and by intresting, i mean conversations where i can express what i know, feel, or think about a subject....the subject? Dreams of course....i don't know what my addiction to them is...i mean, i want to have SO much more than i know of....My main goal is to become a  Lucid  dreamer...basically, being able to recoknize that i'm dreaming with out waking up, and pretty much be able to do whatever you want....i've been close....very close, i acutally think i did it once, but i still want more ya know?  Well, anyway, we discussed alittle bit, and eventually we all decided that we should go to our boxes.....O! and at that time, Suzanne went to go Pick up steph at the train station...it was around 10:10 i think.   Part 4:  Fast Times at Hobo-High  so we get back to the boxes, and immediatly we start chillen.  it took sometime to move everything around..you know, cause we were going to make a circle in which we all face each other, pretty streight foward.  Well, ok, so i think some time goes back, the jokes here and there, you know, the main stuff.  O, i must mention kayci, emily, and dan G. weren't part of the circle, they decided to go off to the side, where no one could talk to them.....well ANYWAY.....um, by this time, rob went in his box, and NEVER came out....he was the first one to hit the hay in the circle, leaving just me and Chris the only guys left in the circle....well, ok, so, ya, um, during that whole thing, we were just having random conversations.....and, during one point, well, most of it acutally, michelle was complaining about her box, and how her ass was juss to big, and she really couldn't do anything.  Juss to tease her, i kept on saying how my love box (my box had four names: Steve's Box-o-Love, Box city number 4 i think, the centipede, and some chick parmagiana thing rob made up...) was awsome, and how confortable it was....well! there came a time when i had to leave to go to the bathroom, and the girls minus Marybeth decided that was a perfect time to enter my box...lol, it was acutally pretty cause i ran down there, KNOWING they were gonna do that, but they started as SOON as i got out, so i literally saw them go in.....well, i decide to let them do it, and when i come up, i see that, indeed, Steph, Michelle, and Sara had ALL stuffed themselves in my box-o-love.  Well, since i new they prolly gonna take alittle bit of time, i decided to get into Michelle's box juss to see what all the fuss was about....and HOLY SHIT, that shit was the biggest piece of shit box i have ever been in...i ashamed myself buy even helping to build it, so when the ladies got out, i decided to tell Michelle, that if she wanted to, she could sleep in my box, (and no, i wasn't thinking with my dick...she goes with someone anyway, so let's not go there....) and she took me up on that offer.  So, i mean, at first, it was pretty streight foward....we did the whole, backwards-fowards thing, like her feet where by my head, and vice versa.  Well, already, i hated sleeping like that, so i was feeling kinda weird, but then she eventually turned around so we were face to face.  You see, wha happened was, sara, for some reason i forgot, began to gave me an AMAZING hand massage...i'm talking COMPLETELY incredible and message here....it was awsome...so yeah, i tried to get smilez off of people, and it worked, but what was funny was, that michelle didn't know what was going on, so she would always ask whats going on right? well, NO ONE could understand her, let alone myself who was in the same box!  so yeah, she eventually turned around after acouple of us told her she's missing out.  Anyway, at this time, steph get's into it, and we make it a  "competition" to see who has the best one....well, ya, sara gives me one on my right, steph on my left....sara one, but i think only cause she's used to it....stephs was still good though.  anyway, ofcourse, the thought of "how ever will you pay us back" came up...so, back massage came up..well, when sara and michelle went to the bathroom, and steph was left, i decided to go on with the back massage....and yes, this further planted the fact that everyone thinks were eventually going to hook up...well....i dunno.....more on that further down....well, yeah, sara and mich came back, but sara didn;t want one, and by then, my trying to message got me tired....so i just got into the box....after that, we listened to my Ipod some more (which i forgot to mention above, sorry) and just chilled.   So yeah...that went on for awhile, and, yeah, just little random stuff in between.  This kid kept on calling michelle, and causeing some drama, which was pretty funny.  See, she didn't have good reception, so everytime she picked up, she was like "hello?? Hello?!?" like 10 times, than hung up....that happned for awhile...but eventually stopped....but what happened after that you ask? lemme tell ya...   Part 5:  Confession from a box  Alot of random shit happened between that.  Um, it's kinda scarmbled cause we were all trying to go to sleep.  You see, by this time, Chris was knocked out, and snoring in these wierd ass patterns and shit, so we kept on laughing and shit.  Well, ya, so me and michelle were basically just chillen in the box...at one point Steph got in the box, which was VERY intresting....lol, ya, it was a threesome in the box...but evetually, she decided that she couldn;t be in there any longer, and then she went back to her box....but how did i feel about being in the box with michelle? allow me to indulge you...Let me just start off by saying i think Michelle is just amazing, simply put.  She's everything i'm looking for in a girl...minues the smoking part, but i even look over that, she's completely incredible.  And yeah, if that makes you think that i like her, i guess your right...but i'm definitly not trying anything...she already goes out with someone, and i dun even think she like me back...all i'm trying to say is that Michelle is definitly my type.  AWSOME, AWSOME person.  playful, funny, pretty damn good looking, older, i mean, shit i could be here for hours.  But yea, now that i got that off my chest.  Nothing really happned in the box.  I could have started convo's and shit, but then everyone would have heard, so i couldn't really talk about anything. We always moved around and shit, that was *fun*....it was kinda hard to sleep when you have someone else in the same box and shit...well, yeah, that was pretty mch the whole time. The only other thing i could mention was the way she was acting.  I know she goes out with someone, and i know she knows that i know, thats why it was alittle unconfortable.  I noticed acouple of times she was gonna put her arm on me or something, and then she didn't do it...which i completly understand....but all i'm saying is, i would have thought NOTHING of it, and it would have been a HECK of a more confortable time.....but as for  thoughts about it, i mean, what can i say. It was my first time sleeping with a girl....not romatically or anything, but ya.  And i gotta tell you...i mean, on the outside, it's not a big deal and everything, but now that i think about it, its like whoa, i  slept  with this girl....lol, kinda get's a smile on my face..lol, but ya, good times...  I guess a very easy way of explaining how i felt during the whole thing is to listen to the first part  of  "Overkill" by Men At Work.  I completly sums it up...well, atleast the First verse.    Part 6:  The Next Morning...  So, this was the worst part of it all....first off, i didn't really get alot of sleep, so that was bad, you see, i woke up to just about every voice i head that night, and seeing how basically sara was up all night, so was i....well, yeah, anyway, whem i woke up the first time in the morning, it was now raining pretty hard...nothing serious, but more that it was....i do that "mm, dammit" noise, and look up.....Apparently Mike J. saved all our stuff by convering our stuff with cardboard and shit...thanx mike....anyway, while i looked around i notice some blus liquid coming through.  It was litterally three inches away from me and michelles faces....   i think by this time, after alot of random things, Chris wakes up (finally) and mentions that it's already 6:20....we only had to be there until like 6, so..WE WERE DONE! at this time, everyone notices the blue shit, and unfortunatly, my ;illow soacked up most of it...and so did michelles....along with her $300 dollar north face...sorry bout that..anyway, turns out, all that decorating with robs  black marker, was acutally  blue.  so, um, yeah.  Well, we eventually all got out of the boxes, and fixed our shit together, and began collapsing the boxes.  Some ladt stopped by with her pick-up, and offered to help us bring all the boxes down to the dumpsters.  Well, we loaded it all up, then ran down back around back, and unloaded it.  By this time, i called my mom to come pick me and rob up....see, it was a pretty miserable day...so, we really wanted to get away.  Well, after that, mike asks us if we wanna go to the diner, and eat breakfast, but i said no, cause my mom was already gonna pick us up...Chris had left by then, and Dan G. had been gone since 5 that morning...so yea.  Now that i think about it though, i really should have gone,  but coulda-woulda-shoulda i guess right?  So yeah, we drop rob off, and then me and my mom headed over for some quick eats at mcdonalds.  I got back home, brushed the teeth, ate, changed clothes, and juss collapse on my bed...softly smiling thining about the simply awsome time i had...till i woke up that is....   Part 7:  The New Adventure.   Ok, satuday was kinda a blur to me now that i think about it, but i'll try my best.  I know i woke up pretty late.  I think andy called once, and so did sabby, but thats all i remmeber.  I mean, nothing much happened in the time i was at my house.  My mom went to go do the laundry or something, and O! at that time, i realized my Dads car has a flat, which sucks...but more on that later.  Well, ya, during that day, Jorge randomly calls, asking me if i want to go to Hernie's house to jam, (this goes back to the antoch thing) so ofcourse, i was like "hell yeah".  i mean, no one else said anything was going on, and Rob cancelled the Party. (You see, we were going to celebrate the aniversery of the ghetto Super Heros, but he was just to tired, so he moved it back...we have YET to have it...) So, jorge showed up, and i loaded up my gear.  I get there, and it was pretty strieght foward.  we started jamming, and all that shit, i mean, it was kinda slow at first, but eventually it started to get alittle more instresting.     Part 8:  Wait, whats going on?  Ok, so we jam, i mean, nothing big about that....i mean, i guess the only thing i could say is it was good to just get together and jam like that.  Well, after that, Sabby get's there, i learn Scott is coming, and yaneris get's home too.  By this time, we all juss started chillen, nothing big...i was getting pretty damn tired, and, ya.  We eat chinese at some point, but i forget exactly when....i think before sabby got there.  Eventually, Yanaris sends us out to rocky's deli, and we obey, and head over...we get some stuff, than came back..  Acouple minutes after that, we got a call, and scott was there..now, earlier, sabby wanted to go over to eastchester to go visit judith, jorge's G/f.  Well, after making some calls and shit, we decide to acutally go ahead, and go to eastchester.  Well, ya, after some  debate, we start on our way..we decide to take the van he had.  But that ended up being crazy too.   Part 9:  Houston, we have a problem...  So, yeah, at first, i was like, drop me off home....so we go to my house, and drop off my shit...i stay for a bit, and decide to go with the guys (i was VERY tired by the way).  My mom acutally stops by, and we say hi and waht not.   But yeah, after that, we were on a epic quest to find gas....and GOOD LORD did we have trouble.  We ended up going back to hernies, going online to see waht gas station is open, and all that shit.  Anyway, Scott and jorge check it out, it was cool, and soon enough, we were on our way...me more tired than ever.  But ya, eventually, we fixed the problem, and soon began.   Part 10:  Holy shit this is alot...  Ok, we finally go..we stop by 7-11, and go on the long, trechurus (i know i spelled that wrong....to tired to fix) and we finally get there..so random shit happend in the car along the way, convo's and stuff, but nothing worth really mentioning.  We finally get there, and it's like, 4-5 oclock.  We just basically talked..nothing more...there was no reason to be there at all, but we where there.  anyway, after blowing off about an hour, we start heading home, and yes, the suns coming up....we get home at aroun 6-30...stay up till about 7, when everyone kinda woke up again, and then i got dropped off back home for some more sleepage... It was MADE fun though....only problem was that i was working on VERY little sleep....staying awake pretty much all of box city, and then staying up all night and day took it's toll.....i then got home and finalyl slept.   Part 11:  Sundays rolls around.  So sunday came...it was suppose to be a big day ya know? I had my first talk, so i was kinda nervous, and i mean, it was just suppose to be fun.  hernie and Jorge were going on a double date, and were going to miss it, but it's cool, no big deal.  So yeah, that day i pretty much stayed home....slept late and what not, and i think somethign else happned, but pretty much was at home.  Steph once again comes and gives me a ride...so i was pretty thankful for that.  Well, she picks me and sabby up, and we head over to the church.  We had some time to kill, so we stopped by the pizza place for some food.  After that, we head down, and by then, most people are there.  I wander around, just going here and there, and eventually i start chillen at a corner with rob, joe, adn some others when Suzanne and Mike said there was some money missing...now i juss think thats about one of the worst things i have ever heard....i mean, this money, about 50 bucks, was going to help people in africa with thier water situation, and some fuck head goes along, and steals like 38 bucks from it.  really fucked up....and just acouple of minutes ago i got a email from Suzanna saying someone stole her Wallet too...seriously fucked up shit to do to some very very nice people.  Well, yeah....um, i mean, we sat down and i did my talk....and just if you missed it, i'll post it up right now, just to show you:      The Talk   Love. The four little letters that has done so much on this earth.  All it is is  2 vowels, 2 consonants, and an endless supply of meaning.  Dictionary.com defines it as;  “A deep, tender, ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude toward a person, such as that arising from kinship, recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.”  But what is love? Can we really define it? How can you describe when a person is so utterly perfect in your eyes, and you to them, you can’t stand to be a minute away from each other, when you’ve met someone for 3 seconds, and it’s felt like 4 years, how do you describe that gut feeling, that “thing” about him/her, the feeling of absolute love.  Well, I know I can’t describe it, but I can sure say it, and I’m sure many of you say all the time.  Think about your first love….wasn’t it amazing?  I mean, just the whole “knowing you mean something to someone other than your family” is so beautiful.  And even if you never went out with that person, it’s still a great thought huh? Love is a beautiful thing shared by 2 people who, well, love each other! I mean, it doesn’t get any better than that, 1+1= 2 right?  When your in love, you can say whatever you want, you can go anywhere, do anything.  I’m sure it’s different for everyone, after all, I think Sly and the Family Stone said it best when they said “Different Strokes for Different Folks”. But, I think I can speak for most of the guys in here when I say that when a guy is in love, he’ll will do anything for his one and only…as stupid as we may act, as mean as we might seem, if you think we were checking out some waitress at Applebee’s, and our excuse was that we thought she was going trip, so we were just making sure she got into the kitchen safely, we love you unconditionally.  We’ll go out of our way to make you happy, we’ll try to make you laugh, cook your favorite meal, dance to songs we absolutely hate….anything to see that amazing smile, that absolutely infectious laugh, that undeniable beauty.  You could be covered in mud, smell like something an elephant pooped out, and have no teeth for some reason, and you’ll still be beautiful.  You’ll have us in such a grasp, all we can do is listen to love songs, and think about you every second we can.  You’ll put a smile on our face, you’ll make our hearts pump, and our biggest challenges seem like a playschool game, our most difficult hour a little less difficult.  We can be working out, on a Ship, bound to Thailand, with 3 bucks in our wallets, NO way of getting home, and we think some old lady is trying to seduce us, and we’ll most likely think of you….that one person……the one we probably love more than our parents, that one girl, the one that makes us say “I Wish I met her later in life, because I know I want to marry her as soon as possible.”  The one we can be quiet with; the one we can be loud and obnoxious with.  The one we can slow dance with, the one we can break dance with…the one that knows us better than ourselves, the one we know better than ourselves.  The partner in our lives that is so significantly loved, it makes us cry just by acknowledging that fact.  We’ll Love you as long as we know you’ll Love back.  It doesn’t get simpler than that.  And even though a lot of guys don’t feel that way, most of us do, we just wanted to let you ladies know if you didn’t already.      Ok, now, what did I just say? No, really?  Well, if you break it down, you’ll find that one thread went through that entire speech.  And no, it’s not “love”….well, kind of.  Think about what I was saying, all about the relationships and stuff.  What I basically said was that to be in love, someone has to love me back, like, there has to be a 50-50 to share love.  And as much as that makes sense, it’s kind of cutting love short.  As Jesus saw it, We don’t need to be loved to love.  This is where Regular ol’ Lover love, and Christian love Separate Each other. Christian love is different, and may have some getting used to, but when you think about it, if everyone loved the Christian way, this World would kind of be a nicer place.  Jesus said that “It is a deliberate act of the will to love someone regardless of how you feel or how they act toward you.  Jesus taught us to love without any conditions, without any limits, without demanding anything in return.  Now yes, that may be kind of hard to do, especially in this day of age, but when you look at the life of Jesus, you’ll see that love is the least we can do for one another.  He sat and ate with a tax collector.  He showed compassion for the woman about to be stoned for adultery. And perhaps greatest of all; He laid down His life for us and then, to top it off, he forgave those who ridiculed, tortured and killed Him.  I mean, can you imagine? It may be hard for us to grasp such a concept, but, this is how it should be shouldn’t it?  Now, yes, I’m sure your still saying “I want to, but I can’t.” well, yes, it’s hard, and perhaps maybe that’s what the test Jesus left us.  Well, St. Paul knows a thing or two about love too. I have a reading: Love is Patient and kind; it is not jealous or conceited or proud; Love is not ill mannered or selfish or irritable; Love does not keep a record of wrongs; Love is not happy with evil, but is happy with the truth.  Love never gives up; and it’s faith, hope, and patience never fail.          Beautiful isn’t it?  Well, when you put your name in place of the word love, the words themselves take on a bigger meaning.  I’m going to read the passage again with my name replaced for the Word love….while I’m reading, substitute my name for yours….   Steven is Patient and kind; he is not jealous or conceited or proud; Steven is not ill mannered or selfish or irritable; Steven does not keep a record of wrongs; Steven is not happy with evil, but is happy with the truth.  Steven never gives up; and his faith, hope, and patience never fail.  You know, this passage was the first passage I actually liked in the bible.  When we all got our Bibles during the retreat, that was the first thing I turned to, when I went home, I memorized the page number, and highlighted it just to know I had found it, that’s why when I was approached to give this talk, I was very pleasantly surprised.  But when you put your name in, it changes from what love is, to what a Christian should be.  There almost like guidelines one most follow to truly be a good Christian.  Well, when I was reading the “new version” of the passage, something really stood out to me.  The “Steven is Patient and kind” line (yes that did rhyme.  The reason, you might ask, is simple.  I am not usually kind to my family.  My friends, sure, I can be the nicest guy you’ve ever met, but my family is different.  You see, I have 3 other brothers….2 older, and they don’t live with us, and 1 younger, who obviously, still lives with us.  You see, my younger brother has been falling lately in just about every aspect of his life.  He’s grades are poor (that’s a lot better than I can say about mine) and he’s always getting into trouble.  I’m pretty sure he’s been smoking, and probably still does, and I bet he’s gotten drunk before too.  Did I mention he was 13? Well, yes, and with all those things happening in his life, I can’t help but acting very aggressively towards him….not kind at all….and it’s not that I don’t love him, quite the contrary, I love him as much as I love everyone else in my family, it’s just that I can’t respect what he’s doing….sure, I’m sure all of us at some point have done some illicit things, but It’s different when you know your sibling is doing it, and that he/she is pretty young.  Well, because of this, I don’t act kind to him at all, and patience? Forget about it, I think he annoys just about everyone in my immediate family, especially my mom.  You see, my father, a mechanic, knows a thing or two about driving (he’s been doing it since he was about 11), and my little brother knows this, but one day my dad objected to my mothers driving methods, and began to criticize them, this in part made my little brother question everything she does in the car, which is VERY annoying, and when I drive, it’s worst.  This definitely tests my patience, and when I read the “new version” of the passage, it made me realize, I’m a very patient person to everyone else except my family, more specifically my younger Brother, which is kind of ironic, cause I’ll bother him just to see what he’ll do, and that has giving him a lot of patience towards me, and my dad? Same thing, I keep on asking things for my car that he bought, and by now, I’m sure he’s just gotten used to it.  So why Not show the patience I show everyone else?    Well, other than that line, another line caught my eye, “Steven is not ill mannered or selfish or irritable”…now, most of you that know me well enough know I can be VERY ill mannered, these people include rob, Jorge, Mike, Sabby, and Andy, just ask them, I’m sure they’ll come up with something.  Well, yeah, I mean, now that I think about it, I’m those things just about every other day, and to tell you the truth, I don’t think I really like being like that sometimes…I usually act ill mannered when I’m with friends.  Like, I’ll make fake fart noises, or go around doing random things, anywhere I feel like it’ll get a laugh.  And as for irritable? I can get seriously irritable, even if people haven’t seen me.  There’s ton’s of stuff that irritate me, and I know that’s a problem and I really want to fix that.  There are a lot of examples I can give, but I won’t, because that would just irritate me, and that’s what I want to fix.  I seem to be a perfectionist in the game of life, and it just can’t be like that.  It goes back to me having more patience.  And how do I treat my friends? I think pretty darn well.  I mean, I think it’s safe to say that in my close circle of friends, we all feel like brothers.  I mean, I can pull anyone of them, and say what I want, do what I want, think what I want to. And that’s very important to me.  That’s why I always want to go out with my friends, old, and new, that’s why I want to share as much time as I can with them.  Many of my new friends here at Antioch are leaving soon, and I feel that we should all have as much fun as we can before everyone goes.  I think just the thought of that shows the true love I have for friends, that’s why my commitment during the retreat was to “Be More committed to Friends”, I mean, when you think about it, if a person isn’t a family member, their most likely a friend.  And I for one and very thankful that god put me on this earth to meet every single one of my friends, and new friends to come.  I thank him for allowing me the opportunity to share my life with someone else, for giving me people to talk to, to relate to, and to just have fun with.    Well, here I am, last paragraph. So much to say, yet nothing is coming out.   I guess the main idea of this talk is to understand that the Love Jesus Wanted us to share was for a reason, imagine if all of us loved each other the way Jesus said we should, this world would really be an Eden wouldn’t it?  And, I know there’s probably some of you thinking, no one loves the Christian way, it’s just to hard to live in this world like that.” Well, to that I saw, just look around, look at what Christian love brought us.  It brought us each other, and this relaxing atmosphere where we can talk about anything, adults that volunteer there time, and schools that open their door for us…If that isn’t love, I don’t know what is.   so yeah, i mean, the reading went by with out a hitch....what supised me the most though was the reaction to it. I myslef thought it was pretty decent, but nothing to get in a huff about....but alot of people really liked it, i mean, i got some very nice comments said to me, it was just awsome ya know? made ya feel good inside.... :o) but anyway, i thank everyone, and appreciate the fact that everyone liked it like they did...really means alot...But yea...after that, we did the usual closing and everything...O, i should mention there was ALOT less people than normal, which was nuts, cause at that point, rob said that thats how many people used to go! there was like, tops, 16 people there....outa like 30.  But, ya, good shit anyway, still enjoyed it.  Well, since all the ossining people, plus Sara were the only ones who had off this week, no one went to the diner...i ended up coming home, and Talking to Christina, Stephs Freind, online.  After that, i had to go to sleep, cause the next day i had my ROAD TEST! i was pretty exciting, but it turned out to be a very crazy day.     Part 12:  Today  Ok, today started with me waking up pretty early..my lil bro woke me up while he was getting ready....well, anyway, i get dressed, and wait for my ride outside...i get in, and we go to peekskill for some pracitcing....now lemme juss say, i pulled it off, i mean, it wasn;t perfect, but i think i really did worse than i usually do...but anyway, after an hour and a half after that, i finally take it.  I got this guy Pete, real cool old dude, and i do it.....the test took all of 4 minutes....i get back, a changed guy....i can now drive! lol, i know, it's sooo wierd, but ya, i did it! after that, i head home, to go online and find that jones and the rest of us wanted to chill, so, i was all for it...unfortunatly, i had no car to get there with...my mom has the van, and is going to need the van until tonight, and my dads car has a flat...so yeah.  jorge eventually got the car, and gave us all a ride, even though he had to go to a Doctors appointment...thanx Man.  Anyway, we get there, and we basically watch T.V.  I mean, we tryed watching Red Vs. Blue on the plasma, but it was cut short, cause Mr. Jones Got there, and we had to go back downstairs.  But, i mean, thats all we could do..not enough cars, and not enough money.  so we basically just chilled.  Had dinner, then left...pretty streight foward.    Part 13:  The End.... :o) (AKA: The Lucky Number)  Well, yes, as you can read, it has been one HELL of a weekend.....utterly amazing.  Right now, as i type, my dad is coming home from the airport, and i'm juss chillen.  Tomarrow I'm going to the gym with Steph and the guys...and, yeah, i mean this has just  been amazing....never in a million years would i have thought this would happed.  But i don;t regret any of it....um, i still don't know when i'm gonna do my homework and shit, and i missed acouple of things up there, but i mean, ya....To anyone that juss read that whole damn thing,  thank you , by doing this it shows that you care in some way to read it...whether it be cause your bored, want to know my thinking, etc...thanks...well, anyway, i'm gonna get off now...my dad should be coming home real soon, and i'm damn tired....until the next time....
