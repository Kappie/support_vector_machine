To everyone from Shad: you had all better keep in contact! If we didn't talk all that much at Shad that's all the more reason for talking to me now! That goes double for the PAs and staff.  I'm too tired to write anything more than that right now, and I'm still too sad to write anything good.  Rock on, mofos.  Cheers from my basement - Donut
