Neway, been trying to find rocky the movie's theme song and Hawaii 5-0. Kinda nice aft listening to it after watching shrek 2. Neway Nat King Cole's songs are not bad also. Kinda nice, oh no I am addicted to it man!! Coz it is juz too nice to forgt abt it. Neway, Hope all things go well wif the pyramid game preliminary round.
