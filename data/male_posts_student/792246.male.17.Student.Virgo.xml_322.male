I'm going to New York for a week on the 13th, and I'm going to Israel with Shiranne August 12 through the 24th, just in time for my 18th birthday on the 26th.   Saying I just finished cleaning my room would be an understatement. I just finished a weekends worth of cleaning, reorganizing, and decorating. I emptied, sorted, and trashed boxes and boxes that had been sitting in my closet, and it is now wonderful looking. I cleaned off my desk so I have working space, and I made it pretty and clean. I have my computer, printer, magic 8-ball, and several pictures on it now, which makes me feel special and adultish. I finally got around to putting my prom picture in Shiranne's frame, which is nice.  My shelves have all been reorganized, and some changes have been made. Nothing too exciting. A few new items on the wall. Random pictures of people I found in boxes, including HIGG! Yes, HIGG is now on my wall. And it's the hot picture I thought lost. I have the card declaring my おたんじょうびおめdてとう points, and a baseball card of my sister up. My closet door now has a sign politely warning people of the great white shark living inside it. My TV area has been tidied very appropriately, and it now takes up a minimum of space. Very shiny.  So while going through my stuff, I found a pack of old Red Sox trading cards. I have no idea how old they are, but judging from the players, I'm thinking pretty. It's pretty cool. I kind of wish Ryan was home so I had someone to show them to.  Ryan and MJ are now on my desk. As is the classic Elizabeth in the Frog Hat picture. Good times.  As a reward for doing this, I bought myself Firefly. It's pretty much the shit.  I think my iPod is broken. This may have something to do with me losing it in a pile of crap on my desk for like at least a month.
