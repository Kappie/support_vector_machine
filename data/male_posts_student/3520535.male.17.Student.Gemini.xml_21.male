Similar last names that people call us by. Intelligent and aloof, eccentric and living in a self-imposed exile from the world. He's a latin geek, and I just love language in general though I detest the romance languages offered at our school. we have different tastes but it's our differences that unite us. However I'd never sleep with Stiffler's mom. I much prefer Michelle. Nadia's too tan, but you gotta love the Czech girls. And another interesting thing, I've recently gotten into the Greatful Dead and I found out that Leigh Anne likes them as well. Though she disapproves of my  choice of Eighties new wave. My father is pleased that I am re-discovering his favorite band, so that's good. We never really talk.
