You see, we had these huge, illegal fireworks and me, Kris, and Jubal decided that we should tie 3 together and light them all at the same time. It was great, but  one of them exploded before it went in the air and its explosion was like 2 feet away from me, so naturally, i fell and did one of the those cool roll and then hop up really fast things. Then we all had a good laugh, got in the pool and we are now going to bed.  A real picture of what happened:
