Last few days ... or even hours ago... i am going deeply again God... now think of it... its Shit ... its just crap... why am i doing it? and with my mind so clear... just seems to be going again God purposely... ARGH!!!... haiz... but hope there's still time for me to step out of that firy hell...  Today... i shall have my declaration of War Against the  devil   He is just that tiny compared to   GOD....   i can't even see the devil... today i share declare a war again him... and fight all my way to bring people into the army of God...     If in the past, i have sin against any brothers or sisters ... i seek forgiveness ... and may God have his will done... i would wan to start refresh from this moment onwards...
