The weather was so hot snd sticky yesterday, oppresivly so, and the water was heavenly(so was the flasking) and i am definately doing that again despite all the pollution etc. After all, what is a little fecal coliform when yer having fun? J. dropped off a new bike fer me yesterday, the Raleigh was way to tall, so that goes to a different one of her friends, and i got this kick ass brown schwinn. It is a girls bike, but who cares, an it is the perfect size fer me and i am so excited about, i know i will be taking a long ride on it tonight. Total and completed surprise it was too. Called her up to see if i could hit up her haircut guy fer a trim and she is all, what are you up to tonight, let me finish working on yer new bike and i'll bring it over. I was totally gobsmacked. Last day o class tomorrow, praise be.
