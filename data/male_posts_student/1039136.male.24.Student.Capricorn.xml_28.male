Right now i'm at some odd point where I dont know if i can be serious about relationships. My life has changed a lot, and things have been extremely crazy..but this stands out the most in my past relationships.  Girls have my head spinning anymore..sometimes i just feel sick from it..like when you spin around in a circle till youre all dizzy and shit. I just dont know whats going on..i'm lost in a way..I I HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT I WANT..NONE...i dont know what kind of girl i want...what kind of relationship i would fit into..or even if i CAN be in one at this point in time.  This isnt an attempt at venting or anything..I just figured that maybe if i wrote about it, I would get a better perspective.  I think maybe its that i'm so emotionally beat from all the shit i've been through with girls.. I'm just fucked up..lol It could be that i've hit THAT POINT in my life..the one most guys reach...where I just want to chill, be stress free, relax, and do my own thing.  Eventually I guess I will want something serious..i just dont know.  Guys, Women are evil...dont ever ever ever believe that a girl is simple, pure, or innocent. Those three words are reserved for babies..and nothing more.  Girls always used to bitch to me about "getting played". Lets be honest here...guys, we're just pawns in their game.  Woman's enemy isnt men..their biggest problem isnt men either. Its other women.  If 2 best friends like the same guy..a girl would sell her grandmother, her pet chimp, and her left nipple to get the edge over her friend.  The funny part about all of this is that somehow..in the end...they always make it the GUYS fault. Well ya know what i say about that? FUCK THAT.. thats bullshit.. women arent the victim in most circumstances... Their game just doesnt go as planned, and they turn their guns on the cock they were chasing.  I sit and chill in my room alot..when i'm not lifting or eating or going to class.. I think its just because i want to avoid the drama..i'm beat..i need a fuckin break. I wont get one though, and part of me is OK with that. I love attention from girls..I love how girls want to bone me.  My life on MTv would=ratings lately! Alright enough of the women stuff..bottom line..i dont know wtf is going on in my head..and i won't until the merry go round stops spinning and i get off.  Hmm..lifting..yeah..i've gotten alot bigger..I have started to increase my gym days to four and I take a ton of protein and weight gainer. I'm really pumped about wrestling coming back and it's pretty much my ONLY focus right now.  I just want to look good..and I dont think the girls will complain about that either.    It's friday night..i'm beat..so i'm not going out, BUT..i am going to wal mart...need some dvds..  Oh yeah..and girls..guess what!!! Mating season is on its way again...its almost spring..that means youre going to want to bone even more.  Sign up sheets will be on my door ;) For a good read, check the archives of this journal for an entry about mating season last march i think.  Peace..and happy boning. -John
