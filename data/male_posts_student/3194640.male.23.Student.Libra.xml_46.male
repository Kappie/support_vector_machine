I, unfortunately, did not get to meet  urlLink Ben  or  urlLink Guster  due to time constraints. The show started late (after 8:00pm) and ended late (11:30pm-ish). We had to leave almost immediately after the show. We drove back to Wichita and got home at about 3:00am.   The venue wasn't great and I couldn't take any good pictures (so I didn't) because I was stuck in the back. I had a perfect view of the stage, but could hardly tell who was on it. There was no way to get any closer. I had a great time regardless.  The highlights of the show were when  urlLink Guster  played "Fair" ( Ryan  sang the second verse) and "Not the Same" with  urlLink Ben  and when  urlLink Ben  introduced  Brian  from  urlLink Guster  as  urlLink Rufus Wainwright  then they duetted on a cover of Wham's "Careless Whisper."Oh, and I wasn't impressed with  urlLink Gavin Degraw  at all.  Here's the setlist:   Ben:  Fred Jones Pt. 2 / Zak  Sara / All You Can Eat / Late / Careless Whisper with "Rufus Wainwright" (Brian from Guster) / Philosophy / Uncle Walter / Army / Selfless, Cold  Composed / The Luckiest / Rockin the Suburbs ("Just like Guster's gonna do...") / Steven's Last Night In Town (with drum war) / Fair (with Guster) / Not the Same (with Guster)    Guster:  (Not in order yet) Rock this B**** / Happier / Amsterdam / Demons / Careful /  I Spy / Airport Song / Barrel of a Gun / Come Downstairs and Say Hello / Ramona / Homecoming King ("Back in Kansas City") / Fa Fa    /// Encore with Ben Folds ///   K.C. Masterpiece / Backyard / Boy with the Arab Strap / All the Way Up to Heaven
