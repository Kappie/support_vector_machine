Yesterday I went to the Fermi Lab in Chicago for a physics field trip.  It was pretty cool.  For lunch we went to this restaurant where they take pride in being mean.  It was crazy, though they did have good food there.  On the Fermi Lab grounds there were buffalo, we did not really know why they were there, but they were cool.  I got home from that at 9:30.  Then I spent the rest of the night bullshitting a project, that I did better on that I thought I would.  Well, that is all for now.  See ya
