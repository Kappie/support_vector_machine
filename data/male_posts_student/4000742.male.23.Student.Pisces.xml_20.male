The professor quoted a Sanskrit  shlok  which enumerated five qualities that are desirable in a student so that he may have a stress-free time. These five are:    kaak-cheshtaa  - the persistence of a crow   shvaan-nidraa  - the light sleep of a dog   vako-dhyaanam  - the focus and concentration of a crane   gruh-tyaagii  -  relatively detached from day-to-day and household chores   alpaahaarii  - eating moderately
