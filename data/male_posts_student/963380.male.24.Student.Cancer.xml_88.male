Who really is the stupidest person on the planet? Jason or Jerry?  The video went off rather smartly at work today. After work I came home and promptly fell unconscious. I'm rather energized now at the ripe hour of 11 O'clock, that should last a scant few minutes before I die again.   I'm really starting to enjoy Crystal Light. weird.
