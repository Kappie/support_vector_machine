Anywho, I read up on the bible, a few buddhist teachings, and I read up on judaism to refresh some of the known history of the supposed gods in existance. Though I do admit, Buddha... Siddhartha, whichever you wish to call the great teacher, was not a god as he spoke himself. As I read some things on Christianity I was struck with how stupid and weak the people that the Christian God chose for His work were. The Christian God said I'll do this for you or use you to do my work and they praised God for his power and greatness, a while later they are lying and cheating each other, scemeing, killing, drunk, complaining, worshiping gold cows...the list goes on and on.     They did have their moments of following Gods direction and some never faltered. I guess my point is that we are that way too. Contentment is something that America makes close to impossible. Today I realized that I am a bit more content than I ever have been. Nothing that I could buy could make me happier... well, a new guitar is always a plus in my life... Family, friends, places to use the talents I have, a nice place to live in a call home, my parents (I'll admit they're not the greatest thing since sliced bread, but they're my parents, I love them, even though they can be a bit pestering with their foolish money spending and meaningless debates and arguments), plus I have enough money to support my one and only hobby (GUITARS, GUITARS, AND MORE GUITARS...well, then comes organ/piano/keyboard and I never play keyboarded instruments much)...it's all beyond what I deserve. The promised land for the Isrealites... They complained for forty years before they finally got a place to hang their hats.     The human will always look out for his/her self until failing miserably and turning to someone else. How's the saying go? If at first you don't succeed, try try again. It seems to work with certain things; if you can't throw darts to save your life and you want to be better than practice and you'll get it eventually. The bigger picture, life, doesn't seem to mimick that. The harder we try on our own to be content, the more we fail miserably.  Once you're gone... I suppose there are no worries on politics, religion, money, life, death. It's a different concept... supposedly, but scientifically there is no evidence of knowing.  Some would think that I don't care about all those things, and truthfully, I really don't care if John Doe is Mormon or Jewish or worshipping a statue in is garage. As long as the man who becomes president can do the job and do it right while taking steps forward instead of tripping and falling backwards down a starecase, failing miserably, and turning to someone else (a new president...) for help to fix errors. If I had to eat ramen everyday for the next year I know would make it... I just don't want a greedy foolish president trying to front the entire corporate world... Anybody who is a republican or a conservative can understand me here can't you? Can't we comprimise? Four to Eight  years of a brighter future for your children... eight years of a brighter future for yourself... you got your wish... you got a republican... can't you just please give us a chance? Please... don't you know people are dying out there in Iraq. Every day. So you and your children's children are able to live. And they didn't want to go to Iraq. I, by no means, like the military's unnecessary use of force, but I, by no means, don't want anyone to die if they feel they are not ready to die... You're sending people with families to die in Iraq... and how do you feel about that? They don't want to do... deep down, I know they don't want to go. Just please... do us a favor and help us end it. Together we can do this. We're all in the same boat here aren't we? All we are saying is give peace a chance... come on... you got your war, if you aren't foolish, please don't make it any longer. OK? That's all I'm asking... just for one time consider to be a little more compassionate.  I'm a middle-of-the-road type of person as far as politics go... I try to consider all possible moves and options that are available to my advantage. In my case... I can't vote. And I know why too... there's no way I'm letting some of these idiots my age vote. I just wish politics weren't such a controversial issue... I wish schools were a bit more accepting and had open arms to people who wished to exercise your rights and freedom of speech to speak your mind on political issues. Your child could finally learn something... Most baby boomers grew up throughout the 50s, 60s, and 70s and got to see some of the most important times in American history. Your child may never see anything of the sort, you know. We are seeing a bit of something now and this is going down in the books. But since... I guess, no, no, I couldn't. The French and Indian war... for some reason my mind tells be 1751... or 1763.. I know I'm a few years off... I'll look it up on google when I get a chance, anywho, since we've been known as a country, we've had war. This country was established apon war.  You may disagree with me here, but I say that this country was really founded apon religious tensions with the Church Of England, in 1621 if I recall, when the pilgrims crossed the Atlantic in the Mayflower.  Of course, beforehand there was Sir... aah.. I just had his name in mind... I can't remember... blanked out... AAH!!! ::lightbulb cuts on:: Sir Walter Raleigh... anyway, 1500s, founded the roanoke island colony on Roanoke island, the town is now known better today as Manteo, North Carolina and is a part of the outer banks and Cape Hatteras island chain. I spent about a weekend in Hatteras every month and one to two weeks a summer there up until last year when Hurricane Isabel washed everything away... I knew a lot of good people down there from my age and some up into their 60s and 70s... Rob, Russell, C.E., Nick, Bob... I don't know how they all faired... I haven't been down there since July of 2003... I sure miss those times. I considered Rodanthe, North Carolina and Cape Hatteras to be my true home. Much more than Gloucester, Virginia.  Anywho, getting back on topic... Sir Walter Raleigh was in charge of the colony down on Roanoke Island... highway 158 runs right to it off of I-95 and takes you right to it, if I recall. Of course nobody knows just what happened to Raleigh's colony that mysteriously vanished... I need to move along here since I'm in a hurry.. anywho, there was the whole Croatoan/Croatan and Virginia Dare issue and they thought that Natives killed everyone and destroyed everything and nobody knows what exactly happened on Roanoke Island to this day...  Ok, moving on... Jamestown Island is about 30-40 minutes from here in Gloucester.  That was founded in 1607 ....  This is getting way too long. Plus the news is on channel 10 and I've got to send someone something... I'll get back to this some other time.  Take care,                       George Snow  Music : Crosby, Stills, Nash, And Young TV: Channel 10 local news Mood: busy, happy...
