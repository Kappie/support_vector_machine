Since I'm working with him, I really can't get him a present. b) I get paid from this job, hopefully in an amount exceeding $60. c) I can look at what the girl's friends get her.  I'm looking for the cheapest tolerable gift to give someone for a graduation party, because Kathleen's party is on July 10th, and I need to get something.
