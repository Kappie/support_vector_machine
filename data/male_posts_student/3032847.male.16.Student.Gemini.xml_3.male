TV and DVD recorder- which was a miles better deal than the one we seen yesterday, and if ya work it out we saved Â£400! It's coming today/tomorrow (whatever way you look at it) at 3:00, by which time I will have done this stats exam which starts in 9 hours and I'm yet to revise for..   ...and todays badness? England lost. England lost, but everything could have been different if a certain smack head ref had been a bit more fair during the whole game, and also if THAT goal was ALLOWED :-@  Ste and Kat's battle to outpost each other on my forums has been a kind of amusing annoyance...  Well well well. The day of the LAST exam, and the last time I'll go to that certain council ran gaol until results day. I feel a bit lost. Should I revise or go to bed? I've peeked at a practice exam. Not attending most of the lessons has not helped me, as I don't know a thing. Oh wells. Life will be SO MUCH BETTER in 11 and a half hours time! BED IT IS!  Keywords anyone? Blog weblog hartlepool pools monkey hanger monkeyhanger teen british europen english north east journal diary ...  PS: HOW COULD I FORGET?! GOOD NEWS! MY UNCLE WHO LIVES IN NEWZEALAND WHO I'VE ONLY SEEN TWICE (HE CAME HOME IN '96, I WENT THERE IN '98) IS COMING HOME IN SEPTEMBER! WOOOO!
