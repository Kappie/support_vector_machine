SP Floorball have approached Milo to be a sponsor for their ongoing expansion of the club name to all people in Singapore. With Milo, many people would think about SP Floorball the moment the drink touches their lips. Milo has been Singapore's trusted food drink for sportsmen and sportswomen alike. With this deal, SP Floorball could be seen as a household name in the years to come.  BAd news for Milo fans though. Due to SP floorball's current jersey deal with VONDA and UMBRO other sponsors are not allowed on their jerseys. This is to give the jersey a clean and clearer image and not look like some kind of uniform. But dont be disappointed, for SP's friendly against ITE CLEMENTI all fans are treated to free flow of hot or cold milo in the stands. ENJOY!
