I didn't manage to slp well last nite, but I was still able to get up like 6am. I was supposed to meet 3 other frens at 7:30am, so tt we can get to the place together. In the end the numbers got multiplied by 2 and there were like at least 6 of them. I didn't even noe shitz bout' this. Even Ze Hao had no idea. The meeting place was oso changed and I was onli informed when I was reaching Clementi. I met Ze Hao while walkin to the Mac near the interchange, he obviously had no clue cuz he was walkin to the opposite direction to the place we were supposed to meet. Luckily he spotted me and I was kind enough to tell him tt the venue had changed.  So there were apparently 8 of us when we took the bus to tt RELC, where the seminar was. And of all ppl in the world, my enemy or u can say the person i truly dislike had to be 1 of the 8 ppl. So I pretty much couldn't be bothered, I juz kept quiet all the way. If I knew he was coming along, I wouldn't be there at all. I made this code clear to myself "If he's there, den I wouldn't be there unless it's realli necessary."  The seminar like I said was boring shitz, I dun think I would want to elaborate on it. It was a waste of time and a waste of money. I still can't believe I paid $25 for tt shitz when I could haf used tt money to gamble or to treat some1 to a game of pool. I wasn't paying attention at all thru out the whole thing. I was basically tryin to slp, but when u haf ppl like Benson around, u can nvr fall asleep! Damnit, he kept wakin me up whenever I was this close to slping! Grrr, I think no1 has come this close b4! I hate it when ppl wake me up when I'm hafing my beauty slp, whether it's a phone call or wadeva. So the seminar was like frm 9am - 12pm. I was starving when it was onli half way thru. Time realli "flies" and it ended realli "quick".  I was actually supposed to go to Orchard wif Ze Hao, Sian Yang and Gervais. Tt was all the ppl I knew were going at first. Den I found out poor lil' SY wasn't feelin alrite and had to go home. Nxt I found out tt other ppl were going as well, 1 of them was none other den my enemy. How WONDERFUL! So I had no choice but to follow my code. I could tell tt Ze Hao was pretty pissed when I told him tt I wasn't going anymore cuz I actually agreed wif him way b4 hand tt I'll be going. I dun like pulling out at the last minute, but I tot tt it was for the betta.   Juz to clear things up, these are the reasons why I chose not to go. Firstly, if SY wasn't going den I'll be an outcast if I went, whether they agree anot I dun care, cus this is juz how I realli feel. He's the onli one tt actually does talk to me when we go out together, the rest either do not care or wadsoeva. I simply can't be bothered wif them. Secondly, I had to go wif my code and not break it. No way am I going out wif my enemy, like duh. Thirdly, I rather be wif Anwar than wif them cus both of us do not haf this "communication breakdown" thing whenever we're together. He nvr fails to communicate wif me, whether it's serious stuffs or nonsensical stuffs. This is the kind of person I wanna be wif, some1 I can communicate wif easily. Some1 who will ACTUALLY talk to me and not leave me alone. As for the grp of frens I was supposed to be wif, I juz felt tt I had a communication breakdown wif everi single 1 of them excluding SY and probably WQ. This was why I chose to leave them and go to Jurong East to meet Anwar. I dunnoe wad they think of me, but I dun care. I rather be wif 1 person who I can communicate well wif than a hugh grp of ppl who I haf a communication breakdown wif.  Well, things didn't go according to plan. Anwar couldn't make it in the end cus of some stuffs. Luckily my lower sec clsmate was in the same bus as me, so I juz went wif fate. We went for lunch first, den we went lan gaming for an hour. After tt we went to watch Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban, which was 2hrs long. It was 5pm when the show ended and I made my way home. Amazingly I reached home at 5:30pm, which was surprisingly fast. L0L! Rite now, I'm juz hafing serious thoughts bout' everithing tt happened today. I'm thinkin about who my true frens realli are and I'm realli beginning to see who they are. Unfortunately, I can see tt my frenship wif tt grp of frens isn't going to last long. I kindda see wad's gonna happen, but I'm juz reluctant to accept it. I see tt my frenship wif these ppl after the 'O' Lvls isn't going to last, it'll probably end realli fast. I juz hope tt it wouldn't turn out this way and I juz wish tt they will do smt to prevent it. But tt isn't for me to decide. Tt's for them to think if they wanna continue their frenship wif me. So I'll juz let fate decide, I'll noe when the time cums.  This has been 1 of the most or the most emotional entry I've written. I'm neither depressed nor angry about it, I'm juz gifing it serious thought. But it will probably stay in my head for a pretty long time. And I think I might finally haf a chance to go to KL frm around these dates: 17-21 June. Isn't tt great? Haha, guess tt's it for today. Cya all! And remember, the key to frenship ---> Communication! L0L! Tt's juz 1 of the most important factors, there are many others as well, but tt's all I'm gifing for today. =]
