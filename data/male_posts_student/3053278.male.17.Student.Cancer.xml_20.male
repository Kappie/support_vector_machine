He was a older guy say little older than my parents. One thing about him though was he was smart. Real smart. He beat in the pool also(he beat Hammond too). His technique was awesome and he gave Kopylov a run for his money. I fenced Hammond in the pools. I wanted to fence him so badly that I didn't unleash on him. I lost 5-3 but had a 2-0 lead. I feel kind of eck about it. My first touch I caught him off guard and slashed him right across the chest. Then the next touch my break failed and I caught in the nicest prep. I should have won that bout...But w/e I'll see him next week at the Lilov father's day tournament and then at the Garden State Games. I gonna get mine.
