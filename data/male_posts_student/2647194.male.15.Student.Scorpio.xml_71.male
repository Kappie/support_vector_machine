Saturday night: I can't remember too well, but I think I stayed home.  Sunday: Didn't go to church on Palm Sunday *gasp* The concert was pretty good, although we were missing a few select members of the bad ::cough Jamie cough::. Yeah, and my second-half entry was great. lol  Worked on my paper a bit, did chores, and nothing else this weekend. Plus, this next weekend is Easter weekend, so I don't think I'll be doing a whole lot else other than going to church and homework. hehe like I do homework...  Recap of today:  Math: nearly fell asleep in class-so damn fricken tired...this is why I don't like daylight savings  Science: Test was fairly simple, I most likely passed...like I don't ever not pass?

Spanish: Geez, I think we're really getting on Mrs. Sustic's nerves. During the evaluation of the maps, people kept launching paper rolls around.  Random spanish funny: At the very beginning of class, an unnamed student (lol) propped up 1 of the desks against the door, leaning forward. So when Mrs. Sustic shut the door, the desk fell over.  English: I foresee my paper being 8 pages long...plus 2 page outline...plus 1 page works cited...plus title page UGH!!! 12 pages of junk  Social: Finished up the presentations today with Cal's on Florence, Italy. Test on thursday is going to be a joy.  That concludes the recap.  As for after school today...this weather is awesome. Orchestra tonight, I usually look forward to anything involving music. Even if it is incredibly easy, but hey-I get to play the chimes, which is pretty cool.  Hmm....lets see...  Here's a summery song because its 71 degrees out.  "Blue skies smilin' at me Nothin' but blue skies do I see Bluebirds singin' a song Nothin' but bluebirds all day long  Never saw the sun shinin' so bright Never saw things goin' so right Noticing the days hurrying by When you're in love, my how they fly  Blue days, all of them gone Nothin' but blue skies from now on (Blue skies smilin' at me Nothin' but blue skies do I see)  Never saw the sun shinin' so bright Never saw things goin' so right Noticing the days hurrying by When you're in love, my how they fly  Blue days, all of them gone Nothin' but blue skies from now on Nothin' but blue skies from now on"  -"Blue Skies", Willie Nelson
