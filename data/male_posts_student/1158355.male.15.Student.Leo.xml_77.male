Hi my name is Grandma Fuck Y'all... fuck y'all if ya nasty darling. L to tha I to tha N to tha G... Ling Ling, you forgot your bling bling! Nigga please. Oh god, that was hilarious. Ok, so then we all went to Ricky's house for pool fun. Ricky chased us with a remote controlled jet ski around the pool. That was fun. Uh... then we had to go, Ricky had soccer, we went back to my house and basically did nothing. Then went to Jared's party. We had to pick up Crystal and Nolan. At the party, it was all crazy. I mean in my eyes it was, I was running around psycho. It was fun, but I was the only one going crazy. Kind of boring group of people. Except for a couple of guys who went along with me. Jason, Clement, Kaiser and Stoltz were the only ones going all out. It was still fun though. I mean we had food and shit. That was good. Like brownies, Toni rubbed all the brownies on me. I made a smiley face on myself and named it George. Then I made some mouth music (beat boxing?) for the bball playazzz'zzz entertainment. Then I became an Indian with Crystal, Jackie and Toni, I don't think they realized they were Indians though... sitting Indian Style. Then... uh... I played some game but played too rough and hurt a few girls by accident. It was sad, but then Toni smashed my head with the volleyball so then it was even. So after a hard core party at Jared's, I brought Crystal home, then went home, talked to a few people, played The Sims, went to bed.
