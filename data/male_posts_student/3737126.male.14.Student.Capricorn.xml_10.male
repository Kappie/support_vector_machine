These are the some of the few who visit my blog, and keeps the flame alive in my journalistic acumen.        So, what  did  happen today?        As other Claretians probably did their own projects and most are probably in front of their PC's wasting another 50 pesos or so for their weekly (or rather daily) dose of Ragnarok Online, we were their at our school to serve as the eyes for our school paper. A journalist's job is never done, and so is the webteam's. So Jiggy, TJ and I were at the church, for it was the Claretian Missionaries' Day. Nobleza and EJ was not able to come. EJ had to do his AP project, and Nobleza did not arrive for an unknown reason.
