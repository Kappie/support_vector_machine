Actually, I was lying in bed with the light off and I suddenly got up, turned on the computer, connected to the internet, and started ranting!  The reason I feel crap is because there is so much crap in the world and I have an expectation of myself to fix it all, but I know I never could, which makes me kind of sad.  And because I've realised that I have to find my own 'truth', my own path, because their isn't one just laying there waiting for me.  Life sucks, but it could me so much worse.
