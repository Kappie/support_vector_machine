I have two papers to do for the weekend, my Lit paper about the play Sugar Coated Dreams and my En paper about my revised proposal and thesis statement...  However, I would have to cram them on Sunday (my birthday) as we (meaning to say me and my old high school friends) will be celebrating my birthday tomorrow...  So there...I do hope I do well plus there is of course the burden of doing exercises in our calculus book in preparation for the dreaded second long test in Math 21...  I do hope everything goes on fine though...  There...
