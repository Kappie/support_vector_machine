As I have previously stated, I own McDonald's. They come to me. 5. I do not have a husband to beat on. 6. I have never been to Crispy Cream. 7. The "all" in the sentence, "The boys are all tired." is an ADJECTIVE. Sit down, I am right. And good luck on your SAT's.  8. My statements are verifiable, yours are ridiculous.   -Just don't speak anymore Dustin, you're embarrassing yourself.
