If you've never had one, go run now, straight to the nearest Wendy's!!! So yesturday I decided that since I had the time, Tasha was gone otherwise I would have been talkin to her the whole time, I decided to take my pistol out...I got the red dot sight correctly sighted now and I have shot around 200 rounds through it already, it will hold 7 rounds and fire them semi-auto but it is supposed to hold 10, if more than 7 are loaded the damned thing would misfire quite a bit, but I dont mind that cause the gun is powerful, accurate, and just down right sexy...then i talked to Tasha fora while and then went back to doing basically nothing... I decided that I would take all of my games off of my pc and do some virus/spyware scans, came up clean so I defraged my harddrive as well...oh yea, sometime in there I had the time to try to mess with Fedora Linux for a bit but couldn't do too much there...and so my next big idea now is to start a website or two, if anyone wants to help me out with this then please get a hold of me, I'll prolly make one that wont be updated too much and then another that will be mostly about overclocking and computer things such as reviews and all...the first one shouldn't take really any time at all but the second one is gonna be quite a bit harder, I want the pc site to look nice and proffesional, but my site I wont really care too much about...well its about time for me to take a nap, I'll prolly end up puttin up another post later on today...
