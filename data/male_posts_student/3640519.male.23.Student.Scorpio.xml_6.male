But, nevertheless, it was better than the usual stuff which comes from the Bollywood stable. A little senti, with some often heard, loud-mouthed patriotic dialogues. Anyway I thank god it wasn't a one man show. PZ looked eminently delicious as always. Well today I seem to have been overwhelmed by an unusually potent bout of drowsiness. Hard work keeping my fingers at work hovering over the keyboard. Its hot in the lab,  the AC is not on. I think I will give my grey cells a rest and flick the AC on.
