I filled up a form with all my personal particulars and later went to see the manager. The manager say that he will call us back.He was quite a nice guy He did call us on the following day. Today, i went for a briefing. I did not really like the job they were offering us. My frens and I rejected the job. Later we went to raffles city to eat at subway. It was already 7 plus. Subway is the best fast food restaurant. It is even better than Mc Donalds and KFC. The food is also healthy but i bit expensive. Singapore should open more branches. Later made our way to Far East Plaza to look at clothes. I wish I got money. I really want a job.
