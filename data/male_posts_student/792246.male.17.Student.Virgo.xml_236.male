It works by transmitting the audio wirelessly onto an unused radio station, allowing you to listen to your iPod in the car or at home without big clutter. Clutter is no fun.  It works, the audio quality is good(as long as you don't put too much distance between the transmitter and the iPod), and you can create custom radio stations for your friends who live within within like 10 feet of you. Just think:  Now I can use my iPod as my alarm clock. I can trick people into thinking I found a station that plays The Pillows. You can blast music from your car in a new way!  So, that paper I thought I would get an A on? I got an A. 49 out of 50. Hah. The only reason I didn't get full credit is I didn't list any  positive  changes to the fast food industry in the last 30 years. Well Mr. Hippy, if I had thought you were anything but a crazy liberal who gives off the impression that you want me to think that there were  no  positive changes, I would have gladly gone into them. I thought 6 pages of what you want to hear would be want you want to see. You always throw me surprises. I love you.  Have I mentioned I love him?
