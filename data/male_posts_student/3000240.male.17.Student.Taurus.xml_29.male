Went funkily although it seemed to last forever in there. Anyway when we left it was about 4 in the morning and we all drifted around Camden (not as dangerous as I had thought it would have been) until daylight and the first buses came. Anyway got to Hammersmith about 7 and then got home via the tubes and whats not. Once I slept it all of I called Anna about the obscure film festival we were planning to go to on the Saturday night, but she never turned up, and that's when my bad luck started. Well it's a lot easier for me to list it so her you go:  1. Couldn't get change a 10 pound note to call Anna from anyone 2. When I eventually did the phone booth didn't work 3. Train delayed back to Waterloo 4. When it started I learnt I was on the wrong train 5. Then cunningly (I thought) I'd get of at bank and get on the waterloo and city line but as soon as I got to the platform I learnt it was shut. 6. Got to Kennignton but missed train just and had to wait 3 quarters of an hour for the next one 7. Got to Waterloo, and called Anna but she didn't pick up 8. Had to wait for 3 quarters of an hour for the train to Kingston 9. When I eventually got to Kingston I had to wait for an hour for the 411 10. Eventually got home to a bollocking from my parents.  Hooray gave me new hope for suicide.  xBuBzx
