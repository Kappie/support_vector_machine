But, I went to the movies tonight with  Sid ,  Bryce ,  Armando , and  8-10 other random people  from MHS and watched  Alien vs. Predator . The whole theatre was packed since it was the opening day. The movie itself was alright, it kinda leave you hanging so I'm expecting an  Alien vs. Predator 2 . Check it out, I think you might actually like it.
