For the first time, I didn't dare bored the bus regardless of whom my enemy is on it. I just flash a standstill and waited for another. Crossing down the alley into a stop as I gaze upon a sight of my cousin, vignesh. Walking together and sharing mindset of each other's problems. It's been a long while since we shared open topics. The route to school got diverted once Ernie got me a call in pleading me to wait for her, she was late. The chat between me and vignesh blossomed and I sincerely know how she finally feels. The day was fine and the spirits were quite low. Corey was sick and he had to go home. Message him twice to take care and to visit the doctor. Hope he does so, his got a match tomorrow. And hope his feeling better.
