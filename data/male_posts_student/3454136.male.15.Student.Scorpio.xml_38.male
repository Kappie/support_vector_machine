Anyways, my blog is officially Member's Only for comments. I might change it back if enough people message me or e-mail me about it on MSN...  I finished my math unit test yesterday and my civics unit test today :). Now, there won't be anymore math hw so I just have to review till the exam... Aww, I don't remember ANYTHING about analyctic geometry and trig... I got a lotta work ahead of me... I'll just study the last day :). As for civics... stupid summative project thingie and final in-class exam r still left... DAMN IT!  As for my other two classes... I'm more or less failing 'em. Gym is one of those things I have no chance of even getting an 80 on... If u saw me doing beep test, u'd prolly think I have asthma or something. Which I don't. And English...  I WAS getting 90's in English until recently... Well, yesterday... I got back 3 assigments... The marks were 65, 67, and 75... Sigh, I'm a efing idiot... Along with my gym mark, that means I'll barely get a low 80's average... Which is BAD. No, not bad, just HORRIBLE. I'll just die! I need at least a mid 80's. Prefferably high 80's or low 90's. Wah! I felt like dying after english class...  Oh well. I swear, even though it's time to study like mad, I've actually amped up my video gaming... I'm just terrible, aren't I? I got myself into this situtation and I'm too lazy to even try to get out of it...  Oh, and I realized soemthing. I dunno whether this means that I can't blame people for hurting me anymore but I've realized that I bring the best and worst out of people. My meek, pathetic, unassertive personality with no trace of self-confidence seems to invoke specific feelings from those around me. They will automatically do one of two things unconsciously. Either A, Take absolute control of me and push me around. The people that get these feelings will make fun of and sometimes physically abuse me. They will force me do things to help them, which is in my nature to do. On the other hand, B, Take pity on me and help me as one would take on a project of taking care of a stray dog. The people that get these feelings are, although rare, absolutely crucial to my survival. They will seemingly help me selflessly but is likely to expact something back from me, which I am over-willing to give.  U c, my very existance influence the way people treat me... So, does that mean I can't blame them? Who nos... I gotta take a shower, cya.
