No, Mike, if you look a little deeper into all the posts I've made in this thread, you'll probably notice that the total word count vastly surpasses  3 . Bush ignored briefings, yes, as did Rumsfeld, Ashcroft and (most of all) National Security Advisor Condi Rice. And they didn't just ignore briefings. Look back a little, and you'll surely notice that I mentioned a few other things they ignored.  You asked me earlier, "You truly and honestly believe that 9/11 could have been prevented?" I responded in the affirmative. Then you said "Don't tell me there was some sort of way we could have prevented 9/11."  What do you want, Mike?!?  You ask me a yes or no question, I tell you "yes," and then you tell me not to tell you yes. What is your problem here? I'm not answering the way you want me to answer, obviously, but is there some other problem?  Remember the first post you addressed to me? Here's a little quote from it: "I make no attempt to be fair, objective, or open to your ideas. I believe you are fundamentally wrong on almsot every issue, given your previous posts. I seek to convert you, not to form some sort of consensus or compromise."  So what are we doing here then, huh? You're not converting me because I'm too well-read on the issues to vote for Bush or any other conservative. I'm not converting you because you outright said that you aren't open to what I have to say. This is becoming more and more clear, though there is a difference between 'not being open to my ideas' and 'shitting all over the facts that I present.'   The way you talk to me is the same way Bill O'Reilly talks to his non-conservative guests, only I'm able to complete my statement  before  you can rush in to obscure it.
