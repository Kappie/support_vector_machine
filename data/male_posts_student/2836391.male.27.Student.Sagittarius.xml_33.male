Shoes are shoes, and skates are skates, and this is the way it should remain. This genetic modification of footwear sets a dangerous precedent. Where will it all end? That is my question, where  will  it all end? But seriously, I look forward to watching  urlLink Rach's  adventures on these shoes, and since I almost broke my foot while on a pogo stick at Christmas, perhaps I should temper my mocking.  In other matters, I feel that the youth who delivers my newspaper and I will shortly come to blows. The consistency and accuracy of the deliveries is sketchy at best. Whole weeks will go by without a single paper being delivered. This week is a case in point. I should receive a newspaper on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Tuesday, I felt as Old Mother Hubbard must have on reaching that celebrated cupboard, as when I got there, the paper was where? Not to be found at all. On Thursday, yes, I did receive a paper, and then tonight, he or she outdid him/herself. Not one, but two copies of the Friday edition. Perhaps on the assumption that I should get three papers a week, and I  did  get three papers, so we must be all square. Since it is a free newspaper, I suppose I shouldn't really complain, but still, it is the principle of the thing. I also suspect that this same youth is delivering my Wednesday free newspaper, as this only arrived yesterday evening, and in other weeks has been conspicuous by its absence.   Here endeth the ranting
