But basically, I'm about to find out how much one person can take before he just shuts down.   Come spring pops show Wednesday at 7:00.  It's the only chance you'll get to see my hip and trendy disco attire.  Trust me, you don't want to miss it. My pants are tight and flair at the bottom.  It is most humorous. When things cool down and I have time, I'm gonna get my new blog up.  It will contain most humorous recaps of my life, leaving this blog for more intelligent discussion.  Things cool down around May 30th, btw. No.  The title makes no sense.  Don't ask.  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.
