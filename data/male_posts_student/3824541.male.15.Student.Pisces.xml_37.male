I'm not that big of a sports dude, but once in awhile I'll try to watch a game with others (I always get side-tracked). As of now, I live in Shorewood, IL, but I lived in Florida for like 13 years, and before that New York for two years.  I think I'm going to use this for publishing articles and stories I right, as well as, I guess a journal.
