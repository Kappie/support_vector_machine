What was frustrating about the bout was not the fact that I didn't fence well but the fact the eqipment was giving trouble and mer go touches she really shouldn't have. But w/e it's one bout and i'll just from now on have to fence 100% all the time(well actually due to my injuries im fencing about 70%). But I got SAT's tommorow and then the Car Wash. The Wash will release my SAT tension so until then.  I found out about my worst injury.. You may not know this already but i have a pretty high pain tolerance...I pulled my gracilis tendon in the back of my leg and it makes it difficult to lunge and run. It's healing and Vanessa says it will be fine in due time. so good luck to my leg.
