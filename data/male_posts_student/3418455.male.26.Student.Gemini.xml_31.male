Well unknown to me, basically because she never told me, she "stopped" dating me and was doing her thing all over the town while still sleeping over at my place, that is when she wasn't over "somewhere else".  Anyway, time went by and I stopped seeing her all together, THANK GOD!  Well she still had the laptop and my roommate had wanted to borrow it and told him that the psycho still had it.  He got mad and went and got it!!!  He's the shit!  Well just b/c of him I had that computer to be able to let my neice play with and now it's over at sistas house getting used...Thanks Charlie!
