It was one of the best experiences ive ever had just hanging with friends and seeing God come back to this school. We sang songs and danced......p.s. we also threw luis into the air and forgot to catch him(woops). The community service we great b/c me and some other ppl went to the movie theature at Hacenda and interviewed random ppl. It was really fun b/c we went to jamba juice and Best buys after that! After the whole thing, everyone went home and ate their "2nd" meal b/c the beans and rice they gave us were really small. I had tons of fun and hope that whenever we do it again, the ppl who didnt do it (not nameing names) would do it with the rest of us.  Now on to "The Passion of The Christ" which i saw today with my school. My first thought was that it was really gory but when i thought about it, ppl dont realize how much Jesus did for us by being beaten and crucified. They read it in the Bible and say, "O yeah he died for us....wow great thats good for him." People also see on paintings that Jesus had like 4-5 red marks in his body but in real life he was flogged/wipped like 30-40 times and thats A LOT more then 4-5. My favorite part was when that dove showed up when Jesus was getting beaten up. I really like this movie and also thought it was gory but i can see that Mel Gibson had to make it like this b/c he wanted ppl to see the Truth of it all. Im seeing it tomorrow so when i see it i might have a different view point the second time around.
