This seems like a bit of a rip-off for a tattered, flea market suitcase. Apparently though, upon examinining the contents of this suitcase the buyer assured himself that he had procured a rather good deal.  The suitcase contained a treasure trove of The Beatles' memoriabilia inculding original photos, concert programs and previously unreleased recordings and mixes of songs off of Abbey Road. Speculators think that this was the luggage of a former Beatles roadie and sound-tech that was killed by police for brandishing a fake firearm.  I could only imagine. Everyone examines flea markets looking for good deals, looking to fulfil small needs, real or imaginary and to stock their homes full of treasures that have all but been cast off by the seller or the original owner. Whether this tourist was simply looking for some luggage to take home some memories from down under or whether this was a buyer who was quite happy to land on the reciprical side of the age-old addage "caveat emptor", this tourist scored a treasure of high value at this little Australian flea-market. I hope that this tourist deems it prudent to place these treasures in a position that makes them accessible to the ever-marching veritable army of Beatle-maniacs that still walk the earth, rather than simply sell them to the highest bidder (although the two ends there could very well be in the same person).  One can only hope that in the future more sleeper-treasures will continue to be unearther in regards to musical legends.  Speaking of sleepers.....  Between the hours of 8pm on Tuesday July 13th and 8am Wednesday July 14th I slept 10 hours in total. Now this may seem unimpressive to the average person, but if you know me in the flesh, you realize that an amount of sleep like that lies somewhere in the realm of miraculous. I generally sleep between 3 and 6 hours a night (and have done so for many years) and experiencing that much sleep has thrown my body for a bit of a loop. Although I'm sure it is related to the head cold I'm battling through, it is still a little disconcerting to know that my body can take over my regular habits and patterns of living and make me a slave to it's desires.  I'm taking a full day off of work today to return myself to tip top condition and further enable myself to resume my professional and personal responsibilities on the morrow. This also gives me 8 extra hours of time while I rest today to occupy myself. Not being a fan of daytime television, this gives me the oppurtunity to clean my apartment, get some laundry done and perhaps work on the computer a little towards some projects and hobbies I have had on the back-burner for a while.   For the dozen or so of you who have already submitted your pics to the blog for the advertising contest, I know I told you they would be up on Monday or Tuesday. I want to beg your forgiveness, and reassure you that you will see them up and going by the end of the week. This cold took the wind out of my sails a little and I seem not to have the energy or concentration to do much.  So to all I wish a great day and shalom unending.  Rooster
