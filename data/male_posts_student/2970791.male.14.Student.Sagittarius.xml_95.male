So I have to think of something meaningful for the 100th post on the blog of the damned. ::puts on trucker thinking hat:: ::thinks:: well, the trucker hat of knowledge hasn't helped me at all. phui. Well, this was fun lets do it again sometime. Whoever centered the whole blog (quiggy...) should be brutally beaten my me it looks weird, at least I think it does. P.S. Everone should please put up post titles.
