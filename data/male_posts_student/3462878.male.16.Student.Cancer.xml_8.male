Some people could suffer from memory loss and forget what the fuck is going on (in the film), or it could be getting to a good part. Another thing, fucking ITV, what the fuck is the point?! Now, last night, Hannibal was on, and since I have seen Silence of the Lambs (which was on last week), I figured I deserved to watch Hannibal, so I did, the only thing was it finished at 1:15 in the fucking morning, and as fucking always, I had to be up early for paper round. So I decided to watch it all (I believe in watching all or none of a program, if you can't watch the end, don't bother watching the start, you'll just wonder what the fuck happened, same deal with Hannibal last night) and therefore stayed up till 1:15, then I couldn't sleep, so I went on the comp for a little bit, tried to sleep for a bit, didn't work, read for a little bit (this was like 2am), then I finally got to sleep at like 2:30, and I had to be up at 6:30 (well, I didn't have to, I wanted to get up early, so I could finish the round early, and get home to watch TV and sleep). But no, I woke up at 7:30, persuaded Dad to take me round in the car (because I wanted to get back quickly to watch TV and stuff), plus it was raining, and I couldn't be arsed to go around for an hour and a half in the pouring raining, going to and from the fucking paper shop (which takes fucking ages), at least when we go in the car, we can take all the papers out in one go (which is fucking impossible to do on bike, I've got like 50 thick papers) and therefore eliminates the going to and from the shop.   Next we move to Pop Beach from Channel 4. I know a lot of the people who are reading this like the music that will be on offer there, but the adverts are doing my fucking head in!! To be quite honest, they were annoying when they first came on, (ABOUT 20 FUCKING YEARS AGO!!) with June Sarpingpong and her annoying scratchy voice talking about who will be on Great Yarmouth beach (wow, fun in the sun!) on June 6th. Yes, I did pretty much memorise it, IT'S ON EVERY FUCKING AD BREAK!!  Just to reiterate on a previous post, LET ME FUCKING SLEEP!! Especially when I've had a late night, just leave the fucking house, and let me sleep in peace. Come on! I mean, I try to stay quiet when you're trying to sleep, could you at least let me do that?!  My room is fucking weird, I mean, it's like the warmest room in the summer, AND the coldest in the winter. It is not nice, for example, in the winter, I'm there with like two fucking jumpers on, and the fucking fan heater at full blast.  Finally in my little rant, we have a point that is related to a previous point in this post, and that is that all the decent programs are on really late at night, and usually on days when I can't watch them. Such as on school nights, and Saturday nights (when I've gotta be up early for papers in the morning).   I know I said fuck a lot in this post, I don't really give a shit.   It could be because I've lost out on sleep that I'm this cranky, but I just need to vent every so often.
