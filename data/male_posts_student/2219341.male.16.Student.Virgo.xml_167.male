Dad, Beke, and I went into London to the Imperial War Museum.  we rode a train from here in Walton-On-Thames to Waterloo station in London.  they we went to a small sandwitch place to get somethin to eat.  afterwards we walked over the museum and spent the rest of the day their.  they had a whole bunch of exhibits there.  world war 1  2 exhibits.  and their were all of these old planes and tanks and submarines.  it was really awesome!  but their was this terrible exhibit on the the holocaust.  it was gross.  sickening.  anyways.  tomorrow im supposed to be going either back to London to walk around and see Westminister Abbey, Big Ben, Tower of London, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, and anywhere else.  and then maybe sunday we will go Windsor castle.  and then monday is PARIS!  woohoo!  alrighty then.  its bout 11PM here so i think i'm gonna go to bed.  bon soir.
