This morning a beautiful fog lay over the land. I like the fog. I like most natural occurences, but the fog I like for a specific reason. It hides; it covers indiscriminately. It has an almost chameleon-like affect, protecting those who do not want to be seen. Too bad it did not cover me.  My "secret" dating life is out. I don't know why I liked it as a secret. My personal life tended to be ignored  and for good reason: I didn't have one. But now that I do have a "life", I am subjected to the scrutiny of my peers. The word got out by way of my fellow dater. It left her lips, travelled through her friend, and on to a pal of mine. I don't know why I bother with the Internet. Gossip and knowledge travels so much faster on the System. Yes, friends, the System. This great behemoth is the interconnected discussion wonder of humanity that has been around since the beginning. I'm sure Adam and Eve were thoroughly Systemized. I have to admit, this is my first true run-in with the System. I've always lived in outcast-style nonconnectedness. I'm not sure I like being plugged in to the System. Meh *shrugs*
