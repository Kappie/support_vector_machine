I just got home from my Japanese meeting an hour ago, where I learned when I'm leaving and who my host family is and all that good stuff.  My host family seems nice, and they don't smoke, and they have 2 kids, a 16 year-old daughter and a 13 year-old son.  So, that could be pretty kool.....as soon as Ashley*my friend* read the people in my host family she was like, OOOO, a 16 year-old girl ;-)  Ya right, if i can't get any american chicks, what makes her think that sumone from a totally different country would show any interest.  Also a notable note, I'm the ONLY guy going on the trip, I'm the only male, all the rest are of the female species....I haven't decided if this is good or bad.  Last night was fun though, I got home from my mom's house about 9:00ish, and I got online*of course* and instantly I was told to go to the Song Garden, so I asked my dad if I could, and I could, so I went.  When I got there, only Ervin was there, and then Brittany showed up very close*time wise* behind me, and then Kyle showed up like 5 minutes later, how was he so slow?!?!?!?!?  So we sat and ate sum food, and by we I mean Kyle, Ervin, and me*Brittany didn't eat any, how come girls never want to eat around us....especially at the Song Garden?!?!?!?!*  I didn't finish all of mine because it was pretty spicy, so I got it put into tiny boxes and brought it home and my dad ate it for lunch today.  Either way, after we wre done eating there, we decided we didn't want to go home yet, so we drove over to Conor's and played ding-dong-ditch on him....except his doorbell didn't work...so we just hit it instead, and then we were walking and this SUV drove past us like 8 times just yelling things at us, then they drove past one last time, and Brittany and Ervin ran to the side of the road*pansies* and me and Kyle just stood there, oops, Kyle and I just stood there, and they just drove past, but then they jsut drove past and didn't do anything, then like 50 feet away they threw a cone out the window....so I went and picked it up.  Then another car came past and i threw the cone to the side so that they wouldn't see it.  Then I remembered that I had to piss really really bad, so I went and pissed off in the trees, meanwhile Kyle, Ervin, and Brittany just walked away.  Then when I was done, I went and grabbed the cone, and walked over to Kyle, Ervin, and Brittany, who were contemplating ding-dong-ditching Mr. Rohl.  I just took my cone and started walking back to Brittany's car, and this guy came out from this near-by house without a shirt, and when he got close to us he yelled "Oh Shit!" and ran away back to his house, and halfway there his phone fell of his buckle, and I yelled "You dropped your phone!"  Then I continued to walk, and I was soon joined by Brittany and Kyle.  A while later Ervin came running after us and he had ding-dong-ditched Mr. Rohl, and it was all good.....then we got into the car, and were dropped off at our cars, and we drove home, and I slept....and then i woke up and went to my meeting, leaving me here, writing this......well....I've taken up enough of the internet, I'll go....PEACE-OUT!
