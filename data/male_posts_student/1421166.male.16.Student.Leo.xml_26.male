In the song there was this part:  A moment like this  Some people wait a lifetime For a moment like this Some people search forever For that one special kiss Oh I can't believe it's happening to me Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this.  How true...indeed there are many times and moments we should really cherish. Moments that are once in a lifetime, even moments when we go through hardship, the "downs" in our lives. Now, I stand in this point in my life. There are times I miss. My primary school days, my time seating alone by the window, the happy times I spend with my friends. But I can't go back now. These will only remain as memories. I see now that I must cherish them. I see them in photographs, as records in my journal. What wonder in journalling. The beautiful moments and climax(s) in my life. All in black and white, refreshing my memory. What gift...a journal... I'll be moving school soon. The moments I spent there. I cherish them. I know I'll miss them. And I wrote it down as poem, hoping to recall bits and pieces of memory in the future. When I move to the new school, I guess I'll have to find my own special corner somewhere. Maybe at East Coast. Indeed, it's exciting, but the place that has been a second home for the past two years will be gone soon, no doubt that'll be times when I miss the school now. I'm alone at home now. I'm bored. But I had reflection. And I love it. I miss my friends. But I know that every moment should be cherished, for each is special in its own way.
