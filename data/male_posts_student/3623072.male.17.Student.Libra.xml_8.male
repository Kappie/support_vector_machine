I'm trying my best wat happened yesterday and today.   At school: I've arrived a bit late about 30 mins after my expected time to arrive at school. Not much student councils came at school about 3 guys + muiz's driver. Boy, the room was  TOTALLY  dusty. I've never seen a room so messy with such large amout of dust. Its like it havent been cleaned for a decade already. Hahahaha~ but it was really fun tho. Me, Muiz and Walid were planning to have a sleepover or camping at the school one day.. OOooh~ that'll be fun. and also we were planning to have our very own refrigrerator, sofas, garden.. *dreaming* haha we must be dreaming its impossible for us to have this kinds of things cos we're only be elected for student council for 1 1/2 year. I think tat its just a waste.   WWE Raw Reviews last nite:   The show started with "The Rock". Its been really been a long time thta he didnt came to RAW. Everytime, he talks to the crowd, I can actually feel some goosebumps coming up. I dont know bout U Guys.     Yea~ And The Rock Make fun of Randy Orton and His Dad and Grandpa. hahaha Pretty funny.      1st Match:  Trish Stratus (c) Vs. Victoria  for the Women's Title. Women’s Champion Trish Stratus (with Tyson Tomko) defeats Victoria. Here I find that the Referee is so stupid! Why i say stupid??! Well Trish Cheated by pinning vICTORIA WHILE hold on the ropes IN FRONT of The REferee! iSnt that Stupid?!! See for Urself:      2nd Match:  Kane vs. William Regal . The match between William Regal and Kane never officially gets underway. No comment on it. But Eric Bishoff is an  ASSHOLE!       This time, the Big Red Monster delivered damning news just before the adoring and pregnant Lita could accept Matt Hardy’s heartfelt marriage proposal. Much to Lita’s dismay, Kane revealed that he’s likely the father — not Matt. And after braving some of the most death-defying matches in WWE history, a distraught Matt could do little more than flee the scene. I knew it!! Kane wa the father of the child. I wonder how the Baby will look like..  *evil laughs*        3rd Match:  Tag Team Match: Randy Orton and Batista Vs. Edge and Chris Jericho .Randy Orton and Batista def. Edge and Chris Jericho. Hope that Edge will have another opportunity to get the Intercontinental Title. Hate To c Randy still having that title. hmph!!    *Jericho In Pain*      *Batista powerbombed Edge*      *Randy About to give the RKO to Edge*    The Main Event:  Triple H vs. Eugene . Triple H and Eugene wrestle to a no contest. Eric Bishoff Demanded Triple H to destroy Eugene before he was going to pinned eugene after delivering the Pedigree. Then Trips took a chair outside out of the ring and try to hammer Eugene with it. Luckily Chris Benoit was here to save Eugene and took the Chair from Trips and The rest of the Evolution came into the ring but unfortunately, Chis Benoit accidentaliy hit Eugene with the chair. Immediately while Benoit was in shocked , Trips immediately took the chair from him and hit Chris Benoit. Evolution conquered the ring.             ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Today nothing much happen. This afternoon, i've downloaded an anti-virus software from microsoft.com where they recommend to use this software if my PC's performance is slow. After i downloaded, i restart the PC. Then the computer acted a bit weird. When i open my desktop it took about 30 Minutes to upload evrthing. Then I know i really have to delete or remove some of the useless programs in my PC. After hours of removing 2/3 programs and few times of restarting the PC, the PC still acted the same. Then i tried to delete the Anti-Virus software that i downloaded earlier. And to my surprise the PC is no longer slow. Hahaha~ Now.. I dont think that Microsoft is not to reliable since this happen. So guys becareful what u download form Microsft website. hahaha It could happen to You.  *evil giggle*   Ok Till Next Time,  Sayonara~    Hazim x0x0x0x0x
