So i say to myself "WTF" and i go to nowhere else but the Xbox Forums. This is what i find  urlLink Halo 2 Boards.         So, apparently this was attempt by Bungie and Microsoft to stir up some controversy. I didn't realize that they had done it until i read this:  urlLink Gamespy's Halo 2 Article . It states in the last apragraph this extact thing:             "The last thing we see is that familiar Xbox logo, but if you look carefully, there is one quick frame where the www.xbox.com turns into www.ilovebees.com. Going to this site opens a whole new can of worms, which we can't really talk about yet. You can be sure that we'll be letting you know what's up as soon as we can!"        Ok i don't really know whats going on , but it seems that there is a countdown in progress and it may led up to a suprise release to Halo 2 or a demo but no1 really knows so we'll just have to wait and see.
