My post that I was going to do LAST sunday was going to talk about how fucking insanely awesome Don's Party at the house was on that previous saturday.  Since theres no chance of me remembering EVERY party detail..heres a few. The place was PACKED...HOT..and covered in beer.  Working bar is the Absolute best job...thats where you meet all the people and the people love you because for an hour, you are their beer god.  Among the notable events of the night are me dumping a full cup of jungle juice all over Jenn Higbee because she spilled her beer on me, Ray dumping a full cup of beer on a girl because she was giving him some unnecessary attitude at 2am, and the girls walking around without shirts on...half naked chicks..always a definite plus.  Ray, Kayla, Erin and I had an awesome time.  Our tree in the fraternity definitely knows how to fucking throw some killer parties.  We were talking about renting a house semester at one point too, and that would be awesome...but I don't know if thats a good idea, since I don't have much free time(if any) the way my major is. I dont think I'd be able to handle more stress ontop of what I go through.  Anyway..awesome party..I was drunk...damn that evil don and his 7 kegs.  Late into the night on my way home I was treated by a FREE shower from mother nature.  In other words, it started to fucking POUR. But nothing was going to bring my  "high" down that night.  It was one of those nights where you feel like you are truly alive...high on life kind of thing..but remember, you have to come down from ever high, and I will get back to that thought later on.  The rest of the following days were hell and then some...Sunday night and Monday were spent in the computer lab..for hours and hours and hours..and hours :( NOT A FUN TIME.. you;d be surprised how annoying  and time consuming it is to teach  a computer how to sell you a fucking pepsi. ITS ALL YOUR FAULT...YOU DAMN CONSUMERS!...shit..i buy soda...fuck(HITTING MYSELF IN THE HEAD)..;) anyway...that was monday...then tuesday, some of wednesday and thursday were spent playing with cars and cdrs..which, unless you are Matt Young, you will have no fucking clue what that means either, but just know that it SUCKS... FINALLY..thursday night I got a chance to chill...stopped by the bar and grabbed some guinness and black and tan, and went to the house to drink a little...ok..more than a little.. I had a nice convo when I was working outside  with Jeff Collier about women, and then..the unthinkable happened..... I signed up for Beer Pong with My good friend, and new ZBT brother, JB Markle...we watched as The king of all beer pong at zbt, smiley, and his partner, Shaun Egge, destroyed the competition team after team. We decided it was about time to make smiley frown and crack the egge,,and BEAT THEM. Thats right...myself and JB..the underdogs. The game started out with the  champs handing us our asses, but the more cups of evil natty we had to drink, the better we got...we started to sink them...their lead shrank down to nothing and eventually we got the edge.  A half hour had passed of this INTENSE beer pong battle..it was 6 cups to 3...us ahead...and smiley...SANK ONE... FUCK!!!! EGGE sank one...FUCK FUCK FUCK  4 to 3.JB and I take shots..and BOTH miss.....SMILEY and EGGE take shots...One made one miss...3 to 3...out nowhere john and i make 2..get the balls back and miss 2, smiley makes one...2 to 3..John and I shoot, i made one, john missed.  2 to 2.  Both smiley and egge miss..balls come back..JOhn makes one I miss one. 2 to 1....Egge and SMILEY BOTH MISS.....I take the first shot and miss..and out of nowhere in one swift flick of the wrist...JB used all of his stored up redneck power...and MADE IT....WE FUCKING WON......HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!!!!!!! WE BEAT SMILEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That was one of the best nights of my life...hands down.  Friday Ray and I decided to go home and stay over night. We went to banana Joes Friday night with Zambricki and Mr. Cella..  Place was packed off the wall with alot of lovely Valley Girls...something you don't see much of at ESU...the retarted midget was giving zambricki dirty looks and flipping him off as usual.  We had a few beers...fought through the crowd a few times...played the AGG....then went into the bar in the techno room.   Shortly after. Lou "Mr." Cella..saw a few of his students...they saw him..he got embarassed and left.  LOL never fails lou. Its kinda sad, because there aren't many people at home that like to go out and act their ages..aka party...be social..etc.. Lou's an awesome friend, but what he can do is limited by his profession,understandably.. and of course we encouraged lou to pass his students along to us..but of course it was a joke.  Towards the end of the night ray saw his cousin and we were talking to him and his friends..then we went into the dance club and got elbowed by some ignorant fucks, all who strangely turned out to be black..and i wasnt the only person that noticed that either..so FU... On the ride home we did our usual half drunken ritual of singing crappy 80s songs..though we didnt have we're not gonna take it..which was disappointing...but the night was still tits.  In other good news....7 dvd;s came to my house with the correct address for a person named Joy..and under PA consumer law , i got to keep them :) Also, ESU sent me some money, so I went to Muscle Mag and got some Cell tech and Muscle gainer and 3 new shirts to wear at parties :FU, Undercover Police, and Kappa Tappa Kegga...all for 20 bucks!  Saturday night...another kick ass party at the house..Ray and I were heavily plugging our first ZBT party of the semester that was supposed to happen today,monday...the Graffiti party.  The night came to a screeching halt when the NEW landlord came and shut us down...here's the BAD part I was talking about before. The guys that live at the house had a meeting with the new landlord last night and they have 30 days to get out(something about too many people not on the lease, and he doesnt want any big parties..now what fun is that?). This leaves us without a house to throw in.  Thats a major MAJOR problem in my eyes.  Now, being in a fraternity isnt all about parties, but its an essential part.  It splits importance with academics, Brotherhood, Community service, in the respect that..the way the community gets to know you is community service, the way people get to know you is socially...especially at parties.  This is going to fuck up recruitment quite a bit.  Those who dont see that happening are blind.  People know the frats by the kinds of parties they throw..etc..thats where you meet everyone..people you wouldnt normally see on a daily basis.  Theres a colony on campus, ACACIA...they don't have a house...RARELY throw elsewhere and theyre recruitments have been pretty bad... It sucks for the guys at the house especially because they are losing where they live...that Really really really blows.  I'd be lying if i said that i didnt care about drinking, being social..parties..hell thats ONE OF THE reasons why i joined ZBT in the first place..i'm in college to finish college, but i'm also here to party...i missed out on it in high school and i'll be damned if i'm going to miss out on it now.  I love zbt...my brothers are awesome..great guys..really..something you wouldnt expect with a FRAT(and shut up..yes I DO CALL my country a CUNT.Its the only place here i have an extreme amount of fun..its the only place i feel like me.. But I know life is about change and dealing with it. As a fraternity we now have to stay afloat and get people on campus attention other ways until we come up with a soluton..Slak,Kevin,Seneca,Egge, Joe B, Curtis ,Aaron, and Steve hopefully will be able to find some place to stay too..and rituals...who knows..i'm sure our fearless E-board led by Young Matt Young will be able to come up with something.   This news hit me pretty hard because it reminded me when something I worked for, and others worked for hard, for several years, Underground Wrestling in NEPA died.  But in this situation, by no means is ZBT dead...we just experienced a setback, we'll come back..we always do...Just like last time when that fucking flaming homesexual of a sad excuse for a human being, let alone greek advisor, kevin lockwood, put us on suspension last semester...FUCK YOU KEVIN..and tomorrow is officially FU kevin lockwood day...Where at The Interfraternity Council meeting tomorrow, he will be getting a collective FUCK YOU from all of the fraternities on campus because he is being a big DOUCHEBAG...and in honor of FU lockwood day..i will be sporting my new FU tshirt.   So well those were some sorta quick details about my life...  Now a few quick thoughts about life that i came up with today while walking to the caf.  -The past is gone, the future may never come, the only thing that is real in life is NOW.  -Life is ever changing...as you read this, something in YOUR life is changing, be prepared.  Umm...no song to think about right now..maybe i'll post one later.  As always, you have any response to anything here...email it to me..jms504@juno.com.  Its great to be a Zebe. RUSH PIMP!!!!!
