When we were at the terminal, I suddenly had a wave of depression... I felt that ppl were ignoring me... and I felt very left out... I just wanted to cry... Luckily.. once we boarded the ferry, I slept it off... On reaching the Desaru ferry terminal, we had to sit a pretty long ride on a "bus sekolah" which was hot and cramp... which made me feel worse... but then somebody complimented me on my piano playing, and that kinda cheered me up a bit.... Once we were at the resort, and I got my key, I rushed all the way to the villa and well.. the facilities there were kinda good... better then chalet bah.. but the neighbouring room's aircon was spoilt.. haha... but who cares... That night, I played for the worship... Kinda nervous... this was one of the few times I was performing on my own...  DaY 2:  Woke up at about 7:30... and we had to be at the breakfast table by 8:00.. haha.. everybody was like rushing here and there... We had a pretty rushy devotion the rushed to the table... Dennis was the camp speaker... His topic was focused mainly on revival... He was kinda good... We went to the fruity farm in the afternoon... saw all the different variety of plants, bees, and not forgetting our very friendly neighbourhood mosquito... We even set on a hellish hot van.. Mainly becoz the van was painted black...  After the farm visit, me and Haryanto went to swim... The pool was not to say exectly very clean.... diaoz... There was another talk in the evening and I was the pianist too... But this time, David was helping me... After the talk, we went to the lounge to have a game of pool... Jowyne was drinking Singapore Sling... I still dont get why people like dat... Its like vodka, cough syrup and orange juice mixed together.. At night... I slept next to Haryanto.... I thought back of the time when I had a crush on him... and kept looking at him sleeping peacefully.... part of me wanted to hug him... but another put of me pulled me back... in the end.. i resisted... fortunately...  DaY 3:  Woke up quite early today... had ample time to bathe... Sometimes I still find i have quite a nice body also... but... dono bah... Jealousy can do wierd things.. Nothing much happened in the morning, and I had a nice doze in the afternoon, and was woken up in the late afternoon by Haryanto and David to go play games...  Haha... The sea was magnificent! The tides were 8 or 9 times higher then Singapore's, and they were really strong... Spent my time breakind the waves and riding the tide... haha.. a surf board would really be useful now.. lolz!  Haryanto stepped on a sharp shell and it injured him... gave me a scare... In the evening, we had a game of treasure hunt... lolz... It was really scary.. they hid the sticks in all the wierd dark places... and it was really dark... pitch black... the scary shack we went to find one of the clues was so dark that we could not see anything beyond the torchlight's light! And the house gives me the creeps too... At night I suddenly had a bout of stomachache... It was horrible.. I was vomiting the whole night... I suspected I had food poisioning (again)... haiz... Whole night spoilt...  DaY 4:  I woke up in the morning feeling terribly weak and sick,... I couldn even sit up... I juz lied down in bed the whole morning.. I couldn attend the talk too... haiz However, by God's grace, my stomach became better by the afternoon and I could eat some food.. In the afternoon, we had to go... I slept on the bus and ferry and bus... haiz.... stupid stomachache...   Overall, the camp was fun... if not for the stomachache... Oh yeah.. during the whole time there, David and Matt played Hillsongs, Sonicflood... all the time... It was cool... we really came closer to God and bonded together much more...  Mood: Sick... Tired.. Happy.. dono what lah.... sleeeeppy
