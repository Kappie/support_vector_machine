Parties, especially in America are by no means monolithic, despite what commentators and journalists would like you to believe.  There are traditional conservatives, there are Reagan conservatives, there are neo-conservatives, there are southern and northern democrats, and there are pro-choice democrats, and these are just to name a few. Having made our way through the last four years however, the American public has become polarized in a way that I have never seen in my 23 years of life.  But I am astonished by the fact that the bigger polarized mainstream political populations are targeting the smaller groups within the parties for consumption. Perhaps we have all fallen for what seems to be the bigger end game: election 2004.  Is it possible that the stakes have gotten so high that party pluralism is being sacrificed and along with all of the difference of opinions that is key to a functioning democracy?  It certainly seems so.  Whether Bush is reelected seems to be “the” big issue.  I must admit that I have fallen victim to the consolidation of opinion, I voted for Ralph Nader in the last election, but I would be foolish to vote for him again because on my side of the fence there is one goal, and one slogan: Anybody But Bush.  Maybe it should be: Anything But Choice
