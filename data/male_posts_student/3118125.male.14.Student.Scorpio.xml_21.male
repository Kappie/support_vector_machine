This progressed when I learnt PHP; allowing me to create complex login screens, member profile pages, forums and chat rooms. The latest in the series did not attract the number of people as its predecessor. Leaving the site to run on it’s own. I progressed to other things, such as a small, simplistic portfolio page and making a website for the Ise Lodge United Football Club Under 15 Girls. This was the project that I chronicled for you in this record, sadly this will be abandoned as no-one at the team is able to run the site, or provide me with any information to put on it. Now, I am bored. I have no current project. So…. After seeing the that other sites belonging to other people combine multiple aspects together in a single site, I am inspired to emulate this. And since thinking about this, I have had an idea. It will work, and I’m going to do it.  I'm going to enjoy this.!
