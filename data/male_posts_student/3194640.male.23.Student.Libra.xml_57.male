I have to work today. I don't know why. Everyone is closed today in observance of the 4th of July. I also have to go to school today even though every college (except for the one I attend) in town is closed. What are the odds?  Work is super slow today. We have less people working today than we normally do and we're still over staffed. I've had two phone calls since 7:00 am this morning. It is now 10 am. As a result, I've been reading a lot of articles on the internet this morning.  I found this really cool article about   urlLink The 59 Deceits of  Fahrenheit 9/11  . Also I found that there's a new book out about  urlLink Michael Moore  called  urlLink "Michael Moore is a Big, Fat, Stupid White Man" . It's allegedly being buried in America's favorite book stores (*cough*  urlLink Barnes  Noble  *cough*). Read about it   urlLink here .  Anyone catch the news on Tuesday? There wasn't a lot of emphasis put on the whole transfer of power in Iraq. Remember when missiles were fired at the Sheraton Hotel in Baghdad the other day? The headline read:      urlLink  EXPLOSIONS ROCK CENTRAL BAGHDAD      (only  one  person injured)    That's right, only   ONE   person was injured in the attack. No casualties. The headline made it sound like there was some real action going on. Upon reading the article, I discovered that it was about a few idiot terrorists. These guys were amatures. This is my favorite part of the  urlLink article  (as reported by  urlLink The Associated Press :    A U.S. soldier at the scene said assailants fired rockets from a homemade launcher in the back of the van. Some of the rockets caught fire before they could be launched, he said, setting the van ablaze.  "After the incident, the car exploded," said an Iraqi police captain who spoke on condition of anonymity.  ...Earlier, insurgents using rockets also attacked the area near Marjam Hotel, which is also used by Westerners. One rocket struck a statue in nearby Wathik Square and another landed near the Indonesian Embassy, but did not explode, police said.    If I was only reading the headline, I would have thought something important had taken place. In reality, the situation was almost laughable, except for the poor guy whose leg was smashed during the incident.   The news only tells America about the terrible things that happen. Even worse, some of the things they broadcast aren't even that significant. Talk about media bias...
