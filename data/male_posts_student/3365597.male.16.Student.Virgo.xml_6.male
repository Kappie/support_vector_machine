And all that just because I heard some rumours from friends of mine who worked with him back in the days.. But today I saw the living legend who Robby Naish is, on an MTV show about red bull king of the air.. He was being interviewed by this guy who just doesn't seem to give a f*ck about how famous you are, and that interview completely changed my mind about Robby Naish. I totally respect the man. I even met Robby Naish once.. It was at the Kiteboard Masters in Scheveningen two years ago. I just arrived there with my dad and a friend of mine, when he bumped in to me, and I didn't recognize him at first.. I said hi to him, and he said sorry for bumping in to me, but I didn't mind it at all! it was more an honour, that the worlds most famous kitesurfer/windsurfer ever bumped in to me... Later that day I talked to him again after he had done a heat, and I asked him how it went, and then he just started explaining to me what he thought went well, and what he thought went wrong, and he asked me if I kitesurfed myself! at that time I haven't started kiteboarding yet, but I told him I would very soon... when I think of all this now, I can't believe why I thought he was such an A-hole.. next time I'll think twice before thinking anything about someone..
