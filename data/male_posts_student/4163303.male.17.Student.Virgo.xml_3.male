Well, fuck that. That's not a friend. Friends actually give a damn about their friends. And DON'T ACT LIKE FUCKING BITCHES when you try to share something important with them. I hate it so much. IM glad I have good friends like m***, k****, h*****, and k**** and everyone else. They actually have hearts.
