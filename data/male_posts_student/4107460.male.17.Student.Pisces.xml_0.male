First I got up Saturday and went to work, works not that great but I was feeling really good and energetic. After work I went to the local computer store because all though I am way cool and handsome, I am a geek. So I talked my folks into giving me money to get a new DVD Burner Combo drive, which is awesome. Then I went home and took a shower because I had a date with a really cool girl I met at my new school and her really cool friends which are now mine also. We had a great time, we caught a movie and a meal. Alien Vs. Predator was kinda weak and we spent most of our time joking it. Then we got some pizza and shot pool at Roxy's house. Now we are at Sunday and I slept late, got all my lost sleep back. Then I went to see Calateral with my best friend and his girl and roxy and abbie. Great movie and a great time. So I had a jampacked and exciting weekend. Met a lot of new people and stayed busy. I'm not sure that I will be able to top it for a while, but oh well.
