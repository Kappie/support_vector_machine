I was in the bathroom in the Giant across the street from Wendy's, and on the wall was written, "Here I sit broken hearted; Tried to poop but only farted." Is that dumb or what?  Also, I was watching the commercials for the new season of  American Idol , and that mean dude is meaner than ever. Last year, he said things like, "If you sang like that two thousand years ago they would've stoned you!" Now if someone sings a line that says, "I surrender," he raises his hand and says, "So do we!" Someone also sang the song that says, "I'm all by myself," and he said, "If you keep singing like that, you will be!" He is so funny!  So when do you all have midterm exams? I miss the exam schedule at BLS. It was so much better. The one at Edgewood was just gay. At Baltimore Lutheran, the schedule goes over four days and the schedule goes: Tuesday- Pds. 15, Wednesday- Pds. 26, Thursday- Pds. 37, Friday- Pds. 48. At Edgewood, it was:      -Tuesday: Go to Pd. 1 for announcements and attendance.                      Go to Pd. 2 for extended period for exam; skip Pd. 4                      Go to Pd. 3 and follow complete Rotation C schedule.     -Wednesday: Arrive at school by 10:00; late bell by 10:10.                           Go to extended Pd. 1 for announcements, attendance and exam.                           Go to extended Pd. 3 for exam                           Lunch is determined by Pd. 3 teacher's lunch.     -Thursday: Arrive at school by 10:00; late bell by 10:10.
