Stephanie Herseth (D)  I believe that both of these people will make South Dakota a Great place no matter what party they're in. If I could vote, I probably would vote for Larry Diedrich not because he's a Republican, but because he is the most experienced and I believe he would know what he would be doing.  J.D.
