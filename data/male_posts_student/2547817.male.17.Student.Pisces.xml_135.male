Hopefully Pan Pac will have the required equiptment. If not, this could be a be a flop. Failure is not an option.  I saw a sex in the city advert today. The line read, "Love is worth waiting for". I Thought of Des, then Zel. I feel bad that I thought of Zel second. I'm being obsessive. And by the way reader, a poet is the only person in the world who'd obsess over whether or not to use "and" "the" and "I". And they in all theirairs tell you that your craft needs perfecting.  Tell me then, When will it ever be good enough for you?
