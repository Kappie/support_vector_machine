Yes, they're almost as commercial as most punk bands.  Yes, they're milking their success for all it's worth.  But no, I'm not contradicting myself in saying I like this band.  Why?  It all comes down to that one issue, the one that should dictate whether or not anyone should actually like certain music: they're actually talented enough to pull it off and still sound original in the process.  This is partially due to the fact that they have tapped into the forbidden fruit of the rock world.  Yes, that's right, I'm talking about...numetal.  Numetal has been trashed left and right by everyone and his mother, and I'm getting really tired of it.  I'm convinced that people just trash it because it is slowly accomplishing the noblest of duties: it is replacing punk as the "teenage" rock...  Yes, that's right.  And I, for one, raise my nonexistent tankard of mead in salute.  Take those punk bastards out!  So, back to the CD.  This CD had been long - awaited by fans complaining about them taking too damn long to record the thing.  Compared to TFSOP's recording time of one week, this one took 2 years or so to record.  And it really shows: this CD is really polished, with interludes smoothly moving song to song.  Good vocals and guitars make this decent, but what really makes this shine is the drumming, bass, keyboard, and orchestral sections.  I'll highlight some really good points in my song by song review.  1) We Still Kill the Old Way One hell of a way to start off the album.  Awesome intro, great scream harmony with the singing, overall great song.  2) To Hell We Ride A darker song, this has a really intricate guitar intro and good screaming where it needs it.  Excellent stuff.  3) Last Train Home If you haven't even heard of this song, you live under a rock.  For the rest of us, this is, some say, their best song on the album.  I disagree, but I'm putting a solid second place on it because it kicks so much ass.  Emotional singing/lyrics/keyboard, talented, well-played...the list goes on.  4) Wake Up (Make a Move) I'm not a huge fan of this song, but it has its good points, I'll tell you that.  A very small orchestral part in the second prechorus, but otherwise a pretty boring song.  It bridges the gap effectively, though.  5) Burn, Burn The skater song in the album.  I'm not a big fan of this type of song, but it's good for what it is.  For what it is.  Good guitaring, so-so vocals/lyrics, nothing much else significant.    6) I Don't Know Listen carefully on this one.  In the background is one hell of a complex drumbeat, but it fits in with the syncopated vocals and the simple guitaring.  Definitely above par.    7) Hello Again (Gothic) A very interesting song, this is probably the darkest on the album.  Definitely not something you'd hear on the radio, but still good stuff.  Excellent lyrics, good growly verse vocals, generally awesome.  A good middle song for the album.    8) Goodbye Tonight And we've changed gears on this one!  We go from the darkest song in the album to the closest song to becoming pop.  Even though it bears the feelings of that other genre, though, this is still kickass 'prophets all the way.  Good lyrics/vocals, great guitaring in the hook, overall a good song before the turning point of the album.  9) Start Something And I mean a turning point!  You see, this CD plays almost like a story in music.  This is the song closest to being full-fledged metal on the album, right before it starts the last 3 songs...those 3 that will determine the fate of the universe! (Or, at least, the album's grade...the story analogy only goes so far)  Great heavy guitars, awesome bass, so-so lyrics, alright vocals, and a nice piano part at the end that leads to...    10) A Million Miles I had to blink a few times to avoid crying at the beauty of the complete harmony of this song.  Excellent lyrics/vocals, great guitaring, and the best part: the best upbeat support violin in the album.  I mean, this thing had a fucking solo in the middle of the song.  The awesomeness of this incredible feat is too much to explain.  It's just that incredible.  For this, Last Train Home is bumped down to #2 and this one is put up there...supreme champion of all.  11) Last Summer We have their obligatory song about summer right here, with awesome vocals, great guitaring, and the best bass on the album.  This, my friends, is #3.  12) Sway And here's the slow song...yeah.  Not as good as Demon Hunter's slow songs, but no one can beat Hunter for those.  Emotional vocals, good piano, and an interesting coda for around 6 minutes or so after the song proper ends...but the song proper is not that good.  An average end to an excellent CD  As a side note, Lostprophets considers this their first "actual CD", because of the time spent on it compared with TFSOP.  TFSOP was not as polished, but it was definitely better.  If the material (Wake up, Burn, Burn) is inferior or repetitive to start with, polishing up the things in between ain't gonna help.  Clocking in at a healthy 54 minutes or so (49 without the coda), this is one helluva buy at $13.  So, go for it, but don't be expecting the complete excellence associated with Demon Hunter.  This band is definitely one to look out for in the years to come, but for now, fans will return to TFSOP until a 3rd comes out.   Report Card: +longer CD +inexpensive +great secondary effects +good vocals - a little too punk-y on some songs - some repetitive stuff - weak slow song appearance  Grade: B+.  Overall, pretty decent, but some little things drag it down.  I cannot in conscience give it an A grade, because even these little things make a huge difference.
