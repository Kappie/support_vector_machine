Here’s the story:       So on Wednesday the  urlLink Honda Service Center  did a test to see if anything else was wrong with the engine beside the timing belt being broken for $150, since when a timing belt breaks it can hurt other parts of the engine, that way I’d only be out $150 instead of $575 if it needed more repairs that I didn’t want to pay for. Everything came up fine and they did the repairs I have previously mentioned. Then yesterday they call me to say that one of the cylinders has a hole in it and it’s going to cost even more. As you can imagine, dear reader, I was pissed. They tried to assure me that they’d try to keep the total cost to around $1,500 which I promptly informed them I wasn’t about to pay that much to fix a car that wasn’t even worth $1,500 and even more so I wasn’t going to pay $575 for the work already done (they didn’t do the tune-up or gasket replacement after they found the hole) since I was supposed to know about the hole when they did the test for $150 – the whole point of testing it. Long story short, after arguing with the slick and slimy service manager I agreed to pay for the parts that they installed in my car, but none of the labor which brings my grand total to $300 - $150 for the test and $150 for the parts.       So now I have a car running on three cylinders instead of four – which means it could die once and for all in a couple months or (hopefully) last until I graduate    in the Spring when at that time was planning on getting a newer car anyway. At least I have my car out of that crooked  urlLink service place . Don’t take your car there.
