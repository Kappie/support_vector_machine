Oh...and Boys are Dumb. They really are, and many other things, like frustrating, and clueless etc. Too tired/racked with hacking coughing to get into it now. Great, i am sick and have watched all five seasons of Babylon Five, nothing to do whilst laying on the couch forcing down tea and wishing i did not have to breathe. skittles d
