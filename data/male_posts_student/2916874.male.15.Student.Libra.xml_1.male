I've had a good day and I am going to watch the season finale of My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance tonight! It is going to be hilarious!   Over the weekend I went to my friends' Bart and Joe's house. I went on Friday night with my dad and we had a party with them. We sat around and played cards with my friends' aunt and uncle, their mom and dad, and their mom's friend, Cathy. My friends' family has 9 kids and they are all cool. Whenever I go their we always have a good time.  Well anyways. We went there and we had a good time. My dad left and I spent the night Friday, and Saturday and I went home Sunday.   When I got home I took a shower and went to my sister's Gymnastics meet in Battle Creek. I was there for about 3 hours and when we got back into town we all went to Ponderosa Steak House to celebrate. I had a really good weekend! I'll post tomorrow, until then cya!
