You know, lately things have been coming hard, if it's not rebuilding relationships or explaining why I decided to change back to being 'fangay'. Chris said something about me being owned and I have enough nerve as David as coming back. What's that supposed to mean anyway. I got owned, seriously, I matured, fuck man. I'm really get annoyed with Chris, it's like, "you're not my friend, time to turn gay-mode on. " I haven't heard an intellgent thing out of him since we stopped being friends. It is really pathetic. Anyway, Warcraft III was pretty fun, and I'm thinking about buying FFXI if I get the money to waste time for WoW. Well, that's all for now. 2 post in one awake session, man I am a loser.
