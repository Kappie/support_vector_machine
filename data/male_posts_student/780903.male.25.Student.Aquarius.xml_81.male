"over 20 HLS students served in this year only."  2 problems -- (1) don't they mean "this year alone?" and (2) there are over 1700 law students here.  The fact that 20 of them bought tuxedos from this place is decidedly unimpressive.  20 people here have probably been struck by lightning.  Run for Congress.  Contracted syphillis.  Seen Madonna's new movie.  (maybe not the last one)
