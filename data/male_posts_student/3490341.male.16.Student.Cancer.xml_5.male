Well I’m not really sure how I am to start a review of this wholly strange but compelling book; but to state the facts as the main character of the book would do. He is a young boy that has autism which means he does not understand emotions but it does enable him to be un-humanly logical, even doing his maths a level at primary school. The story is based around his life, specifically an incident, maybe even a curious incident, where a neighbor’s dog is stabbed to death one night. He takes it upon himself to find out who is the culprit and decides to write a detective novel in the process, as he like the logic and progression of detective novels. This leads him to finding out a lot about him and his family and leads us to finding a lot about a mindset that can feel very abnormal and somehow alienating to those without it. This book is written as if it were the detective novel of the boy which can make it a very tiring read, because of the interwoven complexities lingering in every page but even so it is gripping in the way that not many books are nowadays. This book made me think about my self and the world and at some points allowed me to understand to the point that I doubted whether my perspectives are correct. This is a book for everyone’s shelves but unfortunately I have a feeling  that all my reviews will sound a bit like that as I have just bought many books to my taste. My understanding that I like these types of books will hopefully allow me to cast a less biased eye on these books. OK then here goes:      No I just cant do it. Its just too difficult to slag this book off!        this book is so good that It would be Sinful to lay criticisms upon it but  Criticisms there are and  so should be Mentioned .As I have already Said this book Can  be Very tiring in the way and style it is written as you cannot relate to the authors perspective and it can  also be very tiring in the complexity of the logic and the Complexity of the problems put forward in the book. Even my, er-hum, superb intelligence was overshadowed. It made me think which is always a good thing because the worst thing is to let a mind go to waste, especially mine.  Maybe you wouldn't see yourself as an intelligent person but if one thing made you think in a book I would say that it was worth reading and this book has so many opportunities for this that it is unlikely that anyone past adolescence will come away empty from it. It is a great and enlightening read suitable for all, thoroughly understood  and enjoyed by older  readers. This will break the monotony of everyday  life . I myself enjoy reading a Dick Francis novel (I’m using Dick Francis in my analogy because of the shear amount of his novels) as much as the next guy but they can all feel the same, even with totally different story lines. This could end up with a development of boredom for reading which is a terrible thing. Thankfully I read a lot of different genres which helps me to battle  this and allows me a broad knowledge. I seemed to have babbled on a little but I feel the book is worth it. Anyways all this was to say that this is a fantastic book. And even if this isn’t your kettle of fish, I doubt that this is anyone’s usual kettle of fish, I’d urge you to read it. Go on
