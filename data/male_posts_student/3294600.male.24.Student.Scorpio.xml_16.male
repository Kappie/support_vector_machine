Of course being a script, when hitting back, everything is gone.  Enough complaining, onto what I tried to post before, just differently written.  The day started out wonderful.  I slept in this morning, but arrived to my 8 AM class with plenty of time.  I was pleasantly greeted on campus by half-naked guys while standing in the hallway for the classroom to open.  I love spring and summer weather!  Although half-naked men are very distracting, it is strongly encouraged and appreciated.  The straight friend in class didn't tease me with his shirt raising and rubbing of his tummy once, not even twice, but yes, three times!  He knows it drives me crazy and he loves the attention.  Of course I enjoy giving him my attention.  He has wild plans for the weekend.  There are two sisters that want him to come over and "play."  I told him they have good taste in men.  He's so awesome and I love having him at school to talk with and hang out.  Between my first and second class I did homework, socialized, and read blogs (damn new addictions).  I finished a couple assignments, but mostl socialized and did E-mail.    English 101 at noon went well.  I received all the information about the assignments I need to do to get caught up.  I'm just slightly overwhelmed by all the work I have in front of me, but I know I have it in me to get it done.  Holly, my instructor, is awesome and is working with me and told me not to worry about it.  More school work and socializing between my second and third class.  I got caught up in Web Design.  Now I'm caught up in 2/3 classes!  Go me!  English 101 will keep me busy enough.  I do need to do some catching up on learning, but no assignments are outstanding.  After class came home, went to yummy Mexican lunch/dinner with my roommate Dale, and then came home and took a nap.  I was exhausted.  I got up for Quest, my Thursday night 20's group in Everett.  After check-ins we finished the second half of the movie CAMP.  It's a good movie, but a bit cheesey.  I saw it with my friend Justin when it was in the theater.    Now I'm home sitting writing my Blog (for the second time and this one isn't as good) and will probably be in front of the computer chatting and doing homework until bed.  I'm also going to go through some of my stuff to figure out what to keep and what to throw before I move.  As of today I have 18 days until I need to be out and hopefully settled into my own place.  I don't know how or where, but I'm optimistic things will fall into place.  I want to surround myself right now with optimistic and motivating people.  As for now, I'm going to copy, press publish, and hope for the best.  If anything new happens before morning I'll return.  My guess the remainder of the night will be uneventful.  :)  -Jason
