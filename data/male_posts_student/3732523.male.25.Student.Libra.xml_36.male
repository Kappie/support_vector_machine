I've heard quite a few people saying something similar today - I guess when it's grey and doesn't stop raining you do have to ask if it really is summer given that it is mid-June. It's only when you realise that Wimbledon started on Monday and you cast your mind back to last year and the year before (and the year before...you get the picture!) that you realise it's the same every year. Here in the UK we've enjoyed some gorgeous weather with temperatures hotter than most of Europe and clear blue skies filled with sun - so we're more than a little pissed off that the annual two weeks of June rain has descended once more.  Hopefully summer - in the form of sun and hot weather - will return once Tim Henman has won Wimbledon and England have won Euro 2004 and we can get back to complaining about how it's far too hot ;) I guess the English are never happy when it comes to the weather...but we wouldn't have it any other way ;)
