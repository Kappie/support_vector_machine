I got a call from the second place we filled out an app with and they approved the application so we have a place to move to now. I'm really stoked to finally get out of Plano. It's not a bad town, and there is a really cool park next to us but it's time to get a place of our own. It's been a while.      I called the first place we looked at to voice all my complaints but they havn't returned my call. Dammit.       Tonight I am going to see the album leaf at hailey's club. Should be nice, I havn't been to a show since I've been back in DFW.
