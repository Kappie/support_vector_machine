My mum said she'd talk to my dad about it, which means she'll force my dad to get it me, so expect me to be going around at superspeed soon :P :D  Maths was even stranger than it usually is today, I think my teacher finally lost the last few cells of her brain, she spent the whole lesson going around taking the mick out of random people O.o  PE was ok today, I did athletics, 200 meter's sprint ect., I thought I did pretty well...  I did a few small changes to the blog today to reflect one or two of the new features blogger has released, If you click on a title, it will take you to a page with only that post on, and if you click on my name which is just under the post, it will take you to my blogger profile.  I think that's it for now, if not, I'll just post another message later :P ;) :D Bye  I think this is the longest message I've ever posted in my blog :D
