I have suffered mental anguish because I almost die in AP Biology due to fatigue and almost die in Economics due to frostbite. Seriously, you try to sit in that portable for an hour each day, and Memphis's ozone-depletion hundred-degree weather will be paradise. At least for a few minutes.  I suffered from that malicious sickness that seems to be floating around. Headaches and fever and stomach cramps and all that fun stuff. It made me miss more enjoyable ventures on Friday night. Disease and work sucks.  No one is online right now, and I am alone and isolated and angsty and suffering from another of those funny mood swings that happens spontaneously and screws up my entire emotional balance. That sucks too. Mood swings. Yep.  Poetry, or conscious thought stream, whatever you want to call it, is good for the creative spirit.    Democracy   My stomach seems to have been empty for the day after I slept sprawled on the sofa with aches lacing my boiling blood, empty like my eyes because I couldn’t see the green light when it flashed at that intersection and that was near where you died, wasn’t it and near where your broken body made me want the cold lead to silence the screaming headache a shifting weather barricade has formed, winds sound again like an ocean wave, trying to uproot oaken toes and fig-laden leaves in a tornado that cracks power lines like cracking that false mentality of safety I believed in when I was a child, the mentality that it was all going to be okay. But it wasn’t, it will never be for me when my life is spent running not from the dark but running from what hides in it like a virus, a virus that affects gays and agnostics and blacks and people who are so damn “different,” the KKK clans, Bellevue and them proper folks who is as straight as a warped board hate them because they represent the principle outside and beyond black chains of slavery and prejudice and centuries that cry Democracy, Republic while slitting the throats of those who knew what each false word meant, and I can say honestly that I fall under a mass generalization that has been looked over for a time. I call it adolescence, when our hormones flood our brains with a drug more potent than any illegal shit that is sold bootleg in the alleys, when our minds want to find clarity but instead we find that expectation to live up to or to make up for or to do, just do it and get it over with, here’s the article about it and here’s a condom, no, forget the condom and go fuck up your life any way you want or you aren’t popular, it’s unfair, is it not dear, but c’est la vie and we’re stuck in knee deep mire and don’t breathe, you might catch my illness or my insane ideas of a neutron star wormhole that could go back in time to when things were…were different, but were they ever changed and how much has the human race evolved to when the power is in the paper and I may not roll into my car seat and pave the streets with new views as I hold your back as I would hold a budding sunflower who won’t open her petals to sunlight.    I bid thee humans a pleasant evening. Go to sleep.
