A quick background breifing goes as I grew up living, eating and shitting baseball,and have currently come back to my first love. I have the low down on the minors, upcoming stars, and can even give my own little spin on the majors and general baseball knowledge, and of course, the old fantasy 2 cents(and the fantasy advice all boils down to how your leagues scoring is set up, so the info is use it or lose it at your own risk). Anyhow, I hope to be the more colorful and passionate of the correspondents, and hope you all look forward to my posts and get something from them, because the best is yet to come, always...                                                                     Signed,                                                                   The BP junkie   Torture - standing outside the gate, hearing the crack of the bat, and seeing schmucks get balls you know you could out hustle...
