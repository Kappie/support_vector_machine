All pictures are courtesy of Laura.    Claudia and Kendal are unaware of the monstrous Bun-Bun that lurks behind them.    If anyone was unsure of my sexuality, they should look here. Also, notice Ryan in the background. And this is the infamous fake ID Toby made me, for anyone who somehow missed that.    Elizabeth is caught in the act of reading "Lesbian Pulp". Your secret is out Elizabeth.    Camden made fudge for the event(No, I don't really know why either.) It was rather hard. I believe the knife was an outlet of Claudia's anger towards black people.    Lizzy and Laura have a tender moment, while some bizarre person I can't identify rummages through my room.    Pimpin' it. No explanation necessary. Well, I would like an explanation of why Camden is so happy, but I unfortunately don't have one.    Brittny and Tristan, bloodsucking fiends from space. Brittny seems to take a vampiric interest in my Japanese Evangelion manga, while Tristan seems to be attempting to ignite someone by thought alone.    Elizabeth is also pimping it. Camden is still a slut. Laura obviously has the hots for Camden.    Ari seems to know his way around my house. Hmm...    I swear I have no clue what is going on here. But for reasons more or less obvious, I call this picture "Camden Gets High".    Naomi and Bun-Bun, agents of a secret government organization to protect the world against the vampiric aliens we saw earlier. After one of the aliens has attacked a person, the victim ends up looking like the poor soul in the next picture.    Let us all pray for the soul of this young woman.    I don't know why this picture exists. I think Laura had a crush on the fudge also. Oh wait, Camden made the fudge, didn't he? It all makes sense now.    Jian finds pizza very interesting. That she chose to stare at it instead of eat it was my first clue that she was an alien also.    I however, am not an alien. I am just gay and wish I were Japanese.    Like an alien however, I have been known to sit in awkward positions.    After the alien scare was over, we then were invaded by 3' tall goblins. They were non-hostile in the end though, and offered to take a picture for us.    All is well in the end, as always. The guy gets the girl too. It just so happens that in this picture especially, the guy and the girl look very much related.  Thank you for putting up with all this. I love you all, and don't go see The Matrix: Revolutions.
