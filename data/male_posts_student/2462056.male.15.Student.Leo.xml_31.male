So yeah, today I actually did some stuff... I had to cut the grass, which isn't fun... especially when it is as dry outside as... uh... lets say... an empty cup of water... yeah that sounds good. Then I got my haircut, which doesn't look too bad, except its short.... but oh well, what can you do when your parents "care about you..." Then tonight I went to Zach's house, and it was fun, except I don't think people appreciated the board games that much.  We were playing Risk, which was my first time, and I found it really fun.  We played for a while but then people started getting bored.. hehe.. get it.. bored... board game... okay not funny. So yeah, it was fun tonight!  I stayed until about 11:00.  I came home and did some summerwork... for about an hour... got bored, got on here... Ahhh, kinda in a shitty mood... hopefully it will go away with some sleep and then tomorrow some loud music... like... some loud punk or hardcore or something, whatevah! dun dun duuuuuuh... thats all I have now.
