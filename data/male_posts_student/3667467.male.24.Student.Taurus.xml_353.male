Two giant screens in the 1500-person room said simply: "MEET FRED." I now quote from the program handed out to all the participants.  GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR INNER FRED  Who is Fred? And how does he manage to make a difference in the lives of everyone he meets?  --Fred is the customer service rep on the phone who finally gives you some service.  --Fred is the clerk who loans you $5.00 because the ATM is broken.  --Fred is the postman whose outstanding service inspired Mark Sanborn's THE FRED FACTOR.  Fred is the extraordinary person we can all be if we just follow the four life-changing principles that can help us find fresh energy, enthusiasm, and creativity wherever our careers or lives may lead.  Stop making it through the day. Start making a difference.  www.fredfactor.com
