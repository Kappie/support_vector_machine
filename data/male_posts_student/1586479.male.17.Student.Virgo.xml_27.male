The fact that your brain works while your asleep, being able to come up with totally original ideas and actually  LIVE  them is totally amazing.  I had one of the most memorable and vivid dreams I ever had last night. It really had no definite meaning, but it made me laugh and opened me to new emotions. I created a world in my head. I experienced things that I had never experienced before; nothing perverted, just things I want to keep to myself for now because they seem to special and real. Real.  It made me want to be a better person so that I can experience those things again. For real.  Know real. Live real.
