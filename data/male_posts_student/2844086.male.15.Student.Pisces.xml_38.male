Anyway I'm not going to post all of that practice that I didn't get to post because it wasn't good practice. I mean I practiced, but everyday I continually got worse. So I don't think you would have been encouraged to practice!  But anyway. Today I'm really lost. See Ms. Rhonda told me not to practice this week because of what kept happening. So all this week I'm not going to be posting any practice because I won't be practicing! But I might post something so keep checking!
