Halo pissed me off, the last level sucks the biggest wang you ever did see - for ten levels the game has been a combat fps and for the last FUCKING five minutes they decided to turn it into a driving game. I may or may not have mentioned that I loathe driving games. I actually returned all $200 worth of Gran Turismo III and Force Feedback Wheel when I realized that the game was really the bane of my existence. Talk about frustrating. I'm going to see if I can beat it New Years Day - that'd be a good way to start off the year.   On the note of Monkey Island 4 - well the first three were fun - the fourth one still has the same great sense of humour and a lot of lovely injokes for those of us who've stuck with the series. It's also *gasp* gone 3d. For those of you who don't play many adventure games, 3D is usually their death knell. It means that the company has decided to become "proactive" and regain the "cutting edge". HEY FUCKOS - clue in - those of us who play adventure games don't give a good God Damn(tm) whether or not the game has more or less polygons than a rubix cube - what we're looking for is challenging puzzles, stupid inventory tricks and bad puns. Fuck you and the 3d engine you rode in on.  The nonspecific rage that filled me scant minutes ago has begun to subside. It might have something to do with the stuffed animals in my lap. Only time will tell
