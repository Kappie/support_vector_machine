First they where down 3-1 with 20 seconds left and i was like, "aww its okay if they win, they're going to the playoffs anyway." Then one of the defense men took a shot and scored with like 14 seconds left. I am like, "yes, they scored but it doesnt matter, theres only 14 seconds left and the puck is about to come out of the zone." Then it just so happened to stay in and someone shot it towards the net. The same guy who scored the goal before scored again! Im screaming my head off and so is everyone in san jose. SO we finally went to sudden death over time and 3:00 minutes in one of the sharks shot the puck and SCORED!!!!!!!!!!!! The game was over and the fans were even louder (including me) then before and it was the perfect game to end the season. After the game, i left for San Fran to see the Lion King and it was great. Good thing i didnt vote for it when we go to D.C.......... It was around 2 hours long and we got home around 10:00 but it was really worth it. It had great costumes and the scenery was really nice. Well thats all for now. peace out
