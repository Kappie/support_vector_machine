I tend to explode in the face of rediculous adversity - things like insurance, taxes, gravity and sharp edges. I get the feeling I should probably seek some therapy for this, but I'll inevitably try to deal with it by myself and end up Falling Down.  Some days it's just not worth getting out of bed. Add this one to the list.  I'm clenching my jaw a lot. I think I need to see my dentist. It's to the point where my jaw is starting to hurt.  I wish my eyes worked like those belonging to regular humans.  They say becoming virtuous takes time. What if patience is the virtue I seek?
