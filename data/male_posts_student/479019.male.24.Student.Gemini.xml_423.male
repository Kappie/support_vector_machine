I have 9 our of 52 done, which means I have 31 days to get 43 pages written. That means I need to write 1-2 pages a day to get all my papers done before I go home.   Oh yea... you know you're an academic when you feel happy discovering something useful about suburbs in Max Weber's massive  Economy and Society .  ***
