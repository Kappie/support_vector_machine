I guess that's what four hours in the sun in the middle of that day can do to you. I AM SO DARK! I miss my nice white color. Now I'm "rainbow bright," hehe Mike said that. I'm red, dark red, brown, dark brown, tan, white, and yellow; hehe gotta love that color spectrum. I'd put a pic of what I look like with a sunburned face but that'd just be bad.      Anyways, band camp wasn't that bad. It was pretty fun seeing all my friends again. Only bad thing was this attraction that I have for my best friend Kody, kept getting stronger and stronger. It really sucks that he isn't gay : (. (I wish he were.)  He encompasses all the traits of the perfect partner (for me), except for that one major component, he isn't gay. Gosh, when I first saw him (since school ended), I was like in awe. He looked sooooooo fuckin' hottt. His now very short hair, made him look all the more attractive. I couldn't help but stare at him a lot, I hope he didn't notice that. Here's another thing that I couldn't help but do: everytime he bent over to pick something up off the ground, I stared at his very nice, cute ass. Man, I feel so wierd. I'm not suppose to feel this way for him, oy. What am I going to do? (I don't know)
