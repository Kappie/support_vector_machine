I come in here quite often, write something for you're entertainment and do nothing else till the time comes to write another post. To say I do all that, the commentage on this thing bites arse. Send a comment. Come on people.  Well, not alot has happened since my last entry. I've become overly infatuated with some one I shouldn't be, which is always a pleasure. never a chore. *shrugs and looks confused*.  It's been a long couple of weeks, and it's almost over. I feel like shit frankly. it's not the best time to leave. I love evryone so much that it's not funny.
