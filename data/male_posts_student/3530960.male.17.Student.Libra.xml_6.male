I could only sleep for like 12 hours straight, and then I couldn't take the two remaining hours. Okay, maybe if the in-flight movie was  Dumb  Dumber  or something like that.  I almost can't stand that movie anymore because they ruined it by making a sequel. You ever notice that sequels either really really suck or are really really awesome?  Spider-man 2  was even better than the first one, and than you have suck-fests like  Rocky 5 . Oh well, what can you do?
