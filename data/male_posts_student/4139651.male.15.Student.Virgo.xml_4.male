There were about six of we soph-o-mores there and we were hanging out until it got really dark, when I had the GREAT idea to learn how to do cheerleading stunts from the girls.  I basically grab Meghan's waiste and throw her up on my shoulders. Then Andrea decided to try and she landed on my neck and I was starting to feel like a fag so I left.  Also, the Zoo that I went to today didn't have any turkeys as advertised. I was hoping to see some at the farm, but they only had cows, and I didn't see them either. I'm come to the conclusion that the Evil Ducks drove the turkeys away.  The Evil Ducks stand near the African cow, glaring at it maliciously, poised to charge like the Orcs during the Battle of Helms Deep. I have a feeling the African cow could handle them, but I think the turkeys might have been overwhelmed.  Which reminds me of my old house in Castle Rock, Colorado. The conifers around my house housed the local wild turkey population. I used to climb the trees and sit under the turkeys.  Also, deer occasionally grazed outside our kitchen window. And there were coyotes too. They killed my dog, Callie, who was named after McCallister Street in San Francisco (which is where we bought her). McCallister street is also in the deeply gay neighborhood of San Francisco. My parents were worried that we might get AIDS from it, but in the word of our Vet, "Well, what are you going to use the dog for?" I was too little to remember it, but apparently the dog breeders' house was adorned with gay pornography and man-thong calenders. I guess the breeders didn't notice our "Reagan Rocks!" bumper sticker...  Today I converted 3 people to veritaserum.com!
