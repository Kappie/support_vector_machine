He's pretty silly though, so what can I expect?  River Cleanup today.  It was pretty good, especially since I met a girl who knows my cousin pretty well.  That's always cool.  I walked home from it, happy after I left but then sad realizing that was all I was doing that day.  I'm definitely not going to the night of stars, that's just a bad idea.  Whatever.... So I'm gonna sit and regret not doing anything this weekend when I could have.  I really do not want to go to Church tommorow, I'm getting pretty bored with that since we really don't learn anything overly important.  I get to hear how Pastor doesn't like Bush and how to be good to your wife in the actual service, then the good stuff really starts! Mr. Harewood talks about how Paul was friends with Timothy.  Wow, that'll help me get into heaven.   In the days that others would call Pentacost, I lived apart from many of the others, offering where I could, and taking as little as possible.  It was after doing this for sometime, that the Savior returned from the Heaven of the Tenth to speak to me.  "Why do you stay silent?" The Lord said unto me, for I had not spoken for sometime out of regret.  "Lord, you shed your blood for all of our sins, but why is it me and the Others who recieved your Soul after death?"  The Lord answered, "Why do you look to my death as granting you a gift?  If I was to die, I would have already been dead when I was born, so must have already been resurrected and have gained eternal life before the crucifixition.  For the Crucifixion wasn't murder, rather it was my soul feeding the Tree of Knowledge that grows in the center of paradise.  Rather it was me allowing the Tree of Knowledge to bloom again, so all may taste the fruit like I had."  I sat, and thought of these things for two and one more hour before I responded "But Lord, was it not the price you paid that allowed man to taste your Soul in Death, but for me and the Others to taste your spirit during life?"  The Lord grew angry hearing this, "Ye of little Knowledge! Surely trees do not grow all their fruit in an instant and drop it all of at once for the animals to eat.  The twelve have all tasted only the ripest fruit that still remains on the Tree of Knowledge.  Joyus will the day be when all the fruit can be fresh enough for all of man to enjoy as you have!"  The Lord left and did not return after this.  Some time after an Angel of the blind one whom some call Sameal came down, trying to sow the seeds of faith in the blind one in me but Sameal had not tasted of the Tree of Knowledge.
