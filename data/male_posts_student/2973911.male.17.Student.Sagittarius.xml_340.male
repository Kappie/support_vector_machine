The former is a reply to  how to interpret dreams .  The latter is to  getting your dreams interpreted through psychology sh*t and other people with templates .  I have plans for this new year:            To make a REAL website for Epoche, which is a personal site, like Rox's.  Yes, I'm full of shit, but this time, I will obligate myself. Otherwise, how could I vainly display my art?  Heheher.            To make more stories.  I had enough of autobiographies.              Save money for the rainy day.  No, actually for my new hobby (Vampire:the Eternal Struggle trading card game) which has gotten me hooked.  I would be attending a few tournaments (locally).  Hopefully.            Study Harder.  Lost my partial scholarship by .02 points on my current GWA.  I want to be scholarized to fund my vices.            Make poems and draw more.  Make a storybook version of "The Meadow of Lore" (Oh, you'll see what it is).  Even your sister could read it.  Well, that is, if Cinderella and Snow White were ever pornographic and violent.  But wait, your sister is already old enough to read so much violence.  I suggest watching "Kill Bill".  Haven't seen it, but the raves are powerful.              Write comic scripts for my brother to draw, and write more stories for the currently wishful thinking "Soul Assembly".  When I consider drugs, I think I can make a better story.              I will fulfill at least two of these this year.  Or you can kill me.  No really.  I'm not suicidal  but I do keep promises.  Not like some people out there (I'm not talking about anyone INSIDE this Blog).
