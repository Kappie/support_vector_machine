Their distant faces fade away I'm always on my own I can show a smile, It's not hard to do I can have the strength to go on But sometimes I wanna let go of everything When the thoughtfulness is not their game I teach by giving love High mountains seem higher endlessly when they're pebbles at your feet And if you should still fall into despair, there is one thing left to believe I lie in your heart always  Nothing is braver than honesty, my life is your faith in me  I'll be there when you need You don't have to hide from me What you are feeling now I fill your soul  We will seek together destiny Troubles have an end We will carry on hand in hand You're not alone  People searching desperately outside themselves, Caught up in thinking of what never helped And I'd forgotten too that love exists inside of me as in Those that I wanted from I feel you now  I'll be there when you need We will live together Nothing is in our way With trust in our soul  We will seek together destiny Troubles have an end We will carry on hand in hand We won't forget we have each other  Love is in the heart of all man You're not alone  maayas got such an angelic n soothing voice =)  well..yesterday was supposta be my big study day..cos i got home early from school..ended up staying up till 2 to finish a few study notes and stuff...at least ive got my english speech finalised... so what happened to those hours of planned study?? well..life..and people happened... first...was tam...he umm...fulfilled one desire...but...it ended up making him feel even more empty?? hmm..iunno..hes a very weird boy...tried to talk to him and all...but he cant ever lose an argument...and he doesnt like to accept other peoples point of views..and the thing he wants..is like..totally unreasonable...well...its pretty ummm...impossible i reckon...ahh well...he prolly just needed someone to talk to... and then...people start asking me physics questions!! i dont even do physics..even if it WAS year 10 stuff...dont remember doing that kinda stuff =/ ah well..helps to have friends who do physics =P do i look shifty?? cos dezza came and asked if i knew where to get new phones outright..great..outta all the people in church..i look like the one most likely to be shifty > there was someone else who was in a spot of bother as well...dw too much sweeties...always here for ya if you need me...and...if youre gonna look out for anyone..look out for yourself first..you dont do enough of that =P so whatever you decide to do...dont do it cos of what other people are gonna think or whatever...should be bout what and how you feel bout it...and whatever you do decide...imma support you all the way!! and im sure heapsa ppl will as well =) feel better soon *hugZ*  so yea..im the end..didnt get as much study as i expected to get done..ah well...like ive always said..people do come first...always =)  im missing my mummy =( shes only been gone one day as well > missing her cooking...even its not top notch..still missing it..missing her barging into my room with the laundry and stuff...missing her making me lunch (i cant make sandwiches for crap!! > ahh well..she'll be back tomorrow..i think i'll survive wouldnt know what id do without her =D  this might be my last 'deep' and long post for awhile..unless i have heaps spectactular amazing fun huge unforgettable important days during the trials...i'll still report in everyday if i can though =) english speech and jap written/listening tomorrow...4min speech...3hour jap test...i dont think im able to sit still in a seat for an hour and speeches just shit me > ah well..wish me luck!! ^^
