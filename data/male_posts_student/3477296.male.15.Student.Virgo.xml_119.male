There were:  3 short talks... (i thought they were pretty simple, but they were to the point)   Jumping Castle!  - I thought this was the best part! so much fun... (bak in the old days...)   Heaps of food... (specially Rice!)   Prizes (tho we din't get much)   n last of all... since we're all azn,  "Good value for money" .  Anyways.. i thought that it was real good! If you've missed out on this event, well...  "better luck next year"   Seriously, now. If you've missed out on this event, then at least go to the second one...  "Where is the love?" . This event will probably be bigger n better than the RICEfest, n will be a real great night! If you still havn't been notified bout it... then go to  urlLink rice.hypox.org  to get info.   See ya there!
