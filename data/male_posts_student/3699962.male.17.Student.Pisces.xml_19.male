Which means I'm still at the O level standard. Econs, I topped the class, but the results weren't great anyway - a 47%. A bare A level pass. And guess what? I FAILED GP!!! AHHHH!!! And the best part? By one mark!!! 44%!  But that's not gonna get me down. I won't let it. And that's not the problem... About other stuff though, sometimes one has to wonder why me and why  not  me. I'm not gonna wallow in self-pity, but like I said. sometimes one has to wonder why.  I hate to have such an entry after awhile, but yeah.  I know I have to trust. Trust God. And I'll try...
