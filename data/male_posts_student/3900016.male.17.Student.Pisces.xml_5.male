You may know him from his newest flick "Fahrenheit 911" which basically just rips on George W. Bush and how he sent troops to Iraq/Afghanistan. O'Reilly found him on the street at the Democratic Conventionand he asked why he wouldn't come on his show. Well...the long and the short of it is that Moore was scared, because he knew O'Reilly would tear him apart. Well...the debate turned out to be quite fair and well played. Although both sides made some dumb comments. If you go to  urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/ then you should be able to either search or find the video of it. At the time of this posting the video can be seen by clicking on the picture of Michael Moore to the right of the page. I urge you to see it and comment on it here in my "blog".  Wow I love that word.
