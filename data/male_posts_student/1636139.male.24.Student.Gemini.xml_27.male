My team went out for a lunch buffet at this Indian restaurant called Sue's. OK, so Sue isn't really an authentic-sounding Indian name but neither is Tony. The food was pretty authentic, anyway; some of the best vegetarian food I've ever tasted. 
  
There was a big meeting today so that all the outgoing interns could share their valuable insights with the incoming ones. We planned a few intern activities for the term, shared tips for making the most of the term, compared the previous term with what this one promises to be  generally raised the usual ruckus. 
  
After getting home, I went to the gym with my roommate. There were some random Sun employees playing volleyball outside the gym so, naturally, I joined in  we played until it got dark. Then I went inside  pumped iron until I was exhausted. Quite a busy day.
