Microsoft, and many other companies, are sitting on oceans of cash because the stock holders don't want to take the cash as a dividend due to the Capital Gains.  The money is sitting in low yield instruments, not really doing much.  Now that money will break loose and start circulating, doing what money is designed to do.
