I wanna put a gun thingy in my backpack so every time someone tries to steal something from it, they'll find their head across the room. Uh...damnit this afternoon sucked. I spent most of it drumming also. I didn't do so good today because I'm so god damn tired from going to hell everyday. They should rename school to SHIT or HELL or PLACE THAT SUCKS ASS...PTSA...haha PSAT...nevermind. Now I'm studing AP Euro, fun, lots of fun. I know it all, it's too easy. Ok later people.
