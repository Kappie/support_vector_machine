Well, today I finished reading the book of the same title, written by the man himself twenty years before the movie was released. Abagnale comments in the afterword of the book that the movie is actually eighty-percent truth, changing his family structure, omitting impersonations and prison time, and changing the times and locations of some events.   If you're not familiar with the story, Frank Abagnale was one of the most daring con men, forgers, impostors, and escape artists in history. During his criminal career, Abagnale posed as a co-pilot for Pan-Am using a fake ID and pilot's license, impersonated a pediatrician at a hospital, practiced law and assisted the district attorney of Georgia without a license, passed himself off as a sociology professor at Brigham Young University, and passed over $2.5 million in phony checks, all before the age of twenty-one.   What's truly amazing, however, is how Abagnale was able to reform himself after his life of crime, turning his talent for forging checks into a business, and becoming a legitimate millionaire on his own. It's one of those stranger-than-fiction stories that you still can't believe after you read it.
