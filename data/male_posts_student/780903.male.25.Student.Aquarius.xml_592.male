"Tort People" (to the tune of Randy Newman's "Short People")  Tort People got no reason Tort People got no reason Tort People got no reason To frown  They got little tears In their eyes Sit on the stand Tellin' great big lies So they get little jurors To which no one objects To buy their little stories  And give them great big checks  Well, I don't want no Tort People Don't want no Tort People Don't want no Tort People Suing me  Tort People are just the same As you and I (Well, an injured you and I) All men have lawyers For the day they "almost die" (It's a litigious world)  Tort People got nobody Tort People got nobody Tort People got nobody Left to sue  They get little injuries And they find someone to blame Call it a class action And add name after name after name They get little experts That go blah, blah, blah With their great big voices Juries left in awe They got grubby little fingers And dirty little minds They're gonna get you every time  Well, I don't want no Tort People Don't want no Tort People Don't want no Tort People 'Round here
