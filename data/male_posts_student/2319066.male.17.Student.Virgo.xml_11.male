Had decent food there, the food is the reason that went.  Got up at 11:30 this morning to go to the staff lunch thingy.  It was fun.  I got to see Laura, which always makes me have a good day.  Had goood food there.  Saw a lot of people from last night, and some people that I had not seen for a while.  After that I have just been sitting around at home and reading blogs.  That is all for today.  See ya.
