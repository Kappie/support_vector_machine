For those who've been living in the dark for the past 3 or 4 months, Gmail( urlLink www.gmail.com ) is a free online e-mail service from Google that offers 1GB of e-mail storage (compared to 2MB offered by Hotmail) and a bunch of cool, new features. Right now you can only sign up by invitation, but soon the service will be available to everybody.  Upon first inspection, I must say that Gmail is indeed incredible! User interface is very simple and effective. Nothing too fancy, which is great: KISS(keep it simple, stupid) principle at play here.   So far I find Gmail to be lot more usable than Hotmail. Everything that can be done with 1 or 2 mouse clicks in Gmail, requires 4 or 5 clicks in Hotmail. Pretty big difference if you ask me.   Gmail is also a lot faster than Hotmail. For Google's sake I hope that they will be able to maintain such high speeds even when the service goes public.   Unfortunately, since the Gmail is still in beta version there are bunch of nasty bugs. I've already sent Gmail guys some feedback about that, and I expect those bugs to be fixed soon.
