He delivered a great speech. It war rousing, respectful, and inspiring. He joked a little bit in the beginning about the 2000 election and the recounts. He mentioned the word "Bush" only once. He laid out the case for Bush's re- defeat. All in all, it was a good speech. We are now waiting for former President Jimmy Carter in about 10 minutes.  *I will come back to blog later in the night and throughout the week to give my thoughts.
