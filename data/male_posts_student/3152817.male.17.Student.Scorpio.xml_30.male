What will it take to win the war?  Only the incredibly insane liberals out there (the ones like  urlLink Ted Rall  and  urlLink Michael "Stupid White Man" Moore )still think the Battle of Afghanistan was a mistake.  They refuse to see that as a result of the war, Al Quida has been severely disrupted, the people of Afghanistan have been liberated from the oppressive Taliban regime, and our homeland is one battle closer to security from terror.    The next battle in this global war is currently being fought in Iraq.  The insane leftists who opposed eliminating Al Quida leaders in Afghanistan, have been joined by more the moderate liberals, in denouncing the continuing fight to guarantee the safety and securityof our nation.  Seriously, what do these people think the insurgents in Iraq would be doing if they weren’t fighting our military men and women?   (Well they’d be at home, beating…, I mean “taking care" of their wives and children of course.  If you actually believe that, I've got an ocean front property in Kansas for sale.)  Those same terrorists, who are dieing by the hundreds each week, would be planning more attacks against our homeland.  Attacks even more horrible than 9/11.   As much as liberals and isolationists would like to believe it, it would be impossible to completely secure the borders of the United States.  At least 500,000,000 people pass through our nation each year.  Millions of crates are shipped into our ports annually and only 6% (at most) can be inspected, without bankrupting the government.   The only way to protect ourselves from terrorists, is to take the fight to them.    Because of our actions in Iraq, positive change can be seen around the world.  Protesters in Iran are demanding freedom and democracy more than they ever have before.  Libya has given up its WMD program for fear that they may be next.  Even North Korea has allowed IAEA agents in to inspect their nuclear program.  How can any logical person say that the Global War on Terror hasn’t been a huge success so far?
