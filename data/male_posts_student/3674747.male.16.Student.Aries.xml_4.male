It seemed as if a mysterious "chemistry effect" has suddenly developed to draw you closer to her.       You two then began to meet regularly, and you discover more things that you admire about her, her clever ideas, her healthy values and the way she stands up for you when others doubt you, you find yourself thinking of her not just as a normal friend, but a very good friend.       It is often during this period that a boy and a gal will start thinking of bringing their friendship to another level. After all, the kind of wonderful experience you have between each other can only become even better if it develops into unique… no one else seems able to replace her in your heart… so both of you agree to go steady and work even harder on the relationship, you guys "graduate" to become a couple, and are the envy of the sea of singles.       However… at some point in your relationship, you forgot how it all began. You start to take your partner for granted… why can't she laugh in a more ladylike manner? Why doesn't she dress herself more trendily? Why must she assert her views and point out your silly mistakes? Is she really the one for you?       To be fair to yourself and to her, take some time to reflect on your "love memory". The "love memory' contains all the reasons that you fell in love with her right from Day One. It contains rarely accessed snippets of how your life has changed since meeting and loving her.       Pre-steady days, did you heap compliments on her for the brave way she spoke her mind on bullies and snobs? You probably did. Did you like her unusual fashion sense that makes her stand out from the crowd?       Right-o. So why are you criticizing or finding fault with her now that she is your girlfriend? Because you have forgotten the fundamentals of love… like so many of us. You have forgotten the reasons you admired her during the friendship phase… instead… once you went steady… you put your "love memory" in cold storage…       As her boyfriend, you take up a new set of demands and expectations about her. These new ideas are not necessarily better; they could put your relationship at risk…       A healthy relationship, like learning to walk properly, follows a step-by-step development; you can't possibly become part of a couple if you aren't friend in the first place. Ok, I know some of us break the rule and plunge straight into whirlwind courtship, but how many of those couples can go the distance? Couple hood works well when there is something you like about her (and vice versa), and I’m not referring to merely the physical aspects… dun think too hard huh!       So whenever your relationship hits a rocky path, don't give up without checking on your "love memory"… rediscover the reasons why you fell in love with her, and watch your relationship flourish with a newfound vigor.       Love is to listen to the needs of the other party: giving without asking for returns… overlook the faults and find the plus point of the other party… voice out  say sweet things and express your happiness and words of encouragement for the other party, just like me giving kisses to the person I like… kekekee… putting in effort, keep putting in more time to find the world of love…   Give comments....^^
