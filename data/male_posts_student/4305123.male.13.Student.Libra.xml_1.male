After this one-night, two-day stay in Seattle, I'll be in Edmonton, but my grandparents have a PC so I'll be able to update it from there.  We're (my little bro, me, and my dad) probably going to the Boeing factory for a tour, and going to check out a lot of bookstores as well. Eat some Krispy Kremes, you know. We'll also check out the Sci Fi Museum and the Music museum, which is always cool. Plus the kickass mall, with the monorail. Damn, that thing is cool.  Some more friend's blogs:  Natasha's         http://xsugarxbabex.blogspot.com/ Brad's              http://bassmasta69.blogspot.com/ Garrett's          http://www.livejournal.com/users/fearrett/  Just got back from a barbeque at my friend's dad Don's house. Played some pool, and croquette, and ate grilled chicken. There was this one hot babe there, but she was:  1. Outta my league 2. 16-17  So, sadly, it was moderately lame. Especially since we had to leave early so my mom and grandmother can pack for the Edmonton trip tomorrow. (They're going two days earlier than us.)  You can see below I tried updating a pic into the blog-it worked pretty well, but it stuck out at the side a little. After I finish going through my Europe trip pix, I'll put some up here. Having a digital camera really induces a disgusting amount of picture taking... I had two whole CDs worth of pictures.  Just gonna talk about webcomics for a bit-basically just normal comics, except on the web. I'll list a couple of my favorites here, and most of them have a story, so you should find the archives or click the "first post" button so you can read them from the beginning:  http://www.elgoonishshive.com/ http://www.squidi.net/index.php http://www.chugworth.com/comic.php http://catmydog.keenspace.com/ http://loserz.scribblekid.org/ http://www.truenuff.com/index.php (Based in Vancouver! The comic has stopped being normally updated, so the only thing left is archives.) http://www.theponderingmonkey.com/ (Same deal as above.) http://www.questionablecontent.net/index.php http://www.redmeat.com/redmeat/current/index.html http://www.whiteninjacomics.com/comics.shtml http://www.ghastlycomic.com/ (May not be appropriate for easily offended people or under 13s.) http://turnsignalsonalandraider.com/ (40k comic)  Well, there you go. Enjoy.  I've decided I'm going to write a haiku in each of my blog entries, so here we go.  White printer paper Ink smells like dry crisp lemons Mom is printing something  :p  Signing off.
