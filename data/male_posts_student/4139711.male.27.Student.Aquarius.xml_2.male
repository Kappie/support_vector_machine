Some may find this sexist, but then again most modern femma-natzi enlightenment thinkers will find the bible patriarchal and archaic.  All orthodox christians must repudiate this. What does 1 Peter 3:7 mean when it says;" Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honour to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you[Some manuscripts [since you are joint heirs] ] of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered." What does weaker mean and how does one show honour to her?  Well weaker infact means weaker (well what did you expect).  It is likened to a china teacup to a tin dipper.  The china is far more delicate, it will smash if dropped.  The old tin dipper can be thrown around with impunity.  But...  the china is far more valuable and will be treasured (as it should be)> so men rather than dominating their wives and demanding submission, should instead treasure, protect and care for these special daughters of God.  That is how the male biblically honours. Feminism has tried to destroy this paradigm.  In its quest to make women equal it has only lowered woman.  The command is given for mutual submission as well as treating others as better than onself.  The quest for equality is a direct attack on these scriptures.  I am not equal to you, you are by far better than me. This degrading of woman has made our society the sexually perverted place that it is. The door was opened and all hell broke loose through. Men have their place in the kingdom of God, and so do women.  It is mans place to be the pastor/preacher and it is womans place to be the mother.  These are both valid motivations.  So when in class I vigourously deny women the right to preach I am doing it out of a desire to lift up women not to lower them.  Remember 1 Cor 12:22 "On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable"  The job that women play in the church are indispensable.  Men should not want womans God ordained jobs and vice versa.. Beloved fellow members of our holy mother church, let us recapture a biblical framework for the dealings with the sexes.  All of the strife between sexes are a result of the fall (it was the second seperation, man/God, man/woman).  We must go back to the regulative principal in interpersonal/ecclesiastical matters dealing with the sexes.  Guys let us love women enough to gently guide them into submission.  Girls love men enough to allow this.  People of God love Jehovah enough to submit to His ordained roles for you. Grace
