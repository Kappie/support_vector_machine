I'm checking my e-mail at a computer in the library here at school, and decided to quickly check another weblog I sometimes link to written by a fellow HLS student.  And I notice there's all sorts of options on the page that aren't usually there.  Seems as if he must have posted from this machine earlier today and didn't log out.  I resisted any urge to tamper, of course, and did him a favor and logged him out.  But what a fun coincidence.
