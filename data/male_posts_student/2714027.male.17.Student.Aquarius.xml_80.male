It went much better than my previous Mechanics exam, with a distinct lack of having to cope with hayfever at the same time as answering the questions. The exam wasn't really that hard, just tough on the time we were given.  Meanwhile, the builders came in this morning and have torn apart our bathroom, removing our shower in the process. We're no stranger to building work - it's the third extension to this house - but this time they've taken the shower! Going round to other peoples' houses to wash - not fun.  On a more sober note, yesterday was of course the 60th anniversary of D-Day; quite a thought provoker in itself. It was the largest combined air, land and sea operation ever and I don't think it's going to be outdone for hundreds of years. The sheer amount of co-operation between nations, the scope, ambition and secrecy needed would be impossible today in a world of mass media, high-tech communication and such split causes. Back then, the world united against one foe and they believed that what they were doing was right. I don't think that exists today at all and that's a real shame.
