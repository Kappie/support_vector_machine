Even thou everyone knew #1 would be Jimi Hendrix, and he was, but the dead-give-away was that Jimi Hendrix was on the cover. I'm not saying I don't like Jimi Hendrix, I just saying, well, he is the #1 guitarist ever!   Anyways, my brother and I discussed who should have been in the top 100. There's Billy Corgan from The Smashing Pumpkins and Zwan, Stevie Van Zant from The E-Street Band, both guitarists from Pearl Jam (not Eddie Vedder, the other two), and Mick Jone from The Clash. All and all, it was a fairly good list. They had Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine, Frank Zappa, and Jack White of The White Stripes whom came in at 17! Pretty damn good for a guitarist who's still alive.   I must say, Rolling Stone Magazine has stayed hip, as in sticking with Rock and Punk music unlike shitty MTV. Well if you are into rock, check out the article and see if you agree whid-it, aeeet?
