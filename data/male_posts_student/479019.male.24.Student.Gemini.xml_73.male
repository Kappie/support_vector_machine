I'm up pass 12 AM with out the slightest bit of fatigue. I should probably put that energy into finally getting my statement of purposes for my last shot at grad school for next fall done... but I dunno... I want to do something, but I just don't know what.  In rotation right now...  White Stripes , the  Hives ,  T(I)NC , and the  Strokes ... a nice mix of garage stuff.  ***
