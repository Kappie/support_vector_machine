I'm glad that people now has a gateway into my mind but I also regret letting in the people who just don't understand. And I mean u, creature. Everything u've said has been a judgement on the way I've chosen to live and the way I've chosen to write. Frankly, I don't care what u think. This blog is about me for a reason. I made it to be about me. Now, if u have a problem with that, stfu and go to hell.  As for M, thanx. That means alot to me... And I'm sry about calling u smug... and cute... I'm just paraphrasing what the chinese parents say... U no, dimples and all... I can imagine getting my ass kicked,  shudders . Anyways, I hope L and H reads it too.  Really though, I'm sick of it. I've heard it at school so I don't wanna hear it here. What I should do and what I shouldn't do, what I've done wrong and what I've done right. Get this into ur head: That is not what this blog is about. I'm tired of getting judged. I made this blog to feel relief from my anxieties and to be comforted, not to be bombarded by judements made by people who have a problem with how I live. From now on, negative comments better be constructive criticism in my eyes, or I'll flame ur ass out of here. That's right, this is where I have power.  Now, I want to note something about that "most important thing in life" thing I wrote a couple of days ago. I just want to make sure that no one confuses that as synonymous towards the "meaning of life". The meaning of life is something for each and every one of us to discover for themselves. That journey to discover it is what we call life. Therefore, the most important thing in life is to enjoy that "journey" and not regret it afterwards. IOW, be happy.  Sometimes, I do wish that I can control my own happiness, which is impossible since I'm not even sure what'll make me happy. All my fantasies have been about revenge and death is always involved in it. I've never even tried to imagine myself happy. I wish I could just be more optimistist once in a while.  Anyways, I got tons of hw, so I'm off, cya.
