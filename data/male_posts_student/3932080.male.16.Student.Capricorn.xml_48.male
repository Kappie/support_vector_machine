Andr√© "Ice Cold" 3000 and Alicia Silverstone are officially PETA's  Hottest Vegetarians  for staying away from meat. As for other awards, PETA continued to name Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen the  Hottest Anorexics  (because they forget which one was which). And, in a dramatic finale, Ken Jennings (new gameshow millionaire) was named  Hottest Jeopardian  because he follows a strict diet of "Trebek dick."
