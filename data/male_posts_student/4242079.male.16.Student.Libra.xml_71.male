You said the words I wanted to hear, but I'm not sure if they had the desired effect. I thought they'd make me feel better about my current situation, instead, they made me feel worse. I realize now, you're going through much the same as I am, except I still believe I see things a little more clearly than you do. I honestly believe that in a while, months, years, maybe even decades, you will think back to this. You are confused right now, and I think someday, after you've done a lot of growing up, you will realize what you've done, and what you had. And I'm fine with that. I may or may not still be waiting for you.  Today, I played Monopoly. I've only ever finished that game twice. Today was not one of them. I watched a fuck load of television today. I needed to turn my brain off. She told my parents her age. I can just imaging the talking to I will be getting tomorrow. I will tell them I will just sit in my room and drink whiskey instead.
