I have nothing intelligent to say, no deep thoughts, and no greater meaning.  I have failed!  I therefore doubt this will ever be updated, however I, at this moment in which I declare my hate for blogs, find myself rejecting food, a hobby, to type.  Shit, I've lost my mind!  This will, then, be for me. All poor souls who stumble upon this may be better off looking away- far, far, FAR away- deep into the shoes of the most isolated of clowns. It will be a study; a more independent view of myself. I may try my damnedest to be honest but since that is what I scope to learn I may struggle.  Again I say, If you have found this random, assorted, vile collage of thoughts, RUN!!! If you care to read on, do so, it obviously doesn't bother me.  Today, in case you want to know, my poor soul, would have been a    yellow    balloon...
