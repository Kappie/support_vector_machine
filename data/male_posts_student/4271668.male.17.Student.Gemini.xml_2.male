She says every guy she has ever trusted has hurt her.  I know I have and I don't know if I will ever be able to forgive myself.  I am not worthy of her.  Now she likes another guy.  If he will make her happy I suport him completely.  But I keep on thinking that there is no way that he will love her as much as I do.  I know that I am suposed to get over her, I wish I could.  I am completely broke.  I have no money to spend on anything.  Even if I thought that I would stand a chance with her I couldn't have done it due to lack of funds.  I still dream about her, but it's not like what you think.  I dream about her saying that she loves me, or just us holding hands, even our wedding.  I know that none of these dreams will come true.  I wish with all my might that they would but I know they won't.  Bye for now.
