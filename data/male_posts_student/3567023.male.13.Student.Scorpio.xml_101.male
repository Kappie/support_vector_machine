Uber Stev: No because he doesn't know how to spell, or is just a lazy bump on a log. Alison: No because she doesn't want to. Garrett: No because he is an annoying "nerd" that has a mullett. Dana: No because she continually asks pointless questions and never posts. Paula: No because she is always confused, hyper, and in desperate need of help. Nathan: No because he already is an admin. Myself: No because my goal is to undermine everyone else's campaign platform.  Thank You All For Listening To Me Today!
