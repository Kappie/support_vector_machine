Originally published in French, this book is a psychological masterpiece, and classic enough to survive translation. It brought to mind the flavor of Dostoevsky’s  Brothers Karamozov , or the lucid, disarming self-awareness of Montaigne…but published originally in 1937. In the words of  The New York Times Book Review , “It is a strange and sad, yet a beautiful and compelling story.” Bittersweet indeed. A modern masterpiece. (And I’m not Catholic.) If you do consider reading this book, which you should, keep in mind that it’s one of those   urlLink  Books Not Everyone Is Smart Enough To Read   , both for its inadequate recognition and somewhat challenging dialogue. (There are some passages you’ll need to read twice.) So prepare accordingly.       - Originally posted on   urlLink  BitterSweetLife   .
