The Passion of the Christ !! Oh my goodness. If you haven't seen this movie! GO AND SEE IT. I'm telling you that this is awesome. It's so powerful and moving that I can hardly stand it (in a good way, that is). I can't write anything about the movie because there are simply no words to describe what you see. I like what Billy Graham said, "Mel Gibson has accompished in 2 hours, what I have tried to accomplish in 40 years."  All I can say is, it was beautiful. I'm not saying that this is everything now, but it really gets you thinking. It's like they had a video camera back then.  But I'm telling you. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. You're just crazy if you don't.
