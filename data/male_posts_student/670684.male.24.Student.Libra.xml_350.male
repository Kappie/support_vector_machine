An 18+page treatment in three days...about the equivalent of 12 pages of script a day.  Incredible progress.  We'll see how it's taken to.    I'd like to post it and other progress on the script on my other website, but copyright issues rear themselves...I'm looking at registering this script through WGA, and if I do that I think we're cool.
