Lavalon is now well on its way to having an all-new website. I have  just logged into our new web space, which is being provided by the  EXCELLENT HostCubix.com. Not only is this web hosting, but web services  as well. We will have 50 megs and e-mail adresses also.  Over the next weeks I will keep everyone updated on the website  developments.  Hopefully Lavalon will end up with its own domain name. But before we  do that, I've been thinking about Lavalon's name sounding a little too,  lets just say "lavender". That's right, all citizens can now suggest a  new name for Lavalon. A really cool name might get us many more  citizens.  Xon
