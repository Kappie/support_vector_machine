It didn't exactly work, so I'm stuck with it all today, and homework and GARGH!  So Kaya came over, and when she came in I got an annoyed feeling off of her. She didn't seem to want to be here, so I felt really wierd. Which in turn (most likely) made her feel wierd, and caused much confusion, chaos, and un-needed awkwardness. We went to the beach, and I was really exhausted from the night before, and just felt like sitting down. So, Kaya thought I was mad/angry/sad/??? and things got a bit wierder. So I got really really really thirsty, so we went on a mission, first to hot dog on a stick, because of the lemonade. The line at hot dog on a stick was huge, so we decided to go to the mall. We don't really like the mall, so we just decided to go home. At home we decided that we both needed to relax. A friend of hers (Brooke) Had pot from the night before. So we drove over there to get it. We smoked one bowl...I felt a little sick (breakfast, mom cooked the food a little too raw) so I didn't want to smoke any more. Kaya said she didn't feel really high...it was just wierd pot. Didn't get you high. Just made you tired. Hungry. But not all giggly. So we started the Emperors new groove, and all of a sudden, I was rediculously horny. This pot made me fucking horny as hell! So we got down to buisness.......I don't know how to put it. I think she was offended by something I did. I dunno. Sorry for being so wierd yesterday. I had rotten breakfast two days iin a row. ~Elan p.s Comments?
