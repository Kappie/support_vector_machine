In other news I dug up a O/S map remember a dream I had many years ago. I look out of my bed room window and realize that the true love on my life lies out in that very direction. So I go off to find her - I can't see it from my window but I soon discover that to reach her I must cross some very steep hills but eventually I find her in a small one roomed hovel and we live happily ever after. Now this dream occurred 5 years ago I estimate but it holds significance for two reasons;  -5 degrees in the direction of my window lies the house of an ex-girlfriend [who happens to live in a bungalow [the closest to a hovel really in terms of size]... I once cycled to her and discovered the route to involve going up [and down] many hills  +10 degrees in the direction my window lives a close friend who lives very far away and subsequently between us lie many hills  While the second is a very vague coincidence I can't help to shake off a feeling on the first one may have a little fate in it... just a shame her title is  ex -girlfriend.
