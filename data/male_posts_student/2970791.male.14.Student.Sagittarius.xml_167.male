If you don't know what it is, it's the nerdiest pencil and paper game on the face of the Earth, but it's fun.  I was thinking that a grout of people would get together at my house every friday or something and mess around and play and whatnot.  It's mainly to stay in touch, and if you want to play, just post something.  Happy nerdiness!
