I listen and hear but just don’t see why Everything they say just makes me so tense.  Don’t feel like a bad kid, but I guess I am. Am I really as bad as that kid, Sam? They always convince me they think so. What and when is too far to pull? What should I do? I just don’t know.  Wow, what has this life ever done for me? What I’ve done right is hard to see. It just seems to be all work and no play. They ignore and don’t listen to me Why should I listen to what they have to say?  Then again is my life all that bad? They might yell but what luck have I had? Doesn’t that count more than the initial fall? Wait, yes, it is as bad as I thought For I’ve got no good luck at all.  But look at all the people that I know. Kindness and friendship dare they show? It’s a friend I’ve been waiting for all this time, To sooth the hurt and ease the pain. It’s a friend I’ve wanted since before this rhyme.  Will it soon be for the last time? Will it be more sour than a lime? Will I fall down and out again? Will I fall down and out in the end? Will I fall or will someone lend a hand?  Please catch me.  OK. That was one of the first poems I wrote and I hadn't had a chance to copy it over to this site... So there, with a few revisions.
