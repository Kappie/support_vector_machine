Last night I downloaded some  Unwritten Law . Their self-titled from 1998. That's actually a pretty good album. They had more edge on that release. "Teenage Suicide" is a good example. It's just a killer song.  Other thoughts? I just feel so whatever right now. I feel like I'm just trying to get to the  Millencolin  show and back California. Everything else is simply just so plain right now. I mean it's exactly 3 weeks, 21 days, until I'm home. I still have a lot of work to get done... 33 pages of writing... but with the dreary weather... I have no energy or anything to balance the work with. I'm the type of person, who without balance in all aspects of life, can't get anything done.  **
