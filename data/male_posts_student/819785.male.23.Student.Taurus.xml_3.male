Only got to do a 2-hour practical tomorrow though, and it's an easy one cos it's only Visual Basic. Everyone thinks I'm mad cos I'm learning C, Perl and VB all at the same time - but it's not really that hard. With C and Perl the syntax is almost identical, and VB is just good for learning how to handle events and objects, stuff like that.  I've started mentoring for one of the other students today as well, he's struggling with Perl a bit. Think personally he's concentrating too much on the wrong things, he was going on about how he runs the scripts from home - basically uploading them to his uni webspace and running it from there.... and on that side of things, he just lost me. Talk about making life difficult for yourself! Maybe I'm just lucky, cos I  get  it.  Because our tutors only stay with us for the first hour of each 2-hour long practical session, we're unmonitored a lot of the time. So I wound up helping yet another student, who's missed most of the sessions up to now, with her work. I seem to be becoming the sort of person other students come to for help, which is cool - glad I'm appreciated! I just wish I was better at explaining stuff, sometimes I think that the points I'm trying to make are just going straight over their heads - but hell, I'm not a tutor!  Hopefully going to be playing Max Payne 2 by the end of the night. If it's anywhere near as good as it's meant to be (and as good as it looks), then I'm going to be needing to change my pants. I'll write a review of it if I can be bothered, and upload it to either this site or my main one.  Anyway, that's it from me for now, catch you all later.
