Angie came down with a nasty case of tropical frostbite, otherwise known medically as  urlLink tonsilitis . Cue much mopping of her fevered brow!  Managed to get quite a few pictures taken in and around Ipswich of which I'll be posting a few as and when I get time.  Also, after a request from Mr Cawte -  Ireland's 2nd most greatly received import  (after Miss Herring), I shall be posting a tribute to the wonderful game of  Stairball . Possibly one of the greatest games ever invented.
