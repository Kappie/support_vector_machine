The moment of silence was supposed to be at 10:30am cst and nobody told us. Calls stopped coming in at about 10:30am and everyone was confused. Was there a problem? No one knew. It wasn't until 10:37am that we received an e-mail telling us about the moment of silence.   Apparently, the person who sent out the e-mail was told that the moment was supposed to be at 11:30am. She didn't realize that whoever sent the e-mail meant eastern standard time, not central.   "Sto√ü mich baby noch ein mal!"
