I can't get enough of it, even though it is 8 minutes and 21 seconds long. It is a great rhapsody, kinda like Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody and Led Zepellin's Stairway to Heaven. It is kinda confusing. I think it may have something to do with Christ...though I am not entirely sure what the hell it means - I only know it is great.  Today was a great day. I actually got along with my sister and enjoyed her company! This morning for an hour or so, we listened to music in the Reading/Music Room. It was really cool. We kinda talked about how we both like classic rock. I am proud of her. Then we went to lunch because I was in a good mood and guess what! We actually had fun! I couldn't believe it.  I got through 100 pages of my last summer reading book: A Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Even though I kinda used unethical methods - and going behind my mother's back methods - I am not to worried. I told one of my friends something today. It was taken kinda much worse than I hoped it would, but Oh well.  [Blank]  will get over it pretty damn soon, even though  [blank]  might think me kinda funny about it.
