One step is all it took; One step off a stoic bridge. Into the water you went, Water under a sad bridge.  And now you're gone, oh so gone. I never will see you again. You're gone, oh so gone. Never said goodbye to you.  All those midnight drives, The rain pouring on the windshield. Lightning crashing in the distance, And in my mind.  All those tears that I have shed, Praying for help from God. Sobbing for hours on my bed, Only to cry myself to sleep.  And now you're gone, oh so gone. I never will see you again. You're gone, oh so gone. Never said goodbye to you.  All those midnight strolls. Wandering in the moonlight, Not lost, but not found. Searching for a reason for this mess.  All those things that I have said, Everything that was a lie. Searching for someone to blame, Instead of moving on with life.  And now you're gone, oh so gone. I never will see you again. You're gone, oh so gone. Never said goodbye to you.  All those things I never said Never said I Love You. All those things I never said, And now, you're dead.  -January 25, 2004 I've found it works quite well with "Too Bad" by Nickelback.  I also found that "Sooner or Later" by Fastball goes good with my poem "Locks", which i refuse to put in this blog.  As i said, this poem is for adam, and i think i'm gonnna print a copy for him.  The last stanza I just added at 3:30 today but I've been thinking about it, rephrasing it in my head since my shower this morning. All in all there are now 40 lines (not counting blank ones between stanzas).
