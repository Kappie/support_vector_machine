This afternoon, me and my mom went to the Forum (it's a big nice shopping center over off Peachtree Parkway in Norcross) to get my aunt a birthday present and then went to Harry's to get something for dinner.  Tonight I'm going out with Britt and Ashley.  It will be nice to finally go do something again, albeit not with the person I had originally intended, but as always, she was busy, and I know she can't help it, so it doesn't piss me off.  I called Britt earlier...hahaha, it's crazy that when I call him I end up talking to Ashley more than him.  I hate to talk on the phone when my mom is around because she tells me I shouldn't say things that I say because she can't detect sarcasm worth a damn.  Anyway I'm gonna go play guitar and then eat dinner and then go out and have a damn good time because I haven't seen my best friends in over 3 weeks.  Later.
