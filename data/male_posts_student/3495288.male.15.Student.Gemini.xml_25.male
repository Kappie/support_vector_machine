I was cargo with a bunch of other kids from all those countries that had export their misery.   ...Story as iremember it, mostly feelings and impressions.  Like a painting withonly colours, lights and no lines.   I remember the Ghetto called the cauldron.  Very sad, dark place where Marchello forced us to work  but i was lucky, i had a friend.   Frac was like no one else in the cauldron.  Hahah... He had a funny hat,creepy hair, a white face andrumoredhad said it was tattooed on his face butFrac said it was STAR DUST.  Hmph... he gave me hope but a dangerous thing hope is when you have nothing.   Frac was the kid i could not affordto be.  He was unpredictable, Deliriously happy one dayDesperately sadthe next.   In every city, there is a placelike a cauldron where people like me and Frac end up.  Everything is bought and sold, where tourists go, like toa freak show, to view our misery and feel better about them self.   The tourist could afford everything, cruelty, tears, cheap drama.   All i found were swirling galaxies of memories in an empty room.  Frac had left without telling anyone not even me.   I never seen Frac like this.  Something in his eyes, something in the girl's eye, nothing can never be the same.   They were part of the circus coming to town, but to me they all look like they hadcome from different planets,E.T.s fallen to Earth discovering humans the first time.   "No Father i am sure of what i saw, how can it be possible?. A man and a childwanted to die. Maybe we could have helped?", Said the girl.   I should havehadfelt happy for Frac but i was angry, What did i care if he had fell in love instead of dyeing, if i were wasn't part of it. There was no place for me in his LOVE STORY.   -To be Continue-  *Please note that this quotes have something related to what i have to say but i wish not to as it between the special someone and me.
