You know Binghamton is really in the boonies when it is one of the only Verizon phone markets that don't offer voice mail service.  Anyway I figured out that I should just get all my calls forwarded to my cell phone, since that has all the nifty caller ID and voice mail services already.  Well I was at least somewhat productive on my "day off." I seriously feel like my body has been put in a blender for the past week and a half. Mentally I've been out of it and physically I feel sore and weak. I really don't know what it is. Vitamin deficiency? A virus of some sort? I managed to get some writing done, which is good seeing as how I have 6 weeks of school left. I actually have good chunks of writing down. They're disorganized and mostly brain stormish paragraphs, but 10 pages worth of  something  is something. That's in addition to the 6 I already handed in. So basically I have 50 pages left to do. 10 a week? Damn it I better get cracking.  I didn't let this rice steam long enough, but my steak was already done. That's what I get for not timing things right.  **
