It was a three hour long test; it felt like it took all day.  Well, in other news, I am trying to find a way to next years Anime Boston. I am trying to get Mike to go with me, but I don't think he wants to. If there is anyone out there in computer land that has any ideas leave a comment. Maybe I can get money off of DBGT.com, sorta like a collection for money. On the subject of DBGT.com I just found out today that it's closed until the beginning of July. That means deadlines, and maybe money :D.  Well my parade is tomorrow, which really blows. I think I will stay up really late tonight, so I will be tired tomorrow. Good idea right? Yep, I thought so. I will be in Yahoo Yaoi chats tonight so you can catch me there if you wanna chat. My yahoo sn is supergasaraki.  Well, in my personal life I ignored Kym today. I talked to Ryan for the first time in a week, and I got raped by a monkey. Tricked ya, you didn't see that one coming did ya?  My cousin is coming up from Florida next week. It will be the first time I have seen him in like two years. I don't think I like him very much, but I'm not sure. I'll let you know next week. I am running out of material for my blog, so I am going to start a story. It will be a 4 part story, one part for every day in the next two weeks. It will be a yaoi fanfiction of "Saiyuki". I will call it "Saiyuki: Goku and Hakkia's Confrontation" I will post the first part tonight, until then TTYL.
