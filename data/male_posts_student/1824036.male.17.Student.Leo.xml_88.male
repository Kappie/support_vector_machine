Everything before this in the game I forgot. I think we punted...or maybe we kicked off, but anyways...Im the lone guy going down to smoke this little shrimp with the ball. I go 100 mph as hard as I can because not only do I want to tackle, I want to  punish!  I dove...(ummm like jumped...is that the word dove?...spelling maybe...) and smoked the dude...and next thing I know im being asked by the ref what day it is...I replied 'Monday' (but I was later informed by a few guys that instead of saying Monday i said Mo o nday.) I guess I was sluring my words.  Final analysis...very bad stinger...maybe a mild concussion. I dont quite know...but if I know my way home...can get onto my computer which is password locked...etc. etc. I guess I'm doing okay...Just a small memory loss...  We were behind anyways. And we tied it up.  THEN  with about 40 sec. left Preston (a.k.a. toe) picks off a pass and runs it back for a TD and we win. everyone goes nuts. But except for the pounding headache, very soar back, neck, and torso (like stomach muscles...), and the spacing off...Im fine =S
