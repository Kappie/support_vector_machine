Humm, she thought, for some reason, I don’t think this is the note.  Henrietta flew back under the pillow.  Finally, she found the rather large piece of paper folded around a small wooden box.  Well, small wouldn’t exactly be the words Henrietta would describe it.  Only being two and a half inches high, the box was about the size she was.  Sighing softly, she took out her wand and said a few words.  The box and the paper shrank to a size where she could pick them both up easily.  After prying them out of the young boy’s fingers, Henrietta read what was written on the paper:  Dear Mis Toof-farie, i lost mi first toof today.  mommy told me to put it uder mi pello.  she too said dat u wood gime a dime! THANK U, TOOF FARIE! wif luv, Billy  Awe, how sweet!  Henrietta whispered softly.  The little boy’s hair slid gently over his sleeping face.  What a cute little kid!  Being the tooth fairy and all, Henrietta often got letters similar to Billy’s.  They were no big surprise, and yet, each time, she wrote back.  Henrietta drew out her small pencil and paper.  Being careful to use words he would understand she began to write.  She wrote a brief reply and placed it under his pillow.  Next, Henrietta opened the small wooden box and swapped the tooth with a shiny dime, as promised.  Well, I guess I’m done here, she thought.  With a light kiss on the cheek, the fairy disappeared into the night.    Henrietta traveled back to her home at Pearly White Estates.  It was where all tooth fairies lived.  She flew up to her one bedroom apartment and opened the door using the star at the end of her wand as a key.  Once inside, Henrietta let out another soft sigh, took out the many wrinkled pieces of paper consisting of misspelled words and random drawings of fairies and put them in her “Letter Trunk.”  It was already getting rather full of the children’s notes, but she didn’t care.  They were what made her job bearable.  A loud knock thundered, knocking Henrietta out of her thoughts.  When she opened the door, a fairy dashed in.  Agnus, again.  “Hey, Henny! How was your night?  Mine was great! I can’t believe I’ve been a tooth fairy for almost a week! It’s so amazing! I couldn’t imagine a better job than this in the world!  One kid even wrote me a letter! TO ME! Can you believe it?! Oh, also, Victor is mad at you.  He was rambling something about you not bringing in the teeth right away.  You may want to go and talk to him.  Henny?”  “Yes, Angus.  I’ll go talk to Victor.  I’m glad you’ve had a good week.”  Henrietta sighed.  Poor Angus.  He didn’t understand how boring the rest of his life was going to be: going out every night, gathering teeth, and coming home again.  At least the Cavity Council was considering changing the job rotations to every other day, due to the immediate interest in Tooth Fairying jobs.  “Okay Henny. Guess what?! I’ve thought up a new name for us Tooth Fairys!  Take a guess!”  Angus spoke so fast that it was hard for even Henrietta to understand him some of the time.    “I don’t know Angus.  Why don’t you tell me?”  “THE MOLARINATOR!”  he cried excitedly.   “Yeah, Angus.  You should really bring that up to Victor next time you see him.  I’m sure he’d love it!”  Henrietta laughed to herself.  Victor, the Vice President fairy of the Cavity Council had no sense of humor at all.  He also had no respect for new innovations that the Council proposed.    “Wow, you really think so?”  Angus asked, a look of confusing spread across his face.  Before Henrietta could reply that she was joking, a bell rang throughout the Estate.  “What’s that?”  Angus whispered.  “I don’t know.  We had better go find out.”  Henrietta answered worriedly.  They don’t usually sound the bell unless something dreadfully bad has happened, she thought.  The two fairies flew down to the square where everyone was gathered, all confused.  Victor wavered above them, speaking in a loud voice.  “Quiet everyone.  What has happened here today has taken us by complete and total astonishment.  Never before has any fairy had the nerve to contradict the Council’s power.  I will promise you all, that he will be punished in the strictest matter possible.”  “What happened, Victor?”  a voice spoke up.  “Well, to be completely honest, I don’t know what the motivation of the crime was, nor do I know how long it has been going on. I ---”  “Geez, man! Just tell us!”  A fairy yelled, with many others around him nodding in agreement.  “Okay okay!  Everyone here is aware of Marcus, right?”  Victor asked the people.  Marcus was a fairy that every other fairy knows.  You couldn’t miss him.  He was always getting into trouble somewhere, somehow.  “He has been caught selling teeth on the Plaque Market.”  Victor told the group.  Dead silence.  So many questions were running through Henrietta’s mind, and yet the most important one was what where they going to do?  “The D.L.E. will be sent out to capture Marcus and his team before they can sell anymore teeth.  We will need everyone’s help.  Half of you will work double shifts to ensure that the world of children will not know of our crisis.  The other half will be split into groups to help resolve this.  I need two volunteers to go with the D.L.E.  Anyone?”  Victor waited as the group soaked in the information.  Angus raised his hand high.  He was willing to go with the D.L.E ((Dental Law Enforcement)).    Henrietta thought for a few seconds.  If Angus can do it, so can I! Anyway, he’ll need me along.   She raised her hand.  Victor said a few more words and then motioned Henrietta and Angus to follow him into Colgate Hall.  After the group was settled in to a conference room, and many more people joined them, the meeting started.  “Now, you two are going to be joining a group of the elite D.L.E. forces.  You will be led by Agent Kristo.  He will give you a briefing in private with the other D.L.E.’s.  Good Luck!”  Victor along with the other fairies left the room.  Dressed in a black tuxedo, Agent Kristo stepped into the room as the last fairy left.  He gave a small nod to Angus and Henrietta, and then sat down at the end of the long table.  Several other fairies, all dressed in black, filed into the room and sat at the table as if they knew exactly what they were doing.  When everyone was seated, Kristo made a small cough, and spoke.  “Well, we are all here.  Let us begin.”  And so it began.  The most perilous and daring adventure two simple Tooth Fairies undertook.  Well, Henrietta thought, maybe being a Tooth Fairy wasn’t such a bad idea after all.
