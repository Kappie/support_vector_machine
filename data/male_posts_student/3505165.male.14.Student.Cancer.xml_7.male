It was many different sound clips of him, making speeches, making announcements and whatnot.  And all through the whole saddening, tear-bringing thing, the only thing I could think about was about how long they must of had this ready for when he finally kicked the bucket.  Now, does being so, well, I don't really know......I guess.......cynical, make me a bad person. Maybe being so cynical is just my way of overcoming the sadness that I should be feeling since of of our most famous presidents has just died. Or maybe the sadness just doesn't affect me because I wasn't alive while he was president.  I remember seeing footage of JFK's assassination, and remember thinking how sad it must of been to be alive for that. That's one of those events where you will always remember what was happening that day when you found out.  Like, I can't really remember what happened for the first part of the day, but I can recall like it was yesterday what happened on 9/11 when we found out about the terrorist attacks. There were rumors going through the school that something had happened in New York, because I guess that some teachers had let it slip, or had shown their students what was happening on TV. But at the very end of the day in homeroom, I remember they made a short, puzzling announcement to the effect of:  "Earlier today some planes crashed into buildings in New York and Washington D.C."  And that was pretty much it. They gave us no information, absolutely nothing besides the facts that some planes had crashed. That pretty much left us to make our own ideas. I can remember Jimmy Fahey saying on the bus that it was probably some terrorists who hated the U.S., and I was saying that he was wrong and that it would turn out to be some crazy Americans who didn't like the government or something.  I don't really think that any of us understood the full extent of what had happened that day until we got home and just sat there, in front of the TV, for hours, just watching the news coverage.  They kept showing the planes crashing into the towers again and again, non-stop, just imprinting it into your brain.  The next day in Writing class, I remember that Ms. Connell made us write in our journals our reactions to what had happened the day before. All I was able to write was pretty much the fact that 2 planes had crashed into the World Trade Towers, one into the Pentagon, and one that might of been on it's way to the White House or Camp David. But I distinctly rememeber that Harry Edwards wrote a poem about it. I can't remember how any of it went except for the very last two lines. But those lines will probably stick with me for the rest of my life. It went:    Yesterday there was no fun, Yesterday was 9-1-1     I don't know why it was that that snagged in my brain, but it was, and that it was I will always remember.
