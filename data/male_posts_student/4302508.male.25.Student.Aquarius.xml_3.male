I just saw them tonight opening for Fear Factory along with two hardcore bands not worth mentioning.  They were the definite highlight of the show.  I'm not a huge Fear Factory fan but even so, they were very boring.  With Mastodon's performance though I'm now a hooked fan.  I'm not even really sure how to describe what Mastodon does musically.  Somewhere edging on grindcore but more melodic with incredible drumming.  Go listen to them!  I've been told that the upcoming album  Leviathan  is based on the classic book  Moby Dick .
