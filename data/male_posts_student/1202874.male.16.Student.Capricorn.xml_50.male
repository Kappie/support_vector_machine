Charles Dickens doesn't have anything on this kid*  saturday mornings after eating a well balanced breakfast of salsa and chips it seems to make me feel philosophical about life. i feel like putting my perspective about things happening recently on my blog. warning to all those who are pregnant, have trouble reading more than is on the menu at burger king, or are just are plain illiterate i have a feeling this is gonna be one of the longer post. that just eliminated about 80% of the bhs population. but now that we got rid of all the rift-raft we'll proceed with the demonstration. i'm gonna let my mind kinda wonder here but i'll keep an electric collar on it just in case it makes a break towards the cliff.  i'll start with yesterday because had a bunch of climaxes (high and low) that just gave perfect examples of all that has been bothering me and all that has been good lately. school was just another day but after i walked with liz to her house before practice. it was pretty funny the whole way there. we were being stupid and laughing hysterically like everytime we're together. i really miss that girl and all the fun times we've had. after that matt hryb picked me up and we went to practice. we worked out and had about a hour and a half of swimming. basically normal stuff. then we played water basketball in the deep end. everyone on that team hates someone else on the team. a couple people were getting mad cause some of the wannabe hard-core black kids were getting a little rough. girls were mad at each other cause of the same reasons. just a lotta built up tension was being let out. then there was about 20 minutes of hissy fit arguing in the showers about the score. i got pissed from then on cause these people aren't gonna care this much when we lose a meet. then coach wouldn't give me an answer on what all of us "snow bunnies" (best word that came to mind, sorry people) should do about snowboarding since a lot of our meets are on the same days as ski club goes. i got real heated about those last two things. its been a week into practice and i'm already sick of most of these people. but finally after all that drama i made it over to amber's. that's what kept the gun out of my mouth last night. we watched some tv and made hot cocoa. we were suppose to have popcorn but amber struggled to keep from burning them. it was funny though. that girl really does make me happy and completely forget about unpleasant days. it was good time spent with amber even though mrs. godlewski (her mom) makes me the slightest bit uncomfortable in some conversations. on the otherhand mitch was extremely depressed all night. the kid is usually in a joking mood and funny. he just wasn't having it last night. i suppose its because he used to be so close to christine and me but those two had a major falling out and naturally i have been with amber more. he cut off his mohawk, too. for his sake i hope he finds someone that makes him happy and pronto.   so that kinda turned into a normal (but longer) blog about friday night with my explainations for why everything happened. hold the phone though, there's still some stuff that needs to be put down in this log. i need this stuff to be put down so i can see it visualy. they say people are more like to accomplish things/goals if they write them down. let's see if those genius's are right... i know this one is long but just butch up nancy. (inside joke)  -a fork in the road really seems to be presenting it self to my attention. if there is one thing i enjoy more than anything, it would be snowboarding. ever since 7th grade its been something i really loved doing, no matter how mediocre my ability is. last year was a lot of fun and there really hasn't been any times out there where i haven't laughed continuously with my friends. also i alluded earlier about the conflict of the swim team schedule preventing me from going with ski club this year. as much as used to love swim team and the competition, this year has not been even nearly as enjoyable. everybody seems to have there opinion on what i should do yet ironically i have no clear idea on what i feel. this weekend will see a lot of serious thinking about the subject.   -the people that i spend time with regularly has changed so much in the past couple weeks. even though i absolutely love the people i'm with now, i really miss those other people. tom is a really good friend but its been ages since we've just hung out. yesterdays walk with liz really brought up fond memories. but then there's some things i really am happy have changed and don't regret for one second. marcus used to be my best guy friend but it never seemed like he was going to grow up. it never seemed to be his fault when we were pissed at each other. that kid was really funny and i liked being around him in good times. but when things weren't go so good, watch out. the hardest friend i ever tried to keep. another thing that changed for the better is i stopped trying to fit in with the whole jack-armond crowd. those kids just don't have any depth to them. even when tom tries to, they've stood him up plenty of times. it wasn't my thing, i guess.   -so much is going to change for me before i graduate high school. even before i finish this year. it's kinda scary when you realize something like that. 3 years from now i'll be at some college trying to survive freshman year. 2 years from now i'll be a senior and my friends like liz, mitch, etc will be away at their college. just next year i'll driving which is good. but amber will be gone. actually she'll be going to a school for chiropractors but probably have her own house around bedford. that'd be awesome. but then like there's always the chance that something will happen and we won't be still friends or anything. the possibilities (good and bad) are endless. jeez it's crazy.   well i'm pooped out from all this thinking and you should be a marathon runner if you read all of this insane stuff. i can smell my mom's brownies so i'll keep you posted as more situations develop.
