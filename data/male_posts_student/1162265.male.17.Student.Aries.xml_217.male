Like today, during 9th period we were going to the Pizza shop, and Zack was smoking cloves.  So he says "Hey, you want one?" and I'm thinking "Well... I have a swim meet today...."  but nooooo....  So I say, "I'll just take a hit."  Now, this is one of the only smart things I learned in Health class about smoking.  Your not supposed to gulp smoke, this isn't a drug that's supposed to mess you up.  So I just took the smoke into my mouth, let it sit for a second and blew out.  It honestly wasn't much of anything, and it has a dull aftertaste which is similar to how it smells (cloves do smell better then cigs).  I do have to admit it was fun blowing the smoke out, and Zack spent most of his time messing around with blowing the smoke out.  So, lesson?  Don't smoke.  I've essentially proven that to myself completely.  It has absolutely not advantages to it.  I was hearing some people talk about smoking later, and they said the craving never goes away either.  So, me, I'm like "Glad I don't smoke." haha.  Yeah.  So take my advice, and if you get too curious don't bring the smoke into your lungs, just keep it in your mouth.    Thomas says I experiment with drugs to much.  Not true, haha.
