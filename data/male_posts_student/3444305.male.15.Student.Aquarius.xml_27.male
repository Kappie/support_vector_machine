CJ and Mercer, I believe it was them or it could be someone else but its probably them, posted over 400 comments in less than one hour. To prove to everyone they have no life, probably. But those 400 comments, and me trying to remove them all at once, got it suspended. But I emailed them, and hopefully they unsuspend it soon, but like I said, if you're reading this, it's already unsuspended. Well yesterday, I drove myself out of bed, it was hard let me tell you. Getting up sucks, really really bad. And then going to school in the summer is just depressing, but at least i'll get it out of the way. It's better to take it for one month, then to take it a whole semester. Well hopefully it is. And plus, me taking summer school means I don't have to have 0 hour my second semester. So that is always a plus. Well after summer school I came home and then just waited and then at lunch time me and my family went to Pizza Hut which was good. Pizza is good. I like pizza. Exspecially lots of it. After that, I came home and I was so tired. SO I took a three hour nap. It was nice, but I got up, and had a crap load of homework to do, so I did my two hours of APS, and then off to band I went. No one was really there, me and Haley were talking about ditching it lol. But we stayed, with the Mr. Karth as dirtector. Yuck! I do not like that man. But I got through it, we actually have some cool songs for this years show. I just hope the drill is cool. But then after that, I came home and got online and talked for a little. And then I went outside and played basketball. I then just talked online and waited for my account to get unsuspended. Well, that's really all I have to say. Later.
