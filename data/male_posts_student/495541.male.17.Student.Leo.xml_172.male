It kind of sucks though that I missed so much for the wedding but I'm not going to say anything more about it.  I could have worked harder.  I guess lesson learned and I move on.  Well today was an alright day.  Nothing really big.  During 2nd hour though outside went completely dark which was weird.  It later lightened up but everything seems weird inside when it gets dark outside.  Normally you expect it to be light outside and then you get some natural light but when it went dark outside, it was just weird.  I don't know.  But anyways in Intro Comp Prog today we had some assignments to do.  I actually got two done and theres only 5 and Beall said there should be about 1 a day... So dang I'm ahead of schedule but at the same time not because I haven't made up my test yet.  Boo.  But at least I understand some of the While and If commands.  Thanks to Andrew who sits next to me.  Yeah, I'm not a computer genius like everyone thinks.  It's about time I break out of that stereotype.  Thanks.  But I should be getting to bed.  I'm tired now.  I hope tomorrow is better than today was.. But not to say today was bad.  I just want tomorrow to be better I guess.  Night.
