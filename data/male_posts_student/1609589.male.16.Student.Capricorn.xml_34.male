I think that's why i had it closed in the first place.  I went outside to help my mom bring in the groceries, and i was hit by a huge gust of hot air. It was like a politician or some kind of religious figure just walked into my house.  Well, the Galaxies beta is over. Me, being the idiot that I am, accidentally got rid of the game, htinking the beta was already over, but it wasn't. Luckily, jason took some screenshots for me, so i was able to see the memorial. I'm gonna prolly get it again after this weekend, when i have some money. I'm wasting all the 15 bucks i have now to goto TGC tonight, so i can get out of the house(and play video games at a DIFFERENT place! haha).  Oh well. That's it for now. I'm gonna go watch tv with my "TGC tonite! Anyone wanna come? Call me!" away message up. So, Anyone wanna come to TGC tonite? Read my away message!
