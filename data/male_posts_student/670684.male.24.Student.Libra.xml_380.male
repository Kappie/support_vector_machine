I love the idea of owning a niche of society, and what better than a site devoted to pedestrian bridges?  A site devoted to ranking the best shitters at UT.  Enough said.    I will build a pedestrian bridge site as soon as my thesis is done.  Until then, today is the UT Law School!       I've spent many a night playing EverQuest at the Law School, as the couches are quite comfy and I didn't bother to own internet at the apartment last year.  Anyway, I always assumed that the structure was a patio for grabass and rich kids to drink coffee the wrong way and bitch about their starched shirts.         Oh was I wrong!
