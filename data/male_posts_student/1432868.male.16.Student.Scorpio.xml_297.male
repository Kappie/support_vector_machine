I never want to hear my voice recorded again after that test therefore I don't think I'm gonna be recording too many more.   One of the things I've found most interesting since I decided to announce my gmail invites on my site is that everybody who knows about them wants one. It really is the best marketting I've seen in years. Think about it, they limiting of the inital beta did nothing other then to build curiosity. The invites allow to basicly make beta testers the advertisements for their service. It is really quite amazing. Everyone who can't get one wants one. Of course it helps that almost all of the feedback for gmail has been positive.   The interface is one of the best web UI's I have seen in a while. Very little eye-candy, but very snappy. The organization is much like a online forum. It has your mail, then reply, then your reply, and so on and so forth. Spam blocking is pretty good, although I haven't tested it completely yet. Of course all the extra space is nice too. ^_^   So anyway when I get back on monday I'll start giving out Gmail accounts again...maybe even to some of the random commenters I've gotten stuff from.
