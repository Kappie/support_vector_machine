I'm tired of having to rely on other people for my own happiness. I'm tired of feeling the need for somebody to be by my side. It's not that I want to be alone, it's that I want to feel self-sufficient in my happiness.  Was I ever happy as a kid? I honestly can't remember. I remember hating my father from pretty much as early as I can remember, and I can remember having screaming fits about being lonely and not having any friends to play with when I was six or seven, but I honestly can't remember one moment of being truly happy. Maybe when I caught those yabbies in the pools of water that were left after a particularly heavy downpour when I was living in Casino, NSW. Or maybe when I got my very first videogame system, a Sega Master System II, and played Alex Kidd in Miracle World nonstop for six weeks.  I remember the first moment of pure emotional hurt though. The first girl I ever really truly liked (I was like, 12 1/2 or so) got wind of how I felt about her, and told me in no uncertain terms that under no circumstances would she ever go out with me. Not even if I were the last man on earth.  I was shattered.  In the grand scheme of things though, that was only a minor event, so why does it still haunt me to this day? Since then, the only girls that have wanted to go out with me have had major issues which have prevented getting together. I can count the number of those women on one hand, too.  I tell myself that I should feel lucky that women even want to be freinds with me, let alone 'something more' but then, being 'just friends' with somebody you want to be with with every fibre of your being is incredibly painful, and sometimes you wonder if it's really worth all the trouble.  So what do I do? Do I pin my heart to my sleeve and hope that somebody doesn't suddenly decide my shirt needs an ironing? Or should I just suppress it all and hope that I'll just bump into Somebody Special one day and it'll just Happen?  Is there a third option that I'm missing here? I've tried both of the other ones, and they seem to be just different paths to the same pain.  It's 3:25am, and this is the reason why I can never go to sleep before midnight unless I'm utterly exhausted.   The snake behind me hisses what my damage could have been. My blood before me begs me to open up my heart again. And I feel this coming over like a storm again. -MJ Keenan
