I watched Death to Smoochy tonight and nearly started crying during the ice show at the end. Gah. Damn you Norton and your expressive eyes.  Incidently, DtS could potentially be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time. Danny DeVito is an incredibly talented director with a knack for framing scenes in a way that makes you feel just slightly off balance. There were so many funny people involved in this movie, it's no suprise it ended up being the masterpiece that it is. The bloopers on the DVD were a riot.  The auto show today was quite good. I bought a "Chammy" - a microfibre artificial chamois. It has to be one of the most remarkable sales pitches I've ever seen - the pitch only sells because this thing is probably one of the most remarkable fucking substances on the face of the planet. This chap literally poured out a quarter of a bottle of coke into a scap of carpet, soaked it through and sucked the whole mess up just by pressing down on the whole lot for no more than 10 seconds with this orange wunderkloth. He soaked the counter several times with a sponge, mopping the mess up everytime without leaving a drop and tossing the cloth up in the air. Not a drop spilled on the crowd. Then he squeezed it all out into a dish, then soaked everything up in the dish just by dropping the cloth in. Fucking phenomenal.  I bought an air freshener too. I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
