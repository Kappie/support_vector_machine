Then, I stupidly went an hour early assuming that someone would be there (Mr. D, Mr. Tassone, Ms. Hemenway, janitor, George W. Bush...). No one. I sat around for 45 minutes after talking to Mr. Foley (he didn't need any help...) and Ms. Packer (I don't think she did either!).  The concert went really well when everyone showed up. I had a great time playing with the "Jizz" band and Symph. band. Orchestra was iffy though. LOTR is becoming stale.  I found a funny story  urlLink here...  Okay! You know the line! Less sooner!
