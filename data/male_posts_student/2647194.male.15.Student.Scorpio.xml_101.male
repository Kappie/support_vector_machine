I'm researching for the negative side of a National Missile Defense system. I promise, I won't go on a huge fucking rant about how much I hate Bush and his shitty ideas (this one was actually Reagan's), but National Missile Defense is bogus.  Rec hour: Instead of participating in the trivial pursuit tourney, I expected to be in a softball game. However, since I like really freakin hard challenges, I played a game of ultimate (frisbee). 5 on about 10 or 12, with me being on the team of 5 with Grant, Cailin, Connor, and Marco. We were obviously superior ultimate players, because even with having to cover 3 people at once, our team of 5 won, 12-11. One hell of a close game, but the other team had the lead only once. The rest of the time we were up by 1, or even 2, or tied. Playing hard ultimate in a black t-shirt on a hot day=physical drainage.  After MITY: Instead of getting a ride from my mom, I decided to stay (I had my Orbea on campus with me, which kicked ass because I could get around much better). So of course, me, Grant, Cailin, Stephanie, Marco, Connor, and a few other people tossed around the disc. Oh, and I have a habit of slipping in the only mud spot on the whole field. As for ultimate: there's a reason why I'm called "the cherrypicker". It's great having a huge vertical. playing more ultimate=more physical drainage  Also, I did ride my Orbea home from Macalester. With one hell of a heavy backpack. It took about 1 hour and 10 minutes, plus I ran out of water, and plus the backpack kept slightly cutting off circulation in my arms...damn thing. biking home with a heavy backpack from St. Paul after playing lots of ultimate=hellish physical drainage. Plus my back hurts.  I guess I should get more sleep tonight...
