It felt like needles poking me all over my body, but it didn't hurt, it felt good, and I was overcome with joy: almost to the point of crying. All my thoughts and concerns disappeared: I was floating in happiness. I felt like I could fly on a gust of wind. All of a sudden I could think clearly about deep things, unrestrained by any physical cares. It was totally like what enlightenment must feel like. I realized how petty and crude many people are. I was...happy. Truly happy for the first time in a while.  wow...  that felt really good.  I really have no more stress. I need to spend more time thinking about the present than worrying about the future. That is the key to true happiness: live in the moment. But be sparing; in this life if you never look ahead, you will hit a proverbial brick wall. A paradox. Hmm...meditation is good.   Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string.   keep rockin' Emerson my man...  I don't care what anybody says, Vertical Horizon rocks the planet to the core and no one can truthfully say otherwise.
