So I followed Divyesh there as his mom was sending him..and went to Afandi`s uncle`s office along Jln Maarof..met Idzmil and Jamal there who were there to record the advertisement as well..and Imran..Fendi`a cute 7 or 8 year old cousin was there.               So basically what we had to do was to say YES and YA!Its like backround voices for the ad so you cant quite tell our voices :p.so we were like 1-2-3 yes!..the 1st three were like loud but not as loud as the last one!and the same for 'YA!'.Haha.They had the girl voice version of it.They just needed the guys version and they new who to look for :D.Anyway we didn`t get paid but got fresh hot pizza from Pizza Hut to make up for it :D.  anyway it was damn fun..Afandi wa showing us his cheap card tricks and his cheap coin tricks which he claim were 'magic'.haha.Damn cheap man.  So like the 1-2-3 part we took turns saying..each time wit idzmil or Jamal we got it wrong..so under my leadership..we got it all perfect wei!Cehlamak!They called it 'American Leadership'.Haha.Damn funny la...afandi`s uncle came in the recording room when Idzmil and Jamal were pretending to be pro singers.Heh.Oh yeah Afandi`s tricks or so called skills with Imran`s magnetic toys were damn funnyily fake.And when saying YA...Afandi said.."I thought Divyesh said yuck".What and idiot!  Anyway it took 5 minutes in all to it all..Fendi`s uncle kept the whole thing running so when we heard the playback damn funny cause it recorded all our rants in the middle of the recording.Lol.  So like one day were planning to record our own album man...then distribute all over school..cehlamak!Famous then man..so then Afandi sent all us back and me 1st..  Ok please forgive me for such imcomplete details and a weird blogging style thats simliar to my old style..just that I aint got much of a mood to blog..sorry!  Riz.Now thats still there!
