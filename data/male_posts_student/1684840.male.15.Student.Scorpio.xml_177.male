Craig frog hopped over James and aparantly kicked him in the head.  Craig apologised and then James went round saying he was "Going to kill Craig".  I'm sorry but STOP ACTING SO HARD!!  Frankly he has pissed us all off a bit.  I don't know how this is going to turn out, but yet another pathetic issue revolving around Brannan is about the last one I can cope with    Chris got kegged in games lol!  That's about the 4th time this week that has happened to Chris now.  Chris must be pretty sick and embarrassed to hell by it now!  Biology was bloody hilarious!  We were supposed to be doing something about plants but the diagrams Miss. Hussain drew on the board even got Miss. Jairi laughing!  What were supposed to resemble shoots on a plant looked rather like the male anatomy.  Then to top it all off, Miss. Jairi went and drew a scale beside the shoot "2cm"; Oh the laughter!  After school was kool, the gang went down town with Josh this time and walked about a bit.  Craig got soaked in the pool and then went and sat on Chris lmao.  We had a walk around town for a bit and we saw Miss. Lyons in town.  We then went back to town park and Chris took a trolley.  We saw this croup of baby swans with the parents and they weren't very happy when we got up close; they hissed!  But they looked so cute...    A mad man who walked over the bridge started singing to them it was hilarious!!  Sam caught some footage of him as well, that should be appearing on the forum soon lmao.  We walked around and sat down near the pool, where loads of the tiny rogues were sitting with the big manly bitch who was being nasty to Michaela the other day.  They started again, this time on Oliver so we made our way back through town and back home.  The day was quite cool actually!  Peace out...
