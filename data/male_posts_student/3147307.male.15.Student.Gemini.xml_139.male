And then I went to Driver's Ed. boring like usual. and then at 4ish, I rode my bike for an hour and 45 minutes. Went up through Meridian Woods and then down to CGHS. and made a few loops and came back. And then took a ten minute break and ran to church for fun night. My legs went out though about half-way there and on Southport Rd., I developed two terrible cramps in my quads. Wasn't pretty. But I'm supposed to run two-a-days until school starts, so it was necessary.
