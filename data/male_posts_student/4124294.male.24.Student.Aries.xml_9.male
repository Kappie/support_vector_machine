In fact, had a grand total of MINUS AUS$50 in the bank account. And then they slap me with a penalty for overwithdrawal, a whopping $45. I banked in $100 and ended up with $5 in the bank. I love my life. Grr. Arrgh.  Anyway, I'm gonna talk a bit more on some of the productions I've been in here at uni. I'll leave the children's shows for later, but right now I wanna touch on the show that was staged in November 2003. It's a famous enough show: Shakespeare's  Richard III.  I was asked to write some songs for it, and I thought,  Hmm, okay. Shouldn't be too difficult.  And then the director tells me, "It's  Richard III,  done as a musical, set in an Indian nightclub. Meaning I'm looking for Bollywood."  Bollywood. Oh gawsh. Now, I enjoy a good Bollywood movie as much as the next average Malaysian, but to be composing songs that  sound  like they come from a Bollywood film...  that  was tricky. Especially since I'm not Indian, and I didn't have many friends familiar with the music here in Perth. Not to mention the fact that any access to Bollywood albums and movies was severely limited by my location. What made it harder was the fact that the director wanted to use existing songs such as  Thunderstruck  by AC/DC and  Going to the Chapel,  that oldie by...I-don't-know-who, and then  rearrange  these songs so that they  sound Indian.  Suffice it to say, I balked. I told him it would be a lot easier for me to write  original  music that  intentionally  sound Bollywoodesque, rather than try to alter  unoriginal  songs into Hindi-film music. The director was sceptical, but in the end, he agreed.  Did I succeed? I don't know. I wrote songs, threw in the occasional sitar sound effect from my Technics SX-KN2400 keyboard, mucked about with percussion, included strains of Indian-style scales and note progressions that honestly sounded more Middle Eastern than Bollywood, and basically managed to  deceive  the director into believing it sounded Bollywood. In comparison, I think my songs sounded  nothing  like Bollywood - but nobody in the cast and crew of  Richard III  was really knowledgable on the authenticities of the genre anyway, and so they believed I was successful. And I let them believe it. Why not.  The show went well (despite backstage politics, a story for another time); the set and design was megaflashy and megacolourful, and the music was well-appreciated, thank God. Sadly we didn't get to do a recording of the show, although I  do  have demo files of some of the songs in my computer. Now if there was a way for me to upload these files as Mp3s or something, I'd do it. I'm sure there is. But that's a skill to be learnt some other time, so in the meanwhile, any of you who are intrigued by the faux Bollywood material I've come up with must wait just a little while longer.  Still, here are some photos. Ahh, the good old days. Those of you with low downloading... um... bandwidth...thingy.... I apologise. :)      Above: Some of the cast practising choreography during the workshops and rehearsals.        Above: The opening scene of the show, during which the Bollywood-style music abruptly segues into a hip-hop rap number. Don't ask.                More scenes from the show.        A cheesy promotional shot of me, in costume. Erk.   And below: the poster for the show.               All photos (C)2003 by S. Tampalini    For those who are interested, here's a  urlLink link  to a review of the show. Ignore the rest of the posts in that forum, they're largely irrelevent to the review.  Okay, that's it for now! ___________________   PS: Hello to Sarah, who visited this blog recently!! :)
