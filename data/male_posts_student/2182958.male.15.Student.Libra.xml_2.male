It was at South High School. a bunch of people were there...a bunch of fucking losers. except for chris and brian and tiana of course.  It was so different. Their two new members played really well and were very good...but they just did things...differently.  Like White Limousine. During that song i was expecting one of those crazy solos....but instead i got this....weird complicated solo that doesnt match. and the songs just didnt feel the same. the two new band members really can achieve the sound if they practice...but they dont really have that look. they dont really look like theyre in the strawberries. it saddened me. so i left.  Other bands that also played were The Sultan of Sound, The Falcon, and the Mopps.  The Mopps played last but i didnt stay for them.  The Falcon on the other hand was amazing. As usual.
