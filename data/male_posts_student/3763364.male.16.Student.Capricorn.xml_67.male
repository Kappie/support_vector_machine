I've wished for this, I've bitched at that, I've left behind this little fact: You cannot kill what you did not create. I've gotta say what I've gotta say, And then I swear I'll go away, But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise. I guess I’ll save the best for last, My future seems like one big past, You’re left with me 'cause you left me no choice.
