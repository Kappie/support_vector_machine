This is my congratulations post for Ms. Elise Englebreteeteeterereson (it's German or something, but I don't reallysprechen the Deutsch, so I don't know how to spell-en the Deutsch either). Actually, it's not even German, I just forget the origin of the name. THIS IS ALL beside the point. The point is, I hear through the grapevine you got a job Elise. CONGRATS! Send me a business card, we'll do lunch.   Good job!
