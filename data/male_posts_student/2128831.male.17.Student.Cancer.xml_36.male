My live, my place and everything about me in Virginia is gone, completely!  My ex Michael has a new love and he is an almost ex of mine, I kills me to help Eric out with Michael, I don’t want them to love, but I have to let go, but in isn’t like in Thailand when you release birds in the marketplace, they return to their cages but I know that Michael will not be coming back to me.  My heart is filled with such sorrow, like Virginia didn’t wish to have me anyways, but I want it.  School is moving on, and all is forgotten, my family moves on, all does but I am standing still, caught in the driving snow.  As the snow piles up, so shall my depression, and the rosy sunrise that breaks over the trees bears no effect on me, and the grace of a new day shan’t either.  I need a savior and I need him now, but I shall have to do this alone for fate shall show that this is only the end in Virginia.  That sun has set, and in Winsconsin it is rising but I simply need to forget and live anew, and if I don’t my worldliness shall slip away...
