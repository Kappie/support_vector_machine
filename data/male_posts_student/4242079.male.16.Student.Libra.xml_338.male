He seems to be moving a little quicker now, and I think that was part of the reason why we wasn't walking unless he absolutely had to.  I got my income tax refund from the government, went to the bank and cashed it, then gave all of it to my parents. While I was at the bank, she said there was a note on my account to offer me a Visa card. So I filled out the application. Hopefully it goes through, so I can finally start selling things on e-bay (instead of just spend, spend, spend).  I watched the movie Big Fish last night, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think I am going to watch it again tonight, since my mom's aunt from Canmore is going to be here, and she has an appreciation for fine films.  And that, my friends, is my update.
