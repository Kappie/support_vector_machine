Rituals, ceremonies, cultures, technology changed, but that special bond that a child has with it's mother remains unaltered.  What makes this bond so strong? so special?.  It cant be because the mother loves the child more than the father does, as love for the child is unconditional from both sides. The more logical reason would be the impact that the mother has on the first 9months of the child's unborn life. The child is a PART of the mother, they are one and the same. The needing relationship of the child/mother begins as soon as it is conceived and never stops, even after the umbilical cord is cut. This 9months forms a permanent bond between the child and mother. Quite honestly, I am jealous. Women often complain about the inconveniences of pregnancy and child birth.... and it's quite understandable. But I wouldn't mind going through with it, if it meant that I would know my child better than anyone in the world.  It might be taken as a cliche when your mother says "I know you 9months more than you know yourself", but .. IT'S TRUE.  More Later.....
