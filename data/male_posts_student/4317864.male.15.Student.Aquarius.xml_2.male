However, I do need to set ground rules for my blogging format, so I might as well set them here.       One post per day. At the end of the day, summarizing what happened during the day.     Progressively wittier and more intelligent writing. This might as well have more than one use, right?     A clear view of what I promised I would do and didn't do, so that I can plan and focus more effectively.
