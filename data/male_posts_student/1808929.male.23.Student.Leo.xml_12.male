I'm not going to say too much tonight just 'cause I don't really have much to talk about.  ["Don't Go Away," Oasis, 1997] Today was the proposition 12 day here in Texas. I talked about it a few weeks ago; it's a tort reform constitutional amendment that is supposed to help control skyrocketing malpractice insurance costs. We should know soon whether the amendment has passed and concurrently how many decades it'll take me to pay off my debts! Ah, no worries though, I'm not in it for the money, but I would like to actually start a family before I'm 40, so that's why I'm concerned. ["Juarez," Tori Amos, 1999] Aight y'all, take care. Let me know how you're doing if you haven't in a while.  Recommended song: "Traveling Alone," The Tony Rich Project, 2003.
