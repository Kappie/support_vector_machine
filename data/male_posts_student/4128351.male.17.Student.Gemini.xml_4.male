So, I'm all on antibiotics and such.      The hour I waited in the doctor room without a shirt on was the funnest, though. Me and Mom fought the  entire  time. They could probably hear us in the waiting room. It was great, I won.       We went and ordered my gay senior pictures and then went to Taco Bell. Then, we went home.      I put all my posters up in my room, it looks alright. Then, we ate dinner.       Dustin and Troy came out for a little bit, we didn't do anything really.      Then, I got a shower, and went to Point after fighting with the parents again.      I got home around 11:40 and fell asleep before this morning came.       I woke up around 2:30 PM and now I feel like crap. I'm cold, I'm hungry (but there's no food), and I'm not sure if I'm allowed driving or not. I don't give a damn anymore, I'm just going to leave I think. I'm sick of being alone and sick of being stuck out in the goddamn country.       I'm not really angry, I threw those in for flare.       I'm going to go get a shower and then pick Brice, Kerry (not the next President), Keith (who's staying with us for four days), and Pimp (who loves suntan lotion) up. Brice wants to go to WalMart and then somewhere to eat. In the last two full days, I've only eaten twice. I hate money.      Well, I'm out of here. Bye.       P.S. Where the hell is Jamin? He must be camping with Erin, I hope he's alright. I miss that little douchebag.
