I make mathematical programs.  Basically, they're different from regular programs, but who cares.  I used to program TIs. They were way too slow. Now I just use Javascript. The codes are alike, and it's a lot faster.  Since I like the number pi a lot, that's my first number to experiment with on the coordinate plane here.  I made a program called  urlLink Pi Finder!  that uses an RNG to find pi.  Kinda cool?
