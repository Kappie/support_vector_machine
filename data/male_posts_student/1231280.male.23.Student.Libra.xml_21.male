Thought hard yesterday about my life and the things i need to fix within it. One of them is Jessica. I need to get her back. However, this is easier said than done. I spent 200 dollars on her (diamonds- I might add) for Christmas! I don't do that for anyone, and yet, her and I just threw it all away like fucking 2 year olds. We are both going through some shit right now, and I'm sure each of us could use each others company during these tough times. Shit, I know I sure could. Who knows? She's a very strong minded person and probably has moved on. I was so passive when I was around her. I wasn't as strong headed or stubborn as I am normally. Oh well. I fucked it up, like I have done with so many other things in my life. It is... my life. It is... my curse.  -B
