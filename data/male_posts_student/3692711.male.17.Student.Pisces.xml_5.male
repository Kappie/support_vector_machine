It's like wondering what they look like and are they friendly that kind of stuff.  Hehe, nevertheless, we have a stretching session in the morning conducted by Miss Lim. haha! Expected!! Cos' she's a PE teacher afterall!!! Well, we still have fun while doing our stretching.  Then, after our breakfast, we have our morning walk, in the resort and around our area, accompanied by Miss Lim while Mr Goh and Mr Ng has to meet up with the Sepilok's coordinator to discuss our programmes. Hmmm, we do have fun during the walk, we sing songs and cheers, chat around, look at our surroundings etc. [The song and cheers really reminds me of my NPCC daes~~ sob sob~~] "Haha, one of the shots of our resort. Damn beautiful bahz?" urlLink     urlLink    "This is part of the route to RIC or FRC, imagine, we have to walk this road everydae.." urlLink     urlLink     Next, we stopped by a small river/lake (or a big pond??) with a nice pavalion (which is next to the Rainforest Interpretation Center (RIC)). However, that place is full of mosquitoes and big red ants!! But we  chap siao  (heck care) and form a circle and started to play "Murderer".... I am appointed as a detective once BUT I am a lousy one!! Everyone was almost killed and I have not identify the murderer! *Sigh* nevertheless, it is very enjoyable and is a good chance to interact with each and every one of us.  The next thing is the meeting up with the Sepilok youths. On our way, I noticed that Mr Ng is sort of getting impatient of us for being walking so slow to the RIC. Most of us, who are at the front, keep asking those at the back to double up, but thet are like... *sigh*   I feel rather impatient and a little angry actually  . They are like strolling, OMG! Really treat this as a holidae trip...though i dont mind having a holidae trip =p  Okae, @ the RIC, we meet and played some games... like "Getting to know you" (Nah, it's really lame one). All of us are given a tag and is clipped on our shirt at the back, we are suppose to ask pple qns which can only ans "yes or no". Though it's lame, but we have fun and really interacted with the youths as well as the other team mates... [First name known.... Denly, the only boy in the grp of 8 youths]. Then, there's this part where we are to write our names on the masking tape and tape it on us. [Well, chinese names are harder to pronounce, so we cut our names...] WenRong > Rong (sala, wrong in Malay); me > Wei [hey hey]; Clarence > Clare; Revan > Ah Pek...etc so fun!  Then, we are being guided into their kampung areas. It is really an eye opening experience for me. Cos' those kampung, i have never seen them in Singapore before! We ask qns along the tour thru our "translator"  [our 4 noble people! Lynn, Huda, Shereene and Shafi. Well, im in Lynn's group].  However, the four groups become one big group. All the translators are too engaged with the lame riddles... and so, i stopped asking qns as I dont really have a chance to ask them... Then, I am like walking just for the sake of walking. Then, Mr Goh also teaches us something about some plants along the way, WOW thank god, at least there is smth that i can really engage in! Actually, I am  quite disappointed  with my team todae. Yes, you can have fun but in a more appropriate time! Dunno, I just have this kinda feeling todae... "One of the Kampung houses..." urlLink     urlLink     Back to the resort, during the debrief, the teachers 'shoot' us with todae's performance... *sigh* Hope that in the coming daes, we will perform better!
