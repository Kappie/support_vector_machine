Hmmm today is a very boring day, stay at home whole day doing nth but today is the last day for fairyland but seems lke i am not that sad after all.. The game is going to p2p tml and it cost $17.50sgd per month! omg i think few ppl will be willing to pay amt of money for a game! So I think I will be back playing Gunbound even tho it's a boring game oh ya and today she ask me to send her SMSes coz she will be bring hp to sch but she didn't even reply.. -_-" this is crap & may be is really time for me to forget abt her.. = ( think I will stop here and carry on blogging when i am free cya peeps!
