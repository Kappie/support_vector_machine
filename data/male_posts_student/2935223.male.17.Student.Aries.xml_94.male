So...last night(after beating FFCC) Rusty went to play practice, and I sat outside playing Golden Sun for two hours. It was supposed to be only one hour, but Rusty forgot to look at the second page of his schedule booky thing.  It was fine by me, I got to play video games. XD  Molly and Kathleen walked past and said Hi. They were on their way to the play just down the hall...area...thing. Then Rusty's practice got out just as the other play had it's intermission, so Molly and Kathleen talked to Rusty and I for a while.  We were on our way back to Rusty's house when we saw Kyle and Tom niking to Ervin's(who was at work) but we forgot to tell them. :-S Then we got back to Rusty's houseand we played badmitton for a while, I, of course, won. Fore I am the  BADMITTON GOD. FOOLISH MORTAL!  Then after that, we called Ervin to see if we could come over.....but he was at work. DOEY! So we decided to go for a swim instead. I got lots of water up my nose...that sucked.  Then we went inside and updated our blogs about how  WE PWNED FFCC HARDCORE!!!!  While we were doin' that, Ervin got home from work, and we chatted up a storm with him. He was bored, we were bored, we wanted to hang out, he wanted to hang out. We decided to have Ervin spend the night, too!  We preceded to go and pick him up, and on the way back, we really had an urge for Pizza. We stopped at Pizza Hut: CLOSED.  So we got to Ervin's...where I had to knock on the door for like 10 minutes before he got there. Then we decided to stop at Dominos and get pizza there instead. After we had decided what to order, we just sat and waited for our pizzas for like 1/2 an hour, and every girl that walked past the window we commented on, we had a good laugh. Then the pizzas got done and we drove back to Rusty's to eat them. Here's a piece of diologue in the car: Ervin:This is kinda erotic, havin' the hott pizzas right on my crotch. Rusty:Mm, mm, apple f waitaminute.  Spense:hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.....hahahaha......ha.....WHOO!  We got home and ate the pizzas, and then Ervin had never seen Something AboutMary, so we had to watch that. With Rusty, Ervin, and I sayin' "damn." like every two seconds......mm, mm Cameron Diaz.   OH!  I almost forgot to talk about how Rusty was practically falling asleep while eating the pizza, it was funny. Then during the movie I gave them the two last sodas....damn my big heart.  During the movie, Rusty got hot or sumthin' and took off his shirt....so I decided it was shirtless'o'clock, and took off my shirt too, and told Ervin to follow suit. Then when the movie got over, we had a shirt takin' off contest *pleeze for the love of GOD don't ask*     Then I started thinkin' about our 7th grade play, Lagooned. Rusty said he had it on video, and I wanted to watch it. Rusty was tired, so we didn't get to watch it. We went upstairs, where Ervin and Rusty played Magic until around 4:30ish, and I looked at old yearbooks.  Why were so many people pudgy in Middle School?!?!  including myself .     We heard some people movin' around and stuff, and then a car drive off at like 50 MPH. First thought in all of our heads: Who would be driving that fast at 3 in the morning? Oh well.   OH!!!  I almost forgot about pantsless'o'clock. Which is an actual time. It lasts from 4:04 till 5:04 A.M. Since we awake almost the whole time during that, we decided to celebrate it. I put my pants back on after like 15 minutes...so did Ervin. Rusty, however, didn't. That was kreepy.   When we were finally goin' to bed, Rusty was closing the blinds because the sun was coming up, and then he saw it. The toilet paper all over his small area of trees. The guard people had striked! We didn't pay attention to it really, and went to bed. 5 hours later at about 10:30, Rusty and I woke up. I immediately went outside to start cleaning up the toilet paper, which didn't take long, seeing as how the the guard did  THE SHITTIEST JOB OF TPING EVER!  It was seriosuly terrible, the best part of it was when I looked at the garage door and happened to see sumthing stuck to the door. I went to investigate...Spenser found a Maxipad glued to Rusty's garage door. I started laughing hysterically, and went inside to go get Rusty and show him. I thought it was hilarious. After cleaning everything up, Rusty and I went and beat FFCC for the SECOND time. That was fun, then he drove Ervin and me home. That leaves me here, typing this  UBER -long post. There was probably more in there sumwhere. I'm just too tired of typing to go into anymore detail. Alright, talk to you all later hopefully.  Spense!
