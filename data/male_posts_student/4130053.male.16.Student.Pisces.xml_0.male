Three days since the living room   I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you   Yesterday you'd forgiven me   but it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry     Yes! As the Barenaked Ladies song says, it's been 1 week. 1 long week in BC. It has gone flying by as I have been having so much fun! It has been an action packed week with tonnes of stuff to do! I ate Sushi for the first time, saw my first   CFL   game (GO BC!), played golf for the first time in 2 years, enjoyed take outs from   Boston Pizza   and   Dominos  ! U name it I did it!  Today we went to downtown Vancouver to visit the   Much Music Xbox Unleashed tour   and the   Yaletown Summer Celebration  . So we had trouble finding   City TV   (where   Unleashed   was) as  urlLink   Multimap.com    gave us really crap directions. When we finally found it, it was soooo crap we left after 5 minutes! All the   Xbox   games had been out for ages! So we left and went to Yaletown. It was really cool - so many classic cars and stalls! It was really fun to walk around!  We went to visit one of Dad's old employees Stefan, who manages the   Blue Water Cafe   in Yaletown. The restaurant is one of the most trendy and best places to eat in Vancouver, so when Uncle Nigel said we could go to the Sushi bar there, I was amazed! We had a Sushi platter which was so delicious, soooo much better than the takeaway. We sat at the bar where it was made and saw them prepare it. The Head Sushi Chef is one of the best in BC.   I bought some postcards (coming to a mailbox near you, soon! [I hope!]) to send and then went to   7-Eleven   to try their famous   Slurpee  ! It was really nice. I had   Pepsi   flavour. They're a bit like   Slush Puppies   or   Ice Blasts   in the UK but sooo much nicer!  Well after an eventful week, I'm amazed I still have money left! So BRING ON THE SPENDING!
