When that worm thing came out of that guy's ass, my dad left. Steven King is crazy. Now, what I need to do, is buy all Clive Barker books, movies, games, and other material, and read ALL of it, so i'll be as fucked up as he is. Why? I dunno. It sounds like it would reduce boredom when you can make someone throw up just by lookin at em.  :-O the Dynamix lockin is this saturday! whooo! I say Dynamix because apparentally the company thinks spelling words inkorecctly is totally kool TO THE MAX, and  by sounding hip will attract more angst-filled teens my age to buy into the team-building bullcrap. I got a game that'll keep me and AJ occupied, though. Cheeseballs!  Much like the Marshmallow skit from Blue Man Group, we just throw cheeseballs until we miss the catch, and... uhh... we'll come up with rules later.  Needta buy a big box o' cheeseballs. Like... from sams.. or something.
