Other than that it's all Blacks and Hispanics.  He happens to be white and most people weren't very polite to him on his way to my house from the train.  He was called a cracker twice and a white bitch once.  You know, we tend to complain a lot about white opression seeing as it is often times difficult to grow up and be successful as a minority, but what makes us better if we jeer at and make another person uncomfortable just because of the color of their skin.  We all need to take a step back and learn how to live with one another.  This kid is not a racist, nor would I befriend a racist.  But he was insulted anyway.
