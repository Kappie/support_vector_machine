It's a little known fact that when you say you're going to the Health Office, the Health Office grows in size to include the entire Paly campus(including the library) and Town  Country. It's a big Health Office, and I am in it as we speak.  I want to go to Rocky on Friday. A lot.   The Health Office was a technique I would come to use on multiple occasions, mostly my Junior year. I didn't end up going to Rocky that Friday, which I believe is mentioned in the next post.
