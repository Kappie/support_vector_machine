It's my first day in school, and already, you can see that the endless process of memorization is upon us (read the thing I said about school textbooks).  Over the next couple weeks, I'll have to memorize the Gettysburg Address, numerous chemicals of the periodic table, The Declaration of Independence, most---if not all---of the Amendments, and about more memorization then I can already remember.  Being a pessimist is a tough job, but someone has to bring down all the joy of those damn happy people.   Go America...........May Grey Davis burn in Hell...
