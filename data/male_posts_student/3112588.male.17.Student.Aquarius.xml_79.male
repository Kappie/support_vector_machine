MWAAHAHA..member laura?: "we're good at shopping--but we're also good at causing lots of damage!" LoL! oh man! good quotes last night too. "No, guys...this isnt the street!--It's Betty's Sister Donna!" LoL!!! dude, omg, i must have been laughing for like 5 minutes straight, and at my own joke none the less. hey, what do you expect? its like 12 in the morning, and i had a stressful day! haha...so, we get there, and my mom just like jumps out of the car with a thing of shaving cream, and just starts going wild all over jeremy's car--i've never seen her be that bad before! she was going crazy...but yeah, katy and i went to case the rest of the house, and saw that there were like 3 lights on...we TP'd anyway. after we had done all the damage necessary (ie--jeremy's car covered in shaving cream, with shredded newspaper and TP stuck to it/walkers house covered completely in TP, etc etc), we decided to jet...but not before MRS. WALKER CAUGHT us!! dude, it was so scary...she came up to us, and goes: "stand up pls"--she was talking to my mom, katy, and myself. so, i stood up, and she goes: "so what now?" being the honest person that i am, i said this: "well, they clean it up in the morning..just like we have to everytime they hit our house"...she had no idea what to say! LoL! it was great (katy: "umm..we're checking out the rims") LoL! good times! soo  she goes: "well...ok then! have fun you guys" (she blew us a little kiss goodnight, grabbed 2 rolls of TP, and went inside). she promised she wouldnt tell who it was, but it was quite funny, i tell you! what a great lady--but she knows her kids are bad, and they love to hit everyone's house--good times...laura drove home that night, and i didnt fear for my life as much as i thought i would--but the second we got to her house she told us that she had never driven at night, and she didnt even have her permit on her LoL!!! dude, omg--im so proud of you laura!! my little white driver...good times. well, im sick today, but sara's party is tonight. im not exactly sure what im going to be doing, but....call me anyone, please. bye!
