Screw it, I got sick. :( Julie had a cough or something and gave it to me. *sniff sniffzZ* It's so annoying. I hate getting sick. Blah.   The unni at the Maxine place (Korean store) put pins in the places where I wanted them to make alterations and the pins poked my arm. OuchiezZ~! T^T  Talking to Moca on MSN. Yeah, we're (the group) is planning on asking for help from Arbo. Really talented in music.   So yeah... there was some stuff bothering me lately but it's nothing. Just got me thinking. Nothing "BAD" bad... at least I don't think. It's in the near future though. Blah... cherish what we have now instead of thinking ahead too much. Stop and smell the roses. Gosh, I'm sounding like Wilfred. :S  Alice just came online. Said "howdy" and she said "heeeeyyy". Haha. Joking around with Moca too. Something seems to be wrong with Edward. Something about Celina. He seemed a lot happier the last time I spoke with him. Now he's all... gloomy. Gonna talk to him the next chance I get to. Can't talk to him now on MSN though because of time restrictions.   Girl/personal part... guys may want to take caution in this part of the blog.  So yeah, before I set out to try on my grad dress, my mom told me to put on a strapless bra and I'm like: "Ewww! Why?" and whining and stuff and she wanted me to put it on so that I won't have a strap in the way when I try on my grad dress... Very annoying. I'm not used to wearing strapless bras (usually wear sports bras) and now that I got used to wearing it for a while, it feels weird again in my sports bra. Jeez, annoyingness. Oh my gosh... just made me realize that I'm gonna have to wear a strapless bra at the night of grad! NooooOOOOOooo! Ahh! Haha! I'm such a freak! So yeah, just decided to put out my thoughts about that on blog... after all, it IS a blog.  End of girl-ish part of blog.   Haha! Moca just told me that she got a pin from Anime North and the pin said "Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't." Haha! Hilarious! It's supposed to be "Those who live by the sword, die by the sword." It's what Jesus said in Passion Of The Christ. Hee hee...! Funnyness!   I'm so bored. :( Man, I can blog all day! Haha! Alice told me to call Nima but... nah. He's probably busy or something. And plus, I don't wanna bother/annoy him or anything 'cos I usually call quite a bit and yeah. Meh, whatever. Isn't he out with his mom or something? Iunno... blah.  Bleh, gonna go now. Probably won't blog until June? Don't know. I might be able to sneak on once in a while... like in computer class or something... well, I'm off. Peace out.
