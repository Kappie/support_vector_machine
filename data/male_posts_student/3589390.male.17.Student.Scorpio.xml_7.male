Firstly, a couple days ago I had some birthday party I went to for Norbert and Derek at Evan's Skateland. Oh boy was that interesting...I got my disco pants, a whit shirt and some "bling" and tore it up skating...hah yeah, sure. No, it was awesome though, I made Derek and Norbert their cards because I had no time to go out and buy them some, and then shoved a check in each of their cards for $15.28 each just so I wouldn't have that extra $0.56 laying around in my checking account. ::shrug:: I'm weird, oh well..  Yesterday... Well I woke up extra earlier for work (which started at 10) because I was going to have to catch a bus up to the mall because nobody was home...So...I do so, get to the bus stop around 8:40 and wait 'til 8:48 which (it was right in the correct 8:45-8:50 range I was told and even was on the right route) and got on...Did I mention it was heading northbound instead of southbound which is what I thought I needed to get on? Eh, regardless we were going and I thought we were just going to swing around on to Peach St. but...no. After a half hour, we're down at the Blasco Library, me..running out of time because I still needed to walk to work from the Mall and well, things weren't looking too great. After having to pick up some elderly people and a handicapped kid, time was running out even quicker and so at around 9:46 I got off the bus at the EXACT same spot I got on at with only 14 minutes to get to work. I run home wake my sister up and tell her I'm taking the car even though I only have my permit..oh well! I end up leaving the house around 9:51 and get up to Tinseltown, clock in (before my co-workers) with 3 minutes to spare. I was so relieved. So I call my sister and tell her what happened and she tells me not to tell my mom because she may kill me so...yeah. I called my brother who lives relatively close to us and asked him to meet me at the house around 12:45. So around 12:30 I left work for my break, met my brother at the house and got a ride back with him to work.. When I got my ride home from work at 4 I was wondering if I should tell my mom so...I do because I didn't think she'd be angry..well. I was right she wasn't angry about me taking the car, but rather about me getting the wrong bus after she "specifically" told me which one to take..sure. Oh well, it was all interesting, like a stupid little one episode sitcom. Anyways, that night I ended up going back out to Tinseltown and saw Stepford Wives with Vonda, and ended up seeing a few others up there..It was, eh..alright, nothing spectacular, and incredibly predictable. Oh well..  Uh...yeah. BYE.
