On a lighter note, today went pretty well. I woke up and got on the computer :D! Except, the keyboard didn't work :(. It's a bitch to use on-screen keyboard. Usually I type around 75 WPM; not on the on-screen keyboard. Onscreen keyboard consists of a picture of a keyboard in which you click the keys. It's exhausting.After the strenuous activity of clicking keys, I headed to the pool with Mike. Very relaxing; I especially liked the part where I had six seven-year-olds swimming around me with goggles. We talked to the lifeguard (My neighbor) most of the time. Later Mike and I called Jason, and we played megaman for the rest of the day. We're just that cool.     Warped Tour   Katie called me last night, and she told me she could go! :D! I'm going to the warped tour.     .Characters    Mike  - Friend in Illinois.   Lifeguard  - Different Mike; my neighbor.
