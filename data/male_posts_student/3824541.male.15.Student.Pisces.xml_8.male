I saw all but one of the bands that I wanted to see, and I didn't mind. I crowdsurfed, moshed (unintentionally), and jumped around. It fucking owned me. I would go again in a flash.   (Songlist at bottom)    ..My W a r p e d  Day  We got to the warped tour at about 12:45. Because I had heard Story of the year while standing on line for Jason's ticket, I decided to search them out. Don't trust me for directions :(. It took me 20 minutes to walk what should've taken me five or ten. We caught their last two songs, and then we headed towards Rufio. After waiting half an hour for them, we found out they decided to switch times. We had no clue when they would be back, but it was ok. I only know like one of their songs.  Well, we had been there for about an hour and seen two halves of a concert.We decidedon NFGandwalked towards them.We got in the middle of the crowd, but we wereway too cramped and Katie couldn't see :(. We left after their first song, but luckily, it was my favorite song by them. We decided we needed to get to the next band we wanted to see early. So, we headed towards Simple Plan. On the way I bought an Atticus shirt for $15 and a CD for $5. Eh, I never really liked Simple Plan, but I wanted to see someone up-close. I now have a new respect for them. They got out, and the crowd was really hyped up, and after getting over my shyness I went crowdsurfing :D! I asked some guy to throw me up, and he was nice enough to do it. Thanks guy :D! It feels as though you're flying. I ended up kicking a few people, but I guess it's all in the fun of crowdsurfing.  After SP Jason and Katie were hungry.I thought Coheed was on next, and I didn't mind missing them.Wetook about half an hour break in the hopes I would be back in time to catch Coheed's performance, but not really get too involved.We got some lunch (A slice of pizza and two waters for me for $12), and headed back towards Coheed. On our way to Coheed we were surprised to hear 'Blink' because Blink wasn't at the tour this year. Suddenly, I realized it wasn't Blink. It was Yellowcard. I pushed my way through the people towards the middle, and I crowdsurfed to the front. That was the defining moment: crowdsurfing during one of my favorite band's concerts. There was a massive mosh pit Katie and I got caught in, but it was so much fun.  After YC, I was afraid Sugarcult might be on next (Because they had changed the schedule for YC). We waited about half an hour, and found out Bad Religion was on. We listened to their first song, and walked around for awhile. I decorated my cellphone with Yellowcard stickers 'tackily.' I also grabbed a bunch of necklace thingys (Below). Katie bought a YC shirt for her sister, and Jason and me debated on what we wanted.  We got back to the Brian stage in time for Flogging Molly; one of my favorite bands. They created the most enjoyable show. From talking to their fans about their hair to the Irish-circle-jig everyone started. I didn't crowdsurf because everyone was going crazy. I knew three of their songs :D! The atmosphere was great. Everyone was jumping and clapping to the Irish jig.  After Flogging Molly Katie headed towards the Yellowcard booth to get her sister's shirt signed. She got the guitarist's signature. I wanted to get my cellphone signed, but I forgot :(.  While Katie and me were at the YC booth, Jason went to get something to eat. Katie and I watched NOFX for awhile, and then looked at all of the booths (There are so many; each band has their own booth) . I finally decided ona Warped tour shirt ($15). I wanted proof I went :D! Later, when we met back up with Jason, we got to see the end of Coheed. Kind of a disappointment, actually. Like, they sounded really good, but the atmosphere was boring. They kept expecting everybody to know the words at the most awkward times.  Because Sugarcult was playing on the same stage Coheed was playing on, wedecided to get to the Sugarcult concert early. The Sugarcult was a great concert, but very painful. Everybody decided to crowdsurf at once. I had atleast 8 people land on my head. During their third song I had to leave; a crowdsurfer knocked my glasses off, and they were bent (They're ok now). Sugarcult was extremely good though. They really tie with Flogging Molly and Yellowcard. They surprised everyone when they started early, and played my favorite songs of theirs. We left at about 9:15.  The Warped Tour was so much more than that though. I didn't get to discuss the moshing, and exactly how I crowdsurfed. I didn't get to talk about the millions of booths, and that it was extremely well planned. Something was always going on. There were even four stages for garage/local bands. If you want to know more contact me.   As of now, I'm exhausted. The trip was the greatest trip I've had since I moved.
