Apparently there is, but hey, I'm not the sociable type. Err, I've kind of done my geography coursework, but not finalised it. I've done all the big parts of writing, but haven't put it all together. I really don't know what to write here, I have absolutely nothing to do. Well, I could revise for my GCSE exams, starting in about 2 months... bugger...that soon? Oh well. That would be boring. So, stuff I intend to do over the Summer. Definately build a Zepplin. That would be so cool. How hard could it be...? Maybe only a model one to start off with. A small motor attatched to a box hanging from loads of helium balloons... can't be that hard. Also learn Esperanto. That would be nice, it doesn't look that hard... Then I could talk to... err... someone elso who knows it.  Ok, I really can't be bothered to write anything else, so bye all.
