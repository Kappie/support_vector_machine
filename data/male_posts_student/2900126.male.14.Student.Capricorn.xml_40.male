For some reason I'm still mourning over the fact that I didn't make it into Algebra 2,I studied hard and did all I could to succeed. I tried to ask for help and all that good stuff. I mean I went into that test confident that I was going to pass and hear Mrs. Brennan say those all powerful and satisfying words to me " Alonzo you will be in Algebra 2" but no the words never passed her lips. I asked her "Did I pass the test?" she she boldly with not regret replied instantly " No you didn't but I'll show you your test Wednesday." I don't know anybody that wanted to be in Algebra 2 as much as I did. I mean, it meant so much to me. ( believe it or not I'm crying right now because of this) Because I had set in my mind that I was going to prove to all those people in that classroom that I was as smart as they were maybe not smarter but at least as smart as them. But no the only thing I thought I was great at, which was academics, failed me. Sometimes I wish I were never born and thenm I wouldn't have to deal with having to get F's and be critisized because I read slower than other people and that I don't catch on to things as well as others. And to see everybody else move on like Chichi, Sonya, LinZ, and all the rest of my friends,to see them happy makes me feel like I shouldn't even be considered their friend. Someties I feel like I'm there for comfort and I'm just a guy who is sure who he is and nobody can figure that out but me and only me. and the fact that I am still crying makes me feel even worse because I don't like to show my weaknesses to the world and I consider academic failure  a weakness. Even though I always joked about getting F's on my algebra tests on the inside I was crying because I was never used to get bad grades and I hated it and I felt like I was letting my whole family down because I was considered the smart oine the one the gets the best grades, the one that was destined to be something great, but on the inside I'm jsut some kind that thinks he's actually has thew talent to be a veterinarian or a zoologist although I am allergic to cat and dog dander. I never thought that my feelings were this deep and if I think that the only reason I am on this earth is for failure to succeed then I am just making myself feel worse but. Like I always say everything happens for a reason, but what reason is there for the only hope that I had to prove to myself and to others that I actually was smart to be crushed like an ant that is smash by a curious child? I mean I really don't know what's wrong with me, I'm crying over a stupid test that I took 3 maybe 4 months ago, but the reason for this drama is because Mrs. Brennan made the test seem larger than life itself, like it I passed this test I would be proud of myself and actually have an ounces of confidence that I would actually do something good in my life, but instead I failed a test that means so much to me and confidence levels drowns in a pitch black abyss of failure to succeed and prove to myself who I am and who I will be. And then when my friends comfort me I say that I'm fine when in actuality I am lying to them because they made me feel good for maybe 30 minutes and then all of those feeling come tumbling down on me again. I just feel like a complete and TOTAL IDIOT to think that my unimportant exsistance would actually mean something to allof those people out there. I just to tell myself that I was useless, worthless, and invisible to the world, well what do you know my past has come back to haunt me, and all I feel is pain because I have failed my family and my friends because they are reading this and then they feel like they have to comfort me and try to make me feel better.  I'm sorry guys that I wrote this whole blog abpuit what I haven't achieved and stuff but I had to get it out. I love you guys and sorry I guess I'll talk to you later * continues to cry as he publishes this for all to read*
