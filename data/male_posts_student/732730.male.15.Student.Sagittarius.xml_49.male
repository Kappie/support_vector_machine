But this week has just been strange. It was an emotional rollercoaster! On tuesday I was the epitome of depressed because I didn't want to be back at school. We got new timetables though. But they just made me more depressed because it turns out I have quadruple maths in friday. Yes, thats right! Maths C, Maths C, recess, Maths B, Maths B. Then Chemistry and Applied Maths (Physics) after lunch. Yay.  Then, on wednesday, something happened in Core P.E. that really made me feel... weird! Tanya was like lieing on me and we were talking and it was like "woah". Maybe thats the emotional rollercoaster thing though. BUT! Tim got his hair cut and woah! He looks really, really hot! I was shocked. But enough about Tim. It seemed like I connected with Emma and Tanya and stuff... I was speaking to them both heaps I think.   Today was strange. Ella made me piggy back her (not made, I guess. I coulda said no!) to the library for German. Then while we were listening to an audio from the CD, she sat behind me on the chair, and wow. It felt so right! ... How bizarre?!  Speaking of love, or lack there of, me and Kieran haven't spoken in what seems like ages! Why? Well, we had a fight? Why? Because he wanted some time apart. Why? STOP SAYING WHY! But seriously, he didn't say why.  We didn't speak for a few days and then he texted me saying "you can call me if you want". I said to myself "you were the one who didn't want to talk" and I ignored it. He rang me a few times while I've been asleep, but I haven't returned his calls. I guess I'm a bit pissed off. While we were talking he often said "I don't know why you keep putting up with my shit". Ha, me either. So, as the classics say, "the manure has hit the mistrel". Nice, eh?  On wednesday night I spoke with Sana for the first time in ages. And we're bonding like rabbits "bond". HA! But nah, it's like it was aaggeess ago.  For the first time in ages it seems like some stuff is going right in my life!  Except for the fact that I'm lacking a boyfriend or girlfriend. Ya know, I've been falling asleep all teary eyed 'coz I want someone to hold  that  bad! Well, reading  urlLink The Least of These  (a  great  story about two gay lovers, and there trials and tribulations). Seriously, it's good. Even if you're not gay, just read it and skip the sex bits! I was quite emotional at times!   OH SHIT. And now "Ghost of a Good Thing" by Dashboard Confessional is playing in iTunes. AND IM ALL TEARY EYED!  HOLY SHIT. What is going down in Adam-land! Even Corinne and I bonded for a bit today. I'm shocked!  And Ellen! She was shocked that I was in such a good mood. She even noticed.  It seems like I haven't been this good for ages!  All I need is a S.O. Please...!
