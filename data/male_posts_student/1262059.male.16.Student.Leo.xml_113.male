I just wanted to see if I could still play ^^ maybe i'll spend the lunchtimes of this week in the chess room... who knows...   Ahh... didn't get much done tonight, which sucks, but tomorrow my Focus group is meeting, so i'll  have  to work.    Yesterday was fun, even though we didn't get to watch the second part of Sen To Chihiro (Spirited Away - which btw won an Oscar... ph34r anime and itz l33t skillz!!), hoshi-chan came over to ward, so I spent that time talking to keane and her... though  of course  I let them have a little alone time ne? *3vil l4ff*    Next week, I'll have to be checking in with another TA... my TA's off to Europe for a week and a half, along with a heck of a lot of other music students... I hear they're going to Germany and Austria and... *sees Hoshi getting mad* eh heh heh heh...    ~Chronos
