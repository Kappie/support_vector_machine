I was so happy and excited when I wokeup this morning, saying "We recruited them and they came.  They said "Sure why not?  We'll come to Notre Dame, IN!"  And so it came to be St. Mary's babes, recruiting at its finest!   I got to see them on my way to Ivy Tech to get my books at the bookstore.  Two of them were standing on the pillar.  I didn't think they would be standing.  They ususally sit on them and wave to the incoming cars.   There was two brunettes and I think the other was a blonde.  I liked one of the brunettes on the left side, I didn't look too much since she probably wasn't interested.   I got my account for Financial Aide setup at Ivy Tech.  I found my Algebra book after looking for like 10 minutes, to my disarray.  I bought a legal pad so I can practice the Math problems on there and during tutoring.  I also bought a Graphing Calculator which kicks major ass over the regular scientific calculator, I can't wait to start using it.  It will take awhile to master but it should be fun in the end.  I was worried I wouldn't have enough Financial Aide money in the end but it went through.  Then I was still worrying about afterwards when in the Cybercafe and I went back to the Financial Aide to ask them about it.  They said I had $400 and I had only used $248 so I'm glad because I didn't want to owe a bunch of money for the calculator.   I realized when I was waiting for the bus that I would have to use two dimes and a nickel to pay the fare since they are being stupid during this Customer Appreciation week which is a slap in the face for people like me who use a Handicard since you have to pay more each way than you would with the 35 cents fare, it adds up to 50 cents and no transfer so its screwed up, doesn't help me at all.  Only helps the people who pay the regular fare.   Finally the ride on the #5 bus and the moment of great anticipation has arrived.  Would the girls wave when we went by in the bus or would it turn into a bad memory like it did in 2001?  Sure enough, the worst did come true.  None of them waved, they were too busy talking with each other, this brunette just stares at us and I think I frowned at her, she frowns back.  It was to show her that they should have waved and I was not happy.  Waited for this moment for months, only to be let down in the end, its really depressing.  I'm still glad I got my book though and my Graphing Calculator, its always fun going there, I enjoy it since I get the stuff for free with Financial Aide.   The weather is so pleasant today too, in the 70's and somewhat sunny, absolutetly great outside and I like it a lot.   The other good thing that happened today was the Machine Shop at Ivy Tech called me and this guy wants me to come in for Work Study so I think I will get a job, finally!  I'm so excited, even if its not a computer or clerical job like I wanted to do for experience, I will finally have some money that the bastard can't take away from me.  And also I hope then I get a Tax Refund next year, if I do, I'll be even more happy, maybe 2004 will turn out to be good, we'll have to wait and see, only time will tell.   4 is the number of Aquarius so maybe it will help me in the end, I hope it won't just be good luck for David and not me.  He has enough good luck and I'm the one who needs it more than he does.  He should have to suffer with bad luck for awhile and then he'll see what I am going through, he never has to though or not for long except for that surgery.  Which is all done and he has not any pain.
