It was mostly a "standard" reply but it did have a little personalization to it, basically they were going to forward the idea to the proper department.  Since I haven't yet posted the keyword feature request here, I guess I will do so today...  I would like to be able to add "keywords" to a conservation.  So that I can search by keywords only, or add additional keywords that might not be in the conservation.  For example I had a recent email back and forth about an additional invitation to gmail, but not once did I mention "gmail" so if I searched for gmail on my system nothing comes back.  It would be nice to be able to additional keywords for filing reasons and examples such as the previous one.
