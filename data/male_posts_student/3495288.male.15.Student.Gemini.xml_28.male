I had fun and laughter, angst and sadness, love and depression for this few days. What such fun. Well thank god there is such thing as National Day! yay! There is no school on Monday and Tuesday! I love National Day, i just love to feel and smell of unity in everyone of us, just like waking up in a bed full of nice smelling flowers and not a room full of smelly socks. hahah.    Yesterday had half day of school, so everyone was dismissed early. I came to school just in time. I caught up with the other band majors and some of the percussion members. The School's Uniform Group had a National Day Marching Parade and the Band was not in the Parade as we are packed in schedule so they asked for a few members from the percussion section to play the marching beat. I helped out in carrying the chairs and instruments, thats why i wasn't there during USSR (aka reading period). The majors and i stood at the DnT block as if we were part of the parade. Many eye balls were staring at us when we stood in attention. Well we had fun commenting the peeps that were in uniform. After all those shouting from the Parade Commander, the number of us went back into the music room to keep the instruments. We were in there for queit sometime. When i carried the Bass Drum into the music room, i felt some one touched my shoulder and the touch faded away at my elbow. I turned both sides but there was no one there. I just ignored it, thought it was the wind. Once all instruments was kept, i played at the electrical piano. I played a part from the Phatom of the Opera song. While playing i felt someone holding my waist but it soon faded away when i turned back, which practically there was no one behind me. I got abit scared. Soon Syazwanie and Mei Hui sat at the computer table and did some paper work. All of the sudden the sliding key board desk moved out, not a small distance but a large distance with a force! They shouted and asked us to leave the room quickly. Within a minute we were out. Scared and shocked. We can't stopped thinking of it. "Ai yo! The Hand has returned!", shouted my senior. We were shocked that there was a ghost in our school. He told us that the first batch of seniors, who had graduated a long time ago, had slept in the music room. Some said they saw a white figure floating across the room and some said that they felt a deteched hand walked across their body. We were spooked when we heard that. For the rest of the day, the three of us were traumatised. Well okie lets skip the whole afternoon and go on. Well okie after all that spookness, i went home had a long rest and had a self gymnastic training which was kind of a success. After that i went to meet Daniel at his school. I was kind of worried because he had told me that he would call me before the day it self but he did not call me. When i was just two bus stops away from his school he called me. Well we met up yesterday was to watch AC Superstar, something like Singapore Idol lor. I waited for him for about 20-35 mins. The show started a little late thought, so its kinda lucky heheh. The show was okie, i like the audition videos, really funny. Then there was a 10mins break, i had to use the toilet so i asked Daniel to show me where was it. After that he guided me through his school. Very big and dark leh the school. Very good for any night activities, haha. The Library is really big! Well we had to go up this really dark stair case, its pitched dark in there... its hard for me to see as i am not used to the place. My right hand had the urge to hold Daniel's hand but i controlled my self. hahaha. (Thanks Daniel for the school tour.  I will show you my school one day, if there is a such day hahah.) I remembered those words from my friends, " Don't forget to give him a good kiss if you are in the dark." I decided not to kiss him because i don't know what will be his reaction and somemore we have discussed about a few issues so i am kind of confused if i should just move on with life a lone or be with someone else. Well after the tour, we went back to the auditorium. The host said that lucky 500 peeps can vote for their idol and the voting paper is under the selected chairs. When Daniel searched under his, there was one (lucky him), but mine did not have. Well this nice prefect/usher guy asked me if i wanted the voting paper as there is one under his, i just nodded my head like a small miniture noddy toy haha. I voted really strictly as i think non of the singers have good voice. I love the Evil Judge, i support him all the way with his bad comments. There is this guy from the live band, he played a variety of Saxs! so good!. Well after all those nonsence. Daniel showed me around the school again. He showed me his boarding school, the field, the tracks, the seats, the pool and lots more. He wanted to show me which toilet he had done it but i just acted clueless. We sat down and chatted for a while and waited for his mom to pick him up. He told me not to let his mom see me as his mother is a bit racist. (sorry Daniel if i had to use that word... i am experiencing Racism in my life now.) I waited for a few minutes till his mom went off. Once they were gone, i reluctently waited for the bus. Went home all alone again and another hour of my life passed in travelling back and forth. I am used to all this as i used to totally spend 2hrs and 50mins of my life going back and forth from woodlands to sengkang via train just to meet HIM but luckily there is a bus that goes directly there.  ---------------------------------------------------------  Today-   Well woke up early to go to school today as i have Band today. Did the usual stuffs and all, after band we recieved a new percussion instrument, i forgot its name hahah. Well after that i went home and rested for a while till 6:30pm. I had to go for a meeting with my TEATER VARIASI friends. Well after the meeting, Hamzah told me and Rashid that we are now going to be part of the next production and will be made official once we fill in this form and paste our ugly faces on the form with a passport sized photo. Had fun and all. Well happy now that i am going to act in a new production which will be premiering Next YEAR! COOL!  Well till here lah. I gtg and sleep. Really superbly tired. Take care and Hugs and Kisses to all. Bubbye.
