As last year's External Affairs Executive, Jeff gathered contacts and supporters within the news media and other community organizations and hopes to put those to good use this year. He also writes a political column for the campus newspaper, The Bricklayer, and is the President of the Political Science Society.  Jeff is a libra, bisexual, and deejays at the FarSide Lounge and elsewhere!    Jeff is also your (Red Deer's) official nominee for the Federal NDP party in the upcoming election. If you are concerned with freedom, democracy, health care, and human rights, vote NDP this year.  Vote for Jeff!
