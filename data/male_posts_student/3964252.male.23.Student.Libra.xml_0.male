We've been busy bees trying to get everything ready for the BIG REVEAL of moving into this PHAT new house. The Master bedroom is awesome....Michael and I have all this space to put our stuff in, and lordy have we bought stuff to fill it! I hope everything goes the way we think it will in there...We are going with a modern theme, which is about a 180 from what we had origianlly planned...we wanted a sophisticated look in the bedroom and a tropical feel to the bathroom, but I think we have made the right decision to go with modern. We are getting new bedding (can you say Sateen sheets???), which is something we've wanted for 8 months!!! The rest of the house is great as well...everyone has their own bathroom and schoenherr even gets her very own fenced-in backyard, which will make everyone happy. Since we've moved up in the world to this fabulous house, it wouldn't have been complete with ordinary cable...SOOOO..we are getting satellite with over 180 channels on it...I've never lived anywhere with a satellite before, so it'll be awesome. Even the kitties will enjoy it, I believe :)...YES, they talk to me!!!! We are gonna have to have an awesome housewarming party when the government pays us in mid August..LOL...well, I suppose I'll get back to work doing nothing...but the times a tickingon this job as well :)
