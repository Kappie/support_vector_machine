A bountiful harvest of books and DvDs was wrought, and all was well. Now no one can say I don't own Season Three of the Simpsons, Futurama, or South Park or Seasons One and Two of Strangers with Candy. If my taste in TV doesn't tell one anything about me, well that makes sense. A person isn't defined by their favorite TV Shows - I mean come on, Sam Ryan loves the Chappelle Show and he's still a fairly decent human being, right?  No I kid my dear readers - Chappelle Show isn't half bad. Speaking of readers, I've seem to been graced with some of a much higher class as of late. Though I know not what luck allowed them to pass my little corner of the world wide web, I can be assured of one thing -  a vast feeling of being underwhelmed and anti-climax. None-the-less I shall soldier on, confident that even intelligent readers may forgive the pit they've fallen into. And too prove that I'll never be done flirting on a mediurm that is essentially the bathroom wall writing of the world, my newest readers are prettier, funnier, more charming, and overall better people as well. PLEASE LOVE ME!  Sorry, I seemed to have regressed back to my youth. Back to Tyson. Not only am I still behind in my history reading, I have found a critical error in my quest - the lack of notes. If I am seriously to take that AP without the class, I should take notes over the plethora of books I am reading, to grant a better memory on that ever nearer day in May. Also, I have yet to look over Latin. Shit me on a shit stick. That class will be the death on me, and though one could liken it to an airplane slowly descending into the Peruvian Alps, where the survivors will be forced to eat the dead for sustenance, the group whom I share the class with have made it as enjoying as hell - not an exception among the bunch. Except for Corbett. I hate you Corbett (OMG LOL ROFLMAO JK!)   While on the topics of airplanes, I will be on one in a matter of tens of hous. I am traveling to the Windy City for a nuclear family reunion with our father as parent attendant. It should be fun - I haven't been to Chicago since last year's Thespian Trip. Ahh, all the fond memories of being thrown out of a hotel's private party and Jesse and Jimmy being mugged becuase they were stupid enough to ask a huge (black, if thats important) homeless guy in a back alley for directions to Walgreens. A real couple of bright bulbs there, aren't they? Well Mr. Browning, stressed from from our 'mischeveous' antics (I swear I didn't know it was a  Private  Party!), refused to allow another Thespian trip - but this should make up for it somewhat. We'll see Second City, go to the Billy Goat Tavern - pretty sweet. Along with a Bull's Game and dinner at RL (Ralph Lauren's exclusive and most likely mediocre restruant), it should be a good time overall.  Hmm. I seem to use hyphens alot in my writing. Is that a sign of being contrived and having poor english skills? Discuss, as I still need to pack.
