Thats why making Jazz Band was so important to me, it makes me feel like I'm really, really good but now I feel like everyone is watching me to see if I'm as good as he is. Now I guess since I'm first chair now, with no practice, I might skip over to the eighth grade orch. if I DO practice...hmm...Or else I'll just be really, really, really good...Or maybe its because the other three are really, really bad...  Marten and Sofa:  You know what'll be really funny?! When I  have Mr. Hall and I pass his class like its nothing. lol but the way you guys are talking I probably wont...poopoo.. SQuEE!
