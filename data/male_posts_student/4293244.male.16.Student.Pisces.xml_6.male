I'm bored with lots of stuff, I'm building up some goddamn repetoire of stuff to be bored with. I've read a few blogs, they're alright, I guess I could start off my first one with politics, that's always an easy one and who else but President George Bush could make politics so damn interesting. I guess an idiot can do lots of stuff when he puts his mind to it. I've been looking around for combat footage of the war in Iraq and besides seeing hundreds of APC's and tanks rumbling about picturesque villages and soldiers with M16s propped up in the crook of their elbow there hasn't been much. What do you expect when you can't film coffins though? Out of the hundreds of reporters embedded with those units in the beginning you'd think there'd be some real footages besides audio of shots being fired while the camera ducks behind a wall. And I still hear the words combat correspondent thrown around, it should be enough to make Robert Capa turn over in his grave. If there's people with enough balls to shoot the guns then surely there's some who will stand by and brave all the legal nonsense thrown up by the US government. But then I suppose all those people have long sold their souls to businesses that can copyright and back it up with lawyers. Don't think I'm opposed to capitalism, it's the best system there is, it just sucks, often and hard. Not that that's in anyways Bush fault, no I blame the patriot act on him and Dick Cheney. 911 had all the democrats rolling over and taking it from the republicans, and for once we all see exactly what a nonpartisan government can do, totally screw it all up. I say partisan is a good thing, throw as much partisanism into the mix, and make about five groups, and have them fight it out on the senate floor and don't let them come out until they're done and mostly happy. No one wants everyone to be happy, then you're in trouble. So I advocate the creation of a third party, not the Green Party or any other gun nut, tree hugging party. So get to that. And since you can't tell I say that with a certain degree of sarcasm, a third party now seems about as realistic as birds cleaning up their own droppings.      Anybody know anything about combat footage from Iraq or Bush, or anybody know anything... atall...please.
