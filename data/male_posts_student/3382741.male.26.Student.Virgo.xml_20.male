He permeates my thoughts and feelings ... taking it slow or not it's already to late to "not get hurt" if somehow it doesn't work out.  This is not to say that I am not still going to try to take it slow.  Still think it's possible that going to fast will had an adverse effect on the relationship, so I am still all for taking it slow, but man I can barely stand the time apart sometimes.  I haven't seen him since Monday and I really am not sure there are words in the English language to describe how I miss him.  It's just been so incredible to feel a closeness to someone and have that feeling returned.  I went to a movie Tues night with a friend and even though I really enjoyed the movie and had a nice time - the whole time I sat there all I could think about was David and how I wanted him to be there.  Am I being stupid?  Am I running headlong for a heart break?  I sure hope not, and I don't think so ... there is something differnt this time.  I can't quite put my finger on it - maybe it's the frist time this strong of feelings has been there on both sides?  Who knows; but I am prepared to ride this train to where-ever it leads me.
