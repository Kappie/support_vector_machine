Today's topic is: Random Things That Have Popped Into My Head In The Past Few Days.  1) When browsing through the CD collection at your local public library, please reseat all of the CDs you have flipped forward. It will save the library staff muchos pesos on Advil.  2) Don't you hate it when you accidentally drop something, make an amazing diving/rolling/what-have-you catch, and no one is around to see it?  3)  urlLink Luigi's Conjecture . What a brilliant idea. I must test this newfound theory over the next couple of weeks. Kudos, Scratchy.  Subconsciousness calls, so that is all for now. Until next time!
