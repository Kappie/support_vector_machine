It was easy to watch and made some "thought provoking" points. Nonetheless, Mike makes some broad assumptions that do not survive strict scientific scrutiny. The movie really is Mike's theory on why there is a bevy of gun violence in the US. The short of his theory is: "it's all Charlton Heston's fault". The long of it seems to place the blame at the foot of ineffective gun control laws, a culture of fear created by the mass media, and the fact the US is not a socialist country. I agree with his first claim, and disagree with his last. His second was probably the most salient point Mike made. Although I watch very little TV other than movies and South Park (which had a prominent part in the movie), I agree wholeheartedly that the mass media in this country profit off of fear.  See generally  Local News. Whether it be that purse snatcher in the bushes or that chemical weapons toting terrorist, the media wants you scared and watching. Speaking of broad generalizations, Mike does make use of a true broad generalization: most Americans know zero about history and foreign policy. He makes effective use of examples of America flexing its military might to pursue our national interests to paint our government as a violent entity bent on launching tomahawk cruise missiles at anyone who we dislike. An over simplification to say the least.  I not going to even bother  with that one.   Mike's movie was significantly based on anecdotal evidence in the US and Canada. Makes for great entertainment but bad science. In the end, will Mike make any real progress in determining what causes the violence in this country, probably not, but at least he'll get the masses to think about it which in the end is a plus.
