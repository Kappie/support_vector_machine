On my first trip there, Luis Donaldo Colosio, a reformer and candidate for the presidency, was assassinated in Tijuana.  Years later, I was present for the election of Vicente Fox.  I remember the car horns blaring and the celebrations.       On Friday, July 23, when I arrived in Mexico City, charges of genocide were filed against Mexican ex-President Luis Echeverria.  The next day they were thrown out due to a statute of limitations.  It will not surprise me if Echeverria, who ruled the country with total power from 1970-1976, dies a free man, despite the fact that Saturday's decision is being appealed to the Supreme Court.         Luis Echeverria and others like him (the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and the French Vichy collaborator Maurice Papon spring to mind) are old men now, and the regimes they led or served belong to another era.  But especially when I was actually on Mexican soil, I couldn't help feel the tragedy of Echeverria's escape from justice.   It is a catastrophe, a seething catastrophe.    This man should be forgiven, as all men should, yet he ought not escape trial.  As Interior Minister under President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, and later as President himself, Echeverria was surely aware of, complicit in, and, ultimately, responsible for the repression of dissidents and the killing of many students.  For example, Diaz Ordaz and Echeverria had everything to do with what happened at Tlatelolco.       If somehow he were forced to acknowledge his guilt, perhaps Echeverria would defend himself by declaring that his crimes were justified by the exigencies of the Cold War.  After all, such an argument has been advanced by many of Echeverria's supporters.       But who can buy it?       As President, Echeverria was a big leftist -- particularly when he travelled abroad.  He was "Mr. Nonaligned" and Mr. "Tercermundista."  His government had close ties with Fidel Castro.  Rhetorically at least, it allied itself with the Marxist liberation movements in Africa and in Asia.   Echeverria spent enormous amounts of money on government superprojects, as did his recently deceased sucessor Jose Lopez Portillo, who built himself an enormous mansion on the outskirts of Mexico City and proclaimed loudly that his nation's newfound oil wealth would catapult it into the ranks of the First World, thanks to massive outlays.  No doubt, Echeverria and leaders like him were good at the old style fakery.  They were the kind who grandiloquently hosted Spanish Civil War Republican veterans and writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, so as to parrrot their moral supremacy while simultaneously "taking care" of Mexican youths who fell too far out of line.       Now the great President is old.  What shall, and what should, become of him?       What do these questions mean for Mexico?
