I mean really why did I have to put of with French for 10 damn years, just think how many wasted hours that is. Another thing I’m going to rant about is the exam. Yes the exam, the destroyer of marks. Have you ever noticed that almost every person that writes an exam does poorly on it? Any ways, I know school is essential to our futures, but come on. Could it be any harder to keep up? First the cut funding, Now they cut of my last year of schooling!?! I just don’t get it…  Well I’m sick of ranting, but you all know I’m right
