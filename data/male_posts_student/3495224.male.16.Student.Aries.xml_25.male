She would trek north heading through Richmond, Wilberforce at lightening speeds. After a long hard trip along the putty road she came to one of her main and favourite waypoints Gyra or Black Mountain. She docked for no more than an hour to let her crew members have a meal break. The crew members were having a great Bacon, Eggs and sausages with toast whilst having a chat with their old mate Billy, who runs the Black Mountain gas station of a night time. The crew were ready to get back on the road and got the old girl running for her next leg on to Glenn Innes which was where she was to dock at 3:00 a.m. to have a long earned rest. The old girl rose to a phone call by Wendy Brown at 8:30 a.m. after which she got her bits and pieces rolling again along the New England Highway. The old girl was running well and before the crewmen Dave      (Captain) and Charlie (Co-pilot) knew it they were docking the old girl in Casino for a late breakfast and a well earned hair cut by the Captain. As the Captain got his haircut, Charlie took the chance to get a bite to eat from the local pie shop. Both Captain and Co-pilot were prepared to get the old girl started again and get back onto the road. At approximately 4:00 p.m. after a long day of driving the old girl found her way to the Sirrus Apartment block in Tweed Heads and gave a huge surprise to MIM (Grandmother) and had a quick chat before starting the old girl up to make her way down south to the Mount Warning Caravan Park which is situated just west of Murwillumbah. The QeIII had done the crew proud and docked at cabin G7 before going to the front office and saying hello to Judy and Bob. After getting the key to G7 we got all our luggage inside of the cabin and got organised to go and have a shower before deciding what to do for dinner. Anyway we got back into the QEIII and departed the caravan park for Murwillumbah. We got some munchies and then we headed back to the caravan park. At this stage it is the 28th December 2003 and we had to wait up for Mum, Heidi and Tip to arrive at the caravan in mum's car. Dad and I decided to watch Open All Hours on his portable DVD player in his room, We watched that for a while and Dad ended up dosing off, I thought I'll go out to my bed and watch the DVD on my own, So i began to watch another chapter of it and I was beginning to fall asleep, So i figured they would still be another hour or so away and I don't feel like staying up, So i turned the DVD player off and fell asleep. At about 2:30 a.m. I was awoken by the arrival of Mum, Heidi and Tip so we sat around talking for a little while to ask how the drive was for them. All was well so we decided to hit the beds again. We were planning to go to Mim's not long after we woke up, which ended up being 10:00 a.m. We all had our showers and breakfast and got into Mum's car and headed out to Tweed Heads.    31 December 2003  The Day of Mim's Birthday, We awoke as early as possible to have breakfast, and have our showers etc. We got organised and headed off to Jan's house where the party was to take place.
