Sure, its kinda useless becuase all you do is get info about different colleges which you could easily get online but thats okay, it's a good excuse for us all to hang out on a school night for two hours. So yeah, be there. You know you wanna see me.   Yup, movie last night was very cool. Me and lauren have this bad habit of acting like we're drunk all the time. That always gets interesting. Think we definitely scared some people. But what kind of night is it if we don't scare anyone, anyway?   Okay, some other people need to start writing stuff in here...me and lauren are totally going to end up having conversations on here if you don't. Dumdedum...anyway guess i should actually pay attention...or start sending random people e-mails. The two are entirely interchangeable at this point.   Rar unto all
