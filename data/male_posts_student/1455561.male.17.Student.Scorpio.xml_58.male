In fact i was fully expecting him to arrive sitting on a piano being pulled by wild dogs through the streets, beating off peasant children with a stick and shouting "when you make an album , then you can touch my piano".  When he did neither of these things i was even more disappointed in him, and this is why i will not be buying his album.
