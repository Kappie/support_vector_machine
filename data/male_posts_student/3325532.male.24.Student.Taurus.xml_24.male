Today I did my weekly volunteer rounds at PMH's CT/MRI clinic. I lvoe watching people's faces light up with joy when they're told that they get to drink their barium sulfate coctail once again (dye that makes the CT image show up better). The flavour on the bottle says Orange. Funny, it looks like milk but has the consistency of chalk mixed with water. Actually that's what it looks like when I make the stuff (one of my jobs). I mix water in these jugs with this nasty white goop. In any case, the flavour is orange, but the only thing that resembles orange is the smell perhaps. The looks I get range from hillarious to pitiful. Some people laugh when I give them the cup (having drunk an entire 2L bottle the night before) while others give me a blank stare and tell me they're rather have chemo than drink that nastiness called Barium juice (yummy sounding too). I make them drink it anyway. It's one of the joys of the job. When told  I  should drink it instead I tell them I'd love to, but I have to make sure to leave enough for them.  Besides that, the volunteer position offers other intangible benefits, such as seeing people put on their hospital gown backwards and watching them walk down the hall with their underwear showing out the back. I mean this is like putting on a bath robe backwards - is it such a hard thing to do? Of course I always end up having to chase them down the hall and inform them that, despite popular belief, hospital staff DO NOT enjoy chasing semi-nude octogenarians down the hall at 9am in the morning. OK, I jest. I do feel sorry for them and don't (usually) let them get that far away. So far I've managed to catch them on time, but it's only a matter of time before one will slip away, and then who knows what will happen.   Then of course are the individuals who are obsessed with their weight. An obsese (to put it lightly) man came in, and, when told to change, managed to somehow put on the SMALLEST gown in our collection. You'd think that when the bottom of the gown only reaches your bellybutton, something is wrong. Perhaps, (and correct me if I'm wrong) but just maybe it's time to move to the adult size. But no, it's not obvious enough. We should label our gowns better next time. Put that in the suggestion box.  And then come the people who just don't want to read. I mean there are these two big doors with two large stop signs and multiple warnings "Do not open these doors", "STOP here!", "Extremely powerful magnetic fields beyond this point, individuals with metal on their person should not proceed". And on and on. Of course, the logical thing to do, according to some people, is, but of course, to open the door and walk down that hall. Why didn't I think of that? Maybe the powerful magnetic fields will invert their brain cells' molecular dipole moments (OK I just had to put some physics in here) and that will miraculously endow them with the power of reading. Actually, I don't understand it. These people are capable of filling out governmental forms that give me the willies just glancing at, yet big red stop signs are 'no comprende'. There's another one for the suggestion box ("re-lable 'stop! do not cross' doors with governmental form jargon").  After all this excitement, I decided to go downstairs to get a coke. I take the sleek glass elevator do the mezzanine, start walking down the hall, and notice some people standing in line. Hmm. How odd, I wonder why they're standing in the middle of the hall. I shrug it off and continue my walk to Tim Horton's. The strange thing is, I notice this line continuing along my route, and everyone in it staring at me as if to say "Why would you actually be  walking  to get to your destination? Wouldn't it be better to stand in line and not get anywhere?". I ignore them. Especially since the line continues far into the distance. So far, in fact, that a thich haze envelopes the poor souls at the far end.  2 miles down the hall, I start getting a creepy feeling up my spine. Where IS this line going to? Could it possibly be... Na, but what if?... I begin thinking that maybe these poor people are in for one heck of a surprise. Some prankster started this line, but actually all it does is loop back upon itself. So the people are just waiting to eventually get back to where they currently are! No, I laugh off the thought, especially since I now see the line's continuation passing out the exit door. Even sillier! Why would these people be waiting in line to get out of the building? Isn't it usually the other way around? As I near my destination, the truth hits me in the face like the inevitable custard pie flying into the politicians face (and while we're at it, let's face it, every politician has a custard pie with his or her name on it, and, sooner or later (but hopefully sooner) it will meet it's destiny and be reunited with it's deserving recepient. (For more information on this fascinating topic, I STRONGLY  STRONGLY  recommend reading the following article at http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/11/23/pie.protest/ it is by far the most enterntaining peice of journalism I have read in a long time)) Now, where was I? Oh yes, the proverbial pie hit me in the face, when I realized that the line did NOT, as I thought, go out the door, but rather doubled back and ended up, believe it (or not, as I did at the time) at Tim Horton's. I was flabbergasted. Could this be? I thought to myself:   1) Could this really be Tim Horton's? 2) Could a line actually be this long? 3) I mean, is it physically possible for a line to be this long? 4) What would Newton say?  5) Could classical mechanics allow for such a length? 6) Failing that, would special relativity correct for this seemingly impossible mobius loop? 7) Failing THAT, would string theory have a solution, or would it necessitate the inclusion of 11 parallel dimensions, an axiom many physicists laud. 7) Speaking of strings. I'm hungry. 8) I wonder what's for dinner? 9) I should call home and get mom to make spaghetti. 10) That reminds me, why am I here? Oh yes, Tim Horton's. I look again in disbelief. All this staring is making me thirsty. But the Tim's Oasis, despite being a mere 5 meters from me, could have just as easily been 5 blocks away. I look around hoplessly. Maybe that nice little old lady will let me bud. "Excuse me, do you think I might be able to....".  NO! . Gee! How rude! I mean she seemed like such a sweet old lady! Besides, how does she know I wasn't going to ask her to borrow a pen or a hanky or something. Humpf. I look around. Everyone is now glaring at me, as if saying "Listen bub, if you so much as dare to even approach me, I will slap you so hard that you'll thank me if I throw a custard pie in your face". I decide to try the puppy-face approach. I stand there making my poor old puppy face, and even feint a tear. Nothing. Eventually the old lady throws me a hanky. Thanks. I look around some more, and who's sure to be the 3rd from the front of the line, but Mr. Hospital-Cloak-backwards. What! How did HE get here? I knew he would slip away, he had that sly look on his face. And now here he is, cloak and all. I decide to brave the line.  When I finally get to the end again, I notice that it looks much like the beginning - stretching far into the distance, but this time the other way. I ask someone "Isn't this the end of the line?" And the frank reply I get is "Listen bub, does this look like the end of the line to you? I've been waiting since 9am. This is the FRONT of the line". If this is the 'front' part of the line, I shudder at how much farther back I have to walk. Three months later, I finally arrived at Tim Horton's. At first I couldn't believe it, but there I was. Really. I wept for joy. After giving me an odd look, the cashier asks, "What would you like sir?" "A coke please," I answer. "I'm sorry, we don't have coke here". Huh? I couldn't understand her. It sounded like "Commont appelle tu, monsier" (for those of you who don't know french this means 'hurry up and make a choice before I serve the next person in line). At this point I didn't care. "Give me a Pepsi, give me a juice, give me a tea, a coffee, a beer, I don't care, just give me something to drink". "I'm sorry sir," she beamed, "but we're closed for lunch now".  Luckily I had a custard pie in my pocket, for just such an occasion.  Stay tuned for tommorrow's adventure.
