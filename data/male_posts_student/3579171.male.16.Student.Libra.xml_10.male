It started out pretty normal, he tester checked the car and tested me on my hand signals.  The car was fine.  I got lucky when guessing the hand signals.  After waiting for the horrendously slow driver in front of me to start his car and get the hell out of my way, I started my car and got the hell out of the person-behind-me's way.  I did ok getting out of the parking lot, didn't hit anything or anybody too hard.  I made a perfect left turn out of the parking lot, only because there was nothing on the street to hit.  Continued straight until a stop sign.  Stopped perfectly.  Made a bunch more perfect turns.  Stayed in my lane.  Did everything I was supposed to do.  So it's pretty obvious what the results are right?  Yup, I failed horrendously.  So your probably wondering, "I you drove so perfectly how in Zues' butthole did you fail?"  It's pretty simple actually, I just suck that much at driving.  I pulled up to this stop sign.  Looked left.  Looked right.  Nothing.  Inched forward.  Looked left.  Looked right.  Nothiing.  Started to turn.  Looked left.  Minivan going 90 right next to me.  Luckly in the impending crash not many people died.  Just the tester, the nun driving the minivan, and the 7 orphans she was driving.  Not bad for my first driving test huh?  Only 9 people dead.  It's ok that failed.  I'll just try harder next time.  Maybe I'll kill less people, who knows?  If you actually believed me when I said I killed 9 people, I feel very sorry for you.  You should just commit suicide now and spare yourself the torment you will receive in the future.  Just kidding.  Actually the exact same thing happened, except there was no crach.  I speed front of the minivan into the left lane saving myself and the tester.  Being an ungrateful bastard, he stilled failed me.  Damned bastard.  I should have just crashed into the damned van.  Anyway, after waking up after passing out from shock, he asked me why I cut in front of the van.  To save your ungrateful ass, you bastard.  Actually that was what I was thinking, but I just said, "I dunno..."  Genius aren't I?  Anyway, I drove back to the DMV, not killing anyone else on the way, and did a pretty nice parking job.  Then he turned his head and looked at me and said, "Ungratefully... good driver...bye."  That exactly what I heard.  I think what he actually said was this, "Ungratefully I can't kill you for almost killing me so I'll just fail you.  You will never be a good driver and should never be allowed in a car.  I hope you burn in hell.  Bye."  I'm almost 100% convinced that's what he said.  I probably wont remember for sure because of my bad memory.  Oh well, I guess we'll never know what he actually said.  Anyway, that was my first driving test.  I'm looking forward to my next driving test!  Wish me luck and pray for the other drivers around me.  - Some loser
