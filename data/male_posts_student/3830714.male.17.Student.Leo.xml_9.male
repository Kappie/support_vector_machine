During this 1 week trip to China, i learnt alot about the local culture, especially how the emperor lived in the past. I also got to try alot of new things which i have never do before, such as riding on the trishaw and making dumplings.   let me show you some of the photos which i have taken.   urlLink    Mr Tan CB at Singapore Changi Ariport's departure hall.   urlLink    Jian yong and i on the SIA plane... on our way to Beijing!   urlLink    Tan CB play poker cards with us!!!
