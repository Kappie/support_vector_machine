And even prouder to follow up saying that it took me two years to read the Tao te Ching, which, in Word, is only thirty two pages long. And proudest to say that I have yet to understand the first poem from the Tao te Ching. (I prefer the Feng/English translation.)  “Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations.”  At first thought, I believed this meant that becoming desire-less allows a person to understand the mysteries of life. “Ah-ha!” I thought, finally. But now, I am beginning to think a little different. Now, I think that when one has cast off all desire, one is enveloped in mystery. One only sees mystery, no answers, no comprehension, just endless mysteries. This is not so bad as it may seem. For all of sudden, life is awe. Everything becomes a mystery waiting to be solved, yet answerless. The sun rises in the morning, why? “Why” becomes honey seething down my lips and into my soul. Why is the answer I have been forever seeking.  Or perhaps not.  Ever desiring. Manifestations. Hmm. Like I said, not even the first poem has formed a stripe on my belt. This does not upset me. I (along with countless others) have thought about the desire to understand. Wanting to know truth, is this not a desire? Wanting to become desire-less, is this not also a desire? Seeking after truth with no anticipation of finding, is this a desire? Or is this simply movement?  Tonight, like last night, I abandoned my usually hermitage for the outside. Very nice. I love people very much, as well as activities. Of course, I also love solitude. Nevertheless, tonight I found myself sitting on well carpeted floor listening to music for “Music Night.” I love the idea of “Music Night.” One can easily guess the goal of “Music Night” is to bring together friends who love music and sit back, listen, talk, and of course, drink beer. My request was to listen to a rare album by the Sugarcubes, Bjork’s earlier band. It was nice to be around people again. For the past two months, I have rarely seen anyone I know. How about another quote from the Tao.  “Oh, I drift like the waves of the sea, Without direction, like the restless wind.”
