I had  planned to get the new Norah Jones CD, however as I was comparing the merit's of Norah Jones soothing voice, Shannon Noll's country themed songs  and The Black Eyed Peas' soon-to-be-3 #1s a lovely lady caught my eye, a lovely lady named Kelis. I pretty much knew I was going to buy that CD, but of course I made myself pretend to evaluate it (listening to it, debating if it was worth taking a chance if it would work with iTunes[wack copy protection]). Of course as soon as I walked out of the store I realised I had been a victim of great  graphic design .  The cover looks a lot better in real life. How awesome is that cover picture. The makeup  brings your eyes stright to her's and then to her lips , which are flourescent pink, which strongly contrast her flourescent white teeth. Everything seems to have a reddish tint to it. This, coupled with the fact that you don't see any clothes on her (suggesting nakedness) creates a  sexy atmosphere . Her eyes, however, are lined a silvery colour with big dark eyelashes which is more innocent than sexy. Her hair fills up the rest of the cover to create interesting texture and push the focus to her face.  "Kelis" is written in a very unique curvey  font  which seems playful, cutting edge and cool at the same time. By placing this ontop of everything it gets pushed to the front. While "Kelis" is made to stand out "Tasty" is practically hidden, its pushed to the back by the use of a simple pinkish red colour for the font, as well as a similar shinyness to it as the rest of the objects on the cover. This with the fact that it seems to be a part of her rather than floating on top of her pushes it so far into the background that it is virtually the last thing you see.    By having her name and her face being the focus, not the album itself it is clear that this release is designed  promote Kelis  to the status of celebrity. This is also shown in her image make over. The last time I remember seeing her she had a multicoloured afro, and now she has a more natural looking hairstyle. She is also going for the sultry sexy look, compared to the playfully loud "I hate you so much right now" look.   On the back of the cover is a  mini poster , just like the one from the Junior Senior CD. It depicts her laying on her side. on a large red reflective suface. Her legs look like they're a kilometer long below an ass that evern Sir-Mix-Alot could (and I'm sure does) love.   Moments later I saw   urlLink Something's Gotta Give  . It wan't bad it was pretty funny, had a bit of a boring middle and definately needed younger actors! *shudders at thought of  urlLink Diane Keaton  almost naked* but overall about a  7/10
