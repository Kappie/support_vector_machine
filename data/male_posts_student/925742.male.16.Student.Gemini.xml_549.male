I Have not done a LICK of biology.  I NEED TO FINISH a chapter every week.  God help me if I don't.  I have to read a lotta pages and do a lotta work tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  I know I can do this, I know it, I just gotta stay home and not go out. Stay away from the computer.  That sorta deal.    I'm getting my haid cut in 15 minutes.  I should probably leave 'n do that.    The lyrics to "I wanna be sedated" come to mind.  Sooo...  let me play it, post the lyrics, and leave.  If you don't know who sings this, you need to be shot.     Twenty-twenty-twenty-four hours to go   I wanna be sedated   Nothing to do, no where to go, oh   I wanna be sedated      Just get me to the airport, put me on a plane   Hurry hurry hurry, before I go insane   I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain   Oh no oh oh oh oh     Just put me in a wheelchair, get me on a plane   Hurry hurry hurry, before I go insane   I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain   Oh no oh oh oh oh     Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show   Hurry hurry hurry, before I go loco   I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes   Oh no oh oh oh oh     Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show   Hurry hurry hurry, before I go loco   I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes   Oh no oh oh oh oh      Ba-ba-baba, baba-ba-baba, I wanna be sedated   Ba-ba-baba, baba-ba-baba, I wanna be sedated   Ba-ba-baba, baba-ba-baba, I wanna be sedated   Ba-ba-baba, baba-ba-baba, I wanna be sedated    WHOOOOOOOO!!!
