This time I'm going to do an exceptional pop-punk band named Fall Out Boy. Quite talented. Very captivating voice. Oh, and I have it on good authority that they are good looking too.  Fall Out Boy was formed in 2001 when Pete Wentz quit his group Arma Angelus and joined up with his friend Joe Trohman and began writing songs for fun. After a while, they stumbled across Patrick Strump who has a very charismatic voice, and thus, the birth of Fall Out Boy. After much trial and error the 3 found a permenant drummer in Andy Hurley. Working out of their hometown of Chicago the group made a name for themselves. Soon after a 3 song demo they collarborated with Project Rocket to make a 2 sided EP. Now record labels from New York to L.A. were watching them, and Fall Out Boy, choose to sign with Fueled By Ramen Records. If you're interested in them i suggest you either visit their website at  urlLink http://www.falloutboyrock.com/home.php . or some of their better songs are Calm Before The Storm, Pretty In Punk and Chicago Is SoTwo Years Ago.   Until My next blog.....keep Reading this one.
