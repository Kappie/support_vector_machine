I want a blog to show my thoughts on things, cause I have a lot! Politics, world news, techie stuff and my family. I chose Blogger because its google, and I for one love google and at a push couldn't live without it!  So anyway, on with today. Wake up at 12 noon. Look at emails, not much there. Ring Kate (my girlfriend) to see what her plan for today is, she's off shopping in Lincoln with her mum and cousins (I live in Blackpool, you do the math). Okay so decide I'm gonna learn ASP .NET because I'm bored with PHP these days and I want something new to play with. But I thought I'd reformat first so I could have an nice clean install of XP to do my coding on. Gets stuck at 43 minutes remaining on the install and that's my day stalled for the moment. Goto bed hoping it will fix itself. Wake up 30 mins later, not fixed itself, my sister, b/f and their daughter (Rachel, Lee, Carlotta) making banging noises down stairs annoying the hell out of me.  Then off to get my other sister and daughter (Helen, Roxy) from Blackpool (I live in St Annes, 2 miles from Bpool). I've got a provisional license so I drive with my dad to get experience. I've just passed my Theory test last week which I'm chuffed with.  World news wise. Handing over Iraq to Iraq.. good idea or not? I'd say no, theres still too much violence going on and personally don't think they will be able to handle it on there own.  Sports news. Started watching the Holland vs Portugal game, saw it was 1 - 0 to Portugal last, I'm routing for Holland though... *checks what final score was (went to get sister)*... 2 - 1 Portugal bah! Oh well, good on you host country!  Currently. Downloading Microsoft Visual Web Developer Express 2005 Beta which is free for now and I was recommended it was good for developing ASP .NET. And I'm about to ring Kate to see how her day went!  Toodles for now
