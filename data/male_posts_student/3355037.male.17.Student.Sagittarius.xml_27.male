So I guess my blog will not become as neglected as I had imagined. The bus ride here was very boring, and yes, Penelope, you were right. We did take a freaking school bus. No charter for the guys. My room is creepy. It's located at the end of a dark hallway. But I don't have to room up with whatshisface though. So that's good. It was odd though. The very first thing that the "guide" said to me was " You are? Okay so your room will be right down the hall. You have about 2 hours of free time until our first meeting. If you could just be there at about a quarter to three, that'd be great." That last line creeped me out because it felt like it had come straight out of Office Space. But anyways, I'm gonna go get my stuff unpacked in my room. Would you look at that alliteration. I'm out.
