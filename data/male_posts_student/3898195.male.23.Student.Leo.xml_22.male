Which I did, I didn't leave the restaurant till 12:48AM (which was ridiculous).  Today I left work way ahead of him, roughly the same amount of time he left me last night before. I didn't mock him about anything, I just said "bye" to him. Sometimes you just can't be too cocky about stuff. I was happy. I could've helped him clean up so he can go home early, but I want to teach him a lesson.  I could've left way earlier but I stayed to ensure the part of my job as an assistant/backup manager was done right.  I don't like being mock by infrequent misfortune and I'm sure none of you likes that neither. I even sometimes makes the same mistake, but it's all a learning process. You just have to think before you say, otherwise bad omens will come back to you.
