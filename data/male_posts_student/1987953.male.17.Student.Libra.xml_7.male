My next post will be something going on in my life that creates a nice topic of discussion for the day. I will also have a Bible passage of the day under my signature everyday. Please be respectful to others, be brief if possible, and please remember it is not a chat room. Otherwise, have fun. This is as much for my friends as it is for me. I will be back several times a day to respond to what I see. Please comment! Anyway, talk to you all later! Tell your friends this is where I am!   In Christ, Mike  "For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God." - 1 Corinthians 1:18 NIV
