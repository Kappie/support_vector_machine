Moberg's back from his vacation, so he got to do the cabling which left me with the updating, which is even more excellent, haha.        I'm really getting the hang of this blogging thing, and I'm liking it a lot more than the stupid livejournal crap, lol. I don't know why I switched to livejournal after starting a blog in the first place. I guess it was because everyone else had a livejournal. Phew, never making that mistake again, lol.        Anyway, I've been slowly making my way through  Catch-22 , even though I start to fall asleep every time I get into it. It's not that it's a boring book; it's actually really kewl. I just can't read for long periods of time when i'm comfortable. Maybe I should like sit in a really uncomfortable chair from now on, while I'm reading. Yeah... that'll be better. lol.        After today, I'll have 12 more days left of work, which is awesome. Also, I'm looking forward to my NYU visit on the 11th, which'll be excellent. All in all, I think the job was a good summer experience... which I'm never gonna do again, lol.
