We could only see half the stars because of clouds, and lightning was increasingly rampant. RAMPANT. There was a cop driving by, and then he stopped and turned around, so we thought he was going to steal our fireworks but he didn't. My hero.   Little did we know . . .   a few minutes after that we were wishing he had stopped us, because it started raining out of nowhere. And it wasn't pansy rain, it was Brazoria County rain, meaning raindrops the size of basketballs. We couldn't see a thing past the water. It was nearly impossible to know if we were headed out to the ocean or about to slam into a dune--the only thing we could see well enough to use as a point of reference was a trashcan, until another car appeared. We asked them how long until another access road, and they told us a couple of miles. The water was rising, and we were in it. Sara's car was repelling the basketballs pretty well, but her tires needed a miracle to . . . not . . . get stuck in the sandy mud. I thought we were going to be washed out to the ocean; the water was probably six inches deep at least in some parts, and it happened pretty instantly. We were trying to find an access road but it was impossible to tell if we were passing them because the rain was so intense. (If we had been on any other road we would have had to stop and pull over to wait out the intensity of the rain, but obviously this was the worst of our options at this point.) I decided we should pray, so we held hands and I prayed out loud that God would make us safe.  Less than ten seconds later , we saw the headlights of a truck on the access road, turned in, and followed the Bluewater Highway towards home.
