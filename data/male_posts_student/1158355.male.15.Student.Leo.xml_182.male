There was this assembly from 3rd to 5th where Kaiser and I talked about band issues the whole time and occasionally Galentucchi would come in with his hilarious things he says. This lady was talking about her people being called tootsies so he said I call my dad tootsie pop and when we dance it's called the tootsie roll. That kept me laughing for 20 minutes or so. They caught Adam and James on camera because we're going to be on "Today's Show" in march or something. Well they kept erotically shooting Adam with their camera. Adam must have been freaked out. I got extra credit for coming to science because half the class never showed up because of the assembly going 40 minutes into the 5th period. Then I had gym. This is when things got weird. We were playing AP Euro Handball, that's what I call it now, and I was passed the ball but Tim R came out of nowhere and deflected it but fell right over me and smacked his face on the ground. It looked like I tripped him and he went to the nurse and now I'm gonna get my ass kicked by him tomorrow, woopie goldberg. But hey, I always have the almighty Zortek, I mean Joe to back me up. He's this awesome senior that's in Black Magic, he's in my gym class. Voodoo on you bitch. Ok so the rest of the day, nothing weird. Drum lessons after school, then I drummed for like 3 hours and didn't even mean too. I mostly practiced with my hands and got my skill back and made it even better than it was before the vacation. Now I'm ultra quicky, Nestle style. YEEEEEHAAAAAAA THAT'S A HUUUUUUUGE BITCH! ANYWAYS, I haven't even started my homework yet and it's almost 8:30 so I'm screwed considering I have a shitload of hw. Ok I'm gonna bounce and juggle around. Bye
