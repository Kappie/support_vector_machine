So, again, I humbly request that we work on importing the music I'd like to own and listen to.  It's only fair that we get the "exotic," is it not?  I discovered this music because my parents kick ass and sent me to Spain for a week.  Ah, Spain.  I love you.  I love "Pasapalabra," Magnum ice cream bars (Empire should bring that home, too), tinto verano...damn, I love everything.  And the place I went- outside Malaga- had a chiringuito with my name on it, literally.  Could there be a clearer sign from God that I ought to be there than to see my name all in blue neon with the word "Bar" in front of it?  I think not.    Nonetheless I'm back in New York.  New York, where the cabbie almost killed me on the way back from the airport by nearly hitting (narrowly missing?) the median on the freeway.  I think the damn city gave me allergies, too, since my first week back I was all sniffly upon exiting the house, which never happened before.  But really, I'm not down with NY right now because it's where I'm obligated to be.  I have to finish this stupid program, get my degree, and run away.  To earn money and pay back my loans.  And all that other stuff that connotes "adulthood" that I'm not totally enthused with at the moment.  Oh- politics.  I almost forgot the politics.  Now there's a "credible" threat for a summer attack in the US.  What bullshit.  Bush is in trouble because our mercenaries (sorry..."Halliburton" and other "corporations" helping us fight wars) are beating the crap out of prisoners, and now there's suddenly a "credible" threat?  Not to mention the uproar over gas prices, and the "American Idol" voting controversies (our priorities are amazing, are they not?- lest you think I think I'm better than you, I'm watching the AI finale right now, not that I like either of the finalists) and it's the PERFECT time for a "credible" threat as a distraction.  Fuck that- I don't believe you, American government.  Especially not you, Democrats.  Y'all always go along with this shit (except Byrd, I wish more politicians were like him...but then, most have careers and futures to think about, and he...he's guarding a legacy)- Republicans almost overthrew Clinton for a blow-job and you've done jack with war for profit.  Just in case- I love Bush, yay Bush.  You're my hero and when I grow up I want to be you (only, y'know, I'll work the empire better than you have- which is your only flaw, don't get me wrong I love you).
