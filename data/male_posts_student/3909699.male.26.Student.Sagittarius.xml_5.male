Here, as Mum warned me yesterday on the way from Taunton station, nothing has changed. I have not been to this house since December 2001, but I feel as though i had never left. Indeed, the change such as it has been, is for the reality to transmogrify into my golden image of the place, since my mother's long-time associate, with whom I never got on, no longer lives here, and thus it is far more stress-free than it actually used to be. This is somewhat mitigated by the disappearance, with him, of wide-screen TV and digital satellite, but otherwise it's blissful. Otherwise though, Somerset in Summer is so beautiful - this morning I woke up in my old bedroom at dawn (due to ongoing jet-lag issues) and opened the window all the way and climbed out and sat on the edge of the water tank, and just looked at the garden - kind of surreal through the sheer dislocation and the tiredness, but still just awesome. I'm a bit stressed that here's not really somewhere i can work, though - and I really do need to get this thesis written (I am informed by Entourage that it is due in 254 days!) That being the  final  draft. . . Another incredible thing in England now, which has enabled me to connect my laptop to the internet for the first time since getting back, is the existence of  free  dial-up internet - apparently with unlimited downloading etc, though I haven't tested that yet.
