I'm not that exited mainly because I've been lacking sleep for the past few days because of my stubborness. I keep playing the guitar before my homework so I usually end up cramming the next day. Another is that I can't cook. We are all required to cook and I fear that I might accidentally set the food I'm cooking on fire. But as far as being excited, I just can't explain it. Is it maybe because of the possibility of something bad happening... or is it something else. Now I'm getting confused...    We had our club a while ago... and for the first time this schoolyear, I actually didn't find it that dreadful... But still, I regret taking violin lessons instead of learning the guitar. I'm enjoying the guitar more than the violin right now. But if I'm to quit right now, I might regret the 5 years I've spent playing the violin. So it's like a double-edged sword- either way, I lose.   Recently, I've been reading this book called "Behind Sad Eyes, The Life of George Harrison". It's kind of weird. After these past few months of being a fan of the Beatles, it's just now that I'm reading the book that I really knew someting about George Harrison. John Lennon was the rebellious kind of guy who was successful even as a solo artist, Paul Mcartney was the sensitive kind of guy, when paired with John Lennon in songwriting were quite the duo. Ringo Starr was the happy-go-lucky guy who would say yes to anything. While George Harrison was the Shy Beatle, the Quiet Beatle or maybe even the Sad Beatle. It was weird for me, he had fame, girls adored him and he was admired all around the world. It's just weird for me.   Well... that's it. I hope whoever is reading found it ok. (but I doubt anyone would read this...)
