We Jews give you Christians so many holidays, and you get to enjoy them while we have to starve and work ourselves to death.  Grrr.  By the way, Yom Kippur's ban on work was one factor for my blog tardiness.  Josh Turner wouldn't accept a pamphlet I got at temple* called "The Jewish Response to Missionaries: Jews for Judaism" because it said all this stuff about how all the Christian citations of Jewish foretelling of Jesus were terribly mistranslated (like "And he sojourned there," was translated as "Christ is our Saviour, Hallelujah!" (but not actually)).  Oh well, whadayagannado?  *Now we go to our old, orthodox temple in Nonantum again, near where we used to live (up until I was two and a half months old).  Our house was across the street from that of the head of the Newton mafia.  We go there now because my dad wants to avoid this woman from his school who goes to the conservative temple we went to.  Last week I applied to this French Exchange Program thing, to go to France for a month in February.  It sounds pretty cool, though I'm not amazing at understanding spoken French; the essay and schlepping for recommendations I had to do were other factors in the blog lateness.  I might not get in despite my obvious excellence, though, because the packet said the Selection Committee "is concerned about students who over-committ themselves," and I'm in three clubs and five honors as it is.  This weekend, myself and the rest of the Tanzania group (including Charlie Mokriski and others) went to South Egremont, MA for a training mission.  We hiked twelve miles in one day with really heavy packs on (we were there for three days total), climbed the highest mountain in Connecticut, cooked our own food, slept in tents, and drank nothing but water (which we had to boil for water bottles and cooking in tiny stoves).  Tiring, and annoying (especially this really aggravating Wilson kid), but alright overall.  I wasn't home Friday, Saturday, and Sunday; this led to a homework crunch and the failure to update my blog.  The last big thing was an essay on Liberia (my assigned country) in history.  We had like three weeks to do it, but I had so much other stuff going on that I did no research, notes, outline, or writing until yesterday (it was due today).  Still, I managed to throw together a fairly long and good paper, supporting the wonderful thesis throughout and stuffed with as many metaphors as I could pack in.  Here's my last sentence (I had mentioned the sword of Damocles earlier in the conclusion: "With every new challenge, a piece of the thread unravels, and so without radical change, it is only a matter of time before the dagger fallsâ€¦"  I was saying that a combination of bad economy and civil war would ruin Liberia throughout the paper.  I've never used an ellipsis at the end of a sentence in an essay before; I think it worked out pretty well.  Sue that, Jackie Childs.  Well, that's it.  Strong Bad was pretty weak, bad this week, with the Cheat e-mail, I thought, on a completely related note.  After the PSAT on Saturday, Jonny, Loren, and I ought to see "Kill Bill."  I'll talk to them in class later about that.  No good quotes in the last few weeks (or as Brian would say, the last coupl'a while).  Instead, I'll end with the latest edition of Conan O'Brien's "Celebrity Secrets," said by Conan and guest Jack Black:  "The Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox will meet in the World Series up in the bleachers where they'll have a great view of the Yankees and Braves."  "The recording artist once named Pink will be called 'Beige' when people realize that that's the color you get when you mix her name with the crap she records."   "Thanks to advances in automation, Nike shoes will be made by robots. Unfortunately, the robots will be made by children in Malaysia."   "We will at last have definitive proof that Jesus is the Son of God when Jesus borrows and wrecks God's Chevy Cavalier."  "A man with a bulge in his crotch will be asked by his girlfriend if he has a banana in his pocket or if he's just happy to see her. In fact, he will both be happy to see her and have a banana in his pocket. From that point on, men with bulges will be asked "Is that a banana in your pocket and/or are you happy to see me?""  "Shoehorns will stop helping feet slide into shoes and start trying to bang the shoes themselves."   "Ancient scrolls will reveal that Noah originally planned on bringing three of each species on his ark; not to save them from the flood but just to see if any of the animals were into that kind of thing."   "California Governor Gary Coleman releases all the inmates from the state penitentiaries in order to be reunited with the cast of Diff'rent Strokes."   "Anna Nicole Smith will team up with the makers of Altoids Mints to introduce their newest flavor, Winter Bacon."   "The line between Hasidic Jews and the Amish will further blur when the Amish start performing Barn Mitzvahs."   "Rumors that Batman and Robin are gay will be confirmed when they legally change their names to Topman and Bottom."   "Bars will serve a popular new drink called Jack Black and Coke. It will be two parts whisky, one part Coke and three parts Whoop Ass, Beatch."
