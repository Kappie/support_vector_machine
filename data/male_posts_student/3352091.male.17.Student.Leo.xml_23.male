My dad and me headed down there wednesday night and i stayed in the dorm rooms for that night and thursday night. And lets see the girl to guy ratio is like 3 to 1 so hell ya. FInally a chance. SPeaking of girls its easy as hell to get some girls number down there. I got more numbers from girls in two days at an orientation than i got all through high school. The class advisers sucked, its like they had no clue what the fuck they were doing, So i went to mark landis' office (head of theatre dept) and declared my major as theatre and he helped me with my schedule. well im gone.
