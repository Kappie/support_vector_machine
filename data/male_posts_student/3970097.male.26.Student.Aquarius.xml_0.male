I must admit that I was kinda distracted by few thoughts and events which took place in my life, and one can understand what really happens when they call themselves back? How would i like to rate it? Well, I dont know. There were good things as well as the bad things, but then again, bad things had more time then the good things during this july. I survived in a terrible car crash, the worst of its kind in my whole life. Thanks to Allah, he gave me a new life. Then had few relatives deaths in the family, few were of course terrible, as the person was either too young or too innocent to die but I guess thats life. We are just so unaware of the next moment. By the way, I want to apologize for the last time, I left the whole talk in the middle without putting an end to it. I hope I will be able to complete that someday. Wishing you all a happy August and hoping to keep the best amongst us.
