In Karin Wilkins' Developing Communications course (387C; Fall 2002 UT-Austin), the following question was posed:  "What is the role of Journalism?  What are Journalists striving for?"  The class was slient.  I hate silence in class; the uncomfortable looks shot from person to person, watching as each student tries with all gusto to avoid the professor's glare; a venerable feast of Corey McMullin face ensues often.  So I spoke:     I think that while the role of Journalism depends on the community which it comes from (Journalism requires a readership to follow it; that readership is community, whether it be a small town or a number of people who surf the web), but it is always striving for the essence of Truth.   At the time, I stood strong with my argument.  I knew Journalism, better than most everyone in the class.  I spent the first 17 years of my life training to become a journalist.  I've worked at four distinct papers in my life, bringing each one to a higher level of success in writing and readership.  While I no longer enjoy much about the field, I know what the field is about.    So the responses to my answer shocked me.  At least four people in the classroom vehemently disagreed with my assessment of the higher calling of journalists.  Yes, journalists were byproducts of the community, but that meant that community biases would be precedent in their words; in no way could journalists ever meet the idea of Truth, unless we consider Truth to be truth.  Only in Western Journalism, specifically America, do people believe that journalists live in a bubble of unbias, where they can ignore their personal feelings and the feelings of their communities to report the Truth of the day.  It makes more sense to believe that journalists serve their community, and in serving it carry out the biases and opinions of that community.  It's not a grand conspiracy led by political parties and oil barons, it's just how people are.  We like to be led.  The idea of a caste system in India was introduced by a conquering nation 1200 BCE, and it's stuck for the past 3000 years.  The concept of Hell was introduced by the Zorastran religion in 400-600 CE.  These things still remain around because someone who presents themselves as an authority says them.    Moral of the day - George Bush doesn't deserve blind trust.  Neither does Tom Broakaw.  Or the person who wrote the above link.  Cultural Studies father Stuart Hall has  urlLink a few things to say about this .   UPDATE  - More  urlLink good reading , this time from ESPN Page 2's Ralph Wiley, regarding the basketball player who turns from the flag during the National Anthem at basketball games.  You can love the country and love its freedoms, but that doesn't have to mean you like or support its foreign policies, and that doesn't mean you can't speak out against them.
