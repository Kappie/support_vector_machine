It's kind of like in baseball, when a pitcher's throwing a no-hitter, you're not supposed to mention it to him, because you don't want to get the hurler out of his groove. Men are weird like that.  THE COMMITMENT FACTOR Most men realize that once the love thing is out there, he's in there for the long haul. Most men also realize it would be karmically heinous to declare your love, then bail two weeks later.  THE SCARE-AWAY FACTOR What if you tell her you love her, and she runs out of the room screaming? Worse yet, what if she keeps running? Say, to Istanbul? Ouch.  THE OPENING-YOUR-HEART FACTOR This is especially applicable if it's your first love. You can't quibble with this one, because leaving your heart unprotected — especially if you've never done it before — is truly frightening.   THE RECIPROCATION FACTOR There aren't many worse feelings than telling your honey you love her, and her coming back with something like, "That's sweet. Thank you." Ugh.  THE SCREWING-UP-THE-DELIVERY FACTOR What if you stutter over the word love? What if you call her by the wrong name? What if you say, "I love glue"? Any one of these could kill a relationship. Any two of them could scar you for life.  THE SCREWING-UP-THE-WHOLE-DAMN-THING FACTOR What if you're trembling so badly that you spill red wine on her white blouse? What if you choose a restaurant filled with screaming kids? What if you pee your pants? If she's a cool chick, she'll overlook all that, but nonetheless, it's all ugly stuff.  THE RECIPROCATION FACTOR, PART 2 She might tell you she loves you too — which is nerve-wracking, because it's been said that getting exactly what you ask for is daunting. But remain undaunted, gentleman, because — to reiterate Babs's on-target observation — love is soft as an easy chair. And more often than not, an easy chair is the world's most comfortable place to be.
