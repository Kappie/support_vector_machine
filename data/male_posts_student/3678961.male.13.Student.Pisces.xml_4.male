And he wouldn't stop asking me questions. He was playing DBZ: Budokai for my GCN in the morning, and I was still trying to sleep. The conversation went like this:  (Name Deleted): Hey, Dylan! Does this game have any codes? Me: No. (5 minutes later after almost getting to sleep) (Name Deleted): Are you sure? Me: Yes! (Name Deleted): Because a game like this has to have codes! Me: It doesn't, now let me get back to sleep.  And he laughs at the stupidest things, almost wetting himself (seriously) in the process. Oh, and I can't forget the ENORMOUS surprise he left in the toilet for me (I thought everybody knew to flush; but then again, this thing was massive, and literally shaped like a banana). Thank god he's leaving July 2nd.  In short, I hate morons. The only reason why I had him over was to get the $35 I mentioned yesterday. Plus, he never stops calling me. Man, I need to get caller ID.
