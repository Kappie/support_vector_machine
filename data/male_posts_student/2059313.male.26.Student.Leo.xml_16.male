       
      I have been, shall we say, inspired, to begin making entries.  Here is a place and opportunity to jot down my thoughts and feelings and possibly events that occur in my life, or the life of others to stop them from banging around in my head and put them into some sort of physicallity to relieve stress or tension; to shout the praises of people, events, or things; to release energy of excitement, elation, happiness, anger, frustration.  To those of you who get to read this... it's the inner workings of my mind, a scary journey, if you ask me.... oh, and try not to wipe your feet on my medula oblongata... thanks.
