If I was ever to become a preacher/pastor I would be sure to speak like he does.  Almost the perfect, balance of humor with message.  I got so many things from the messages this week.  The fact that the prodical son's brother was worse than he was is probably the first time i've heard that.  In many ways of my life I was letting little sins that didn't in fact seem real to me continue.  They were minimized in my thought, and the Holy Spirit helped me to see that.  To show how much complaining I had been doing,  I caught myself (complaining) 5 times the rest of that actual day!  Spiritual Emphasis week is great guys!  There should be at least 3 of these each year.  It was a great time to come together as a school (which I love so much), and become closer to Christ.  I truly mean that.  The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will
