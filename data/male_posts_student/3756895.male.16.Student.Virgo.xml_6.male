I'm so fuking touched. What a pair of best friends to have. But I've got a feeling that they went to SRJC was with the intention of seeing pretty and sexy chix. =(   Anyway, they were waiting at the canteen when I finished my lessons and was on my way to meet them. Man,I can see all eyes turning towards them, especially the girls. Prolly because they were in home clothes, not their looks. =X Well, after having lunch in the canteen, I kinda showed both of them ard the sch. Then we reached near LT5 when I introduced the 'PCC Room' to them. And we took a pic of SC using Darius's phone :       It's pretty lame but it was some funny shet. Lol. After the tour ard my sch, we started to make our way to the jamming studio to JAM ~ Ian was there waiting for us when we reached. Lol. He skipped sch today. =/ Bad boy. It's the wrong thing to do, man.  After jamming, we went to eat ROTI PRATA. Whle eating Roti Prata, we watched the video that Darius, teh fcuking great videoman, took of us jamming... 40+ mins including the video-ing of the ij chix. Not good. ;(   Then SC, Darius and I took cab home. Reached home at 6pm before going to cut my hair. Met E-lynn(nfi who she was at first), Fiona and Aud Ee. Man, seeing the 'chix' all in one day is too much for me. ^^ Coolness. Now my hair can spike. No more long hair to irritate my eyes. Lol. Reached home at about 7.15pm, ate my dinner and slept till 10pm. Chatting wif SC and Darius now. Ciao.   Darius: Remember, this Sat, we'll see whether you've got your balls back. ;)  SC: Darius was pretty serious when he said about the Sat thingy. Well, I guess we better choose good looking chix to see whether he found his balls.^.^  Both: See you guys on Sat. Gonna be fun. Let's watch 'i, robot'. gg
