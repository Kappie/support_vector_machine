I was so beat after that hike.  And this afternoon, I went rock-climbing.....on actual rocks...in the woods!!  I climbed the 20 ft. cliff twice and the 30 ft. cliff once....it was so exhilarating!  I felt so empowered.  I want to do it again.  There is good talk of a Climbing Club next year.....more to come later....ask me about my week....I have to go.
