A young child when asked by a parent how much he loves them is always - i love you "this" much as he stretches his hands as far apart from each other as is humanly possible - is it possible that this mannerism - was predestinated to be used as a reminder to those who look for it - the undending love of God for you and i.   I ws just reading    The Purpose Driven Life    in a chapter about the love of God and came to my own conclusions based on watching children, and remembering how much i used to say i loved my parents - I love you "this" much
