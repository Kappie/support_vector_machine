Is that such a bad thing? I don't know. I know I'm misconcieved and everything but I really think, at this present moment, that I'm looking GOOD. Tomorrow I'll look ugly again. I looked ugly earlier. Just right now, I think I'm fairly attractive. Prove me wrong.  Read everyone's blogs. My Dad is scaring me in the way that he seems to take the fact that I'm busy as a personal insult. If he gave a damn he'd know that the reason I'm busy is because I LOVE being a trombonist. I totally adore being a bloke so many groups depend on. I'm an attention-seeker. And I'm bloody proud of it.  Drawing ever-closer to the CAYO tour. YAY, BELGIUM!  Love, Jon Roskilly
