Well, the reviews were definitely right on this one; it was an extremely good movie and a welcome change from last week. If you've seen the original (I haven't), it supposedly changes quite a bit of stuff up (such as who is running for office, etc.). No complaints from me though, and it's definitely one of my recommended movies of the summer.
