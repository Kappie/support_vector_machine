Both are good, but Spiderman 2 is so damn addicting, and even though its kinda glitchy its so fun it doesnt matter. You get this intense sense of gratification in saving people too. 4.5/5 Mutant Spiders. (cant give a glitchy game a perfect scre no matter how fun it is)  Megaman, The game are fun but very hard, Ive betean some of the robot bosses but stil its hard and diffucult too. Hte games are good though even the old original Nintendo ones (which are all but 2 of them btw). 4/5 Charge Shots.
