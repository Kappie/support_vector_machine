After that I came home and cleaned out my car because it needed to be done. Went to the movies with Steph and afterwards we went to the mall and I got some snazzy new swag. Got two shirts and a pair of shorts at Old Navy and then went to Electronics Boutique where I got Harvest Moon for GBA and then to Hot Topic where I got a John Deere shirt and a new watch. I was just about out of money at that point so we just headed over to Steph's so she could show me all her neat stuff. At about 8 we went to Pat's to go swimming and then we got cold so we went inside and I got ignored for a couple hours. Big suprise there. I'm cool with it, though, happens all the time. Just about everywhere I go with more than one other person, I get left out. I guess I can't do much about it. I think it's in other people's nature to just ignore me unless they want something. So I'm sitting here trying to think of something to do, and I realized that I haven't updated my blog in a while, and since today was sooooo amusing I figured I'd dump some of my shit thoughts in here. I wrote a song too. Yay. It's called The Sun Goes Down. Enjoy the First Draft.  I'm so sick of pretending That I'm not what I am Tired of feeling Nothing like I truely am The world thinks im not who I really am Free, light, not distant from all we are  And it all falls apart After he sun goes down I lose myself When the sun goes down I can't keep control And in the end, the sun goes down  When im out there I look like anyone else Happy, normal, independent But when I'm not in the open The real me comes out  And it all falls apart After he sun goes down I lose myself When the sun goes down I can't keep control And in the end, the sun goes down  The sun goes down On me, on you, on everything we know I get lost in the darkness No one to help me get out Of this prison I am locked up in  And it all falls apart After he sun goes down I lose myself When the sun goes down I can't keep control And in the end, the sun goes down  And it all falls apart After he sun goes down I lose myself When the sun goes down I can't keep control And in the end, the sun goes down  (The Sun goes down...)
