I swear, once you get your helmet, you feel big bad and fucking awsome. You big now, you can grab a hammer and start nailing your helmet and wont feel a thing. Its the part that we all love. ITS A HELMET!!!!1 Then the pads are like bullet proof armor (atleast hte shoulderpads), its the things that go smash! really, now i can run into robert and wont feel a thing. Its the part we need the most. Then we got those tight pants and all the lower torso gear like thigh, knee, hip and ass pads. Thats the stuff no one cares about that stuff go bash. But without it, we couldn't have the smash bash boom going on. those are some of the important things ever. I just cant wait till we get the offical jersey, once we get that and get on the line of skrimage down by a touch down at our 20 with 2 min to go, fans cheering, cheerleaders stripping (i wish), thats i swear thats the time where you feel you can do the impossible, be supperman, spiderman, wonderwoman(maybe) all at the same time. I swear thats the best part of football, that and the smell of hotdogs in the stands.   That was a week ago, i'm too lazy to update stuff anymore, doing to much i'm not supperman yet....haha cheesy siperman movie quote....*cough*....  I saw spiderman 2 last wensday, I swear I KNEW THE 3RD MOVIE IS GOING TO BE BOUT HARRY.......kinda obviouse if you watched the cartoons. But i cant wait to see the 2 gliders cause harry uses the same small one and then another bigass one that could hook on the the small one. Really this is something big. Oh yea if any1 finds kristin(sp) dunst nude, please tell me.....*cough*  Ha me and liz wer talkin earlier bout cars/trucks (wowi'm impressedshe knows her stuff or just likes all the good cars and trucks), but we got to the subject that she was going to drive to summit store with her mum. I wanted to say how i drive and everything, almost did but i shall only tell close friends. If you really wanna know, ask Jordan, he saw, he's proof of what i've done....cant really explain me on HW17, but i'll get proof of that somehow too, everything is proove it proove it prooooove it. Stupid stupid stuuuupid. Now i hope my grandparents screw that 87 honda acord for a honda pilot, i need a new feel...still learning clutch when me mum aint around....damnit y wont my mum just start teaching me now....i hate learning myself....  Oh and also when we wer on the topic of cars, i said hell i'll just draw what i want......ummm, i am a nerd, cause i will.   Tomorrow i'm going to paint the table thats on our deck. Its metal btw, and will soon be a green rather than its rusty white. I'll show yall before and after pics. We also painting a wooden bench too, so this'll be fun.   Then maybe next week we'll cut a tree we think will fall on the house if it snows like it did 3 years ago. it'll be hard cause my grandpa will cut it and i'm suppose to pull it while its falling cause if i dont i could damage the roof alittle. Thank god i can run normally with tires tiedfrom my back in football.
