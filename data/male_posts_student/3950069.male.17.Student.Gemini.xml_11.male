You give me chances to be who i really am, and you have a lot of patience when it comes to dealing with me. I know i can be unapproachable and mean sometimes, but thanks for giving me chances and being so nice to me. You say I've changed you and helped you, well you've done the same for me, bro, and i really need to thank you for that. I'm sorry i don't reply to your sms-es most of the time, and i can be a total ditz when it comes to music boxes (remember how i thought you meant those thingys which you store CDs in, haha) but i try my very best to be a good ol' sista for you 'cos you treat me so damn well. Anyways you deserve my first-class treatment! heh :) All the best to you and Xiao Wei. "         --something Kesh wrote about me.    I just had dinner *yay* I was so hungry and I had two rolls of Po Piah. I wonder if its just me, but i've been reading about certain things in the past; what happened with my friends in jan, last year, things people and friends have written for me on Friendster, and yup, that little piece written by Kesh. Some how, I feel indebted to her. Its nothing very big really, but in a way, she used to be the sister i never had(i was never that close to my sisters in the past), someone I really looked up to. I feel nostalgic (: I still have the poem, she wrote for me back when we were Sec 3, "an angel for you" *sigh and smile*    I miss secondary school, well a little, I miss my friends. Kesh whom I haven't seen for ages even though we're not that close anymore, my little own bunch; Sakinah, Delfina, Nuha, Suffian(my brother) Ana my sis and Diyana. Or even people like Sky, Daniel, Kai sheng and Kang wei. 3F'03 and 4F'04, our official Lit class rocked ;) man, I even miss Mdm Effendi.    I have done a little soul searching, and it isn't that I don't know what I want, but somehow...time just passes so quickly now, I feel lost.    I met my darling early this morning for breakfast (: right before she left for project, and I saw her for a little while too yesterday before I sent her home. Sigh, i wish i had more time. But every moment spent, is a part of me that I will always cherish. I miss her, it doesn't feel good, when I see you having to walk away from me, that I can only look at you from afar. You looked so beautiful this morning, I just felt this lovely charm all around you floating through my soul :)    Xiaowei, when you called me Justin yesterday, my heart skipped a beat. I know i once told you not to call me by my name, even before we got together, yet, the reason was because it made me feel really special to you, however strange it may seem. Sharing a little hug with you on the bus, was amazing. I'm so, so hoping that i'm gonna be with you soon. Do you even know how much I miss you baby?    I had a talk with my eldest sis this afternoon, and I'm sad. Yet again, its because of my 2nd sis. How much more trouble does she want to cause? She's taking slimming pills, and she had about 16 panadol pills in her bag. Its a dilemma really, because me and my sis, don't know whether to inform our parents about this, yet...we don't want to cause them anymore worries. But if anything happens, which I pray not, we'll be responsible for not telling our parents when we had actually known. Sigh. I've never known my 2nd sis to be one who'd take pills, I just didn't believe it when my eldest sis told me.    I feel pathetic. Even though my eldest sis studies psychology and writes into the papers frequently, and I myself, aspire to be a psychologist, we're unable to solve a problem in our family. I've heard it from so many directions, every family has their very own problems. I know we're not alone, but, its been years, when will it stop? When can i stop getting in-between, its hurting me. I pains my heart so much, when my parents are upset and worried, yet I've been such a disappointment to myself, and everyone elsewho believes in me.    Time passes so quickly, i'm already 17, and i've received the letter to register for NS. I know i can ask for defererment as i'm still currently studying in Singapore, but 3 years will soon pass, and with another 2 in NS. I know certain things will change, but i'm hoping, really hoping, things do actually change for the better.    Some how, it feels good talking about marriage, about future careers and our lives. I know i'm growing up, talking about 'adult matters', and discussing important topics like the happenings in Singapore or overseas.    Xiaowei, in you, I believe i've found my life partner, my best friend, my confidante, soul mate and my wife. I know that you'll always be here for me, like i've always been for you, I wish I had the words to tell you how much you've actually given me.    I'm dreaming;  of being able to cook for someone so lovely every moring, every night  of being the fillial son  of graduating with aDiploma and furtheringmy studies in University  of having a secure career with a wonderful family of 2 kids  of spending all the time I have possible with you in my arms.      !__if only dreams would come true, I'd be so blessed.
