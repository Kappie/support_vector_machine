I am not playing a trick on you.  #1:  HLS Squash Club  Do you eat squash or want to learn?  The cafeteria has seven kinds of squash ready to eat, perfect during the long, cold winter.  The HLS Squash Club provides an informal group of people who love squash, and we gather monthly to eat it.  There are no dues, meetings, or squash-eating experience requirements.  Eaters of all ability levels are welcomed.    #2:  Sexual Politics of Meat Slide Show Sponsored by Student Animal Legal Defense Fund (SALDF)  What do sexism, racism, homophobia, and speciesism have to do with each other? Everything! Don't miss Carol J. Adams's amazing slide show that, among other things, documents how our culture sexualizes animals and animalizes women in order to facilitate our consumption of them both.   #3:  Twister Conference Kick-Off Meeting Sponsored by Harvard Twister Society   The Twister Conference is a two-day event held every February that is the largest Twister event in North America and  attracts more than 1,000 attendees every year.  Perks of participation include exposure to the latest versions of Twister (including the new glow-in-the-dark board with its own built-in smoke machine, contact with the heads of the Twister Corporation, and a chance to meet people from the business school with a similar interest in Twister. Dinner  will be served.   UPDATE: The real one is #2.  Seriously.
