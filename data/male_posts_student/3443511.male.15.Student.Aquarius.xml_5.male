This is the first time i actually asked a girl out...they usually ask me out...  My hearts thumping, what is she going to say..??  All right, make fun of me if you want for writing poems.  But, my poems are awesome..so shut up.  There not like normal people's poems.  There all about suicide, death, etc.  I made the poem a while back, this girl, isn't like me at all, so i kind of edited it a little bit.  Trying to be as sincere as possible.  Writing a poem sincere, when your me, is fricken hard!!!  Anyways, i get up and (same thing i do every morning when i have about 20 minutes to get ready) i eat some cereal.  Now, if you don't like cereal, your crazy..  Then, of course, i get on my bus for the 45 minute bus ride.  Yes, you heard right, 45 long-ass minutes on a bus..  At that time on the bus, my idol is the person who made the c.d. player...  My heart thumps harder and harder the closer i get to the school.          Anyways, when i get there (being the chicken-shit that i am) i gave the note to one of my friends to give this girl (like i'm going to tell you who..).  When i saw my friend again, she said that the girl said it was sweet, but (why is there always a but...) the more she got into it, it scared her. I was thinking in my head (dammit, i can't be sincere, it's too hard).  I guess, we all have something that we can't get rid off, it's always a part of us, and for me, it's the darkness inside.  Of course, i signed it annonymous, *phew*...  Now, this girl that i don't know said i was sweet, if i told her who i was, she would probably be like, this dude's scary...so, smart mind says....anonnymous...         I went home trying to think as hard as i could about what was scary in the note...came up with nothing..  Oh well, there's only 3 days left of school anyways...  I went on the internet, and learned a lot..  Mostly Javascript, PHP, and some other crap.  I learned some pretty fun stuff that i could pull of at my school on Monday...lol.  Yeah, leave all the messages you want..  Tell me what i should've done, etc.  Whatever...         ~Only as a band of poets, can we achieve what we want~
