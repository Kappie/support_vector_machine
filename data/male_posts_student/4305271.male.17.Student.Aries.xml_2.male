No matter where we go, no matter where we hide thoes issues will always come back. Some people would say that these are all just a test for when we are older, but who knows, it seems they get exponentialy harder as you get older. This seems to be turnig out more like a Online Journal than a Blog but such is life. Well i just hope that slowly things will get back to some resembelance of order, if that is possible, tempers will run high and emotions will run deep but things just seem to always turn out, no matter what. Lets just hope this time it is no different.   TJT
