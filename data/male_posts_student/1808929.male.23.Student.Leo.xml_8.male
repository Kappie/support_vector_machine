I kept a journal for about 3 years until I was 20, at which point I became a psycho pre-med f*ck-up and stopped putting my thoughts in writing. Now I'm a f*cked-up first-year medical student in a whole new city, with a whole new set of peers and a whole new set of issues.       Tomorrow is my 23rd birthday. I think it's Blink-182 that said "nobody loves you when you're 23," so I'm not expecting much. However, maybe this blog can help capture in words some of the huge changes that I've been through in the last 4 months, not to mention my new med school experiences. Ok, this'll do for an intro. Have fun reading, though I can't promise that it'll be spellbinding material. I lead a pretty low key life most of the time. Later.
