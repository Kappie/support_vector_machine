I think that Kyle guy should have to wear a bell, I can almost time my watch by him showing up at the wrong moment. My patience is far from infinite and these days it seems to be wearing thin. Life is far too complicated... I shall have to consider how to simplify it for myself.  That's it for today, nice and short. My bed beckons to me with open arms... I go into nights deep embrace.
