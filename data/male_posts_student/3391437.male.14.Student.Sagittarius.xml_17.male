Calculators are used to carry out some of the everyday mathematical calculations. For example, cashiers use calculator to find the sum of their hostâ€™s expenses. In our society, when a child is about four years old we send them to school. There our children learn how to write, speak and much more. One of the things they learn is math. Math is a science (or group of related sciences) dealing with the logic of quantity and shape and arrangement. Math problems are solved much quickly by using calculator. Many believe calculator is not a good way of solving problems but I disagree. In my opinion calculators are the pieces of technology ever built.
