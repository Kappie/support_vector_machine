How come all you teacher types think she's got to be read? It's just going to encourage her..."  but before i begin, i'd like to say that this is not, i repeat, not a poetry blog   MY life closed twice before its close;   It yet remains to see If Immortality unveil   A third event to me,  So huge, so hopeless to conceive,   As these that twice befell. Parting is all we know of heaven,   And all we need of hell.  this is one of my favorite e.d. poems.  what i love about it is the quiet rhythm that almost lulls me, every time i read it, into thinking that it is a very simple poem with a simple sentiment.  Right up through the 4th line, i think that the poem is nothing special, it sounds like a talented teenager talking about being rejected by the popular kids at school.  But that fifth line really does it for me.  I love the way those words feel in my mouth, almost like chewing.  and i like the idea that love and loss are so hopelessly intertwined that the poem can't offer the one without the other.    Is she the best poet ever? the endpoint of poetry?  of course not, but i think she's an important voice in the history of american poetry, and, perhaps more importantly, I like her a lot, and since i get to pick what i teach this semester, she makes the cut.  Phhhbbbttt!
