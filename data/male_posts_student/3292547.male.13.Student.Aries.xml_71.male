It was better really than the 1st (You guessed it  urlLink Shrek ).    After we got done. We stopped by Wal-Mart to pick up cat food. Cat food. One thing. We left with cat food, a car seat cover (2 really), new fishing line, fishing hooks, a fillet knife,  and  the next 3 books in    The Wheel of Time  series. It took me a bit to find the 8th book. I decided to go ahead and get the 9th and 10th. I kept looking even though I had already looked and happened to find it behind a book the wasn't were it was supposed to be anyway.    So, once I get done with the 7th (I'm on page 287 out of 855), I'll start in on the 8th book; The Path of Daggers.
