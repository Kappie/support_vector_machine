Christmas is just 35 minutes away and he has already made like 100 bucks or so.  Tyke's cousins and aunt and uncle from South Cove came up along with his aunt and uncle who live in Spokane/a houseboat in Seattle.  It was good to just not have to think about anything at all other than just looking smart in front of all of the smart people in his family.  But basically it was good for Tyke to not think about his former situation and to realize that it really is not as important or as pressing of an issue as he could make it out to be.  Sure it is difficult but of course he will be fine with a little bit of time.  And now he is better.  Not perfect but he is at least finding that there is a little bit of humor in it all.  Well, sorta.  But as great as she is, she is not the one.  So he picks himself up, dusts himself off, and moves on to the next lady.  Which will probably not be until college.  High school/middle school/elementary school weren't the right place for Tyke to meet a girl so college should be.  At least it should be.  Tyke's taking another dive.  Let's hope he finds some water somewhere.  Once again, a Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.  Happy holidays all!
