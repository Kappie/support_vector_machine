Go-Karts and cameras, who would have thought they don't go together?  Damn you, Jimmy.  So, the fire.  Last night, I was in my new apartment, lounging in the bedroom.  It was about 11:30.  Carissa was over, and we were just chatting.  Suddenly, my roommate started banging on the door.  I felt a wave of irritation: roommate, intruding at 11:30 at night, this doesn't bode well.  I started to answer, and he just thrust his head right in.  Bastard, I thought.  "There's a fire in the apartment next door," he said.  Aha!  Redemption for the roommate.  I leapt out of bed and dashed into the living room.  There was smoke pouring in off the balcony.  "Shit," I said.  He told me to go outside and take a look -- and I did.  There was smoke, tinted with orange flames, billowing off the next door balcony.  This was not good.  I walked back inside, remarkably calm, and went to the front door.  I checked to see if the doorknob was hot (I've seen that in movies).  It wasn't, so I opened the door.  The hallway had smoke in it, but there was no sign of fire, and no heat.  I went back inside, barged into my bedroom, and yelled at Carissa: "Get up!"  She was already up and dressed, and a bit irritated at my presumption --  "Do you think, if there's a fire, that I'm not going to get up?", she asked.  "Well, we have to go," I said.  I grabbed my backpack and headed for the door.  "Don't you want to take your wallet, too?" she asked.  "Yes," I said, and grabbed my wallet, keys, and cell phone.  Then I headed back for the door.  It was then that the fire alarm began to blare.  An unearthly Spanish-accented voice intruded over the siren: "There is a fire in the building.  Everyone must leave.  Please, everyone exit the building."  Backpack and wifebeater on, I headed for the front door, ready to guide my roommate and girlfriend to safety.  A new voice came on over the alarm: "This is not an emergency, I repeat, this is not an emergency.  There is no fire.  Some people on the 25th floor were having a barbecue on the balcony.  There is no emergency."  We all started to laugh.  Security was already outside, interrogating our next door neighbors.  And we were safe.  The fire alarm continued, intermittently, late into the night.  My roommate was the one who pulled the fire alarm, by the way.  I think it was entirely justified: however, I do not view this as a good public relations move, vis-a-vis our next door neighbors.
