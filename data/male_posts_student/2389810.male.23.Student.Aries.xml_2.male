I went with a putrid orange color (hope it doesn't bring back bad memories Zhang - jk) with tons of texture.  Life is dirty, life is messy, and it can suck (e.g. my volley!)...but there are also beautiful things embedded in the chaos (see if you can see them).  I of course noted 'life' to continue the theme, but brought up 'love' as a new addition.  All in all, everything is "worth preserving."  If you want the full-res image (and not the just larger version that you get you clicking the image above) try  urlLink here  [note: 1.89MB].  urlLink
