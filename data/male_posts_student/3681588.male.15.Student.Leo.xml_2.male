My first thought was that the guy had forgotten to turn off the emergency generator (and I was not going to remind him to after I entered ;) ). My brother kept telling me there was electricity; this was hard to believe, but when I woke up (still with my A/C on :D ) I asked my mom and surprisingly there was electricity!. THANKS MR. PRESIDENT FOR A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP!!! :p
