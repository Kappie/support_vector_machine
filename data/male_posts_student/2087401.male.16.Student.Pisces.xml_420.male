Thomas, you may remove the hat of shame and replace it with your trendy new hat, but keep it handy in case it ever becomes needed again.  The hat shall become the voice of justice for the chaotic crime-ridden blog! Or something.  On to match-ups.  Last we had a super intelligent toothpick vs Alex Trebeck's hair in a world domination competition.  We never could have imagined they'd join forces to create the ultimate evil.  So the next match will be James bond, equipped only with Thomas's new hat and my new vest, vs the Axis of Evil (the toothpick and the hair)  Should be interesting.  And about this vest.  I just purchased it at Goodwill and it is, in Layman's terms, cultural syncretism. (Just my little LN joke) Seriously in layman's terms, it is simply hideous.  Orange, green, and red plaid with cylindrical wooden buttons.  It will go perfectly with my purple shirt.  BTW, Erin: Thank you for reading my story.  As a fellow writer of fiction, your opinion means much to me, the whole ass thing aside.   That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!
