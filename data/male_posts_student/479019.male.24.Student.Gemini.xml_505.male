I was sort of wandering around feeling kind of shitty, but then I found an apartment in a run down building... and there was someone... a certain someone that made me feel good in that dream. No... not what you're thinking, but rather it simply made me not alone in the post-apocalypitic world. However, then someone else came into the picture and reminded me that she's not available. Kind of a drag of a dream. It's been a while since I've had a dream with her in it... and dreams with her in it always seem to result in negativity. Hopefully I won't have another in a long time.  Speaking of other negativity, my laptop is once again not starting up. Fucking Best Buy better fix it this time.  **
