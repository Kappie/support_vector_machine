It really was incredible, and they didn't even make her a finalist. I wanted to rough them up in the parking lot. I mean, if Becca really doesn't represent what Junior Miss stands for then the program is bunk. That's right, bunk. Looking at the other girls, I got the feeling that Becca just isn't fake enough for that sort of thing. She's entirely too genuine to fit their sickening mold: poise and current events and all that crap. It's like training to  pretend  to care about things without caring at all. It's like they want these girls to be able to appear perfect, whether they are or not. If that's what you call being 'proper,' I think people are better off being savages. I think that in actuality, Becca is too good for Junior Miss. And I mean it. I don't have much respect left for the program, really. So die, Junior Miss. The program ... not the girl.
