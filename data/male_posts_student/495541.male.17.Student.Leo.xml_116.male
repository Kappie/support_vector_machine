I played 3 games.  Lakers are 3-0 in franchise mode so far.  I average almost 50 points a game with Kobe.  I can drive the lane and dunk at will.  The only problem is my defense.  Shooting in the game is so good, it's crazy.  It's easy to nail a jumper with a hand in the face.  The rest of the day I sat in my room and ripped my CD collection onto the laptop.  No internet connection up there so I had to type in all the CD track names and album titles.  It was a good time waster.  I screwed up how I wanted the file names to be thought.  It goes Artist\Album\TrackName.mp3  What I wanted it to be like was Artist\Album\TrackNumber - Artist - TrackName.mp3  Oh well!  Anyways I'm still partially sick.  I've got those eye drops from the doctor.  They seem to be working.  My eyes don't look as blood-shot as the other day.  I still have 2 other perscriptions to take.  I don't know if they're working.  I can't really tell.  I feel better but I have the same symptoms.  Runny nose, that nasty cough and mostly fatigue.  I'm alright to do stuff now I think.  I don't care how I feel on Monday.  I'm going to go to school and to pratice.  I can't be out that long.  And as I'm finishing up here playing pool on Yahoo with Whitney.  Always fun.  I must go to be now though.  Night.
