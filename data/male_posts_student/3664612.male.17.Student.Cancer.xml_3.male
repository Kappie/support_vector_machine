Well, im not the type to get upset by something so small, so ill tell you what I did today. After school I had to go to the dentist. I hate the dentist, its just how they put all these machine and stuff into your mouth. Plus I had a bad experience at the dentist. Well everything went alright, no cavities. My teeth are just perfect, but im grinding in my sleep. It seems that I grind in my sleep and it wears down my 2 canine teeth, and if I don't stop then I would had to wear this protection thingy when I sleep. Beside the dentist appointment this day was as usual.  Now ill update the euro cup. The final match for the top eight is tonight, and hopefully the Netherlands can win and the Czech Republic beat the German's. My bet is that England will beat Portugal and Greece will beat France. Oh shite I got an oral tomorrow, better start cracking. later days
