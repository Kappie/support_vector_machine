I guess it was more bracing and dramatic this time, even about the Peter Parker-Mary Jane ka-chuchuhan.  It still had the "wise words" like last time, like Uncle Ben telling Peter that with great power comes great responsibility.  This time, it was something like doing what's right, even if you think it's not what you want or if doing it is gonna take you away from what you want or wanna do. It was touching, the part when Peter's aunt was telling him about how there is in each of us a hero.. and how despite all of Peter's revelations to her, she still loved him,  and that she was finally able to move on after her beloved Ben's passing away.  And about what MJ did at the end of the movie, it was just so bold.. didn't expect her to do it until  the last minute.  It was a fabulous performace .. it was definitely deeper than the first one, communciating heroism.. dreams.. love.. choices.  And oh oh oh, James Franco was handsome.. kinda hunk-ish I guess.. (tsk) and he looked smart..sassy..chic in his character in the movie, though it's such a tragic thing about his complicated friendship with Peter.  But anyway, I'm glad we watched it tonight, 'had a splendid time.
