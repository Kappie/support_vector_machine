Everyday, the extent of my boss' cluelessness continually shocks and amazes me.  Being talked to by them is like having an enormous, highly pressurized horizontal stream of acidic shit shot into my face, filling every orifice of my face with steaming feces. At least hot girlz haz been talking to me as of late. Yay for interesting, hot asian girls!
