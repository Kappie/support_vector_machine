Saturday 2.00pm    The evil Samsung vibrates with "Anna Home" shining into my eyes.  "Hewwo my little gorgeous German, what's up?" "I have a dilemma - I need some help" "Sure what's up?" "Well (in a vulnerable considerate voice), could you for a start not keep calling me German please, I'm not even fully German, only 3 quarters, you know that" "I'll take it into consideration; anyway, what  really  bothering you my dear" About ten seconds worth of awkward silence followed, eventually with it being broken by - "Jade's stuck in Marseilles with no money - can she have 140 euros from  your  debit card Mat, you'd be really helping her out." "Well I don't have a debit card for a start" "Well can you get your Dads, and like not let him know?" My eyes begin to roll and my lips start a long drawn out "PFFFF" down the phone to her to say "you know I can't do that, or lend her 140 euros anyway, it's her fault she's got herself into that situation anyway; anyho, do you want to go clubbing tonight? "Sure!"  So we did.  Up on arriving at Highbury and Isslington,  had a drunken hobo keep calling me fat Matty Matty fat, to which people really just wanted to there and then spit at this parasite of society, and so I stumped a menthol cigarette into his hand, which felt devilishly fabulous. Then me Anna, Fluffy, and  the guy who lived above the station at Highbury and Isslington  went to Slimelight and clubbed it hard electronic Goth style hard for 9 hours straight.  Anyway *giggles to himself* beside that most of the night sped by as I mixed the industrial and dark wave room and Monsters inc, in the cinema hall, which even, at my great fucked stage of the night, was pretty fucking cool damn it.  I've really missed the days of trying to sneak into that place at 14, through the back door, without the security noticing. It's really got better in the last few years, and for once, I felt at home with a cute guy near me, a non-judgmental/remotely townie crowd surrounding that with me in my old Goth clothes, cherished immensely.  I guess I feel quite sentimental at this moment, so I guess I must, If I don't ay it enough that I love you Anna so much, no matter how much I tease you or come of so weird, I could just hold you in my arms until sunrise everyday I was alive hehe.   Anyway, I was knackered by 7:30, so I headed back for a 2 hour journey to home . . .  Only to get ready for a 6 HOUR DRAG AT WORK, where Becky sniffed out my fatigue as soon as her fat arse walked through the automatic doors and made sure, with much more precision than usual, to punish with an ECOH warning (each customer offered help bullshit/PC thing i.e pointless, pathetic pompus notion) and to which, she stressed, meant that if I received a further two, I would have to be re-trained; (most probably by her no less) which (she forgets) would be the easiest 4 hours paid work of my life. Stupid bitch. xBuBzx
