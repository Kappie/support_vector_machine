Iw as one of the supporters, and i had to be at the competiotion, giving my support. Edwin was sitting beside me, and we were cut off from the rest of the Chinese High boys. But no matter. wats the difference, i thought.      Then the rest of the supporters starting pouring in. One by school by another came in, taking their seats. Nanyang was behind us, NanHua was in front.      I noticed this girl sitting in front of me, quite pretty.(Yes this is what the post is about) She had her hair tied back, and i saw blue earrings on her ear lobes. Very pretty.       Wished i could have her contact... wished for a phone to take her pohoto. Oh well... too bad... Next stop, getting a phone to do waht i wanan do!!!
