Anyways I attended a beautiful wedding this weekend....my classmate Carmen married her longtime boyfriend Stephen.....they had a really nice reception at a place in Atlanta called Villa Christina....watching those two, truly in love ALMOST got me to change my mind about never getting married....almost....  I went clubbing on Saturday night in the ATL....I don't have to dance at all to have fun in the club....I like people watching....folks do the wildest stuff in the club as if they are in total isolation....I just grab a Hen and Coke in one hand and a Heineken in the other and post up....very rarely I will dance with some extra cute girl but I can't really dance so whatever....  Everyone seems to have an opinion on the BET awards....well I stayed far away from those beezos.....I really could care less about that mockery of my culture....but that's just me....I have been Cita/Hits free for going on 3 months now and I feel better way down in my soul....  I was supposed to go to New Orleans for the 4th....but instead I am going to spend the actual 4th with my dad (shoulda been the plan all along) and then go to Mom's family reunion in Greensboro, NC....the last time I had a great time....I'm looking forward to seeing old familiar faces....  They moved the NY party to a Friday evening, thereby making it impossible for me to go logistically....I still want to head up that way someday this summer....I am kind of hesitant to hang with my one friend up there cuz his girlfriend is possibly the craziest female I've ever met, so I'm gonna need this OTHER PERSON to still be there....that will be the deciding factor.....  Anyways that's enough blogging for now...gotta show my face a few places and pay a few bills....
