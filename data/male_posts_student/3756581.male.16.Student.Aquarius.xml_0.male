My heart and prayers go out to him and his family in this time of need and trouble. I suggest that everyone who belongs so any faith, pray for this man, and his safety.   How many more heads do we have to see? How many more innocent men and women have to die before we realize that we are up against PURE EVIL? These Terrorists...not Muslims, TERRORISTS...are lower then scum, they do not even deserve to breath the same air as me, or you, they are the bottom of the barrel that is humanity.
