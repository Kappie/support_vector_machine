The Top Twenty Rock Songs: #1-5   1)  Cream - White Room   The very first thing that struck me after listening to this song was the intricate rhythm pattern. Ginger Baker is arguably one of the top notch drummers in blues rock, and his inventive percussion highlights the song's unique 5/4 time signature. White Room was compressed from an 8-page poem to a single page of lyrics and was supposedly inspired by Jimi Hendrix, who himself was a big fan of Cream. Jack Bruce's soaring vocals, Eric Clapton's wah-wah guitar and Felix Pappalardi's viola work provide the ideal accompaniment.  2)  Cream - As You Said   This is a very off-beat Cream song, a band known more for being rock's first supergroup. Cream blended typical delta blues to psychedelic rock but still managed to create a unique sound of their own. They released four groundbreaking albums in just two years and made an enormous impact on rock n' roll. Their wildly adventurous music is reflected in this song. Wonderful acoustic piece, this is. The surprise element is the cello, used as the base. Jack Bruce was asked to play the acoustic guitar by Clapton himself, much to the embarassment of Bruce.  3)  Fleetwood Mac - Gold Dust Woman   If you haven't heard the album Rumours by Fleetwood Mac, from which I've picked this (as well as the next) song, you haven't heard one of THE all-time Classic Rock essentials. The Macs, a hugely talented bunch of musicians, were never quite stable, never quite united as a band, always in sort of a disarray. Love affairs between Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, the McVies (John and Christine), and the constant differences of opinion between individual band members actually brought out the best in terms of their song writing and compositions. I am not (and was never) a fan of love songs as such, but the Macs are very very different. They never indulged in a slap-stick style, always penned mature stuff. This particular song is written and sung by Stevie (for Lindsey) --  "Lousy lovers - pick their prey, but they never cry out loud...Rulers make bad lovers, you better put your kingdom up for sale.."  -- great lyrics, these, and a lovely bass guitar to go with. Brings out all her pain after she broke with Lindsey. Stevie Nicks was not only sexy, but I think she also had the best female rock voice once upon a time, during the 70s-80s. Always known to wear black costumes during live performances, she had a mystical aura about her. I am a big fan of Stevie!  4)  Fleetwood Mac - Never Going Back Again   Lindsey Buckingham is/was no doubt a hugely under-rated guitarist. There are very few well-known rock guitarists who play an electric guitar primarily with fingers (fingerstyle). Mark Knopfler, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Robbie Krieger, Chet Atkins, Duane Allman...Lindsey is one of them. This particular song is strictly acoustic though. In fact, if you want to hear a two-minute fingerstyle acoustic guitar masterpiece, then don't look any yonder. This time, it is Lindsey's time to write a song on Stevie (very good writing, again) and showcase some amazing guitar fireworks. The song is in a dropped-D tuning. The only thing that lets me down is the song length - just two minutes!  5)  Fleetwood Mac - Bleed To Love Her   Another example of Lindsey's talent not only on the guitar but also on the vocals. I don't think this one is particularly easy to sing as well as play! What a fantastic chord progression. Nothing more to say. Give it a hear!    urlLink Part II: Songs #6-10...
