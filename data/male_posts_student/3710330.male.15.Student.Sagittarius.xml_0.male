"This is an absolute haven..." said my father in a tone I swore he had last used when he stared at awe at how gargantuan the Casino in Genting Highlands was.      "For gamblers..." I muttered, under my breath.      After a rocky and tumultuous trip over the ocean(which wasn't much of a joy ride, but rather a plane ride constantly repeating the loop the loop), we disembarked from the ferry whose smell of people retching had started to permeate the reception counter of the ship. We had our passports checked and followed the line of heads to the next level. Our parents led us to the arcade before scrambling for the Casino on board, after receiving disappointing news of there not being a cybercafe for my sister and I to dwell in. The arcade seemed very dilapitated to me, for it had gaming machines which had missing joysticks and buttons, screens that constantly indulged itself in the sea of blackness. The area was immersed in total darkness, only with the constant flashing of lights from the screens of the gaming machines. There were no windows, and was was a box room of not very large size. It gave me a sense of claustrophobia, and everytime the boat seemed to rock or move, my stomach would start churning and spew up bile. This sensation made me feel terrible and I decided to degrade myself to playing the mindless games at the arcade so as to overwhelm the effects of my sea sickness.        Dinner was served at five thirty, with an eat-all-you-can buffet. Tantalising smells were already emanated from the dining hall when we approached the corridor leading to the dining hall.My stomach was rumbling and was speculating on how secreting hydrochloric acid now or later would differ. We rushed to queue up at the table which had the main courses of rice, fried noodles, braised chicken with cashew nut, Lamb slices in a soury sauce, Stir-fried vegetables and oven-baked prawns. I took a portion of all the delicacies and piled it up high with food, for I was starving and the food seemed...'heavenly'. We found an empty table which had a stretch of red velvet sofa seat for on one side and mahagony armchairs with seats of cushion embroidered with flowers.  I tucked into my food and ate heartily for the food was simply...delicious! Half way into the meal, the ship started rumbling and the unused knife was trembling precariously over the edge of the table. I wondered whether it resulted from the movement of the ship and decided to look out of the window. The sea was peaceful and calm, no signs of a disturbance in the waters. The rumbling had started to get worse. tables had started to tremble, people were having difficulty walking with plates of hot food, and the tall hot water container emitted sounds of metal clanking and water splashing. Wild thoughts started flashing through my mind as   I endeavoured in my futile attempt to remain calm. Perhaps a cataclysmic earthquake had hit our ship? Or perhaps the ship was being ravaged by a giant squid? Could it be a hijack by perpetrators? I felt myself suddenly perforated with holes with blood gushing out of the round neat wounds on my chest, feeling the intense pain seering through my mind. And suddenly, I was awaken from my nightmare by a prod on the shoulder by the waiter asking whether to clear my food. The rumblings had stopped and everything had returned to normal, only with a few waiters rushing to clean up a few spills. The waiters were ostensibly being calm and going about their normal routines. Or perhaps, I was just being paranoid... Well, this tremulous meal, at least satiated the hunger I had for the past few hours. We ended the meal in a taste buds wetting,mind freshing drink of melon soup(or is that what its called?).       After dinner it was back to the usual routine.(I was hoping  we could return earlier) I settled down on a game where you just have to keep on pressing the button and you'll win. The sea sickness was getting to me again and I nearly felt like retching.          At eight thirty, the announcement for the ferry to depart came    and my parents fetched us from the arcade, to board the ferry,The Ocean Raider. It was a ride that left me in shambles, rocking me from side to side, upsetting the still digesting stomach of mine, and causing great disturbance to the mind that was trying to desist the manifestation of dizziness.      Upon reaching Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, I heaved a heavy sigh of relief and swore not to venture on a ship again.
