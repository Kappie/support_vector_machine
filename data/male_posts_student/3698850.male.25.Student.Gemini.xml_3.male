That’s why we hear so much about voter apathy and indifference in the United States and how horrible it is that people don’t exercise their right to have a say in political affairs.  Once this sorry situation has been identified, media, business and the like begin a campaign to motivate the population to head for the polls as often as possible so as to support one or another candidate that is acceptable to the current power establishment.  As long as you are “involved” in the system in this way, you will be encouraged to believe that you are fulfilling your duty to your country, yourself and your fellow man by expressing your ideas and opinions about which self proclaimed intelligent and capable person that represents the same basic interests should be in charge of directing policy.  However, if one were to be so crazy as to seek organization outside of the major political organizations and attempt to have more direct control over the decisions that shape his or her life, control that might undermine elite domination, one would discover that the flood of encouragement quickly diminishes and eventually devolves into pressure aimed at forcing a return to the previously prescribed modes of behavior.  The illusion of participation through ballot casting is meant to coax the citizenry into perceiving that they do influence the direction that they and their nation are moving in meaningful ways, through nothing more than choosing between nearly identical (more or less) white, wealthy males who obviously don’t conduct their business with the general good in mind.  This mirage is strengthened in no small part by lack of discussion in any mainstream arena addressing possible alternatives for public influence on governmental activity.
