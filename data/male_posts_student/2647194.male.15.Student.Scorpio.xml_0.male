I'm talented at rambling on and on about one subject, so I guess that helped.  Well, I bought 3 more Mirrodin booster packs today, and I got a Broodstar-wasn't that fun. I guess I'm at a slight loss for words today, most likely because I used up all of my thoughts on last night's entry, there was no Spanish today for random funnies, and because I've covered most of everything I usually talk about. I don't really have any homework tonight to procrastinate from doing, so that's fun.  I've run out of things to say for now, and I don't feel like writing anyhow.
