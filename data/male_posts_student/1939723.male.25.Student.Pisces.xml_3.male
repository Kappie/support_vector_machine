Not possible because your program is running in a sandbox. Want to communicate via Bluetooth with other mobile phones? Only possible with supported phones, which are mostly very pricy :(    I don't want to flame Java ME for this. But I tought, that after all theses years of development and inventions, it would be more integrated with todays available technologies. Unfortunately I'm mistaken. As long as I have to use the development kits for specific modells to access the full functionality, Java ME won't be interesting to me.  One of the most interesting aspects of Java is, that you can run it on a variety of devices and platforms. But most interesting features are simple not present in the mainstream.    For now, I'll turn my back to Java ME. But I'll have a look at it's future development. Let's see how much consumer devices and their abilities will improve.
