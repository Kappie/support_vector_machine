Nobody really cares about me anymore and they all want to talk to Lloyd, and I can understand why, cause he makes them laugh and that, I'm a little jealous I guess. Double PE was absolutly horrible, always is. Heather and Lloyd were talking amoungst themselves 99% of the time and I was stuck with Arron Tickner, who's a total twat. He was really pising me off. Launch was when my day dramaticly improved, I was in youth club, I had heather to one side and Arron and Gemma to the other. I mentioned if anyone had seen Sex On TV last night. Gemma and Arron both said they had, and gemma said about the gay rimming bit. I turned to face her put my hand up to the side of my mouth, and said, in the gayest way imaginable, "I liked that bit". She burst out laughing, and I caught Katie shaking her head at me. That pissed me off a little. Anyway, at the end of lunch, we were walkin down to the D area, I got lumbered with Katie again. I finally said something to her, and she said "Oh, you are talking to me then". When we arrived at the D block, she said she really wanted to kick me in the balls and stuff. Then she suggested that she didn't believe I was gay, and said it was a phase. I told her I liked men and I didn't like women sexually. That I'd know for ages. But, she still wasn't convinced. In tutor Ellie sat down and said, what have you got on your face. I came right out, and said foundation. She asked why, I said it covers my imperfections ad spots and stuff. She then went on to ask me why Katie and I broke up, I though she might know and was trying to get it out of me. When Amy sat down as well, they where kinda both wanting to know why. I leaned in towards them, and said I don't want everybody to know about this, so keep it to yourselves. I'm Gay. They sat back smiling, not saying anything. Then Ellie put her hand out and shook mine and said well done. Then she said, nah lets have a hug. So we hugged accross the table. Amy remained silent and I said to her, please say something. Then Lara came in and said, atleast now we can all talk about boys and make up and stuff. Then Amy asked who I fancied, I said Dean, Justin. Ellie agreed about Dean, but no of them really liked Justin, cause he's so full of himself. Once Amy had a few minutes to think she was fine about it. It felt so good, deffinatly one of the highlights of the week. I can't wait for the prom now. Now Amy nad Ellie know, I'll be able to talk to them about fit guys as well. I was hoping to go to Lara's afterparty, it would be so great, talking about men and all, but I'm not sure I can go, apperently, her parents have said only eight can go, and it's full. I've texted her, in the hope she can make an exception but I wont hold my breath, I should have sorted this a while ago.
