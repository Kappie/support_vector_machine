Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism But we still got terrorists here livin' In the USA, the big CIA The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK But if you only have love for your own race Then you only leave space to discriminate And to discriminate only generates hate And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah Badness is what you demonstrate And that's exactly how anger works and operates You gotta have love just to set it straight Take control of your mind and meditate Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all  We can't keep policing the globe like this... every day, some pissed off whacko takes a pot shot at our soldiers or blows himself up. I dunno... every day, these type of people are proving that we're not as strong as we once thought we were.
