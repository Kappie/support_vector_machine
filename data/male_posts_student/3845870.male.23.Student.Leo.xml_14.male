My own little web page upon which I can let loose the bile and vitriolic rage I have for this godforsaken world. heeeeeem  *takes deep breath* Ok so maybe thats a bit over the top. If anyone was wondering, the reason I finally got off my ass and decided to create this page is that I am procrastinating my University work. Oh and maybe I was inspired by a friend of mine whose level of coolth exceeds mine in so many different ways. She's sexy as all hell too. And she maintains a blog of her own, which is a lot better than mine. You can find her  urlLink here.   She's the one on the right.
