He tells the guy to blow a breath into a breathalyzer.  ''I can't do that, officer.''  ''Why not?''  ''Because I'm an asthmatic. I could get an asthma attack if I blow into that tube.''  ''Okay, we'll just get a urine sample down at the station.''  ''Can't do that either, officer.''  ''Why not?''  ''Because I'm a diabetic. I could get low blood sugar if I pee in a cup.''  ''Alright, we could get a blood sample.''  ''Can't do that either, officer.''  ''Why not?''  ''Because I'm a hemophiliac. If I give blood I could die.''  ''Fine then, just walk this white line.''  ''Can't do that either, officer.''  ''Why not?''  ''Because I'm drunk.''                 Lemme add another line:        “The very fact that I’m admitting ‘I’m drunk’ shows that I’m really drunk”                 For me, I never got wasted before. Admittedly I was disorientated before, but I can still think. Speaking of alcohol, most people can remember me by “Purple John”, “Long John Purple” or God forbid “Barney”. Really, I seem to have a nasty reaction to alcohol. I don’t know if it’s an allergy, but it’s a real pain in the ass. Surprisingly, I have never got drunk before no matter how much I drink.         To Justin. Don’t spread word that I had hit on my mum while I was wasted. Don’t believe that (both the fact that I hit on my mum and I was ever wasted). Jonathan can testify. Justin, you probably would go fuck ANYTHING with a skirt when   ur   drunk. So don’t be lecturing me, go lecture   Leon  , the guy who would fuck ANYTHING REMOTELY having 4 limbs and a hole, including chairs, even when he is SOBER.                      Anyway, alcohol isn’t only the substance I’m allergic to. I am also suddenly allergic, or “intolerant” of lactose, a component of cheese (I’m a big fan of cheese). It’s such a bloody waste I can’t eat cheese or dairy products now. It started with the Meiji pasteurized milk incident. Man! What a load of crap. It’s shitty torture when you suddenly can’t eat things that you like.
