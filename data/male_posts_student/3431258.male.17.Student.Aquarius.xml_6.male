That was so funny, we downloaded a new map called city. 2 skyscrapper and 1 house in the middle. I wanted to use the barret for the first time, that was hilarious. He was flying in the sky like a bird, and immediatly felt down in blood. Yay for advanced weaponry!   Just a quick update to say i had crazy fun for an hour. Anyone reading this should try  Soldat , completely crazy!   My arm itch, i don't know why...  Regards,  Zephyr
