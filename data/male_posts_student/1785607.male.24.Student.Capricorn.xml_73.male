We all have private issues we don't wish to share, dear Capricorn, but this situation affects you. Your intuition will probably tell you who this person is. Try to get them to open up without exerting pressure. In addition, unfinished tasks and chores could be driving you crazy. You may try to run through them like a steamroller, which can cause too much stress. Get the most crucial done, and let the others go. Tonight: relax with a movie.     I mean, duh! ... But four months later.
