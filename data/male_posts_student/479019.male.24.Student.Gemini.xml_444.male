Something about fear of bad yogurt contaminating my smoothie and another one with sex with someone who I would prefer not to think about in that way. Ok well maybe I wouldn't mind thinking about her that way, but my rational mind tells me that's a bad route to go down.  Ok yesterday was kind of a lazy day. I guess it had to do with the nast snowy weather. My plan for today is class at 2:50 and then study in the library afterwards.  Listing to some  Propagandhi  right now... yesterday's class reminded me of "And We Thought Nation-States Were A Good Idea."  ***
