Please!" and we drove around with that and showed people. after we got tired with that we took the sign into the mall, haha thats where the fun began.  apparently carrying around a paper bag with words on it is considered disturbing the peace. The mall pigs were not to happy, they said we were causing a disturbance and stores were calling the pigs on us saying we were bothering them. But thats not true everyone said our sign was funny and cool, people even came out of their stores to look at it. So the pigs took away our sign and me being a smart ass debated with them, shane stepped in every so often as well. Me and the pig argued about how he thought the paper bag was a disturbance and i how i knew it wasnt. We also aruged about how you can wear shirts that say "show me your boobs" in the mall but for some reason you cannot carry around a bag that says "we are bored, wanna hang out. please". So me and the pig aruged for at least 25 min. he was saying things like "i have already told you 50 times that you need to leave" and i responded with a smart ass comment like "ummm no sir you have only told us 10 times, remember, ive been counting" it was very fun. but then he said he was going to call the real police on us and have us arrested haha yeah i would like to see how that would hold up in court. "Your honor these children were walking around the mall with a paper bag, i think they should be arrrested" "Is that all? why thats the stupidest thing i have ever heard, case dismissed"  We also met some cool girls from whitewater on the strip tonight. Hurray! we have made new friends!
