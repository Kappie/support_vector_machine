That's right, folks! A brand new, reality-based game show (two television fads in one!) that pits the one half of conscientious, minding-my-own-business, trying-to-finish-a-paper students against the other half of "Hey-baby-wussup," "Okay-I'll-meet-you-in-the-computer-lab," "DON'T CALL ME NOW, I'M IN THE LIBRARY!" students. The game is easy. Listen to all the different cell phones going off (phones-to-minute ratio: 1:4), and try to guess 1) What song is incessantly blurting out of it 2) Where that noise is coming from, anyway 3) Will someone please answer it?! before losing your cool. Remember, cell phones are not allowed in the library facilities. But don't lose your cool, or you lose the game!
