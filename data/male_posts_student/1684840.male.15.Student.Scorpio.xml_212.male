Absolutely cannot wait until tomorrow because me and my mates are going to Alton Towers for the day, yes, just my mates    Anyway, Food was hilarious - as in stupid.  French was hilariously long and stupid, Mrs. Bladon wasn't in and we had this funny substitute teacher with a shiny velvet coat.  English and Maths were average.  Dinnertime was mental.  Michaela and Annie had an argument, started by Kayla as usual.  She just can't get over the fact Sam doesn't want her back, so she takes it out on Annie.  I can't imagine what Sam's going through    The rest of the day was ok.  We had two spoons teaching rounders, but it was funny anyway.  Biology was a suprise.  We have now started our coursework, which I think is a bit close to the holidays, but anyway.  There were a few laughs in that lesson but I'm not going to elaborate on them.  Becky blatently attacked me on MSN because aparantly I have been bitching about stuff she has said in her blog.  When I'm sure I have done such a thing, I will apologise  , but until I do such a thing, she can go and have her little tantrum.    Anyway, gotta go, planning to do   Tomorrow is going to be GREAT!
