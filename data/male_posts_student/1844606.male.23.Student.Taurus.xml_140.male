Researching online, I realized the place had some rare Sabbath and Ozzy, and only a day or two later, it seems as though someone has bougt the aforementioned items.    I'm itching to listen to these Wilco Demos.  Speaking of, the band finished their "EP" and some songs are pretty solid.  Though I'm biased, my brother really has to take credit for how much he fixed things up.  The process of eq-ing the tracks and getting levels proper with varying vocals was quite the challenge.  I've got about a week left back at home and beginning to be unable to be around my father.  Questions (nearly all meaningless) are constantly fired, if only to be broken up by ranting about random topics or yelling at someone.  Fantastic stuff.
