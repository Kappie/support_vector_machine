I got up oviously, oh and then went out to breakfast at the cracker barrel and got my normal, the all you can eat biscuts and gravy, but i never eat the gravy i just put butter and jelly on the biscuts and eat about 9 biscuts. But after that what did I do? I really can't remember at all. Oh I think I did a whole lot of nothing! I sat at home and did nothing, I believe, but maybe I didn't. This is hard I shouldn't wait this long to write. Sunday is totally lost in my mind. If you remember what I did, which I would feel really sad about myself if you did, post it in a comment. Wait! I came home after breakfast and did nothing. And then Andrew and Amanda and Whiteny walked over like at 3:00, and we walked to Andrew's for a little, and then he had to do something, so we left and went to Whitney's and played basketball. I had to leave around 3:30 though because I was going to a movie with KLT and Haley. They were picking me up at 3:50. So they came and picked me up, and we got to the movie theater and we saw someone who made us laugh. It was Jeff Zuckerman. Well if any of you know Zuckerman you know that he is just... yeah, Zuckerman. But we saw him and then, we went to see the Notebook. Very good movie. For a love story and from a guys point of view, great story and great movie. The actors were awesome, the guy was a phenomial actor, and the girl, who was the same person from mean girls, was also very good and very pretty. I didn't cry but I hear alot of guys cry at the end of the movie, KLT was crying at so many points. But I when that movie comes out on DVD I'm gonna buy it. It's just very good, go see it. But then after that, I got home. And then after that I went over and visited Amanda at her house. Then after that, I came home and did I don't know, on to Monday. I got up, went to school, and then came home. My dad left for a buisness trip at like 6 in the morning, and then my mom got called in. So after all that I had to wait for my mom to get home. And then I rode up to Walmart and then stoped at Kyles for awhile and visited him because he can't get out much anymore. Then around 5:00 I went home and then I think I went and visited Amanda again, and then I had to go. And then her, Natlie, and Whitney walked over to my house and we talked for awhlie. And then I went inside and started my homework. Wait, in between that I went to Haley's really quickly and we did something for a friend. Then after all that I started on my homework, and then talked to KLT on the phone till around 11:45, and then finally went to bed. Then I got up today, went to school oviously, and had an easy day in school. On our break there was this cracker with ants all over it. It was really nasty, their was so many of them. Someone started to block there pathway though lol, it was cool. But school was really easy, and then after that, I was giving Kyle a ride home and my mom said Mrs. Riedel called and I could have a computer from St. Pat's that they didn't need anymore. So me and Kyle went there and we got the computer. Thank you Mrs. Riedel! I got to see Mrs. Campbell again to which was really cool, she was my 6th grade teacher and by far my favorite at St. Pats. But I got my computer, and then went and took Kyle home. Then I set up my computer and then went to Brimfield with my mom and sister. We went to my cousins to go swimming and pick up my brother because he spent the night there. Well I rode the gator for a long time and went a lot of places. And finished one of my goals. And then I went swimming, and then rode the gator again. And then we had to leave around 3:30. But it was nice to spend the afternoon out there. They have a heated in ground pool and they live out in the middle of the country. I love it, it's so peaceful, surrounded by cornfields, I loved it. The weather was awesome a nice breeze and around 80. Oh, I want to live there. But then we left and I had a metting for Student Council, we picked our shirts, thankfully Mike picked the good one. Sorry to all you girls out there that liked the camo, it was nasty. And Mr. Sanders is leaving! He took a job in Morton! He was the coolest teacher/advisor ever. He let us do almost whatever we wanted and he treated us like we were equal to him and like we were his friends. It was very nice, it makes you get past the teacher thing and actually lets you get to know the person. So I'll miss you Mr. Sanders! But then after that, I came home and then watched a little Summerland, and then Amanda called and told me to go up to the soccerfields. So I went and her, my buddy Andrew, Amy, Kacy, and Natelie, and Brian but only for a little. We stayed and talked for a long time, and then Angela Gotchal came, along with some of her friends and two kids from Metamora. Well one of the kids was my age, and they were buff and could kick my butt any day. Even the one who was a year younger than me. So I was just a little intimdated. But they were cool, and we all talked for awhlie. But one got out of his consitution test because he told the wresling coach he was going to be in wresling, so the coach just gave him an A without him taking it. Only in Metamora can that happen, sports over everything, especially football you little steroid driven punks! Wait to harsh, those two kids were cool, so they don't take steroids but everyone else from Metamora does! Evil little metamorons! Oh well back to my day, after that we all had to go home, so I rode Amanda home and then I came home and it's taken like 45 minutes to write this. I'm very off task. I have my US Consitution test tomorrow for APS becuase you have to take it in high school again, isn't 8th grade enough? But I'm not gonna study because it should be easy, they have to make it so people who arn't educated pass it. So why study, if I fail its my fault. Oh well. I'm really tired though, and I have to much stuff to do. Tomororw I have to mow the lawn, I almost did it tonight at 9:45, I was tempted, but the grass was wet. So oviously that doesn't work. But oh well. So remind me to mow the grass. Well I'm tired and this is long enough. So good night!
