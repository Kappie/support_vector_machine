Anyway, what else would you guys like to discuss?  How do you view grades? Personally, I used to really want high marks. I had a lot of experiences during my freshman year in college wherein I've cried my eyes out for what I would consider a low mark. But as of now, I don't particularly care as long as I pass. It's a bit blase in terms of attitude but I'd like to think that I'm a better student now in spite of somewhat average grades than I was before. I can even interact with my classmates better. I know I'm not doing bad in school because I still top the exams and contests but in terms of grades, I am merely average. It all depends on what exactly is your point in going to college, right? I merely want to learn.
