Chris D on Vocals...  Eric and I have had a "band for a couple years now, guitarists  and vocalists have given us problems the entire time, but we have a good feeling about Mr. JP on guitar and hoping for goodthings from Chris.  As of now we have not written any complete songs, Eric and I have thrown around some ideas, but bass and drums don't make the best songs...  Eric had the genious idea to add a bagpipe... I love the idea, What do you think? Well, now you know Untitled, look out for us at any high school concerts. We don't have much of a set music style, but we like bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Blink 182, Metallica, Led Zepplin, Rush, and many others...  Untitled... who needs a name when the music says it all?  -Dan V
