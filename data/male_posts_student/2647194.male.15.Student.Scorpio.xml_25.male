April 20th: Spring concert at MSA, 7:00.  April 21st: MCTC concert with Random, 7:30.  April 30th: RANDOM concert at MOA!!! Should be fun. *LOCK-IN AT MSA THAT NIGHT*  May 1st: MSA choir concert at Central Park, 7:00.  May 15th: Orchestra concert  May 23rd: Orchestra concert  All that, plus rehearsals, other stuff, yeah...its almost too much.  English paper status: 1.5 pages done, outline turned in.  A small recap:  Math: started chapter 11 yesterday.  Science: Did a web assignment that looked like it was for 8 year olds.  Band: Same old, same old, except there was real fun going on in the trumpet section today...Mr. Shelton had to work that out. I'm sorry, but our trumpet section sucks. Its sound is weak, its 3 players weak, and PETER KARLSTRAND can't play the right f*cking notes. EVER. I know I don't play the trumpet, but if I took lessons, I could play better than him in a few months easily. He fumbles constantly with notes, and our spring concert is 3 weeks away. We NEED our trumpets to play the right notes on Berceuse and Finale. More like we need a few trumpets BACK at MSA. Lets see...Amanda...Eric Gross...Pat Setley...it sucks having a trumpet section of 3, with only 2 people who really know what they're doing.  Spanish: Working on the city maps. etc. etc. etc.  English: 1.5 pages done, and working.  Social: presentations will finish tommorow, current events the same. I'm just thankful we don't have a social studies teacher who brings their own opinions into the classroom. Although...I'm starting to think he's conservative...  I really think I do too much, I think too much, and I try to analyze things way too much. I try to see the ends of everything, and when they're not there, I search even more. Over analyzation takes up too much time. And if I can't analyze something to my liking, I analyze more. Maybe its because I'm Irish, maybe its because I'm German, but I was born like that. It's tough being an overthinker...
