Heres what i can piece together:  Thursday: I went to work at 3,  worked till 5 until my manager left, took a 45 min break on front of a camera >.  Friday:  Woke up at 7....??!!  Ya, something was on my mind.  I responded to an email, talked to some friends... read stuff... ate some small leftover salad for lunch... still had cravings... had some chocolate fudge ice cream (mmmmmmm.....).  Then i got really bored and went upstairs to catch up on lost sleep.  I couldnt sleep so i listened to my B2M cd as i sang along... still couldnt sleep so i started my Usher cd.  I think i dozed off a few times then.  Hmmm... i think i went downstairs for a sec, then returned to my bed and listened to my MD as i felt asleep.  Something woke me up.  I tried to dl some songs, failed... jumped in the shower, sang some songs (wit some1 on my mind)while i was there. Then i got dressed for work, left home, and got there late again.  My dept manager was closing that day so no messing up!!  It was a struggle cuz there was nothing important to do, combine that with trying to impress ur boss and u've got a struggle.  Did everything by the books, 15 (prolly 20) min break... no food T.T .  I did all my work so i picked up the slack for some1 else.  Then we faced the store (gave me time to think...) and i went home.  When i got home i was soooooo hungry.  Luckily my parents left me food.  U shoulda seen it, i practically inhaled that food.  It was dry so i ate it with my hands... faster than a fork :P .  I started an email then stopped when i talked to some1.  Wanted to explode... and went to sleep.  This morning:  I woke up at 8.  I have a dentist appt at 12, getting a filling (maybe).  Guess i dont take good enough care of my teeth... nothing to do after... if u see this in time then feel free to call me after 2 i guess... i'll prolly be really bored and doing nothing.  Or ball... good ol' ball...  AHH!!! I forgot the countdown... T.T ... im such a bad friend... here it is again:  [26]....... :D  This has been my shortest post in awhile.  The last one i wrote was based on a morning, this one i had 2 days of quality material to use... but i cant think.  Don't worry about me... I should be able to resolve (if thats the right word) it in the next few days.  Hmm... I hate the dentist... lol, i was considering becoming one too!!! They dont get long, awkward hours, and they get great teeth!!  Wow... i cant elaborate on anything... i think i'll just go now... do something... maybe get some more sleep...  See y'all later :D
