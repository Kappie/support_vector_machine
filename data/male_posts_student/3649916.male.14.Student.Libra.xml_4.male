I have exams monday and tuesday...also friday.  I didnt do much today just sat in my corner as usual.  Class went by pretty fast, Math was easy, me and my friend robert were text messaging eachother all classes so it was super awesome.  I cannot wait for summer vacation, i definitely want to goto warped tour but i am not aloud to go, noone to go with more like :(  Only 4 more days of seeing my friends for awhile...wow that sucks.  Also last like 3 days i ever see one girl, she is moving to New Brunswick it is extremely shitty.  Today in the world of Britannia, I did not do much.  Mainly i stole ingots from people which was entertaining because they get mad at me and then I just kill them because i am gm fencer hehe.  Then i sold plenty of items I have stolen.  Today was boiling hot, sooo sunny out i practically already cant wait for winter.  Even though i hate winter because it is extremely depressing and dumb dicks throw snowballs at me.  I have Math first period tomorrow, only doing a test and review, should be REALLY easy.  I wish I was out of school already like some others in Vancouver. I live in Squamish BC, very small town, kinda shitty alot of weirdos around here.  I am going to my dads this weekend, it is his Birthday AND fathers day, so i bought him a bottle of vodka, and a nice thing to put on his balcony.  Right now i am feeling kindve pissed off and depressed.  I do not know why I just go through this phase every once in awhile, i guess this is just what i get every once in awhile from kids making fun of me for no reason, which i believe is not cool.
