WHEEE!    Got back to A-town.  Sold my drum set.  Put some money in the bank for my DV camcorder.  A ways away, but the grad money I got from folks was very helpful.  Talked with some folks about possible projects to work on.    I love having lots of projects going at once...if something burns you out, you pick up something else.  Hopefully that will be the nice part of life out of college; I can work on multiple things at once with no fear of deadline.  Of course, if I get a deadline, it's because someone is paying me, which means it's good.    So, I'm currently rewriting Three Strikes, my first script from UT, which had some brilliant moments, but was crudely overwritten.  On the rewrite, I've cut down from 24 pages to 14...for screenwriting, less is good.  We're hoping for a strong rewrite before Andrew's wedding, so I can have it out of the way and let it sit a bit before Kansas.    My other project is a little more interesting...it's something that I kicked around first in 1997 when I decided I would do film but knew nothing about it.  Seven years later, I've written the script.    I want to make a satire filmstrip detailing the dry hump.    Sex Ed was worthless in High School, as Chalymadia and Gonorrhea were Disney Cartoons, and I didn't even know that the vagina was between and not on top (and yes, the guys are nodding in understanding on that line).  So I've decided to write a filmstrip detailing the benefits of what is technically known as Outercourse.    Funny I spend two years of grad school writing character-driven dramas that detail the individual spirit in conflict with society, and the thing that my friends get most excited about is a 60 picture project where two people look like they're getting the ol' jean rub on.  Of course, with proper BEEP sounds, as well as a freaky narrator, and classic melodrama facial contortions, this thing could be genius.
