Carpe Diem means seize the day, as you probably know, in latin... I don't often say it... (speak it) I mostly think it.. or say it while i'm talking on AIM. Crap... i'm getting off topic. Anywho, I forgot my ling. Ugh. Dum dum de doo dum. Anywho.. i'm going to Water Country in williamsburg, va tomorrow with my friend-ish person i've known since I was about two. His mom used to babysit me back then... Anywho.. i'm going with him, his older sister Amanda and her friend Heather who used to be their neighbor before they moved to maine and I used to live down the street from them before I moved to Downtown Gloucester as opposed to the old farm we lived on back then. And they live down in pretentious cocksucker land in the Powhatan Chimney area in Wicomoco on the waterfront. All of the people there seem to be stuck up and have too much money.... their neighbor is supposedly in the mafia and owns a restaurant or something. There's a big dude who drives a big old Cadillac elderado.. like a 70s-ish pimpmobile car that's red. He always parks down the street and walks to the house and comes in the back door at their neighbor's house. Anywho.. I keep getting off topic.  Mood - Somewhat busy... yet bored... yet, I feel like i'm doing something and don't feel like being around people. I feel odd. I always feel odd. I guess i'm... fine. :-p  Music - I'm listening to the sounds of my typing but if I was listening to music, i'd probably be listening to... erm... let's see.... something... soundscapish.... maybe moby's 18 album.   Oh crap crap crap. I suck at HTML. Anywho.. if you want to see my photo album. Copy and paste this link below, into your address bar.   urlLink ">
