Just think of always telling someone where you're going or find yourself in a position of guilt and not knowing why.  Anyway, I just joined a new group in yahoo called  urlLink Goto Bed . It's not a really good group but I'm thinking if I ever wanna go barhopping, I'd at least have one destination in mind. Lookit thru. It's so like a website rather than a group. Just thought you might wanna do some editing in the group if you see how they made it.
