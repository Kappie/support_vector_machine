Everytime during recess, I would play a silly game with CQ. I would try to spot Bright in the crowd of street-bandy players (I call him Bright Bright! HAHA! I got this from Amanda, who claled him Bright Bright a lot). Okay, so today, we four were walking in the parade square. I was saying, "Where's he?" CQ spotted him. Yit Hann was going "Where Who?!". WQ was going "That bastard ar?" three times. (Hello lor! As if you are any better!) Anywhere, YH found out who "he" is. Then, they went on talking about the "affair" between me and Wendy. Like I am the third-party. And that I am stupid to be encouraging them all the time. Come on lor! There's nothing between us!! We are just close friends. Why must people always like that one?! Last time happened to me and Siva. Then now it is me and Wendy. Spread rumours everywhere, and making us feel so uncomfortable. Not really uncomfortable, we usually heck care lor. But this is getting so annoying lor. And I am not stupid to be siding them (Wendy and Bright). they are my friends. I side my friends. If you noticed, I sided you too. Even if you may not remember.   Today, I did a "bad" deed. I refused to give up my seat to a woman with a baby on her arms. Why leh? I was like talking about my argumentative compo I did for my mock exam ("Girls are less capable than boys". I naturally disagree. What a nonsense statement! Crazy conventional thinking! Girls are not lousier than boys, okay?!), then they (CQ, WQ and XC) stared at me and said in a low voice, asking me to give up my seat. I panicked lor. I became very flustered. Three pairs of eyes staring at me (possibly 4, the woman standing near me), expecting me to give up my seat. I refused to give up my seat lor. I just don't know why. I just don't want to live up to sudden expectations, just like that lor. So much pressure is placed on me. Not that I am inconsiderate you know. I would give up my seat, provided I know beforehand lor and no pressure is put on me to give up my seat. Seriously ma. I think you would rather do a kind deed when it is up to you to do it lor, and not your friends there expecting and pressurizing you to do it.   Tomorrow, there's A-Maths lesson after History mock exam (which I only studied the worksheets and notes). Ayioh! This is atrocious! After History mock some more leh! One later! That means what? 3.15? And he's gonna end at 4.45. Or later! HOW CAN I WATCH SABRINA IF IT ENDS AT 4.45? And somemore, tomorrw's Sabrina episode is the last episode!! Last eiposde leh! I cannot afford to miss you know! Therefore, I am skipping A-Maths lesson.With Wendy and Amanda. We are buying Arman's present. Yeah! Arman's present come first. And besides, I get to go home early. I do realise, of course, that my friends have a lot to say about this. But this time, I am putting my foot down lor. Friends and Sabrina comes first! Most definitely they do! And I don't think Radha's teaching new things lor. I can afford to skip la. Even cats skip lessons. Me-ow Meow!   I want to discuss something one. But I forgot what it is. Oh well. That's a sign that I am going. Yeah. See ya tomorrow. Goodnight!
