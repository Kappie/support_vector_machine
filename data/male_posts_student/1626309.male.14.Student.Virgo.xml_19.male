Level 2 Sex Offenders will be shown by the amount of how many are in the community, however, the community police are allowed to Level 2 sex offenders name and addresses if nesscary. Level 3 sex offenders will receive their own profile page with a history of past crimes committed by them. However, this service is a public service and if used for abuse, criminal activities, threats or harassment will be dealt with harsh fines and a prison term.
