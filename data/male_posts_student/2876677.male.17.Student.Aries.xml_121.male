Today, my dad locked himself out of his car so he had his co-worker, Tamika, drive him home.  She is totally awesome.  She is from the South.  Actually, she was raised for most of her childhood in the Chesapeke Bay area like myself.  I have talked to her a few times before but tonight we talked and she is cool.  My dad gave her a tour of the house and she was all compliments.  I felt wicked ungrateful as she went through my house. "Three bedrooms!"  "Two computers"  "THREE FLOORS!!!"  "A LAUNDRY CHUTE!!!THAT'S SO COOL!!"  "You have your own computer!?!  I love this desk!!!"  She was so nice...and she is wicked funny too.  What a blast.  Then at church tonight a "guy" was saw my phone on belt and was like "Oooh.  An LG picture phone.  How much did you pay for that?"  So I told him.  He got out his LG phone and said "Guess how much?"  I said "Free?"  He smugly replied "Yep.  It works great too.  Its not like I need a color phone."  It irritated me.  I do not try to be showy or ostentatious.  I never try to thrust what I have in other people's faces.  I actually try to hide or downplay what I have.  I enjoy what I have and I am blessed but I do not try to show it off.  I have a cell phone.  I don't have a purse.  I wear it on my belt.  I worked hard for my phone.  I am not to trying to flash around what I have...but I have it.  And I don't like people who are...ergh!? what's that word...grr..."stupid will have to do...I don't like people who are stupid and get upset because I have nice things or I have more than they had when they were 17.  I worked at McDonald's for 2 years and now I work at Staples.  It isn't like I was handed nice clothes or my car or my phone or my computer.  I worked hard and I got em.  I don't try to flaunt but I shouldn't have to hide what I have so other people don't get upset.  Why can't people be like Tamika and be happy for me instead of like "him."  Well, I need to go  Write my paper   Read and revise the UN charter   Read Hamlet   Finish organizing  Affinity    Write a mission statement for my charity   Think of a wicked good name for it   Find someone to put the graphic in my head on paper   Find support for the charity   Do lots of other cool stuff  *toodles*
