It was a really long email, and it said his family encouraged him to be pen pals with me. Pretty funny. The subject of the email was "Dear Friend in Christ!" and he ended the email with "Thanking you." He also gave me this  urlLink URL which doesn't work , and I found  urlLink this one that does . In the mean time . . . Blogger is looking kind of flabby around the HTML, and I had a lot of fun in the past few days, despite the lack of sleep. I'm glad we got to hang out with Tim, Brice and Steve, although it wasn't for very long. I don't really have time to post in detail about that, or going to Sugarland today, but it was a pretty great weekend.  Does this blog exist? Is anyone reading this? Do you people think this blog is a waste and that we should just keep two old blogs? Does anyone other than Donna, Sara, and Uglyread this or intend on commenting, ever?
