I'm not sure if it's because the hot dog had the shape of a 'dick,' and hence Kerry, or if I psychically discovered John's favorite food.  So I went upstairs and came up with this:   The year is finally coming closer for re-elections.  Now, every president does things that don't appeal to some people, and does some things that favor others, but nothing comes close to the statements, actions, and opinions of John Kerry.  I don't know to much about the delicate "card-house" of politics, but I recognize dumbasses pretty well.  Let's take a look at the evidence:    BEING LED INTO CONTRADICTION NATION        The War In Iraq-  On October 2002, Kerry stated that he is in full support for the war on Iraq.  Exactly one year later, Kerry stated that we should not have engaged in war.  He claimed Bush did everything wrong.  Why the sudden change in opinion?     Behind the Military's Back-  Here is a quote from Mens News Daily, "Kerry now claims he always supported and always fought for the soldiers. Yet when reviewing his book, The New Soldier, much of the text is found to be anti military, including charges that our service personnel committed unspeakable atrocities against the Vietnamese, including rape, torture, disfigurement and murder." 1      "The Biggest Nothing In History"-  In 1971, Kerry called for an immdediate withdrawal of the U.S. soldiers in Vietnam.  He called it, "The biggest nothing in history."  On February 26, 2004, Kerry said he did not regret supporting the war in Vietnam. 2      War Criminal-  Here's a quote that explains itself.    "There are all kinds of atrocities, and I would have to say that, yes, yes, I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed in that I took part in shootings in free fire zones. I conducted harassment and interdiction fire. I used 50 calibre machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were our only weapon against people. I took part in search and destroy missions, in the burning of villages. All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare, all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down. And I believe that the men who designed these, the men who designed the free fire zone, the men who ordered us, the men who signed off the air raid strike areas, I think these men, by the letter of the law, the same letter of the law that tried Lieutenant Calley, are war criminals."   3    John, however, is in constant hypocrisy as he relentlessly persecutes U.S. Military soldiers.       MORALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY WRONG       Questions Bush-  Kerry, apparently, questions Bush on his actions to protect the American people from the threat of terrorism and Saddam Hussien.       "The Right to Choose"-  Let's say it flatly; Kerry supports the right to kill children.  He calls it, euphemistically, "The Right to Choose."     Tried to Use Berg's Dad-  I'm not sure if the Nick Berg video is real, but Nick's family is pretty certain it is.  Even so, John F. Kerry was seen entering the Berg house; "This grave robber has met with Nick Berg's father in an apparent attempt to turn him into a campaign prop."  4       A Profane President?-  The president, of any country, should have some superior class.  That includes removing profane words from one's vocabulary; at least in public.  Kerry, however, refuses to do so, and speaks profanity in front of live reporters and video cameras.       THE IDIOTIC, SENSELESS, AND ADMITTEDLY FUNNY      Teresa-  How can the would-be president of the United States not know how to pronounce his own wife's name right, let alone handle all of America?      "...One condo commando asked the candidate where the missus [Wife] was. He used the normal American pronunciation ("Ter-EE-suh”), and so did Kerry in replying that she was up in Daytona Beach, though he warned that we’d be seeing more of her...Problem is, as ace columnist Michelle Malkin noted in the March issue of NewsMax Magazine, the Massachusetts Democrat’s highfalutin foreign-born wife calls herself 'Teh-RAY-zah.' The Eurotrash pronunciation is no doubt part of the ketchup queen’s inability to identify with all things American, even her hubby."   5        Not a Very Nice Man-  John Kerry called his secret service agent a "son-of-a-bitch" when the agent accidently went in front of John, causing Kerry to fall over.  Afterwards he said to a reporter, "I don't fall down, the 'son of a b*itch' knocked me over."    A Lying Irish-  John Kerry said before that he wasn't Irish, and he always corrects people when they say he has an Irish ancestry.  The Globe, however, has reported many instances where his staff openly acknowledges that he is in fact, Irish.  Only after the public knew about it, did Kerry change his opinion.  It's not a big deal about his ancestry, but to lie about such a small thing?         HARD TO BE WITH       Officers Told Kerry To Leave Vietnam- Thomas Wright, once a soldier in the same platoon as Kerry, told reporters that the would be Democratic president had bad behavior problems, and thus at Wright's request, was assigned to another platoon.    "I had a lot of trouble getting him to follow orders," Wright recalled. "He had a different view of leadership and operations. Those of us with direct experience working with Kerry found him difficult and oriented toward his personal, rather than unit goals and objectives."    And if that weren't enough, only some time later, "Wright referred to the three Purple Hearts awarded to Kerry, which allowed him to leave Vietnam for the U.S."  6       WHY IS KERRY EVEN RUNNING?        It's one thing when the American public doesn't vote for Kerry, but the democrats also?  Yes it's true, a group called the "Democrats for Bush" support the current president instead of Democrat Kerry.  What does this bring into question about Kerry's choice of actions?  With the supporting evidence above even more questions rise.  For instance, WHY IS KERRY EVEN RUNNING?    So anyways, that was fun.  Let's hope someone brave enough to withstand America's scrutiny will rise and challenge Mr. Bush, not that he's a bad president, but just to redeem the presidential election honor; after a man like this, we're gonna need a darn good runner-up.
