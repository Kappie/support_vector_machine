If she doesnt go to my skool the next monday to some math demonstration i wont be allowed in until she goes there. that sucks major ass but o well who cares. i think im gonna flunk this year... i dont want to! lol i guess i'll have to do my best this tme to pass every class or at least flunk 2. math and geography maybe. the thing that'll help me is the fact that i went to some spanish language contest, u know ortography or spelling and reading. i participated in reading and we were 4th place thanks to me. if i was in the spelling one things would have been better. but o well the spanish teacehr said its kool and that im gonna have a big 10 this time wich is so good, i wont have to do the exam!.  lol if u want tips on how to escape from skool, here are some, this is my escape plan:  1- plan everything since a day before u do it, where you gonna go, with who, when etc.  2- make sure your friends are coming with you if some of them will. keep in contact with them by cellphone or any other way and tell them the plan with clear words so they'll understand  3- if you use skool uniform, make sure you take a different shirt and maybe a jacket or sweater if its cold, when u escape from skool you must not be seen with the uniform cuz people can report you.  4- try to take a knife with you, people may see you with your backpack and stuff and there's a lot of thiefs out there, have something to defend yourself with! and i mean it  5- once you and your friends meet somewhere you already planned, like any street corner or park, act quickly, take a bus to where you're going or just run but this is about not gettin caught.  6- make sure you have somewhere to put your backpack and stuff in, like the house of one of your friends or check your possibilities of hiding it somewhere.  7- take enough money with you, a cap to not be recognized so easy, and all your valuable stuff ( discman, cellphone, keys, money etc.. )  8- if you're planing to go to your house cuz your parents will be at work, do it, but be careful to not be seen by any of your neigbors who can tell your mom, enter your house quickly, dont make unneeded noise that everyone can hear and suspect of. dont answer the phone for any reason, just dont, you can get caught by the social worker or even your mom. if your little brother is at home, make sure you have something to threaten him with, or some candy to keep his mouth closed, and if you're gonna have fun make sure you include him, brothers are dicks and they'll tell your parents what you did without him.  8.1- if you're planning to be late to skool so they wont let you in and you'll return home, the fun is gonna be small. your friends might go to skool and you'll be alone in home like me...  and the final step is one of the most easy and important of all: HAVE FUN.   movies, music, computer, videogames ( play station, xbox etc..), TV, weed/alcohol/tobacco allowed lol, masturbation lmao, sex... whatever that can keep you entertained is gonna be cool.  personally i stay at home and give u tips like these ones lol. the secret for a really cool skool escape is ORGANIZATION. thats all you need, organization and a good plan and thats all.   the plan i followed today was the most simple and old of all of them. since my skool is almost in front of my house, i just gotta cross the road and a small garden and there i am, skool. this time i acted like normal, trying to be late to skool. since it was pretty soon, i get in skool at 7:00 am and my mom leaves home to go to work at 7:30 am, i just instead of walking to the skool i followed the way inside my neighborhood. i just walked like 10 minutes to a park to sit down until it was 7:45 at least. i was sitting in a chair in that park next to a big factory watching the sun rise while listening to "creedence clearwater revival" on my cd player and smoking a cigarette. it was good to feel fresh morning air in my face, followed by those flashing big white lights of the factory, they looked like and airport. birds flying, people sleeping, lone streets, like an abandoned town. and in the middle of grass, trees and birds there was me watching a clear sun rising from the east... or west? lol i dont remember. then i walked back to home and asked an old man what time was it. it was barely 7:30 am. i kept walking like for 10 minutes and i got here. now im all bored and hungry!!!!!!!!! o well dave hasnt signed on yet.... fucker lol.
