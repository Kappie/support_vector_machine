I still feel like I should quit, because I'm so desperately poor, yet I still have some hopes for saving my job. It's a supreme paradox. I think I'll turn in my app to Safeway, but I won't tell my boss or god damn Gabe. That way if I get picked at Safeway, I can either turn down the offer, or take it if my job gets worse.  This post is just a short break from the most fun game I have played in a long time. I'm talking about Quake 3 Arena. The action is fast, the weapons are good, and it's just so much fun. I can't stay away any longer, I've got to get back to the actions.  urlLink You should download the demo.
