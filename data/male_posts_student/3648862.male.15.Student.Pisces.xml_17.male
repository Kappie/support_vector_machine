Somehow I found myself on top of Ryan, fully dressed, you sick perverts. We looked at eachother and Ryan said he love me. I asked him if he ment it and he said that he loved me again and he told me I could kiss him if I want, so I did. Thats how the dream ended. Just when I thought I had stoped missing him this dream came along. This sucks, now I'm lovesick and Benny is supposed to come over tomarrow, so I'll try to hold myself back, but when I get deppressed like this I might do anything. Sorry Ryo, I know he's only 12 but I like him and I need to have love in my life. Crap the lights are about to go out. TTYL
