Mrs. Lawley spent at least 4 lessons revising things with us and then gave us a paper with hardly anything revised in it!  How so totally stupid *Rolls eyes*, and on the subject of Mrs. Lawley, imagine this...  You're sitting in an exam.  The dingy dusty air is flowing, the sun is in your eyes and your conecntrating on a really hard question when, out of the blue... CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP CLOP!  Mrs. Lawley enters the room.  Her shoes make a bloody loud noise on the hall floor, which is so annoying!  It was as if a horse had entered the room lol.  Still, her shoes aint half as bad as one of the receptionist's... BANG BANG BANG BANG (literally) all the way down the corridoor, you can sure tell when she's coming! (Earthquake in Australia!)  Anyway, the rest of the day resumed as usual with an easy peasy RE exam to end the day.  I, with the help of Chris' priceless Mrs. Checketts impression, have made a mock song called "What's New Pussehcat".  I'll let your imagination dwell on that one... G'dnight!
