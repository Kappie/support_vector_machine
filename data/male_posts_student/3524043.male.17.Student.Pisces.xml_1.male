However to me it is a vast ground of inexhaustible knowledge and imagination. Unlike anything on earth, the space has no boundaries or obstacles. When I say that it has no obstacles I mean to say that there is not limit to the flight of imagination and fascination. One might say that imagination and fascination have no boundaries but I believe otherwise. On earth the imagination is limited, and fascination restricted. No sane person can believe aliens as living on the earth, or at least he will never be able to convince even his own mind to except the eccentric idea. However, in space there cannot be any limit, for all we know there might actually be aliens living on some planet.  The space also offers an inexhaustible knowledge for anyone who cares. Indeed the knowledge and information is too vast to be learnt in a single life times, or for that mater in a few life times. Someone once told me that the space was very unforgiving and the delay between action and result was too large. Indeed, a person starting a project in space today cannot hope for results within his lifetime, but even this fact holds a fascination for me. I can be sure that for once whatever I do I am not selfish as the only beneficiaries would be the future generations. Don’t get me wrong. I am not planning a career in space nor in any related fields yet I believe in what I have said just now.  To me the only fascination in space is related to the imagination and the visualization. I love to look into the night sky and keep looking for a long time. I can practically look into the sky for the whole night, without feeling any boredom. Even the smallest star holds a whole world, thousands of time larger then ours and with infinite possibilities. I can almost feel myself walking on that planet, feeling the soft sand on my bare feet, and smell the air (although there might not be any air fit for human consumption on the planet in reality).  When I look onto the sky I do not see individual stars but a system - an impeccable system. To me the fact that the system works without a problem and has been doing so for millions or years is not a miracle but actually a sign of a greater force. However, I do not intend this to be an article about religion so I will say no more if the signs I see. Indeed I am greatly intrigued by the separate stars, each with a different history and characteristics, but the perfectly working system is much more interesting.  The system, when one comes to think of it, has a cycle of millions of years. Some of the phenomenons are repeated after thousands of years but with impeccable accuracy. The system actually consists of many smaller systems, some like our solar system, but also some very different systems. Even the meteors and planetary movement in a system and they all work simultaneously and with a perfect timing to form the larger system. This as a whole is indeed worth a mention. The starts are placed according to a plan and each star plays an important role in the bigger picture.  Whatever other people might think, to me, as I said before, the sky and the space hold great fascination and intrigue. I might not have explained my feeling properly and the reader might find it difficult to understand what I say and see from my point of view. Yet the only defense I have is that the feeling is not easy to explain as no words can portray it completely.
