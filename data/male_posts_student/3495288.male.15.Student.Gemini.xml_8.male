As usual went to school. Well during free period, P.E. lesson, i heard that Amirul, this guy who have been chasing after me for quiet sometime, is going to get either public canning or just a canning in the office. I am feeling kind of guilty. A close friend of Amirul came up to me and gave me a letter from him.   Dear Deen,   Thanks a lot for telling the DM (discipline Masters/Mistress). Have a happy life... BTW have a happy life.   That was what the letter said. I felt guilty because he is a good friend. Happy life? Me? Happy? No one is happy... I am just always cheerful not happy just don't be near me when my alter-ego brother comes out. Than i had my most favorite lesson, Maths... i am beginning to like maths because of the teachers. After school i had Maths remedial. When i saw my two maths teachers i ran up to them excitedly, "Oh My Dearest Mdm Jas and Mrs Mak! You are the greatest Maths teacher i ever have! You made me LOVE MATHS! IN return I LOVE YOU! (so i giggled into class hahah)".. but than Mdm Jas said "No thats ok my dearest Saifuddeen. No need to love us just in return you give us GOOD RESULTS."...hahah. Well ok lets skip the maths remedial and band.   After band i love to come up to the members and tell them i the ear to stand in attention. Haha. Well i went to McDonald's with Rebecca and Rashid aka Rah-Rah. When we took our seats Eddy came in and asked if he could join us. In excitement, both me and Rah-rah, Rashid forced Eddy to sit down. Well he sat down in front of me. Suprisingly my school's principle went to McDonald's and bought a dinner. I came up to her and said HI. Took out my wallet and decided to buy two ice-cream cone. Eddy jumped up to me and gave me a kiss on my cheek. Like it is not like him to give me a kiss you know. Ok so what if he is a little gayish at times, knows that i am gay, i care for him, protects him... etc. Like its impossible to explain the feeling because it is best to feel it. When i look at him, he was blushing. When i have bought my ice-cream he spanked my butt. That boy must be horny. Once our ice-cream have gone down into our stomach, Eddy asked me accompany him to POPULAR bookstore to buy something. He wanted to buy a new book. While browsing through the books, Eddy went to the lowest shelf. He sat down on the floor infront of me. His head was just right infront of my crotch. No one was around at that time. What he did was turn his head to the left and gave a soft bite on my crothch. Like OUCH... that gave me a hard on!. My face went red like a skin of a Tomato. Like why is Eddy doing this to me? What does he wants from me? He stood up and told me not to tell Rashid and imagine that did not happened. No! we did not smooch ok. For heavens sake he is 14 and shorter than me, he is my junior and my little gawd-chinese-bro. While searching for his book, i rested my head on his shoulder. He looked at me and gave me a kiss on my forehead. Like whats up with this guy? When he found his favorite book and Q up, He gave me a wink. Once he finished purchasing that book Eddy told me not to be jealous if Rashid starts to touch him or what. I just nodded my head like Noddy in Toyland. On the way home Rashid started to put his arm around Eddy. Nope i did not get jealous or what. What for i should get jealous. He is not my boyfriend. When we had to be separated, i looked at Eddy and he gave me a wink again. So there i started walking home alone as usual. Well till here than... thats all i gotta write. BYE!
