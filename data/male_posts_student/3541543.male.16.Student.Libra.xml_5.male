It just sucks and later that day I was having lunch at Del Rio with Ash and the waitress says "How's it going ladies?". What the crap was that I got a short hair cut and she thinks I'm a woman! Yeah it sucked and I felt bad because my hair was dumb and I looked like a girl. She probably she I was a dike but yeah lol I can't wait for it to grow back. Alright well see ya later.
