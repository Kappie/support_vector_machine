Its fun being Irish on this day, but then again, its fun to be Irish anyways.  I still dont think Im crossing into the realm of overkill on this holiday.  Last year, I drank a bottle of Baileys and a case of Guinness with Steve.  Man, I miss those days.  Even had a dream last night about going to the Lodge.  Was kinda weird.  I miss those care free days where any non class time was spent playing games or just hanging out with the people you care about most.  I find my life is way too boring now, not like it was full of fun and excitement before.  But I go to class, watch Piper, go to TKD, call Sammy and fall asleep while talking to her.  I have too many worries now as well.  I worry about money, finding a job, my debt, my weight, my health, my education, my everything.  I cant help but worry about all these things and where I am heading.  Im sure everything will be ok once the Zoo starts picking up again.  Im not taking class this summer, and hopefully I will make enough money between the zoo and possibly a CNA job to pay off all debt and maybe start some fund of sorts for something special... but then again, Ive been saying that for a year now.  The COD tuition has been kicking my ass.  I know that tuition there is not that bad compared to U of I, but when its all you have, then you worry about how you are going to pay your bills the next month.  I think its time to stop all spending of all sorts, pending gas money.  Oh well.  I listened to others telling me that going to Borders for a month then quitting would be a dick move.  Although right now, I couldnt give a damn, as that would have been an easy couple hundred bucks.  But then again, being a dick at a job that really means nothing to me just shows how immature I am, right?  So anyways, the concert Monday night rocked.  Stroke 9 was great, even though they arent what I would deem exceptional music.  I just think they try to hard to rock out and it makes them kinda standard.  I wouldnt call it emo, but thats the closest thing I could call it.  Sam and Andi had fun making fun of me for not really dancing to the music.  But I just didnt get into it too much.  Phantom Planet, although being scrawny motherfuckers, put on an exceptional show.  Very high energy, doing stage dives, running into the audience, and having a blast while doing it.  I felt kinda weird going into it because for both bands, I have only heard their mainstream stuff, but after the concert, I realized that even that mainstream stuff was alot more than others had known.  Apparently, this was WMU's first big concert ever, so that was kinda cool.  The auditorium was about as big as Foellenger, so it was pretty cool to be that close.  We were pretty much in the back, and it was only row 16. Not too shabby.  Anyways, the people right in front of us left after Stroke 9, and when we were walking out, I overheard this one guy saying "No man, we just came to see Stroke 9, Ive never even heard of the other guys..."  I think thats just hysterical.  I would at least have stuck around to HEAR the other band, even if Ive never heard of them, just to see if they were any good.  it was funny, Phantom Planet was even advertised as "the band that does the theme song to OC"  I can say at least Ive heard Lonely Day, Anthem, Big Brat, and a few more to the point where I could sing along.  But everyone was chanting to hear California, and I think that kinda put them off.  Oh well, cant always please rock stars.  But I had fun.    Oh yeah, the crowd was very funny too.  Not funny ha-ha, but funny odd.  We couldnt really pick out the fanbase.  There were kids who were about 12 with braces (we saw their parents pick them up!).  ALOT of kids actually.  Then there were dirty people to our sides.  I think you know what Im talking about.  The stoners that dress out of urban outfitters and smelled like they havent showered in a week or two.  Then there were the Abercrombie preps who were totally rocking out to both bands.  Drunk?  Perhaps.  Or just really overzealous.  Then there were the punk wanna be's.  Like I said it was a very odd crowd.  I wonder where I would fit in with those in my jeans and t-shirt... ha!  Oh well.    My weekend was fun though (as I go backwards through time).  The Chicago Bar Association puts on a killer big band ball.  Had a blast with Lark (as Sammy calls my "home" girlfriend).  The food was great and the music was great, even though there werent that many people dancing.  But we had fun.  Mary Jo (my other home girlfriend, as Sammy calls her) came Sunday night and we went with Lark to the dojo to teach her some Capoeira.  She showed me the yellow cord she got from Brazil.  I dont care what anyone else says, I think she totally deserves it.  I think that some of the others from Champaign are just really jealous.  I mean, when someone goes to Brazil for six months to train, thats pretty hardcore.  That, and I think she does have the talent for it and really deserves it.  But anyways, the three of us had a fun time, and while there was no roda, I had alot of fun.  I kinda really miss capoeira, but between that and TKD, TKD wins with the time and money departments.  Maybe when I get my 3rd or 4th degree, I will call it quits with that style.  That may be a few years though.  Then I will most likely move on to a different style, hopefully capoeira, maybe wing chun, wushu, aikido, iado, I dunno.  Oh well, Ive just blow enough time writing this to keep me occupied a little while longer.  It's time to get back to looking for a nursing school.
