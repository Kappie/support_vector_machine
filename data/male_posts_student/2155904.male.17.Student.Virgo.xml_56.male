The only thing that kept it from being one is that he got to spend a couple hours with Purdy and Tina!  They both came over along with Purdy's cousin.  It wasn't horrible but when they ran out of things to do it just seemed like a bummer.  They liked the Amazed music video even though it was a little creepy.  But it was not awkward between Tyke and Tina.  They both acted normal except when Purdy videotaped Tina and then said "this is the love of Tyke's life", Tina was like "Nooo, don't say that" or something like that.  Tyke can't actually remember what went on exactly.  But it is definitely on tape.  So now he will go watch the tape to find out.  Ok, that is over.  He seriously just left his blog to go watch the whole video.  Well, it just emphasized how it kinda sucked.  There was a lot of Tina in it and that is why it was decent though.  Oh fuck...here it comes again.  Shiiiit.  That fucking feeling has just come flying back to Tyke.  Not the strong desire for Tina, although that is still there, but the loneliness.  Shiiiiiiiit.  It was gone for a little while.  But damnit, now it is back.  And it sucks big time.  Well, here is an attempt at an explanation.  There is this sharp little feeling a little above his heart and then a little above his stomach.  It kinda sends a pulse through his abdomen and that starts to make this feeling that flows through his body.  Then his mind starts acting up too.  It gets distraught and sorta depressed.  He thinks about what he wants to be doing and have and wishes for it.  Yet he knows nothing will come of it and that is where the pain resides.  In the nothingness.  The deep and bottomless pit that can only be filled with the companionship of others.  It can be filled but it just hasn't been.  Simply hanging out with people really does help.  But over break that really has not happened since the party A WEEK AGO!  Tonight could have been a chance to build on that but it floundered in its own despair.  It was kinda damned from the start.  Only one event planned for the night (DDR) and only 2 definite guests for the night.  Tina was a possibility and she ended up coming through in the end.  Well, this just spelled disaster.  Now don't get Tyke wrong...hanging out with them was awesome just cuz he got to be in their company.  But then they left after being there for less than 2 hours to go bowl.  Of course Purdy offered for the guys to come but how much fun would that be for them?  It really wouldn't have been that entertaining.  This is just gay though.  Like, there is so much right out there for Tyke but none of it is reachable.  Kinda like throwing out some candy to a baby but then yoinking it right back from its face.  So then the baby starts to cry...well Tyke hasn't actually cried about this but it still is sorta pissing him off.  It isn't anyone's fault but his own really.  And maybe it ain't his fault either.  But this hell-hole has to be ditched and left for a promising new region filled with lavender skies and peach-colored dew.  Tyke is far from being in dire straits here but he really wants some help.  The main problem is just that nobody can give Tyke the exact medicine he needs.  He just needs a person(s) to just be there for him and spend time with him.  If any person could do that then he would be so grateful.  Yet again, the people that seem to truly be able to do that are guys.  And it just isn't the same after a while.  He needs that feminine contact.  He longs for it.  He searches for it.  He comes back to no avail.  At one point in the night he almost wished for school to start up again.  Then he realized he must be insane and went back to thinking about other less depressing things.  He can only hold himself back for so long before things go insane.  Fuck some of this shit...
