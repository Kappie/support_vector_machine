Let's clear up one point for the record.  The policies that are in place right now are due to the last President.  The economy is in the craper you say?  Well that's because of the previous administration's policies.  It takes years for a bill to finally pass and start affecting the nation.  By that time, a new President is in office.  Don't blame Bush for Clinton's mistakes!  History will judge Bush in the end, and I believe it will look at him in a positive light.  I think next time we'll talk about geopolitics.  Word of the Day: quiescence (quiescent) - inactivity; stillness
