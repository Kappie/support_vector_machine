The only negative effect apart from nightmares is that I can't recall certain words like I used to, don't know why.  But other than that, I just noticed my sb (subconscious from now on) has been working in overdrive everwhere. I'm able to imagine completely original and independent things, like the African-American young boy, on a train, looking at his watch, and even though they may not be amazingly sparking ideas they are completely original and not derived. I think I hit the first step in breaking into my brain. I also noticed that my sb is working on MY problems now, not just running off in random directions (which was why I was probably so good at word recollection). For example, I found out that my sb was thinking about my crush all through my English exam, and when it came time for creative writing I just out of the blue decided to write one on a romantic comedy.  I really don't mind it too much, it's amazing to sit there with your eyes half open and let your mind wander to the strangest places you've ever been. You just start slowly swinging your head, and you feel only semi-there, and start melting away in your head. You can imagine whole worlds on your own doorstep.   General  Anyway =) I have once again gone no-where today, and the VSG school hsan't gotten back to me yet, and I'm getting braces tomorrow... Hmm...   Style and Simplification  Beauty comes through simplification and style... Simplification to represent only what needs representation, for example, like most comics, they only represent what needs it, and what's the use of highly detailing the left side of a car when you're never going to see it. Can you get the same effect with a sphere as a highly subsurfed and carefully tended model? Style, everyone needs style, as style is what will help you define a work. Some people's styles come through colour schemes, others through the use (or overuse) of certain techniques in post pro, or others just by doing something no-one else could. Some people try to develop for a world, so that people think of it and like it like a telivision series, waiting for the next 'episode'! A lot of things generally =) I must persevere to try and discover my style...  WooT WooT!   The Moon, Lunus pretiosum  I think that translate into 'the precious moon', but I'm not sure. Pretiosus/a is precious/dear, I know that, but there are some disrepcancies on lunus/luna. Either way, I don't have my Latin books here =) Just a general note, the moonlight has been excedingly bright recently. So bright infact that my alarm woke me up a few nights ago, and I thought it was broken, because there were shadows on my wall from all the light. It was actually the moonlight. This light was just so piercingly strong that I could see everything around my house, a good 5-10 kilometre view, perfectly, apart from a few areas bathed in fog.  Maybe it's a sign decreed by the ancient Hindus showing that the moon is at a perfect reflective angle to the sun, signalling that the moon shall fall out of it's orbit and crash into the earth... =)  Well, we can all still hope right? =P
