To be rewarded in ones thought through the demonstration of absolute incompetence is great. In fact there a very few better pleasures. The problem comes when one can not dettach itself from it. Things do get nasty by the minute, by the second, but hey is that not what we call fun by all means.   Mood: Pissed off I guess... very pissed off
