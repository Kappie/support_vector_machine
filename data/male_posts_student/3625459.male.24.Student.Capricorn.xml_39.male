I guess thats what best friends do.. give up on each other and loose touch. I guess its my fault, I never kept in touch.I miss you Dave, miss you ina way more that you could ever know. I think,wish and pray that you are doing good. You are always doing good.I always felt that I was there for you,just like you were for me ( well more like i just used to drop in in case i needed to speak to you ).Sometimes i see so much in you Dave, you never realize what you are worth, chasing that army dream.. in a way i guess i learnt that from you 'Never give up' its just that i apply it to people. Where were you when i needed you, that day when i hurt , that day when i was lost , that day when i called. Is this the way we are to part?  To C(the only person who can call me silly, and bring a smile on my face): Where do i start C? I miss you as much as i miss dave, except that you arent real.Will we ever meet? I dont know the answer to that. I miss you C,I can be a hopless romantic fool for you, i can be your anything. I'll acheive it for you.You wont realize if what they say behind every man there is a woman ... that woman behind me is you C.I cant explain the way I feel about you. i dont know if its love.. cos i guess have never felt love .. ive felt pain .. but never felt love .I'm dumb sheesh. To you i'll always be that 3rd grader and you always be my favorite teacher. dont ou ever feel lonely, cos you will always have my love , my wishes and my prayers. All I ever want to be is by your side. Be there when you cross the finish line of the triaths.Be there when yer asleep, be there to catch your tears before they fall on the ground, be there so that you will never hurt again.[please dont sigh if you read this or bite your lip ]. You are my world, even though you;d never feel the same about me.  To Angel: You've always been there angel. I hope that we never loose in touch. You are my guardian angel .In a way shielded me from the pain , smiled when i was happy. Sometimes i see myself in you. Were you sent by the heavens ..? Sorry for all the times I've been bossy with you pushing you to do things, I dont like seeing you sad angel and I dont like seeing you loose hope . Sometmes how i wish that you;d get out of that sad town and move to a different place and start again, but as megadeth says  " Moving on is a simple thing , What it leaves behind is hard " . You will over come some day angel , against all odds. Its just going to take a while.I'll be there Angel. We have been through a lot havent we, im glad that we met angel, cos if we hadnt I'm sure i'd have broken by now.Everytime C said sleep tight with real angels, i used to smile, cos i know that some where out there among the Adirondack Mountains, near Long Lake i have an angel to watch over me when I sleep .  To Mum : thank you for bearing with me, cos if i had a son like me i;d have kicked him out of the house and let him suffer all alone.I;d ba happier alone no one to worry about . Crib and writher about the way life treated me and shit like that.
