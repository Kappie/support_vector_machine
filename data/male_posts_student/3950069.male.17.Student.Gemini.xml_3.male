And the better me can't show its side    I will try to find my way to higher ground"        Satellite- Santana feat. Jorge Moreno       I'm happy, I won't deny it now. I'm so happy when i'm with  you , you're like a new breath of air to me, refreshing and uplifting. I'm getting my confidence and faith back, slowly, bit by bit. We're both starting to believe in ourselves again, aren't we? -smiles-   Today was alright, plain and boring. I had the weekend to pick myself up, and now school's back on, ergh..somehow I felt so sluggish today. As usual, Kuan KO was right on time, well like 1 minute early. But that doesn't mean people who come in just 1 minute after are late right? bah, he actually scolded some people for being late when they came right at 1300. Is he trying to be cute or what? I'm really wondering, is Kuan KO stupid, or some act cute fella? Man can you believe he actually said, "I know a lot of girls wanna marry me, right?" Oh god. Irene told me about what she and Reiko had been imagining, Kuan KO in a white singlet, ragged and torn pants, holding what seems to be an "erhu" and playing away like it was a violin. Plus what I read from Irene's blog, "..., and biting his prata." Lol rene, you crack me up so much(cheoooonnggggg arhhh!!! -grins-). I guess Kuan KO leaves us with a bittersweet feeling, never fails to crack us up with that silly moustache and really ridiculous comments sometimes, yet he's so irritating.   Before I forget, my first lesson was "Thinking and Problem solving" The things we did today were seriously boriiiiing -bleh- And so much for C programming, I lasted like 1 hr and 20 mins of the 2 hrs before starting to slack away. At least I know I absorbed most of it today, unlike the times when I left the lecture room feeling empty inside, knowing absolutely nothing. I'll buck up (:   Basically, it was a Blue monday(monday blues) how cliched. I headed home right after school, time to finish up my math tutorials plus C programming!   Kesh, i'm so glad you're getting your writing back (: beautiful works.   I'm feeling better, stronger. I'm finding my faith again, i'm learning all the time. " Lose but don't lose the lesson ". I know  you  will be with me, right here by my side. I'm learning to let go, of my wallet, but its still something really important to me.    [I dare you// to love me.]         In your arms, holds the happiness I seek.      In your heart, lies a love, a faith so important to me.      In your eyes, there's onlyme.            Everything I am to you, you are to me.
