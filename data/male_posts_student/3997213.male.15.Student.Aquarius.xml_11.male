(It wasn't as much as the day before though) Anyway, today was different. I woke up craving a chocolate donut knowing we had a box of them in the kitchen. I ate one for breakfast, turned around an hour or so later, and they're gone. Things go fast around here. The motto: If you don't get it while you can, you'll never get it. In other words, you snooze you looze. Now how true is that? Reid had a friend over again like every other day. They go and climb trees. Isn't that exciting? Mom took us to Toys'R Us because she had to pick up a few things for Westampton Day and I bought a new playstation game. We went to the dollar store after that for a few more things and I got some stuff there. Dollar stores are funny. I had gymnastics at 5:00 but before that I jumped in the pool. It was cold thanks to all this darn rain so I wasn't in long. I went on the computer for a bit and that was when time flew by. I looked at the clock and had to be out the door in 5 minutes for gymnastics. I hate it when that happens. It turns out, I would have saved myself a lot of pain if I didn't go. I'm not saying that I DON'T want to go anymore. Otherwise, I wouldn't have these bruises on my arms right now. I did a handstand on those parrell bars and fell forwards over onto my legs and arms. It hurt. It was embarressing. It left a nasty pain. My arms are all red but they don't hurt too much. I'm proud of myself. I'll have you know I only cried for an hour. ;)
