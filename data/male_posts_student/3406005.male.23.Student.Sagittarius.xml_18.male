Its damn nice to see that the ungodly alliance of Liberals and NDs still doesn't reach 155 and can therefore still be taken down when Harper and Duceppe collude.   Also: Stan Keyes was defeated. Maybe its his mustache, maybe its his never-ending sanctimony, but that guy drove me crazy (and not in a good way).
