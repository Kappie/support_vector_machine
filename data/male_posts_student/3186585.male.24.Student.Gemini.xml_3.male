Let me just say now, booking via the web is far and away the smartest move you can make. The savings are at worst, substantial. Check out some of the excellent deals on offer in the  urlLink STA  web-site for students and those of us on a tight budget.    Not surprisingly the competition between NSW and Victorian snow resorts this season is going to be fierce! It seems like the media marketing blitz has already begun and that it gets bigger every year. I've already seen and heard heaps of commercials on TV, radio, the web, and in the papers. It's definately gonna be an interesting inter-state race to see who captures the market in 2004. In NSW  urlLink Thredbo  and  urlLink  Perisher  have some of their usual alpine deals for early birds, as do  urlLink Falls Creek  and  urlLink  Mt Hotham  of Victoria. Careful with these ones tho, the snow conditions can be pretty sketchy this time of year! I'ts probably best to try and get in early and secure your accomodation for the high season. I've found that the longer you wait the less chance you have of securing what you want, when you want, at the price you want.
