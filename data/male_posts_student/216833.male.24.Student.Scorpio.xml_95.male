I will have a chance to learn new skills as far as SAP and IBM AS/400 but I am pretty much stuck in the computer room. I'm gonna have to bring a hoodie up in here cuz it's cold. I don't really have the option of changing the temp. I could just come in her every 20 minutes and check on shit but my phone and computer are in here now and I like to have a home at work. Some small space to call my own. I guess that is the same reason people decorate there work space. You want to feel comfortable.  I like having locked doors that have to be locked at all times. Keeps people from walking in my office without me expecting it. Sometimes I'm like to play puzzle games and talk to friends on AIM while I bored. I don't want that to become an issue if you know what I mean. Now it is less likly to make an impact. Plus, I have a new feeling of security as far as my job goes and that is nice. Everyone seems to want me in this seat, they all feel that my easy-going personality is better suited for this position that the other guy Rob. I guess there have been a few conflicts as far as that goes. I just roll with the punches like I always say. Bring it on, cuz I can always deal.   I can atleast listen to my music at a normal level in here. When I had the post in the hall I was always worried about being to loud. There are so many fans and buzzing electronic noises in here that I have a hard time hearing people on the phone. It's not that bad.  I brought my lunch today. Kinda reminds me of going to school. I would always bring my lunch. I just don't want to get outside at 1pm to go to my car with the melted steering wheel in the dead heat of the summer just to waste money and gas on some sub-par meal. I think I will be bringing my lunch from now on. Oh well. I think I will like it - I do enjoy going to lunch with the GUYS, but I have a feeling that being in here away from the everyday PC support (I'm the backup guy now) will seperate my close ties to those guys. Maybe not, I do work out with em every day.  Oh yeah, today we are working on the back. It's normally a short workout, because James wife comes in to do arobics with an instructor and he goes to lunch with her afterwards. Her workout is only 30 minutes so we cut it short so he can get out with her. I think I will just stay in there and get some jogging in. I need some of that FAMOUS LATIN STAMINA!   HAHA. Sorry - I was playing more GTA3 last night. The Asian chick was beating up the vato from the cartel and she said that. I watched a little bit of TV and cooked up a big pot of beans. They are sooooo good. I cooked em for about 4 hours and but some chilepowder, cumin, garlic pepper, fresh garlic, one onion, about three tablespoons of butter and three tablespoons of that Jack Daniels bar b q sauce and some salt and black pepper. It turned out nice, but my I got some mad gas. I think something crawled up my ass and died.   I need a stereo with a CD player in here - I have been listening to the radio, AC/DC rules.
