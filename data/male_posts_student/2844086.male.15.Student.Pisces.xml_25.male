But then I take that back, because I don't have to prove myself to anyone. I just wish that someone would accept my calling. Well Ms. Rhonda believes in me. I think that Mama has finally accepted it.  Still there are people like Grandmama, Jesseka, and just about the rest of the world that try to bring me down. Bryan Davis posted a message on the Youth Group guest book. It was very helpful. Messages of encouragement are so precious in a time like this.  Lord, my prayer is that You would just hold me up when people's words tear me down.  AMEN!
