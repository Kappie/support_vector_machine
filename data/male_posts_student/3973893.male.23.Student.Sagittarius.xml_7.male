I have been busy, but that is no excuse for leaving you in the bitter dark of the void known as cyber-space.  What have I been doing? Well, a week ago last Tuesday I went camping with my friend Kyri and her brother Philip, we went, of course, to Casa Bonita and had a good time. This past weekend  urlLink Scott  came down and we went to the  urlLink Scandinavian Festival ! The best part of the festival is the food so I had a bunch of Swedish meat pies this weekend - four in total, I think. I've always wondered if Swedish meat pies are really Swedish and if they are, if they're some sort of American bastardization that I have come to love over the years. There's also the Danish shaved ice booth - which, of course, is 100% authentic ;) My sister remarked that she thought the Scandi Fest was smaller this year and asked me to pay attention to that when I went. It's not that I think it's smaller, I just think that, as with most things, when you get older things around you have a way of getting smaller. Things you once viewed as huge or important are somehow smaller now. The one exception to this is, of course, Disneyland ;)
