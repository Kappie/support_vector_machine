We (Linz,Stephanie,Zach, and I) had fun we made up words by playing "Scrbble" talked, laughed, ate, had blonde moments, watched tv, and listened to music. Yeah one of tghe fun words was "Jrshamoff"- displaying immaturity at a fifth gradde level. lol. But yea that party was really kewland some other stuff happened today having to do with an e-mail and a phone call that confirmed the e-mail. I know it's cryptic, but that's what I what it to be!!
