Overall, cramming didn't go too badly (apart from one night/morning when I had to study for three exams the next day... Not fun! =P) Of course, now I can joke about it, but if you caught me two or three days ago I wouldn't been a possible homocide case lol  Anyway, paradise is ensuing, and I'm starting to relax. I also bought Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring Special Extended Edition (the names nearly worth the cover price itself lol). Excellent making ofs (two DVDs) and high quality widescreen movie discs including commentary. Overall, darn excellent (not as good as Pixar, but who can beat them? =P)   Quick thought    Also, quick note on exam marks, 93% in Latin (non difficile est), but 85% in Maths (starting to show the midnight burn, but I am in top class, which is pretty good for it being my worst subject). Others should be coming back soon.   ----  I also did a quick artwork, relating to an award competition in 3D, link to the JPG here   (copyright as this is my actual work, if you want to use it slip me an email) Basically a spun polygon mesh, some procedural textures, ambient occlusion, new angular mapping (same technique used to compress HDRI images) and of course good old  urlLink Blender  for all the 3D! =) Just a quick work to get the rust off of my fingertips. Really could have done better on the handles, but apart from that I'm happy
