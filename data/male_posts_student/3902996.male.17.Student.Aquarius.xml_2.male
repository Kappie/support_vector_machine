Why do I insist on going for the ones that are..... never interested? _________________________________________________________________  i guess if i think about it the only person i was foolin, was myself....... I think before, i still believed in that little thing called hope, sadly enough my hope has been shattered just about as many times as heart. a couple more times though..... OSSM tends to shatter hopes faster than anything else  i would have to say that it is always me because, well the world is never fair.... why should it be any different for me?  on the subject of why do i go after the uninterested ones...... you know the saying "You always want what you cant have?" well that's what happened with me, on many occasions...... i always pick the one that are out of my league, i dunno if it is stupidity, or ego.... either way not gonna happen anymore, hopefully...  it's a funny thing... when you are try so hard for someone's attention, that you are doing crazy things.... and then it turns out that someone either doesnt care or doesnt even know. you know what hurts the most, if they dont even know... cause that just means you did everything for nothing  sigh..... well like my friend said, "The Past is....... Past" i guess it's true, that past the i try to put in the past always comes back to bite me in the ass....   well, i better wrap this heart-felt entry up.....    :-(
