God does that for me.  its a genuine feeling.  i love her and thats why i want to be with her.  i guess i couldnt complain.  maybe at least for a little while i could feel what is was like to be loved in return.  cuz i know she loved me.  even if she lost the feeling.  at i could feel it for a little bit.  and lemme tell ya it was great.  it was a wonderful feeling.  gosh i love her so much.
