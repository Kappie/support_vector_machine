I no longer work at Pancho's due to football and school. I'm kinda happy to leave but I made some good new friends so it's bitter sweet. Yesterday I hung out a Jessee's house for most of the day. I had a good time, got to finally meet Sadie and Zsofi. We played video games, and did cross word puzzles, but there were some times that were quiet where there was some what of an awkwardness, but in all it felt right. Today I went to Matt's and just played video games the whole time. We also went to lunch at the Frisco Shop with his dad, who is the coolest person I know, and we just talked about Napoleon Dynamite. I saw Napoleon D. with Tim on Tuesday, and it was easily one of the greatest movies ever made. I was surprised at how it depicts the troubles of high school, and shows how everyone can relate to the most unorthodox person they have ever seen. It was the only movie I've seen this summer, and it was great. After lunch, Matt and I went back to his house, and we talked, and looked at my truck. We decided to take some stickers off of the back window, and this proved to be more challenging than we thought. The tint was placed over the stickers, so now I have this square in the back window that doesn't have any tint at all, it's so awesome! Summer football practice is almost over, all we have left are one practice a day, and it only lasts for like an hour and a half and a scrimmage on Saturday, then school starts. I wish the summer can be longer, but I'm excited for school to start, it's another bitter sweet type of deal. That's it for now, rock on..... till next time.......
