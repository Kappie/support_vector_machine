Mal's feelings for me are lost.  i realized today that it was gone.  that sweet girl that i fell in love with.  she wasnt there anymore.  that tenderness was no where to be found.  the understanding was gone.  the assurance and the comfort from her was gone.  and that look she would give me was gone.  her love for me was lost.  and now i have deal with the pain and the hopelessness.  the cruel reality.  i have to live with a love that will not be returned.  a love without hope...
