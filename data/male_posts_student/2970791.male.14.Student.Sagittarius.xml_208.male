A construction worker in Lancaster, Calif., is   expected to make a full recovery after accidentally being shot in the   head with a nail gun -- six times. Three of the nails penetrated his   brain; one entered his spinal column, but luckily not his spinal cord.   Witnesses say Isidro Mejia, 39, fell from the roof of the house he was   building onto another worker who was using the gun below. "The guy   holding the nail gun was grabbing to keep from falling, and just   gripped tighter on the trigger," said a Los Angeles County sheriff's   investigator. "It's a nail gun they use for framing. It can drive nails   through 2-by-4s." (Los Angeles Times) ...It's the first time L.A. cops   have said it: a Mexican guy really was framed.    urlLink pictures (don't worry, just x-rays)
