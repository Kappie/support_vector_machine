Many stalls of food and stuff.. Its was noisy.   Had my warm up and went down for the 24 men heat 2.. we faced strong competition from safsa, ntu and other.. but nevertheless, we were told to do wat we are suppose to do.. if we beat safsa, we have a high chance of getting a medal. the honk was sounded and the race started off.. half way thru my sponge slipped of causing great difficulty to kick the boat and almost lost the oar to the waves as i hit the waves.. lucky i didnt.. or else there a chance of being dq. pulled away at maintance but was almost caught up at the last charge.. lucky we pulled away at the middle..  the girls came in second for 12 women and the yr 1 guys came in 3rd in their heats.. their timing was fastest 3rd, allowing them to enter the semi finals with us.  then came the 24 mixed.. i wasnt clinching to high hopes to this race.. ntu and many other strong teams had made my mind wander off for a while.. i was thinking if this is going down for fun.. but regardless of my previous thoughts i still believe i shld give in my 100% and yes i did.. surprising we pulled away again at the middle.. all thanks to laoshi's stroke and technique.. we came in first and entered the finals~!
