Only drawback is a red line they burn into the video about 1/3rd down from the top of the frame.  Here's your  urlLink one-stop source  for a lot of information on stop-motion in general.  And here's a  urlLink good source  that refers to Stop Motion Pro as long as other alternatives (many of them free).
