And undoubtly , Lindsay Lohan was drop dead gorgeous... It was a show abt these 4 teenage girls each having huge egos... How pathetic... Backstabbing each other and stuff... Each thinking they were that fucking pretty... LOL!Nice show... And they're called Plastics.  School was boring...It sucks so bad.(0_o)
