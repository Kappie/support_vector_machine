I wish I could use a different word, but they don't deserve it. Anyway, so this lady walked up to our table and quietly set her basket down and looked blankly at us. But she was pulling me, or I was pulling myself, so I got out my wallet and have her everything I had... And I picked one $1 bookmark and it read something. I cant remember what. Btw, this lady's got down syndrome. So anyway, I looked at this bookmark and said, ok... I like this one. But she took another one out of the basket and placed it on top of mine. Like she knew it was meant for me. Weird. It read, "don't tell a woman that you're unworthy of her love - she knows."  OH MAN!!! FREAKING LITTLE INDIA PARROT TYPE SHAT!!! I took it - needless to say.  I listened to Zel's voice 2 days ago over Joe's speaker phone as he spoke to her. I could have  cried. I miss her voice over the phone. She was nice. I tried calling her that night at home, but her maid picked up and tried to communicate to me that she'd gone to the clinic. I couldn't call back later. Next day I messaged her asking if she was ok and told her that I'd called. She killed me for calling, saying that she didn't want her parents to think that we were still together. However, she did acknowledge that she knew I cared. Well, that's enough for me. She told me never to call again.  Listening to her voice reminded me what I was around for. I'm going to get her back. It's just going to be a very long wait. Her having a crush on some jock and all. Good things come to those who wait, and fie to me for thinking about drug addictions.  I miss Hazel.
