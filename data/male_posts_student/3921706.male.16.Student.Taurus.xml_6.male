My moms decided to have a little get-together this weekend so I'm excited about that since me and all my friends get to hang out again before our summer excursions. And speaking of my moms, same old drama between me and her. Except she's upped the drama ante by talking about how ima cause her to have a stroke and put her in the hospital and stuff like that. I've just come to the realization that my mother and me are incompatible and the best way for us to get along is to say as less as possible.      And I'm not the only one who feels that way because, even though she thinks my other siblings are near-angelic, some of them are the ones that come and tell me things about my mother and we talk about how she is and her way of thinking and her whole mentality and how we know how to deal with her. She's never changed and she never will but she needs to realize that she's ever-so-slowly pushed her kids farther away from her and I'm next. We all love her and none of us want to say anything bad about her but....we don't have much good to say either. But I'm tired of stressing out over my mother and I'm just gonna let her be.      On the other end of my life, I hada certain dilemma involving my best friend and another "associate" of mine but with some advice from a friend and some own self-examination, I made a decision. Other than that, I've decided not to sweat the small stuff and just find pleasure in the simple things of life and enjoy the rest of my summer.      Oh yeah, and I'm only 1 away from 100 at Epinions and I'm so excited simply because I never thought I would stick with the site that long and I have so I'm proud and amazed. Now I just wish the eps members would stick with my reviews and not ignore the older albums I review while glorifying the newer ones. The caliber of each review is the same, I think. But beggars can't be choosers, right?        Current Eargasm---->     RES - "Tsunami"
