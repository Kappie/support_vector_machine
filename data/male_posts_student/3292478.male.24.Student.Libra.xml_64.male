Indeed the  urlLink Parliament TV  footage is currently (12.44pm BST) is focused in on the commons clock!)  Initial reports state that the gentleman concerned may have been part of the  urlLink Fathers 4 Justice  group. Given that, only a few weeks ago, Â£500,000 was spent on installing a glass screen with which to provide protection for members of the House of Commons this is going to be a great embarrassment to all concerned!
