Matt Jones and Brad Smith... their band, For What It's Worth.  Lots of fun, can't explain with words. So here's a photo of mine and Joanne's feet.       We had dual-iPods at one time, and yeah, it was great. I took around 300 photos and some movies. I uploaded most of the photos here:     urlLink  Check out the photos!      Sorry about the dodgyness of the gallery, it was the best I could do for now. Um, the movies will probably join the pictures soon, however not yet. I have a really funny video of Sian eating a sausage sizzle thing, and then I tell her I'm recording it, and her facial expression just changes from normal to  completely shocked  -- it's sooo funny.
