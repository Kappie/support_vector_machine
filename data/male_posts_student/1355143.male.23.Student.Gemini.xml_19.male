Special thanks goes to Tim and Ulli who both made me laugh very loud in this damned quiet norwegian PC-lab. In a PC-lab in Norway one is not supposed to talk or laugh, so everyone turned around and looked at me like if I was some kind of retard...   Yep yep, I hope everybody is still doing fine out there. As Ulli just announced, I'm going to China this sunday. It was kind of a funny story, because two weeks ago I got a phone call from a friend who is working there asking me whether I wanted to join him as an english teacher at Nanchang University in China. I thought aboout it for one day, because it would radically mess up all my career  plans, but the day after I called him and said: "Hell yeah, I'm going!" I considered it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I would regret my whole life if I didn't accept.   So now I try to get all the official papers in order before I leave to China next sunday. We're gonna go on holidays to a small island in the South-China Sea for 14 days before we head back to Nanchang and start teaching. I'm gonna be in charge of the oral english-classes, which means I have to try to get shy chineese girls and guys into talking english. It's gonna be quite a challenge but I hope that with great entusiasm and humour I can make it work. (do chineese have humour??)   I'll let you know how things are going when I come down to the land of the yellow people. Until then, keep writing folks! Love to hear from ya all...   Bye from the endless chilly rain in Bergen,    Vegard
