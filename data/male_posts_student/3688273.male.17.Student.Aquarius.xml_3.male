Saw Garden State tonight.  I really liked it, even if the ending was a little...Hollywoord?  The projector died about 3/4 of the way through the movie.  It was very strange but it did really make the audio sound really slow and low as it wound down.  Quite scary sounding, really.  I imagine Satan would sound a lot like that.  Somebody fixed everything with Fedora.  GStreamer now works and so does gnome-volume-manager, so I have sound from Rhythmbox and automounting of disks.  Sweet.  Also, found new themes I like.  They're so much more stylish than Bluecurve and less blinding than Industrial.  I hate being scared.  Not much really scares me except girls which is unfortunate.  I have a lot of girl friends but have never really had a girlfriend.  Tiffany and I talked about this a while ago and now she knows just how bad mixed signals can be.  So, Tiffany, I'm sorry for freshman year and hope you have better luck.  I've kind of given up.
