Was worth it, was in good company. -Got beaten up -Did not set foot in RadioShack today, even though I was in the mall -Was going to try and pick up waiter guy at Boston Pizza, decided not to toy with young boys hearts. -Played pool. Was good. -Supposed to do something with Kylie and friends on Friday (Halloween) night. Should be fun.  Good Nite.
