I also mentioned that the state of affairs was not likely to stay that way for very long. I was right. Thus begins...   THE SUCKENING   Thursday - I noticed that Sood, the Indi-cow of death is not in our department. I traverse to the fax room. She's there among the managers. I put two and two together and once again someone less qualified has been promoted due to their status as minorityfucktard. I become furious, natch. Later there is a managers meeting called. I attend. I'm sullen, but the only one smart enough with enough desire to answer the questions (Andrew's brighter than I am, but he has a thing about, well, speaking in front of people. Weird for a guy in his position). Brian asks me to stay after the meeting. He gives me a variety of reasons, but essentially he's telling me I'm...   being sent to the minors   Well isn't that dandy. See there's a smaller store just down the road. Half the traffic, half the money, nearly the same amounts of staff. Where I was at the time, well, I hated Sood, but that's not surpising considering her vocation of being St. Assgobler, Patron saint of being incredibly fucking stupid. But everyone else I got along with; Nick could be a prick and Rachel has a lisp that makes me want to make fun of her *all* *day* *long* (I didn't), but again, nothing as terminal as Sood, and even that wasn't that bad.  So I'm informed that my transfer is immediate, it's for my benefit and life in general will be better there. It's a little closer to home, Less highway more city (worse milage, fuckers) and higher traffic volumes when you break it right down. Taking into consideration traffic lights and controls, It takes me longer to get there than my old store.  Hence we return to   The SUCKENING   This store sucks. The manager's all right, but almost everything else about it blows. There's GG, the Grumpy Gus in my department who thinks' he's king shit since he's worked for the company since the dawn of time. Guess what fucknut - IT JUST MEANS YOU'RE A LIFER WHO HASN'T BEEN PROMOTED. He decided that it was high time we talk about procedure - with the hopes of indoctrinating me into his little click. I finally picked up a videocamera and re-arranged the uglier parts of his mug.  Well, that was the way it went in my head. I just nodded and glowered and shared a secret smile with the only one I had on my side today. Mike's a bit of a godsend. The Corporate Goon Squad(tm) as he has termed them irritate him just as much as me. Thankfully I've got him as a safety valve, that should reduce any Columbine-like incidents (it's a fucking small lunch room, wouldn't be much of a show).  The other girl (she shall remain nameless to protect my liability) I went to highschool with. Apparently I'm one of the few in town who hasn't known her in the biblical sense, and it really appears that GG wants to - that makes me chuckle - the futility of his desires illustrates the barren nature of the man's soul.    The store is small, and while prettier and better lit, is depressing. The corporate goon squad made me roll down my sleeves, though the AC is bust and button up my top button even though it looks rediculous. Nazis that focus on shirts - thus giving rise to the term, shirtNazis(tm). I used to work with one of the CGS(tm) at my old store - he's been working out since and now has a pair of tits that wouldn't be amiss in a swimsuit calendar - He, and his fucking aquiline nose (you know when *I* dis a nose it's got to be fucking GARGANTUAN - to ref some pop culture now, Hulk-like in nature) gave me the old rah rah you're a leader speech today.  I don't really give a toss.  After five years it's become apparent how very temporary this job is.   THE SUCKENING  shall return
