I find it appropriate, that as a SurvivorFire writer, I compare a few significant classmates to a few of our most loved, most hated Survivors. For your information, I got back my exam results today, and some more emerged as Fairplays, and even more dropped like flies. The first person I’m doing is a guy named Ashok. He sits right next to me, laughing his ass off all day. Any Survivor idiot can tell he’s playing the game, distracting others by ridiculing the teachers. Before the exams, he was on my Fairplay list, one that really had the potential to do well, but was valiantly concealing it. When the results were returned, he dropped to a John (Marquesas) Award. He definitely outwitted the “sheep” of the class, because a countless many fell into his laughing pit, but in the end he was completely outwitted by none other than me… There are 2 Fairplay award recipients, namely Jason and Anjan. Both play a very good game, and end up far, as in as far as top 5 in class. Both conceal their capabilities very well, playing the “I’m a doofus, don’t worry about me role.” What I know is that they definitely go home to mug their heads off. Personally I fell into Anjan’s trap at the start of the year, I thought he was a lazy pig who would couch up and do nothing at home. However sad for him, the Nurse John from above entirely spoiled his game. I got a lot of feed about him right before the exams, and I marked him on my list as a competitor. Jason, because of my past experience with him, I knew his bloody game plan. Sitting next to Ashok and Anjan, I knew I had no choice, I had to step up my game or be eaten alive. I used to be a Kelly W, having no game plan but to win, win and win all the bloody immunities. I knew that once I lost my grip I would go, right then, right there. I slowly converted into a Neleh… I let myself be used as a pawn. I let the 2 believe that “Hey, this guy is falling into my trap” he’s no longer a threat! Even though my test marks were still maintained, they no longer looked there… They only looked at how distracted I was… All I can say is: Wrong Move! Stupid, Stupid People!!  I know I’ve still got a lot of work to do… For all I know, I’m the one being outplayed! Now that they’ve seen through my bloody plan, maybe I just need a new alliance, maybe I need to be the new and biggest FAIRPLAY!  P.S. For those interested, I got 4 A1s and 4 A2s, that makes a total of Distinctions!
