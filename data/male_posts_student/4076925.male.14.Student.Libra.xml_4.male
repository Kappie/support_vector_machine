But actually it is really good, because I am going to a great High School and I can't wait to meet all my new friends, even though I am gonna miss my other friends like crazy, but unlike some of them, I have confidence our friendships will last.  I am still talking to people I have known and haven't seen in awhile, so I know things can work.  Today I have been reading Summer Reading like crazy!  And man, I am almost done with Cold Sassy Tree...then I have to read A Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (sorry all you conn. people about spelling conn. wrong).  Hopefully I'll be done with it all by thursday or Friday.  Then on Saturday I'll write my notes on the book...urgh the thought of it all...  Right now I am listening to a great band...The Killers.  I have only heard two songs, but I already love them.  They sing "Mr. Brighside" and "Somebody Told Me", those both are two of the greatest songs I have heard in a long time.  I already want their CD "Hot Fuss".  They are from the UK, so they have a British background and sound...so I like it all.
