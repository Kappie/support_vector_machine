I'm unlikely this year, the cellist who's going for it is supposed to be pretty professional. So, wish me luck for the impossible!  Laura isn't happy at the moment >_  Rachel is sooo not liking me at the moment. Seriously, looks thrown at me are eeeevil. Heh, I don't understand why, but each to their own. I guess not everyone can like me! But yeah, it's mildly disturbing. Her apparent hate of me is not improved by the fact she's one of the band's rivals for House Music O_O. Eep. You can see I'm not going to be the flavour of the month if we win. I was surprised to find that she could play the bass. I never should have been surprised, because she can't actually PLAY the bass, she can pick it up and hit the strings.  And I've decided that I'm going to put the Senior Drama Group in front of CAYO, and recieve the flak from CAYO for doing so. And if Matt Bick insults me for doing so, if anyone insults me for doing so, they will see what I'm like when I go over the edge. Seriously, DON'T FUCK WITH ME at the moment. I may be making important decisions about what I'm doing, but I'm making sacrifices, and I'm letting people down, and I'm feeling guilty. Don't mess with me now.  Along with that decision, I'm readressing the question of a few days ago. The question has once again come to mind, and another question comes with it; "Do I have too much to lose?".  I'm tired. I'm sleepy. I'm angry. I'm feeling guilty. I'm Jon.  Quote of the day: "Who am I? Can I condemn this man to slavery? Pretend I do not see his agony? This innocent who wears my face, Who goes to judgement in my place... Who am I?"  From   Who Am I?   From the musical   Les Mis√©rables   Love, Jon Roskilly
