Lately ive been pondering and things about random junk. Ive been getting through new versions of my bash script NixFo which is available @ http://atomix.wtf.la. Its in a large stage at the moment. Currently theres over 900 lines of code and counting. Ive been working on version 9.0 which will be released shortly. Its nothing too public. Only people who wanna get it that idle with me on irc are the ones who get it, otherwise anyone can just visit atomix.wtf.la and download it.  My main site has been down for almost a week due to the server rental's servers moved to a new location. Or in the process of moving rather. I dont mind though. Usually i go crazy over things like that. Just as long as i have a site. This is why i have at least 2 or 3. So i have the atomix.wtf.la page and this blog which is merely a personal object. A private object as well. If your reading this, and you know me, then consider yourself lucky. If your someone who knows me, dislikes me, and somehow stumbled here, then screw you.  Currently its about 6 am. I should be sleeping. I havent seen my tutor in 2 days which is extremely odd. I hope something didnt happen. I have this very very weird feeling in the back of my head that he called the cell phone, my dad answered, and said shit. I just have a strong feeling of that. Otherwise for all i know, something came up for him. Possibly he went on vacation, or possibly hes moving, or even possibly he wants to do something on his own time for the summer. I dunno, he would of called. Surely he would of. Makes me worry.  On IRC its been fine. Idling and chatting in the same chans. Apparently #blackhats has gone public and a lot of people have been joining. A lot of people that ive seen before but never got acquainted. The kinda people you wish you were friends with. I made peace with one or two. Theyre cool guys. Also #nixsec went public. The channel doesnt have a chan key anymore. A bundle of people came there too. Its all good. Just as long as no one fucks with anyone :).  My good friend will aka illwill from illmob.org setup a nice gentoo 1.4 box. Its nice for what it is. I used my NixFo tool and noticed that its an old box. Its statistics are worse than the one im currently on. It makes me think that i shouldnt take this one for granted, but it also makes me think i should buy some old computers like his 598 MHz PIII Coppermine and turn them into nice gentoo boxes. From the shell, these p3's on a cable is fucking slammin'. The only time i see a lag is like rarely. Everything is smooth, no keystroke lags, and everythings all good. Fast connection and its a smooth ride. Just as good as having the latest. The only difference is the hardware aspects. Less of a better video card, and sound card. But that means shit to me. I do everything by command line. I need no GUI =).  Gentoo by far is my favorite. The one thing that is great about it is its portability. Yes, there IS apt-get in debian, rpm in redhat and swaret in slackware. But the thing about Gentoo's portability is that it allows you to search the latest packages, upgrade em (which almost all do), but also receive the patches and its dependencies. If i didnt have that, id have to search 3000 miles over the net. But it all depends on what your attempting to install. Most of the time i know what to install, but when it comes to something i dont, Gentoo saves me the time.  I secured his box totally. Well, Gentoo kinda is already secure if you think about it. Its kernel has patches, and its a rarity for you to see a Gentoo advisory. If you look at secunia.com, you'll notice how Gentoo has only had about under 200 -- as i recall by memory -- advisories throughout the entire time secunia.com has been in existence -- which is awhile -- therefore you know its something worth having. And of course theres gonna be badmouthers saying its crappy. But its what you love. If you like an OS, then go for it. If you like a distro, then go for it. The only thing you need to worry about is your skill level within it. If you use windows, and someone says you suck for using windows and your a master at it, then thats something to be proud of for yourself. There is also the factor of your image, but if its what you like, then stick with it.  I myself love linux. I love windows too. Its kinda hard to not love windows when you think about it. Its just very easy to use. The thing that many people hate about it, is the fact that you cannot customize anything at all except visual settings and program configuration. Thats all you are allowed to do. It also has no development tools except third-party ones that you have to download and install. Its all a pain. Windows is more of a homey family kinda thingy or a kind of look at pictures, surf the web, talk to friends type of thing. Linux can be that and more. It lets you customize and it lets you do just about everything else. Basically its like having a Backbone PC. It comes with its defaults, and then you upgrade it. Windows is like buying a PC from a store. You cant customize it, its just there. And that is why i prefer Linux over Windows. Some people should think about that. Im no one to rant, im myself.  Oh look, my cute dog walked up to me and wants to sit on my lap. Im just gonna stay on for a little longer.
