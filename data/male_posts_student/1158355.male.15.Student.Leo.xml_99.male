Yes, then Friendly's. Next day, the 9th. I went to the movies with Jay H, Joe T, Nicole I, Laura C, Annabel W, and this other girl Jamie. We saw Pirates of The Carribean... Annabel and Jamie didn't sit with us because they didn't want to sit so close to the screen. We got there late so there weren't many seats left available. Well, good seats at least because two idiots decided to take up a row we needed. Nicole and I were cracking up at all the people randomly laughing in the movie. This one part, the person said "He's French" and this lady behind us starts cracking up. I thought he said "He flinched" which would definetly not make any sense to laugh at but I can see why someone would laugh at someone's nationality, especially French. But she must of been embaressed after everyone stared at her wondering what species she was. Oh well, there's always somebody that laughs at the French, god damnit I mean GOD I HATE IT ALL!!!! THAT COUNTRY!!! THE ART!!! THE GAY!!! THE LANGUAGE!!! THE ACCENTS!!!! THE HATS!!!! EVERYTHING!!! It's so horrible, it makes me tear sometimes. Ok then after the movies, I slept at Joe's. On the 10th, in the morning, I watched him play with his remote control car and he made me lay down and put a ramp next to me and flew the car right off the ramp soaring above my face. It was scary yet hilarious. This thing was loud and took gas, and it costed a lot of money. So I got to try it, and I'm a born driver... for remote control cars. I turned and stuff, oh it was great you had to be there. I think I hit a tire once or twice. Maybe a stop sign? Ok, so Joe let me borrow T2 so I know what the hell is going on in the third one which I must see very soon.  I left Joe's, then hung out with Laura. Then went to Keith's, played with him, Mike and Donyell??? I'll just say Doop. So me, Keith, Mike and Doop played Wiffel Ball... oh screw this I'll say Don. Then Mike had to go. Us 3 went in the hot tub, played 4 corners and bullshit. I won Bullshit amazingly without ever having to take the BS pile. My last 2 cards were a 5 and 8 and there was 3 of us so obviously that worked out good for me. After a million rounds of 4 corners, Keith and I decided, let's trick Don so we hid behind the tub, when he came up from the water he was like "GUYS? GUYS? UH...WHERE'D YOU GO"... when me and Keith bounced up on the count of 3 and screamed, he opened his eyes really quickly, didn't look at us, looked between us and screamed, it was hilarious. We also went in the pool and then back into the hot tub, the first time was orgasmic. In the pool it was hilarious because we played Around The World and Don was kicking ass. Then another funny thing, I versed Keith in Slugfest and my center fielder ran my himself to the backwall and just kept running into it. Keith slept at my house, we watched T2. On the 11th, today... well yesterday concidering I'm writing this 2 in the morning about. We went back to Keith's, hung out with Steve A. Then I went home because Keith had baseball practice. Then at night Keith and I, without Steve )= (because "he the rat") went to Sports Plus to hang out with some girls. Keith's girls, hehe I sat back, played arcades and got a huge audience by pounding the drums... it was exciting. I think everyone was just so relieved from the guy that played before me, he was old and he played like a 2 year old. He kept hitting the toms and the cymbals. I'm upset because they fucking took away my favorite song, Korn - Blind... well that was the only good song on the thing... or that I know. I sort of know Twisted Sister, I think from Justin but I forget what song they sing. 80's Rock... ok? ACDC, Guns N Roses, good but nothing beats Tool. Ok, so Keith brought me home, I watched the second half of Lord of The Rings with my mom and then I went to bed...well sort of... I wrote in this which took me about 40 minutes. Yep... that's it, the whole 4 days. Tomorrow who knows what I'm doing, some graduation parties, then Ashley's at night?
