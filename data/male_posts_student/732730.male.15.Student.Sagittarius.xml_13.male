I have no idea, really.   But, next week on Thursday I'm heading down Brissy way for a doctors appointment, and then to see Kieran. I'm scared... Things aren't exactely peachy between us, so what if he hates me? He rang me about an hour ago to see if this between us were ok, and he made me promise that they are. *tinkle* was the sound as a 5c coin went into the lie jar.  I mean, I love Kieran so much, but he's still trying to "Find himself" or what the fuck I think. Like, he's not sure if hes gay or not. He's had cock-in-ass plenty of times before, but why is he questioning it now? Maybe it's because he's a fuck-n-run type, and ain't ready for commitment. Or maybe he hasn't had any experience (like me) and is scared so is running away.   I'm so scared.  Meh, I should be doing German homework, but fuck that. I'm so over LOTE.   Sleepy time for me soon, I think...
