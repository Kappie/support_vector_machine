Strange things, these online diaries: Stunningly pointless, yet somewhow an intriguing look at people's ideas and lives. I alternately scoff at and am enthralled by people's blogs; everything from the most mundane, assinine musings, to pseudo-profound thoughts on the nature of the universe. Who knows. Maybe the meaning of them is in their open-endedness...Always changing, old thoughts forever receding into the past, new ones spilling out of the head and onto that lovelyinformation superhighway by the second. I really don't know, but I figured I would give this blog a shot, regardless of how the content will look in the 20/20 vision of hindsight.  So, this is the beginning. I have no clue how often I'll post, or what shape this blog will take in the future.I don't know how things will end up.However,aformat such as this teaches us, if nothing else, that the cliched saying holds true: The journey is more important than the destination.  I need to get something to drink.
