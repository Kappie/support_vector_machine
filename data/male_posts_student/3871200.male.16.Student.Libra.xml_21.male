The whole place was filled with ppl, saw tat she actually quite tanned, but her song's very nice. There's interaction with the audience as well. Took 50+ pictures but all very small leh, sit too far away liao. So few ppl go and get her autograph, like only less den 100 ppl, was thinking of buying her album for only $16, but no extra $ so didn't buy.     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink       Anyway, for the primer 2 thing, still not very much progress, hope can finish in time loh. I was beginning to think about wat kp said few days ago, renting a stall and sell things.
