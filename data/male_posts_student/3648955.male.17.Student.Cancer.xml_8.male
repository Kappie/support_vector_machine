I dont have much of a busy life, but ive been seeing my friends often, and ive been doing a bit of coding lately. During the past 6 days, a few things have happened. Nothing special, just going out. Yesterday my friends came over for awhile. Me and Belle had gone to Austin Street just to browse around, but decided to go to Barnes and Noble. We were there for at least an hour and a half looking around. Finally we go on the line, she bought a book and i bought scrabble, because the book(s)  i wanted were $14.00 each, and i only brought $29 with me.    Today i was supposed to get tutored but my mother is being a cheap asshole and apparently my education isnt worth anything at all. Great mother.    Yesterday i got a really cool electric trimmer, its from BrAun, it was only $16.99 + tax. I like it a lot. At first, i thought it was just a trimmer rather than just a shaver and i ended up shaving off my beard, it looked horrible so i just shaved it all off including the stash.
