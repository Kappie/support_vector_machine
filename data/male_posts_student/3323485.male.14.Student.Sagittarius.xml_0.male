When you look through the blog listiogs, and you see Peter Ooms' Weblog, did you click on me because you liekd the name?   ive just noticed something...ive had no effect on anything. if i was never born, the only differences would be a couple of schoolbooka and this blog wouldnt be here. holy s**t now I really am depressed. im just off to do some homework. might aswell kill myself for all the dofference it would make to everyone elses life.
