What won't be good, however, is tomorrow is Blue Team's last update. I'm kinda bummed out about that.   My essay didn't take that long to revise, so I was pretty homework free tonight. I did FST in English, because I did English in APUSH. I really hope that we are done watching movies in APUSH. I thought it was going to be fun, and I just don't have the patience to watch movies on a May afternoon.   I don't really know where I fall in Houley's Liberal spectrum. I dislike George Bush, but I'm not a Bush-hater. I don't know what the "Rebel" has to do with it. I don't back things up with "facts" because you can prove anything with a statistic. Schilling takes something off an obviously biased website and passes it off as fact. Well, I could go to a liberal website and grab some facts too. I seriously think I could win most debates with a reasonable conservative (read: someone who actually listens) because I am a hardcore news junkie. I read the newspaper every day, watch the news every night, and spend about an hour a day on a bunch of news websites. I would like to stop but it really irks me when someone talks about a current event and I don't know what is going on. But enough about politics from me for now.   It hasn't hit me yet that school is almost over. It hasn't sunk in that in a week, I'll be done with school and have 90 lovely days away from the boring mass of hypocrisy that is BHS.   Baccalaureate last night was kinda fun. It was cool playing around with the headsets. Plus, I had the easiest job.  Went downtown today to do a standup for TV Pro. I did some pretty retarded things in Fishhead TV Pro, but this was waaaay stupider. Which reminds me, I have to go back to TV Pro. to work on my package in a while.  I like downtown. It seemed like my teammates didn't really know their way around downtown, but I do. Man, I love downtown. You have your legitimate, respectable stores on one block (Coco Moon, Northwind, Bridge, etc.), and then you go a block over and everything is just scummy bars and pawn shops. My uncle used to own Tropical Nights and that seemed like a seedy place. I know I wouldn't ever want to be in there at night, because it always seemed to me like a place for guys who wore their hats backwards and listened to Goat music would go. Still though, every couple weekends we hit Honest George's and then go wander around downtown.   Now that Garage Sale season has started, me and Chris will probably spend the next 3-4 Saturday mornings hitting every Garage Sale in the Brainerd Lakes Area.   I like how this blog is growing. Bryce said he wanted to get in on the action, and if you know anyone else, post so.  I am working on a end-of-year type retrospective for the blog, so maybe you guys could make one too and we could put them together? It would be cool to put them all on one post so email yours to me at badreligion015@hotmai.com
