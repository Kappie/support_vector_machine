I wanted to make a collage and after two hours of cutting out pictures I realized my idea didn't come together in a way I wanted.  So when I went to Anita's party it was on my mind the entire damn time.  I couldn't think straight and was pretty on the edge because of that I guess.  I guess that and the sugar is what made me so jittery to the point where people jokingly asked if I was high.....  Whatever.  More funny stuff.  Kim seems to have some sudden dire hatred of me.  That's perfectly fine, but she seems to be more blunt towards me suddenly.  I guess not talking to a person really can get them pissed at you months later.
