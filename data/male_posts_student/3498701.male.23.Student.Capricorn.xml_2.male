She makes me more aware of my inner feeling. I became sensitised by the presence of it deep inside and i am glad. I am awakened. I can imagine my inner self stretch and yawn... shaking its head, opening its eyes sparking with wits and giving a very cunning and naughty smile. This will be the first step where I grow  exponentially.   Watani came to my room not long ago. Last night, She asked me whether i could drive her to uni today if it rains. I told her i will drive her IF IT RAINS. She agreed and said that if it does not rain today she will walk to uni. Well, just now when she was in my room, not only she "ordered" me to photocopy some stuffs for her, she also asked me to drive her to uni despite of the sunny day. She said she is lazy. Well, the car is lent to Louise, so even if i want to drive her i cant. But, I should have told her first and foremost that she should walk as it didn't rain. Instead I told her that the car is not with me. I can see clearer how my friendship with annabel is so superficial and lack compassion. It is always me showing her care and helping her out of shits, she has never reciprocated at all, not at all. It's not that i am giving expecting something in return, but the fact that this has gone too far. It is true sometimes even without saying, that sometimes i can imagine that i am turning into her dog. agreeing to every request of her. The inner self has awakened, it is struggling through all these injustice. something has to be done. In the meantime, i will concentrate on my work. I must score!
