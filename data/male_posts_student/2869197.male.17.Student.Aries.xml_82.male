Well, as you may have guessed, the book was about a vampire. Pretty twisted stuff, IMHO. Interesting views of detachment, sensation, and morality. In the context of this book, I think of myself as a vampire. I'm detached and far from real humanity. I see horrors or beauties and feel little if anything. And evil. Such evil I have done, but I won't be telling. It wasn't terribly illegal though.  With my mental pysche appeased, let's turn to my auditory indulgences. While I've bought several new CDs, what I'm really listening to now is the soundtrack of  The Matrix: Revolutions. Damn it's good. The lead singer of Hives once said that good rock is only sung in english. I reply that good classical music is only sung in anything but english. I'm not sure what Neodummerang is sung in, probably Hindi since it quotes the Upanshanids. But whatever it is, it's freekin' good. Buy this CD. No money? Sell your children, or steal one and sell him. *sigh* This CD reminds me why I like classical. You just can't get that mental rush from other genres.  We're babysittinga small boy named Riley. By "we" I mean Kristen. I just love his blunt, innocent comments on life. He said I look like a girl (long hair) and I had a very messy room (self-explanatory). Ah, for such youthful exuburence. Wait, no, I don't want it. I like being tall and cynical of humans. It's more fun.
