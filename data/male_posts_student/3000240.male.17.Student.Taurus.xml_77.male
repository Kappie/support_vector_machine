It's not your right either to say who can post what and what about. Even when Dean was being an ass on this site, he still had the right to speak his mind, and no one could deny him that.   I realize I'm not Gods gift, unlike yourself "luv", and If I thought I was then I'd be a million times more different to what I am.  Now I'm not saying that I totally agree with either being a townie or a grundger on here, but I would not call grundgers cowards, just because they won't fight other people. Fighting has never been a way to earn respect, its only ruling by fear and intimidation, and as townies are for no reasons what so ever picking on grundgers etc, what is there crime by speaking there mind on here about it and for sake of argument even if it was, would that be a worse crime than violence against anyone?   Surely if your as open minded and non-judgmental as your coming across there, then you would have realized what I was saying by now was true, and you would now give up arguing with your pitiful grammar, go away, and of this site."
