I totally redid  urlLink fansites  last night, I completed and uploaded the  urlLink Rei listing , made a form for people with OE and told people who don't have OE to email me, and generally was productive in the web stakes. However, I have discovered that there is already a fanlisting for Rei on Fanlistings.org so I'm not going to get on there. Booger. But, I'm still on at Fansites. No-one can take me off there. Or if they try I can do nasty things to them using sporks.  Sam's back from Greenbelt and Brownie camp etc. so woooo her. I'm not a great person for not waffling on, so I'll endeavour not to, but she's back, so... kind of yay. Everything seemed quieter while she wasn't here.  I didn't realise we went back next week, I thought it was the week after... that's 2 years in a row I've done that. Meh, it's just because if I had my way we WOULD have a week more. Not just because I'm wrong. Noooooooo.  Anyway, my blog @ and-then is not looking like it'll be finished within the week, but we live in hope. Have a good afternoon.  Love, Jon Roskilly
