I feel like going on a run or something like that, I can't run good at all though :( so maybe I'll just go for a walk somewhere... Possibly town? I don't know maybe I'll call Courtney and see what's up, we could do something maybe I don't know.... Well I'm really bored to sum things up for today, I haven't really done anything too interesting, but you know what? It's all good because I got Simple Plan blaring in my ears right now, nothing gets better than this!
