The weird thing about my friends is that they all hae one thing in common.  They all seem to be losers also.  It seems that ever person I make friends with just happens to be a loser like me.  When most people makes friends they usually become friends with their friend's friends also.  In my case, I am my friend's friend.  Everybody that I know seems to be a loser.  It's like one big loser network.  Maybe losers are just attracted to me, or maybe I'm attracted to losers.  Maybe all losers are attracted to each other.  Maybe it's a government conspiracy, or it's just in our genes, or we have some unknown force that pulls us all together, who knows?  Gets you thinking, huh?  Well, not really I guess... maybe it's just me.  Maybe I just have way too much time to think.  Damn, I need a hobby.  Oh, by the way, everything I said here only applies to everyone except  Lisa .  "Why not  Lisa ," do you ask?  It's because  Lisa  is cool.  How can  Lisa , who's so damn cool, be a loser?  She just can't.  P.S.  Lisa  is cool!  - Some loser   "The path that we take is not right, it is simply the path that we choose." -Anonymous
