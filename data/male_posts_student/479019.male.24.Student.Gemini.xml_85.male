I've been dreaming a lot lately of people I know... but don't know really well... they're mostly background characters, but it's kind of interesting.  Well anyway, it's the start of a good weekend for me. Sure I've got work tonight and tomorrow morning, but I've got some fun plans. I'm going to a film festival with my lady friends from Cambridge and I'm seeing the  Hives  Sunday night.  In other music news, I ordered the imports of  Weezer 's  Maladroit  and  Bad Religion 's  Process of Belief  last night. That was about $60... but oh well... I'm a big fan of the two bands so it's worth it.  In rotation right now is some  One Man Army .  ***
