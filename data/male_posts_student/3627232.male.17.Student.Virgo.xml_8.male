How will it end? Such thoughts a mind can't mend, For to know such things can not be done We are beings of leisure, we must have fun Let philosophers worry of such things For they are the "enlightened" human beings.  But yet I can't help it, I must know When we all die, where do we go? Is it a moment when we feel much joy? Or do we become some sick god's toy? It's to much for my mind to bear Yet deeper I think, why do I care? I have life to live, I should explore There are many things behind every door Yet here I sit, I ponder and ponder, Constanly thinking, always I'll wonder.  Philosophers keep thinking, and what for? To have a poster put on someone's door? Life is to be lived, not put into text One writes a book and what shall come next? Fanaticism, and irrational thought Often that is sadly the plot We have come so far, but where have we gone? Plans of war, battle and conquest are drawn They say it's necessary, it's what people need Are they so blind to their own greed?  There is no perfect way I'm afraid So I shall remain here in the shade For I am a being of leisure, it's what I do I refuse to deny it if that is what's true I'm not lazy, I just often wonder And so I lay here and ponder Never will I be able to conclude Why it is we have this mortal feud And soon enough, I'll have forgot Everything that came to me at this spot.
