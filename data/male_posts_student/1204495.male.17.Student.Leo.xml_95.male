I suppose you could say that i'm too young or too neieve (is that how you spell it?) might as well concentrate on producing 'legalkly bloated' i'm sure that it will pass the time, it will probabaly take my mind off the whole matter, i should of kept quiet, i should of just stuck to dannys lvoe life, i should never of fallen off my bike because now my hand is hurting :( maybe i should just move to poland, it would be better for all off us, might go for a walk round poynton pool tomorrow after i've done my papers, or i might go on firday, yes i'll go on firday its easier that way, it can give me inspiration, a nice time to just sit and think, its a rather good place for doing that, midn you thats all i did in school, sit and think, meh if it was time for college i'd at least have my mind taken off everything thats gone on in my life. I just don't know what to do anymore :(. Its true, she said it'd never work, i mean shes from a 'upper class' part of society i'm form 'middle class' part of society, it would never work out, no point in evn trying, wasno point in telling aneesah when she asked me, might as well just have a think, might a well go back to my old self, might as well go back in time and wish this whole sorry affair had never been given a chance to get out, its my own fault, i should never off gotten so 'big headed' about it, i should never of told danny, though to be fair to him he hasnt told anyone, that i know off, maybe i should just go back to writing pointless stories and producing pointless films, i'll go back to my old slef, if i can or should i do what my grandpa told me to do in that weird dream? i dont know anymore, tis is the time when i need my grandpa, he always knew what to do, shame hes dead :'( not really told anyone about how i feel about that, meh no-one would be interested anyway, i just usually listen to other peoples problems, no-one really thinks i have a problem, not that i do, i just bottle all my emotions up and it all ends like this  :( maybe i shouldt be so kind to people, maybe i should never of got messenger, then none of this would of ever happened, i just dont know :( what should i do? i've helped many a people with their problems, i've helped alice with all her problems and worries, maybe i shouldnt of, maybe i should of never added her to my contacts, i should of just stayed being anti-alice, i should never of added her, tis my own fault, like half of the problems i cause, tis my own fault, i guess i was more of a burden for various people and a good friend to various other people, i dont know, poland seems like a good place to go to clear my head, wish i could go there now, someone take me away to poland, failing that i'll go to poynton pool or up to higher poynton, lovely tranquil place, might drag danny there on friday or might go on my own, i shouldnt be so nice to people, maybe this is a good time to go to bed, i dont know anything anymore :(
