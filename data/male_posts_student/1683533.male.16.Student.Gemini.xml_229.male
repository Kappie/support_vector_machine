As a matter a fact, you their new cd is coming out Sept 21, and they will hit the radio this Tuesday august 3rd!  I really missed those guys...That was the second concert I went to, the Pop Disaster tour with Green Day and Blink 182.  And of course I lost my concert virginity to Weird Al.  haha.  Well, from the sounds of the music snippets they sound like the true blue pop punk songs like Green Day always stuck with.  For more visit their  urlLink site , which will be changed into a new one in a few days.
