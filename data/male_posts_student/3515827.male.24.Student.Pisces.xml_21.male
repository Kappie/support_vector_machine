I almost like movie trailers better than actual movies.  So right now I like watching  the  trailer for the movie  Garden State .    I got a little nancy drew (not hard, when you have ye olde internet) and deduced that the two songs in it are  Such Great Heights  by The Postal Service and  Love Will Come Through  by Travis.  They would make such good background in the trailer for the movie about my summer of 2004.  For lack of such a movie, I am playlisting them for a CD that I will make for the aforementioned boy I have a crush on.  Speaking of which, I'm sick today and he came to visit me.  I'm about 3 seconds away from falling in love, but I'm holding back because I'm too afraid of the consequences.  More about this at my  other  blog.
