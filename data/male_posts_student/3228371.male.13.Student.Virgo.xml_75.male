Sally is just so blah! This is what Wilfred said in his blog:   alot ALOT of people asked me if bestfriend and kt was going out... there was so many people asking and sticking their noses up it that it was starting to get annoying... WHAT DO YOU ALL CARE ABOUT? // what u gonna tell me ur her friend? LOL weren't people like bsing about kt and how bad she was and blah blah blah.. // but u all care about her... // o ic.. how ironic... // Smart move using my kai mui to check up on the stuff... lol please don't use her like that...   So I'm just like... wtf?! Okay, first of all SALLY was the one nosing about Katie and Nathan going out. She told Wilfred that she was finding out for a friend or something and INgrid an dI are like: *smacks own forehead* Smart move. We didn't want Sally to go find out for us and now Wilfred thinks we used his "kai mui" whose also known as Sally, to find out for us. What the fuck?! See the cockiness?! What is up with that?! Sally asked him, not us! We don't give a fuck anymore if Nathan and Katie are going out! Yeah, everyone's bitching about Katie because everyone hates her, but Wilfred stands up for her so much. I'm just like WTF?! I don't think they've seen the bad side of her yet. I don't care if they get hurt by her because I honestly think they deserve it for being so close-minded about everything. In my opinion, he's always doing what he "THINKS IS RIGHT" but he never is. I wish he'd just stop this bullshit and ditch Katie. He's blocking out everybody including Sally just for Katie. What the fuck?! Who does he think we are?! Evil backstabbers that use friends for gossip?! Ingrid and I don't give a fuck anymore about Nathan and Katie and he thinks we still do! All Ingrid and I wanted was to be cool with Nathan and Wilfred again and just be good friends. BUT Sally had to be so blunt and bring it up so now we're in "hot water" with them again. (quoted in a way from Ingrid... modified wording) Geez, I'm not telling Sally anything ever again. Untrustworthy. I just wanted to be really good friends with Wilfred again... but things keep happening and I think I'm just gonna give up on trying to grasp onto this chance to become good friends again... I mean, from what I hear he supposedly still has feelings for me and I guess there's no way that I can become close with him again without going out with him again... which isn't going to happen because I love Nima and not him. Despite his cockiness and bitter shell, I know that he's a good guy. After our break up he just toughened up because he felt as if he got struck down... he's trying to put his guard back up so that he won't get hurt again... but sometimes that wall he put up... is too hard to get through to be friends again... I really valued his friendship. It's a shame to lose it. He was a really cool person when I first met him. Peace-crazy guy... funny, cool, friendly, outgoing... after all that, he's just... cold, bitter, hard, uncaring... I don't like it.  Hmm, Nima said he'd call after 5 minutes... *sighzZ* I miss him. Well, whatever... Hmm, POP this Friday for Bethel. I hope we're doing something cool. They're not gonna tell us! NOOO! Haha! At least tell us if we need to bring bible! Oh well! I'm gonna go now. I wonder if Nima's even gonna remember to call back. Oh well... whatever. It's 10:40 or whatever now... it says 10:40 on my computer but 10:30 on my watc. Whatever. Round it of and you've got 10:35. Big difference. Anyway... I'm off... don't know if Nima's gonna actually call back. Hope so... I don't think he will though. Whatever... bye.
