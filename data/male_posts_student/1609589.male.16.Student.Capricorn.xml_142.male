I don't want to have anybody else listen... not yet, anyway.. .not till i perfect it... That's why I'm glad when I get the house to myself. I'd say I was okay at the dulcimer, and good with the drums, but it feels awkward when my parents come in and say how good i did, they were hearing my little jam session. I need a drumset... and to burn down my next door neighbor's house and build a room for myself... where I can just go and not be disturbed... Sometimes I need some time alone...
