It is my attempt today to separate the facts from the fiction, but you never know. I may one of them myself! Hahaha, sureeeeeee.   Lets start with the facts eh? ‘Illuminati’ means “The Enlightened Ones” and is thought to have been established in the 1500’s, in Italy. During that period, scientists were being prosecuted as heretics by the Church, and so the scientists had to find a way of communicating their ideas to each other without the risk of being discovered. One of the known Illuminatus, and apparently one of the most influential, would be Galileo Galilei ( urlLink http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei ). Despite covering their tracks well, they eventually fled Italy, fearing that the Church (the big brother of the 16th century) was closing in.   This marked the end of the Illuminati dedicated to science, and started the anti-Christian Illuminati. The Illuminatus that fled Italy joined ranks with mystics, prophets, and the like, who had all themselves been declared heretics. Regardless, the Illuminati were deemed Satanic by the Church, called Shaitan (meaning adversary in Islamic, and being the root word of Satanic). So you see, the term Satanic means different things in different times. Regardless, the Illuminati maintained their name, and became considered one of the most powerful anti-Christian groups around, and a threat to the Church.   Despite assimilating such members as the alchemists, the Illuminati found refuge with the Freemasons (another secret society which isn’t as covert and maintains life to the present day). The Freemasons let the Illuminati into their lives, and eventually became used. Now, understand this, their have been Freemasons in seats of power for quite the while. Before I continue, I’ll name some so you can understand the power that the Illuminati potentially possessed. George Clinton (third American president), George Washington, Benjamin Franklin (one of thirteen Free Masons to sign the American Constitution), Franklin D. Roosevelt (32nd president of America), Colonel Harland Sanders (KFC), and many, many more. The last I added in as a joke, but he was a Freemason. Anyways, though we know Lucifer to be the devil (as dictated by the Church), the real meaning of Lucifer is “Bringer of light”, which can be summarised in the word “Illuminator”. They intended to bring the world under “New World Order”, using a principle called the Luciferian Doctrine.    Anyhow, you can see that at one time or the other, the Illuminati had the power that it is often credited of having nowadays. I’ll explain why they don’t in the fiction. Next paragraph please.   Look on the American dollar bill; see the pyramid with the eye? This is the biggest argument that conspiracy buffs focus on when they tell you that the Illuminati are taking over the world, because this symbol is the Illuminati symbol. What they don’t tell you is that the pyramid, which is uncapped, is a symbol of a nation which has not yet fully grown, whereas the eye is an ancient representation of spirituality. Despite this, there are beliefs that Franklin pushed this idea with the subtle help of the Illuminati, but this goes proof less, and means jack squat.   You know, looking at these theories sickens me, so I’ll let you look  urlLink http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/ritual_abuse/53556    And I’m getting lazy, xD.    Post Note : Arty’s going to be angry at me for getting lazy
