While packing someting into my cupboard, i found an old key-chain that my ex-gf gave me last year. If u guys have noticed, novelty shops have been selling those kind of de-stress keychains where u squeeze the keychain and someting will pop out from the holes, and my ex-gf got me the pig keychain, where u squeeze the piggy and shit pops out from his asshole.. Haha, and i left it in my cupboard for so long it became like tis..     I guess i left tis piggy in the cupboard for so long and did not squeeze him to help him clear his bowels, he cant take it, and crapped himself, haha.. Look! He's smiling, he has finally relieved himself, LOL  Had a good dinner with my mum's very own bbq chicken wings, it has been a long time since i ate my mum's cooking, been eating my grandma's cooking all this while, and my grandma's fav dish? EGGS! Steam eggs, fried eggs, egg soup, boiled eggs, and the list goes on.. I cant stand eggs! I tink i had been eating eggs for at least three days a week! Damn, i tink i've got egg-phobia already..  Oh well, work again tomolo.. Sianz.. Sorry again, piggy..   Current Mood: Bored Current Music: D12 - My Band Current Underwear: Boxers
