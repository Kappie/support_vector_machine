I will go to Paris and some cities in Italy from July 14th to July 24th. I have ordered plane tickets. It can be a big adventure for me and my mother. All together is 10 days. Sorry to Romain that I have no time to visit you because of my tight schedule and budget. Hope you have a nice summer with your family.
