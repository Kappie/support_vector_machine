It implies that there are rules, and that those who donâ€™t abide by them are somehow in error. Or even  wrong . Perhaps you wonder how I can be so sure of myself, so convinced that my way is the best. Or maybe you just hate me for my grammatical, syntactical arrogance. In such cases, I do have one thing to say:  It sure feels good being right.
