I'm doing one of the solos in The Holly And The Ivy for the carol concerts, and I'm doing the 3rd reading in one of them. So go that.  The band has 2 gigs this week; tomorrow and Sunday. ARrrrrrrrrrrrrghifarghy. If you add coursework into the equation... much to do about much.  I'll try and post again later, but I'm  a bit stocked-up at the moment.  Love, Jon Roskilly
