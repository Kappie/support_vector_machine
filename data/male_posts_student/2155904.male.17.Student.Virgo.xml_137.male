But the thing is, when Tyke has a really good blog day he is in the worst mood to do the blogging.  Tiredness and varying moods are the two main contributors to this feeling.  It's kinda funny though how Tyke really isn't that tired right now.  He was sorta quasi-tired at Dotti's tonight but he just felt like closing his eyes a lot and not really opening them.  But let's go back.  Tyke got up and hung out with himself all day downstairs.  Watched some TV, played some games, didn't do some Physics.  Ya know, just cool stuff.  Then at 5 he left for Dotti's where some people met up for dinner for part IV or so of Purdy's birthday bash.  Tyke drove with Tina and Tig as they went to California Pizza Kitchen.  It was fun and good.  Then they went back to Issaquah and picked up some more people before heading off to Renton for broom ball.  It was wicked fun.  It is a really cool game.  You play on an ice rink with a ball a little bigger than a softball and this stick that has a weird pointed plastic end to it so it is a little like a shaved broom.  Then you just run around on the ice trying to score.  And you fall a lot.  But Tyke only fell twice he thinks.  Once he just fell on his knees and that hurt a little cuz ice is hard and the other time he just kinda wiped out but his hands sorta got scraped because of the ice.  But considering, he hardly ever fell.  He was a very good defensive player in his mind.  Offense wasn't his game.  Defense was.  And he was a damned good goalie.  After the game they went back to Dotti's and watched When Harry Met Sally.  That part wasn't that fun but it was cool being with Dotti (who finally asked Tyke to tolo today just to let you know).  So that is great.  But yeah, just so that you know what Tyke is talking about, Tyke is looking forward to college and new experiences more and more.  Cuz lying on the ground by yourself isn't fun.  Lying on the ground with Dotti is fun.  Alone is not.  You know where this goes.  Nothing that hasn't been said before.
