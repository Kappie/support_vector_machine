In Israel they find to their dismay that they were brought to a fledgling city in the Negev (a scarcely populated desert in south Israel) and are doomed to physical labor and living with neighbors who share the exact same story besides alterations of date and country of origin.  The harsh existence is weakened by the fact that Sara finds a friend in a Moroccan teenager-Nicole (Neta garty in an unforgettable performance) that, by the influence of her extrovert widowed aunt, rebels against the conservative values of her mother (Ruby porat shoval) and the constant nagging of her terrified, soon to be married and more than slightly overweight sister (Rotem Abuhab).  Sara and Nicole's friendship is put to a harsh test amidst the tumultuous times of puberty, the frustration of being stranded in forgotten province and certain, hmmm..., morally challenged entanglements (which I Can't reveal here)  The only thing that changes the mundane routine of the town is the arrival of the British Cricket team who comes to play against the Israeli team which consists of Indian retirees and, due to shortage of able Israeli Cricket players, Moroccan immigrants who play the game with zeal and vigor despite the fact that they have absolutely no idea what this game is about (and I don't blame them).  This film is of course not about Cricket, moral values or teenage rebel. Its about the clash of mild mannered Indians with outgoing and zealous (over zealous at times) Moroccan immigrants and how it deeply affects the lives of two female teenagers that out of the common search for reason in this age, form a genuinely deep bond. --Eyal philippsborn   Jerusalem, Israel
