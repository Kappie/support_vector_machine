Garbage *Jared falls into coma* Its version 2 Pretty awesome, not as good as the tracks that i have from beautiful garbage yet, still good though  Britney Spears Oops... I did it again Old school pop, and mick liked the cover art.  John Mayer room for squares not bad, kinda boring though.  Hit Machine 18 absolute shit, boring no decent songs. waste of time etc  Placebo - without you i'm nothing not my type of music, the bitter end had more of a dance edge and that was what i was expecting
