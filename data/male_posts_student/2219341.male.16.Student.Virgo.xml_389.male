COVER YOURSELVES PLEASE !  i honestly find none of that attractive.  what i  do  find attractive is a girl that respects herself enough to cover herself.  a girl that knows about this little thing called  MODESTY !  now thats hot.  all this stuff... porn, movies, clothing.  its all based on this sexual thinking that this world is tryin to shove down our throats .  its all this lust.  and its sick.  so do yourself a favor.  just say no.
