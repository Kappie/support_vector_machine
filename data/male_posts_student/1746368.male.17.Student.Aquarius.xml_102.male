Yum, I am drinking some strawberry milk. Strawberry milk is yummy. I am so bored right now, nobody is online, and if they are online they are away.   We were having some problems with some guy who decided to take a whack at the Christian faith. Luckily he never hit here. He would have been out of this place when he started posting as "~Jesus Christ~". We tried to be nice to him. We tried giving him a chance, but he did not want to submit. He visited our site, we never came to his. He cannot come back to four of our five sites (this is the only one he can come to). If you want to look at the things he has said visit  urlLink The Brit Pit ,  urlLink Mike Speaks  or  urlLink Four Cool Guys .  One could search, but never find someone as awesome as her. Well that's all for now. I shall be going.
