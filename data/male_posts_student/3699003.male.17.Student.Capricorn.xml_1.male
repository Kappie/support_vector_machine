Then again, worship shouldn't always be so up in the air. Needs to come down once inawhile.   I GOT THE CORN MAZE JOB!! WOOT WOOT! Found out yesterday. Was told that I did an excellent job on my interview on Monday. Looking forward to starting next Wednesday at 2:00 for orientation (even get to work a little bit and help set up.)  My tooth hurts like crazy.. wisdom tooth coming up and hurting like mad! GRRRRS  So now that I have a job, I guess the only other thing I could need is... a girlfriend.. haha hehe hoho.. no.  Gonna go play RCT or UT or C3.. something of the sort
