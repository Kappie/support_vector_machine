I realized that it is very dumb for me to take presents before christmas because I opened two gifts and Im really spoiled so Im used to getting lots of stuff. Last year I got a drum pad and a TV and stuff. This year though was really memorable because first of all we are at a really nice resort and second of all knowone was down. In our family at least 5 have died in this month resently so for knowone to be is sad is very good. The only thing that sucked is that my momma was really sick. So when she was opening gifts she would laugh and almost cough op a longue but she will be fine. Me and my sis are the only ones here because we happen to be the only minors and the only ones not at the casino but anyways including presents that I got earlier I got  Laptop(YAY!!!) Music Studio Recording System For Comp Shoes(Nice KSwiss) 2 Wal Mart Gift Certificates $100.00, $60.00 (I know I know walmart but trust me imma come up) $50 biological father $20 brother all in all not a bad christmas   I like I like now im gonna go shoppin with Chels for BD in January
