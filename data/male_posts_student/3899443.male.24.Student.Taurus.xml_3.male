Opening a box I noticed it was a book entitled   urlLink The Signature of Jesus   by  urlLink Brennan Manning  (who is probably most famous for his book   urlLink The Ragamuffin Gospel . ) I asked my supervisor if this was a new book by Manning.    "No, it's an old book. They just put a new cover on it, and the sad thing is that a lot of people will see the new cover, think it's a book of Manning's they haven't read and buy it."    "That sounds a little sneaky for the Christian publishing world," I countered.    She laughed. And she kept laughing. Eventually, she stopped. "So young and so naive," she said.    This is what makes me mad about Christian publishing - they are all a bunch of liars. They claim to be about something bigger than themselves (or as Manning's publisher says,  urlLink "That's why we're here -- tochange lives for the glory of His kingdom." ), and yet they are all about the money. They even stoop to re-covering books so the idiot public will buy them a second time.    I'm not saying being in business to make money is wrong. But when you represent yourself as someone working for the glory of God, using underhanded tactics to turn a buck seems highly inappropriate. It's not like they're televangelists.
