I met a pretty cool guy yesterday, he came in the store looking for diamonds for his new bride. He was wearing a Hot Water Music shirt so I started talking to him about all kinds of stuff. Maybe I will run into him again. His name was John and he was mosdef on the level. I should have invited him out for a beer, unless he was EDGE.  I started complaining about the lack of inspiration and intelligent conversation. Grant it, I talk with mimi all the time about stuff and that is perfectly satisfying for the most part, but I could use some connections. Obviously the people I work with now cannot put me in contact with anyone hiring IT pros.  We are getting a new manager at Zales, his name is Dwight and he is a fucking dork ass mofo. He is moving from Las Vegas to manage the store and he is a dork ass mofo. Oh, I said that already. Slicked back blonde hair that is going bald in the back, a molestache, glasses, and he was wearing a TAN blazer with his grey pants. I dunno, that just seems odd. He looked like a fucking used car salesman.   Well, tomorrow I am heading to Lodi, taking some laundry with me and heading up into the mountains for some fun. I wonder if mimi's mom is going to go? That would be interesting. Her flight arrives tomorrow.   current mood:  melancholy current music: pedro the lion
