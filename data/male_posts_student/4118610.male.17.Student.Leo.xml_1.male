It will never run away, it wont die in your lifetime, and if it gets hit by the car, it will be fine. It will be a child's best friend, because it can tell how a person is feeling, and it is extremely intelligent. To sum it all up, the Telepathic Tree makes the perfect friend and companion. Unfortunately, as you may be able to see from this high tech computer simulation, there are still a few bugs to work out. But more funding will solve all those minor problems.  urlLink
