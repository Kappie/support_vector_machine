Mr. Kew has been put on probation (whatever the hell thats supposed to be, seriously what are they gonna do? make him stay at home while getting the same pay?!). There is a petition going around to get the teachers reinstated. Contact me if you want to sign the petition. I mean seriously, it wasnt the teachers that did the hazing, it was the other athletes that were doing it. WTF is this shit. Well all the football coaches have quit already, so hah. no changed in the football coaching staff. but if you are doing any of the other sports, there is a chance that your coach has been fire. Sign the petition to bring them back!
