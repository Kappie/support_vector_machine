'A man of peace is not a pacifist, a man of peace is simply a pool of silence. He pulsates a new kind of energy into the world, he sings a new song. He lives in a totally new way his very way of live is that of grace, that of prayer, that of compassion. Whomsoever he touches, he creates more love-energy. The man of peace is creative. He is not against war, because to be against anything is to be at war. He is not against war, he simply understands why war exists. And out of that understanding he becomes peaceful. Only when there are many people who are pools of peace, silence, understanding, will the war disappear.'OSHO, from: 'Zen: The Path of Paradox, vol II'  After reading that, I realized how ironic it is to say that I want to "fight for peace" (a quote from my activism post). So peace is not something to fight for but rather to live out for myself. As the anonymous person who commented after my activism post said, the best way to change the world for the better is to change myself for the better ("World Transformation thru Self Transformation"). I'm already on that path, but now I have the right attitude to go along with it.
