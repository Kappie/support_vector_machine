My dad, of course, needs to get his hair cut also. So I get to wait for him to come home since we can't bring Chris with us nor leave him here.   Since I have time, I might as well tell the story of why I call it Wal-Art. I was coming back from the movies with Dominique. Her parents were driving and needed to stop at Wal-Mart. Now, I am not a big fan of Wal-Mart so I had been searching for something to call it for a long time. We pull into the parking lot and there it is, as plain as night. The lighted sign above the entrance had one letter missing. Luckily for me it wasn't the "A", because then I would have to call it Wl-Mart...or Wal-Mrt. It was the "M" making a pronouncable name.   Well, I have been looking for things to use to make my Blogger better. I want to have menus on the two sides and the posts in the middle. Like  urlLink this  Blogger. If anybody could please E-Mail or IM me what I could do, I would be eternally grateful. For now, that's it. I will return to those who wait earnestly for some more amusing (well at least semi-amusing; or psuedo-amusing) anecdotes. While you wait, think about this: What color would a Smurf turn if you choked it? Next time you meet a Smurf, give it a try and get back to me on it.
