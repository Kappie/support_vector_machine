AH.... wonderful... and the rest of the people there were amusing too... but aside from being amusing i think i really enjoyed myself tonight for these four reasons.  1. cally and i were both happy again 2.no awkwardness finally 3.NO DRAMA !!!!! WAHOO!!! (it was a beautiful thing) 4. I really missed the older group... i have been hanging out with the younger group and i dont fit in with them so well... or know them as well.. except for maybe luke eddie and gucik... but my true colors come out when im with the older group... they are my true friends... and they always seem to brighten my day... no matter what shit is flying at the time... anyways though... it is 2 in the morning... just finally gave up reading the day after tomorrow... not gave up... but just finished for now... im having trouble putting it down... very very good....it started out a little slow... but it is picking up quite nicely... i smell a hitler conspiracy but the way the book is going i could be completely wrong... anyways im out for the night ....have fun ...sleep tight ...and for those of you at alana's be safe! -Nate :)
