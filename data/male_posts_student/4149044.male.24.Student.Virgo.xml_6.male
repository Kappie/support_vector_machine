Also have to study my ass off for the two finals I missed this past summer. I'm just glad I don't have any labs this year..that shi  t's such a fucking waste of time.       Early pharm application deadlines are coming up in a few months. Last year I applied to the #2 ranked school in the country and ended up on the waitlist. I'm happy I at least made it to the final cut, but it still pisses me off I have to spend another year in Dallas..another year stuck in limbo. I figure I'll apply to all schools in Texas and Oklahoma, and a few in California like #1 ranked UCSF. It would be cool to hang out with vpatel out in cali so we'll see. Not sure what other schools and states to look at..will have to check PharmCAS later. All I know is I'm not fucking around this time. No more "top 5 school or nothing" mentality. A PharmD's a PharmD right? As long as the school isn't some ghetto-ass dump in the boonies, I honestly could care less.       Damn I can't believe school's already starting up. The new townhouse is complete so it's also time to start hauling all my crap over there. The excitement never ends.
