I stated that I was very interested and active in the video editing arena. I requested to know what programs they use in their creations at our church, ie Gateway TV. I am kind of edgy about the whole thing, but in the end I really should get involved while Im younger. Experience is a very good thing to have, and thats what I am seeking. The only problem is that I am a little nervous that I would not display my "skillz" as well as I would want. Thats probably just me though, so Im not going to worry about it.  I think it is a good idea to try and get a volunteer position.  I guess some people would want to  urlLink apply to get paid  for doing this, but I just dont see the logic in that.
