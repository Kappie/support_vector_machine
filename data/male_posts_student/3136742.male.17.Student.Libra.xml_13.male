There are people sleeping on the seats in positions I could never dream possible.  - 20 minutes into the ride. We're in Philly. Still not used to the smell of ew. Next stop is Trenton, NJ!  - I'm sitting next to the conductor. He looks just like Lenny Clarke.  - Bulleting towards Trenton in my capsule of stink... Philly is a marvelously filthy city.  - Hello, trenton. Did I just see the guy who played Shooter McGavin in Happy Gilmore?  - I smell poop  - I'm writing the post that Kris is waiting for. It's devistating. I don't think I will post it.  - Some lady keeps walking by me and I want to rip that nasty fucking mole off of her chin.  - Next stop, Blobblegaargh, NJ. I have no clue what the intercom bitch just said.  - that building has"Detox the ghetto" written on it  then I stopped.  We arrived at Penn Station and tried to find Heish's grandfather. We called his cell a few times but couldn't seem to locate him. We tried calling him one last time and Matt was getting frustrated trying to find him. It shouldn't be that hard to find a little old jew on a cell phone. Turns out we were standing five feet away from him, in plain view. I thought Heish would know what his grandfather looked like, so I didn't bother asking if that little old man who looks like Bob Colombo from the yogurt commercials with a googly eye was his grandfather... I should have bothered.  So we took a train back to the grandparents' house. Old man drives a Lexus, grandma drives an Audi Quattro. Nice little house, not nearly as jewish as Heish's (actually you can't really tell these folks are Jewish). Very coherent, smart old couple. More up-to-date with news, trends, and technology than my parents (very cool grandparents). We get dropped off at this mall in Long Island which is much bigger than the King of Prussia mall, I'm told (I've never been there so I wouldn't know.) This place was fucking huge, and not a single thing to buy. I ended up sitting in a massage chair in a furniture store for a while. The back massage part was good but when I turned the calf massager on I really thought I was going to cum ini my pants (lovely image isn't it). I need $2000 for that chair. Before I left I bought dark, white, and milk chocolate bars from the Lindt store.... We came home, watched Mystic River, and then I tried to go to bed but realized by 1am that I wasn't tired. Good thing Cate and Kris were online to save me.... Yarrrghh  Day two. Wake up at 7. Leave by 8. Saw Jamie Bookers future on the train into NYC. She was a big fat schizophrenic bag lady. When she King-Konged her way onto the train people looked at her and new something was up. "Jesus, this is rediculous! I want a seat! Can anybody give me their seat! (this was more of a demand than a question)." Eager eyeballs rolled in her direction expecting some early morning entertainment, and the fat slug woman continued, "Could somebody please give me their seat, I've been schlepping all day! This is rediculous! I can't believe this!" And she wasn't just complaining, she was SHOUTING. "Is this upsetting everyone else? I can't believe they don't have a seat ready for me!" Then the conductor came by to take tickets. "Can't you give me a seat? This is horrible. I've been schlepping all day! I've been SCHLEPPING all day! I bet everyone is complaining about this! There's nowhere to sit!" -- "No, no one else is complaining. If it's any consolation to you, ma'm, you're not the only one standing"-- "But I've been schlepping ALL DAY!" (she actually sounded crazier. I love NY)... I asked Heish for a lesson in Yiddish a little later because my vocabulary was strictly limited to anything I've heard on Coffee Talk. What can I say-- I've got schpilkes in my ginnicktegezoik and I'm a schmear schtuppy. Oy, I'm getting veklempt just thinking about it.  I loved the trains, and the subway was great but a little disappointing; itwas too clean, new, and uncrowded. I wanted New York Grime and Filth.... New York  is  one grimey, filthy city though. Everywhere you go something smells like it's fermenting.  We met Heish's cousin. She's our age and is an over exaggeration of the stereotypical JAP, I'm-too-good-for-everything-even-though-I'm-dumb-as-my-nose-is-huge-and-spoiled-rotten, kind of cunt that you just want to strangle 'til her fucking head pops like a two-week-old zit on that spot on your back that you can't reach. So, of course, I had to (because it was just too good not to) let our reversed polarities conflict the whole damn day. She had us meet her in "The Euro Diner." Thanks a lot you fucking twat, just what I wanted was to travel to New York City with my jewish friend, myself being a complete culinary glutton, just to eat in a fucking Euro Diner-- Who the fuck would want a nice breakfast in a famous New York deli; I sure as hell wouldn't. I order Eggs Benedict and hot tea, Heish gets a Lox and Onion omlette, and the bitch gets a bagel with a *schmear* of cream cheese.She then tries to talk everyones ear off about trivial bullshit which no one wants to pretend to care about, like stealing her dad's credit card to buy dresses and going to a fancy bording school.  The food arrives, five minutes too late to be considered acceptable,at the hands of our fat, cross-eyed, scatterbrained, and oddly accented waitress, who has forgotten what Heish had ordered. But that was excusable, after all, there were two whole other fucking tables to wait on in the whole fucking restraunt. I could really see how that could be confusing, especially with such a complicated fucking menu. My Eggs Benidict was/were(?) horrible; burned, tasted like crap and the hashbrowns sucked too. Heish's omlette was below average (I've made better myself, and for a lot less than $9 and change). Fats-o forgot my tea, but I let that slide (she only attended our table to take our orders and deliver them. Horrible waitress). I was pretty pissed that I got such a shitty breakfast with such shitty service my first time in NYC, so as a tip I left out gargoyle of a waitress a bill with the face of a $10, but on the back it read something like "DIASPPOINTED? you wont be if you let Jesus Christ into your life... blah, blah"... Have a nice day Mrs. Danny-Devito-as-"The Penguin."...Waaaak, Waaaaaak Waaaaaak! (Despite all of this, I was actually having a very good time.)  Heish's brother's told us to visit the Sony Museum because it was "really cool." We did. Joe and I agreed that it was the stupidest thing either of us ever did. Not only was the technology almost 10 years out-of-date, but the whole exhibit was geared towards kids closer to the age of 5 than 20. (Heish's cousin left for work though, so the silence was enjoyable.)  After that we dilly-dallied for about 60 blocks until we finally got to Ben's Deli which Mathew briskly serpantineing us around the city to find. Our waiter was... wow... I think the guy must have been on coke, or amphetamines. That motherfucker was RACING. He was a middle-aged guy, tall, goofy hair, looked like the dead cop with the bullethole in his head in the freezer at the Fatelli's hide-out in the movie Goonies. Took our orders without writing anything down, ran back two minutes later apologizing for not having anything ready, came back with our iced teas, forgot Joe's Shirley Temple (yeah...), brought us our sandwiches and continued to bounce around like he had a jet powered pogostick up his ass. It was an incredible sight. I told Matt and Joe that he wasn't "all there in the head"and I bet he was the kind of guy that would try to bathe a baby in a blender (probably the most morbid thing I've ever thought, but since it popped into my head so quick I have no doubt that it's true.) The dude actually asked us to leave him a big tip because business was bad. I thought that took balls, so Joe paid $2 extra for his sandwich, and me and Matt both over-paid by about $12. That's pretty fucking generous (on Matt's and My part).  Just becase we thought it was necessary to haul our asses over 100 blocks in one afternoon we went to the giant Macy's. I tried on suits and found out that I'm a 38 short and look damn good (maybe even hot)in a charcoal gray suit (Heish looks good in pinstripes). So I'm buying some suits when I get home. The Asian suit salesman kept trying to sell us suits like he thought we were actually carrying $700 in our pockets. He was helpful though, and I had fun pretending I had money. Then I found an Alfani section. Italian clothes are great for me because they require no further alteration (as I'm built like an Italian. short limbs. wide chest. small waist.... dead sexy), so I got a really nice blue button down shirt on sale for $30. I am officially awesome now. I've decided to hold off on buying a computer so I can redo my wardrobe all Alfani.... While we were deciding on what to do next I almost walked into some security guard. I told him I thought he was a manikin and he continued to stare at me with that "Oooohh, no nigga'. You did NOT just speak to me?!" look.... then we saw Dana Carvey in a platinum-blonde, 1980s, new-wave style mullet, behind a counter selling watches.... fun  Ok, so we putzed around for a while, met up with Matt's cousin in a cafe and I explained to her why she was stupid, why her views on the world and her opinions were wrong, and why she should hate me. Then we saw STOMP! I really didn't want to see it because it was $60 and I'm cheap. It was FUCKING INCREDIBLE. I was really, really impressed. It was just an amazing show; the tallent, the dedication, the polyrhythms, the intensity. I would see it again in a heartbeat, and I'd recommend that everyone who ever gets the chance to see it not to pass it up... ok... it's late now. I walked non stop from 9-8 (or something thereabouts) and I'm probably typing really loud and not making sense because I'm tired, so... 'night.
