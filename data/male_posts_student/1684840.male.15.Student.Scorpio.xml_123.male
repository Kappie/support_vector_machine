But unfortunately/fortunately, Chris rang (to see if it was mufti... :S) and woke me up with enough time to get ready for school.  IT'S HALF TERM!!  WOOHOO!!  Geography was cool.  Stephen's salad lunch spilt out all over the floor while Kryptface Kylie stood there making nasty jokes and laughing at him.  RE was really fun.  Miss Oakley wasn't in and we had Mrs. Hodson.  We went to her room and watched the first bit of Priates of the Caribbean.  Science and ICT were average.  English was cool, we did drama.  Miss read out my Marmite poem lol.  Maths was fun too, we had to make a square with all of these cubes and make sure no 2 same coloured cubes were in one row or column.  Natalie won Â£2 off Mrs. lawley for doing it before everyone else did.  Regestration was dissapointing.  Might do something over the weekend, not sure.  I'll blog it of course...
