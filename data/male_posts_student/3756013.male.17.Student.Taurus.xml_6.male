Tuesday night I went to wings and More and came home to find out that they moved that damn blue thing that was out in front of my house! That made me they happiest person on this Planet! So needless to say Tuesday/Wednesday I got the best sleep ever.   Wednesday afternoon I woke up around 3:45, told you I slept good, and freaked out because I saw the time. I went to bed at 1am and slept that long, that has never happened to me before. Usually if I go to bed at 1 I wake up around 10am or so but this time I slept great! So after that I just watched a little TV and picked my mom up from the bus stop then Juan and I went looking for this CD that I've been wanting, Big  Rich, because I like their song "Save a Horse Ride a Cowboy". That was an adventure! We first go to Best Buy...I can't find the CD anywhere so I asked one of the sales people, well...They SAID they had 15 in stock but they were nowhere to be found. The lady looked in the back and everything, but I dunno if she really looked...She didn't look to bright. So after that we walked over to Barns and Noble to look in their CD section...Well the lady behind the counter seemed high on something and she told me they didn't have it after looking it up. Juan is telling me to forget it and order it online but I was determined to get that CD. So finally we drove to Target...and you would figure it would be the FIRST CD I see when I walk up. So I bought the CD and then went to Starbucks. It was a fun adventure lol and well worth it. I think Juan even thinks it was worth it too because he likes one of those songs on the CD because one of the Country people raps in it lol. Its a pretty cool song...and a really cool CD. :) Ok people, now I am going to bitch about politics so if you don't want to read on you don't have to...but for those people who always argue with me, I encourage you to read on.  Now, when we got into this war all the Demazazies bitched about it and wanted nothing to do with it. They wanted us to pull out and hand it back over to the Iraqis! Well...Now that president Bush does that...THEY BITCH ABOUT THAT!!! WHAT THE HOLY HELL!??! President Bush handed the country over the  Iraqi government early so it would eliminate the possibility of a Terrorist attack. That just makes them bitch! They are saying "We shouldn't of handed it over early because it didn't give a chance for people to celebrate" What the hell? He was doing them all a favor! Yall finally got what yall wanted, hell you even got it two days earlier than what President Bush said, now yall bitch about it. I wish they would Just sit down and shut the hell up! I saw a bumper Sticker that said it best... "The road to HELL is paved with Liberals" ...Thank You!
