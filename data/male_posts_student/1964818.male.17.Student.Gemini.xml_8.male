It was quite a quite ago when Luke first showed it to me at his house, and now in the past few days I decided to download some episodes and check it out.  And I am very glad that I did.  The show is just very interesting and some of the things they do are unbelievably cool, and others are absolutely hilarious.  Thanks to my blazing fast internet or I wouldn't be able to even watch this show, and thanks to Luke for showing me the light.  A couple more reality shows started last night that I am going to  have  to watch now.  And before now I already had two shows that I've been watching on that night.  The Amazing Race is a pretty interesting show and I watched it last year.  But at the end of the  race, after watching the whole thing from the start, something goes wrong and my DVR doesn't record the last show, so I never did find out who won...  Just a few day before I go on vacation...  I think it will be fun... I hope...  later...
