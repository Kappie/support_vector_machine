Watching Mickelson drain that putt on the 18th was one of the finer moments in sports for me.  It's why I watch things like this.  If you know the game of golf, this news has to make you happy.  I found myself grinning like a fool when the ball rolled in, and laughing quite a bit in the moments afterward as every last person at Augusta seemed to celebrate.  The best line was during a reply, showing only Mickelson hitting the putt and watching as it rolled toward the hole.  The commentator simply said - "Watch, as his life changes."  These are the moments for which we watch.
