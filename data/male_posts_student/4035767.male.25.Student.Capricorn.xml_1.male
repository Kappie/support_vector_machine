The music publisher that owns the song, The Richmond Organization, seems to think that  urlLink Guthrie's song , which of course has largely been forgotten by people who listen to music, will never recover from this blow.    "This puts a completely different spin on the song," said Kathryn Ostien, director of copyright licensing for the publisher. "The damage to the song is huge."  Well, maybe.  But I don't think it matters.  I think this falls pretty safely into the category of fair use.    But check out  urlLink Section 107 of the 1976 Copyright Act , and  urlLink this case , then decide for yourself.
