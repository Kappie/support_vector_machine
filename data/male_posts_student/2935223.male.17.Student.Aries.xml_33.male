Me and my partner are "married"...I wanted a divorce the first day.....so did she.....we're a good couple. :-P I have no klue what to talk about....besides the fact that I'm a gutless coward....I can't seem to muster up enough courage to be able to ask Keli out....even though I know she likes me...and I've plenty of opportunities to......wow I suck. Gonna go try and help my wife do our homework.... Peace!  Spense
