I think that's funny, my cat loves new people, she wouldn't get jealous.  But what struck me was the following statement from the article:   And pets can have a serious impact on a relationship. "Seventy percent of people asked to choose between their spouse and their dog will choose the dog," he adds.   Can you imagine?  How awful.  My cat has been destructive lately and she only seems to be getting worse.  I come home to plants on the floor with dirt everywhere.  I have a lovely houseplant that is shredded to bits.  It's 3 years old and she's killing it.  She's not even 3 months!  She has been chewing on my blinds and recently broke 3 of the blind flaps completely in half.  So my blinds look like crap now.  Yesterday I walked into my room when I heard struggling (I thought she was bothering the bird.)  No, she was tangled up in 3 strings for the blinds.  She's lucky she didn't fall off the shelf and hang herself!  Cats.  Sheesh.
