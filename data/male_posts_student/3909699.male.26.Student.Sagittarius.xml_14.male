After the initial shock of discovering that bottles of Coke(c) cost £1.30, i.e. A$3 – and these are 500ml not 600 as in Australia, I rediscovered the fact that shops produce their own knock-offs of Coke which are barely distinguishable - I got 500ml of Marks and Spencer Cola for only 60p, Also two Melton Mowbray (i.e. miniature) pork pies for 79p. Then at the counter I tried to pay with a pound coin, since I automatically thought of it as a two dollar coin, which is the same size. When I produced a second pound coin, shinier and larger than the first, the fifteen-year old acned shop boy realised that the first one was an Australian two dollar coin. I then corrected my mistake by giving him a 20p, a 10p and a 5p and a 5¢. He returned the 5¢ to me – I then gave him a 10¢ thinking it was a 10p, at which point he realised that the original 10p was in fact also a 10¢ - I took them all back and gave him a 20p. I don’t really understand any of this, since I’d thought I’d got rid of all my Aussie change. He was uncomprehendingly fascinated by my explanations of Australian numismatics.
