"Kemp" from their  Home from Home  (2002)  Last night Inhye gave me a ride to Giant (supermarket chain for you Californians), which was nice. It allowed me to get heavy stuff like milk and juice as well as lots of other groceries. Then we hung out at my place and chatted for a few hours. Hah she said I'm mature for a 23 year old for liking Duran Duran. It was cool.   After she left, I made a burrito with my fresh groceries. Mmm.. beans, rice and cheese...  Next random track is  Green Day   "Coming Clean" from their  Dookie  (1994)  I didn't do much else last night, I went to sleep kind of early.  I had weird dreams last night involving... Emeril, Piebald, an email from Melissa, and corned beef. It was bizarre.   Now  The Living End  is playing... "Staring at the Light" from their  Roll On  CD (2001)  I'm going to make myself breakfast now.  ***
