Seriously she is like 90 something years old and she hasnt died.  Actually she is somewhere in between 98 and 105 according to my calculator.  She really is just holding on.  LET GO AND DIE!!!  well anyways that wasnt even close to where i had intended to go with this blog...I just thought it would be romantic to be kidnapped...Like if I was in college and my g/f had my friends like jump me and take my to her...that would be suprising and romantic...now i dont think it would be romantic vice versa and i would never want to put my g/f through thinking she was being kidnapped. anyways...just my wierd little thought for the day...
