Playing Michael Learns to Rock - Take Me To Your Heart right now... have liked this song since i first saw the ad on TV... haha. The rain's still on now, feels kinda cool.. i feel its like me.... making others happy (since its cool) and leaving my inner soul to the elements of nature (sad) - in this case its the exposure to pple in my life... sheesh, the rain is always alone where it goes, and not very liked by some since it kinda spoils their day.. like outing to beach or smth...  Karie's off to her camp, and i gave her the morning call half an hr later! omg.. gd thing Sherman called her on time... Hope everything's well and goes fine.. and yea, hope that nothing gets cancelled or disrupted due to this rain... my raft making was cancelled due to this rain on the first day at around the same time too... 4 pm... lol. Enjoy ur camp Karie ! (well not as if she can see this... but well..)  Sherman's been a little fidgety after recess, doesnt respond much when i call him... ah heck.. i can sense it.. dun tell me NO hor ! hehe.. everyone's got their ups and downs.. he even dao me and walked off with harry after school... lol nvm.. >.  Tomorrow going off to Century Square again... with Sherman, to play WMMT... just wonder if Shini (Aaron) and H.Z (Yap) joining me or not... best if they did... haha.  Ah i guess that concludes this entry... i might come up with another one at night (see other pple's blogs only 1 per day, mine's like... 2-3... wonder if those seeing my blog will think i very free ? O.O" haha.. and yes, my entries are all lengthy and stuff, other peepz are shorter... jeez.... ~.~"
