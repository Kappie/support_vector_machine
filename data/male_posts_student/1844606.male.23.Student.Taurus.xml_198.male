I haven't had him in classes for over a year (thank god) but for a two year streach he was in at least 1 if not 2 of my classes a semester.  He's the type that loves the sound of his own voice and was hitting on women while we were waiting to walk in.  Also smoked 3 cigs before and after ceremonies.   We had a bagpipe open things.   I ran into at least four girls that I would have liked to have gone out with and about 75% of them didn't make eye contact...oh how grown up we have become.   I got cash, and then I got wasted. I believe I broke a few glasses inadvertantly by knocking them off a balcony.  I also managed to get food and then was unable to navigate getting cheese on fries and fries into mouth.  My head killed today.  I have to get a new muffler for the uberwonderhonda.   I want to get a replica cubs t-shirt that says BLACKSABBATH 22.
