It was like closure since she's going off to college next year. We parted just like we were, acquaintances. Though I think we could have been and I would have liked to have been friends, I feel better, and have a better memory of her. She was an interesting person. Anyway, I'm also a bit worried for Chelsea because she was a upset on the phone, and as usual didn't want to talk to me about it. Which she never is. It's like being locked right outside her and denied access, the unfortunate thing being that I'm not sure I'll gain it. As I am a more open person, I'll just need to accept that our two definitions of friendship aren't quite the same. But the sad part is it's her birthday. She shouldn't be sad. Dammit. I can't deny that it also evokes a bizarre amount of envy. I open myself up to whomever will listen, and she keeps many secrets hidden and won't reveal them under any circumstances. It makes me feel superficial sometimes. Another bad part of the day is when I gave Paige a ride over Sarah Fore, I had promised Paige a ride after school but then she asked for it sooner right after lunch when Sarah asked for one, and then I said maybe I could take both and Sarah said she'd just ride the bus. Paige did have a very good reason for going home when she realised that she needed to return home to get something, but Sarah is moving soon and I feel I've let her down. Lord knows she has enough problems. I'll miss her. I have four more exams, I feel really good about the sociology one I took today and the spanish one I took earlier, I got a 100 on the english exam for my great SOLs, I just need to finish stuff for english and sociology and do my oceanography review. Oh well. Until later.
