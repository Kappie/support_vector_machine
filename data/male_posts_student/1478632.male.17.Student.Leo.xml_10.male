I assure you that it was not supposed to offend anyone, except maybe Ben Perkins...but that is beside the point ;-). I'm writing to y'all from CAD class, and the reason is because...my PC at home has been, well...misplaced. I'm not sure why or how, but: One day it was there and the next day it wasn't. If you can assist me in finding it, please drop me an email. Wait. Scratch that. No computer = No Email. You may be asking "How are you updating your Blog, then?" Well, rest assured, I have my ways. Uhh. I'm gonna try to get a TaggitBoard up for you all to drop one-liners on, and maybe some NIALL quotes (NIALL is a Non-Intelligent Language Learner, the A means something, but I'm not sure what that is). Another Language bot is the Jibble Applet Bot, located  urlLink Here . I'm not sure where NIALL is right now, but the JibbleBot is cool because you can see how it actually maps its language.  Well. Later.  --Clash
