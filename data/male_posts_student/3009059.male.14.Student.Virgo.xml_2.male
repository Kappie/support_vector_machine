He was a boy She was a girl Can I make it anymore obvious? He spikes his hair She doesn't care What more can I say He wanted her  She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well  So all of her friends Said why not BUT SHE THINKS HE'S HAIRRRRRRYYYYYYYY  I'm not naming names ya know.  And the song goes on and on.  Yeah so, today, in English class, we had time to do some free work.  E3 dragged a pillow, and placed it on a desk, and so did Pyassm.  Together they cuddled, listening to My Band.  This also shows that they are not romantic.  The rest of the class gave them privacy, moving to the north side of the class.  We wish E3 and Pyassm a good life.
