Ahahaha yeah today was awesome. I don't think much else could have topped it. I'll just start right away since Jason, Gavin, and Josh are crashin' at my place tonight. 4 player PS2 *rented multitap* and just chillin' times, haha we were all talkin' about when we are 40, and we still talk to one another about this stuff hehe. Anyways, I'll get right onto today...  My day started off at 1030am this morning. I had to wake up early as today I had to get ready to go to my Tech Tutor test at Masonville Library. So I got up, ate a healthy breakfast of McD's, played some NBA street, and then headed out the door for the library.  Got to the library around 11:50amish, and then made my way to the front desk to get the test. I would then be sitting at Computer Internet Plus #1 for the next hour and forty minutes, working my way to complete the blasted quiz I had. It was mostly jokes, and I think I got the volunteer position, but there were a few things I didn't get....like something about making something show up on two different spreadsheets. But other than that everything else was jokes. At first I thought I couldn't copy and paste stuff from internet because they disabled right click on the mouse for EVERYTHING, but then remembered I can highlight stuff...whew. Excel and Word are two of the most useless pieces of junk though in the world in my opinion. Everyone should conform to OpenOffice.org =).  Well afterwards, I made my way to The Bay to find the blade oil for my buzzer. I couldn't find any there, and then just bused home. Well actually bused to UWO, then had to walk for 15 minutes, and then bused home again hehe. I called Jason and Becca to see where they were, and apparently they were wanderin' the downtown. I was thinkin' about meetin' them at Masonville, but then scrapped it afteI realized my blister from my sandals was getting to bleeding stage, well more of oozing stage *eeewww gross =P* and also I was just plain lazy. So walked home, eventually got my buzzer re-oiled at my uncle's house, and also checked out his Audigy 2 soundcard. It's pretty nice, but I can never really tell the difference with integrated and regular. Only difference I can really see is one can mix more noises and one can't. He also got Rainbow Six 3 and Tomb Raider AOD with it....I MEAN WTH!? ALL THAT FOR $150!? That's crazy....too bad my comp can't run the games or I'd be playin' two new games right now heh...actually probably not I don't find a passion in those Lara Croft games *the gaming heroine that has "a rack large enough for a Ming Vase" as described by GamePro magazine a while back* and Rainbow Six I've never liked.  Anyways when I got back home...I finally made the descision of cutting my hair....well shaving it I guess you can say now since hair isn't exactly present at the moment. Well sorta, it's like moss almost as described by my mom and dad. See ORIGINALLY it was gonna be around a #2 *if you know what I mean w/ buzzers* but then I accidentally cut off a bit too much off the side, and then I decided to ignore the fact it'll grow back in a few days, and decided to take it all off. So far Gerty says she'll yell at me later, lots of Eiee's from Wendy, Jenn and Lina and some whoa's from others. That's a shocked whoa not like a WHOA! After cutting my hair, I then sat around, SCed for a bit, ate food, and then got ready to head to the church to prepare the food for tomorrow. Well on the pro side, I never have to sleep with a wet head now, and also there is no drawn line between shampoo and soap now...IT'S ALL THE SAME! On the con side, for some reason my hair manages to get caught in the fibers in my shirt now, making it harder to put a shirt on. That actually surprised me I mean you'd think with shorter hair life would be easier with that sorta stuff...it backfired...sorta.  Getting to the church at 7pm, we *being Jason, Josh, and Me* begin to help my dad in preparing the food. Gavin then came a bit later, and that was when we began to fully work in full production. Right from the beginning the jokes were flying everywhere haha. Me and Josh fighting our veggie wars, the butchering of the chicken with the cleavers and the loud "WAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!" that followed every cut, or the imitation of celebrities/random figures with sish-kabobs...  Gavin: HEY LOOK IT'S TOAD FROM MARIO BROTHERS *makes a mushroom with lots of peppers and onions and some chicken* Joe: OMG GUYS I MADE ACHILLES FROM TROY! *puts shrimp resembling a helmet on top of a mushroom*  I would also go on to create one of those dragon dancers from a slab of chicken and a tomato, and also a Indian War Chief with more chicken and mushrooms and stuff. Yeah cooking can be so much fun. We couldn't marinate the chicken this year though, but oh well. Jason did the beef, and me Gavin and Josh packaged the stuff. Oh yeah we also talked about anime for some reason, and also my dream from yesterday....from different POV's.  Gavin kept talking about how we would be owned by the zombies, but I kept on claiming that we owned them since I didn't hear wimpy screams of humans, but the very low bass moans of zombies....as mentioned before Teenagers get these things in their heads from too much Silent Hill 3 and Resident Evil, but I'm not about to go through that shabang again about that stuff. Point is Josh's version had a Sniper Rifle-Flamethrower thing, where he'd miss the zombie even if it looked down the barrel, and Gavin's version of a regular Flamethrower. Jason had a Basketball-Ball Launching Gun of some sort...yeah that one still needs a bit of work...but it's still l33t....sorta.  Anyways yeah that was the most of my day...I'm gonna go play PS2 now, and eventually sleep tonight. Later....  Oh yes and before I leave, the current reviews of my haircut:  Wendy: EEEEEEEWWWWW! Jenn: Eeieieeeeee Gerty: I'll Laugh and Yell at you later Mabel YeeYee: Wah A Joe Deen gai lei jeen duk gum duun? John: LOL JOE YOUR EYEBROWS ARE LONGER THAN YOUR HAIR! Carmen: It looks good.*holy crap how the heck could he do that? Like omg...umm...I mean...like...oh geez...umm...like....eewww...geez..umm...like...eew...omg....LMSAO!omg omg omg omg omg omg omg ......EEEEWWWW!* It looks good =P Other random ones: Oh my Gosh, Wth?  Hey...I got one positive feedback...well probably not as I imitated...but meh.  Anywho I'm off now...Jason's staring over my shoulder reading this post while I'm typing, and I'm still gonna MSN for a bit and then I'll log off and do something more adrenaline-rushing than this...SLEEP! And PS2.  Later.
