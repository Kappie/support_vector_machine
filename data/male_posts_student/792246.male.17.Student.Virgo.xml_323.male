He said to me, "You can tell she's smart because she writes a lot."  Now, the context of that situation may be hazy, but what isn't is my recent realization that are geniuses among us. One might expect to find them deep in research institutes and making large amounts of money in jobs that benefit mankind, but I was lucky enough to discover one in the large cesspool that is Amazon.com. His name is stevethemoviefan.  While looking at some DVD on this site, I noticed a link off to the side leading to the "Listmania" of stevethemoviefan's entitled "The New Classic Series". Now, one of the awe-inspiring features of a "Listmania", is that the author is required to have some sort of title following their name, showcasing their expertise in that field. Naturally, the best of these are the genuine ones that really show you that this person is an expert and knows the world. stevethemoviefan's title was "High School Student". I clicked.  Steve's list opened a world I'd never dreamed of. He recommended movies to me I would never have considered seeing. There are many films that are true gems, that for whatever reason, don't get enough publicity and thus never become big enough for people like me to appreciate. Thank god for Steve for making me aware of such sleeper hits as "Kill Bill", "Pirates of the Caribbean", "Terminator", and "The Matrix." How does someone like him know how to find all these hidden gems? He must be a genius.  Of course, knowing which of these films to see first could pose a rather nasty situation, so good old stevethemoviefan is kind enough to provide a detailed summary of each film, and his thoughts on the movie. I'm going to give you a few of his comments, which are provided right beneath each entry.   The Matrix:    stevethemoviefan's comments: THE MATRIX    Terminator:   stevethemoviefan's comments: TERMINATOR   Yeah. Like I said. Pretty much a genius. I wandered from here into his about page, where I was treated to a shock. Most people maybe make about one listmania, realize it sucks, and never makes one again. Not stevethemoviefan. Steve is smart enough to realize that his lists are the most useful thing on Amazon as of yet, and has kindly given us, not two, not three, but 35 of them. HOLY FUCKING SHIT. 35 FUCKING LISTMANIAS! Only someone with no life, or someone who is an incredible genius would have 35 listmanias. I don't think I need to say which stevethemoviefan is.  Naturally, I can't even begin to cite the wonders of each and every listmania he has blessed us with, so instead I will end this post by telling you some of his best, in hopes that sometime you will go and read them in your ample free time.   Best of stevethemoviefan:   My DVD Collection (Part I) My DVD Collection (Part II) My DVD Collection (Part III) My DVD Collection (Part IV) My DVD Collection (Part V) My DVD Collection (Part VI My DVD Collection (Part VII)  So yes. Not only does my good pal stevethemoviefan know roman numerals, the sign of an intellectual, but he also has an insane number of DVDs. He must be rich off of his lists.   Movies I've Seen in Theaters (2003) Part 1 Movies I've Seen in Theaters (2003) Part 2  Personally, I found these lists an exciting glimpse into the mysterious and surely wonderful personal life stevethemoviefan.   My Favorite Movies of 2003 (No Order... Yet)  My Top 25 films of 2003  My Favorite Movies of 2004  My Sister and I Favorite Movies   My Favorite Movies  My Favorite Movies of All-Time   Why so many lists seemingly about the same thing? The great stevethemoviefan works in mysterious ways.   Movies of 2004 (Part 1)  Movies of 2004 (Part 2)  Movies of 2004 (Part 3)  Movies of 2004 (Part 4)   Can I just say how long I have been looking for a list of all the movies released in 2004? This is a dream.   The Brady Bunch Movie Collection  Robots will be in our future   Like I said. Mysterious ways.
