What the hell are you talking about, this history im so fond of?  Thomas is the history buff, Im just a hereditary reinactor!  I never thought id get this bull shit from you of all people. ::Also, this all comes back to what I said at the Socrates Cafe about how individuals are defined by society and to deny that society is to deny a part of yourself.

Viewed in this light, it's an incredibly high brow form of communication, moreso than you're piddly rants.::  Gossip isnt a form of self examination, its a form of examining others.  Besides, Im really only complaining about solve..problem..maria, And sound of music(a bloody list) the stuff in all that jazz would be funny in moderation, I thought the rating with decimals and everything was funny.  your making this a bigger deal than it is.
