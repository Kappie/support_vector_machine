Although I haven't done anything productive over vacation, I enjoy being bored at home rather than in school. Today I went browsing music stores in search of a bass. And since there's only two music stores around where I live, it was a pretty short journey. C Music seemed to have the bass that appealed to me. It was a sleek Ibanez SR3000E. But most of you people don't know what that means, so why do I include details like that? Anyway for a bass that was originally 1,300$, the guy is selling it for 390$ with a hard shell gig case. Pretty good deal even though it's used. That was pretty much all I saw. At Morottos all they had was expensive Washburns that were ugly and cheap Peaveys. Enough of my rambling about what I want. And I really like this song. The Blank Theory - Invisible. Thanks to Eidleman for sending me it. I was flipping through the channels the other day and I think I found a new sport to pick up. Trick shot billiards. It's amazing. The one guy did this shot where he jumped the ball over a cue shaft, hit the one ball in, had the cue ball come back and hit another one. Too bad I can't even play regular pool. There goes another sport doomed for me. One piece of advice before I leave: Trust as little people as possible. If there's one thing I hate it's people who you think you can trust say crap behind your back. Only trust those people who you know won't take the trust you give them and shove it down your throat. Amen.  Listen to H.I.M.
