I now have two new books, Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' and Dickens' 'Tale Of Two Cities'. I've finished 'Are You Dave Gorman?' and it was amazing, he also made an appearance on They Think Its All Over on friday too, but I missed it and only saw some parts of its repeat saturday night. Damn.  At the moment I just feel like crap, can't put it in any other way, just crap. I honestly have no idea whats going on, I just feel really angry at myself at most times and thinking about a lot of things, which just makes me feel even worse. I can't stop it either, and its really getting to me.  I've got problems nearly everywhere right now, home, outside, school, internet, I can't really enjoy myself without thinking of things.  I'm going to get an appointment with Connexions who are very conveniently still at my school, until then I can just hope that things can't get any worse. People may think I'm throwing a hissy-fit, but even though I would post anything here, I'm not going to go into detail about whats going on right now. All I can is that it hurts like hell.
