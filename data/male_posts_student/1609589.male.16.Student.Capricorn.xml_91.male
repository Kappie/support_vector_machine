It's fucking COSMETICS!! They try and convince me that having an impacted toof will hurt later in life, where in all logic it should hurt like SHIT now. How the fuck is it supposed to hurt when i'm 30, when i stop growing at 17? How is overbite... bad?  People don't seem to notice this about me, but I really don't give a flying FUCK what i look like to other people. People don't think i'm up to "standard?" I say, go fuck yourself, i have better shit to be doing than spending 3 hours on a treadmill, fuck- that thing feels like you're running nowhere, i call it the fucking guilt-trip machine.  Flossing is fucking overrated. I barely ever floss, and if i do, it's usually because i'm going to the dentist. I went to the dentist yesterday, not one cavity. I brush my teef, but i don't get in there and brush for 5 minutes like they tell ya to. And i still got no cavities. I have a waterpick for flossing, but i don't wanna use it because it gets water fucking everywhere, and it takes an hour to set up.  "What are ya doin, snider? ya get firsty?"  "No, I'm flossin! Damn, my teef hurt!"  On a semi-different topic...  I recently told someone that if my orthodontist gets any more bright fucking ideas about messing with my teeth for another year, i was gonna hit her. Then I thought, "oh, maybe i shouldnt say that, cuz shes a woman." Then i thought "well, i'd do the same for a man." So, I guess I'm in favor of equality.  Well, the family wants me to watch Mr. Deeds wif em, i guess i'll go.
