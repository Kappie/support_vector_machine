An example of this is Ross. The other day, we were chatting and suddenly he says "Why the f**k am i top of the immaturity table?" And i said to him because Sam actually behaved therefore he moves up, and as Ross was second, he then became first. Apparently though, Sam did throw a menu, but i didnt see it, and its me writing this thing, not Ross.  I'd just like to point out to people that there is a comment feature underneath each blog, so feel free to use it.....Ross! I think these things come in useful at times like this, so its not just between me and whoever has a problem with what i write.  Also, i dont do these things to be hated. Why would i write things like this about my mates? I'm not actually being that serious, and i dont want to come across all poncy to others. The immaturity table is just a joke, just a way to show who i think is the most immature.  So from now on, i'd appreciate it if people left feedback, their views, underneath each blog, so myself and others can see....even if its just a quick hello!  Well, thats all i have to say, had to write it down!   Thanks for reading,
