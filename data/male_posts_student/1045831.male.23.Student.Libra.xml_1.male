I have been watching Queer eye and one of the cats on there always is talking about moisturizing your face and what not so one night when I ran out of bar soap and contact solution I came upstairs at about 4am to look for some when I discovered a treasure trove of all kinds of shit in my sisters bathroom closet and cleaned her out.  I know have Facial Scrub to exfoliate, Facial Wash, Face Lotion, and shampoo and conditioner.  Yes this is about 10 times the amount of stuff I had before..  Not to mention the regular stuff I stocked up on too like Q-Tips.  So getting the skin taken care of and yes I've lost more weight, I'm now down to a slim 225.  Tomorrow I start working out.  I'm telling you, prepare yourself for the new improved Zeke.  I don't know if you folks will be able to handle it.
