Sorry to my group in English Class, I wouldn't have been any help anyway.  Besides, wasn't fun going home anyway, because I cleaned.  I cleaned while I was sick.  Fun times, eh?  Well, it's my dad's birthday today, and he wanted a clean house.  So, I came home, drugged myself up with asprin and cleaned.  And cleaned.  And fucking cleaned.  For about four hours.  Then my dad came home, and pointed out everything I  didn't  do, and there wasn't a lot I hadn't done.  Uhg, just pisses me off, he's never satisfied with anything.  Acted like I didn't even attempt to clean.  -  Met the new band directors yesterday.  They're nice people, the only reason everyone is pissed off at them is because they're replacing Siess and PC.  It's not their fault.  Besides, they're trying really hard to convince a few people (You know who you are, clarinet buddies) to stay in band, which is good.  -  Due to Band/Choir trips and Senior Skip Day, there were only around eleven people in my math class.  So we basically did absolutely nothing.  Oh, we (Jason, Elona, Jenni, and Jessica) made a mural using markers on the white board.  It was great.  Jason got a picture, though his camera had no flash.  So no idea how that turned out.  -  Well, I'm gonna go sleep.
