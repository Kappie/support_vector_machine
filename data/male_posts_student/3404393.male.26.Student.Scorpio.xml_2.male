If you make a mistake doing something, isn't is safe to say that you will know the next time not to make that same mistake, and thus have learned something from the experience?  If this is the case, why are we raised in an educational system that punishes you for making mistakes? If that's one of the best ways to learn and grow, you'd think our teachers and elders would take advantage of this to facilitate our development as individuals...  Just a suggestion to all those teachers out there - Give two tests to your students, and use the second one as the grade. This will be a much better representation of what your students are learning.  No one has gone through life making no mistakes, so don't contribute to the problem by pushing this thought process that 'mistakes are bad' onto others.  Just my two cents worth-  Jonathan
