Because i'm either too busy with school, or getting drunk, or both at the same time. There's another reason why i stopped watching television, propaganda- the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person.  i think, therefore i don't trust the media ... i just watched the documentary "Bowling for Columbine." it was enlightening...   Marilyn Manson: "The two by-products of that whole tragedy were, violence in entertainment, and gun control. And how perfect that that was the two things that we were going to talk about with the upcoming election. And also, then we forgot about Monica Lewinsky and we forgot about, uh, the President was shooting bombs overseas, yet I'm a bad guy because I, well I sing some rock-and-roll songs, and who's a bigger influence, the President or Marilyn Manson? I'd like to think me, but I'm going to go with the President. "  Michael Moore: "Do you know that on the day of the Columbine massacre, the US dropped more bombs on Kosovo than any other day? "  Marilyn Manson: "I do know that, and I think that's really ironic, that nobody said 'well maybe the President had an influence on this violent behavior' Because that's not the way the media wants to take it and spin it, and turn it into fear, because then you're watching television, you're watching the news, you're being pumped full of fear, there's floods, there's AIDS, there's murder, cut to commercial, buy the Acura, buy the Colgate, if you have bad breath they're not going to talk to you, if you have pimples, the girl's not going to fuck you, and it's just this campaign of fear, and consumption, and that's what I think it's all based on, the whole idea of 'keep everyone afraid, and they'll consume.'  "   I've recently started to really think about the world we live in. When you're in college and you really don't know what you want to do with your life you start to question everything you do. It's really frustrating. In another 3 years i'll have a degree and be out in the real world. god i'm 19 years old and i don't know what i want to be. actually a lot of people my age don't know what they want to do yet so blah. The whole time i was in elementary, middle, and high school, i always knew that i would have to make a lot of huge decisions in the future. now here i am.  make the choice bob . you're in college. pick a major. i'm majoring in math. become a math teacher? i know i can do better than that. i'm thinking about the FBI. i'm really thinking about the FBI. maybe i could be an undercover calculus teacher like Arnold in Kindergarten Cop.  "Who is your daddy.. and what does he do?"  ok he was a kindergarten teacher, but still.. I really gotta look into this.. "After you’ve been accepted by the agency, you’ll train at the FBI academy on the US Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia for 16 weeks." hopefully none of the tests require swimming because i will drown...  Only three classes to go and the weekend begins.. it's going to be incredible.. have a smutty weekend because  SMUT  will.. 7 more days  :-P  - R w L super SMUT
