This specific Cravens was just telling me a rather surreal dream they had, and they are also a fan of Nightmare on Elm Street. Hmm.  I'm not really cutting. I got here late, hanged out with said Cravens a few minutes and then couldn't find my class. Good times(eat that Jonathan). So like, I came up with a superhero. "Big Nose Santa". He flies around on a sleigh and saves Jews from Christian and Muslim oppresion, and then gives them dreidels afterwards. Action figures TBA.  In geeky news, the Playstation remakes of Final Fantasy 12 have been confirmed for a US release. *orgasms, as said Cravens will testify* This means that every single one except for 3 is now playable on Playstation 2. Yatta!  Claudia has comments now. Good times.  EDIT: Above "Good times." should be followed by the words "Suck that Jonathan. That's right. They're NOT your words. Go suck some penis." Thank you for your time and we apologize for the printing(?) error.   The first of MANY posts from the library. It's almost like a landmark. Anyways, if I'm not mistaken, this post was interrupted by my math teacher walking into the library and spotting me, while I was "cutting" that very class. I believe they were in the computer lab. Blah.
