End it with yet another question about what's really going on.   I'm just thinking out loud.  Because I only got dos examens mas! Tommorow is Spanish, oh Hosannah in the Highest!   Zend-Avetas Scary stuff.  Judaism and Christianity stole half their crap from these dudes.  Crazy.  Random Political thought- How is Democracy not Tyranny of the majority in it's ideal form? How is a Republic not just a ruling elite? Why is government so damn complicated?
