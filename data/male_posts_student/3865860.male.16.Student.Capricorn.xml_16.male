This is goin to be an outlet for my feelings and my life generally so sit back and watch. I just noticed when i previewed this post the time is screwed up it should be GMT damnit, oh well i guess it will just have to be like that. Going to see Ben Kweller tomorrow night at the academy its going to be great. You should check out BKs website http://www.benkweller.com hes amazing. I will tell about you the gig tomorrow. Yay i'm not feeling in any way depressed at this moment in time thats a massive bonus! Anyways i better be goin.
