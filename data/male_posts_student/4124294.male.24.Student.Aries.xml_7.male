Five days have zoomed by since my last entry, and if you were to ask me what I've been up to, all I can do is scratch my head and go, "I dunno." Actually, I've been rather sniffly lately, it's been freezing over here, and wet, so the flu has descended upon poor ol' me. That, and trying to juggle work for uni -- it's getting really hectic. So yeah. That's basically been the past few days. *sigh*  Have been meaning to work on this site a bit more, maybe put up a message board and sidebar lists and stuff like that. As soon as I work out how to do it, it'll happen, I promise. Dunno when, dunno how, but it  will  happen. Heh.  Finally, let me leave you with a few candid photos from the last production that I was involved in here at Murdoch Uni, a musical aimed at children entitled  Athena Emu at the Olympics.  I wrote the music and lyrics and had to work with a very talented group of musicians to get the songs together, and all in all, I dare say we did well (in all modesty, hehehe) -- even in the face of such dubious titles as  Hermes Where the Heart Is, Everybody Loves A Boy Band,  and, everybody's all-time favourite,  The Pussy Song.  Meow!      The baddies in the play, fully-costumed.         Some of the cast rehearsing for an acrobatic dance scene.          Promotional photo of the character of Zeus, played by my pal Stan Schirmer.        Me, Peta and Andrew, three members of the band.        A photo of my good friend Paul, all dolled up in the character of Zorba the Fox.        The cockatoos: from left, Michelle, Teej, someone and Jess. I forget the third girl's name. Whoops. *blushes*
