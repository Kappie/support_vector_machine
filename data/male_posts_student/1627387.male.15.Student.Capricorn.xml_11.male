Look, if you seriously screw up when trying to make her realize how you feel, and how much you care, I'm quite certian (as in, have no clue and am just hoping I'm right) that you should give the person you feel affectionately towards some time away from you. If things don't work out, but be friends, especially if thats what she wanted in the first place and you were to much of a selfish dumbass to realize that her talking to you at all is a miracle. She can stay mad as long as she wants, but I sure hope it's not forever. Just hope that she talks to you again, and hope that ths time you don't screw things up. You may want to tell her how you feel, to tell her that she's the one you want to share your first dance, kiss, drive-in movie with, but you'll probably just freak her out more.  Just give her some time.    And you should also hope and pray she doesn't read your blog.      G'night readers, I need some sleep.
