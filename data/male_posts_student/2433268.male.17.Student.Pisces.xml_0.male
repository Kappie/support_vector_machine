What do you do during one of those kind of days?  I'll tell you what you do, you sit around and blog like there's no tomorrow.  Because really what else can you do? Sure you could go outside, find a basketball and shoot some hoops, but what's the point really??  I find that in this situation it's good to have a healthy list of instant messengers available...my favorites being  urlLink ICQ  as well as  urlLink AOL Instant Messenger  and last but not least  urlLink Yahoo Instant Messenger .  Currently I'd recommend Yahoo because they have this AWESOME new interface that really puts it over AOL who has sort of dominated it for years.  ICQ is good if you just wanna connect with people and talk.  MSN deserves a horrible fate as yet another Windows attempt at including something to keep the competitors away  . Sorry I just couldn't resist that one.  Well enough on that, I've filled up enough bla time for now and will probably be back later today to fill up more.
