Whats true for me isn't necessarily true for you, and vice versa. That being said, I also think that there are some universal truths out there. Example you ask? Don't meddle in other people's shit. In fact, don't do something that could inadvertantly impact someone else's life in a negative way, even if you technically "weren't at fault". If its not your business, dont bring it up, dont talk about it, dont joke about it, and sure as hell don't do something thats gonna impact a situation.
