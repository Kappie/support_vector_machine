At Centenary, this would have caused quite a stir; I probably would have received a phone call from Gene Gregory or Scott Greenwood, and accolades from my fellow students.  Hell, it might have gotten me laid (what private college girls found attractive always bewildered and pleased me).  Here, I believe it was read in all seriousness, judging by the number of people who emailed me and said, "You're not going to get a steak dinner."    Hey, I'll take Steak  Eggs at Waffle House.  I'm a whore for the free meal.    Terrorist Alert Orange (which is higher than Yellow, as ROY-G-BIV taught me), and Donald Rumsfield says this has nothing to do with war in Iraq.  Damn right!  Yelling, "Bomb the Iraqi fuckers!" at televised press conferences makes the Iraqi viewing public laugh..."He's funny, like Jerry Lewis!  And not retaining pounds of water!"  I don't believe that anti-war sentiment or North Dakota exist.  I never hear either mentioned on the news.
