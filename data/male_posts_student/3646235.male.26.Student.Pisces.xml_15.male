I'm adding Drano to my fiancee's tub, she'll be surprised!  Man, she looses a lot of hair in the tub!  Wookie!  She left me a "Honey To Do" list (drano wasn't on it).  I don't mind doing things for her, as long as she makes it like I took it upon myself to do something for her, not a list of things I HAVE to do for her.  Started an organotypic culture today.  Instead of growing cells in 2D, we're growing them in a 3D matrix that will look more like in vivo tissue.  Pretty cool.  The cells are in a collagen matrix, so it looks like jello.  Man, I'm going to write more on "deep" topics, but I don't feel like it.  My jaw hurts.  Word of the Day: unfettered - free; unrestrained
