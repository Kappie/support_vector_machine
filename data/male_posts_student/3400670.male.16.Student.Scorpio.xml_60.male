The Day After... no, not that new one in the theaters (the day after tomorrow)... the one made in the 80s about nuclear war... some of you probably dont know what i'm talking about... but some (hopefully Ms. Clark) will know... I thought it was a good movie.. and brought up one of my favorite quotes from Einstein: "I don't know how world war 3 will be fought, but i can tell you how world war 4 will be fought; with sticks and stones..." very grim indeed, but a very good movie...
