Last night I finally got my Handbook sent out...this morning to my complet surprise, the 5 people that I send it to...4 of them bounced back...-_-... and for the rest of the day, these guys have been on my ass asking for the draft when their the one who couldn't find the space the recieve it...when times like this, I wished that everyone used Gmail...:D  Naruto Spot will be once again up tomorow, I had the honor of again looking over the site and find bugs and so on...it was a good night of work and we got everything fixed up and looking like new. All I need to do it to upload the current Naruto Shows and we should be ready to go tomorow. Hope the server doesn't break on my again. I can't take another server break-down...  Seems that my parents will be leaving for a quick tour of Canada this weekend, they'll be going to a couple of places...but since I am all booked Friday and Sunday, I can't go with them >  Later Days...
