I tell you what, I am not working on Sunday's anymore! I will make up that time lost during the week a few hours a day so its less stress on me. I need time off and this will give me the breather I need every week.   My mind wanders a lot lately, if anyone wanted to know. I dream, plan, think, and then start the process all over again. I am trying to picture my self 5 years from now and what I will be doing. I really don't know except that it will involve computers/internet and writing. I want to build that web idea of mine, I need support though. I think I will talk with my uncle and run my ideas by him. He is really smart and I could take constructive criticism from him. He wouldn't b.s. me either, if it sucks it sucks. You know what I mean? I would love to do some sort of web job permanently and if it paid well enough, that would be my main source of cash'ola.  I have been doing pretty good at becoming more of a robot. I really have. It was hard at first, but now it is easier and easier. Remove feelings and emotions from the day to day life and its much better. Of course I still laugh and care about my friends etc...etc.... but the invisible forces do not tell me when to move anymore.   I need to finish some homework but I want to take a shower.
