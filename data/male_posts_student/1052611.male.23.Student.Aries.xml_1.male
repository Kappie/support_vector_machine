The book was launched in Bangalore over the weekend. Do check out  urlLink a review .   Disclaimer: I don't have any vested interest in the book and I haven't read it myself. However, I have heard rave reviews from friends, so thought of recommending it to you guys, before I go and pick up a copy for myself.
