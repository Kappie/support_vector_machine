Suppose I should go practice clarinet or do the biology homework but it doesn't seem so tempting :/ Decided to walk home from Chinese School since I probably need to get fitter *read I probably need to get off my fat ass and do something*  Ended up killing myself, and my calves still hurt >_ On second thoughts that homework doesn't seem so bad...
