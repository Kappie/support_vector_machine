The solution: stop thinking up of fucking ideas on how to stick to government policy and just follow the other schools that use 6 periods.  Here's the schedule:  Monday/Tuesday: P1-P6  Wednesday: P1, P3, P5  Thursday: P2, P4, P6  Friday: Start at 0815 and not 0750 P1-P6  It's a crock of shit. Why not just let me put napalm in the office and light a match?
