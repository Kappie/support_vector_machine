As I stare into the starry void in the quite confines of the night I realize that in this prodigious expanse of dead gas and dust there is a diamond in the ruff.  Earth.  Known through the ages as aarde, verden, maa, mondiale, Erde, dunia, tsuchi, çåìë, kiwanja, and mull.  No matter what language it is in Earth still names one thing.  The beautiful rock in the void where life was made, where life found a way, where all the emptiness is compensated for.  For even if the infinite expanses of the universe are void a single person, a single cell, a single cup of coffee, a single smile, makes it all worth while.  And when I think of this I realize that the univerese is'nt empty because life is a mistake.  It is empty so that we can appreciate that what we have is rare, that it is beautiful, and that it should be charished more than anything.  And this gives me a hint to why we are here.  We are here, plain and simply, to be.  Though this blink of time that we are on this earth is short by the prodigious standerds of the universe.  Each moment is beautiful for it only happens once.  And because life is short we charish it so.  So when I contemplate with myself why I am here I just smile and say to myself, life exists for this moment and for every moment before it and after.  And I know that no true answer to life will ever be given in this existence.  And I am happy becuase i know to have knowledge and to mourn is worse than to be naive and be blissfull.  So charish each moment like it is your last and remember that each will only happen once.
