He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real..."   John Kerry, July 29, 2004: "Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so."   Don' t you justlove it when you nail yourself?
