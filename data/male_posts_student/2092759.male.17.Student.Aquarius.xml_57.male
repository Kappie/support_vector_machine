Invader Zim, Simpsons, Family Guy, Sealab 2021, Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law, and to cap it all off at the end of the day My Big Fat Greek Wedding. My sister came down from Bakersfield yesterday to pick up my nephew, spent the night, and then went home today.             A Summary of my conversation with my sister"             "Hi Liz, how are yo.. O, ok, ill cya later..." O well, thats the consequences of being a 21 year old trying to support her family between a low-income job and a welfare check.     I cant wait for my trip to Washington. I really, really want to get the hell out of my house for something more then work and school. Just three weeks left, and then I get to go and see if im half as enlightened and informed as my ego thinks I am. And following that adventure in the realm of the political I get to come back to Anaheim and go to band camp, rejoining the human race.     Thats all the personal information for the day, and now the public servce announcement:    To anyone who frequents my site and is going to be over the age of 18 by November, please leave your Email adress as a comment. For those of you who dont plan on voting: "The only person you can blame for the state of our country as a non-voter is yourself, so, get off your lazy ass and go to vote for somebody. I dont care if you vote for  the brain of a three year old dead monkey frozen in Carbonite (AKA, Bush) or  the termite eaten entrails of a petrified tree (AKA, Kerry). Personally, im for the tree, but thats another story. Just vote, you lazy sonofabitch."
