I've also started to randomly write down poems, and song lyrics for no apparent reason.  I guess it's good to have my slightly artistic side back, but I wonder why?  I'm not particuarly sad or happy.  I have moments of either emotion randomly but that's about it.  Speaking of which, I'm thinking if I become a  Quaker, that I'll also be Baha'i.  That seems like a very promising religion, but I can't get over the fact that the think Baha'u'llah as divine.  Oh well.... I need to read more about it anyway.  The most interesting thing I found was probubly this:  "The Bahá'í belief in one God means that the universe and all creatures and forces within it have been created by a single supernatural Being. This Being, Whom we call God, has absolute control over His creation (omnipotence) as well as perfect and complete knowledge of it (omniscience). Although we may have different concepts of God's nature, although we may pray to Him in different languages and call Him by different names--Allah or Yahweh, God or Brahma--nevertheless, we are speaking about the same unique Being.

Isn't that just wonderful?  All of us over the world, praying, and worshipping the same infinitely giant God?  Doesn't it just re-usure people to know, that God is all and that only in our ignorance we'd try to make him into many, even though He is all things?  Wow, I really just felt a new zeal and conviction I haven't felt in awhile.  I feel pretty happy about that.
