Nothing has changed except it's gotten later, and what's bothering me still wants to stay.  The best part, is their is no answer I can really get from anyone else that'll make me happy.  It's one of those situations where everything is entirely in my control like I always want it, and now that I have that, I hate it.  Damn.    I posted on an Occult forum for fun.  I seriously need to learn how to do that Out of Body stuff, that'd probubly make me crazy enough to be happy.  Even though it's all probubly just a bunch of BS.   I get involved in to much crazy stuff.  Kwa Nini Mungu?
