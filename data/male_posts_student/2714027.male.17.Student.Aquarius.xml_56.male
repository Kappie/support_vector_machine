This also happens to be a day when I'm going to a university for an open day, and will have been to another three unis earlier that week. What utter bastards!!!   And then the control panel for the website server isn't working, so I can't update anything on any of my websites. There's also a Geography revision session at school today, but I'll have to cycle in because the bus fare is overpriced and my mum has taken my car for the day.   Grrr...
