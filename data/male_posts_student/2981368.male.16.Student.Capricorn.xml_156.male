First of all his name was Seth or Setesh, set is just for lazy people   Traditionally yes Seth is the God of evil / mischief and the like He is linked to Loki the Norse god of mischief - but really he was just a sneaky little trouble maker, he cut Osirus into little pieces and scattered them along the Nile. I believe he was also responsible for the theft of Horus's eye. In short he was a bit of a jerk  Anubis has more to do with death and feeding hearts to big scary monsters and also looked wayyyyy cooler than Seth   You may have noticed that I am somewhat of a Stargate fan! In Stargate Anubis is the most powerful system lord ever known, commands a vast army and is feared by all. He is the prominant bad guy for 2 seasons, I believe only Apophis held that position for longer and he cheated by dying 3 times. Seth on the other hand, features for one measly episode, as the Goa'uld leader of a poxy little cult on Earth, he is swiftly killed   Anubis has a big ass cloak and no face and is partially ascended (VERY COOL) Seth looks like George Michael on crack  thus overall, Anubis is better than Seth , so there *rasberry*  + I forgot what else you said but i doubt it made sense   ~ Anubis - KICKS ALL YO HONKY ASSES AT EVIL !
