He was an awesome guy and whenever somebody says something about him I feel really proud to know that I was his friend and that he chose me that day in second grade to come and hang out with them, but how do i repay him? By ignoring and cutting off contact with him. Some friend I am. Well I'm gonna make a new post about something else so I don't have to think about this right now. catch you cats on the flip flop later
