Incredible rumors spread about the stone's magical properties, which include healing, travel through space and time, and telepathy.  If you haven't yet guessed, you're in  urlLink Charles Williams  territory again. This time the subject is his second novel,  urlLink Many Dimensions , first published in 1931. This book differs greatly from my introduction to Williams, the complex and dense Descent Into Hell, as it is a much more straightforward, almost breezy, read. The book is filled with witty, well-defined characters and a storyline that begs a reader to keep turning the pages.  It is revealed that the stone is composed of "first matter" -- the original matter that God called into existence at the creation. The stone was entrusted to King Solomon, who referred to the stone as "The End of Desire." But mankind, in its fallen state, has its heart set on many desires. Some people want to use the stone for good (such as healing people or improving intelligence), but the object has been consecrated for Holy purposes, which goes even beyond our notions of "good." Debates over the correct use of the stone causes unexpected conflict between common people. Even worse is the desire of the government and big business to exert power and control over an object that they simply do not understand. Using the stone for evil ends leads to calamitous results. Everyone desires the stone, but few desire the One who gives the stone its power.  Charles Williams books can be hard to find, which is a shame because I simply could not put this book down. Here's hoping that someday soon he'll get the recognition he deserves and find a place on bookstore shelves with C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.
