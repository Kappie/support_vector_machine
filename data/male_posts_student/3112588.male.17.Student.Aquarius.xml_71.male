LoL! i do have other things to do sometimes, you know--like shopping, movies, friends--all that good JAZZ! sooo i was on the phone until like 2:30am this morning just talking to one of my friends, and it was a good long talk. i finally said what i needed to say, and everything turned out A-OK! LoL! how cheesy huh? well, i just got back from the video store, and i got: Starsky and Hutch! i hope it'll turn out to be good, b/c i really dont feel like watching another terrible movie...but we know that i just love ben stiller, so i won't be able to turn it off, no matter how stupid or idiotic it is! haha....i was supposed to have coffee with vanessa today, but some stuff came up and we weren't able to meet eachother there. so i came home and kinda like "rested my eyes" and i guess i dozed off for like 10 minutes. oh well! i love taking naps, and im sure all of you know that LoL! if i could sleep my life away, i probably would---nah, too many good times to miss...member when all of us went to the beach over spring break? it was me, jeremy, sara, daniella, laura, jeremy w, karl, and dan? and it was like pouring on the way to santa cruz, and we like thought we were going to die? and then we went to tommy z's house and had burritos and laura kept spitting up her food everywhere and we locked them outside of the house when it started to pour again? and then we finally came back to my house and watch "Duplex"---"Its looser than a dublin whore!"--we all turned and said: LAURA!!!! LoL!! see? i guess i wouldnt sleep my life away, but its all good. tomorrow i dunno what im going to do. i told tim that i would go with him to find Las Positas so that he can register for his classes before he moves....and then my g-ma said that she would be dropping by early in the morning to drop something off for me. then thursday, im free but i wanna go shopping with my CV groupies! laura and sarah--dude, you guys! you know we have to go....and then friday, going to see "The Bourne Supremacy" with my family and the Rayhbucks...tim, you gonna come? lemme know--im ordering tix tomorrow. and then saturday, hopefully my parents will let me stay home when they go up to our cabin for the night. i really kinda wanna just paint on saturday, b/c some of the walls in our house are in DIRE NEED to be touched up--no lie. suzy said that she would help me...then sunday--back to SBC i guess, wherei can hear Mr.Arnott bash on Dr.Phil--GASP!! i love Dr.Phil, im sorry, but i do! he's a good guy, and gives ppl some really good advice...but thats just me. before i go, here's some food for thought: you know how almost every movie now makes fun of plastic surgery and botox and cologen and crap? well--funny how the ppl like us paying to see that funny stuff and the ones like us that LOVE watching plastic surgery shows are the ones that are going to grow up and get plastic surgery and botox...hmm, so lets not waste our money to watch it--we have to save up to actually get it guys! thats my little idiotic-meaningless idea for today. well, toodles guys.
