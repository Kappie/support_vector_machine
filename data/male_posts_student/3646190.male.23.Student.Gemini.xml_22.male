Sure I have felt emotionally close to them, but the other two components are missing. At least in my attempt to find some place of belonging, I have turned to the Internet for now. It is a sad reflection of the world where people who desire inner peace and social and economic justice have nowhere to go--not their local communities and not even progressive circles to find solace.  I do not know where this blog will lead, but I do know for now that this is the medium I have chosen to express my thoughts and emotions. No longer are they solely political as they have been for so long (Check www.southend.wayne.edu if you want to see my political stuff. I was a columnist from 2002 to March of 04 when I resigned over a freedom of speech issue).   I do hope this blog helps other desis who are lost in their own communities and are not content with the American Dream, or should I say Desi Dream of becoming a doctor (money printing maching), reproducing, and dying. I would like to think there is more to life than those three acts.   Now I find myself single, without my love of three years, where so many of our plans for the future were spelled out. It is a painful lesson not to plan everything in life because things don't fall exactly where we want. But in this new "life" I hope to pursue many of the non-political dreams I had. Hopefully, politics will always be around the corner, as I am tired of seeing the hunger and the death, and am tired of being a victim of this society's downfalls as well. Hopefully in a better world, wanderers, strangers, odd-balls--call us whatever you like--will no longer have to dwell in cyberspace, but be able to walk freely with happiness
