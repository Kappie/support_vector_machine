Personally, I knew him, but wasn't really friends with him, so not much was destroyed between the two of us.  If anything, I just hate him more.  Why?  Well, his own hypocrisy for one.  Apparently, he was afraid that I would hate him, so he did what anyone would do, he'd try to make conversation.  I can understand that.  If someone might potentially hate me, I know I'd try and make small talk.  See, he failed at that though because he's saying something, such as, "So what's new?" while either... a) Holding hands with my now ex-girlfriend b) Embracing, in some way, my ex-girlfriend c) All of the above.  In general,  A WHOLE LOT OF PDA . Here's a word to the wise: Don't try to get on the good side of your girlfriend's ex (assuming you have logical reason to try, such as in my case) by shoving his face in it.  You'll only end up with another enemy.  So I've avoided the two of them.  Frankly, I doubt they'll last.  Call me biased if you want to, but I'm not the only one who thinks it too.  People who know him better definitely think it too.  Plus, I guess he liked her the entire time we'd been going out (from our school's homecoming dance until the breakup) and "it hurt him to see us and our PDA."  That just sounds like a whole pile of bull to put it frankly.  Sounds like he's trying to milk physical affection out of her by amplifying a small ping of pain in his heart.  Then again, I do hate his guts and want to see the both of them emotionally suffer forever, so maybe my interpretation isn't the best one :D.  Certainly looks that way though...  Anyway, it feels like only two people (if any at all) read this, so right now I feel  reeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllly  stupid posting all of this :D.  Maybe someone will randomly find it, I know I'll try and advertise it a little better.  Oh well, I'll post again tonight if I feel like it or tommorow for sure.  Welcome to my sad, little world.  Enjoy your stay :D.  'Later Andy
