I've also learned I have to begin stalking these websites like it was a Wilco chatroom cause jobs are disapearing like mad.  One company had a job posted for Silicon Valley for about a month.  I went back to check and it was gone, but the same job opened up in Seattle on the 10th of this month.  I revised my cover letter and found out it was not up there today!  Crazy.  Also unbelievable is that a company that pulls in over 5 billion bills a year isn't hiring...  On the plus side, I got an email from a girl from my rhet class informing me that a job is opening up at a publishing company in town.  Fortunately I was on the ball and the editing test should be coming in anydaynow.  Most solid lead thus far.  I think money would make Champaign managable.  Oh yes, I also had an ultrasound on my stomach today.  Its gonna be a boy...or it's just a mass in my small intestine.  Considering I'm a guy, my money is on the later.
