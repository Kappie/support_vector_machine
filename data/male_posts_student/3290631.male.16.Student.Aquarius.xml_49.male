The week is almost over and I don't have to go to gym today because I'm emergency tutoring a kid who is literally gonna fail his math finals.  This kid is such an idiot though.  I seriously cannot help him, he's gonna fail.  I asked him what negative four plus positive four was and he said eight!  Oh well, at least I don't have to get changed.  Next week, I have no school so it's gonna be relaxing.  My birthday's on Tuesday!  The big sixteen!  Five more days!   Countdown to Birthday: 5 Days
