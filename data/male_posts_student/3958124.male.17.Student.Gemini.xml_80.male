Geesh who does a guy have to kill in order to become a mancurist. Anyway im working at Johnnies foodmaster where I signed up to be a proud member of FEMBA (oops eric) ahahahah. The job is pretty good, i dont have to think at all. Old people suck ass though, all they do is bargain hunt and complain. Bitch does it really matter if u get 35 cents off the 45 cans of catfood u purchased. Besides workin ive just been chilllin and relaxin driving around. I officially have a car this sunday. A 1992 V6 toyata camry hooked up with an mp3 cd play its fuckin izzzzzill. The Movies this summer have all been really good. Spiderman fuckin blew my mind, Harry Potter was 5 times better then the 1st and 2nd, Farenhight 9/11 was really good, I Robot was suprisingly good, and NAPOLEON DYNAMITE was the funniest movie ever made. If u dont see it u will die and become a ghost because ur life really wasnt complete. "KID: What Are you gonna do taday Napoleon? Napoleon: I'll Do whatever I feel like GOD." AHAHAHHAHHAHA so fuckin funny. Lets see summer reading is going good because ive read 2 books Maus 1 and 2 comic books. I still have ap phsyc and history stuff to do but i can do it. ANYWAY thats my exciting life and remember "Start at the top at Blains!"
