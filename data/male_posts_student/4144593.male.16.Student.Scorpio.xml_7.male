Really, not joking, it's real. I'm not tryin to act dumb or stoopid but i'm really failing it. At the way things seem to be going i feel i so gonna fail. I feel so depressed rite now, i regreting now tt i been slackin too much realli. I regret bout so many things but i realli cannot make myself change my lifestyle.I cannot even survive this semester how can i survive the next, biochem and all the stupid modules tt got to do with biology. I dunno a shit bout biology (well except the chap on reproduction) ... But actually i been thinkin too much ... i dun even think i can survive this semester. Must work harder liao.  CEP test today, sure fail so lets fast forward to after tt. Went for lunch at north canteen, the moment i walked into the canteen i saw this gal in pink colour sweater and immediately i noe tt it must be tt Varin liao. Wat luck, of all the dayz, god had to choose this day for mi to see her. Wanted to act like i didn't see her(not very freindly even to some1 who u don't like; yeah ppl i noe) and moved on. Tough luck, ashley and edmund were seated next to her and they were much more attentive then the blur queen. They called my name so i had no choice but to turn around. Apparently all eight of the ppl seated there were my frens. They asked mi to join them but i rejected them. It's not realli nice to pan sei the guyz n beside tt varin was oso there. so i moved on and sat with the guyz. Ate chicken rice,omg it was so funny, i finished my meal n all the rest of the guyz were still queing up for their yong tau hu. Com n it lesson next, i called edmund as he said he was free and wanted to cum to the leture to tok to mi. But when i called him, he was already playin pool at AMK. Slept through the boring lesson. Next up CEP, already fucked up with the subject liao so i just slept through it and tok with the gals a little. I dunno if i'm just too sensitive or wat but i feel like i'm always left out. Went to play table tennis next. Played until 6pm and called edmund again. Wanted to ask him out as i had nothing to do for the evening. But apparently school of business had their graduation cermony today so they  had the day off. He was already at cine liao, i was a little pissed at him for not tellin mi earlier.  Went home after tt, at the interchange, i saw this very very long queuefrom the interchange to the mrt station. Tot some1 was giving away free gift so i went in front to see wat was going on. In the end i had to join the long queue cuase as things turned out, tt queue was for bus 72 which is my bus home.   Edmund- wah u very vulgar leh.... u tio affected by ashley liao ...... Today u pan sei mi huh win liao lor ..... Ashley - wah liao who ask u tell weimin bout tt gal 1 ... u noe he nearly spilled thing out in front of my classmates ...... lulu - bo liao lock ur bloc ......
