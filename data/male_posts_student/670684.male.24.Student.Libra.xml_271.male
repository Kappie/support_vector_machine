I'm not as sad about the staff, which is bemusing...maybe because I believe I will work with them again.  TIP is incestual or fraternal, whatever floats your jetsom better...I'm the honorary TIPster for life.    Yesterday we put brown sandwich bags up on the wall...one for each student.  The idea was for people to write annonymous nice comments about the person and your interaction with them over the past two weeks and put it in their bag...a last bit of inspiration before our experience together ends.  This is the kind of stuff I love doing, but I was swamped with cooking and a slide show to do yesterday that I didn't even start my comments until midnight.  I was only able to get 11 written last night, taking 2.5 hours to do that.  I did the same number in 20 minutes this morning...but there were 12 people or so who didn't get comments, not to mention the staff (half of whom left before I got back from the last trip to the airport).  Anyway, I can't think of any better way to define this experience, so here we go with the comments to me   By the way, the slide show was spot-on.  80s music carefully designed to elicit pathos and tears.  12 kids asked for copies.  Two were crying well after it ended.     Comments  (edited for your pleasure...I'll do my best to leave enough high school antics in them to make it authentic, but not too much to bore)   Rolin...you are funny, witty, and intelligent, and incredibly understanding...and like I said, tell me where I can see your movies!  ROLIN!  You taught me that even members of the Risk cliques can grow up to be really, really, really cool...you won't lose any awsomeness 20 years down the road.  I still have that couple in my room   It's an inside joke, but from one of the quieter members of the camp, who broke out of his shell about five days into the experience and today came up to me and said  What am I going to do when I get home?  No one will expect me to talk!   I told him I was going to make a film called  Too Excited About Uday , as he played Uday Hussein in our Mock Trial (you'll recognize him from the earlier picture, with the towel on his head and marker smears on his face...name is Matthew Clayton so he can search himself on Google)   Thank you for being so welcoming, even on the first day.  I (heart) U.  enough said.  you're so fun.  You did a fantastic job as our RA this year.  You made camp really fun.  Thanks for sorting through the trash with me!!   I helped this guy, Sam Ranson (Google search enabled), look through the Wake Forest cafeteria trash for 90 minutes at the beginning of camp so he could find his retainer.  He didn't.  We had the greatest time.   Rolin, dude, you were fuckin awesome.  Never quit this job, you really can change so many lives other than mine   So did I change his, or can I just change others?  =)   Thanks for everything.  You were the best RA a kid could ask for.  You are one of the funniest guys I've met.   If you're going to post in the comment section, don't do it to take issue with her comment.  Just let the irony sit fresh for a few moments.   Thank you for putting a smile on my face.  You are cool and interesting.  You are probably the best driver that I rode with.  ROLIN!!!  I love how you know all of those fun facts.  You're hilarious and always added a fun sense of excitement to everything.  You have so many talents.  Thank you for sharing all of them with us.  You are a great friend, actor, chef, and you are also a wealth of knowledge.  Thanks for being a cool guy and giving us some freedom.  You are definitely the coolest RA I have ever had.  Thanks for being our main source of entertainment (in the movie and tolf sense too).  You were a fun RA.  No basis to judge =)   I'm not trying to stroke eternal ego here...this experience keeps me without words...I want to muse about the past, the future, and where these two weeks will stand over time.  On my way back from the airport, I got the tight throat, where the vocal cords suddenly send out a pulse of pain, and you want to swallow but you just gulp...I used to get tight throat all the time:  when a camp would end, when I would leave a vacation, or when a friend would move away and we exchanged an awkward goodbye.  My last experience with tight throat came the night I left Centenary, when I drove around the city because I couldn't handle sitting in the Canterbury House looking at the walls and already missing the campus just a few feet away.  I moved to Austin, experienced dire poverty, and lost tight throat abilities in any endeavour.  Until today.    One of our couples, James and Lauren, had a tough goodbye this afternoon.  He lives in New York and is Catholic, she in South Carolina and Jewish.  They were one of the cutest groupings I've known, and with watching them grow and foster love, I also got to watch their time-mandated departure.  It was tough, it looked tough, and it played out like a scene from  urlLink Green Card , where Andie McDowell runs after Gerard Depardieu at the end, knowing that there is no more but pain because of inevitable loss.  Tonight will hurt tremendously for both of them.  So will tomorrow.  And one will fall out of love with the other quicker, causing a last moment of sorrow, and most likely quelling the relationship for good.  Or maybe they'll just succumb to time and distance, slowly fading into a corner region of memory that returns every year around this time, or at the drop of a specific Don Henely song.  But they'd rather feel this pain right now than feel nothing because there was no good to lose.    Last night we all got up and shared something with the group before we signed a document regarding our two weeks here, the projects we worked on, and what we hoped we accomplished.  I was haraunged into talking a little early, and didn't have my mind set on what to say, so I flew through a pretty low-key statement that I regret.  There was so much more to say.  So I say it  urlLink here .  Anyway, some people said some wonderful things, the staff were quite insightful, and these last few notes from my bag are the most telling, for a myriad of reasons.     Not only are you incredibly talented with films, etc., but you are so kind, intelligent, and funny.  Your being here added so much to the mood.  You helped me have fun.  I will never forget playing Monopoly with you (and how you gave all our money away!), your singing and dancing, the wonderful bedtime story (Haha!  I will tell that one to my kids).  You will be so successful.  I am truly going to miss you.  Score it as a "B" in the future.  You're my favorite.    Stay nice.   At 23, I am experiencing the best summer of my life.
