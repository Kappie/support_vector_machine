It was kinda fun, but I was playing a girl part...again.  For those who don't know, I played a cross-dressing German maid, and I played Curley's wife in a scene from Of Mice And Men in English class. Funny, cause the girls cheered at me after I played that role (maybe they pity me). I guess you can say I've become accustomed (sp?) to playing a woman.  LAN party at my house in just a few days! I'm so excited! I'm actually having 2 partys this summer, the LAN party, and a cast party for the people in the play. Fun fun fun.  That's about all for now. So, catch you all later! ---Ben B, who's going to Wichita, far from this opera forevermore. Mood: Happy Listening to: White Stripes - Elephant Thought: "Who wants a body massage?"
