Those of you that love Utah to death, its probably because you fit into the category of the judgemental people that own the stupid state.   Welcome to the Utah State of mind.    1. If you arent mormon. Your not my Friend.   2. If your momon and you screw up, i will gossip about you until the day your caskette is placed into the ground and sacrament hymns are sang around your grave. While they sing. I spit.   3. Got a problem in your life? No REAL Utahn ever has problems and shows it, naturally, so im going to talk to  everyone  around me and tell them about your problems and my view on it. This makes an awesome discussion.   4. If you dont cruise in a bentley or your making $120,000+ a year, your automatically pig trash and deserve to be fed to donkeys and sent to a zoo to live with alligators.   5. if  I  think theres something wrong with your family, instead of being nice and helping you, im going to make it seem like all you do is leech off other people and demand support.   6. Need gas for the lawn mower? WELL GOSH DARN NEIGHBOR, GO AHEAD AND TAKE MY GAS CAN, INFACT, DRAIN THE GAS FROM MY CAR, I TRUST YOU WITH ANYTHING BABY.   7. If you arent like me, and if you dont act like everyone else, your automatically weird and i dont want to be seen with you.  You know, traveling out of Utah you see what your missing out on. Neighbors that arent closed minded, people who genuinely care about you without the fake love bull crap. People here maybe will learn not to be so closed minded and  maybe  stop judging before they even know the person.  For instance the guys at davis junior high, those guys ROCK. Their awesome people but its intimidating at first when you meet them... why? Because of what everyone tells you. Because of all the gossip. Because people cant learn to treat these kids like human beings, and i've gotta tell you, thats the worst thing of all.  Do me a BIG favor please, if you know someone that acts like this then GET AND ENVLOPE. STICK THIS LETTER IN THERE. AND PUT IT IN THEIR MAILBOX. Infact im going to make it easier for you. go to  urlLink Here  and you can print off a copy of this to pin up in your room, and maybe even give to someone who could use it. Lets change Utah because its seriously bugging the heck out of me. Now dont get me wrong, some utahns are nice and dont act this way, but if your offended by this, then your probably one of them that is. KINDEST REGARDS Zack D. Shutt
