The effects in this movie are great, not near as good as in Spidey 2, but still great. The same goes for the story, acting, writing, directiing, everything is done well. Spider-Man is obviously a character who took much better to the big screen than some big green dude I know (ahem, Hulk).   I thought they did a great job keepthing this film close in line with the comic book, which I really admire and give them credit for.   Now I may be a little biased because I love Spidey, but not too much, it's still a great film whether you love him or hate him.     Rating:  4.5/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M
