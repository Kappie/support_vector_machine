In their first few years, the band’s cult popularity was fuelled by their apparent disregard for the media, while other bands were answering interviews and going on tour Belle  Sebastian retreated to their huts in the mountains and lazed about with a selection of good novels. Admittedly I made that last bit up, but it’s what I’d like to imagine them doing.   urlLink Belle  Sebastian – Get Me Away From Here, I’m Dying   When I first heard of Belle  Sebastian their bizarre name - it actually comes from a French television series about a boy and his dog - threw me; I was expecting a sort of Carpenter-esque duet. It turned out they were nothing like the Carpenters; in fact Stuart Murdoch, theband'svocalist,has never even sung a duet of any sorton a Belle  Sebastian record. Get Me Away From Here, I’m Dying, like the rest of their excellent second album,  If You’re Feeling Sinister , is an understated folk-pop gem. Throughout the album the band shows an incredibly astute sense of lyrics and a sharp wit; this song feature my favourite couplet of the album as Murdoch almost cheerily notes: “Nobody writes 'em like they used to/ So it may as well be me.” Belle  Sebastian have since gone on to become less media shy and even performed a commendable set at this years Glastonbury. Their more recent albums have become increasingly “conventional” and, whilst the albums following  You’re Feeling Sinister  are good own respect; the band have never really come close to equalling the endearing characters and beautiful melodies they created on their 1996 album.
