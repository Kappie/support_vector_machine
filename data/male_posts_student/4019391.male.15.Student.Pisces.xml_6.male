However, it started to rain just minutes after stepping into school. Wad luck!! Still, we had to practiced our drill uder shelter though. Later, with a few other bb boys n officers, we went for lunch. My lunch was horrible. A plate of rice with 3 other ingredients cost me 6 bucks. Very Expensive!! Took a cab home with Sean and he dirtied the whole cab with the crumbs from his bread.Fortunately, the taxi driver was blur. Haha. Saw the damn Chris online and he talked crap and fish. Hehe!!!
