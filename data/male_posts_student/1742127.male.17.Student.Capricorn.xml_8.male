LoL Wednesday I'm going to the lake! Woohoo! Swimming! Finally!!! :D:D:D Mikey and Ross get to come over tonight! I'm just happy I finally get to see my Mikey!! :) It's been a long long time! :D A whole 5 days! LoL We have a basektball game tomorrow night. And it'll be a here game, so that should be way better than driving for an hour or so. LoL Well, gonna go! Adios! ~ChRiStIn
