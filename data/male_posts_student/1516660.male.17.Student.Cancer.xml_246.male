Why couldn't they vote off Burton/Jon?! Those two opportunities were the best time to vote those idiots off. Howeverr, hope is revivied next episode, where the commercial said that the girls were discussing to vote off the pair of cocky males. Heh. Lets hope they act on their decision!!  I am so excited! Tonight's Star Awards! Who will win? Who will lose? I am so hoping for Mo XiaoLing to win Best Supporting Actress. This is her best year. This is when her career leaps off! She played Mo LingLing very well. I am so crossing my fingers! Who would I like to see win too? Chen LiPing as Best Actress, Xie Shao Guang as Best ACtor, and Huang Wen Yong as Best Supporting Actor. Oh!!!  Hm. I think I end this le. See ya later! Bye bye!
