And the autoparts store just a few yards away from me...closed 5 minutes ago. So I grabbed my backpack (I just finished class and was heading home) and started walking for an Autozone I know of that's open 24 hours. Probably is its 3 miles away. So for 2 hours I walk to and from. Return trip was rough, my feet were in pain and blistering. I was hauling the coolant too, which just felt like a ton at that point. Eventually I made it back to my car, added the coolant, started the car, and headed home. I went to unlock my door...the key didn't work. My damn apartment had the locks changed again! I walked again...to my mailbox and got my new key. So now I'm home...I don't want to walk anymore.   Added Later : Thanks to my exhausted body and sore feet, I lost my balance and fell down the stairs. It hurt!
