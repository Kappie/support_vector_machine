Arrived at 6+ pm and then settled down at the swimming pool while listening to Zi Qiao's lame jokes. The others went to Jun Hong's house to play. Outcast.  After some time we were allowed to eat the otahs. The sec 1s were busy helping themselves while Kelvin and I took 10 and 7 for ourselves respectively. When the other guys came down from Jun Hong's house, there were only 5 otahs left out of 60. I was also enjoying my second helping of mee when they came. After eating, the fun began.  Gleen Sim went into the swimming pool knee deep and began splashing everyone with water. We took empty water bottles and plastic bowls and splashed him back. Shortly the seniors threw Bo Xian into the pool. Both he and his handphone got drenched. Then an unknown person in the choas shortly followed and threw Gleen into the pool. It was followed by a series of a few sec 1s thrown into the pool by Kuang Yong. Gleen who also fell in 2 more times. Everyone was splashed by water except for those barbecuing.  We stopped throwing each other in when Teo warned us not to do so. Gleen's mother also called to clarify some matters which was later settled with an apology. Everyone forgave each other. Later Bo Xuan and Bryan also showed us some combustion tricks using bottles and a lighter and it was damn fun and nice to see. Oops, forgot, a sec 1 got pumped by Bo Xuan for splashing water. I also got to see burning ice and some fire tricks.  Went home at around 10:45 pm and reached home 20 min later. Watched part of a movie until 12:30am and then went to bed. Woke up at 11am this morning. Got to study for the maths and sci tests next Mon. Signing off......
