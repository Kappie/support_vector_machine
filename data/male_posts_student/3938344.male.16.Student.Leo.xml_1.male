This was the first of 3 total phone calls by this person, each about 30 minutes long, that we got during my shift, out of which I got the honor of taking all 3 calls, due to my closer proximity to the phone.  This lady was definitely a senior citizen, definitely an immigrant from India, and definitely unwilling to have things any way but her own.  I work at a golf shop on a walking course -- and by walking, I mean not only no carts available for golfers, but no carts allowed to any but employees of the shop or the camp held on the same course.  She didn't like this idea, insisting that she be allowed to use one because she was partially disabled (she had a metal hip).  Every time she called, she asked the same questions, and it got to the point where it asked me if I was angry (I was pretty frustrated, explaining everything for the 3rd and sometimes 4th time) and then accused me of making fun of her because of her age, even though I was just trying to not scream at her.  I finally made her understand, but it took around 2 hours of my life.  What a waste.    While I'm working, we had the radio on (the main 3 ways of passing time are listening to music, watching crappy daytime TV, and comandeering the carts reserved for maintenance -- especially that one without a governor! Yeah joyriding!) and I noticed something.  I was listening to the stupid commercials, most of which I heard for the 6th time that hour, and while I was listening to a Navy commercial I heard a very familiar tune in the background.  Not until I heard the distinctive drumbeat did I realize that it was none other than the intro to "Awake", one of Godsmack's most popular songs!  What a strange song to use for a Navy commercial...or, for that matter, for a commercial, period.  After work, I went to a Borders close to the shop because I had a fair amount of time in between when I finish work and when I got picked up.  There, I found one of the greatest bargains for a full-length, pretty old but still totally awesome CD.  I got Alice in Chains' awesome self-titled CD for an incredible $12 -- actually the normal price of a buck a song.  Now, that doesn't seem like that incredible a deal, but when you consider that I paid $21 for Godsmack's self-titled, unedited version (I hate edited music. It takes that important part of the song out) and that it is the longest CD I own (clocking in at 64:15), that seems like the fucking Louisiana purchase, considering how many people consider AIC as some of the founders of the modern metal movement.  Whatever inspired the pricing comittee at Borders to lower that one, it was founded in none other than the Savior, Jesus the Christ.  Nothing short of that could have inspired them to do such a noble thing.  There is some hope for humanity after all...  No, I lied.  There's no hope.  But I got a cheap CD, and that kicks ass.  That'll do for today.
