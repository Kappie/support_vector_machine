'Cause then I'll have a file, that I can file away for easier reference. That would be much better than digging through stacks of papers.  As you can see, I'm still  learning  how to study. Well not so much study, but archive and store what I study so that it's more easy to reference. As an undergrad if I forgot something, it wasn't really a big deal. Now I need to sort of build up a body of knowledge. Eric told me that saving notes will save me time later when I have to teach, and I think that perhaps I should follow his advice. I'm already seeing the benefit, as I can easily pull quotes out of my  digital  notes for use in papers.  After seeing how my page comes up on a different screen and version of Internet Explorer... I want to make some tweaks to the HTML. I need to add line breaks following in the archive section, as well as to take into account older browsers with poor stylesheet support.  I've got the munchies... I only had 1 small bagel and some fries today so far.   I forsee pizza for dinner tonight.  ***
