I like it, anyway.   I'm also in the process of writing this sweet song. I mean...its really cool! Well...I like it. The lyrics are real deep and meaningful to me. And the melody just totaly follows the songs meaning.   Ok, the ideas for the novel are rocking. Right now i'm just kind'a brainstorming for it and getting prepaired. I'm making it a goal to start outline by august 1st. I'm going to have the main character's profile completed by the end of this week. That will be a giant step towards outlining.  I really have to run...
