Whether or not you think the same way, or anyone else sees it, you're an asshole. Soon as your end to your highschool career [and it was a career, seeing as you kept coming AFTER you graduated] You became unfunny, pointless, and in lots of ways, illogical. Noone cared about your debates on religion no matter what their grounds on the topic was, and not many people seemed to tolerate you to a level higher than mine to begin with.  I, for one, am glad you left, and am fed up with yours, and plenty of other people's, crap. People who feel the same can keep feeling that way, perhaps through our mutual hate we can become friends.  I had to clear this up, because it was necessary to voice my opinion on you as you seem to have eloquently done in your blog.   How is everyone else doing? ^_^
