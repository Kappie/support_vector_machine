The party who ends up with the most MPs in parliment is then declared the winner, and the leader of said political party becomes our Primeminister. That is fine, while it's not a perfect system, it is surely one of the better ones I had come accross. So. What is my beef with Paul Martin and the Liberal party? Honestly, nothing. Come election time, they may very well be the party that I vote for, so don't go passing me off as some "Liberal-bashing, uneducated kid who knows nothing of anything". In my post, which you clearly misinterpeted, I was simply stating that if, for any reason, a leader is removed from power, another election should be held. In this country, the Primeminister chooses his cabinet, which are the people who essentially run the country. The Primeminister also appoints the Senate in this country. Just in case you don't know, the Senate, which is appointed, actually have more power than the elected Members of Parliment. Since it is the Primeminister that chooses both the cabinet and the senate, it is safe to assume that even though Paul Martin and Jean Cretien are both Liberals, they are still going to take the counrty in very different directions and are going to have differing views on who should be part of their Cabinet. This is the reason why when a leader is removed from power, that a new election should be held; because when the Liberals were last elected to power, they were under rule of Jean Cretien, who had certian goals and visions, which the majority of (voting) Canadians obviously agreed with. Mr. Martin clearly has very different views and objectives for the Liberal party and the country of Canada. An election should be called to determine if Canadians still like what they see in the Liberal party.  And on a more personal note:  I write on this page to encourage healthy discussion and debate. Your comments do not seem to serve any purpose, except to prove how arrogant, unedcuated and just plain stupid some people can be. Your statements contain only opinion. Not that I have anything against opinions, they are yours and you should stick by them, but at least have the decency to support your opinion with fact, logic, and reason. Also, you stated: " Thats just the way it is and you better learn it. " All I'm going to say to that is if every single person in history had that attitude, we would still be living in caves eating grass. Every idean and step forward in the history of man has been a result of someone refusing to settle for "it's just the way things are".
