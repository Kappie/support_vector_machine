I think that (yes, PowerTheFire or whatever the fuck your name is, here's your answer to your question) people should be able to be how ever gay they want to be, even your friend. I have 3 friends who are gay, who gives a fuck. And not all queers are mean, my Mom's friend who's gay isn't mean. Let's talk about lesbians, have you ever seen two lesbians licking each other's clitorises. Now, picture that in your head, its perverted if you're doing what I told you to. But they're lesbians, they're having sex in a way, and that's no different from having sex that is between a woman and a man. Then why can't they get married like between a man and a woman.  JOHN KERRY FOR PRESIDENT!
