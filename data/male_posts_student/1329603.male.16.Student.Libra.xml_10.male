Spent most of today playing DoA2, that's been fun, unlocked Tengu who says things like "THIS IS THE WAY OF TENGU" and such... yeah...  Sam war annoyed about comment with general chest-region, so I'll try not to blog too often about that... sorry Sam....  Anyway, guten abend.  Give peace a chance, Jon Roskilly
