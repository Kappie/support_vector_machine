Even before Bush, the EU had been taking a dangerous tone about becoming the 'counterweight' to America.  I've have always thought that if the EU progresses as planned, we will either be at war (probably a cold one) or maintain hostile relationships within 30 years.  I'm not sure they are interested in being partners, and we surely cannot allow them to become dominant.  So where does that leave us?
