This weekend: Saturday night Running On Empty played a show at the Acadia which kicked some ass, and then went to the Flaming Film Festival at Intermedia Arts With R. H. and M. Them fils were pretty cool, especially Tranny Fags...very hot Tranny porn. Super cool. Yesterday just chilled at home...very relaxing, if somewhat boring.
