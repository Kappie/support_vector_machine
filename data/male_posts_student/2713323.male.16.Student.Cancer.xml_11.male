The school's concert was boring and the only interesting event was the lion dance performance, brings back old memories for me in primary school, was in the troupe, i played the drums. Anyway, i got ignored in school today, yeah, shit happens. Thank god i have my bros. What am i talking about? i always get ignored. I cant wait till school reopens, exciting information awaits me. :D. My pop told me something yester-morning that really left me thinking, its a quote by gandhi. " An eye for an eye makes the world go blind." O well, later.
