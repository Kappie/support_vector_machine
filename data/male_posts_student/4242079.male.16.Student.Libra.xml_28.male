I really should drink my 8 glasses of water a day. Then again, there's lots of things I  should  do. Like eat less sugar. Or become a vegetarian.   I bought my laptop today. Compaq Presario 1500, 512MB RAM, 1.8 Intel Pentium Processor, 40GB hard drive. So I rushed home, ripped it out of the box, and discovered the fuckers denied me a power chord. So I have an uncharged laptop sitting on the coffee table beside my empty bottle of whisky, calling out "plug me in...."   plug me in, power me up, and use me as you see fit...quite the anthem...   urlLink  postCount('dec1602');
