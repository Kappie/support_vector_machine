I shy away from pain if at all possible. I'll tell you what: you let me alone for a while and I'll clean you really well. Deal? Deal.  By the way, the little imprints you're leaving in my bottom lip may seem cute to you, but they make my tongue continually rake across them.  Again, let's compromise.  I won't tear you apart, and you leave the artwork to the Picasso's.   Muchas gracias .      P.S. Your color rocks my face off.
