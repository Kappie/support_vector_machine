You're riding the peaks and valley's of your timeline in fluid motion, kid, way to roll with the punches now. But as much as you're getting swung at I'd say you'd be good at dodgeball.  Or calypso dancing.  In all it's imperfection the everyday conquest is a chore unraveling in branches and chapters, and we're excited for the read; the next fix, but who overdoses with life? Shower in gold and knowledge and find your thoughts spinning negatively, while a man on the corner can whistle an upbeat tune. Like suicide's the only escape for the weary, admiration is the poison of choice for the soul.  Breathing's just a sliver of satisfaction, in this put-on world we digest. You're all made up and ready for your show, but you jest in your quiet, you're a bleeding heart like every fans you touch, and fame is just a word.  Live like a snowflake and be prepared to tango, it's a quick descent but you're dangerously unique. Wait until the dusk for a perfect sunshine, and pose for memory, this is as good as it gets.  And it sounds flimsy to say and all, but happiness is what you make it.
