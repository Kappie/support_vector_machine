I lie. I can. Jaco eat your heart out. Dave, Rosie ...you two piss off; eventually i WILL BEAT YOUR ARSES. My bum hurts. I am covered in paint. I helped my mum do a poster. Whether I helped is as dubious as the spelling of it...I..T..take your time getting that one. No one is there to watch you fumble around desperatly trying to find it's meaning. thats the beauty of reading on your own rather than watching TV. tday was english literature, I'm all punctuated out, this is my excuse for my poor english and unlegibility for the time being. Next week I shall fake a sprained wrist to cover. Hollie if you ever view this; are you going out next friday; I may join you.        Currently I am listening to The Used. They are beyond a doubt pretty ok. Anyone who states otherwise smells like lucy's mum's collection of prehistorical cheese artifacts. Thats a mouthful.   Till next time. Exit stage trap door.
