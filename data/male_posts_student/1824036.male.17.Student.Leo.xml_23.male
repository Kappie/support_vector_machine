Stone Cold's team lost, meaning Austin was fired from his job, leaving Bischoff to run rampant all over RAW, right?  This afternoon, I was thinking that after The Rattlesnake was done with his book tour (and c'mon, that's really what this whole thing's about, right?) he'd show up on SmackDown! to be a foil for Paul Heyman.   Then, after watching RAW something else dawned on me...  First, Bischoff fires HBK.  Then he fires Lita.  (And what a great angle that was, by bringing Matt Hardy v1.0 back into the fold...poor Shannon Moore.  Now he has nowhere to go but OVW.)  I'm seeing a scenario where over the next few weeks, Bischoff either firing folks, or forcing others to quit (RVD comes to mind...you know Orton is going to get the I-C strap soon.).  Then, creepy things start happening.  I dunno...masked wrestlers jumping the heels in the ring, unknown assailants trying to run over or "cause accidents" in the back.  Stuff like that.  As it progresses week by week, we find it's Austin and his fellow fired folk trying to take over.  I think that'd be a great angle, don't you?  OOOH! OOH!  I KNOW!!   The group could be called "REVolution"!  (I just thought of that...)  Also, I'm shocked, SHOCKED that HHH would job to Gill..., um, Goldberg on two straight PPV's.  Aint that some shit!  Actually, I see some good coming out of this.  Seeing as how Trips has mowed down and buried everyone on the RAW roster, letting Goldberg run with the ball may not be such a bad idea after all.  Already, we're seeing the start of a Kane-Goldberg feud, which is overdue if you ask me.  I say, let Goldberg bury some talent for a little while Paul Levesque-McMahon plays backstage politics.  This may be an oppurtunity for some fresh storylines, something which RAW has seriously been lacking.    Also, I shoulda known that Kane would have something to do with Undertaker's dirt-nap.  There's your Wrestlemania XX Hell in a Cell match right there.    On Thursday, I'll post some SmackDown! post Survivor Series ruminations.
