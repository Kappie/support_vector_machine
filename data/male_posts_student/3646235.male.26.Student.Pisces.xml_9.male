If you can get through the planning, then the worst is over.  Man it's stressful.  And I'm not even doing most of the planning.  I am in charge of the honeymoon.  That's a secret, but I gaurantee she'll love it.  Sometimes I wonder if she's quessed where we are going, and I catch myself at the last second before I spill the beans.  I'm looking forward to the wedding, then things can calm down around here.  She's also a graduate student and under a lot of stress with her research.  I don't think I'm under as much stress as her and the little I do have is sometimes hard to deal with.  Anyways, I think the wedding will be wonderful.  We're meeting with a priest this weekend, part of the requirements to get married in the Catholic church.  I highly recommend it, even if you're not Catholic (I'm not).  It has been great learning about how to communicate with your partner.  In fact, we had a talk last night.  I'm worried about the attention I get from her (me, a guy, worrying about affection!).  She gets so stressed with work that I take a backseat sometimes, which is fine, I know she has to work.  But it's the little things she can do, like run her hand through my hair when she passes by.  One of the things we're working on with Father Ed. is putting the other person first.  So, I'm trying not to let it get to me.  I'm doing a better job with it.  I get to meet (hopefully) with Father Ed alone tomorrow to talk about faith.  I haven't discussed that yet here, next week.  I'll let you know how it goes with Father Ed.  I'm currently reading C.S. Lewis "The Great Divorce".  It seems to help me make some sense of it all, but more on that later.  What's coming down the road (thing's I'll be discussing later): Crisis of faith. My hot temper. Ella.  Oh, the word of the day is: avail - to be of use or value
