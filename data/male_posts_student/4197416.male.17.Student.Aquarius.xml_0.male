What I do is copy all of my CDs to it and buy music online and transfer the songs to my iPod. Up until now, I could only buy music from iTunes, which is from the same people that make iPod (what a surprise). But now Real came out with a store that is compatible with iPod, and for a limited time songs are 1/2 price (49 cents). So I bought 20 songs from them and transferred them to my iPod and they work. Apple's songs are .99Â¢ too. So I switched to RealPlayer from iTunes. Anyway, just wanted to inform you of my money-saving self today. If any of you happen to own an iPod, here are the links to the sites:  urlLink Apple iTunes ,  urlLink RealPlayer .
