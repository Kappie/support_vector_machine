I havnent laughed like that in such a long time... but anyway I hung out with Julie and Ashely... Even though Ashley had her leg problem it was still fun, we worked around it... well we started off the night just haning out at her house... for like 2 hours.. and then we decided we wanted salad... lol.. and went to lonestar.. well we had this kick ass waitress who gave us all this free shit... she just simply said.. oh no problem I'll just bring it out.... it was cool, when she left we would crack jokes about it.. I laughed so hard... *sigh* I'm really glad that I have Ashley and Julie as friends.. there so cool.        so anyway the night then got better as we started to drive around until Jason got off... then we met up at smiths market and it was lame.. so we went on to the first national bank.. and got onto to there balconly like thing.. by driving up the parking garage... so about 5 mintues into being up there, we saw Emily and Alicia driving main in her car... so we yelled and they came up... so we talked for a while.. wasnt really a good conversation... and I feel so stupid talking to them in the way I did (in the nice way :S) because I mean I'm still angry at the both of them.. and no matter what people say Emily and Alicia will always be different to me now... and I'm just waiting for Emily to get pissed off at Alicia again, I mean I'm not saying It'll happen but it just might...well I'm getting off into another story.. back to tonight... so it endend up getting busted by some janitor with long hair :P Alicia and Emily bailed like the bitches they are and left us there.... but we didnt get into trouble... well when we left the bank we decided to try to climb the Wiley building.. ahh the wiley building.. brings back memories.. lol of getting caught.. I will always hear the words "Taylor look at this rock I found...." lol well when we got in the alley we had to pull the fire escape ladder down.. we finally got up to the top.. in the process of climbing a shit load of stair... one tall ladder.. two short ones.. and seeing Julies skirt flying up over her head... :P well all of that was so worth it... seeing the view of Hutchinson was so beautiful... and it was worth it because for a split second or two.. I felt like I was in New York city... *sigh* well we finally decided to get down when we heard police sirens lol it scared the shit out of us... so we flew down the stairs like 3 bats out of hell.... it was so cool that it was lightening and thundering.. plus it was sooo windy I felt like I was in a horror movie.. lol well when we got down the the bottom Ashley was still there.... lol I give her alot of credit staying down there alone... because she could climb up with her knee... I felt so bad for leaving her down there... lol it was so scary all the wind was blowing around trash and making the big dumpsters make loud noises by their lids banging around... lol she told us she was just waiting for some drunk serial killer to come out behind a wall...  lol...  but anyway.. tonight was good night... tomorrow Jason is coming over.. and then we will probably hang out with Julie.. I hope shes not getting tired of me :P I also need to go to Target to get an interview.. I pray to GOD that I can get a job there!! I need the money so bad...  Well I'm really tired.. I'll have to type more tomorrow.. I still have so much on my mind that I need to tell... bye for now                                                                                                                                                              nyny
