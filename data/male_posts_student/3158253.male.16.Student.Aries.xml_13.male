We are stronger, and are better,  Under manhood's sterner reign:  Still we feel that something sweet Following youth, with flying feet,  And will never come again.  Something beautiful is vanished, And we sigh for it in vain;  We behold it everywhere, on the earth, and in the air,  But it never comes again!      `
