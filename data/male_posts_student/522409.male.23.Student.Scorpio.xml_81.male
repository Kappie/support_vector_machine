Even reasonable people who have their own legitimate bones of contention with the current President can't tolerate Moore's baseless, irresponsible, and blatantly dishonest mockumentary, and indeed his entire method of operation.    Otherwise, la vita e bella.  There is a truly amazing woman in my life now who is, against all odds, everything I've ever wanted.  And the great thing is she's crazy about me, too.  I suppose the tables had to turn sometime.  Alright, enough.  I'll drop in again soon with a post that's entirely non-political.  This one just had to happen.
