Life is also not good, because i have a cold.  I even got sick in wrestling practice today.  Though i do get wrestl at 160 tomorrow, instead of 171.  YAY!!!I need my dumb brother to get home so that i can work on part of my final, it is an essay and the rough draft is due tomorrow.  It should be easy though.  Well, that is all for now.  See ya.
