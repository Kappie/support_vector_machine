Â´   I think they're fucking retarded.  Funnily enough, Microsoft appears to have removed  urlLink the page , but luckily, our big friend Google has it  urlLink cached . It's hilarious. (I've also just saved it for future laughs.) Oh, and here's an official Microsoft  urlLink press release  on it.  Some Microsoft employee needs to lay off the drugs.
