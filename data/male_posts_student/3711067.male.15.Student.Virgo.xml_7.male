One after another, Each flower dies, Like human after human, Unheard cries.  But like the roses, A new one blooms each day, With color so bright… As if to say… Something spectacular, That each person can read, From each dieing rose, Comes many a seed.  And the planted shall rise, Come out full force.  Our life like the rose, Sometimes jagged and course, But the outcome is the bloom, Only to fade as the peddles pass.  Looking through a tinted glass… So our memories too faded, Like the coming of age, Minds so jaded, The end passes. Our memories will die, Each peddle, Each Rose, An unheard cry.
