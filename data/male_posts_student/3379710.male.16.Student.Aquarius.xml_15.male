Join the pheonix gang in Varrock. Go to the weapons store and kill the weapons master(You must be lvl 20 or have mith/ammy/silverlight).  Then take the crossbows. You may wait for them to respawn and take more. Keep one and put the rest in the bank. Train your ranged to more than your attack skill if not already done.   With your sword out and leather armor, attack a mage in the wilderness or accept a challenge. Change your weapon to the crossbow(that's why your wearing leather). The mage will have an auto weakness to ranging. He will soon die.   Take the mage's items. Now, you are probably rich and strong. You will be immune to both warrior's and archer's weakness points. You now have only dragons to fear!
