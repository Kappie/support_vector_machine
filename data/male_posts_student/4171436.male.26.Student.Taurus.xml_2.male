It's simply my memorisation guide and I am posting it as a skeleton to build from :) .  [ ***  marks the subjects I don't see so clearly, and therefore might be good places to start discussing from]   de Saussure:      Language is a sign system and therefore comparable to writing and deaf-signing, etc. However, it is  the most important of sign systems    Therefore we can conceive a  science that would study the sign inside social life, Semiology . Such science would be a branch of social Psychology.    Linguistics  would be a  branch  of this science, and Semiology's laws would apply to it and therefore define its  domain as that of human acts .     Prieto      The term Semiology went back to light in  1943  when  Buyssens  decides to go on with the saussurian project . Until hen other linguistics had established laws that not only governed languages, but also other sign systems (and this would be the base).   Buyssens decides that the  limits  of Semiology would be those defined by him as the  "communicative act" . Every act of language is a communicative act but not the other way around. Semiology is, then, an  extended Linguistics     From here there are  two branches  or movements. One of them is centripetal, starts  from Semiology  and uses it  to  better understand  language . It's the  Semiology of communication . The  second one  is centrifugal (was born in the sixties) and starts  from language  to understand, through Semiology,  other acts . This is the Semiology of Signification, or even better,  Semiology of Connotation .     Barthes      ***  We can't say that there are other  systems of signs  that have enough amplitude. As soon as we try to find any with  enough psychological depth , we go back to  language . Objects, images and behaviours do signify, but never by themselves.   *** For example, the  visual substance  uses language to reinforce its signifiers, and at least part of it is in a  relationship of "relevo" (relay)   with the language. Also,  objects  become  systems through language , for it defines its significants and separates its signifiers.  We're a civilization of the written word, so it's difficult to imagine any other system of images or objects whose meaning is outside language. Sooner or later  through Semiology we find language again , not only as a model, but as a component, "relevo" (relay) and meaning. But this is not the same language of the linguist.  Its units are the longer fragments of speech , and therefore they signify "under" language but never without it.   Therefore,  Semiology  might be destined to be  absorbed into Trans-Linguistics , whose object would be the signifying groups made of articulate language. Ergo, we might be able to  turn around de Saussure's proposition : it's not Linguistics a part of Semiology, but  Semiology a part of Linguistics , the part that studies the bigger signifying units of discourse.   From here there are  two branches  of study, the  Syntagmatic  one, which deals with the  analysis of the structure of the message , and the  Paradigmatic  one which takes care of the  classification of the units of connotation.  They come together in the "message", their intersection point.     Jakobson      According to him any communicative act has six elements:  Destinador  ( addresser , the one who sends the message),  Mensaje  ( Message ),  Destinatario  ( addressee , the one who receives it),  Contexto  ( Context , the referent, should be able to be understood by the addressee, and verbal or able to be verbalized),  Contacto  ( Contact , a physical channel and a psychological connection) and  CÃ³digo  ( Code , common at least partly to addresser and addressee).     Prieto     Something becomes an  Index  (indicator?) when from proving that it belongs to a certain class we can derive that another event belongs to another class.  There are three categories:  Spontaneous  (they give indications without having been meant to, such as in nature or involuntary acts),  Falsely Spontaneous  (give indications and were meant to, but must not show that, like an actor faking an accent), and  Intentional  (give indications having been meant to AND show they were meant to do so).   An  autonomous intentional index  is a  signal . The  use of signals defines communication . An  act of communication is when a sender, when producing a signal, tries to give an indication to the receiver . The study of that indication of the base of Semiology of Communication.
