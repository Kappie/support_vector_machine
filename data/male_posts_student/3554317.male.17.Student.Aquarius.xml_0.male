Much merriment was had by all, especially those covered in cake.  I just want something to be different for a change.  Maybe meet someone new in person.  It's easy for me to meet new people on the internet, but in actuality I'm as shy as a mouse, and not the modest kind.  Being more open in real life is something I need to work on, can't be so introverted as I currently am.  Anyway, I suggest the following albums for those who are into music of any sort or willing to push their unpushed boundaries:   Broken Social Scene - "You Forgot It In People"  The Postal Service - "Give Up"  These are probably for the people who don't post regularly on the Questionable Content forum, I doubt they'd read my blog anyway.  I bought my ticket for Modest Mouse, but the person I'm going with has to stave off walking for 6 weeks due to injury.  Not in time for the concert.  Current Music: BSS - cause = time
