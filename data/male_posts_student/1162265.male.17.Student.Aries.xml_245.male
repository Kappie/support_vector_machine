I don't even think the same way, it's only a shame I started this late.    Like the Nangila Poetry Reading thing.  I never actually considered that I'd be helping organize some type of Poetry Reading for some angry black people.  It just never seemed like my type of thing, and I was hesistant at first, but the wonderfulness of Kelz sisters oratory skills gave me a new perspective, so there I am.  Besides that?  Nothing really special.  I guess I could talk about the Music Marathon, but nothing really to say since we came and went and today I spent half my damn waking hours taking a Kaplan SAT.  Gah.
