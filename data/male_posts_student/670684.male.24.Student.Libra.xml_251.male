I read  urlLink Roger Ebert's review  beforehand, partly to justify the $5.50 as well spent, but also to prepare for any shocking or lurid happenings.  They didn't surface, possibly because of my prior dwelling on the subject, but I just don't think the film did a strong job of setting up its payoffs.  It is a distanced look at the plight of the Friedman family, and it is interesting and good because we look at it from a distanced perspective, though a fair share of the footage we see is home video of the family.  The most telling moments in the film are when the family shot home movies of the father and brother before they were to attend trial...looking at the faux levity, and comparing the mother we see there to the mother interviewed in present day, we see firsthand the reality of life's drama.   There was more to say, but it's wiped away in a phantasmagoria of TIP job things.
