But hor, everytime I say English papers easy, I ended up getting a lousy mark. The composition ar, I was stuck between two choices. One is asking you to imagine how you and your friends lives would have changed 10 years down the road. The other was asking you to describe what happened when you cannot find the passport for your journey to overseas. I did considered both questions. I can't make up my mind to do which. Therefore, I turned to the trusty earser for help. Passport story was chosen. Hmm... I wonder if I did well. Hmm, you know. I could probably write the compo for the friends one next time. I wanna write that! The compre leh...was quite average-gy. The summary points were quite easy to pick up, but was quite hard to fit into a 160-word summary. Meow.  Woah!! The SS paper ar. Took me by surpirse! So difficult the questions. All the topics I learnt you know! But their phrasing of the questions took me by surprise I never seen these bfore lor. I kinda panicked...and wasted 10 minutes choosing questions. Oh god. Meow meow! In th end, I chose good governance. Yeah...came up with crap la. SBQ was quite easy. Yeah. I seen the techinques before, so I cna answer lor. Woah lao! I am really hoping for History to save my Humane! Meow meow!  Okie...it's getting kinda late. I am ending this blog le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
