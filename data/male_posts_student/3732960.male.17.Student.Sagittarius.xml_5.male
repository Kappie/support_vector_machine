(Dont get the impression that me and my friends are dirty schwizzo smokers, she got it for free, so what the hell, eh?) then i woke up and called my friend erin and we had to go to the library for a book for my summer school class... then we went to her place and watched the end of Futurama and Family Guy, then i decided to go home  tuesday was shitty. woke up, went to school, came home, watched tv for awhile, then worked 4-9, came home, watched 50 first dates, and went to bed.  that brings us to today. (listenin to the beatles, "Love Me Do" is on) so i had to get up early and get my work permit for alpine valley, and i forgot how long that shit takes and i cant be late for summer school, so i left at 9:15 to get that shit done and got to the place at 9:25ish and realized that all she had to do was sign and photocopy some stuff... so i was going to be hella early to school. i decided to entertain myself and drive out of my way on a cigarette roady.. too bad that only took up 5 minutes of my time. i got to school around 9:40 and sat and ("From me to you" is on now)read from this book SMACK by Melvin Burgess. Its about running away from home and getting addicted to what else... heroin. sounds good, ill keep you all posted. then i came home and watched tv for awhile then listened to music.
