      Yo yo yo. My tyrannical reign as poetry club president continues. I held an officer meeting last night, but used my executive power to have it at a bar where we could watch the stanley cup game. We didn't get much done. Nah, we're going to try to have a reading in a month or so, so I have to get on that ball. I also have to get on the ball of sending out some more poetriums to places and things. Nick, I know you like Eternal Sunshine, but you can't make something your favorite movie until it's been out for a year, at least. You need perspective and a further eye. I'm sorry, but them's the rules. In fact, I won't even supplant Jackie Brown as my favorite Tarantino movie with Kill Bill until I have a year's respite. There are guidelines for these things, you know.  I'm starting to feel really sorry for one of my roommates boyfriends, because he's so nice and naivish and knows nothing about her other boyfriend. Once upon a time I had feelings that could be hurt, so I kind of feel sorry for the kid. There's nothing I can do to help that is within my boundaries, though. On the friend scale Laurie definitely ranks higher than this guy whom I don't even know that well.  You know, I was going to try to comedy up this post, and then I was going to try to serious up this post, but I think I've decided to nerd it up. I am sick and tired of trying to explain all of the reasons why the original Star Trek is much better than Star Trek: The Next Generation. Now, don't get me wrong; the next generation is all well and good, but when it comes down to it it is some goody two-shoes brit flying around putting flowers places, smiling at everybody, some dumb sweet in-joke happens and the strings swell and everybody smiles warmly like it's goddamned Jane Austen in space! Data is D'arcy. I really like it, and I watch it, so people who are about to get offended please don't (Jane), but it pales to the original. In the original the Enterprise strutted through the galaxy finding weird shit on fucked up planets. That's what's so scientific cool about that. There was a cowboy planet, a gangster planet, a roman planet, a nazi planet - you name it! Sure, it didn't make any sense, but it was strange as a motherfucker, and that's what I liked. I love the way when they went to a barren world there was this kind of wind-chimey sound in the background, or how the special effects were the kind of bad level they ended up being good. Just fucked up shit all the time. It couldn't exist in the real universe, but it didn't have to and recognized that. That's the problem with 80s+ trek. It tries to be too realistic. Maybe that's why I like Q episodes so much in the next generation. I don't know. Anyway, that's my rant.  "From Hell's hot, I stab at thee. For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee." - Khan from Star Trek II, quoting some high-falootin' literature
