It must be noted that each United Way branch is independently run, and is connected to other United Way offices in name only.  However, the persons comments about understanding the charity before one donates is well taken, and good advice.  My local office, in Greater Victoria is well known for its integral part in community development.  Without it, many local charities would be unable to survive.  Check out this list of local charities that we support : urlLink Who We Support   After meeting the people, I am confident that they are wise with the money they raise.  However, I must also note that I find it interesting that our society expects the people who do work for society such as United Way are expected to live meager lives, on the lower end of the class spectrum, but our society is ok with paying people such as athletes and musicians excessive amounts of money for their services.  The way I see it, the people, such as those working at United Way in greater Victoria deserve a lot more credit than is given to them.  It must also be noted that if my income is any indicator, the people I work with are not exactly bringing in the big bucks here.  Ciao.
