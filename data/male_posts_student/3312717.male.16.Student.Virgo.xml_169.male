It started earlier, when I was at Battle of the Bands. I took a look around, and I asked myself what the hell I was doing there. From that moment on, I was sick of everyone and didn't want to see anyone else until I felt better. I no longer enjoyed the Battle and left with Erik, because I couldn't believe the kids there. Looking around at the Hot Topic goths, fashion skaters, metalheads, pretentious indie assholes, emo fans, and pop-punks, I asked myself,  Is anything real anymore?  Why does everything have to be a big show? I'm sick of going through the motions with everyone else. I want to  accomplish something . It feels like every conversation I have with another person has been played out and nothing new will come out of it. I'm sick of suspecting everything is fake. I wish I could turn off my natural pessimism, but I always have to see the bad in people. I don't mean to be an elitest, to insult other people, but  I can't help it .  Today I ventured to Brainerd's Battle of the Bands, at first with John and Pammy. I met a bunch of people I knew there (including Fish Boy and Chris Derby!), we talked, it rained, etc, etc. I ended up spending the majority of the time with Erik, some girl Erik brought along, Alex, and Nate Lucas. A bunch of people ended up coming through our particular spot on the grass, though. The music mostly sucked, your cookie-cutter blend of screamo, metal, and pop-punk-emo. It was kinda what I expected, though. Joe's band was pretty good. After Joe's band finished, another band came on, which I don't remember the name of. Anyway, they were pretty talented guys, but their music was contrived and uninspired. You know, radio-friendly pop that the crowd could easily wrap their heads around. Close to the end of the set, they played a cover of Flogging Molly's "What's Left of the Flag to Me". The singer's indifferent attempt to make it a happy tune that the crowd could get into appalled me. This was the catalyst that pushed us to leave. This made me think my main point of tonight: Must everything I love be destroyed, right in front of my eyes? Do I have to watch while every single thing I hold dear degenerates? Can I change it? Is is my fault? It isn't only music, it is everything. In my experience, change around me is almost never a positive thing. Every day I get a little more appalled by what happens around me. I don't want to be hardened, I want to approach each new experience innocently, untainted from life's disappointments. I don't want folk-punk to be turned into pop. This is just a example of everything that happens. Whenever it seems that I have something good going, that I have done something right for once, it melts away between my fingers, and I am left feeling like I didn't personally do enough to stop it. I think it isn't my fault, but it doesn't stop the massive guilt and regret I feel.   Not just looking at the big picture, but in personal relationships. Over time, I ruin or already have ruined my relationship with pretty much every person I know. Shit goes south quite fast around me, I can't help it. When I talk to people, I never say what I really want to say because I am afraid that I will hurt their feelings, or tip my hand as to how I actually feel about things. I usually play my cards close, for no reason other than because I want to. As a result, I suffer. I'm finished with that. I will no longer be indecisive. I might ruin things faster, but at least I can feel right about ruining it.  From now on, I'm not going to dance around and hint at what I truly mean. I've ran out of time to fuck around, and now I'm going to be a selfish cynic, like I've always wanted to. I'm not personally responsible for each failure around me, and I'm going to stop holding myself accountable, right now. I'm going to say I dislike the things I dislike. I'm going to say I like the things I like. I'm sick of all this teenage politics bullshit, and I'm abolishing it. We are all people, not jocks/preps/stoners/skaters/punks/goths/whatever. I'm not going to fall victim to stereotypes. It happened today, and it made me sick. Today, at Battle of the Bands, you could see how much the different subcultures looked down on each other. I do it, everyone does it. Is a little unity too much too ask? We all suffer from the same problems, we just deal with them in different ways.   I can see the end of our energy. We are almost done being kids and I am not going to let being older and more mature dampen how I feel about people and the world. I'm going to keep my sense of urgency and hope, keep having problems sitting still, keep  believing , because in the end I always win and I know it. I  refuse  to let our creativity die, and I'll be damned before I see everyone I know desend into apathy. I won't become jaded, because if you work at it you  can  change how shit turns out.  That felt very cathartic. Thank you for reading it.
