George Bates, an officer in Coastal Division 11, participated in numerous operations with Kerry. In UNFIT FOR COMMAND, Bates recalls a particular patrol with Kerry on the Song Bo De River. He is still "haunted" by the incident:   With Kerry in the lead, the boats approached a small hamlet with three or four grass huts. Pigs and chickens were milling around peacefully. As the boats drew closer, the villagers fled. There were no political symbols or flags in evidence in the tiny village. It was obvious to Bates that existing policies, decency, and good sense required the boats to simply move on.  Instead, Kerry beached his boat directly in the small settlement. Upon his command, the numerous small animals were slaughtered by heavy-caliber machine guns. Acting more like a pirate than a naval officer, Kerry disembarked and ran around with a Zippo lighter, burning up the entire hamlet.   Bates has never forgotten Kerry's actions.   You wanna know something?    I don't care.  I don't care about what happened in Viet Nam, good or bad.  I didn't really care about his Silver Star and Purple Heart(s), and I don't care about some questions surrounding said medals.  Viet Nam was a long time ago, and it really has little bearing on today's situation.  I'm much more interested in what Kerry has done in the Senate, and what he says he will do in Iraq and in the War on Terror.  That gives me plenty of ammunition to oppose him.  This book, and these questions about Viet Nam will have an impact, but I think the country would be better served to let this drop and focus on TODAY.
