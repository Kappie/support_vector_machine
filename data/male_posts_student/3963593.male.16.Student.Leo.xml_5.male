It gives me a feeling of hope in some weird way. It has a good tune, and reminds me of some girls I know. The main reason I put the lyrics up is because Jessee asked me too because I told her the song reminded me of her. I didn't only say this to flirt, but there is also a lot of truth in the comment I made. She just is realizing that she is a beautiful person inside and out, and I greatly admire her for that. I hope more people can realize this as she did, the world will be a much better place. People will be much more happy and confident. Have a nice day.
