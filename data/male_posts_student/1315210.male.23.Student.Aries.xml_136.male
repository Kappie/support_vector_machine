Number 1 rule of washing YOUR car:  "NEVER trust anyone else to wash your car for u..........UNLESS the other person is a professional or u know he can wash cars REALLY well and has prior experience of doing so"  i mean how stupid can a person get to entrust his "limb", his "wife", the second biggest invesment of his life to inexperienced hands?!?!?!?  Number 2 rule of washing YOUR car: quite the same as the first,   "Wash YOUR car YOURSELF"  washing your car is spending quality time wif it........u have to thank it after using it, after all it ferries you evrywhere u go, it keeps u sheltered and makes sure u get home or to the hotel in time for that quickie during lunch hours........and it sits patiently waiting for u to finish your not so quick quickie.........and it is your trusty steed at the race track.........where man and machine become..........one..........washing your car is bonding, pple.............bonding..........  Number 3 rule of washing YOUR car: more or less the same as the first 2,  "Women in bikinis dun wash cars, they only wash themselves........no, they wun wax your car or anything of yours for that matter"  I seriously dunno how pple can find their cars clean after women in bikinis are done wif it..........they lean on the car, they rub themselves all over the car.........they dun use sponges to clean the car, they use their friggin breasts~!!! tho i wouldnt deny breasts are soft and.........nvm.........point is, women in bikinis do not do a good job at washing cars......they end up washing themselves in car shampoo...........now u know why such women have shiny skin, they use wash and wax car shampoos.........BUT let me say this, im not saying pple shld stop such services.............  ok.........final piece, SOME women cant wash cars.........they might know how to wash everything in the house, but they are clueless when it comes to cars.........i seriously dunno wat my neighbour was thinking..........maybe he thought he could get all wet and wild with his girl...........i dunno............u wanna get wet and wild? go take a shower together, that way u can get wet and wild all u want..........maybe she'll even throw in a free wax and polish after washing..........
