Hehehe C picked up the phone and asked for his name. And his name is OSCAR. He is also an Indian and he made the mistake of calling this house twice. Then B taught me some tactics on how to defeat those persistent telemarketers.  Telemarketer:  Hello, how are you sir??  Person:       I'm fine. How is the weather in Mumbai?? (due to his Indian accent)  Telemarketer- says nothing and puts down the phone.  Maybe my way would be more fun. Pick up the phone and wait for the telemarketer to start talking in english then reply "No hablo englais" (which is spanish or portugese for i dont understand english- i forgot which language =P). If he happens to find someone to converse with you in that language you then reply "Sorry i don't understand what you are blabbering about. I only speak english."  So the next time he annoys me, I will guarantee i will win this time. You hear that,don't you?? Youre going down.
