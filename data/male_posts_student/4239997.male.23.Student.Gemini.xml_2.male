Have I wronged people in not sharing my witty banter (of course banter would require additional people communicating between one another, but I think you hear me knocking)? None the less here are my comments on the past couple days.  I have spent most of my free time playing various games on my Xbox with ESPN NFL 2K5 dominating most of my time. I have successfully finished the first half of the season going 7-1 (darn those Bucs) with the Chicago Bears. This is the first year that I have decided to go with a sport genera game and it was not an EA Sports product. I have been an avid supporter of EA since Madden came out with the Super Nintendo, but due to the price ($20) decided to go with ESPN and I have not been disappointed. At first I felt like I was cheating on my girlfriend during high school, a lot of new features that I didn't know existed and the excitement of something new. I thought once the newness wore off that I would get sick of it, but I've played 12 games in a season (4 preseason for those counting) and I have not grown tired of it. The best feature is that I can add my own music tracks to the game which brings me to a question...what is the best music for a football game? Yes, I realize ESPN had a similar article(I will try to find the link and post it for your enjoyment), but I'm asking what song, band, album is the most appropriate for a football game. I am going to mull it over before I come to a conclusion but I would like to hear any ideas.  This is the point in the article I was going to talk about the Olympics, but due to time constraints I will write about my thoughts on that tomorrow. I will touch upon the the USA basketball team, gymnastics, and what I have heard as the lack of interest in it this year. I will also answer what the best mix of music for a football video game is.  Anyway, enjoy the evening and remember to give your support to Paul Hamm. I have a feeling he will do  urlLink well .
