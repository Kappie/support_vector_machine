More poetry!!!  "I'll Never Forget" I'll never forget, The joy you brought. I'll never forget, The pain you wrought. Never while I live.  The late nights, Weary mornings, All those big fights, And little ones too. I'll never forget.  The hellos of spring, Friendships a blossom. The goodbyes that autumn will bring, As the leaves fall. I'll never forget.  I'll never forget, The words we spoke. I'll never forget, The things we said, Without saying a thing. -Friday, February 13, 2004   "I Forget" ideas come ideas go i forget and more ideas come -Friday, February 13, 2004   "Falling Out of Time" Falling out of time, But not existence. You will be back, I know, look at the sky. -Friday, February 13, 2004
