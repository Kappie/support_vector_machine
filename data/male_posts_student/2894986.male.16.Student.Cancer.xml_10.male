Who doesn't want to play the game everyone enjoyed playing on the playground in which you get to throw the ball at another person, except maybe the kid who was always picked last. Kickball has officially reached its pinnacle: a St. Xavier Intramural League. It was announced on Friday and by Monday it was the talk of the school. Itramural kickball only comes around once in a lifetime, so I jumped on the oppurtunity and decide to get a team together. Now my team is overflowing with people who want to be on the team. And unlike my intramural basketball team, we aren't going to suck. So, exciting news, huh? Yeah I know Matt and Greg are jealous. No kickball for you.  And now for an intramural baskeball update. Sadly I must tell you that we suffered our fourth lost of the season. But this one was against a very good team. On the whole the loss was pretty respectable. We only lost by 9 points and had our highest output of the season...a big 28 points. The tournament starts this week and it is very possible we will make it to the semis. Our first round game should be an easy win. Next we get to play the drama team. To bad there is a play scheduled for 2 o'clock that day. Looks like a forfeit win for us.  That would match us up against the team we just lost to. Doubt we'll get a win there but you never know. That would be 4 wins for the season! Wow, never would have thought that we'd even get one by the way we played early in the season.  Well thats it for now. Watch the Lamb.
