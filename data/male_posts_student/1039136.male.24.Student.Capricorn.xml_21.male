Its really good to know that i'm not doing all this work for nothing. ZBT ZETA PI: The Powerhouse is taking over!  from the email  "I wanted to say that we all, well @ least I know, that you have been busting your balls all summer for the sake of the fraternity.  And I appreciate that greatly!  It really makes me feel comfortbale, knowing that no matter what, after this spring I will not be an "active"/partisipating brother in the same level, that when I am gone I will be leaving this fraternity under you and Kevin, and a few others, you all "blead blue  Gold" and thats what we need right now.  It will all be good.  I can feel it.  This semester/year ZBT will truely peak to its hiest potential.  I can feel it, that hasn't been this much posative energy coming from the e board since I don't know when, and school hasn't even started.  its game on now bro!  Thanks     Franky Bod"
