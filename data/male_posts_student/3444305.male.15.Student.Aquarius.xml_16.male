So I'm tired and I don't feel like writing it all over again tonight. So I'll just write it tomorrow. It was a good post too :-(. Oh well, the title was "watch out!" because Andrew got his permit today. That crazy boy. He is an awesome driver though. I got to ride with him! :-). Well I'll right more about it after summer school tomorrow. I have a test sadly.
