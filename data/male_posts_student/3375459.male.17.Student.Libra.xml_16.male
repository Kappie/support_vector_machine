The taste of it is just simply, heavenly. HEhe… I wonder why are there people out there that hates the smell of it.. “One man’s trash, is another man’s treasure”? Oh no.. This is definitely a golden nugget. To those who hate the smell “Try it! You’re sure to find that same nugget of gold underneath the stinking soil”   Hmmm… Before dinner today, I spent almost my whole afternoon watching animeS with my lao er there was  Chrno Crusade, Kenran Butoh Sai The Mars Daybrea and Bakuretsu Tenshi . It really was an amine marathon, episode after episode. It fells great man, I’ve finally got to watch so many episode of chrno I had missed after it has been licensed.   Slack slack slack…. That’s all I’ve been doing.. it rotting at home.. Maybe someday I should get out and explore alone. Maybe not.. I like company a lot… HEheee… wonder who will be willing to lead me =P sigh~ I’m useless aren’t I? I’m going to be 18 soon and I still haven been to so many places in this small country Singapore. Some times I wonder, am I a little  Zhi Bi ? I stay home almost everyday during holidays, doing no more then eat, drink, sketch, sleep.. blah blah blah…. I don’t even know what I want any more. Life has been so unclear. Am I going to live my dreams? I wonder.
