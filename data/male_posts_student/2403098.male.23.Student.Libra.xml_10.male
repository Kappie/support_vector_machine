As you also know, I am lying and have no true excuse.  Last night was a magical night.  A night that only happens once every... once every week actually.  It was Monday.  "Monday?  Monday Night Football?" you're thinking.  No, you are thinking wrong.  You see, Monday night brings with it the promise of a special dining experience at the Boomerang Restaurant here in Norman, Oklahoma.  Every Monday night between the hours of 5pm and 10pm, Boomerang serves up their wonderful Chicken Strip platter as usual, but it is ALL YOU CAN EAT STRIPS for this one night of the week.  Oh the pure joy of it all.  "Where is this story going?" You ask yourself.  I PROMISE to tell you if you stop THINKING in the middle of my Blog post for the love of God.  What was so wonderful is that lauren and I decided that in order to ensure we were receiving our money's worth, we should DEFINITELY have all the chicken strips we could eat.  So we DID eat all the chicken strips we could eat.  The kicker is, we took some plastic containers so that we could shovel some under the table here and there in order to have all we could eat LATER too.  Gosh, how is Boomerang even in BUSINESS anymore.  Oh wait, probably because not everyone tries to scam 6 extra chicken strips out of an all-you-can-eat experience there.  F* 'em.. I'd do it again.  note:  The strips I did take in my plastic baggy were eaten before I went to bed that night.  I believe the grand total was at least 13 strips in one evening if you add those to the total at the restaurant.  BBLLAAARRGG
