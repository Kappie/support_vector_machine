People always fight for their points of view (and that's good), but never consider other people's (and that's bad, really bad). How come people hate when they're not allowed to show their thoughts, but they are never willing to accept ideas differing from their own? Why are people so stupid to the point of doing things they criticize?  Why? Because we're human  (and we need to be loved, just like everybody else does) .  GePeTo
