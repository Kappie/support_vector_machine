I know I've said this a million times before but damn I love that girl. We've been together almost two years now and yet we still can't get enough of each other. How fucked up is that? I've never felt this way about anyone before in my life. She's just so incredibly perfect in every way. Now if I could just save up that $20k for the ring I want to get her.. I bitched all weekend about how I wanted to get married there. Only kidding of course. Ok no I wasn't. Oh and get this, we ended up  blowing around ** $800 ** on eating out alone..in just three days.  Eating was just so much fucking fun. Anyway, on with the recap.        I look retarded. Grace looks cute. Fuck off.     Friday: Day 1    Got up early Friday morning to squeeze in one last workout but soon realized there just wasn't enough time. We never found anyone to look after Bitsy so we had to leave early and drop her off at a pet hotel before heading to the airport. Fifteen freaking bucks a day. Fuck. Finding a place to park at DFW also sucked ass. All the far lots were full so after a half-hour of driving cluelessly around we ended up parking in the $10/day express lot. Double fuck. Our flight was rather uneventful, aside from the fat korean guy sitting next to us watching some asian softcore porno flick on his laptop.       But everything changed once we got to Vegas. Holy shit that town's changed since I last visited. Grace had never been before so that made things even more exciting for the both of us. I just couldn't wait to experience Vegas with her. After checking in at the MGM, we had a late lunch at  Wolfgang Puck's Bar & Grill . I knew Wolfgang Puck had five restaurants in Vegas and I really wanted to try two or three of them..yea I'm a fucking pig. The braised lamb was definitely the shit. After lunch we did some gambling and some more exploring around the hotel.  Video poker and blackjack  are so fucking addicting. Later we got all prettied up and had dinner at  Shibuya  before taking the monorail down the strip. We had gotten tickets for the 10:30 showing of  Mystere  at Treasure Island. Grace had never seen a Cirque Du Soleil production so all throughout the show I kept hearing  "wow!"  and  "oh my god did you see that?"  coming from her direction. She's so fucking cute. My feet were killing me (fucking shoes hurt like hell) so we went back to the hotel afterwards and gambled a few hours before having a late-night dinner at  Studio Cafe .       Saturday: Day 2    We pretty much just explored the strip all day long, checking out some of the newer hotels like the Monte Carlo, Paris, Venetian, and New York-New York. We also had a late morning champagne brunch at the  Aladdin's Spice Market Buffet , which was rated #1 in Vegas. I could definitely see why..damn we stuffed ourselves silly. After more exploring and more gambling at various casinos, we got our scruffy asses cleaned up once again and had dinner at  Postrio . I was kind of pissed we had to wait a while for a table since we had made reservations in advance. Oh well what can you do right? The filet mignon and triple chocolate dessert definitely made up for the wait. The bill was a  paltry $170  so I let Grace take care of that one heheh. Actually, it was my  early birthday dinner  so that's why she paid. After dinner we walked the strip, got me a comfortable  new pair of shoes  at Rockport (I was tired of hobbling around like a fucking cripple), heard a hotel employee yell out " you pick it up, you funny looking fat girl"  to some ghetto-looking black woman walking by, and then caught the 10:30 showing of  La Femme  at the MGM. The show was pretty cool..naked chicks and crazy lighting effects. There was also this incredibly random Michael Jackson skit thrown in towards the end that was just fucking hilarious. Later that night,  Grace won $631  playing the quarter slots..after spending a whopping one quarter. Holy shit that was so fucking cool, especially considering the fact that I kept getting impatient and losing all my money doing   max bets   on the video blackjack machines. After having a late-night dinner at  The Grand Wok  and some more gambling, we headed up to our room and rented  Kill Bill Vol. 2  and some crappy porno. I think we ended up going to bed around 6am. Good times.       Sunday: Day 3    Sunday was just a day of gluttony. After having the champagne brunch at  MGM's Grand Buffet  (the Aladdin buffet was waaaaay better), I felt like a big fucking fatass and decided to pay the jacked-up fee to workout at the  MGM Grand Spa  while Grace got a manicure. The gym was a lot smaller than I expected but it at least had a decent set of weights to work with. After spending a few hours at the spa, we got dressed up and headed over to the  Eiffel Tower Restaurant  to make our dinner reservations. We had an incredible view of  The Fountains of Bellagio , and ended up  blowing $200 on dinner . It's a damn good thing Grace won that money huh? I think that was my first souffle experience ever..ooh la la. Unfortunately, my baby was feeling a little sick afterwards so we decided not to do the  Eiffel Tower Experience . Instead, we checked out all the  fancy-schmancy shops  at the Bellagio and Caesar's Palace before taking a cab over to the  Crazy Horse Too  strip club. That's right, I took Grace to her very first titty bar muahaha. We wanted to go to a "nice" strip club but couldn't remember the names of any of the ones we had seen ads for. I'm a pussy so Grace asked the driver to take us to one of the nicer clubs. The place he dropped us off at wasn't too bad I guess. The $40 cover and $18 drinks (a bud light and a pina colada..geezus) was pretty fucked up, but I guess the girls were decent enough. Some were rather fugly and had either too much or too little ass..but there were definitely some hotties there as well. We had fun  laughing at the horny old fobs  emptying out their wallets for an endless number of lapdances. Oh and the old fat guy bopping around with glowstick in hand was fucking priceless. I wanted to  buy her a lapdance , but after seeing the dancers rub their tits all over the guys' faces and dryhump the hell out of them, she really didn't want one. Silly girl. After getting back to our room, we rented some more porn and picked up some late-night  Mickie D's . I hadn't eaten that shit in years. I felt so fucking gross afterwards.     Monday: Day 4    Monday was rather uneventful. We woke up early, packed up our shit, had breakfast at Studio Cafe, and headed over to the airport to make our 11:50am flight. Neither of us wanted to go home. It had been a dream weekend and we really didn't want it to end. But all good things must come to an end right? Dallas sucks.
