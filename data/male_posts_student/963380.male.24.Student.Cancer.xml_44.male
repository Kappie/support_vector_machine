I've begun a campaign that can be described as nothing more than the utter destruction of one stupid man. Jerry King.  To put Jer.King (as I like to call him) in perspective - this is the chap that tears the crossword out of all our daily newspapers and never finishes them. He argues for the sake of arguing (we're open till nine he says the manager, who replies, the newspaper says ten, to which Jerry replies the door says nine.  urlLink The manager glares and thinks to himself. ) and he's a rude son of a bitch who always attempts to take the moral high ground, even though he lost it long ago. A bitter broken late forty year old man with his sixth (illegitimate) child on the way from his short, rotund, rather homely guatemalan wench. I intend to break him further.  He decided to get into a stupidjerry fight with Jeff today. Brought religion into it, on the floor. Something I've had to chastise him about several times already. I'm writing the complaint to our general manager right now. He has a friend who never leaves the damn store, but never buys anything. His friend enters the store after we're closed to distract and make fun of employees (get a FUCKING JOB you commie pinko bastard!!)  He decided to pick a fight with me again today. I've given this guy the benefit of the doubt for the better part of two years. No longer. It ends today.  The Following People are NOT loved by Jesus: Jerry King. That is all
