IT...had to work like crazy to finish off this damned powerpoint thingo with absolutely no purpose. French...had a test (again) and lots of very annoying and repetetive work. Geography...more homework, had to watch a very crummy video about Osaka bay and all the strange little men who run around it making camera lenses. Woop-dee-doo. And then I had a 30-min detention after school because Mrs Ellis lost my homework. Bah.   Today seems to be the day all those lucky people in the Peru group get back from Buxton. So no doubt Jack will have plenty of stuff to say about *various things*. Things which will lead to me making myself look like an idiot tomorrow one way or another. What a great prospect eh?
