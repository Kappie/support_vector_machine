Anyway, yesterday Andy visited and we walked around downtown, ate at the Roaring Fork, watched  Daredevil  and went to the party at Jeff's.  It was cool. Andy is my first visitor. The Roaring Fork is pretty good, and the place is much nicer on the inside than you would think from the outside. It's somewhat pricey, but I guess the food is good and you do get soup or salad and 2 sides with whatever you order. I was disappointed by the beer selection, because usually those rustic themed places have good beer. It was just room temperature Labatt.  Daredevil wasn't bad or good. The logical gaps just made it annoying and there were some problems with the flow of the story.  The party was good. It was you're usual excessive drinking and talking to fellow grad students or complaining about school stuff type talk. Andy, Wataru, Tami, Ai and I went to Kennedy Fried Chicken around 2:30 AM to get some nuggets. Then Andy and I had to wait around for an hour for a cab to take us home.  Andy left this afternoon after eating at the Phoenician.  So now... I'm at the library checking out books  ***
