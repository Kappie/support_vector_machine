I mean, just look at how fucking artsy and creative I am to have an image like that letting you know that you're not smart and popular enough to be a friend of mine. I also have other pictures. Like of fairies and angels or whatever. I mean, they have abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do with This Journal Being Friends Only, but who are YOU to question my artistic vision? Just observe how effortlessly the template and style of my journal flows with the content. This bastion of perfection is obviously lost on your narrow and short-sighted view of the world. You can comment in a futile attempt to be added, but I will taunt you mercilessly until you leave me and my select group of Chosen alone, as we transcend beyond our physical forms and experience a higher plane of existence.      info.link:  urlLink http://www.subservientpresident.net/   [Listening to: California Sun -  urlLink The Rivieras  (02:26)]
