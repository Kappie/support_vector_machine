Somebody noticed one of my flyers and called, he said he was 23 and looking for a guitarist (I didn't put my age on the flyer, that seems like the only way I will get replies).  I told him my age and he said it was "irrelevant" and to call on Tuesday to have a practice.  I called yesterday several times and nobody picked up, and today as well, still no one picked up.  So once again my efforts turn into a disappointment :(.  I hope something turns up, I'm getting sick of shit not working.  I saw Secret Window with Kate, and it was a good movie.  Depp's character sleeps thru like the whole thing and he has bed head alot and it is funny...well...at least we thought so...  Oh yea, I got a weird IM, some girl IMed me and said, "you dont know who i am but i think you are really hot"  That's a first.  It turned out to be my girlfriend's bestfriend's cousin that just happened to see a picture of me.  Kinda creepy.  My dad yelled at me about the phone bill.  It doesnt seem like i am using that much minutes up though on my phone.  But I am gonna try to cut back.  He said I had 3000 minutes this month.  No, not 300, 3000 minutes.  I dont know where those numbers came from, but I think he is reading the thing wrong.  I'm gonna go, adios.
