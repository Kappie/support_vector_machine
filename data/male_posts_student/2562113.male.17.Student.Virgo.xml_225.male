I went back to state and took 4 more shots of vokda and passed out on the lawn. i was awoken to vodka being poured on my chest. i had to go to class. i stumbled into calc. my professor asked jokingly to smell my breath. i uttered.. "ughh nooooo." i ended up passing out with face on desk 20 min into the class. i awoke and went to eat my first meal. then i passed out in my bed for 4 hours, missing at least 20 phone calls.  it was 9pm and i was terribly hungover . i headed up to the club, then we headed to mcdumpster. food didn't make me feel any better. i showered at 1am, felt better, the st. rose girls slept over.  friday was a ghost town. everyone was mia. i was feeling like crap from the previous night. nothing a little w couldn't cure. met with academic advisor to schedule for classes. the night life was dry. club 21 is falling apart thanks to the UPD and numerous referrals.  i had my 40 oz of malt liquor and everything was good.    last night we had a disco party. i was drunken and under the influence of THC.  I was dancing like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.  pictures were taken of me. it's only a matter of time before they are posted all over the tower by those stupid girls. we then ate massive amounts of food.  pictures and video from fountain day: http://www.albany2go.com/livinghere/fountainday2004.asp  Give me smut, and nothing but!  - R w L super SMUT
