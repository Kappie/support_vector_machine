This new[?] possibilitism [my dear ulrich...] may just be enough. those eternal questionnaires of moral certainties will continue to be.  questions which, due to their subjective nature, forbade finite conclusions and decisive answers demand to be answered none the less. Oh, no fear, they will not go unsatiated. imaginations and advocates for the cloven one will keep it going, at least. fun and annoyance will dance waltzes this summer, serving to add their own presence to the worn paths. which [is it exploring if they've been there first? [oh no, subjectivism again]] may make it fun, surely engaging, to the babe's soft soles.  "it's not like jeopardy."
