Sniffing glue, drinking beer dont give a fuck how the hippies feel this is for you joey your memory fucking lives your three cord wonders made in nyc   gaba gaba hey, punk is here to stay hey ho lets go sniffing glue all day  gaba gaba hey, punk is here to stay hey ho lets go sniffing glue all day  blitzkrieg bop punk is found on the street corner of my home town  they called you dumb the punks heard the noise   cant remember anymore. Enough casualties. King Arthur came out today. Anyways, Lamb Effect actually doesn't play punk, or ska. They play skunk. This is found at their website. urlLink Home of Lamb Effect  Homeless Man is really an amazing song. Gotta work tomorrow bright and early at 930. Mattson and I get to work with Pokegama and Lewis.  Today, right when we were leaving work, Mattson saw this sweatshirt that sad Lewis on the back. He assumed it was Lewis' shirt. So, I looked on the front and it was a Crosby-Ironton Girls Basketball shirt. Not only was I confused, I was struck down with laughter. It was then that I recalled that one of the girl's last names was Lewis. So, Lewis' short run as coach of the CI B-ball team was over.  Tried to fix that cassette deck today. Sat outside during my break and punched it for a while and then tried to clean it. Didn't work. I think it needs a good beating. Here are some upcoming songs on my Playlist. First is Operation Ivy - Bad Town. Then we have some of Led Zep's The Ocean. Following is Nirvana, Clapton and Less Than Jake with The Man Who Sold the World, Layla and All My Best Friends Are Metal Heads. And the list stretches on from there. On this particular program, the highest rated song is Homeless Man. Where is that Song?  It's about half past midnight, i was in an alley it was out of sight I looked around couldnt see but i felt something grab me looked down to my surprise it was a homeless man lying in cardboard and rags pulled out a tin cup and said hey man do you got any change?  hey you there homeless man come and take my hand you can live with me for free  hey you there homeless man come and take my hand you can live with me for free   i asked him what his story was he said he was out on the streets just because no one would give him a second chance now what are you gonna do when no one is willing to help you? or give you a helping hand?  chorus x2  solo  nows he off the streets (MEMORY BLANK)he marches to a new drum a different beat no one tellin him get a job you slob  now hes in a town of his own, a place of his own, a place he that he can call home  because no one would give him a helping hand, hes doing just fine  Keep on typing, typing. Now its 1230. Still going. Bryces tomorrow? thats what I hear. Halo possibly? Speaking of the boxx, this new game that is coming out that is called Fable looks really cool. Now, I know hobie has been talking about it for years, but i only just shrugged it off as microsofts attempt at an rpg to grab some busnass. But after looking at it, it looks really, really fun. It is a mix between knights of the old republic, black and white and diablo. Now, just with diablo and black and white in the mix it sounds fricking cool. I think i spent at least 1000 hours playing diablo. That is a sick amount of doing anything, especially playing a game. I think I probably measure in close to 1000 on wc3. The only thing that could come close to that would be gta and that would only be around 100-400 hours i think. Anyways, fable is an "open rpg" meaning you can do whatever the hell you want, pretty much. There is a linear story line but you can ignore it and do sidequests or just do nothing. Also, the world is heavily effected by what you do. For example, if you kill a person, they are gone for good and everyone associated with that person will hate you. Going with this theme, you become good or evil depending on your actions. So you either hang with the good-to-shoos (???) or you're badass and you kill crap randomly. Although killing crap randomly is very appealing, I couldnt deal with everyone wanting to kill me constantly. I can see myself playing that game for a very long time. In order to do this I would have to get a box, good thing my cousin is selling his for 50 bucks.   Right now this song im listening to is very soothing. It is Sugar in you gas tank by Less than jake. I like it a lot. I think I was talking about King Arthur earlier? I think we should see that, although I think it is going to be a lot like Pirates of the Caribean. King Arthur should have been made like Gladiator, not by Jerry Bruckheiemer who after his last success is probably going for a repeat. If he ruins it I am going to hunt him down and shoot a arrow into his face and then kill him with my sword. Hahahaha. Man, that makes me wish I still had Hellsing on my TiVO. I liked watching Alucard fight the Crazy Priest. That anime is truly cool. It is right up there with Bebop and Trigun in my book.
