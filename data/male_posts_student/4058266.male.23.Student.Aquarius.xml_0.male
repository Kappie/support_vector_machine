She goes "We are having a blood drive and if you could donate some blood for us that would be great, we need some Young   and Healthy men." I was like "Young and Healthy huh?" She was like "Yes (with a smile) some Strong and Healthy men." I don't know if you would consider that getting hit on but I just find it funny because I was just trying to buy a Bible and she's all checking me out. What the hell.
