It was probably the most torturous three hours of my life thus far. The hardest part was not being able to just put my arms around her or tell her that I love her. Those are things I took for granted that would always be there. I guess I was wrong. For those of you out there with someone to love, don't ever take that for granted. Remember everytime you kiss them, it could be the last time, remember that those plans you make for the future, the house, the kids, the dog, the fish, they're not for real. When you wake up hungover in their arms, hang on the them as long as you can.......  The average American falls in love 6 times. No wonder the divorce rate is so high. As soon as you love someone, you can never stop loving them. Sure, they may drop down on your priority list, but you can never stop loving them. To say that you stop loving them means you never loved them at all. But is it really possible to carry on in a marriage if you are still in love with five other people? I don't think so. If I fall in love one more time, and it ends, I think I will live a life of lonliness, just because when I get married, I want to be able to give them everything I have, and not have a past full of other things that I still may or may not be attached to.   it's a lesson learned.
