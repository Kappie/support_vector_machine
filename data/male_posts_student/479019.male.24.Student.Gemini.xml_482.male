I guess we were both cordial to one another. It was weird that I treated her just as if she was as any other co-coworkers, despite me still honestly feeling some animosity towards her.  The good thing is that Steff took my apology and basically said that it'll take awhile before things get normal again. I'll take what I can get. The fear is gone, and so is 80% of the shame and guilt. It'll take me awhile to not feel awkward too.  I guess things are looking up.   **
