Seriously though, he needs some excitement in his life.  I'm really happy that school is ending soon. Everyone says it, but only a few people really believe it. But anyway, I'm trying to get other people to join this, so maybe a few people will post on this each day. I'm not exactly sure how it works yet.  A lot of people think I am a jerk, but I bet I am secretly a nice guy.
