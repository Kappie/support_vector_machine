Ahh... just came back from a party at Eric's house. And no, I didn't go there of my own free will... eric's family are family friends ^^ so the entire family was there. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the evening.. I did ^^;; There were a bunch of people there that I didn't know... in fact, the only kid i knew there was Eric =P   We played some Marvel vs Capcom (ahh... the old days of PS), some CS (counterstrike - in which i suck at), and duelled a bit (duel monsters!)   Well, hopefully everyone has phunn!! (Addicted to *phunn* ever since i saw 'fisiks is phunn' at OCS... that phrase made me laugh =P)   ~Chronos
