Right now I'm working on this DVD program for my dad, and it's not working, ugh *growls to self*.  Anyways, I'm had a good time going to eat ice cream with Jeremiah and his little sister Rachael when this cop comes up.  Apparently there was some poor guy sleeping on a bench.  I don't think the guy was from around here, but he was supposedly waiting at a bus stop to go downtown.  I think he must have just fallen asleep, but someone called the police on him.  Apparently your not supposed to sleep on public benches (what's up with that?  We pay for them; can't we sleep on them?)  So the officer made the guy get up.  He walked off and I didn't see him again, but I sure did feel sorry for him.  I'm having/I had a nice talk with Colleen just being goofy, but I think I may have made Steph mad or sad by telling her something I knew about someone else.  Idk, I hope she's ok.
