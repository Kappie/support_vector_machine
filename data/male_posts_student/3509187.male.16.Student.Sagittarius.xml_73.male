Crazy Man Johnny is FUNNY! And I had forgotten about most of my groups... funny thing is I was the only one in the group who had seen the whole thing until today.    And after School Chad drove me home! Whoo... I got home like 20 minutes earlier than usual... it was nice... Can't wait til I can drive.  I called Goodwill to see if my aplication would be considered again now that they are hiring again... I hope I get the job cause it would be so nice to work right there by school, and I've heard its a pretty easy job... I'd be pretty with most any job right about now... I need some money. Well thats about it.... Have a great weekend and Good Luck if you are taking the SATs tomorrow...  -Dan V
