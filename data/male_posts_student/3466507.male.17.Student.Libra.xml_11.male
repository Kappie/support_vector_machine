One of my pet hates are flies... just can't get enough of killing them. They are less of a problem here at the hostel as compared to my house. One of the problems I really face here are the ants. It seems as if they are everywhere... sigh....  One would think that there are no mosquitoes on the 8th floor. Unfortunately, one somehow managed to get into my housemates room. When I went there for a visit, I was stung by it... I get stung by mosquitoes whenever I go to the side of the pool too. I occasionally go there to chill out at night(sorry to all the couples dating there!).  That's all I have to crap about for now. I am waiting for Rajiv's blog about the taekwondo tournament he entered today. Maybe he can't post for sometime because he broke a hand or somehing like that (muahaha I'm evil). Just kidding. I hope he's fine.
