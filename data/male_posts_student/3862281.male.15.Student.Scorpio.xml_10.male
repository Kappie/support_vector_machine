Endless Hell  by George Clarke   slowly into his arms  all fears gone  all wishes said  he embraces you  takes you forward  on and on you tread   go to the next  moving onward  he smiles so friendly  gates are in sight  gestured through  welcomed so gently   a liar you see  you now know  destroyed your trust  nowhere now  you look around  you walk on as you must   no turning back  no going back  the doors now closed tight  no surrender  no mercy  all you havenow is tofight   you regret  try to forget  as you walk out from the door  you fear  don't wish  as you enter the eternal war     Just a quick explanation on that poem, a lot of the thinking of my beliefs are very complicated and I won't go into them in one post alone but few things to help understand the poem - I believe that when you die you're greeted by death, I don't try to give death a form he is merely something that greets you, he greets you friendly explains you're dead and leads you to the afterlife, he shows you the doors and tells you to walk through and when you do they close behind you, you look out onto the worlds of Hell, the last destination of everybody, whether they've been good or bad, everyone goes to Hell, you're soul is torn and warped by the lands of Hell and you become a warrior, created and designed purely to fight, a being of evil, you enter the war of souls, every person in every universe who has died comes here and they are forced to fight, thoughts flood your mind and your body betrays you as it runs into the fray, you die again in seconds, you appear outside of the gate again staring out at Hell again, you notice the other souls leaving the gates that litter the land, endless floods of crazed demons rushing into war, you follow, you have no choice, you fight for eternity.   I won't go into why or how I came to believe this, like I said my beliefs have very complex elements in them and would take a lot of explaining to understand.   Anyone who feels suicidal and is reading this, see this as my argument for why you should live, unless you fully believe the next life is better than the one you currently live you should avoid death at all costs. There is nothing to say what happens in the afterlife, you cannot be assured that it'll be heaven that waits for you, perhaps an endless war or a place of torture awaits instead.    Think about the consequences of your actions.    Me and Alyssa shared the same beliefs, that is why I cry for her. But one day I know that we will fight together and we will be stronger next time. She knows to delay death until I'm by her side again, and then we will fight him. We put a challenge towards god for letting Hell happen, ifit denys us then we shall lead others against it. She died because of these beliefs and I won't let her death be in vain.
