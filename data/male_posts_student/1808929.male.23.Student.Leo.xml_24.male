At 11 a.m. I said my goodbyes to Shaomeng and headed to the Armadillo Grill where I meet with Dahl Clark one last time. She is looking forward to her future in physics research and starting her own lab equipment business. When she was talking with me I remember at one time she commented on how I seemed to have lots of friends. I was really baffled by this, for I don’t think of myself this way at all. It’s all in the eye of the beholder. Her comment gets me thinking quite a bit. Will I ever just be happy with the way I am? 	Less than two hours before I was scheduled to leave campus I met with Jen Farrell at the Loop. She immediately expresses her disapproval of my facial hair. I tell her that she’s not alone, for just about every girl I meet has said the same thing. Jen is doing well and has recently returned from a WHO conference in South Africa. She and I share a common interest in public health and health policy, though she is more interested in international health issues while I am more drawn to regional Texas health issues. Children’s health and development is important to her, while insurance coverage and obesity are my big issues. Finally we talked about her forced resignation from the squad back in the fall. I still can’t believe that things happened to her the way they did. It’s incredibly unfortunate. She has a visceral dislike for Steve and the others involved with squad leadership. She said at one point that she felt like she was crying out for help so many times only to find that no one was listening. I can’t imagine her anger, though now it’s turned into a quiet frustration. I tried to let her know that she is tied in with the photographs and memories of so many people already graduated and we all think of Jen and DUEMS completely different from the way that she or Steve sees her involvement with DUEMS. She seemed to appreciate that sentiment. Seriously, before this year she was on the squad for 3 years. She and I joined the squad at the same time, yet our finale experiences couldn’t have been different! Jen is going places though. She’s going to be a serious asset to public health wherever she is and I hope to keep in touch with her over the years.  	I talked with Jen for nearly two hours and realized I had 10 minutes to buy my friend a t-shirt, get money from the ATM, and then get my luggage and meet Steve at the bus stop? Was it possible? Could Doug do it all in time? Well, not really, I was about five minutes late getting to the bus stop, but mainly because I ran into Lexie Riofrio and Matt McDaniel in the Bryan Center and Brandon Jones while in the EMS office. I wish I had longer to talk to all those people, but alas, no. As I was getting ready to leave, I heard a call go out! It was the first one I’d heard all week. Some person was disoriented after having been stuck in an elevator. It was a thrill just listening to the tones and dispatch once again.  	Steve volunteered to take me to the airport and we had a nice chat on the way over. Steve’s a very quiet guy, so he didn’t say much. We said our goodbyes at terminal C and I headed on my way. The best part of my vacation was over. It was time for me to leave and return to Texas. I was kinda sad at that moment. I mean, I really enjoyed being a Dukie once again. It was a strange combination of being welcome, yet out-of-place at the same time. On the plane I had to deal with this sadness and loneliness all over again. It was really the same feeling I felt on my graduation day a year ago. The plane started higher and higher until it finally broke through the rainy clouds. For the first time all week I saw blue, sunny skies stretching everyway. It was beautiful. This is corny, I know, but I believe that everything happens for a reason. At that time on the plane I thought about how lucky I was to have an opportunity to see so many college friends once again. How lucky am I also that I will probably keep touch with a few of them for quite a number of years?  	I’m now back home in Northern Texas and I wonder how I can bring that college passion to my life in Fort Worth. The city is great, there are nice people here and plenty of opportunities, but something keeps me closed in, detached from my world. What kind of bullshit is going on in my head? People are getting killed every day in Afghanistan and Iraq, 43 million people in this country are without health insurance, and millions of hypocrits in this country want to deny equal rights to gay individuals just because of religious fanaticism and/or bigotry. There is no excuse for my apathy. Unless I want to end up like Dostoevsky’s Underground Man, I have got to push myself beyond my comfort zone. It’s time for me to move on.
