I wanted the comments and title provided by a common template and not found on the blogskin with Aragorn in all his kingly splendor. The background will change when the times deem it necessary.  The fiery eyes and burning tongue, the cold retort, the bloody feud and warfare, and, in the end, the judgmental decree. Goodness, I enjoyed my first debate of the season. I'd say  we won, but there truly was no "judgemental decree" as it was only a "practice debate". Still, I say we won. It feels good to straight impact turn and weigh the round once more. I had a momentous adrenalin rush while preparing for the neg arguments (disclosure is required upon pain of...something truely nasty yet unmentioned), and that pulled through till the 2AR. Can't wait to go Negative. A slight downer to the debate was Emily and my inround symbiosus was strained and frayed. I will mark it down to first time partnering and hope for greater streamlining as the year progresses.   We've already decided on the 'mark' for our evidence and tub. It was a misformation of the letter "f' which looks quite like an explosive stick with wick and keg. I will try to replicate it more fully to inscribe it upon our storages and usables.
