So, I thought I'd follow Sir Radish's grand example, and post them. Well, here they are:           I would rather be in company with a dead man than an absent one. For, if the dead man gives me no pleasure, at least he shows me no contempt, whereas the absent man, silently indeed, but very plainly, tell me that he does not think me worth his attention.   - Lord Chesterfield           We should ever conduct ourselves towards our enemy as if he were one day to be our friend.                                                                                                           -John Henry   Newman            Help thy brother's boat across, and lo! Thine own boat has reached the shore.   -Hindu Proverb            I have no right, by anything I do or say, to demean a human being in his own eyes. What matters is not hwat I think of him, it is what he thinks of himself. To undermine a man's self esteem is a sin.   -Antoine de Saint-Exupery            A ship in the harbor is safe, but that's not what ships were built for.   -John A. Shield            If you chase two rabbits, both will escape.   -Unknown            I know no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor.   -Henry David Thoreau            Come, my friends, 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.   -Alfred Lord Tennyson           Well, I hope I didn't bore you too much. Remember, it was your choice, not mine to read them, if you did lol. Well, cya'all later!
