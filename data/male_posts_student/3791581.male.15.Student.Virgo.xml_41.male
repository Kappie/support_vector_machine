I can't help but admire the manicured lawns and gardens nestled among the modern office towers.  Its like a green oasis in what would otherwise be a concrete world.   I've only been here for almost two weeks and already I'm beginning to really like it here.  I like the new and progressive vibe here.  Midtown Atlanta has great restaurants, museums, shopping and the famous Piedmont Park and Atlanta Botanical Gardens which we intend on visiting next week.  Nearby Buckhead has upscale shopping, luxury condos, trendy restaurants and more beautiful corporate complexes.   Temps have come down to a comfortable high-80s without humidity which is a nice change.  I hear the winters are very mild too.  Apparently most people put up their Christmas lights in shorts.  I can't say that I'd be offended if I never ever saw snow again.  Hee!  My girlfriend Jane who has just relocated back to her home state of New Jersey from the SF Bay Area is planning a road trip here with her family and brother next week.  They want to see everything that I've been raving about.   I'll be sure to put the digital to hard use so you can see what I'm talking about here in the ATL.
