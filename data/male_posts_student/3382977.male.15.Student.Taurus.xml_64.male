Its so far my favorite cathedral (i didnt get to see the inside of the Notre Dam so i cant say thats better, even if it might be). There are five organs inside, one above the main entrance where there is usually an organ, and four around the corners of the cross section in the front. It is also magnificantly decorated and is just amazing!
