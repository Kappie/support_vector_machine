If I have a big day, I will put in a extra one, but otherwise, forget it, It's too much work.  Last week was fun, First July 4th came, The fireworks were cool as usual. My mom and dad had there friends from indiana come. They have an 8 year old with an unbelieveable amount of energy. He kind of got annoying at times, but he's a cool kid and I dealt with it. We went boating the Saturday, and i went tubing(now that I look back, I would have much rather fished). My back was sore after that, wow.  On Monday, we had a day off from softball, and holy crap did we need it. I felt great. No losing today, but we get to play again tommorow and get crapped on. Well, if there's any team to beat, it this team I guess. I'm ready, problem is, who else on my team will be... Getting back to the week, The Brewers defeated the Cubs(YEA BABY!) 1-0 on a craig counsell home-run. The Cub fans at my house were disapointed, and made the excuse ben sheets was on the mound, and they would lose the rest of the games in the series. Tuesday, I accomplished what felt like nothing at work, I was just too excited for the brewers when I got home, and the REAL GAME on Wednesday. The Brewers Won Again, With Victor Santos on the mound 4-2. It was great. I couldn't wait for wednesday. We headed out at 2 to the game and got there around 5:30. We tailgated with subs(not a real tailgate, but good enough). I felt alone, there were 70% cubs fans their. I was ready for the sweep though. The Lowly Number Of Brewer fans that were there held up brooms in honor of in there minds an inevidible sweep. Well, I was hoping they'd win, but I didn't know. Our seats were awesome, above the foul pole, HAHAHAHA wow. It was ok though, what a rush. 43,000 others were around me. Doug Davis was on the mound for the brewers, and ended the inning quickly in the 1st. The brewers didnt do much either. In fact the game didn't get good till the 3rd. Lyle Overbay singled, and then ginter knocked him to second, and then wes helms brought him in making the game 1-0. Davis continued to be strong. in the 4th or 5th I don't remember, Craig Counsell singled, and then Geoff Jenkins came to the plate. he hit the ball higher than the stadium and then it seemed like it was going to be caught easily by sosa in Right Field. I couldn't see it from where we were standing, but then the Crowd erupted into a frenzy, i thought a good catch had been made by Sosa, but it was the brewers fans cheering, and bernie took the dive down the slide. A homerun, It was looking good! The brewers added one more run later, and Davis threw an 8 inning shutout, handing the ball to mike adams, a reliever, not Dan Kolb the closer, to end the 4-0 game. The Brewer Fans Stood up and chanted sweep as the ball went over the bat of the Cubs batter for strike three to end the game. What a game! I loved it. Our Friendly Cubbie fan that we brought along thought it as the most boring game he's seen. Me and My bro were lovin' it. As we made the trip home, I realized one thing, I had to work tommorow. Thursday, I worked in the truck for the first time in awhile. My work day sucked again. Friday, Same old $#!+ different day. At least I got to see king arthur and have some breakfast at denny's that friday night. Grand Slam Breakfast's for Dinner are freakin' good. Saturday, Sheets pitched his butt off and the brewers won again. Sunday, the brewers choked to end there pre all-star break record 4 games above .500 It's been a great season! Hopefully it will continue. I get payed tommorow, YES! I'll get ya the softball update tommorow. Also Sunday, I found a camera tape of some footage back in 8th grade that I have, SCARY! I was weird back then, I taped girls. I couldn't believe myself. I'm glad I don't do that dumb stuff anymore. It was a good memory though to look back on. 4 girls, 2 ugly, 2 hot. Too bad I haven't hung out with them since the beginning of my sophmore year. Maybe someday I will again, doubtful, but just maybe. One of em' I saw at best buy, but didn't realize it till I was out the door, I wanted to go back in and say hi, but... nevermind. I need to get some f***in' balls dammit. Cya everyone, Lata, J.
