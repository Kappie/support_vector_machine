Reagan said this during his first Presidential campaign. Of course, he sunk the economy even lower during his quest to conquer the Soviets, but hey, he  did  bring the Ruskies to their knees, didn't he? I guess I shouldn't be taking shots at the Gipper now that he is dead instead of merely senile.   Rest in Peace, Ronnie.  Some new things on the blog today: You can now put links on the sidebar. E-mail me the links you would like under your name or just post them here. I'm fiddling with the template and I think I might switch the template again. Oh, and you can have titles now.  Today was a boring waste of time. In short, a perfect summer day. John bailed on me and Chris when we went to go mini-golfing, so we didn't go. I must've called 30 people to try and get someone to go with us, but nobody was home. Erik is a mess because some of Gail's friends are visiting, with daughters, and Erik's "hormones are ragin'," to quote Gail. He's being a bigger asshole than normal, if that is even possible. We went swimming in South Long last night and this morning and it was freaking  cold .  Tomorrow is going to be busy, what with the Goat match and all. It is going to be a pain to get everyone together, but if everyone babysits one other person of the irresponsible half of our team, it should be cool. I've got pledges from John, Houley, the Oselands, and Bryce that they will be there. Hobe will come too, and I hope David also. The Oselands have this super-weapon they call Kramer who is really good at Halo and said he would come too. But I would rather take people who are fighting for honor rather than personal glory. We should meet somewhere tomorrow a few hours before the Goat match.  I hope my UPS stuff comes tomorrow.   Like I said earlier, if you can find people that wish to join, then by all means, do so. Some diversity would be cool.   I agree with Houley. Even though I don't think that the poem is about a girl, I bet that is why Hawkeye is so down all the time. (You know what that poem reminded me of? Wheel of Time.) The Man is always sticking it to him. I bet he has a bad case of the emos because Sarah E. doesn't like him or something like that.   Kids worry about their relationships with the opposite sex too much. It is supposed to be something natural, not something you force. So don't worry about it, man. And if you think we are making fun of you or something, just let me quote some U.S. Bombs:  "All my friends, they get their kicks stomping on my dreams."  When we're done stomping, you'll feel better.   I don't particularly enjoy Sci-Fi, but I've still read some good Sci-Fi and tons of garbage.  Ender's Game  is a great read. Off the subject of sci-fi, a few good books off the top of my head that you should read are the  Dark Towers, Cat's Cradle, American Gods, Catch-22, and Catcher in the Rye  can be read in a couple hours if you have the time and is quite good. I'll bring  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest  to Goatfest.  I really hate it when I try to get a hold of Hobe and he doesn't answer his home phone or bring his cell phone with him. He  never  has his cell phone.  I'm  supposed to be the unreliable one, damnit, and it really annoys me.  I'll hand out some awards, too. But mine will be longer. I'll probably post how Goatfest goes tomorrow night, and maybe I will then.   I feel about done for tonight.  Uh, I'm not really ready to quit, though.  John, you annoy the hell out of me. Even worse than Chris, you give me a headache. Quit ditching us at the last second because all of us really hate it.  I doubt I'll sleep for another four hours (It's 11:20 now) and I wish someone would post later than me. Anyway, Gute Nacht.
