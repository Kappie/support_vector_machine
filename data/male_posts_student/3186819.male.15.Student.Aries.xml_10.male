You know, It must of taken truck fulls of courage to ask you out and you "dump-him" before you've even gone out? What the h*ll? If you don't want to go out with someone don't but don't pretend you do and then change your mind. All and all i've talked to Robert about what a girlfriend is (or boyfriend really) at our age. Clearly to any regular person in gr. 9 sex is not an issue so I'll leave that out of this. (I thought I'd acknowledge it to show that I'm aware and that I simply don't wish to bring that into things) General requirements for signifigant others: attractive *whatever that might be to you*, clearly likes you *so as to attempt to avoid rejection*, funny, potentially smart, has common ground with you, is able to keep up a conversation without awkward pauses. How many of these was Julie? right, none. But moving on in Rob and my discussion we brought up the fact that those things were pretty much how you define a best friend. It's true! This hole obsession with boyfriends and girlfriends is stupid because ultimately you're looking for a best friend, which many of us already have. Why do we pressure ourselves into giving these ppl who we care about titles? Maybe I'm missing something but If your requirements for a girlfriend or whatever are there already matched to someone, why ruin that by pressuring them into something they don't want to do? Leave it at that. When it happens it happens right? And then you can reevaluate what a girlfriend is.  Best of luck to you Julie, I'm sure guys love trying to go out with the girl who doesn't even give ppl a chance. "Let's just be friends?" right, that'd be a step up for you Hun,
