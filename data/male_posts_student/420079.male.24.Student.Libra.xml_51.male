You see, I don't want to admit it because that would mean I'm not the rabid conservative I've always pretended to be.  But we all knew that already, didn't we? My "conservatism" springs more from common sense than from any particular ideology... and yet I have embraced the conservative cause, which so often corresponds with the Republican cause.  I'm not sure I want to do that anymore. I am beginning to have serious misgivings about our foreign policy, about the war in Iraq, about our place in the world. I watched Bill Clinton's speech on CSpan yesterday, from the Dean fundraiser out in the fields of Iowa, and I found myself agreeing with him more than I disagreed.  I still disagreed  -- just not as much as I used to. When I saw that most of the things he said made a lot of sense, I cringed despite myself. But I knew a shift was taking place.  I am still a conservative, and still a Republican. But only moderately... and if I ever ran for office, I could probably run as a conservative Democrat. I don't know. This is all very confusing.  I recorded my raw thoughts into a voice recorder the other day, and I urge you to  urlLink listen to the file.  It's about seven minutes, and I sure would like some guidance.
