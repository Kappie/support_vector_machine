Her looks need not be too good if not guys will be going gaga over her and when will I get my chance. Haiz... Who asked my mum to be bias and gave birth to near prefect sisters and an ugly me. Nvm~ I will be a beautiful Swan in time to come! I scare cannot transform properly then I became half half. CHEESEEEEEE... What about her character? Cheerful, nice, sociable, no temper, not too clumsy, always putting on a big smile, and most importantly open minded!( Don't think slant slant hor)  Do I still like her? That is questions that have been troubling me for months and for years. Do I like her because I like her for who she is or izzit because I am so use to the feeling of liking and to the extent that it actually becomes a habit. Anyway, she is attached now and I can’t be bother. It will be half a decade now if I still have feelings for her but hopefully not for there is a time to let go of something that is not within your reach. I am just digging a deeper grave for myself. Maybe Yeo is right, it is time for me to let go~  I have a difficult time trying to pronounce one of my classmate's names, Genevieve. What a weird name! I kept pronouncing it wrongly and there is she Jed is Gen-ev-ieve. (-.-") I just don't like that name! =P She better not see this. If not I will be >.  Had a class outing just now in the afternoon at pavilion K-pool. I didn't expect so many of my classmates actually knows how to play pool! I tot they were those who spend 3/4 of the youth studying and the other 1/4 sleeping, eating and bathing.   I met Zhi Cheng and Kenny along with their MJC's teacher? Man she look like a student to me! Serene and Limin meet me later as well to play pool and I think I lose to Limin quite a number of times. Moew! I need to brush up on my skills! Gen is the tyco queen of the lot esp. when I am playing 9-balls with her. (-.-") I lost to her even single match I think. I want a rematch! That clumsy sassy girl actually broke the ceiling because she is just so excited when she wins me. Stupid pig!     Guess what I had only an hour of lesson today. Lalalala
