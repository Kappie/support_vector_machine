The last two weeks have been hella crazy and things are starting to fall into place.  I'll try and summarize as quickly as possible...  On Sunday, April 25, 2004 my Dad had a massive heart attack and lost conciousness and never regained it.  I am his only child (adopted at birth at that), my parents are divorced, my Grandma (his mom)has dementia, and his two siblings (one brother and one sister) left the decisions up to me.  Since it is estimated he went without oxygen to his brain approximately ten minutes, there was not much hope.  I waited a week to see if he would come to, but he didn't.  Finally, on Sunday, May 2, 2004, exactly one week later, I had the doctors remove life support from my Dad.  I was there at his side when it was removed and waited for quite some time.  He lived six hours without life support and no family or friends were at his side when he passed away.  This process was one of the most complicated ones I've gone through at this point.  I am blessed to have so many friends and family members that love, support, and look out for me.  My Dad had no money or property so the cremation was a cost to me.  Dad's side of the family is helping me as much as they can to get through this on the financial aspect.  There is no service and his ashes will be taken to a place I know he wants them scattered in the mountains.  I remember from a young age him saying he wanted his ashes placed in Thunder Creek in the Cascades.  That is one decision I didn't have to make and I'm glad I wasn't left to decide whether or not to cremate.  There are a lot of other crazy twists and turns in my Dad's life that I found out when I went to his residence.  I will not go into it too much, but there was an attempt to murder him a week before his heart attack, arrested on warrant (driving on suspended license) when giving his statement to the police about the attempt, not given his medication while in jail, and so on and so on...My Dad's life was far from normal so I don't know why I expected his death and post death to be any different.  I just thank God that I'm adopted!  On top of everything else, and trying to get caught up on school an regain control of my own life, I have to move out of my current residence due to circumstances beyond my control.  I don't know where I am going yet, but I probably will put things in storage and crash on a friend's couch for a while until I figure it out.  Financial Aid for school was denied even though I made less than poverty last year.  Because I'm a single, white, male, there is little financial support available to me at this point.  I'm appealing to see if they can look at current finances, but I'm not optimistic.  Sorry to be so long winded, but I'm sure some of this will be referenced in the future; I wanted to give a little background to lessen the confusion if at all possible.  Take care and have a great week!
