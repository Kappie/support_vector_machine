    
       Arg. I really dislike using other people's templates when I can make a perfectly fine  urlLink Blogger  template myself. So now I am using  urlLink Dan Cederholm  template- he also has some good reads.    Planning on getting my own template made by next month, but with all the things going on it just keeps getting harder and harder to get things done around this materialized thing called "life".
