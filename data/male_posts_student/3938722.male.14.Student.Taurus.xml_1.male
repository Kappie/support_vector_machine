Day 1: Got into our hotel and ate at an indian place    Day 2: Walked around the peir for like the whole day, in the process pretty much turning my legs to very soft jelly, saw the Punisher    Day 3: Woke up at like 6 to rush to Karate at like 3, but my dad's car did NOT sprout wings and fly (faster than 60 miles an hour grr) so we got there like 15 minutes late...    Anyhoo, after i went to Devin's bday party, which was fun...watched Scary Movie 3 and Jeepers Creepers 2.   REVIEWS!!!   The Punisher:four words - random acts of violence...it follows the plot of the actual comic (i think) but its fun to watch...plenty of bloodshed. BEE!   Scary Movie 3: freaking hilarious.   Jeepers Creepers 2: Stupid slasher movie. Average noodles dudes, average.   ANYHOOi hope you all had a fun time...i really need to get some sleep now.
