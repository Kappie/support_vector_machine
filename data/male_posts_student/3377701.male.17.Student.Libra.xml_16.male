We all took our jabs today though i needed to wait a FREAKIN HOUR for it. Man the doctor took like wat , 10 min per person !??? Grrr!!! And it onli took him 2 sec to jab the freakin thing!!! ( didn't feel a thing ) Anyways dinner wasn't much better either. Me and my stupid bright ideas. Tried to copy Daniel's mom's tuna pasta. Failed terribly.... nearly ate raw potato if not for my friend who was coincidentally around ( potato cant be eaten raw ? LOL ) Tasted like dog food , is was so wet and yucky. Next time i better get the proper recipe before experimenting again.... BLeh!  Still rethinking about the blog layout changing thingy , since Jolene kindly offered her assistance to me =P
