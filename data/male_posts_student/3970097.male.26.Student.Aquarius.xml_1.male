Yes.!! after that incident, we are still good friends. We talk, we discuss things, we share whenever we need things to be but there are jut so many complications or should I say misunderstandings, which are making me unsure with each passing day. Not that I need a sympathy or something, its just..............I couldnt keep this any longerdeep in my heart. I msut confess something here, i cried the first day when i realized that I might lose her if i dont let her know about my feelings for her. Its really embarressing for a guy actualy to cry, bcoz we are not suppose to cry out our worries or things that bother usbut we are also human beings, with a beating heart. I remember that day was a terrible one, i docked off at Claisebrook station, took a walk towards my homewhile she was in my mind. Im sorry i cant complete it at this time but I will come back with a second part of this pretty soon. Hopefully with lots more concentration. Thanks for being with me.
