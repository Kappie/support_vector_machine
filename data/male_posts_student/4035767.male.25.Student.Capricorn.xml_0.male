One goal of his project is figuring out whether  urlLink copyrights , the regime of intellectual property rights that Professor Cotter argued in a recent article in the  urlLink Florida Law Review  can be viewed as " urlLink memetic engineering ," stifles creativity by conferring broad rights on owners to control the uses of their works.  In other words, will this particular property rights regime lead to a lack of memetic diversity?    The idea is that memetic engineering is analogous to  urlLink centralized genetic engineering schemes , and as such comes with all the risks of such schemes.  Since  urlLink social engineers cannot foresee all the consequences of their actions  any more than genetic engineers, cannot be trusted to be virtuous, and do not have access to the information found in a disperse market, there are potentially catastrophic results, including memetic homogeneity.    So the question is, ultimately, how important is unpredictability in the creative process?  Since copyrights require negotiation and planning in advance, does that system stifle creativity?  Does copyright law preclude serendipity?  Is chance even necessary for creativity?  So if there are any  urlLink cognitive scientists ,  urlLink evolutionary psychologists ,  urlLink copyright lawyers ,  urlLink Hayek scholars , or any other interested parties, feel free to comment at will...
