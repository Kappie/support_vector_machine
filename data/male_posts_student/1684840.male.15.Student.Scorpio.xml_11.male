The other guys were packing up stuff into the trolly while I was watching this cool robotic hoover lol  We then went to this MASSIVE mall where we went to get my mum's engagement ring resized, then we all went looking around these stores.  After that we went to this really cheap elecrtical goods store, yet again MASSIVE!  I had another bottle of Mountain Dew and we made our way to Mc Donald's, one of the few hundred to choose from LOL  I had yet another MASSIVE drink of Dr Pepper and I'm full of caffeine and shaking like mad *shakes*  We then went to H.E.B. again where I bought Natalie's Jello and loads of Kool-Aid!  I've added more pictures to the 'Pictures One' gallery page, so check them out now!!  Might post later on, cya :)  P.S, Look down!  I have now added a Mood tag :)  Now you will know how I'm feeling!  I'll update it every post, but it will change on all of the posts, so don't get confused now :)
