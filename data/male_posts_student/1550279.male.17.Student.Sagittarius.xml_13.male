GPRS and EDGE have allowed people to get on the internet anywhere that they can get a digital cellphone connection. Take the availability of cellphone networks, replace the necessity for a cellphone with a wireless card (much like 802.11a/b/g), and up the speed to almost twice that of a T3 connection:   that's  802.16 .  This isn't the only new technology that's competing to be the next thing home users will use for their internet connection, but with speeds and convenience on this level, whatever technology end up becoming widely adopted will take the internet to a whole new level.
