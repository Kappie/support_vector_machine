Hidalgo wasn't though, which is a good thing.  I liked it, the only part I didn't like was the shooting at wounded knee.  Killing people in war is one thing, but killing helpless people is a massacre. That is defenintly wrong.  Hidalgo was good, but the Last Samurai is better.  They're not really in the same genre, so I can't effectively compare them.  Out of the two I liked the Last Samurai better. Maybe it's because it is a war movie.  I always liked those..go figure.  One thing that seriously annoys me is that great lack of tactics and strategy from the Samurai at the last battle. If they had   just  used a slight bit of tactics, they could have inflicted alot more damage, and sustained alot less casualties.  If they had positioned archers on either side of that small road the soldiers had to come down, they could have inflicted ALOT more casualties.  If they had used those pitch package deals, they could have burned more men, and if they hadn't LINED UP TO BE SHOT BY THE HOWITZERS they wouldn't have been hurt so bad in the first place. Hello?! Let's line up for the howitzers shall we?  I know they needed to stage a retreat and all, but stick a smaller force in there. Anyways, that's how that goes with me.  Time to go pick up some much needed supplies. Chaio!
