I have this one friend, and it never fails that if I'm in a bad mood and I talk to them, I usually end up feeling better or at least my mood has lightened a little bit, and the opposite is true.  When this friend is sad or depressed, I experience it, too. Not quite to the same degree or level they are, but I shift a little bit.  Maybe it's something like sympathy pains or that sort.  Or maybe it's just because I care so much about this person and have so much invested that I really feel what they're going through.  My friend is the greatest.  I sometimes want to be selfish and keep this person to myself, but that's not right.  I hope everyone in some way or another has a friend like mine.  Here's to you, friend!
