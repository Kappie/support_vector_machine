Later on, I played more Golden Sun. I'm still trying to get all the djinn so I can get to the secret level in the second game.  Anyways, that was boring: djinn hunting. I got stuck in a cave. How much boredom can you get.  I then flipped the game off and turned on the TV. Nothing was on except news. News is boring.  Next thing I went to work. Not as boring. At least I'm doing something. The three hours I worked today went by smoothly.  Somehow there's a big scratch or something on my forearm. I'd tell you what it was if I knew, and it doesn't look like it's going away soon. It looks like one giant scar. I have no idea what that was caused by. As soon as I find the  source  of this I'll tell you.    Next sequence of events, I went home, played more Golden Sun, trying to complete the cavern level this time, and didn't succeed. I put the game down. Maybe tomorrow.  I flipped on the TV again. Might as well watch the news. I stopped that and went upstairs to my room to play on the computer, update some cage scores, check my  urlLink gameboards  messages, and screw around editing graphics for a while. I'm actually getting pretty good at that.  What my parents' problem is that they can't tell me things unless it's short-notice. I stood up until 12:00 midnight and then my parents came in and said I had to wake up at 6:00am. What the heck?!  I guess now it's inevitable: I'll only have 6 hours of sleep tonight. Minus the hours I can't sleep.
