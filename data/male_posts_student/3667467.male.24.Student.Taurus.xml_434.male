But one last time with the 4th grade papers.  Maybe, if you're nice, you can see more in the future.  Fourth grade was not very fun.  I didn't like the teachers and creative writing was a chore.  Note how I really pad out the story, also, the future irony of my sports prediction.   Jan. 26, 1990  Motor Bowl  The year is 2223 football, baseball, and basketball have stopped being America's favorite pastimes.  The new craze: motor ball.  The game is played almost like football.  It is played with 10 people on each team, all riding motorcycles.  The object of the game: to an old football in your motorcycle across an old football field to the end zone.  (This game is very dangerous)...  Hello, motorsports fans, Im Derf Kcorhcs This is the 4th annual Motor Bowl.  The teams: Buffalo Brakes against the San Francisco 49 horsepower.  Buffalo's fixing their Yamahas, While San Francisco check out their Harleys.  And the game is about to begin.  1st quarter.  The 49'ers got a little bit too tense.  Their quarterback just about GAVE the ball to Buffalo.  It was the Break's ball anyway.  2nd quarter.  Buffalo made one, but missed the extra point.  The 49'ers lost their quarterback due to a motorcycle injury.  Now they're mad...  3rd quarter.  San Francisco made two touchdowns.  (for the other team)  Score: Buffalo 26, San Francisco 0.  4th quarter.  The 49'ers make two touchdowns, two extra points.  Now they make another touchdown, but missed the extra point.  26 to 26.  10 seconds left.  9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Wait!  The Breaks made a touchdown they win.  By the way, Buffalo has won all 4 Motor Bowls.
