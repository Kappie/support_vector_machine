Lunch at subway was fun.. the i got back and researched plant life in trona, ca. i've got a list of over 1,000 plants.. wow.. uh... and hopefully it'll be nice enough to play volleyball in a few minutes.. so.. good stuff. i could use some coffee right about now.  oh, yeah, and some guys from the DC showed up today .. so.. yeah..
