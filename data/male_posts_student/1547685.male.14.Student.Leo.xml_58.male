I wish that the pay was a little more but its good experience for my future in whatever i do. SO after that i went to Fremont with my mom and bro to check out this Best SAT class for my bro to take. I also saw Kenny there so i gave him a quick wave from the other room. After, we ate lunch and then got a pearl drink from this one store but the one thing was.....none of them spoke english. So we stood there for like 20 minutes telling them what we ordered and what goes with what. SO finally after that long period of wasted life, i went to Frys and looked around for a while. Then we went to Ryan's house to help him with his computer problems and stuff like that. I had no clue what was going on so i sat there for an hour looking at the CCS year book. I did see some fimiliar faces in there and while i was looking through i wondered.....why cant our year book ever be this good? A while later i went home and watched the rest of the Home Run Derby. No, Barry Bondes did not win but he did have the most homeruns in the first round then anybody else. So after that i ate dinner and then did my chores. My bros taking his sr. pics tomorrow so i pray he takes a half decent one for his own sake. jkjkjk im out!
