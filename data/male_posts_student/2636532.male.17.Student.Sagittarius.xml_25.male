Wow! it's been such a long time since i last blogged it's not even funny anymore. you know what i blame, society. isn't that convieniant? if any thing goes wrong you can blame society. Some crazy chick beats her kids to death with a shovel and is arrested and put on trial, she says that she was beaten as a child and abbused by society and she's praised as a hero for coming through it. or some guy goes postal and he blames it on the fact that he was picked on when he was in elementary school. All this bullshit about everythingbeing society's fault has gotta just damn well piss off alot of you. People can make choices, something that happened all that long time ago shouldn't influence your actions let alone be the cause of them, meaning that you can't be put in jail for stabbing 10 people to death with an ice pick because your brother flicked toothpicks at them when you were a baby. Another thing that pisses me off is how cheap people are when it cames to remembrance day. come on people, these veterans faught for your country's freedom and all you can give for a poppy is a pathetic 5 cents??? dig deep you cheap bastards! atleast give a dollar, or 5 because we owe them our very lives. and go to a freaking remembrance day ceremony, november 11th isn't just a day off so you can sleep in, it's the day we honor those who died fighting for this great land of ours called Canada.  -Matt
