The latest problem of mine: Juan doesn't want to hang out with me anymore because I am too "depressing". Well, fuck him, I am not depressing. Oh sure, I am a little low b/c of this whole Laura situation but that is about it. And who is he to say who is depressing? But whatever, I really don't care. Like Vic suggested, I'm just going to carry on with my life. Oh yeah, I emailed my sister last night about the USMC, and I basically shocked her. She called here at 8:00 am just to talk to me about it. And all she really said were the obvious things. Like the fact that I have to go to college, that USMC is the hardest branch to get into, and all that good stuff. But carrying on, my eye is fucking bothering me all to hell. Even these prescription eye drops don’t help, but oh well. I’ll live, lol. Yesterday I got my package from Jojo; complete with pics and 5 blank cds, 4 of which I could do w/e I want lol. But yeah, I still haven’t gotten a hold of Laura yet. Bummer/10 but there is nothing I can really do about it I might just end up emailing her about what’s been going through my mind, which most of you know by now. Subject change (I am just bouncing all around). Monday me and The Joo are going to Wet n Wild. It plans to be fun. But lately whenever I have a plan it always fucks up. Also, TwiztedKlown from CDT is going to be emailing me Behind the Paint, and in return I am going to burn him a copy of bmh. A fair trade in my eyes (even if one is fucked up). But yeah, a lot of drama going on, and I’m out.
