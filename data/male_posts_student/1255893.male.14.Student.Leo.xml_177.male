The whole post was basically ranting bout stereotypical bloggers. for example: the gurls who always have a terrible day, people who post "ugly" pictures of themeselves, people who type about their day. You know, what most of us do. Some lame ass attempt at showing her superiority.  Then to cap it off with saying she's joking. I dont know to believe that or not. However, y not say that IN THE POST! instead of waiting for someone to shut em up.... i mean..... if they ARE just joking.   enough of that. Todays been pretty awesome. 'cept enetation is down, so if someoen wants to post comments they can go to my guestbook. Oh, and while Im on the subject of comments... Please be aware that you only have to click the comment button ONCE after you finish your post. people impatiently click it a lot when the new post may not show until you refresh the window. This caused 14 comments to show in my last post, when it couldve just been about 5. Not that Im mad at all, I enjoy that people are commenting so keep it comin.   lemme get back to my original subject. Today was kewl. Didnt really do much at school. Jus hung out w/ friends mostly.
