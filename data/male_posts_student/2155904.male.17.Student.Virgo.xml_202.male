And that is wonderful.  But Tyke still did have to go through today before getting there.  He got up and did his math homework as is ritual for everytime he has homework.  On his drive to school it was pouring out and when Tyke got to school he noticed the school bus parked outside the gym and he assumed it was the baseball bus as they were supposed to leave at 7:15 for the state semifinal.  But that definitely got cancelled.  Hardcore cancelled.  And then so did the 4A game(s) tonight so that means that Yakima is the place to be this weekend for the state championship for baseball.  And Kinker, etc, should win it cuz they are cool and Tyke goes to school with them.  And Kinker's tight.  In 1st period Tyke just got to talk with Maniak and Jew the whole period cuz hardly anyone was present.  And then weight training was a blast cuz they played Bump again.  And Tyke wasn't able to dominate.  Although he just kept draining 3's the person in front of him did the same until finally Tyke got screwed by his mere place in line.  He would be the first one up when a shot was taken and then if he missed the person behind him often would make it.  Just one of those luck of the draw things.  And the junior girl made her usual conversation with Tyke and that was fun.  Then came 3rd period meaning the final in-class presentations so now they are just putzing around for the next 2 days.  4th period was just a minor challenge for Tyke and Amed.  They went to Tyke's car before class started and dropped their bags off there so that they didn't have to take them out of class when they left early, ingenious idea of course.  Then they just waited for a great time to leave and Tyke said he was going to the bathroom while Amed just left and happened to time it as somebody was coming in so he wasn't expected.  They left 35 minutes early and went to Chili's for lunch.  After that they just drove around for a little before going back to school.  It was fun and relaxing just having the two of them.  It was cozy ;).  5th and 6th periods aren't really worth mentioning.  After school Tyke came home and got some food as the storm started.  It poured insane amounts of water down.  Tyke decided to drive his brother's car (he is at a wedding in San Fran this weekend if Tyke remembers right) to Cougar Ridge for basketball with Maniak, Tyronious, Dr. Phil, Amed, and Macaroon.  This wasn't a great pick at one point.  Right after Tyke got on the freeway all of a sudden he started to notice he wasn't seeing very well.  He thought it was just the rain so he slowed down a little bit.  But that didn't help.  So then he noticed he really wasn't being able to see.  And finally he was completely blind in front of him.  The windshield had completely fogged over and Tyke was driving blindly only knowing what was behind him in a car he hadn't driven in months.  Now this was a pretty freaky experience.  Finally Tyke rubbed the fog off the windshield with his hand and changed up the defroster so that it actually worked and he was fine from then on.  But those few seconds where he was blind he really realized how dangerous that was.  He easily could have hit something, spun out (he did go through big puddles of water without seeing them so he knows that could have made him lose control), or just gone off the road.  So that was quite a little experience.  Then they played basketball for a few hours which was fun.  And then Tyke went home.  And ate dinner.  And watched basketball.  And then planned the night.  DCups came over along with Kinker, Dr. Phil, Macaroon, Maniak, and Fejj.  Maniak was a true gentleman and brought over MVP Baseball which is hella tight.  They played poker and Tyke lost 10 bucks (his second buy-in he went all in the first hand and lost but it wasn't a big deal) but then he just played MVP and he really loves that game.  If he wasn't dropping $300 for prom right now he would go out and get it for sure.  But he'll have to wait.  Maniak allowed him to borrow it though so that means Tyke can have some fun with it as long as "no jizz gets on it."  Graphic, but still a quote.  Tyke took on Dr. Phil after everyone left and the Cubs (Tyke) beat the Mariners (Dr. Phil) 4-2.  It was a good battle.  And now, everything is done and Tyke can finally sleep.  He's tired.  Later.
