Is Nicole gonna have a movie night?? cuz I really want her to. i'm actually excited for the scary movies. hehe. but i dont think that it would be a good idea if the guys came over (luke and dave) not only cuz most of us wouldnt have anyone to hold onto, but because it might be a little wierd having guys coming to our movie nights. I say lets keep it to girls only. I think we should have movie nights every night. hehe jk. well thats it. love you all bunches and bunches. toodles.
