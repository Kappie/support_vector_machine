I, at least, am not going to kick her out. Also, as you are not an admin you don't set the rules, although I would prefer mild swear words (or badly misspelled ones ::cough  urlLink danmmed  cough::) to a constant stream of not-so-mild ones. One other thing is, we don't all always spell everything right. I know I don't.  To Emily: Tucker is right in that a proper respect for the rules should be maintained. However, as you did apologize, I don't see any real problem.  To Quiggy: Where the heck are you, Quiggy!? This blog is succumbing to chaos! There is looting and pillaging in the streets! Somebody, light the Quig-signal!  We need you Quiggy!
