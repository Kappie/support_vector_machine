Aint all bad tho-yeah yesterday met with Lisa Stadtmueller from the electron microscopy unit-a really cool place at the bottom of Madson building-its got 13 electron microscopes (both SEM, TEM), x-ray diffraction equipment, mass spectrometers... everything!! wish i could work there someday >.  Thermal/Mechanical Treatments of Light Alloys for Atom Probe Analysis   -What do I get to do? "The Atom Probe is EMUâ€™s latest acquisition and one of only 4 of itskind in the world. Work with a group to develop new specimen preparationtechniques involving electropolishing, Precision Ion Polishing Systemand/or Focused Ion Beam milling." sounds fun =P mmmm so gonna know not what to do tho >.   ok i'll stop procrastinating and go bak to ANCON =)   Thursday - Day 4   haha about 8 of us woke up around 5:45ish to watch the sunrise-which we didnt see coz there were clouds on the horizon! >.  In the morning session we learnt about 2 Corinthians chapter 10. The chapter talks about how us, as Christians, we have divine, God given power to demolish strongholds. Are Christians called to be wimps or warriors? Paul was said to be 'bold' when away and 'timid' face to face by others, saying "His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing"-however Paul remonstrates, saying that when present, actions speak louder than words. Also, he says that we are not to boast, except to boast in Jesus Christ.   During free time me and Ben wandered off to chat, play around with some music and practicing hacky sack for a while before heading off to watch 'theatre sports'-if you dont know what that is, its where you have different groups competing against each other in different theatric 'games' which are absolutely hilarious :P the different years were competing, with the 2nd years eventually winning on score by the judges, although all the groups were sooo funny i just couldnt stop laughing >.  so yeah the games were like-the 'space jump' game is where you have the host giving the first person in the team a scenario which they have to act out-for example, going to a Krispy Kreme shop. Then the person acts out the scenario, until the host yells 'spacejump' and the person acting has to freeze-then another person of the team jumps on, and then continues from that position into another scenario, which may be totally unrelated to the first-eg, in the Krispy Kreme scenario changes to a boss and servant scenario, with the boss scolding the servant. Then 'spacejump' is continued to be yelled, until all the team are onstage performing. Then each successive spacejump removes an actor, and the remaining ppl have to act out the previous scenario.... until nobody's left-really funni!! another is where u have ppl acting a scenarioi and have to change from different scenarios-eg drama, opera, etc....   Then we had the main session-of which the main question was about the Christian identity.   Step 1-The move from 'Christ died for us' to 'we died with/in him'-for we were 'buried with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life'.   Step 2-In Christ, therefore in the Spirit, therefore the Spirit in us-we are now dead to the body, but alive in the Spirit-and thus sons of God   Step 3-The Spirit is the Spirit of adoption-the Spirit bears witness that we are the sons of God-and hence all of us are sons of God, no matter of gender   Step 4-If children, then heirs-if we are God's children, then we are heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ-we are the heirs of eternal life and EVERYTHING   Then we investigated some complicated stuff about who we are, and how God sees us-who are we? After becoming a Christian, am I still the same me or a different person? Or am I half me and half Christ? or what? And how does God see me? Does God see me as I 'really' am, does God look past me seeing only Christ?   If we're Christians, how are we meant to live our lives?  1. We are to live in freedom and joy.  2. In obedience and holiness.  3. In the spiritual community of the new humanity.  4. In hope.   Thursday night was crazy but absolutely great fun-around 11:30pm or so, us from ACES along with many other ppl from other faculties decided to go to the headland, walking through the streets, beach and bushland. Eddie brought his guitar along, playing music along the way, and along the way we tried playing hacky-sack-not too successful as it was too dark to see but anyway it was great fun :) - then at the headland we looked at the great view in the dark-such a great view that yeah we just had to go see at midnight, freezing, and with a strong wind =P anyhow it was great fun chatting and singing !! :D afterwards we went back and played 500 till 3AM-couldve played longer but we had drivers in our group so yeah they had to go sleep :/   tired-sooo much time spent at uni-partly my fault for sleeping so late everyday tho =) so yeah i'll finish this off some other time! keke i kno-i will tho! l8rs!
