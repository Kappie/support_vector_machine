I think she articulates it all very nicely.  I'm tempted to add my own thoughts, since this is my weblog and everything, but I don't think I really have anything all that profound to add.  I think we all struggle with the balance between forcing ourselves to do stuff that isn't fun but we have to get it done versus trusting that we'll get it done without forcing ourselves.  And despite the track record -- I'm guessing most people in law school generally get stuff done that they need to get done, eventually, somehow -- it's still hard to trust that at some point before the paper's due, writing it will actually not feel like torture.  Okay, I guess I did add some thoughts of my own.  Whoops.  But not too many.
