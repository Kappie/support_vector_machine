It's an excellent,  non-time consuming  community service opportunity."  The italics are added by me.  If it's non-time consuming, sign me up.  BUT HOW CAN IT BE NON-TIME CONSUMING IF YOU HAVE TO DO ANYTHING?????  And if it's non-time consuming, then why are you telling me WHEN IT IS????? 12-5 is a time, last time I checked.  B. "Dear HLS Students:  Over the past week, we have received several requests to reserve the skating rink for hockey, broom ball, and other games."    Some "other games" on the law school skating rink:  1. "Falling and Suing" 2. "Slipping, Falling, and Suing"  3. "Slipping, Falling, and Suing, and Mock Trial" 4. "Slipping, Falling, Suing, Mock Trial, and Collecting Lawyers Fees" 5. "Ice Fishing"
