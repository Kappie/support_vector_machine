I'm not sure that  Excalibur  is, but I haven't seen that yet, and I'm pretty sure that Disney's  The Sword in the Stone , although cute, isn'tthe right one either-- although TH White is probably closer to right than wrong. I've also managed to miss  First Knight  with Gere/Ormond/Connery, so I'll have to reserve judgement on that one, too.  What the film got right, as far as I'm concerned, comes down to setting and sets. I liked the sets, liked the scenes at the Roman villa where they find Guinevere, liked the look of Hadrian's Wall and the castle (nice Round Table). I generally liked how the film was shot, too. What I liked about the setting mostly has to do with personal taste -- I'm not too keen on the sanitization of the medieval world. As my Old English professor would have said,  lif es sceort . And apparently dirty, too.  The casting was simply okay. Keira Knightley was kind of awkward as Guinevere, abit wooden and not exactly a believable revolutionary in my opinion; aesthetically, she's par for the course for a Bruckheimer film -- she looks pretty good for a Celtic warrior, although I found her quasi-S warrior woman outfit at the end of the film to be a bit much. Mind you, I know the Celts fought in the nude (or damn close to it), and I'm not saying I want to see that (even with attractive people, war in the buff falls under bad naked as far as I'm concerned), it's just that this was a little too modern looking (possibly) for my taste. Owen makes a fine Arthur, but he's given damn little room to do much. This makes sense, as Arthur rarely does anything in any of the stories anyhow. I could have done without his tortured cry as he kneels over the corpse of Lancelot. It rang really false to me. As for the rest of the cast, meh. Nothing good, nothing bad, nothing notable I can think of right now.  I'll continue this tomorrow (with what I really didn't like and what type of Arthur movie I think people would want), but for now, it's bedtime.
