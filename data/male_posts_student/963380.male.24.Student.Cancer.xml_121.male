Barry White was one of those fellows I never knew; unlike not knowing most other people, the not knowing of Barry White made my life worse, not better. To say that his music was really enjoyable was to perform a service to the term understatement. The words silky, lush, resounding, and sensual gained a layer of depth the first time Mr. White opened his mouth in a recording studio. Likewise he taught us that a throbbing, massaging bass can be loved without doffing masculinity. Barry, for many of us, coined the term aural sex.  As many of my favorite members of celebrity society begin to pass on, I feel small parts of myself die also. It wounds me that I was born thirty years too late to enjoy the work of these people in their prime. Real rather than retro; premiers instead of passe. Kate Hepburn just moved on - ending an era on her own. Now Barry.  You'll be missed, Mr. White, and not just by me.
