Having negative thoughts, corrupting your mind.  ~ Things are getting complicated to me nowadays too. Results are proving that I didn't give it my best this time around. The burden of finishing the Interact Annual Report is giving me a lot of stress. Luckily, the deadline for the submission is postponed to 15th of June. Hopefully, we can compete with other schools in at least 1 of the awards.  Sau Mei and Rachael and I went to Montaine Fitness and Health Centre in Menara Weld today. The people there are so friendly except for maybe 1  le...  All three of us tried the foot reflexology. It was painful for me. I tried the body relaxation massage too. It was quite relaxing... Rachael is even planning to go for a work-out session this Friday....  ~ Just got back my english paper results. I scored the same marks with Kelly and May Yenn. How nice. Amber as usual got the highest in my class with 91 marks. Congrats!  "What we anticipate seldom occurs: but what we least expect generally happens" - Benjamin Disraeli
