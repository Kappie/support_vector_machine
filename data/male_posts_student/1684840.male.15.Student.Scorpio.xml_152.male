Because of it's old age (back in the ol' days, when people weren't as dirty minded as us modern folk), the people acting had no idea that what they were saying sounded really funny!  Anyway, back to today lol.  School was ok I guess.  I didn't do as bad as I expected to do in the Food Tech. exam.  Lauren made it loud and clear that it was her birthday by getting it written on the board lol.  I don't know if It's just me or the sandwhiches in the canteen are getting a bit crusty round the edges.  It's not very pleasant!  OMG!!  The Science department has lost my Science exam paper lol!  How funny!  I thought I did quite crap in the test anyway.  I wonder if I could sneakily find it before they do, erase it digitally and then redo it mwahaha!  Only jokin ;)  The Biology lesson was okay anyways, I thought a clump of cells which had the same functions was called a tumour lmao, when (duh) it's tissue!  Back home, I've been flashing away (Flashing as in creating Flash Animations... NOT exposing myself...).  I made a wicked interactive animation to kick Brannan's arse!  Sorry james it had to be done lmao.  Now people from all over the world can  Kick Brannan Up The Arse ! Mwahahaha
