At least my website is up at  urlLink dragontail.tk . It needs some updating, but i cant do that till the exams are over. Yaaaay. At least we can have a few LAN parties after the exams though. Some CS and generals/ RA2 would soothe the mind... and I can 0wn! >:D muwahha-*cough* ahem. Anyway, James said he would kick me off if i didnt post :( ain't my fault :( Bad times, people, till next time,   Jamie  ----------------------------------------  feel like punching the wall?
