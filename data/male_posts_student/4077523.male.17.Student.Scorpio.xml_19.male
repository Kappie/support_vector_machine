At first I really didn't want to go, simply because, I knew what I missed out on and that made me a bit sad. But then I started thinking, it doesn't matter if I went or not, I mean I know I missed out on some fun stuff but, it's not about what I want, it is about what God wants for me. I hope that makes sense and if it doesn't let me know and I will try to rephrase it.      I just wanted to take time to say thanks for the prayers whoever has seen this and prayed for me. They are really helping. Whitney and Dawn, if one or both of you ever stumble across this blog thank you for the prayers also. Chelsey, thanks for being there for me in the past, and being someone I could talk to. Thanks Davis, you tha man!, you have been someone else I could talk to, oh yeah and if you see this Davis, tell Caroline I said Hey!, haha. And thanks Tiffany J. for being a good friend to me.      Oh, and Jay Rod! I know you have moved to Florida, and I am sorry that I didn't have a chance to say bye and I thought you were leaving later. But you have been a great friend and I am glad I know you. I will miss ya! Let me know how things are going.      Well that is all for now, and thanks to anyone I have forgot to mention, I probably forgot a few since I am being rushed. Anywho, please keep praying and I will post later. -Fly With Christ
