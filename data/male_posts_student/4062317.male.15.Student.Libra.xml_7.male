Anyways  I was sitting at home doing nothing and I came across the FMP that I had burned off of some poor schmuk. Well I put it in my laptop and started watching it. After I was done watchin a few episodes I thought back to how I always used to watch anime. Just a few years ago I wouldnt watch anything unless it was anime no matter how gay the story might have been or if it was even for kids it didnt matter to me.  So eventually I just stopped watching anime but when i put on FMP i was really suprised how much I enjoyed it. So this is where your part come Yuiichi, could you just give me some advice on some good animes to download since you are all ways downloading.  Lates,  Smog
