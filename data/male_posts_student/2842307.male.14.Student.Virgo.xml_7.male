As the school holidays draws to a close, I cannot help but ponder why as we grow older, time seems to tick away faster. It seems to me that a single day passes in a flash. Sometimes, I just wish that I could turn back the clock and undo certain things but I know that is not possible. Therefore, I am committed to looking ahead and preparing for the future instead of dwelling on the past. That's all. Have a nice day!
