I have never felt like this for a very long time since secondary school days. But I need to exercise to keep myself in shape. I have notice some progess. I trying to get that six pack. I know its difficult but nothing is impossible.  Got back my semester 2 results. Not too happy with it though. I got four B's , one C  and two D. I am happy that I pass all but I know i should have done better. What is done is done? I should now look forward to year 2 with higher expectations and goals.
