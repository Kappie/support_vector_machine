The quizzing club and the debatingsociety have already organized many and I think its time for the computer club to do something. Ofcourse we have the d 2  coming up, but it is not exactly an inter section competition. We have good quizzers, web designers,programmers etc. and can easily make quality questions. So why not hold an intersection event?
