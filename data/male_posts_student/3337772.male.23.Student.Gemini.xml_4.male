Lia came with me for the first time (I believe it's my second time there...) most of the time, Lia was pratically invisible - sitting under my chair... 'til someone came to me (well, really... to talk with Lauren...) and Lia would poke her head between my legs and try to get affection from others!  When we first entered Ulana's, Lia had her vest on... but I knew people would want to pet her, which they're not supposed to... with her vest on.  So, I left her vest off, and Lia was totally chillin' out... Tonight was a fun night.
