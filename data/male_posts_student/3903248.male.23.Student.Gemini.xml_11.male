Blog = Weblog = Random stuff I decide to put on here.  Just in case you didn't know.  Anyway, the other day I got a new camera.  It is seriously bad ass.    Check it out:   urlLink Minolta DiMAGE Z1   In the past 3 days I have taken well over 400 pictures.  I think I have found my new hobby.  As soon as I can get the coding worked out I'll post some of the pictures on here.  Speaking of pictures, Jon and I went fishing yesterday.  We hadn't been fishing together in a long ass time.  We couldn't find any of our rods so we ended up going to Wal-Mart and buying a couple Zebco 202's.  Yes, we were desperate.  We get to Lake Ashbaugh, make a few casts, and I catch a fish.  This is an amazing feat for several reasons.  The main reason is the fact that the lake was just drained and killed off last year.  We were shocked there were already catchable fish in the lake.  We caught a few fish, took some pictures, Jon lost what can only be described as the Lake Ashbaugh Monster; snapped 10lb. test like it was nothing.  Oh, Jon caught a damn Dragonfly.  Don't ask me how, but it happened, I have the pictures to prove it.  Speaking of, I'll have the pictures of the trip up ASAP.  Until then, I'm gonna go steal one of Bill's smokes (cause Marlboro Ultra Light 100's are just ghey) and get some sleep.  Until then...
