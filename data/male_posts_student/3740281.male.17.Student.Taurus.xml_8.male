(yeah i know...i dont really wanna be here but i hope somethin happens to get me to stay...its not a typo...thats just how fucked up in the head iam, i really dont know what i want...)but i doubt it will happen...its a huge long shot. But w/e i'll take my chances.  Anyways, if you've heard of MAH and wanna go, or if you just wanna go and see why im so excited to see them....lemme know. its 9 bux at the door... and in Corona at the Ground Zero Building.
