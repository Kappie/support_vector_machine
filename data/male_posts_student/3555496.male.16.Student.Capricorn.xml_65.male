I rolled to band, marched  The Box  like a thousand and 2 times. I hate  The Box . It sounds sinister,  The Box  does. You know why? It's one of Satan's creations... yeah he decided to make something completely lame and boring, so he created  The Box . What a weenie.  Last night I saw  The Village . It really pissed me off. M. Night Shinanigans or whoever should have just called it Signs 2: The Sequel cus it really bit the big one. Aah listen to me, just LISTEN! Don't waste your money... and if you still want to see it, go watch it at Willowbrook Mall, cus those hotties are HOT. And at the theater, those hotties are even hotter!! To bad I'm like fugly because man... they were like unreal.  I had authentic fried rice today. Mike Sinabe got his mom to make shrimp fried rice (at my request) and we dug into it at Alan's for lunch. It was  damn  good.  Wow man the cheerleaders came out to practice outside. Then get this: the colorguard came out after them... I was confused! I couldn't choose which group to stare at more... I like fell down on the cement and started foaming at the mouth and going into convulsions. Sike! I actually got a spot in the show, but I wasn't really proud of myself. I think they put me in there by default; two of the other four baritones really  urlLink suck . No doubt dawg, no doubt.  I took a shower when I got home at 5:30 because I smelled like  BOOTY  .  I changed my threads and there was like a  James Coney Island  box  on the counter, so of course I was all over that shit  like a hobo on a ham sandwich .  Well we have some gayass attempt to get our 'rents involved in the Band Boosters tonight. They call it a concert, I call it a scam. Either way, it's a waste of my time.  I better get going so I can continue to pick on the freshman before they get there. I need some gas.  DUCE!!
