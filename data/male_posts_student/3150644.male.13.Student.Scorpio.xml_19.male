Latin is a dead language,  thus it can be used for scientific names, mottos, and sympolic  meanings. Here is a Latin phrase you should know; if you don't, then  learn it.    Nil Sine Labore  [neelsee-naeler-bor-rae]  Latin for "Nothing Without Labour". Used as a motto for  urlLink Victoria School  and  urlLink Victoria Junior College . Used a  personal maxim by most Victorians.   Â©Copyright jeremi.define
