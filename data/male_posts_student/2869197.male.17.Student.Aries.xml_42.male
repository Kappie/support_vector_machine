I love the candy parades on Memorial Day. I know Memorial Day is to honor our veterans and soldiers, but since I was a child, all that mattered was the candy tossed from on high, like manna falling from the heavens. Now I am the tosser and I enjoy it immensely. The cry of joy, the mad rush to the fallen manna, the silent and sneaky toss to the child who was not fast enough to grab the candy. It's beautiful in its own way.
