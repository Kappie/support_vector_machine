Presentations this year have been quite easy.  Tyke just says some funny, random stuff and it makes the presentation seem good.  It may not be intelligent but it at least is entertaining.  2nd period was legs day which is a pretty good day for Tyke because he gets to show up his group in leg strength.  Nirvana is so good.  Tyke has been listening to Nirvana Unplugged.  That is probably his favorite Nirvana CD.  Nevermind is great too though.  And basically that's all about that.  3rd period was great.  Hardly any educational work at all.  Almost all group work/talk.  Then 4th period was its usual inane self but Tyke played a little game with the teacher without her knowing it.  He used both his fingers to flick her off and just kept doing it and would coyly retract them if she was looking at him but he just did this and did it in creative ways for a few minutes.  But then he got tired of doing it.  Man, that teacher is stupid.  So is that class.  Lunch at pie was as tasty as ever.  The rest of the day slipped by and was unnoticed for the most part.  After school Tyke came home and just watched TV.  He then fell asleep for short periods of time multiple times.  All before his court appointment at 5:45.  But he still got there early.  Traffic court was fun though.  Quite fun.  And not serious at all.  Tyke met up with Maniak and M and they went in and took their seats.  Basically, as Tyke has typed out this story so much tonight that he is tired of typing it so he will just start telling it in person from now on, Tyke made a mockery out of traffic court with his speech and got 15 hours of comm service which is pretty good.  He was filmed by Quesa for VTV and hopefully that will get put up there.  Cuz it should be pretty funny.  And Maniak's speech was quite funny as well.  He diagrammed his situation and also brought out the race card.  He talked about how he got the ticket cuz he had 3 asians in his car while the car in front of him got let out of it and there were 2 white guys in that car.  Hmmm...coincidence???  Almost definitely not.  So that was fun and next month Tyke and Maniak have decided they are going to go watch again.  It is quite entertaining.  After that Tyke has just collected some change and made about 20 bucks by doing that.  Then he folded some whites.  Laundry that is.  And that is pretty much all.  Shucks...Tyke could have gotten this blog out a few minutes earlier but that's ok.  Most likely no harm done.  Here it comes internet...READ ME!!!
