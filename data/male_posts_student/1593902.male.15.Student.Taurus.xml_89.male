I think my paranoia alone is enough to kill a good 20% of my relationships. My annoying tendencies kill 10% more and my fucked up personality/ looks, is anohter 50%. The fact that any normal guy is more attractive does in another 10% Another 5 percent goes into the fact that i'm an oddball. 2.5% goes to the fact i hang around to0 many women. 2.4% more goes to the fact that i'm too nice, i'm too sweet i'm too overly good, i dedicate myself too much, and plenty of women rather have the other typ eof guy.  that .1% left is prolly non-existent
