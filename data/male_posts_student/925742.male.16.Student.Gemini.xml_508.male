It was awesome.  Yesterday I forget.  I'll remember later.  Today I ran 20 laps in the gym for being late and then a lap around the track and even more running for soccer.  Running angers me.  Really.  So yeah, and I didn't have to present my work today in English so Kim and I both sorta lucked out.  Hahaha Ms Kalkman is hilarious.  OH man, speaking of hilarious, I showed my audio tape in class today.  Everyone laughed.  My God, I was embarrassed though.
