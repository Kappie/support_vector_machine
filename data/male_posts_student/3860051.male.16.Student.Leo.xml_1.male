By obsessed I mean persistent in the manner of trying to screw me when she knows I dislike her greatly.   I've tried everything I can think of,   I've tried telling her to leave me alone, I've said I have a girlfriend,   and I've been trying to avoid her at all cost.   She calls me everyday, which is what my mother tells me.   But luckely for me I've been at my friends house everyday since Summer School ended so    I haven't had to talk to her. She pesters me on my xanga site as well as my livejournal.   I might as well just keep avoiding her and make new accounts on those sites.   Luckely she knows not of this site.   She is the queen of gross and most of friends think that I like her when I tell them this.   She has a boyfriend and still she bugs the crap out of me and trys to climb all over me.   I've actually almost vomited on her before when she touched my hand.   PLEASE HELP ME WITH YOUR ADVICE!
