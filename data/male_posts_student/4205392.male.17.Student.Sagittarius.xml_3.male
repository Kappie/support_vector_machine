I dunno if I've been tainted with ideas of nice truck stop people from Grapes of Wrath, but there was something quiet and stoic about the lady that just made me pause as she scooped up ice cream fo rme. She is like the mountins here...a bit large, somewhat formidible, probably here for years upon years, working tis lonely truck stop serving truckers thier black coffee and tourists their ice cream. THere was something about the lady that just really did make me feel like a little farmerboy. I'm 17 yeasr old, but I really don't know anything about anything that really matters. When she gave me my ice cream, I said "Thank you m'am." She kinda smiled.
