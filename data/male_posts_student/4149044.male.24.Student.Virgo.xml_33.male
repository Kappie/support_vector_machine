To make matter worse, I really need to drag my ass to the gym later since it'll be closed tomorrow due to UTD's graduation ceremonies. Wonderful. Right now, going downstairs completely wears me out..the thought of skullcrushers and close-grip supersets really doesn't seem too appealing.     Grace is going to Houston this weekend with her dad and sis..to see a freaking "fortune teller." Yea yea I know that's not the only reason, but geezus is that  really  necessary? Ok I've bitched enough about this to her already so I'll just leave it at that.    I feel like buying something. Buying shit always makes me feel better. It's a temporary fix but who cares right? I want another pair of Pumas, though I honestly don't know if the one I want even exists. Maybe I'll go to Neimans later and look for these imaginary sneakers. I'm such a dumbass. I could also use a new pair of workout shoes..Shox are kind of overdone so maybe something else. It seems like every 90lb muscle-tee-wearing douchebag at the gym has a pair. You know the type..they walk around with their arms all flared out, acting as if their lats are just  that damn wide . They also only work chest and arms, but spend just as much time posing and flexing in front of the mirrors. Bench-pressing with their asses high up in the air, and then loading up the preacher curl rack to blast their awesome 13-inch guns..real annoying shit. I admit I'm not a real big guy (hell I honestly think I'm fat, even with a six-pack), but I respect the game, the lifestyle. Asshole pricks who go in acting like they're the shit because they can curl or press x amount of weight..damn that irritates me.    Ok, I'm getting off my ass. I need to do something. Cherries sound good right about now. I guess I'll go wander around Super Target for a while before hitting the gym. Some people are supposed to come over later to fix some shit in my house, so I gotta be home for that. Maybe I can convince someone to go watch a movie with me later. Not sure if anything good is opening this weekend, but I do know that I don't want to see The Village. Jon said it blows.. and Jon's always right.
