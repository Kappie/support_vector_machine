I don't know.  It's weird when someone asks me how old I am, and it takes me a second to figure it out or my gut impulse is to say 21.  Why is my default response stuck on 21?  Maybe I have serious problems and should seek professional help.  Nonetheless, I find myself in this perplexing state of mind.  I wonder, does it get any better once you get older, or will I have to calculate my age every time someone asks me from this point forward?
