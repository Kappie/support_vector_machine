My father really worked hard, he is such a great man.    CHAOS THEORY:   Chaos is qualitative in that it seeks to know the generalcharacter of a systems long-term behavior, rather thanseeking numerical predictions about a future state. Whatcharacteristics will all solutions of a system exhibit? Howdoes this system change from exhibiting one behavior toanother?Chaotic systems are unstable since they tend not to resistany outside disturbances but instead react in significantways. In other words, they do not shrug off externalinfluences but are partly navigated by them.The variables describing the state of a system do notdemonstrate a regular repetition of values and are therefore aperiodic. This unstable aperiodic behavior is highlycomplex since it never repeats and continues to show theeffects of the disturbance(s). These systems are deterministic because they are made upof few, simple differential equations, and make noreferences to implicit chance mechanisms. This is not to be completely equated with the metaphysical or philosophicalidea of determinism (that human choices could bepredetermined as well).Finally, a dynamic system is a simplified model for thetime-varying behavior of an actual system. These systemsare described using differential equations specifying therates of change for each variable.     I was researching the "Choas Theory" last night. Its a psychological theory that tries to eliminate anxiety or control by stating nature and humans are chaotic in nature. There are infinite outcomes to each SEEMINGLY insignificant action we make. We are not linear in nature. That Malcom guy in  Jurassic Park  was a chaos theorist. The  Butterfly Effect  is a movie about this, too. The "butterfly effect" was coined by some astrologer at MIT, he said a butterfly flapping its wings on one side of the world, chaotically, can cause a typhoon on the other. Deep shit. It makes one really analyze each action they do. Life is so unpredictable, often in my own, I try to control things I am now realizing I have no control over. Its hard to live in the "now," especially within a society so geared on the future. Also I wonder if chaos can describe fate? Maybe our lives are predetermined and chaos is the "force" that acts upon us keeping our path the same. Nature is chaotic, order, is a dream of man. This means my life should always be a roller coaster. The bumps are chaos, how I react, is who I am -that is life. Life is a reaction. To master self control is to master life. To master life one must master themselves. I can only control my own actions, I must learn how to react appropiately to the actions of others. I am starting to understand...    Last night was a perfect example. I am analyzing one INSIGNIFICANT event and all of the outcomes. It affected like 10 people!!! This is AMAZING. Chaos at work... I couldn't have dreamed of a better example. Ten lives each effected by one dance. Fucking amazing... And the apparent lack of self control, obviously by people who are extremely far from self actualization. My reaction could have been a little better, but I am definitely improving. I can't believe it...DEFINITELY NEED MORE RESEARCH ON CHAOS.
