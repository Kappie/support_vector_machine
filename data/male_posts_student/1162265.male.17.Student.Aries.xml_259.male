Perhaps it's that completely irrational anger, that I'm prone to, but it really bothered me how they not only did the hall sweep, which I got 'caught' in while trying to return to class with my formally lockered text book.    So, white people were freaking out, that the hall sweeps didn't just apply to black people and I was about to get swept up in the hysteria, until I realized it was kind of pointless to be mad at the people doing the hall sweeps, since it wasn't their genius idea, and they wouldn't change anything.  I'm leaving, though, and mr. flatop (who sent me in the office in the first place) starts trying to do his "I was hired cause I'm a scary black dude" thing, and I'm trying to explain to this pendajo that my pass was in my hand, but apparently to him I was only talking back.  Taldy (Tall Bald Security Guard) had to convince him that yes, indeed I was carrying the 8.5x11 piece of yellow paper in my hand.  What a jack ass, but I've had him yelling at me before (for asking questions) funny.  Oh man, and then throughout the day white people are like "Yeah, they bother you cause your black", I find that slightly hard to believe.  I think it's more a matter of, how many black people are around.  We seem to attract trouble in larger numbers, rather then being singled out directly.  But some of the stories people tell me just piss me off, to see how easily white people, hell just about anyone who has few black characteristics, do actually get off the hook with the black security guards.  Now, I don't want to go all Stef (from the Cafeteria incident last year) and call the Security Guards Uncle Toms but something definitely doesn't sit right.  Okay, and my mystery has only gotten more confusing.  It's funny how things in real life tend to as mysterious as they are in fiction.
