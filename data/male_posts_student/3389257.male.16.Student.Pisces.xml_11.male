I'd like to say your welcome for putting you onto Sarah. it is a shame things turned out like crabs on a stag night. Again I'd like to say crabs. It was rather fun. Crabs. Crabs. Right now I am listening to dashboard and pretending to be emo by poking my eyes till they water. I would like to give a round of applause to Hollie for punching someone called belly. I have no idea who he is. apparently he pissed her off much so. unfortunate I guess. I would also like to give abig round of applause to my brother for getting hit in the arse high speed by a frisbee without crying. at it boy. coming out of that emo phase. thank god. till next time. crabs.
