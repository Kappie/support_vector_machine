Erm... today is another tiring day in school... and really blame myself for being real lazy sometimes... still have one whole stack of tutorial not done yet... even when i am typing this entry now... i still have two tutorial to rush... Organisational Behaviour and Business Statistics... hrm... hope i will push myself to cope better... hrm... Thank God for pulling me through... anyway... after today's school... i went over for Joey's place to do discipleship with him.... though he have been some one who give me quite some problem... but i seem him grow... its such a wonderful sight to see someone grow... grow mature... grow strong in the Lord... All Honor goes to the Lord... God is good!!... happy to see the brothers grow so well...    Seems To Be Thinking over the issues of the problems nowadays ... dunno whats happening in me... i think most importantly is to pray i guess... set my life real strict before God... hrm....   Hey ShiJun, thanks for the comment you made... but ... i can tell you ... i have faith that God is real.... though i can't see him... but i can feel him... though i can't touch him .... i can hear him.... he speaks to me everyday and guide me along... but many times i think i just ignore him... i just have to tune myself even more sensitive to him... There is a heaven becoz there is a God... and i just believe so... keke... i duno how to explain... but i just have to say... he is just so great... nv think of ending your life... for what? think of how are you gonna lead your this life well... finish it to the end... dun give up half way.... thought of joining me in church to feel the Love ? come m'on... join me!
