Quote - A spokesman for the French brigade in charge in northern Kosovo, Lt. Matthieu Mabin, said the violence had spread too quickly and across too wide an area. "We can't protect everywhere all of the time," he said. "It's the reality on the ground, very simply."    Yeah, let's turn Iraq over to the UN, as soon as possible!  That will make everything much better.
