I do really love the music they're playing. It's like a trip down memory lane. And that's the time where I do listen to REAL music.  Honestly, I do appreciate the songs that they say  pinag-lumaan na ng panahon . But Ido appreciatethe present songs.  Today is Friday. Tomorrow wil be Saturday... My worst day of the week. NSTP. And I do not like my classmates. Good thing Shayne, Ging, Rodel, Mark and Hanna are still my classmates. And I'm adding three more classmates who I consider NORMAL people... Rochelle, Blenda, and Constancio (also known as Marina)...
