It puts into words very accurately and concisely how important I believe perspective is.  I think it is unfortunate that at times we hear the cliché about how important attitude is that whenever we hear it we quickly dismiss it by stating that “we know” and “I’ve heard that.”  And I do mean dismiss…I am not sure we really realize how significant our perspective is.  From any point of view, philosophical, skepticism, religious, pragmatism, cynicism, and so forth all recognize the importance of perspective, while creating the interesting situation of being a perspective themselves, talking about the importance of perspective.  But here is one short and quick argument for the absolute superiority of perspective.  Philosophically speaking, nothing in this world, including the world, can be proven to exist.  Descartes’ famous “I think therefore I am” is actually inadequate to prove one’s existence, as it assumes being before the being thinks when the statement is deconstructed.  The best that can be said is that there I doubt, and doubt implies a doubter, but there is no guarantee that the doubt is “your” doubt.  Science, which many people prove to, is based on a reasoning method known as induction.  Deductive arguments proves something is true if the premises are true.  Induction, which is science, makes it so that if the premises are true, the conclusion is only probably true.  This means that all of the scientific “truths” of our world…i.e. gravity, light, sound, and the discoveries of biology, chemistry, and physics, and so forth, since they are all based on our senses and our interpretation of our senses, is induction, and therefore gravity, although our experience, which may not really be our own remember, tells us that it is always true.  However, the point is that technically and logically speaking, all scientific truths are only probably true. This argument is only offered to show that since so much of our everyday world is unknown, and consequently very much out of out control in our everyday actions, that how we view the world may be the one aspect of our existence that we truly can exercise complete control over.  Everything else, our knowledge, our experience, and our science are all, to some extent, outside of our control.  Whereas, our perspective, while it can be influenced by external forces such as family, society, and circumstance, is something that can be determined independently.  When determining our perspective, we can consider these factors and reject our accept them, their influence, in an ultimate sense, is dependent on us. This is very elementary at this point, but just something that I was thinking about…possibly the beginnings of something more involved and detailed.  Just trying to show how important perspective is and how it may be the only thing that we can really control, and how we should have more respect for it.
