[Break - Mario Winans]   Did he touch you better then me (touch you better then me)   Did he watch you fall asleep (watch you fall asleep)   Did you show him all those things that you used to do to me (do to me baby)   If your better off that way (better off that way)   Baby what I like to say (all that I can say)   Go on and do your thing and don't come back to me(Stay away from me baby)   [Verse 3 - P. Diddy]   I don't wanna know where your whereabouts or how you movin   I know when you in the house or when you cruisinIt's been proven, my love you abusin   I can't understand, how a man got you choosin (yeah)   Undecided, I came and provided ma   My undivided, you came and denied it (why?)   Don't even try it, I know when you lyin (I know when you lyin)   Don't even do that, I know why you cryin (stop cryin)   I'm not applyin no pressure, just wanna let you know   That I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna let you go)   And I don't wanna let you leaveCan't say I didn't let you breathe   Gave you extra cheese (c'mon), put you in the SUV   You wanted ice so I made you freeze   Made you hot like the West Indies (that's right)   Now it's time you invest in me   Cause if not then it's best you leave   Holla, yeah   well... i've still got something for sue.. i just wanna know the truth that's all.. i don't wanna evade from reality like you do. i pray to someone from above to come and mend my confused sentiments. i hope that it'll all be resolved.    this melvin guy that she's together with won't give her as much as her other suitors can. he's an AH BENG! i don't wanna be together with her. but i want her to be together with a better man. not someone who's a total shitmuthafucka. i think i'll wash my hands clean off her from now on. bye sue.
