Today's grade for the evil college exam from hell is ........................................... drum roll please ................................................................................................... 4. Out of 5. That is okay but, you know, still kind of disappointing. I was expecting to make a two.  Wasting my time today on worthless summer assignments.  The Awakening  (Chopin) is an okay waste of time, because it sparks the most minute amount of interest possible for a summer assignment. I would still rather be reading Francisca Lia Block. Poetry in written form. Not this formal fiction about an artist.  Oh, by the way, I have added several links to other blogs. To your right, you will find the link to Elise's blog (Just Dream),  not  to be confused with her site, when doves cry. Also you might find Brock's site (The Bat Cave) as well as the blog I have very recently become aware of, ZoÃ«'s blog (KiwiAGoGo). Have fun.  Cheers, mortals.
