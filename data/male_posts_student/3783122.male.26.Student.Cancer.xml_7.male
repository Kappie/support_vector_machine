There I was walking back to my math class late this afternoon and there sitting in a park bench waiting for me to come sit down, were my parents. (Thanks to the diligent work that my brother Ross and his wife Adree have done they are now GRANDPARENTS! Congrats to Ross and Adree on the new addition to the Wright family.) So I sat next to my parents and had a really nice chat with them but for some reason they just didn't have all that much to say to me. Oddly the didn't seem to notice me. Well I was soon running late and I moved on to class.
