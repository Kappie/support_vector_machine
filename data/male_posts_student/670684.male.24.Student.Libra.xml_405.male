My penchant for grabass mixed with the unwanted feelings, and funkage ensued.    24.  M.A., Screenwriting.  No job.  Debt.    But I think it mostly comes from my want to stay in Austin.  I really enjoy this city...the climate, the people, the proximity to things I enjoy.  It's possible that a lot of this comes from my lack of work the past two years; Austin is no longer a work city as it was in my Starbucks days, but now a school city that I can wake up late and shower myself in ineptitude in.    The fear is that the reason I desire Austin is because it is safe.  I moved to Austin because it was safe.  Crazy statement, considering I was poor and knew no one when I arrived, but it was close to Shreveport.  Close to Arkansas.  Close enough that if something went wrong, I could handle it.    I hate saying goodbye.  And most of the people I know are saying goodbye.  And I should be able to say it, and get in the car and wave as I take on a new place...I'm good at being the new guy.  But I can't read whether this indecision is fear, or if I've found a place I wouldn't mind staying in.    Finding work would make this easy, but there's not a overflowing market for grads of screenwriting.  Especially those with small portfolios.    The fog is clearing, somewhat, and Oat Willie is leading me to the promise land maybe?  It's late.  I'm headed to Arkansas for a few days of relaxation with the med school D's, and hopefully some time that I can get my own shit together.  This week has been good so far, a lot of personal work done.  I'm good at motivating myself to work hard...just not in the way of quitting soda and running laps.
