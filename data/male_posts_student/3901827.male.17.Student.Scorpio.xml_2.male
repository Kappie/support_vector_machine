I've noticed that the human race as a whole has a tendency to reminisce over our worst moments, or times in history filled with death or failings as a people.  Is not World War II considered the most devastating war in the history of the world? And yet it is one of the most documented and reused scenario in television and radio interests.  The airwaves are swarmed by specials or documentaries, new findings in our continous evaluation of the war.        Our fascination with WWII is merely a taste of the total interest placed upon warfare around the world, with many organizations living off of it like some foul parasite, or even incorporating it as one of their central concepts, such as the Shi'ite muslim belief in Jihaad to punish the heathenous nations of the world.       Not only are we obsessed with war, we are determined as a people to relive past trials and travesties of humanity.  One prominent example is the constant subject of the Holocaust, not in the least lessened by the guilt-mongering of the Jews. How about America's fascination with the 9/11 attacks?  It's often the center of conversation years later, as more and more worldwide strife spring from the diseased and withered loins.      So we find that not only our civil governments are run by this macabre drive, but so are a great lot of our religious institutions.  The grand majority of churches in the world base themselves on the shunning and torture of a heavenly figure in the depths of history, or the trials they faced as a group at their formation, and take great pride in their noble heritage.      The human race must hope to gain some sort of knowledge or wisdom from reliving the tragedies of the past, but it strikes me as just a way of perpetuating outmoded ideas or views.  And to those who say, "Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it," We haven't done such a great job of escaping these trends, despite the constant shadow of the past.
