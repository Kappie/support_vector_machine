Then you wonder how you lost the election four years ago.  Sure, you won the popular vote, but just imagine...You might have won those 528 votes in Florida if you hadn't been such a scathing liberal nutjob.     There has been a particular precedent for losing candidates in the past, they are rarely seen or heard from again, save the occasional goodwill trip to Haiti or some other country that isn't quite important.  They have a duty to this nation for doing the little, but necessary, things.  Giving speeches that would make even Hitler's theatrical coach blush isn't close to what an elder statesman such as yourself should be doing.  Here is a list of things that are more productive...  1)  President of the Keep-the-Expos-in-Montreal Association 2)  Helping to revive Craig T. Nelson's sagging acting career 3)  Writing a book on your favorite one-hit wonder band, Chumbawumba 4)  Hosting a talk show on the Lifetime channel in between reruns of the Golden Girls and the Nanny 5)  Reinventing "Double Dare" for past hippies 6)  Starting an NPR show that mainly deals with varying different types of fall foliage 7)  Opening a restaurant that serves food that does not harm the environment (no meat, no veggies, mostly just recycled paper and rainwater)   Of course there are many more things that would be more productive than you ranting and raving against the Bush administration, but I suppose you are happy doing just that.  Perhaps one of these days, you will finally call Bill.  It's been four years.  Just call to say 'What's up?'  I think he would appreciate that.  He would probably tell you to 'Shut the hell up', but you wouldn't listen to him in 2000 and gosh darnit, you probably won't listen to him now.  Well, I hope this letter finds you in good health and low blood pressure, please stay in touch and just remember...Just because a leftist group asks you to speak...It doesn't mean you have to have a conniption fit.  God Bless,   Tony DeFranco
