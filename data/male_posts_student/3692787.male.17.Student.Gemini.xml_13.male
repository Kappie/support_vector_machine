But it is all right; I shall wait. I have been waiting long enough, but still, I know you will come around eventually.  Did you know that I waited for hours outside the bookstore? You said you would walk home with me. Do you remember? You even wished that it would rain. Ah, you are after my heart itself dear! Long have I wished for someone to share my sentiments with the rain. I could never understand why people dreaded walking in the rain.It's only water, it's not gonna kill you! Long have I walked alone amidst the downpours and the storms, but now, now I have you to walk with... or so I thought. It would seem I had at least one more wave of angels' tears to traverse all by myself...  I was thinking of you as I looked up at the stars last night. My, they are amazing! We have such a perfect view of them from this realm! You like them as well, do you not? Yes, I am quite certain that you do. I feel so lost when I look at them. It is as if they are calling out to me, as if I should not be here at this moment, as if someone, somewhere, wills me to be there, as if that is where I should have been all along... Do you think that could be true? I hope so. This world is far too sad for me. Why, if I knew not of your existence here I would not bother with it at all.  Please do hurry...How I wish thatyou are able to make it to dinner. Ah, you will enjoy what I have prepared! It's a surprise though, just for the two of us. But, oh dear, it will not last very long. The food is getting cold, the roses are wilting,and the candles are slowly melting into tiny puddles of wax. Even the violinist's patience grows thin, but please, do not be mad at him; he is human after all, only sent here by thememory of those great menwho have long since transcended this mortal plane. If he leaves though, it is all right still. I shall remain; my patience for you is timeless, as well it should be, wouldn't you agree? Purpose is not bound by the laws of time and space. I will be with you. I have to be with you. I know not when, I know not how, but I know that I shall remain forever restless if I do not discover the path that will lead me to you.  I have said it before, but I have been waiting for far too long. I have been searching for far too long as well. You are here, and you will be with me soon. I know you will be. I can feel it. However, I am exhausted. I can search for you no longer, so I will stick to waiting, as I have been for quite some time now. But I know that you are on this oblate spheroid somewhere, and I know that you are lonely. My, what a coincidence! I too am lonely. If only we could be lonely together...  Find me, child. Find me with all haste. It is not that difficult at all. You only need to search for the fool who walks amidst the rain and stares up at the stars with all longing--wanting, searching, waiting...  completely wrong thought of the day: "It was like a million shards of glass piercing my heart from all sides at the same time..." --sentiments of a car crash survivor "...oh wait. It actually  was.
