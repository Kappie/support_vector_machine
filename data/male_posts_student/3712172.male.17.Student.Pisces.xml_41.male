With work, and early mornings I feel I need a break. Welcome to "Real Life" though I suppose. I guess that's why a lot of adults don't go out as much as teenagers - they like their days to relax.   Relaxing is a good thing though, and it's healthy. If I didn't choose to rejuvenate myself / stabilize my state of mind, it would all lash out and unleash in a way I wouldn't want it too. Stability is the key for me. I like to be on top of things, and feeling normal and refreshed.   Tomorrow I am finally off for a day. I have to mow the lawn though. Which won't be that bad, all I will do is throw my headphones on and cut away. Music is relaxing and soothing.   I honestly listen to music WHENEVER I have the chance. I find myself even putting televison on closed captioning to listen to a song. It makes me feel so good and relaxed. Music is truly, pleasurable to the mind and soul.  Work was pretty busy today, for a Saturday anyway. We went in and out of queue for the day, so it was busy for awhile, then dead for awhile, then busy etc. It was like a pattern of calls. Now that I can handle, because it wasn't bombarded with people waiting on hold, I think the highest we had today was 9. That is nothing compared to the time we had 77 people waiting on hold to get through to us. And because we were understaffed that day it kept building, it seemed like for every 1 call we took, 3 more called in. We couldn't win that night.   Anyways, that's the updates as of today. I start my holidays on Wednesday, so I will be having more interesting experiences to type on here..:)   A Sad State  Saddened by the heart, Careless to the touch, Succession is the key, Knowing, is too much.  A gateway to the concept, The key unlocks the stipulation, Life to one, and it's own, To me is a mere revelation.  Irony and bliss are present, Duties and respect are gone, Followers withhold pretense, Nobody exists but pawns  Dystopian realms of what? Full of judgementals and fakes, To change the worlds ridiculing ways, I would do whatever the hell it takes.   Saddened and mortified by this place, Grief exists, and contentness is overrated, We all live in the dark, and we Know nothing; we are shaded.
