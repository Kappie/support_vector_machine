However, I would now like to give the impression that I am right royally narked off.  Sam has been oh-so-clever in realising that she knows Lizzie *feigns shock*. She has also been oh-so-clever in telling me that Lizzie is going out with a 6th former; an eventuality it must be pointed out that I WAS THERE FOR. What was really strange was remembering every detail of the conversation we had on the way back to the bus in Brugge on the Tuesday... We left the teddy bear shop (oh-so-cool) and I talked to her and was generally boring but never mind. Sam is in general narking me off. Never mind the other reasons, because I'm not going to say them to anyone other than Scott and to be COMPLETELY honest I doubt anyone else would keep their mouths shut.  Mr. Cowley (brilliant bloke and great trombonist) has advised that I audition for GYO next year. He says it would be useful for practical, but certainly not any kind of entertainment, reasons. GYO has large-scale pieces that I would be unlikely to find at any other of the youth orchestras scattered around the county. So... Digby, I'll be there in due course. The ever-complimentary Phil also advised that I should go for GYJO in the passage of time... what with a severe lack of Jazz playing this may, however, cause a minor problem.  My English coursework on action sequences from Bond films gained me a B+; this means my Original Writing work will have to be something special in order to pull my grade back up by the scruff of its neck. Excuse me while I say bugger about this. I would have adored the ability to not work myself to death on the Original Writing.  Haven't seen Caroline yet... didn't see her this morning, possibility exists that she'll be at CYB but on recent appearances it might be deemed unlikely. If I knew her any better (or if she wasn't going out with Tim Daley) I might consider 'going after' Lizzie, but I believe it would, even in that circumstance, prove fruitless. I disturbed her too much. I hate saying 'go after' people but it's the closest phrase to what I mean.  I have been given yet MORE tablets by the doctor; they are anti-biotics, once again. They look less intimidating, and have a much nicer flavour. However, they feel like they're knocking you out. I'm on them for a week. Jeremiah. I don't like anti-biotics. Well, I don't like being ill, but that's really a given, I would believe.  I have been found today using many keyboard things, such as using the set drum beats and playing in the chords. Ever-so-slightly beneath my ability as a pianist but it sounded good. Alright, feeling a little under-challenged by it, but still, I don't mind too much, sometimes it's nice to be under-challenged.  I STILL have not recieved this fucking cheque. It is bloody annoying. I need the Â£60. ARGH.  I've been posting this for around half an hour... I believe I put more effort into this than most people. It's like writing an essay about my life. "The alliteration in this sentence shows that I was bloody narked off."  Quote of the day: "Between the dark and the daylight, When the dark is beginning to lower, Comes a pause in the day's occupations, That is known as the Children's hour."  From Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's   Children's Hour   Love, Jon Roskilly
