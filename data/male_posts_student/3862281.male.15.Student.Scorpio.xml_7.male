This rarely does little for me other than allow me to put thoughts in order and perhaps draw lines between knowledge to understand things more.  One thing has come to me recently though, a small thought that is certainly true for myself and maybe true for others.   Emotions are like energy.  In the way that as an object gains energy, the object looks for ways to release that energy (e.g. heat, movement and in excess amounts of energy, explosion). It's in this way that the mind does the same thing with emotion. As a person experiences emotion they must find outlets for it. For example, as a person feels angry they must unleash that anger in some way (e.g. hurting somebody).  However certain emotions seem easier to release than others. Like happiness, all that is needed is to laugh, transfer of energy/emotion can be seen in happiness too for when you see one person laugh you often see others join in.  Emotions can be released in many forms too but each emotion seems to have it's own signature outlets, love for instance can be outletted by kissing, hugging, making love, etc, whereas anger is usually outletted by shouting, giving pain, etc.  Unfortunately, as with energy, as more emotions are experienced or kept contained then more outlets are needed until eventually so much emotion/energy is stored that a mental disastor occurs, fortunately I haven't experienced this and the metaphorical equivalent to an energy induced explosion might be different in the emotional terms, for instance, it might be something along the lines of self destruction therefore something like suicide?  Is this true for you? It would interest me to find out if this 'theory' applies to others than myself.  What are my emotional outlets? Video games, I release my emotions in imaginary worlds on imaginary people because the only real person I could freely express emotion towards has died and now I hide myself from the world behind warped versions of reality. But I fear this isn't enough,I'vefelt my mental condition declining for some time now, I'm afraid this is because I have to much pent up emotion that I can no longer express how I used to.Will I some day face the destruction that my theory predicts? What does this 'destruction' involve? Can I avoid it? Where can I find other outlets?  I've had answers to these questions but none were welcome, I'm travellingalong the road to a better life but for now I'm lost and need to find a new route.
