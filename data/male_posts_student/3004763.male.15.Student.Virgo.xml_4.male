Well I think that it's bull I could really care less about going to branso again there is nothing new the only thimg I wanna do is ride the go-karts. and buy a new knife the only thing this does is it makes me have to stay at school caue i wanted to leave early cause I dont want to see the talent show cause it's a hella fun( for u dumb asses i was being sarcastic). I went back to the YMCA today and went to my favorite class and I can finally jog.  I couldn't jog or run because I broke my toes from riden a motorcycle. I'm thinkin I'm gonna skip and go home and get yelled at for skiping.
