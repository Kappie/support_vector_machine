The darkening clouds are bringing rain and a dreamy smile to me, and my window candles are gently dancing in anticipation. Does it not calm you, yet stir up a natural excitement? One could simply nap, or make love to the growl of thunder, and the wind in the trees, but they'll be gone far too soon, for I could be one with this storm all day long.....
