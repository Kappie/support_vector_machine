I when like “huh, did I?” So she repeats the question again, and I replied “nope” And she asked if I’m Daniel Tan, well of cause I said no. What’s up with my phone number man? So many wrong callers calling in and this last call was just so funny. The caller got my surname alright, just that I’m not called Daniel. Wonder what did that lucky guy won, Hehehe~
