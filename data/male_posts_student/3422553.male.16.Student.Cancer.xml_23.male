Went bowling with friends Tuesday, starting going out with my hobo, aka LBH aka B-Hines aka Cowgirl aka scubba gooba etc.  Thursday da bunny and Jeremy came by and we had some fun.  Playing some basketball and chillin' at the grip.  It was a lot of fun.  Then Friday I went to da bunny/Emily's farewell party and that was pretty cool.  Playing Halo at an event, can't get much better.  It was quite fun.  Then today I went up to Springdale because my parents are crazy and wanted to go up there.  So I went up there and while there read a magazine I bought about the upcoming NFL football year.  I'm ready for my fantasy football draft I think.  Got a greatest hits of the Beatles because I don't own one.  So listened to that and read my magazine pretty much.  Found a Dairy Queen too been looking for one of those because I see their commercials all the time when I watch da sox games on my laptop.  Got myself a coffee drink and mmm...mmm good stuff.  Well, I get my schedule Wednesday so I suppose I'll post that.  I'm out!
