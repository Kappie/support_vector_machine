I think that I might continue and write reviews on some of the newer CDs I have.  There's really no sense in writing reviews on the older stuff.  It's not likely anyone would look at it.  Nonetheless, if they were bored maybe.  I don't know we'll see.  Today at conditioning (yesterday really), we were all through the stations and we were on our last running activity.  I was sure to grab a swig of Frost Gatorade before that.  I don't like the feeling of a dry mouth and the little burst of sugar from it would be nice.  So I started to drink some and I guess I just had a bit too much.  We started our 'indian run' around the track.  It went fine for almost two laps right before I had to sprint to the front then set the pace.  I was on my way to the front when the person in front of me was slowing down.  I kept at his pace for a while then decided I was wasting energy.  I just went around to pass him until I got to the front.  That's when the Gatorade felt a little weird.  Within seconds of me finally getting to the front, I had to pull over and take a pit stop at the nearest grassy area.  Immediatly I went face down into the grass throwing up my Gatorade.  It came in three flows of blue Gatorade along with the acid in my stomach.  After the third flow of blue spew, I felt much better.  I'm sorry if that story made you sick.  It's time for me to go to bed now.  I have to lift in the morning.  Good night.
