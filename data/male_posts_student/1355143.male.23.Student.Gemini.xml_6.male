The vast majority of the time my life goes smoothly along here at home, but a few times a day I get caught up thinking about Barcelona. The smallest thing often triggers it. Maybe I'll catch myself telling someone what Adam, Ulli, or Beatrice would say in a certain situation, or I'll think of looking out on the Mediterranean from the oh so conveniently perched Residencia. But regardless of what triggers thoughts of Barcelona, one thing is always the same...it never feels like I was actually there. All of my friends seem like very vivid characters from a movie, and if I can just think hard enough I know I'll remember the name of the movie. All of our stories seem like something I made up to amuse myself, like some delusional schizophrenic with a penchant for booze and late night clubbing. But when I stop and think, all of the best experiences in life seem surreal as they gradually fade, not entirely from the memory, but back into the corners of the mind from whence they emerge when summoned. And so, I thank each one of you for making my experience a little bit more surreal.  Tim
