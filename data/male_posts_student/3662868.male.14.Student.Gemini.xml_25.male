I was replicating some of it. I still can't promise that there won't be strange posts. Hey, at least it was fun to read and think about and try to read through the pop over. Smart people would have viewed the source code. Anyways, I'm single again. Kinda sucks.       Raindrops hitting the window. Drip. Drip. Like blood from a knife.
