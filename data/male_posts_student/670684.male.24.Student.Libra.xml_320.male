Lotto, Texas was not accepted into the film festival, and thus I want very little to do with the organization this year.  Last year I volunteered, driving filmmakers to and from the airport, selling tickets at venues, and doing other mechanical happenings that they needed accomplished.  It was kind of fun...probably the most poorly run film festival I've known, but the films were shown and people enjoyed them.    I watched a few as well.  And I wasn't at all impressed.  Yes, they were better than  urlLink Clubbing , but I'd expect anything shot by a UT student with a working knowledge of film production to wax the floor with my senior film created by a guy whose previous experience with film production was holding a camera.  The films were alright, but many of the messages weren't strong, and a lot of the sound was awful.   Of the films created in Zander's Digital Doc class last year, only  Hump  got the call by CT.  Hump's a fine film...the funniest of the group, and possibly the most polished.  There's a moment in the film that will fill the theatre with laughter.    But I'm jealous.  I really hope that this year CT shows much better films than they did last year, or I'll really wonder how Lotto, Texas didn't make the cut.  I haven't seen it since May, but looking back on what we ended up with, I don't think it sucked.
