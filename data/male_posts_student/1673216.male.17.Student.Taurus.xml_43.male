Because, that's where all my summers are....AHA! Thought of one. So we went on the trip with two other groups, one from Minnetonka, and one from Seattle. Now, the Seattle group was composed of Jr. High kids. The Minnetonka one, of seniors. Now, being that the Seattle kids were...Jr. High kids, we -could- have given them a break, but no, they didn't deserve it. For example, one hotel we stayed at was very very nice. You entered the giant wooden French doors, and step in on the marble ground to see a giant lobby, with a comfortable "phone" room off to the left, and three marble steps leading up to the giant receptions desk. There were several comfortable chairs with a medium sized oak coffee table, scattered with phone books, maps of the city, and brocheres for various bussinesses that rented bikes for the day, and other things to do in the city. The receptions desk was positioned in the center of the spiral staircase, so after you dragged your bags up the marble stairs or squeezed into the tiny elevater with 8 other lazy people, you could look right down the staircase and see the desk from a bird's-eye view. This is a pretty large spiral staircase, too, probably 15 feet across. So one night, before check in time actually, the Jr. High kids grab a broom....Now, I don't know what motivated them, but they threw it...Straight down the middle of the staircase...For no reason... It crashed on the desk, scattering papers everywhere. WHAT THE HELL? Ok, ... I don't know why...Wouldn't the thought of that make you angry?! Yeah! Yep. That's a story, I got's a ton of em =D. Too bad no one will read it...Hmm... If someone tells me too, I'll write more stories.
