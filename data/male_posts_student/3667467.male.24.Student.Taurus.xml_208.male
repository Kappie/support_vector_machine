Harrison (2), Johnson (2), Roosevelt (2), Bush (2), Adams (2), Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Jackson, Fillmore, Polk, Arthur, Lincoln, Pierce, Cleveland (counts twice, non-consecutive terms), Van Buren, Garfield, McKinley, Kennedy, Taft, Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Truman, Eisenhower, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, Grant, Hayes…uhh, Letterman, Shaffer and, uh, Schrock. Nuts, I was THIS close….Stupid 19th century.  N.B. Missed: Tyler, Taylor, Buchanan
