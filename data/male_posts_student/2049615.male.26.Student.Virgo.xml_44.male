You would also have been misled into believing that this post is about the  urlLink hal al-Shedad  in any more than an oblique fashion.  It is in fact partly autobiographical, and partly about Unwound.  Lately I have been listening to  urlLink Unwound  a lot, in particular their last album,  Leaves Turn Inside You .  It's a really atmospheric album - it's suffused with a stillness or coldness that other Unwound albums lack.  Someone please review my other posts and let me know if I overuse the word "suffused".  I realized, or decided, or it occurred to me, that it would make for ideal beach listening, with the caveat that the beach is on Lake Superior and it's after October 7th.  Because I enjoy feeling miserable, I think it would be a ripping good time to listen to the album, lying in the scrub, staring alternately up at the grey sky and across at the grey waves and pining.  As soon as I had this thought, I realized that I don't really have anyone to pine over at present, and so I'm kind of screwed.  The most "on point" of you are noticing that this is what the hal al-Shedad reference in the title relates to.  The rest of you are going to have to resign yourselves to ignorance, because I believe, as I hope you do, that quoting emotional hardcore lyrics in a blog when you're not explicitly discussing them is the height of  gaucherie .  Yes I'm making up words in French now.  For most of what I guess I have to consider my "adult" life, I've been making myself miserable over this or that girl, but since getting over it the last time about ten months ago I haven't really latched on to a new source;  I believe that my enjoyment of music has suffered for it.  There's something about being 25 and miserable that really spices up quality rock music.  Not everything benefits from the self-pity factor.  It really works for the last Unwound album.  Early Modest Mouse.  Sebadoh.  My Bloody Valentine.  Other stuff, not really.  Self-pity doesn't add much to "Rock With You", for example.  Regular old self-pity doesn't seem to help the listening experience, unfortunately.  I have that in spades.  Your thesis going nowhere doesn't make "You Never Should" any more poignant.  Your thesis going nowhere is really more of a Converge-friendly kind of self-pity.  No, romantically-based self-pity is the No. 4 heroin of self-pities, because it's uncontaminated by fear and heavily laced with base longing.  Therefore I would like to end this post with an appeal:  If you are a woman between the ages of 22 and 29, who wouldn't mind toying with my affections for a few months, send me a message.  Geographic distance is not a problem, and it really doesn't matter if you already have a boyfriend.  My record collecton and I thank you in advance.  Holy shit I am a whiny fuck.  I am such a whiny fuck, in fact, that I only added that last bit so people would comment in, reassuring me that I am not really that whiny of a fuck.  So let's hear it, people.
