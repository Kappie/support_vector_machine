But even if this is a site operated by kooks for kooks, I'm still troubled by what I've seen of the Face.  The high resolution photos still leave a lot of questions unanswered, but I'm not willing to take the Enterprise stance that NASA under orders from the NSA has doctored the images.    The Face is still a pretty strange structure, and those arguing that it is nothing but a mesa have not quite answered all of the lingering questions.    Anyway, the site provides some entertainment, especially when it contends that Spirit is sitting on a field strewn with metal artifacts.  Maybe it's seeing a failed Russian lander.
