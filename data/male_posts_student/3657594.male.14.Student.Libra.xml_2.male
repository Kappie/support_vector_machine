Dogs are man's best friend, and its only natural that the dog is a secret spy trying to catch that wife doing the dirty with Mr the mailman.  Mailmen often are skinny and wear white uniforms which make them look to the dog like big bones with legs, and dogs love to chew on bones.  Most mailmen are relatively poor and probably don't always wash, and dogs have very sensitive smell.  How do you eliminate a foul odour, easy, you claw it to death!  Finally, mailmen are mostly social rejects, and the dog knows you don't like it when there's trash on your lawn.  So there you have it, the truth is that mailman maulings are just a way of catching your wife, having a snack, eliminating foul odours, or keeping garbadge of the lawn.
