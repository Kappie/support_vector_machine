(GOsh that made me sound so lame).. at least that's what I think.. we've all done things that we've regret and hope we've never done before and wish that we could turn back time to set everything straight again, TIME TRAVEL.. but, we were being naive, I realised making mistakes is one of the factors in shaping one's personality.. Ha.. Ha.. (sarcastically) ya, that's true.. although it sucks to hear the truth, it is the truth :/ anyway, what is done is done.. there's no turning back.. as said in Ashton Kutcher's The Butterfly Effect... but we can do something about it.. by preventing ourselves from doing things that we would regret.. I know I CAN'T do it, u KNOW urself.. people make mistakes all their lives.. well, at least that's what we've or I've been practically trying to do for LiFe..!  Started studying for my math..WOOHoOO!! LoL.. and guess what!? had some help from the geekiest and nerdiest, WOoPz!! I meant the coolest and smartest kid around the block.. no other than Gordon Ho! *grins* Haha.. yUpz.. helped me in logarithms and indices.. that really sucked, those Operators and Exponentiations can really call in for a headache! dun even get me started on Trigonometry!! well.. tomorrow I'll b heading to the library to put into use the other 5 % of my brain which is dormant btw..! :/ GoSh.. that is if my friends are reluctant or willingly enough to drive me there.. damn it's late.. ARGH! I can't wait to finish my homework at the library tomorrow! well, that is IF my brain is following :/ *YaWnZ* Nitez! ciao..
