This new feature (which could, and probably should go on bagel.tech, but, I want it here instead), will show you some of the most...interesting auctions I have seen on eBay.  Normally, I'll post one from the "Totally Bizarre" category, one from the "Videogames" category, one from the "DVD and Movies" category, and then something else.  I'm going to only do this once a week, since I feel like I'm going to be overdoing some of the features that I'm doing.    Now, on to tonight's eBay auctions.  We'll start with the "Totally Bizarre" one, which...is, really...totally bizarre.  Here we go.   Totally Bizarre: Design your own Diploma  Link:  urlLink Click Here!   This one is weird because you can make your own college or University diploma, right from your own computer.  Yeah, its the easy way to say you graduated from college.  This isn't the most bizarre thing I've seen, but...wait until next time.  As of press time, there is about 9 days and 22 hours left on this auction.    Videogames: Playstation 1 with Memory Cards and Stuff  Link:  urlLink Click here!  This one is cool because at a starting price of $26.95, you can get a PSone console, 3 games, and a memory card.  If you're looking for a PSone, this is the best deal, in my opinion.   DVDs and Movies: Family Guy DVD Set: All 50 Episodes  Link:  urlLink Click here.  I like this one because its Family Guy.  The second greatest cartoon on the face of this planet, and if I was allowed to, I would buy it in a heartbeat.  It contains all 50 episodes of the show, which is awesome.  Well, that's it for this edition of eBay Hunter.  Next time, I'll have a funny auction from the bizarre section, one you're never going to forget!  Until then, check out Late Night Bloggin', later on tonight.
