So, without further ado... my new screenname is: heartsrocK3  Can you find the secret message? clever, eh? I thought so. What? You didn't find it? Look harder =\.  Actually, I didn't notice the cool secret message until Britt told me, but let's keep that on the dl.  I got to play meh favorite game today!  Today, Rick James died. I didn't know who Rick James was until about twenty minutes ago when I looked him up online. It seems he was a popular musician. RIP Rick James, and let's hope that "I'm Rick James, Bitch!" line goes with him. I almost used one of his lyrics for today's posts, and then I told myself not to waste my time :).  I was planning to go to Bri's show tonight, but I postponed it until tomorrow. My mom got an MRI done, and in the simplest words possible, a spinal disc is pushing against her nerve. The scientific name for it is 'A Bulging disc.'  Kristin left for Jupiter, Florida today :(. I haven't seen her all summer, but I'm just realizing it now :(. I miss you Kristin! I'm planning on taping the Michael Jackson movie for her, but if I forget I'm not going to worry because I'm betting she has three VCRs ready to tape every second of it.  Way away, away from here I'll be.  (This is the first post for the scavenger hunt, see if you can keep up.)  Yellowcard - Way Away  *continued* Check my next post for more info.  I think I'm breaking out I'm going to leave you now Theres nothing for me here, it's all the same And even though I know That everything might go Go downhill from here, I'm not afraid  Way away away from here I'll be Way away away so you can see How it feels to be alone and not believe (Feels to be alone and not believe) Feels to be alone and not believe anything  You can't stop me now You can't hold me down You can't keep me here, I'm on my way I've made it this far now And I'm not burning out No matter what you say, I'm not afraid  Way away away from here I'll be Way away away so you can see How it feels to be alone and not believe (Feels to be alone and not believe) Feels to be alone and not believe anything  Letting out the noise inside of me (Letting out the noise inside of me) Every window pane is shattering (Every window pane is shattering) Cutting off my words before I speak (Cutting off my words) This is how it feels to not believe  Letting out the noise inside of me (Letting out the noise inside of me) Every window pane is shattering (Every window pane is shattering) Cutting off my words before I speak (Cutting off my words) This is how it feels to not believe  Way away away from here I'll be Way away away so you can see How it feels to be alone and not believe (feels to be alone and not believe) Feels to be alone and not believe anything  Hmm. He doesn't believe. Literally the song is about rebellion. It seems to me as though the person has decided he's fed up with the rules. 'Way away, away from here I'll be' can go two ways; either he's secluding himself from the rest of the world, or he means it literally, and he's running away. I do agree the latter seems like the best explanation, but the third verse gives the picture that he's risen up and is voicing his opinion. The song gives the idea that he's screaming, but it could also mean he's using a great argument. He's letting out what's been bottled inside. The second through fourth lines tell us his attempts were futile; he failed. He no longer has a window into their head maybe? They finally cut him off, they don't believe.  What's the song trying to tell us? I think the main theme of this song is 'unfairness.' Sometimes you just can't get people to agree with you, and sometimes you can't change people, and even if this is true you need to voice your opinion because that's all anybody can do: voice their opinion.
