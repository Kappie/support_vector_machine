Something about these Blogs makes me wonder if there won't be a new type of archaeology created to sift through the layers of rock and sediment that currently permeate the net in order to trace 'cultural change' via these things. Can you imagine that Blogs may form an information resource for future generations to judge this current one?  *shudders at the thought*  Anyway, I got hit last night with the full realisation that yes, I will indeed be leaving University come October, and yes, the real world will be hard. Funny how one grows used to this bubble that is so protective; a microcosm is what this campus is.  All in all, the transition should be fine; it's just the usual niggly worries. The money, the moving, the getting a job. All the stress involved with the uncertainty of it all that will, in time, be replaced by the monotony of it all, I suppose.  You know that  'I wonder what I'll be doing five years from now'  syndrome? Well, it's got me in its grip at the moment.
