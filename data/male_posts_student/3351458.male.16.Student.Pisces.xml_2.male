And I won't care who the hell reads my blog and I won't care if no one reads my blog at all. Today, for some reason or the other, one thing has been bothering me. A LOT! The connection between Malaysians and English, is a terrible one. I'm not criticizing all Malaysians here, but these past few weeks, I've come to realize a fact. All Malaysians are really "stuck-up" and they are even more so if they have a fair command of English. I'm not accusing all Malaysians of being so, but it is true. Just because a person can speak proper English, he or she will look down on others like the other person is not worthy of living in the same world as him or herself.  Hell, I don't know where I got the inspiration for this blog entry. Just came into my mind, and bang, I start writing! It is a sad reality (to quote the debate teacher of mine).  Speaking of debates, I don't really know if I really enjoy it. Just read a blog of one of my best friends who said something about passion and what not. No disrespect here, but I sincerely do not gain anything from putting myself through this endless torture. I'll be the first to admit, I love skipping classes. I love sneaking off to play games whenever teacher gets out of the library. I like hanging out with my "bestest" friends all day doing virtually nothing but talk crap. And I guess the best thing of all is to win... But, then again, I feel stupid and silly. I'm a virtual unknown in the team. Not that I care, but I just feel left out. It is real crappy. It also ain't very pleasing when I feel like I'm a damn liability to the team. This is stupid. Whoever came up with the rule that at least one bumiputra speaker must be in a debate team is an idiot. Heh, for once I feel glad I have a blog to just let go of some stuff I probably won't in real life...
