All i want is to have him stay one way or the other really, then i would know what was going on for sure.  i would give up about anything if he would always be his happy self just wanting to go do stuff with me all the time and actually being able to.  About every thrid day by noon on that day he is just different.  when he is like this, one day i can be talkin to him and we talk about going to do something the next day and were gonna go do it but then he goes to sleep and acts different b/c apparently he is depressed again.  i dont even know if it is depression but whatever it is, it blows and i wish i could get rid of it.  all it does it stress my mom out and frustrate me.  today alone besides when i saw him right after i woke up, all he has been doing is falling asleep and slurin words and stuff.  And if hes like that when my friends are over my mom just takes him to the back room and he just chills there so she wont be embarrased.  o well.  sorry about last night folks... yeah..
