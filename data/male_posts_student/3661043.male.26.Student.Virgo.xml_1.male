My weight is constantly fluctuating up and down and when it's on the down end which is very common right now, I hurt all over and my body is very tired. Due to this condition it has taken me several years to get through school. I had to take time off for surgeries and drop classes due to the fact that I could not get out of bed. Lately I have been dealing with the pain better and able to attend my classes more regularly but I feel like some think that I am using this disease as a crutch. If I had the choice, sitting around the house in pain shitting my guts out would not be the way I would choose to spend my life... I am not looking for sympathy and I hardly ever discuss my disease, but I feel that people who don't understand it think I am faking or not putting forth all my effort. Well how would you be doing if you drop 20lbs lost a couple feet of your intestine and had to walk around in chronic pain everyday?
