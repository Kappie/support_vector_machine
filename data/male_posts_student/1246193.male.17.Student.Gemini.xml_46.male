I see it is home calling and I answer it.  Instead of recieving the usual, "What are you doing, will you go to Dairy Queen", I hear this horrible high pitched wailing.  So loud that everyone looks at me and they turn the movie off.  Being the worry-wort that I am I instantly assume somebody is dead.  I run through who it could be in my mind, mom, dad, grandma, grandpa.  The only people that I care about and then she says my ankle hurts.  She sprained it quite badly although she is dramatic.  I am sure none of you really cared about the story as it was very boring and pointless, like most of my stories, I have a tendency to go off on tangents, anyway I had nothing to blog about.  I am so excited, school starts in less than two weeks! I think tangents are an interesting way to make conversations flow from one topic to another.
