A warning word has come forth in the past week, and that is the enemies camp there is unrest and a new attack on the body has been launched.God spoke the word to me in a dream, "Seducing Spirits."  In the dreams were the leaders of the body and how the enemy is trying to infiltrate the front line.  There is now a group of us now interceding for those leaders on the front line. It is no surprise to me that the enemy will try a stunt like this, but my friend, it will be to no avail!!!  Why??? Because there is a stirring, a Holy Stirring that Only God could have started.  So, pray for the front line leaders of the body, pray God's covering, protection and wisdom and discernment in these last days!!!   --Alex
