WELL. I HAVE MESSAGES FOR THE THREE GAY LARDS OF THIS COUNTY.   ronnie - you're a fucking liar.. and FUCKING UGLY. did you really think we'd believe that you got fucked in the back of a pt cruiser at delavega golf course? NOPE. try to make up lies we'll actually believe. like you joined the circus.  ----> hey, i'd believe it!  and you know what! i'm happy you and jaye got together. it is a match made it HEAVEN! now we don't have two ugly fat guys roaming around, falling in love with the cuties and making death threats to the hot guys who the cute ones fall in love with. bless you, mini man.    jaye - what is there to even SAY about you? you're such a fuck up, omg. you don't even give people a chance to explain themselves, and you DEFINETLY DON'T try to talk things out. i pity the ugly ass dickshit who gets stuck with you. unless it's ronnie. you know, i tried to be nice, and i tried to be friendly. i complimented you like crazy, kissed ass, and tried to boost your self esteem so you didn't go all whack and shoot yourself, which we all would've benefitted from anyway.  what more you do you want!?  the next time you're lying in bed, crying yourself to sleep because you weigh more than an elephant and look like a tomato and eggs omelette, remember me, because i was the only hot gay guy you'll ever meet who'll treat you with decency and respect. GOD YOU ARE LIKE THAT FATSO IN SE7EN!!! OMG!! THAT'S TOTALLY YOU!! WOAH!!! YOu'RE LIKE THE GOODYEAR BLIMP!! ARE YOU GONNA HOVER OVER THE CABRILLO STADIUM!!??   and last, to my dear lover  jack - what do you want me to say? i wish we didn't have to fight.. because i really did care about you. but you know what, when you TRY to cheat on brandon, you get fucking yelled at. don't use the fact that i cheated on you during our relationship, because you TRIED to cheat on me, and that's almost, if not just as bad as, CHEATING. JSUT BECAUSE You"RE TOO FUCKING HAIRY AND FAT TO GET ATTENTION FROM ANYONE DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BITCH TO ME ABOUT IT! :-D!!  i have been so open-minded and understanding, and i have forgiven you for sooo many things. SO MANY THINGS. when we first started getting to know each other, you sold out my words to RC and made him think i was a fucking pyscho. DID I EVER THANK YOU FOR THAT? oh well, RC's cool and over it, and you're a fattie.. so it doesn't matter.  then you would pass your phone around at break whenever i would call you because you'd want your friends to lie and say you were in the bathroom so you wouldn't have to talk from me.  HEY, YOU EVEN TOLD MY COUSIN THAT IF WE EVER WENT OUT, YOU'D PLAY ME LIKE THE UNDERCLASSMEN I AM!! AND YOU KNOW WHAT, I CALLED MY COUSIN A FUCKING LAIR BECAUSE I BELIEVED YOU WHEN YOU SAID YOU WOUDLNT!!! STUPID ASS ME. I SHOULD'VE SHOT MYSELF!!!  then i yelled at you and avoided you, and you know what, i'll admit that i was ugly, and if i were you, i'd i've avoided me too! so i can't really blame you for that.  but then you "fell in love with me" and who knows, maybe you did, or maybe you were just sweet talking me so i would blow you because oyu found out that i gave great head (since i DID get with a 20 year old). you acted like a jealous little bitch when i would hang out with jaye, and you gave me funny looks when i didn't say goodbye to you at harbor. was that LOVE or just DISAPPIONTMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE AS FAT AS CHINA!?  then we DID go out! and i must say, i had a lot of fun with you! especially when you'd tell your friends and everyone who knew we were oging out that you didn't think our relationship was going anywhere. AND THEN YOU'D TURN AROUND AND TELL ME YOU LOVED ME AND WANTED TO BE WITH ME FOREVER!! WEIRD, HUH?  but then i got sick of you, since we only hung out THREE times in our almost two months of dating. WHAT A LOSER. and RIGHT after i dumped you, you turned to jaye and started playing with his ding dong and trying to kiss him.  when the three of us hung out that crazy saturday in may, and then we walked back to your car and i gave you head and you told me you wanted to lose your virginity to me, i was stupid, i guess. because i believe you. BUT THEN THE NEXT WEEK WHEN NATHALIE AND HOT HOT TINA AND I WENT TO GO SEE THE SOQUEL MUSICAL, you told me you couldn;'t come because you were sick.  BUT WHAT DID YOU DO? YOU WENT AND GAVE HEAD TO JAYE IN THE BACKSEAT OF A CAR BEING DRIVEN BY LESBOS!! OOO!! THAT SOUNDS HOT!! no.  and then the next day, you had the nerve to tell me you loved me. only me. and that you wanted to go out with me. pretty fickle, huh?  then you yelled at me because you were with tori, the chick who doesn't know youre gay. EVEN THOUGH JUST YOUR FUCKING BEST FRIEND. but i guess that little conversation we had where you told me you wanted to marry her and grow old with her meant that telling ehr you were gay would ruin your LIFE PLAN.  speaking on coversations, you would butter me up and tell me you missed me, and then you would go hang out with jaye at the mall. (I'M LIKE FUCKING GOD, DON'T TRY TO DO ANYHTING AND THINK THAT I WON'T FGURE IT OUT SOONER OR LATER. FATSO.)  i'm sorry, i should laugh off the fact that you're humongus and disgusting. and have really hairy feet. i mean, you can't help that! oh wait.. ;-)  you told me when summer happened we'd be together and again and we'd saee each other ALL THE TIME. BUT IT'S AUGUST AND YOU HAVEN'T FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH ANY OF YOUR PLANS!! LOSER!!  and you know what, i gave you the benfit of the doubt when alex told me that you asked him for sexual favors on your BIRTHDAY! YOUR BIRTHDAY!!!!! you said you were going to SF with your parents on your birthday!! AND I BOUGHT YOU A LONG STEMMED ROSE AND BROUGHT IT ALL THE WAY TO HARBOR FOR YOU!! AND YOU WENT BEHIND MY BACK!!  no.. i can't even act suprised. it seems like trying to get other boys to fuck you is typical. maybe it's because you have a psycho alcoholic father and a waspy mom who covers up her problems with money. and don't even get me started on your sister.  but please, i digrese. it's not your fault you have a sucky family. and that you have to cover up the fact that you're gay whenever you're with them. YOU KNOW WHAT JACK! you should just say "I'm GAY AND ACCEPT THAT OR FUCK YOU!"  and then you try to get me to hang out with you ONLY AFTER everyone else cancels on you and no one wants to be seen with you.  you even asked daniel vivani to go MAKE OUT WITH YOU. FUCK HEAD!! YOU DON'T DO THAT SHIT!!! at least i was honest when i told you i cared about you.  i've said it before, and i'll say it again. just because i'm actually hot enough to get with another guy doesn't mean you have to yell at me for cheating on you when you would've done the same in a heart beat. AND A LITTLE ADVICE SWEETIE: STAY AWAY FROM SHORTS!! yeah! hairy ass.  i actually believed you when you told me you loved me, but i guess that's my fault, huh? what a loser i am. so jack, what i wanan say to you is: EXERCISE. FUCK YOUR STRAIGHT CHICK.  AND GO SHAVE YOUR FUCKING BACK HAIR!  i guess i should thank you for the lessons you've given me. and trust me,  i know now to cut the  FAT  out of my  DIET .
