I think I've done quite well with it, just gotta smooth off the edges in Goldwave, then I'm done.  Had the Cross Country on tuesday, that really sucked, 3 miles, 35 mins running, I came 28th though, out of 125 people in my year, *proud*  Shemnue's getting better, gunna have the 70 man battle any day soon. So, "I'm a Celebrity.." ended a few days ago, now who couldn't see that Kerry was gunna win? It's all this follow up stuff on what the celebrities "really" thought about each other that annoys me. Can't they just let the show end. Meh.  And, tomorrow is the last day before the half term! Yay! and it's Conner's birthday thing on monday, so that'll be fun, and I think I'm going out tuesday aswell to Croyon.. wait.. yeh, I am. So that'll be fun. I'm pretty sure I'm meant to be going other places.. but I can't remember right now, I think I'll get a cup of tea then it'll come to me....
