Pirated music CDs, movies, games for all platforms, BB pellet guns and even stolen hand phones. Of course, I spotted a KFC restaurant, so I decided to go in. Based on earlier experiences, I knew that KFC was not the place to have lunch in...but oh well, I still went in. As I stepped in, I noticed that behind the 4 cashiers there were huge lines, so I stepped into one. After waiting for about 20 minutes, I finally got to order.   "1 O.R. Burger and a large coke...with NO ICE!"  The response to this was "do yu want to wait 5 minutes for the burger? I said, screw this and went off. KFC SUCKS!
