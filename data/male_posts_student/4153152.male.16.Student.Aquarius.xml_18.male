The movie itself is awesome, and it really helped me learn a little more about movie making. However, the special features on this thing just blow me away. There's a part on the 2nd disc where they show raw footage from different cameras, and that has been a major help. The camera angles and setup are just impeccable, and I'm learning from that. Already I'm getting ideas for sequences.  I'm going to try and setup a small movie LAN tomorrow, just for prelim footage and some brainstorming ideas. I want to find a map that suits what we are doing well, so we can get a large amount of footage shot without having to change gears. It should work out well, and then we can do the full shots in two or three more sessions. I'm pretty excited about the whole thing.  I found some awesome fonts and an excellent color of orange at the same time. The two combined and compelled me to make some intro setups. This is the main title screen:  urlLink    The orange comes across better in a .gif file.  It's jokey but I like it. I will probably retool it some to make it more professional sometime in the future. I'll keep you updated.
