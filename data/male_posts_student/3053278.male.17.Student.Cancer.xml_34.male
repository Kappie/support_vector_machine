And I'll never get my classification cause Inever get more than 10 guys at a tournement. And I have to get to Tracey. He's the only person I really want. I have to have my shot at him. It seems to me the only real fencers standing in my way areHammond and Kopylov, I know there weakpoints, I just need to be in the right state of mind to fence them. I know many of there faults.I'm trying to track down the list of top rated fencers who are still in high school I will find them all and beat them, get myself on that list.
