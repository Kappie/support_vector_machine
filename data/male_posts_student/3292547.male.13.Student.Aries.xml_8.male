To go back through and sum everything that's happened in the last few days would be a very long.... very many- posts. So I'll only skim over to top. You're just going to get "the icing on the cake" Maybe even just the icing of the icing on the cake; if there is such a thing.  On Sunday I got to control PowerPoint during the church service, htough the preaching outline didn't work, I did get to do the songs. We also ordered a computer for me today. What started as just a boost in RAM has turned out to be a completly new computer, so once I get it, I can tell you you'll see one of 2 things: I'm going to not post at all until I'm done and give you an overview of what I did each day on it until that day  I'm going to post each day what I've done on my computer  I'm going to send you a premade list before I do it  As much as I'm going to love it, I'm going to have to reinstall every program onto my new hard drive. Then go in and copy what settings and file I find useful over; go back in and copy all pictures, documents, etc.; format the old hard drive; set it up as a "slave/secondary" drive and recopy all my pictures and so forth back over to it.  By the time it's all said and done, I'll have 2 hard drives. A 40GB (new) one that will have all the main stuff, and a 20GB (old) hard drive that will have pictures and other stuff of the likes on it. To Be Continued
