This morning, since i had nothing better to do, i decided to take in a few rounds.  The verdict: i ruled!  I play on the  urlLink WKA clan server , which has some pretty hardcore players on it.  The map then was dod_flash, and considering, thats my favourite map in the whole game.  My score was 31 for 29.  Pretty good... i kept my head above water.    Then, i went back in about 30 mins ago.  The verdict: i completely sucked. The map was dod_chemille... one of the worst maps possible in the game.  My final score was about 14 for 27.... not good at all.  I sunk.   The WKA clannies are all pretty cool, they all voice chat all the time.  I just enjoy listening to them talk.  I someday hope to be in WKA, if i'm ever that good. Currently i'm -[clanless]- as my nick puts it.    If your ever in the game, and you just got fragged by -[clanless]- Jenova, you'll know thats me.  Look out for when i become WKA Jenova, because then, you'll have no chance.    Lates
