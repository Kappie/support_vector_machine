After that did abit of my homework again, then bing rong msg me to watch discovery channel. There's this documentary on Bruce Lee, to me, the greatest martial artist that had ever lived...It talked about his works, philosophy on martial arts. It is kinda sad still thinking about it, he has no more sons to carry on his generation after brandon died. He also has a lot of interesting quotes. Aiya...no mood for blogging today, must go study le...tomolo test..
