It then had a red bumper, and then my dad found some touch up car ready spray paint stuff so now the bumper looks newer than the car. But it all works out.  My dad took  urlLink his truck  in today to get fixed so I had to drive  urlLink my Sundance  to school. Wiht 185,000 miles of stop and go driving...the tranny on this car was pretty banged up. So sadly enough it couldn't even get me to school. I had to call my grandpa today to get a ride to school.  Lucky for my my dad gets his truck back tonight so I can drive my car around...yay!!!
