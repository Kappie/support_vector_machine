That is what it really involves: simply to stand on one's feet before one's Father and reply to Him in the Spirit.  This business about replying to the Father in the Spirit may sound like big talk but I don't mean it that way. "In the Spirit," in any context I know of, means flat on your face.  How can one stand on one's own feet and be flat on one's face at the same time is a mystery I will have to try to work out by living it.  * Sister Mary was president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious and one of only fifteen women invited to attend the Second Vatican Council.
