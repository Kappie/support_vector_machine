Then my girlfriends sister was covering my eyes during the club scene needless to say I couldn't tell you if it was nude. Then threre's some fake secret agents then this guy shoots Bourne. Then there's a chase. In the end, he admits to some chick that he killed her parents. In the last scene he learns his real name which ironically I too forget, willingly though. The first thought in my head when thinking about a Mat Damon movie was shitty love story, and I was right. Here's the good news, his girlfriend dies. In the very beginning too. She gets shot in the head by this assassin. He's supposed to kill Bourne. This is because he sets Bourne up, the reason? To steal $20,000,000. That's shit. If you're going to steal money you take more then 20 mil. How much did Enron have embezzled? Well this guy is such a good shot he hits Bournes girlfriend and doesn't make sure it's Bourne. Come on what a shitty job. More tomarrow.
