Everyone should know this, so we are told to lay up treasure in heaven.  The question was asked of a rich man who had died. "How much did he leave?" The answer, "all of it!"  What we do here in this life for God will be stored up in heaven waiting for us if we are saved, amd we are not to love this world or the things of this world. If we love the world, the Bible says, "The love of God is not in us."  That nice house, that sporty car, that money in the bank, you are going to leave it, so lay up treasure in heaven by serving and worshiping Jesus.  Marion Jones  Ellaville"   --Taken from Americus Times Recorder website.   Okay...now here's MY take on it!  God wants you to succeed in this life.  I don't think God wants you to be homely and not have anything of value in your name, that's stupid.  I don't think your life should be focused around these materials...but it's not a sin to want to own a sporty car, have money in the bank, or live in a nice house.  Marion Jones I disagree with you...I bet you're poor and just want to make yourself feel better.  With Love.  Tyler -1  Public  -0
