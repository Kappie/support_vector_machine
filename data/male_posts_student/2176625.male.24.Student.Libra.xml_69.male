I'm staying at the Hotel Castello, it overlooks St. Mark's Square and the canal grande. Visited shops in St. Mark's Square, Basilica San Giorgio Maggiore and took a gondola ride on the canal today. My limited Italian isn't a problem here because many shop owners and locals speak a fair amount of English. A presto, arrivedrci!
