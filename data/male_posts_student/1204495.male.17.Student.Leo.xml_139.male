He was pleased today thoug, cause my mum  was there, like she usually is, then i turned up without either of them knowing i was coming, i had economics 'cancelled' so i thought 'what the hell i'll go see my dad' so i did, mum says it cheered him up a bit, my mum and sis are there now, yup my sis is back form uni, again, me thinks shes homesick, ah well shes my sister i don't mind her being her, but yeah i would of gone to see my dad again tonight only i've only just finsihed my paper round :@, but i'm going to see him round dinner time tomorrow, otherwise he'll be on his own, i don't like my dad like this, hes not happy in hopistal, hope he comes out soon
