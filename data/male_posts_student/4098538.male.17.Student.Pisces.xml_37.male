Spent half the day walking aimlessly around town. I am really sleepy today. I fell asleep on the bus ride home and banged my head on the silver railing above the seats. Mandy's coming to stay tomorrow! She's coming really early, so we're gonna have a day in doing nothing. Things are really weird lately. Lots of pointless arguments keep arising and getting really bad. We clash so much. But still, I refuse to give up. I don't care if that's wrong or whatever! We had a great day yesterday. We spent the afternoon in town and went to see The Butterfly Effect... what a good film! Apparently, I spoiled the night because I didn't say hi to her mum when I come into her house and Mandy fell out with me for it. But it's resolved now.
