This is just discussing the idiocy of some politicians here in Holland.  What am I talking about? I am talking about some politicians who want sex with animals to become illegal because it's a way of torturing animals. Anybody with a decent bit of brains sees that this is hipocrite. Therefore just less than half of the politicians agreed.  "Why?" You wonder now. "Why is it so stupid?" (yes, smart guy with that sentance I implied that you probably don't have a decent amount of brains)For those of you who can't think of decent reasons for themselves (and who therefore are talented politicians)I just make a summarisation. But before I do that I have to state one thing. I Am Not An Animal Lover, I Have No Problems With Eating Meat, Nor With Eating Meat From Animals Who Spent Their Sad Lives In A Little Cage.  First reason why the argument sucks is because nobody tested if animals like it or not. Ok, I admit that it's not likely that they like it but it's a first flaw in the argumentation of the politicians.  Second reason: Tormenting of animals? Since when do you give a fuck? You don't care about 100 chickens on 1 square centimeter but if you take out one of those chickens and give it oral pleasure (do chickens have a clitoris?) you're doing something wrong. Ofcourse, you can say "but when it happens with human beings (Iraq) it's wrong, why is it not wrong now?" and prove your ignorance. Human beings are not animals. At least, we might be animals but we're the top of the foodchain. That gives us something extra...  Third reason: Christians might complain. But they forget something. In the book Genesis God gave Adam and Eve the right to rule over all animals (except eating them as a matter of fact, quite ironic isn't it. Read Genesis 1, 26). So as a matter of fact you're not allowed to eat them according to God, but sex...  Fourth reason: The most obvious. We're humans they're animals. If some get pleasure out of having sex then why should ethics of other be in their way.  Anecdote: In my school are some pretty stupid people. The day after I heard the ideas of these politcians I started preaching and ended my speech with claiming that "my cat likes it as well". Lame joke, I agree but it got out of hand. I kept hearing it for weeks after. At some point I got annoyed by it and stopped responding. Except for once. One guy actually asked if I really did it with my cat. I was too baffled by that enormous stupidity to answer 'yes'. Too bad because I would like to have seen his face after that answer. Anyway, this didn't have nothing to do with the previous. Just remember,  You and me baby ain't nothing but mammels so let's do it like they do on the discovery channel...
