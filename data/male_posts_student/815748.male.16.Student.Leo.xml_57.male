This was the result of a number of factors, including my school work, my procrastination, my necessary TV, and my hordes of extracurricular activities.  These included Model UN on Monday (and that takes pretty much the whole day after school since it's not like I'm going to go home); Richie's pseudo-party on Wednesday which took the whole day up till Mock Trials which lasted two more hours, and the remainder of the day was taken up by the return of The OC and a new Law and Order; dentist and babysitting on Thursday; and orthodontist on Friday.  A unit test in history (about the Industrial Revolution, not studied for until Thursday because of Richie's thing) proved the crux of my overscheduling.  Phew.   GOOD  At Model UN on Monday, my resolution went very well, gaining popular support.  I think it'll probably be approved.  Read it at http://www.smetna.com/mun; it's Resolution 1.2.  Matt K-K's resolution (1.1, same site) has good intentions, but it creates a whole new committee that does the same thing as the IAEA but builds new factories and hires new scientists and starts new programmesâ€“ it is, in a word, a boondoggle.  There were new episodes of Judging Amy, The OC, Law and Order, Scrubs, and ER.  Need I say more?  Richie's Wednesday pseudo-party was very fun.  We had pizza delivered and played a Star Wars game, Super Smash Bros. Melee (in which my alliance with John, the Judeo-Armenian Empire, proved virtually undefeatable), and Boston Monopoly (in which a few wheelings and dealings caused hotels to sprout up out of nowhere instantaneously and everyone controlled a row).  It took practically until Mock Trials, and so I couldn't study for my history test until Thursday, but it was totally worth it.  Mock Trials was a success.  Alex Turner and I presented "our" direct examination of Officer Thorndike (I wrote it while he played calculator games), and despite some flaws, Elliot said that we would both be "strong contenders for roles."  I don't know whether he was telling the truth though; he doesn't really have "a basis for being believed."  I drew my last Carter comics; Hemmill and the gang will be gone forever come Monday, but with any luck the new case will lend itself to humor, interest, and chances for me to move up in the Mock Trials hierarchy.  After hearing Sully's terribly-performed cross of Rissa, I still think he'll be a leading Trial-Mocker eventually, but only by default since we have so few good returning players.  I hope to join him in this dominance, mainly so I'll get a role.  Finally, at least the history test is over.  No more industrialization.  Ever.
