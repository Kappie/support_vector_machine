But it doesn't matter since I'm at school or out most of the time. And Michelle came to sent Rose off, along with some messages to past and letters to return. It was like as if she's not coming back. Then Michelle was telling me how her friend writes a departure letter everyday just in case she dies. And then again, that Melissa wrote a letter too before she went overseas. It seemed silly at first. But then, I thought it was kinda cool. So I thought I'd probably write one soon. (Just hope it won't be too late) And Yizhong was telling me how living with the "I'd die tomorrow" mentally can be good. Cause this way you would live each day to the fullest. I thought it was quite true. They say I'm a wolf. Well, I always thought wolves are the bad guys and now they say I'm one. But they're cool la. Especially when they showed a snow wolf for the picture. Cool!!! Anyway, it is really true about how I only confide in a few people. And I have quite a problem confiding too. But this works two way. People find it hard to trust me. I guess that's what I'm sad about.Especially when the people I love and trust most have so much inconfidence and distrust in me. Really sad...sigh...guess it's me. Maybe I tend to make people lose their trust too...sigh... About the world being my playground, I don't think so. I'm not such a "go my way" dominating person. In fact, I often live for others. My life often revolve others, probably cause I don't receive much attention...even at home. You know, my siblings are all good at talking, except me. Now I recall...when I was in kindergarten, I stammered. Then when I went to primary school, I loved to talked, but Dad always scolded me the moment I opened my mouth. So I just kept quiet. Every report card had the comments describe me as a quiet and soft spoken boy. I only started opening my mouth in secondary school...sigh...so now I'm not a good speaker...*cries*...I was like so suppressed. If anybody would notice,I'm actually quite talkative now. I love to talk just that I wasn't allowed too, and now I'm not good at it. Maybe I'm trying to make up now...hehe... Ok...guess I should go. Tomorrow's YF...yippee...but jie not going. Who to talk to? Maybe I'll get to talk to others tomorrow. Anyway, Paul's brother is Tom. We didn't talk much. (we're both quiet) But I think we're not that alike. Maybe a bit of mannerisms, but interest wise, should be still quite different.
