I was inspired because it take alot to bring up old things and to realize that talking is the only way to ever get past anything thats plauging you no matter big or small.   Our problem is almost identical, money is getting tight here 2 because my mom is on disability, and even though she says that she can pay for things for me, im involved in 2 many activities at school that I really need to adopt some form of independency. In realizing this i found that the mere 300 dollars a month isnt cuttin' it anymore. And what my dad doesnt seem to realize is that 4 phone calls and 300 dollars a month doesnt make you a father it makes u a donner. Ive been thinking about alot of things that my dad has done to me my mother and my brother. Maybe he didnt know how much they affected me but they did. Its hard to say what im going to do to resolve this i figure writing a letter would be the easiest but eventually im going to have to face it and it wont be easy. but ill get through it and its relieving to know that someone is going through the same thing thanx chels.
