I can't believe how long some people took, especially Stephanie, Szeman, Sarah, and Madi.  All girls.  Go figure.  Some of them took like more than an hour longer than I took for the first part.  If anybody wants to see "Bon Voyage" with me after school tomorrow or the next day, tell me so.  The Matt thing is fizzling out, though he still says he can do it Friday.  But that's too far away, and I want to go to see it now.  Kickball during chemistry today was alright.  Also, before that, talking with Matt Woolf at lunch was fun.  Oh, and props to Stephanie for lending me the season finale of "The O.C.," that was good.  Also, a couple of nights ago a good short-story idea came to me.  Maybe I'll write it eventually.   So I'll call out your names and you just say whether you're here. --- Mr. Mitchell , my MCAS proctor
