If you could only see the smile.. That you put upon my face..  Unrequited maybe.. But it's oh so hard to say.. I need you in my arms, And I need you here today..  I love you oh so deeply.. How much, You just won't know.. For my feelings are deep inside me..  I can not let them go.. I struggle just to hide them.. In fear you may just find.. A glimmer of emotionâ€¦ shining in my eyes..  So secretly I love you.. Until that sunny day.. When I can tell my feelings to you.. And maybe have my way..
