Does that make sense to you? You would think you would get more votes by speaking to a crowd of 13,000 then a room full of 100 snooty rich people. Its just plain commen sense.  The fact that it didn't make sense to me wasn't the most disturbing part. The most disturbing part was when i was walking the half mile walk back to the parking lot. There were a crowd of Kerry suporters just outside the gates set up around the park where the rally was held. They wanted to talk to us about our choice in political party. Those guys were fine. When I got a little further down the sidewalk there was a group of people yelling at an old guy who was handing out pro-bush flyers. They had signs saying "get rid of facism, get rid of bush" and it had a big swastica on the poster. While I was looking at the poster, a man with a rather scruffy beard holding a baby walk up to the old man handing out flyers. He started yelling out things like "YOU ARE A CRIMINAL" and "THERES A POLICE OFFICER, HE SHOULD ARREST YOU, OFFICER ARREST THIS MAN, HE IS A CRIMINAL." and "HISTORY WILL PROVE THAT WE WERE RIGHT". I wanted to walk up to one of them and ask "If you were in Bush's posistion, what would you have done? Not just 'Don't go to war', but what would you do exactly?" I would bet that none of them could answer it. Most of them don't really think about what would have been better, it's just anybody but Bush.  It's sad to think that the future of this country rests in the hands of people like that.
