So I decided to start one up for your viewing pleasures. But man, now that I've started it, I got no idea what to say. So I'll just say whats on my mind...   I need to clean up. My room just started housing my local pests. Sure you can say I'm a dirty cat, but I wont care. I need to bug my room.   And now, a little something for your senses "black metal ad" click link son... urlLink http://www.users.qwest.net/~skanne6249/Sounds/BlackMetalAd.mp3    On a serious note, as my first blog, I'm going to make this one memorable, I'll tell you about my day... and how dope it was. First off, my brother and me went jogging like we always do every morning. When I had gotten home, I was starving, so I whipped up somethin good to eat, and while it was cooking up, I went back in time and watched a movie, so old school, there wasnt even old school and new school back then. TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: COMING OUT OF OUR SHELL TOUR... now for you non-fans, thats a tape of the teenage mutant ninja turtles concert, with live actors as the turtles. They also had a live actor as Splinter, April O'Neal, Baxter Stockman, The Foot Clan, and The Shredder. The songs they performed were probably on par back in the day, but now, they're on something. Something like crack cocaine. I still enjoyed it. After I finished eating and watching that, I went and walked around the house cause we dont have any cable right now, so really, there isnt much to do. I got a bunch of last generation systems, snes, nes, genesis, obese gameboy. I shouldn't be bored, but having those for like 10 years or longer, you can get bored fast. Even from the fun games. Those timeless classics like Super Mario World, Street Fighter II, Super Double Dragon. Yeah...so I decided to get on the computer and burn more hours from my life. After a couple hours of burning, I was hungry again. So I whipped up something good to eat, once again, and went back in time and watched a movie. X-Men the cartoon series, episode 1: Night of the Sentinels. Now thisseries is something to make a religion from. X-Men... ah... Memorable scenes include; Morph sacrificing himself to save wolverine with his line: "WOLVERINE! PULL BACK!", and when The X-Men raid the sentinel factory and Wolverine hops on a sentinels back and yells: "THIS ONES FOR YOU MORPH!" and pummels the back of the sentinels neck with his claws. So yeah, I came now and typed all this up for you.   Today's Message from Erwin:Get back to your old roots, watch all your retro tapes. Nostalgia is Bliss
