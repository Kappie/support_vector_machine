I look back into my archives and laugh, because I was a funny little wanker.  Now look at me.  Waah waa waah.  Anyway.  Me mama's b-day was on the 2nd, and I'm buying her a vaio to appease her.  And do her mail and whatnot.  All the more 'puter for me to DOOM 3 ON!!!  Yeah, I have it.  Yeah, its so scary, sometimes I don't want to play it....  But I can't for more than 20 minutes anyway.  I've figured that my games crashing isn't a problem due to HEAT, since Aaron Keck and Dustin Graybill rewired my Case and put arctic silver thermal paste over my heatsink. My AMD's temperature right now is around 48 C.  Which would be normal, or so.  Critical is around 70, and after doom 3, its 52....  Unreal crashes fairly fast, too.  Hmm... d2 doesn't at all.  So I'm thinking that its my Graphics card being gay as usual.  Derek thinks that the modern games put too much demand on my onboard AC97 sound, and thats why it crashes to desktop.  Well, Dustin lent me some soundcards, and maybe that will stop the hardware buffer from overflowing.  Or maybe it is the graphics card and time for me to kill Chris parker with an x800 pro.   I got paid, whoop de fuck.  I got my classes. Whoo-hoo.  I'm almost done with my biology, I can do a chapter every day, so I'm planning on using tomorrow to start/finish chapter 53?  And tuesday to thoroughly PWN chapter 54.  Leaving me 2 weeks to do chapter 55.   OH!  I FUCKED UP MY ALIGNMENT!! WOO.  I was speeding in front of LC *teacher lot* and I was changing the bass boost on my stereo, cranking the volume on Holy Wars (Alex Apostol and Chris Parker truly can respect that) and I wasn't paying attention and hit a curb!  My first one on my own, its a milestone.  Now I have to fix it.  Christ, what else.  What else.  Not much else.  I'll think of more.
