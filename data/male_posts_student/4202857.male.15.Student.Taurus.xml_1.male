Nothing is perfect in reality but through our eyes there are certain things that are perfect and imperfect. For example, the girl you admire or love most, you would think she is perfect because you love her and love clouds away her imperfection. Another good example would be art, if something is drawn to how the object looks like, then he would not be an artist but just someone who copies things and has no creativity. But if your an artist you would imagine the object and draw what you see, there may be flaws in the drawing but you would not care because you know that's what makes the picture look perfet.  However, some people want to be perfect but they forget that whats on the inside is more important then whats on the outside. They are just being like the blind artist, who only can copy how others look. They only care what others think of them but why do they care? The people around you like passer-bys do not know who you are, so why should you care? Instead you should look towards the people who do care. They do not care if you're fat or if your not pretty, because they know you and how you are on the inside, they love you and they dont bother abt how you look because you are perfect the way you are in their eyes. And if you change that image then many other things will change. To me i will never change how i look like because i know that how i look like does not matter.
