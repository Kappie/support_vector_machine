Actually, Tyke might post a mini-post tomorrow morning before he leaves if he has time but in all reality the streak will be broken.  Hey, here's something that Tyke would appreciate...if somebody could go back and find when Tyke's streak started.  Tyke knows it goes back into November but he doesn't know how far and he could be wrong still.  But Tyke hasn't always posted a blog on every consecutive day, for instance he blogged Thursday on Thursday night and then Friday on Saturday morning (like 1 AM).  So if someone wants to spend a while doing that, thanks.  Just leave a comment saying the consecutive days number and that would be so greatly appreciated.  But other than that, this is sort of sad.  Tyke has blogged about every single day of 2004.  And...wow Tyke really is sad about his blog not being blogged for at least 2 days.  This blog is truly a feat in Tyke's mind.  Who else has the dedication to write something every single day with made up names and ideas, and spend at least 30 minutes every day doing so.  This has come at the sacrifice of homework, chatting, and food.  Tyke sometimes starves himself for a while just to get his blog done.  It is his baby and he loves it.  In a few weeks it will be grown to the point that it can survive on its own for 3 weeks while Tyke is in Europe.  There is a chance that Tyke can either do some email, or maybe a blog while he is in Europe, but don't be expecting it very often.  Ok, back to today's events.  Tyke got up at 6 and finished off his portfolio.  Then he came to school (in his HOT pink shirt) and had a fun day.  He didn't really have to do anything all day.  In 2nd period Tyke talked with that junior girl for much of the period, just about things like her boyfriend and relationships and it was a really stimulating conversation.  Maybe it was just cuz they were talking in weight training and that's a weird environment but still, it was a little weird, but in a good way.  Then Tyke put his pink shirt back on and went to Gov where they were just doing presentations and Amed asked Dolores to prom in his speech.  It was funny.  After that was English and it was sorta stupid but whatever.  Actually when Tyke and Amed acted out Waiting for Godot, they did a good job.  Tyke really felt comfortable being Estragon (Tyke pronounces it Estrogen to be phunny).  It was fun as well.  Then came lunch and Kinker's prom asking.  Then the day was basically over. After school Tyke played bball with Amed and Dr. Phil and were later joined by Piggy J and Big Twigg.  Tyke gave Little Twigg the key to his mailbox so that he could intercept Tyke's deficiency come Wednesday.  The gang talked mostly about prom and those kinds of things while Tyke tried to dominate the games.  Then Tyke came home and got food and packed stuff.  He is an over-packer for sure.  And a little metrosexual as he is taking 2 belts on the trip.  Yeah, he does like clothes and being neat.  But he's far from hardcore metrosexuality.  And now comes that part in the blog.  It is the denoument.  The action is ceasing.  The blog streak winds down.  It has been a blast.  And Tyke will take this opportunity to thank every single person who has ever read this blog because it's cool.  Tyke likes an audience and a good audience brings out the ham in Tyke.  And not ham as in a Jewish joke (inside joke).  So hold tight and hope for a quick return to Tyke The Tremendous!
