Oh yea I bet in 30 years I will be wondering,  hmmm I wonder if these two shapes are similar or congruent.   Or maybe in college I will be trying to figure out which pizza is a better deal by finding the area of the pizza and then comparing the price to find out how much each damn little piece of pizza is worth.    And finally I have proof that not even the math teachers don't know when we would use these subjects in our lives.  We were doing some theroms or whatever and it was boring so we asked, "when will we use this later in life?"  The teacher replied,"in college courses."  We said, "No, when will we use this outside of school."  You know what she said??  NOTHING .  She couldn't think of anything so she changed the subject lol.    Here is my idea.  We should be taught what we actually need in life.  Like how to do taxes, and other finances that we will actually need to know to get through life.  But no....that would be to convenient wouldn't it?
