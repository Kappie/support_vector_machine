And you should too, with all this crazy inhumane weather! On a side note, Jaimie IMed me today and she said her computer was going really slow. So, I have her a few points and it helped her! I thought it might be a good idea to pass this information along to you guys also. If you're experiencing a slow computer, the #1 thing you do is clear any unnecessary files on your computer. Secondly, with the help of our little friend Micro$osft, there is a little utility called "Disk Cleanup". I'm not sure about other operating systems, but on Windows XP, it can be found at Start > Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Disk Cleanup. After going through that, it's also a good idea to defrag your hard drive. To understand what it is, here's a little definition from Microsoft:    "Disk Defragmenter is a system utility for analyzing local volumes and locating and consolidating fragmented files and folders. You can also defragment disks from a command line using the defrag command."       This utility can also be found under System Tools (see above information). Depending on the size of your hard drive, this may take a few hours. I suggest you do this when you're in bed and let it do its work. Then, when you're done with this, clear your cache and cookies. These little objects are saved on your computer every time you visit a site. To clear cache and cookies, go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > Internet Options. Once you get there, click on the 'Delete Files' and 'Delete Cookies' buttons.   Once you have done all of this, restart your computer. Your computer should be running a little bit faster. If it doesn't work for you, at least I know it helped someone! And if you have any other suggestions, please use the comment feature and leave a suggestion in there for others. Thanks!
