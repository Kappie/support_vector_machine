Everything goes back to normal and everyone starts talking. It seemed like that whole class was avoiding me. Not one person spoke to me this morining before registration. We had art 1st lesson. I was put on to tidy the draws while everyone else had fun so that was good. I was upset all day and then i spoke to my form tutor. She made me feel a bit better about my  self. We had our leavers foto as well which i couldnt smile for cos i have forgotten and then i had to sit for 2 hours in a hall listening to this partonising bitch talk about the end ofn term. So today was not as bad as yesterday. Thats all there is to report today. I will post later with tonites news about my life.   signing off
