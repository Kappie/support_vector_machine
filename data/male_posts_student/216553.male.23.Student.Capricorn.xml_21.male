I'll be fine, I think!  Well, I also got my plane tickets today...and now, $973USD later, I'll be back in Mississauga on Friday, August 13th at 4:43pm!!  So mark that down on your calendars folks!  Just kidding.  We had an interesting second hour during neuro today.  Our professor gave us a mock clinical question which pretty much incorporated everything that we've learned throughout the semester thus far.  We had to work in groups, and let's just say that my group had a rather comical member ;)  Let's put it this way, when our professor asked us to present the case, they said, "this patient has cerebellar damage because the occulomotor nerve comes out of the cortex..."  We're sitting there dumbfounded!!  Maybe you're thinking that this was an honest[sic] mistake, but noooo....this same person asked the other day during lab, "Excuse me Dr. D, where are the suture's on the brain?"  I mean, you don't even have to know much about medicine to know that a suture is between BONES!!  Ack!!  Ok, now back to the wonderful world of neuro.  JL, I hope you're doing well btw!  Byee.
