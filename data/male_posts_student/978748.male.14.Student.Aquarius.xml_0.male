Yeah, today was cool cuz i went to stefans and AJ stole some chick's bikini top and threw it in a tree.  and we caught a glimpse of her topless and yeah, it was kickass.  oh, and austin + peanuts + binder paper = teh LOL.  yeah, i cant do shit tomorrow cause my moms making me do chores and hw all day, which is really fuckin gay.  Anyway, anyone wanna do somethin on monday?  I got nothin to do so yeah.  SPORK!
