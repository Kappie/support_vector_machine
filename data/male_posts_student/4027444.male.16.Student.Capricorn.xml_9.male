Keep in mind that this is just preliminary clicking in the BNW (Brave New World) of the Barrhaven suburbs (tho there are a few shots from downtown) and I won't start shooting any of my more serious architectural, urban, technical stuff until next week. So any of the stuff I shot up ti'll now will go into SCRAPS. In any case I have school tomorrow ;(
