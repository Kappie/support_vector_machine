Not ina bad way, just that there's no reason to go YEEHAW and shoot a cowboy in the foot :P      Yesturday i was up till like 1:30 talking with Lindsey. It rocked so much, cuz we get along so well, but I know if I try and think of it as any more than friends, I'ma get sad again when she leaves. So although I'm gonna have fun hangin with her when we do, I gotta make sure not to get super-attached. It's all good though, as long as we're friends, I'm happy.      It's kinda surprising that we've stayed in touch over her constant moving, and our constant changes of mind. Well... MY constant changes of mind. I think for some reason we were meant for each other, not necessarily romantically, but meant to be together. I know she feels the same way in that respect, and that's super cool as well :P      Hm. Aint done much lately, as per usual. Adam came pciked us up today, and we went shirt-shopping with him. Adam's cool, and he's alot like me so we get along well. Kinda sucks that we werent closer in age, cuz there's stuff that he does (or used to do) with Shawn, that I could never get into or do. But I like hangin' with him on the weekdays, me him and Zach. Adam's a good guy.      As for the rest of today, I'm prolly gonna sit around till Mom gets home, then prolly call Lindsey later on. We were supposed to ahng out last night, but Momma didn't agree to it since it was already like 10:30 by the time Lindsey was ready to go. She's out today, so depending on when she gets back, we may or may not hang out. I'm so anxious to see how she looks now. I know she's still the same awesome girl I met almost two years ago, but seeing her for the first time in that amount of time... it's just gonna blow my mind. I love that girl to death. Love in a friendly way, like I'd do anything for her... but y'know... I wouldn't do ANYTHING for her, cuz that's not my deal. But I'll do anything easily attainable for her :P
