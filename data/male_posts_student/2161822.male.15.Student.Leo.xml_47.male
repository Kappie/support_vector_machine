DOES anyone read it? How will I ever know? Socratic method of teaching sucks. So let's see what did I do yesterday. Well since no one was going out, I stayed home. And even if they did go out, the mall sucks. So yeah I sat at home doing nothing. What fun. I think the greatest website has to be Newgrounds.com. Visit www.newgrounds.com now and enjoy.  Listen to H.I.M.
