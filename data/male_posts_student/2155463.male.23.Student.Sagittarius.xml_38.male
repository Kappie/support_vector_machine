Indeed, I'm actually getting excited about the opportunities I think I might have in law...maybe that's only because I haven't actually started law school yet and gotten worn down by the system, but I think this might have more to do with the fact that I'm letting myself get excited about it.  I just started to realize this a couple of weeks ago, how I didn't get excited about things in the future very much because I didn't let myself do so.  It probably goes back to how I get my hopes really high when I expect something and tended to have crushing disappointments when I was a kid (and some even after I got older), so I think that recently (i.e. the past several years) I've just decided to not get too involved with anything.  But I don't think this is the right way to go about things; to not get myself involved is to rob myself of the strongest motivation behind doing something.  To hope is to risk disappointment - to go through life being risk-averse so that one doesn't have to hope in anything robs one of the greatest joys that life has to offer.  One might think that it would also prevent someone from experiencing life's greatest pains, but I don't think this is true - in an odd way joy and pain are two sides of the same coin, and sometimes experiencing the one is the only way that we can appreciate the other.  To experience neither doesn't make one's life more happy, but simply blase, boring, tepid.  Of course, despite all this talk about hope and all actually doing so is still a struggle for me.  Hope/faith is like a muscle - it gets stronger with use, but disuse leads to entropy, and it can take a while to get it back in shape.  In the meantime I keep trying to find "safe bets" on things that I can hope for, but I know that eventually I'm going to have to risk a little more, put more of myself on the line.  I just pray to God that He is in the details, and that it all turns out for the best...   Bebo Norman - I'm Alright  I've got a little hope in my pocket, I want to share a bit with you Just be careful that you don't drop it, but don't worry if you do 'Cause I got broken down inside me, and I might just need some help But I will get by  And I've got demons in my history, got bone beneath my skin But I've been taken by a mystery, yes, I've been taken in And sometimes voices down inside me try to fight me for myself I will get by  What have I got to live for If there's nothing beating in my chest What have I got to live for When this world starts turning, it's burning me up I'm alright  I used to think love was just a barter, second hand coincidence What doesn't kill you just makes you harder, so I used my common sense Keeping cold to keep my distance, â€˜til you took my pride away Now I will get by  I am not afraid, no, I am not afraid And I will not go crazy here  I've got a little hope here in my pocket, I want to share a bit with you So just be careful that you don't drop it, but don't worry if you do 'Cause I got voices down inside me, and I might just need some help I will get by  What have I got to live for If there's nothing beating in my chest What have I got to live for When this world starts turning, burning me up When my heart is hurting, I'm learning the rough When this world starts turning, it's burning me up I'm alright
