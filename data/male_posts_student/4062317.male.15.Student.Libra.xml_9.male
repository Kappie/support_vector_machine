The Canadian athletes look like bums not even able to pass qualifying rounds. Anyways if they dont start doing better they might aswell pull the whole team out of greece. Actually they should just stick to winter Olympics. Hopefully they will start doing better, on that note I bet that Canadians are more excited about the World Cup of Hockey then the Summer Olympics. Hockey rules. Go Canada Go!  lates,  Smog
