Yup....got a bit bored after school so decided to take that little survey. Not much to talk about today...it was same old @ school...band,history,civics,math,and then programming. Yup...  So I got up at 6:20am today for band, and yes it was early. So ate, got dressed, usual morning stuff and then off to school I went. And the music isn't much better on the radio at 6:20am. Same crap that it plays any other time in London. So after 15 minutes of driving or so, got to school. Fred for some reason got to school in a Checker, which kinda surprised me. Not everyday you see a kid go to school in a checker limo.  Band was just a run through of all the songs through the year. Apparently next Friday we got a concert. Also, I have to play on the 26th @ Centennial with the rest of the Senior Band. For some reason though they have intermediate and 9er band playing next Friday. So we ran through pieces, and then left. Mr. Clark has officially lost my practice log, so I gotta find a way to record down all my practice dates now.  History....oh yeah today we didn't do much since we had elections for grade reps. Lots of people were running this year, so after careful deciding *two I already decided earlier and one random one* I decided to elect in Fred Wu, Amy Chick and Burke Adams. Meh...if it's anything like the previous reps nothing's gonna happen =P. Hmm...other reps I didn't really pay attention to, but yeah I think they did a good job with their speech. I Think. So when getting back up to our rooms, we just did research for our projects. Ugh gotta start my slideshow soon, plus study for civics, PLUS do the essay part of the project. Ugh so much work...least May Camp will clear my mind out for a day or two =P.  Civics....we studied/reviewed for our exam next Wednesday.  And for lunch. We were gonna go to Starbucks, but that changed when Starbucks I forgot they don't sell much food. So we went to McDonald's today. Some random old guy was talking to John, and some random lady was yelling down the street also. Yes downtown is kinda weird. Hmm.....Jason also came to lunch today, and after eating we all just walked back to school.  Math: reviewing for exam....and the test also. So today we did review Questions.  Programming: Helped move tables. And I'm done my turing program =). That's pretty much it...don't know what much else happened. Yeah...that's basically it.  Then got home....balled for a bit on Paul's old net, drummed, SC, h/w, and tonight watching the Calgary vs. San Jose game. Hopefully they win tonight, and if they don't well hopefully the road game trend continues, as that means Calgary will win =P.  Anyways....I'm off to eat now. Later.
