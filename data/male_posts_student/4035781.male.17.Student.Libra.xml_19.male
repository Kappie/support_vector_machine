In addition to that driving lessons and karate are also gonna take up large portions of time. Was also considering taking kung fu as well. Being kept busy is a good thing though, takes your mind out of dark corners and makes the body strong.  The desire to train is strong in me as of late... spent over an hour after midnight doing nothing but conditioning, stretching, practicing. Not enough room in my bedroom for kata though, barely enough room to step and kick.  Just for note, I don't profess to be perfect. I am human, consequently I am flawed, subject to mistakes like any other mortal. Most of what I post on this blogg are on My thoughts, My ethics, My way of life and how I view the world. I am not a perfect person; however, I shall always strive to live my life to the fullest.
