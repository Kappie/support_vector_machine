After that, I watched cartoons while eating breakfast (chee cheong fun and the grass jelly drink). After watching shows, I went online.  I chatted with XC cat and Wendy. XC recommends us a burning software to burn our music on. Thanks XC! Then, at 12, lunch arrived (dried spicy instant noodles with fishball and cuttlefish! mmmm!). Then, Wendy's brother said I have to help him buy lunch in exchange for the burning of my CDs (well, he  borrowed  it from the office after all). Alright, I agreed lor.   I left home at 1.40. And oh my! The sky sure was dark! Thunder was rumbling ever-so-frequently, the sky threatening to pour it's heavy load of water on the poor mortal souls down below! I quickly boarded the 913 bus to Wendy's house. Upon alighting, drizzles of rain started to drop down. Ahh! The sky has finally let out! I thought of a poem while walking to Wendy's house, which I will write at the end of this entry.  Finally reached her house. Wendy was burning CDs for herself when I went in. Then, Arman called. Wendy and Arman talked for some minutes. After that, both of us went off to buy lunch (and hopefully a new CD for me).   What cruel fate has befell upon us! It was raining, and there's no form of shelter whatsoever! We have to dash here and there, getting out of the rain as soon as possible. We finally arrived at 888. I brought the lunch for her brother and her (he insisted that I buy), while Wendy checked out the CD-R. Well, it turned out that I need another 50 cents to buy the CD, and Wendy brother gave us 50cents less. Sigh!! After buying lunch, we dashed back to her house.  There, we started burning. I made the CD covers for both of us using MeiYing's as a guide. While waiting for the CDs to burn, we read magazines (Teenage) and played Chocobo Racing. Finally, at 6pm, 89 songs were burnt into 5 discs! Finally! I missed some songs (like Britney's My Only Wish This Year), but oh well. After watching Wendy complete Storybook Mode, we went down to eat.   Wendy and I ate chicken rice while her mom ate fried kueh teow. I brought back fishball noodles for my brother. While crossing the road, Wendy's mom said that my brother, being Sec 2, is too lazy to buy his own food and bullies me. Younger brother bullying elder brother! HaHa! My brother had a violent reaction to her words. Oh my!!  After coming back, I took a bathed, studied Chem and Physics for a while and came online. There! Oh yes yes. The poem!    Rain   Drops of rain, Slowly intensify. Anger of the sky, Erupted.  Isn't this a good poem? I used short sentences (singular words even) to emphasize the rain-fall into somethhing more than just mere water dropping from the sky. I am quite proud of this work! I am gonna save it later! I already have a collection of haikus. Now I am having collection of short poems too. I just love poems!  Alright! That's the end! Wish me luck in the Practical tomorrow! See ya tomorrow, blog! Goodnight!
