Even though it's only year 10 end of year exams they've given us exam leave and I don't have any exams on Monday or Tuesday.  Last Friday we (Me, Dave, Louise, Rachel and Helen) all went for coffee, and Rachel saw Ollie on the way, so he joined us as well, that was cool. I also bought a Kyuss album " urlLink ... And then the circus leaves town " Then I went home and did some revision, then went to Rachel's with Dave and Heather, for food which Rachel made herself, lasagne for the main meal and then meringues for dessert.(I probably spelt both of them wrong) I was most impressed with the cooking, we had wine and sat at the dinner table and everything, it was great. Then we watched Mulholland Drive, I think I understand that film now, a bit better than I used to anyway.  Yesterday I did revision, and played this new RTS Jon got, called " urlLink Besieger " it's actually really good. Then went off to that gig in the Holy Trinity Centre, like everyone was there almost, and the bands played well, I mainly went for Joe Master cos I was eager to hear what they sounded like, and they were really good.  After said gig I went to Beddington Park with Hattie, big Tom, Emma and of course Dave. We went to the rope swing and there Daniel joined us, that was most fun. Then we all decided to go home, but cos Ging likes walking the streets at night and Tom lives just round the corner they came back to mine for tea first.  Today I only really woke up, and my mum has already told me I'm doing loads of revision today, she keeps telling me to do revision I've already done, but I plan to half half my day with revision and besieger.
