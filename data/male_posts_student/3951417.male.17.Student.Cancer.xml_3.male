Currently showing at all pirated CD stalls in Angeles. Near Jollibee, to be specific. While youre at it, send me a porn CD. Be discreet. :-)   Oh yeah, fuck you Ely Buendia for leaving Eraserheads the greatest band ever formed. goddamn you to hell. Hmmm.... Itsumo = STUPID. Nakaboso na naman ako kanina. Yey....
