That's why I like being able to write source-code as opposed to using a " W hat  y ou  s ee  i s  w hat  y ou  g et" HTML editor. It feels like cheating for me. The teacher told me I could just write it using source-code. In fact, she said later, we won't even be able to use the WYSIWYG. That will work out handsomely for me, since I've never really used them in the past, and don't intend to in the future. Well, that's probably all for today, or now at least. No school tomorrow. Actually, that makes me a bit sad. I like "A" days (periods 1-4). Those are my easiest classes, and the days I get out at 1:30. Well, I have to go train my Ninja Ferrets to take out the Evil Bunnies (that was for you Kelly, in case you are reading). See ya!
