You know what I think of that? Fuck the court, fuck the law, fuck the police, fuck the government, fuck all authority, help save Alex Lifeson from going to jail, make a stand against the "powerful." That's fucking bullshit. Oh big deal, so what did he do, push the cop? Alex wouldn't do anything lethal, he's a great and funny guy. So what, push a cop and get 15 years.But if hepunched out some random bum, it would just be a fight...that's it, no penalties. What makes a cop so much more powerful, they havemore rights that us? What if you attack a copyou get in more trouble? That's bullshit. Just because he's trying to justify the law,don't give me that bullshit.The cop Alex touched was notjustifying any law.And maybe it's not even the cops fault. Maybe it's the pussy ass governmentwe have that has a lawfor everything.I bet Alex was having fun in some house getting drunk on New Years and then the copscrashed the party so Alexdid something. Who fucking cares. You gonna give a man 15 years for being drunk and messing around with a cop. What the fuck is with this world. We need some NEW WORLD ORDER!!! That's right you heard me.If some school principal or government figure saw this, I'd be screwed because wetruely don'thave the right to say thingslike this.We are told we have the rights. But we don't. Well I'm making my own fucking rights and life. Look at Martin Luther King, he surehad theright.Of course it's our right for freedom of speechbut everyone knows there's major consequences. What's so free about that? I'm sick of hearing about law and order from dick heads that are only human just like you and me.SO RISE WITH ME! SOMEONE TAKE A STAND WITH ME! AND GET RID OF THIS FUCKING WORLD AND CREATE A NEW....WORLD.....ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!! Does anyone hear me!? Rise my people. RISE!Get rid of our fuckin government and create a government that is REALLY FREE. THIS COUNTRY IS NOT FREE. WE HAVE LAWS OVER EVERY FUCKING ASPECT OF LIFE. Someone get Queer Eye For The Straight Guy gay guys to go over to the whitehouse and ass rape every stupid politician including Mr. Monkey himself, Bush. Ok that was fun. I'm done ripping on our country.
