This town is far, far too small. Because Luke and I don't spend enough time together, he and I took Laura to Golden Port. We followed our dinner at the best restaurant in Rochester with some fine, fine theatre: we watched 50 First Dates at the Movies 10 - the hub of Rochesterian culture. Later that evening, I had a little drinky drinky at Eric's house - a young man I had met at the hippy house. The house was full of Pittsford Sutherland graduates. Is there anything better than a house full of ignorant, rich trash? Yes. There is. There, I met a super cool medical student. We got along well and we went to many-a-bar and club. I impressed him with my uncanny rhythm and belly dancing. Thank you, Shakira. Phone number was asked and given, and shortly thereafter, called. One day, I will learn Arabic and take over the world.  Speaking of speaking Arabic, after frequenting des clubs, Mr. Pittsford Sutherland and I ate at Gitsi's and had our first real conversation of the night. He asked me my ethnicity - my favorite question of all time - and I wondered why I was getting along so well with someone from Rochester -- Pittsford, no less. (If I learned one thing in my four years in this dismal place, is how I should avoid speaking to anyone who is from this dismal place). Ahhh!!! HE'S LEBANESE! Too cool to be white, he is fluent in Arabic and French. Tu es tres cool, aussi!  Every day is an ode to Luke. He keeps me fat and happy. He saves me from loneliness and misery, starvation and boredom. He is the funniest person I know. His humor is absurd and incessant. Life without him wouldn't be a life at all. This is the third summer Luke and I have spent together, and every year gets better and better. Our first summer, we were both poor working students, obsessed with our lack of food and spending endless hours at the gym. Our days were filled with unbearable heat and unbearable calorie-counting. We both lost a ton of weight. We were starved and happy.  Our second summer was a blur to me. I had a huge monkey on my back. There was much liquor and involuntary expulsion of food. Luke watched as I ruined my life and esophageal lining with the patience of a saint. He isn't the only one, but he was the first one. He could have given up on me then, but didn't.  Summer #3. Yeah. We're having a great time and I have the waistline to show it - Luke has the credit card bills to show it. Mr Fischer is my hero, sacrificing all his time, money, and effort to keep me from jumping in the river. Luring me from the edge with his stabbing humor, I can only thank him for trying to save my life.   urlLink    Starved Yet Happy Luke urlLink
