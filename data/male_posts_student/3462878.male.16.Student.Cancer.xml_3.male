Right, picture the situation, I make a massive city, with taxes that aren't too high, but I'm still not getting enough money. Right, I've made things that have high monthly maintenance costs, that I'm convinced can't not have a place in my city (things such as the Empire State Building, the John Hancock Centre, and the White House, there's also bridges, shops and roads and stuff, but they aren't that important :p), and I can't get enough money in to break even.   Such as, at one point, I was losing 30,000 a month (thank fuck for cheats!!) but I was making a bit back, I don't know how, but I was.   I think it all stems from not having enough money in real life (I wish there were cheats!) I don't know.
