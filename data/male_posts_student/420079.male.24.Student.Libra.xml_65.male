It is very squishy.... mmm, tired. The problem with getting a new bed during finals period is that all I want to do now is sleep! Well, that's all I wanted to do before too, but now I have more reason to do so. *sigh* I didn't know they would be able to deliver it the next day! I thought I would have to wait a week!  *breathe* Two days. I will be done in two days.  So far finals have gone well. Think I nailed at least 1, and maybe 2 of them. We shall see. Too bad I know *nothing* about Global Perspectives. (Yes, nothing. Literally nothing. What the hell did we do for three months?!!!!!??!!)  After the Global slaughter on Friday, I will have 2+ weeks of R before my 6th Circuit appellate court externship begins. That means seven weeks of a daily 1 hour commute, PLUS working my ass off on a daily basis.  Then another month and a half of laying around on my ass. Oh, and getting in shape.  Then school begins again on August 23rd... damn, they don't give us much time, do they?
