Funny things happen to me... which is I few days always stare when talking to people... Not only this, I felt so listless... I feel tired, but can't seem to rest well... Worst of all, I am beginning to hate food... No appetite... More worst than last time... which is phobia for food... Even my mum I did not let her know of this... Even I force myself to eat... I will end up vomitting sometimes... which is quite unbearable and uncomfortable... Now, during studying in ITE, it boost my determination to get better results then in the past... I am trying to become competitive with others... which make me very stressed... thats why I felt study is more important... Without study I will be nowhere in society... I live by a dream, which is to set up my own business in the future... I always wish to study at overseas country which is not near singapore... Such as Spain or Rome... But if really want to study overseas, my mom would only allow me to go as far as Australia only... Having a dream or planning will enable me to motivate myself... Only a person changed me during this two years... Which I know through by internet game... She used to give me advice when I quarrel with my mom in the past... Now, my mum and I are in very good terms... Even though I think she is just entertaining :P.. But I took it seriously.. I hope that she will be happy always... and score well for her O levels... I share the same type of cartoon character with her... which is Garfield... But i felt that she and I are worlds apart... As her knowledge is far exceeding me...Even though she is 1 year younger than me... but she seem to have more experience in life than me... Thats why I felt I am a failure in my life...
