I mean, they get to go have fun and I have to stay at work!  Well, I guess it's not that bad.  I am getting paid more this month.  I'm working my ass off for it, but still ...  It's worth it!  Well, a few night's back I saw The Village.  It was a pretty interesting movie.  I recommend it to anyone who really feels like the world needs a change.  It has one hell of twist for an ending.  Go check it out!  As for things back at home ...  not so good!  Maria's grandfather passed away this morning.  I just hope I can support her as much as I can.  My heart goes out for your grandfather!
