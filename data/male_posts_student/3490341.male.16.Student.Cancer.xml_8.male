The history exam wasn't too bad but the questions are always too detailed in one specific subject. Say i had to speak about the sand creek massacre. i could have spoken about all the battles but getting all the marks possible out of the one subject is pretty hard to do. Im hoping to buy a couple of things while in York. Ther main is the book called The Curious Incident of the dog in the nightime. This is meant to be a very good book from the perspective of a young autistic boy. Im also looking for a side satchel as i think it will suit 6th form better. Anyway i better be going, much to do
