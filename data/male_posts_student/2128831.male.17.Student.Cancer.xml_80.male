Not ripped or torn or anything of that nature but the back on my kick ass pony shoes, the blue suede leather ones that match my messenger bag to the T.  Well, they make this odd noise when I walk. Right when you roll your foot after placing it down, or maybe I in fact have a very odd walk, which causes those sounds to be released, I am not sure but I will continue to wear these shoes because they are spiffy.    Pet peeve #1: I hate it when cars try to speed up when they see me trying to pass them on the freeway ... what the hell? ... I have a theory on that though ... I think since they see a Dodge Spirit or a Chrysler Lebaron buzzing by and almost catching up to them, they feel like they need to start speeding up ... as if they cant be passed by a sedan... please ... Big mama burns rubber like no other ...  pet peeve #2: SUV drivers who don’t know how big their cars are ... and who cant drive them ... although, it is fun to watch a big ass expedition get stuck coming out of a parking lot ... it goes a li’l bit back then they try to turn the wheel and move forward then they move back a li’l bit then they try to turn the wheel and move forward - its a vicious, hilarious cycle ... always brings a li’l smile to my face ...  pet peeve #3: constant whiners ... I think I can leave it at that ... pet peeve #4: liars who lie about stupid stuff ...   "...a mitten-wearing, bird-flipping whiney-hiney" Mark this down as an incidental observation or life lesson, the unruly bastard child of the current Midwest deep freeze and the often-delicious, road rage-based urge to comment nonverbally on other people's grossly incompetent driving techniques:  You look really goofy trying to flip someone off while you're wearing mittens. It just doesn't produce the same aesthetic result, or message, as you'd get with a gloved or naked hand. I suppose there are gesture quality variances based on the weight or construction of the fabric, but with your garden-variety fleece or acrylic mitten, the traditional one-fingered salute pretty much looks to the object of your hostility as if you're just motoring along and seized by the sudden need to read your own palm like a mobile astrologer or something. And that, safety-conscious driver that you are, you're holding your hand up at eye level instead of studying it in your lap, so's you won't have to take both eyes off the road and away from random tasks such as not broadsiding a family of five in their minivan.  So. With that bit of erudition tucked safely under our thinking caps, let's move on to other current events and see what wisdom we can glean from them:  Ice cream: my downfall, my nemesis, my crutch  How do I stop binge-eating ice cream? I mean, do I avoid it like the plague? Do I downgrade to sherbet? Does anyone know how to change this kind of emotional eating pattern? It really sucks to know that I keep doing this, and so far, although I've lessened the frequency of said ice cream frenzies, they still happen with a vengeance from time to time. What the hell do I do? I don't want my sweet tooth to keep me from my goals. I want health. I just want chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, too. And Tillamook Marionberry pie ice cream. I've got to figure this out. I've just got to. I'm definitely having a hard go of it. Yesterday, as planned, I did get home, shop for some veggies and fruit, make some dinner (buckwheat pancakes with blueberries  eggs/salsa/beans/spinach scramble), and then settle in for my favorite shows. And finally, I got to bed at a reasonable hour. But still, I woke up feeling like hell, so I called in sick to work today and slept all morning--fitfully, but sleep is sleep, you know? I feel better now, although still kind of out of it. Sort of woozy and dizzy mixed with a stuffy nose. I'm just swimming in this sick, thick, sticky world right now, where everything feels hard and unbreathable and it's like my body is manifesting my emotions. Turmoil all around. And I just can't put my finger on it. Anyway, I ate like hell today (ice cream, how I loathe your allure) and paid for it with cramps (sorry, not delicate, but you know, that's life). My intestines hate me. I know this, and still, I ignore them. And then they unleash their wrath on me. Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which is the grossest name ever for a fairly mundane and typical thing that afflicts a lot of people.  Why doesn’t that rule my life?   No ice cream does, it rules my eating life. I know my body is trying to tell me to lay off the ice cream and all things dairy, but do I listen? No, the cold, smooth stuff soothes me, especially when I'm feeling sick and binge-y. Somehow I'll get through this. I know I will. I'll figure it out. I've got to stop letting my emotions rule what I put in my mouth. I know I've been kind of nutzy feeling lately, and I know it will pass, but right now, it is awfully hard. And I will leave you all for my date with Ben and Jerry.  I have decided to take up a new sport, yeppers!  I am gonna take up extreme gay guy pouncing.  My first target… Fabi! *Beware!  Beware!* And here a poem for ya!  Lol, stay spiffy and foxy.  Much hearts and stars to Riley!  Star light, star bright I don’t know why I only see you at night. You are so tiny, yet so luminous, So near yet so far. Words speak not, When we're staring at the same bright star; Through telepathy we know  We're thinking of the same thing. We may be separated now, But only time will tell if they'll be together. And if Jack and Jill really fell down, or Humpty Dumpty falls of the wall; Soon they'll know their fate. Always together, never apart; That is their vow, Forever heart to heart.  Childish I know, but I am corney as a field, nigga'!
