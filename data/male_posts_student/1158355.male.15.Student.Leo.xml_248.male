I have this lesson and then an hour long lesson (as opposed to the normal 30 minute lesson) next Monday or sometime so he can give me a shitload of stuff to work on during the August break. I'm sure gonna miss lessons. Wellhe'll be back in September. Great lesson today, I learned how to read sixteenth rests andmy reading is well improving becauseI'm going through alot of reading with all these books.All I need to do is get reading down, which is hard for me because I'm an idiot. I just figured out a good method...count 1 e+a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a...HAHA I'M ANIDIOT. But it's hard count while playing, Igotta practice that.Fortunetly with the drums Ijust play whateverand it comesnatural.Besides for reading, today I practiced alot of open handedbeats which is opposite of crossed, instead of right hand on hi-hat and left hand on snare,I have my left hand on the hi-hat and my right hand onsnare. I'm hoping to bynext week have open andcross hand about equal, it's amazing how it took me...what, a year to get down playing beats really good butnow only aday or sojust to switch it up with my hands which as all drummers know issome what of a challenge,gotta have lots of coordination. I have plenty. (= But that's the only skillI have. I also realized I've been usingcertain small sticks that really don't pleasureme as much as the ROCK sticks that are bigger and I wasgoing crazy like a pro today on the set with these sticks. I'vecome to a point where drumsis the only thing that matters in my life. Oh yea, Idon't think I mentioned at Montauk I got a shirt that has adrumset on it and says IT'S ALL ABOUT DRUMS. That's my shirt. That's made for me. Ibet somewhere on the tag it  says only for Tom Grimaldi  .So that's all today.Tomorrow Matt and Paul come back from Vermont andmyfirstsoftball game,I've missed8 games but Crystal won'tbe back from Portugal until the end of July and sheonly makes it for the playoffs.But for me 8 is still alot missed so I gotta go to every game...ok bye.    oh yea, check this bullshit out... urlLink http://www.kevinalexanderclark.com/  Yea what a great fuckin drummer. Costs money? Star wars fan club doesn't even cost money. Oh let me waste 10 bucks on a baby drummer who everyone thinks is amazing but doesn't even care about drums!!! It's not fair little shits like this get places when they don't even have talent and people like me practice, the most 9 hours a day, COME ON!
