Michael Newdow did not have custody of his daughter, and therefore the case was "thrown out" The little good news in my opinion was that Clarance Thomas, Sandra Day O'Connor, and William H. Rehnquist wrote and said that Pledge as recited by schoolchildren did not violate the Constitution. Throw in justice Antonin Scalia, and you have 4 justices that have affirmed the phrase "Under God" as constitutional. One reason to re-elect President Bush is affirmed here. Over the next few years, there will probablly be a few Supreme Court openings. President Bush has not been shy of putting conservative and God-fearing judges in our courts.  I'm warning you, the athiests, ACLU, and NEA will not stop at attacking the flag, our national motto, and our historical roots (The Constitution). This time, Newdow was beaten 8-0 but don't expect it to go away any time soon. "The fact that the majority of the supreme court did not address the issue of whether or not the phrase is Constitutional and only ruled that the father does not have the legal standing to raise the issue leaves the door open to further challenges," said Ricardo Soto of the San Diego Unified School District. If they conquer taking away "Under God" references, the next step is to rip off all the crosses on Churches, then they will take away our National Motto. These arrogant and hypocrites on the Left promote tolerance but then turn around and drag their ideological enemies to the ground. Already, we have seen Federal Judge Myron Thompson rule to throw the Ten Commandments, the foundation of U.S. Law and the Constitution out on the street.
