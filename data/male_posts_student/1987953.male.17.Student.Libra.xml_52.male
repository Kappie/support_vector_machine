I came to find out that most breaks teen couples take end in break-ups. I couldn't handle that. I have been crying all the time since Saturday night. I am totally depressed. The only hope I have is that she might even E-mail me soon. I have hope that all we have meant to each other since we met will not just be thrown away. I know that either we will get back together or we will be really good friends because we still like and care about each other a lot. I just hope we can still be together after all this. I can't handle losing her. I would be so jealous of anyone else she ever dated or whoever she married, because they have the greatest girl in the world and I once did and blew it bad. I was such a jerk to her sometimes, especially this past Friday. I just hope I can have one more chance to prove to her how much I love her, and how much I am sorry for being that jerky, and one more chance to prove that I believe with all my heart that we belong together. I can say all that and not be embarrassed because nobody reads my blog anyway.   If anyone wants to see how amazingly cute Brittany and I were together, look at the best picture we have ever taken by clicking  urlLink here . (If you get an error message, go to  www.geocities.com/ripkenfan86  and click on "Picture 1.") I know we could still be that happy if she decided to try it again.  These last two days (since Sunday) have felt like three weeks. They have drawn on so long and I see no "light at the end of the tunnel." But I am staying optimistic and holding on to my hope, because everything will be okay and I know she won't throw away everything we meant to each other.  Brittany, if you're reading this, I know you've heard these words before, from other places, and from a song I gave you a copy of, but, "Wherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you. Whatever it takes, or how my heart breaks, I will be right here waiting for you." I will wait as long as I need to, but since you promised it wouldn't be too long, if I graduate and still have not heard from you, I will probably give you a call. My heart can only take so much before I hit the emotional breaking point, go insane, and require answers.  Anyway, pray for me, and blog you later!  In Christ, Mike >
