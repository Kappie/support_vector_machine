I don't see how they can even remotely get to know one another in that short of a time. I still don't know my friends from my homeschool group very well. And of course at GSP there is quite an emphasis on dating. I don't date. "You don't date?!?!?!? WHY????" Because I know that if I date people, I will get emotionally atached to them, and breaking up will hurt one of us very deeply. Which I definitely don't want. "But how will you find her?" As Peter Liu from  urlLink  7X Teen Ministries  put it so wonderfully:  "I believe God is going to plant her in my path. And by normal, godly interaction, I'll get to know her character. I don't have to date her to know her favorite color, or know what kinds of movies she likes. I'll already have a deep spiritual connection to her. Then I'll see if she's the one I spend the rest of my life with."  Sometimes I wish God would just say to me, "Ryan, look over there. There she is." But that just isn't going to happen. But I do believe that God has a plan for my life, and He will make everything clear to me eventually. BarlowGirl said it perfectly (from a girl's perspective), so just change the lyrics a little.  So what? I'm not your average girl I don't meet the standards of this world Chasing after boys is not my thing See I'm waiting for a wedding ring  No more dating I'm just waiting Like sleeping beauty  My prince will come for me No more dating I'm just waiting 'Cause God is writing my love story  I feel the same way. Of course, it's hard not to date when everyone else around you is dating. But I know that my wife, when I finally meet her (or maybe I already have) is worth waiting for. As Peter continues later on:  "I'm going to wait for my wife. And I know that she's worth waiting for. I know that whenever she smiles, it's because she loves Christ and me, not because I played with her heart. And I won't have to dig through secrets and excruciating experiences to see who she really is. I know at this instant, her heart's already too beautiful for me. I don't want to hurt her. I want her to have all that I can give her. I want her to have a Godly man protecting her. I want her in the arms of a real Man. I want her to wake up and smile at the sight of her husband. I want her to pick me."  And that is exactly how I feel. So to my wife, whoever and wherever you are, I love you, I'll wait for you, And may God continue to reveal himself to you in a truly awesome way. If you ever feel like nobody loves you, I do, and always will. I know you probably won't ever read this, but that's OK. I love you, I love you, I love you.  Ryan
