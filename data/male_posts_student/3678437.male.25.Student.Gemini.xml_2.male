My addiction has gotten to the point that I spent hours trawling for stories, googling character names and pairings, and even rereading whole stories while waiting for updates.   I call this an addiction because  1.  I no longer hanker for a life; I'm more than happy living           vicariously through fictional characters.   2.  I 'ship' with the sort of manic intensity and obsesiveness         usually reserved for proselytizing and terrorism.  My problem is that I spend so much time reading and worrying about FF that could better be used on my own work. Also, the stories are of uneven quality: the ones on SugarQuill are brilliant, but most on ff.net suck worse than my high school essays--though the ideas behind them are good, the use of language is atrocious. The worst part is that by spending so much time reading those stories rather than 'real' fiction, I've managed to pick up more than a few 'ugly English' skills that my creative writing instructor is more than happy to tear into. Every step I take forward in class , I take half a step back on my own.   Great writers learn their craft by studying the Masters; I learn mine from fan girls obsessed with Draco Malfoy. *sigh*
