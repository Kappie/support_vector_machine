Why is that every effing hip hop/rap/psuedo r  (more on that in a minute) song I find on my search engines of choice have those annoying mixtape DJ's yelling in them....I mean is there anything worse?....even the DJ's at the clubs don't yell in the middle of the song that much!  Why is the media leaving us hanging on this whole Chandra Levy and Gary Condit thing?....I mean they were bordering on overkill before September 11th, but you can't tell a nigro half the story and then just say eff it....I want to know now that you done started....where is that chick?!?!?!  Why might the Falcons make the playoffs this year?....Talk about unexpected pleasant surprises....  Okay onto psuedo R have decided that the last real R album ever released was Boyz 2 Men's Motownphilly...and even that is pushing it....actually I recind that last comment....the last real R album was N.E. Heartbreak or Guy's first album...whichever one came out first....this point is not up for argument....only silent observation and head nodding cuz I'm right....  anyways time to go to bed....I'm gonna try and actually go to lab tomorrow morning....  Outro....still enjoying the DSL (heh heh heh OJ)
