College is work, tests, group projects, living in a room as big as a closet, sleep deprivation, eating food not meant for human consumption, being broke, paying too much money for books, falling asleep in class, getting sick every two weeks, living a few feet from people you'd normally never speak to, packing your car to the point you cant see out your rear view mirror, and carrying basically everything you own up 3 flights of stairs and then 4 months later back down the stairs.   Now thats the stuff people bitch about in college, but i definitely have to say...college is a magical, special place. It's like a disney land for those nearing adulthood and those who just wont let go of being a kid(like me). At college, things happen that people either "only could dream about"...things that never in a million years could a person see happening or even doing.  I'm going to try my best to write about those things in list form. Here goes:   Only in College..  -Will you end up having sex with two or more people in the room...while those 2 or more people are awake. -Do you go back home on a 10 minute break, chug a beer and then spend the rest of class smelling like corona -will you drink so much that fat girls appear skinny -do you feel comfortable pissing in front of people..even large groups -will you piss on cars, dumpsters, or in the middle of the quad proclaiming "i'm king of the world" -would you sell your soul for a 'free' tshirt or a keychain -would you wear a shirt that says "got crabs" because its free -will you trade a beer for a TV dinner -will you pay $5 for all you can drink really bad beer -will you encourage your girl friend to show her boobs for beads -will you encourage your best friend to feel your girlfriend's boobs -will you wear the same jeans 3 days in a row, to a party and then for 2 more days -will you budget whatever money you do have for a case of beer at the end of the week -will you not have a clue where you are after drinking the night before -will you drunk IM instead of drunk dial -will you ever find the true meaning of the words natty, beast and key -will "my bad,i was so wasted" be accepted as an apology -will you use beer pong as a measure of manhood -will you leave a party if you lose a game of beer pong -will you drink everclear -will you willingly become an alcoholic -will you do the worst thing possible just because its fun and because you can -will you smoke weed in public and not care -will you recreationally break things and not give a shit -will you sell your body for beads, dress up like a cat, wear tapered jeans and a nintendo shirt, or wear a white shirt so people can write on you, all at parties -will you take one for the team..whether there's a team around or not -will you wait in line for 20 minutes just to piss -will you learn to drive drunk well -will you forget your name, your age, and where you live, all in the same night -will you have sex in a public shower -will you get drunk, puke everywhere, pass out, then be proud of it in the morning -will you get extra sleep so you can party harder tomorrow -will you have some of the best times of your life.  College is great. Many people have alot to bitch about, but ya know what..stop being miserable, stop bitching, grab a beer, and ROCK ON.. NOW is when you make your memories that you'll never tell your kids.   If you're still in college, make the most of it!
