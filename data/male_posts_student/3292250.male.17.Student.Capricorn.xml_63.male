Not my usual "I went to the mall today!" trip to the mall. I was with my little brother Josh, and my mother. So I couldn't wander around like I normally do and look for cute boys. But that's for the better anyways (see next post). We went to Lenscrafters because Mom needs new glasses and an eye exam, and so do I. So she was looking for some, and found some cute frames. I just looked, but didn't try anything on. She was to busy to give me an opinion on what I liked, and they sales guy had an annoying vibe about him. Not cute either. I think I saw some I like, but I'm probably going to wait until after the move just because that's probably when Mom will calm down enough to schedule an exam. She's talking about getting them Tuesday after I have a fucking physical at 8:30 in the morning. A physical, that I don't even see the point in, except for God knows Kansas will want one and  another  damn TB test, just like WV wanted. Like I'm going to contract TB between states. Anyways, she wants to look at Sam's Club for glasses too. I'm all for Sam's Club, but for glasses? Unless they have some amazingly cute ones, don't count on it Mom. I saw some I liked at the mall, and they were Armani, so that's what I want.  Going away from that long tangent, the movies were good.  The Stepford Wives  was good, and the acting was delivered by big stars (Matt Broderick, Nicole Kidman, Glenn Close, Miss M) who gave good performances. It was a little far-fetched, and the suspense didn't actually happen until the last 20 minutes, but it was good nonetheless.  Raising Hellen  was great. I love Kate Hudson and Joan Cusack anyways, so I'm a little biased. It was one of those movies that you either cry in or get teary. I was the latter, Mom the former. Anyways Josh is being annoying again and actually is forcing me off the computer at, lets see, 12 in the morning.
