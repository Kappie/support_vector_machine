Been hanging out mostly lately, not playing that many games, just chilling by a pool, I've gone to a few partys nothing big, and have had some summer flings, though Im thinking about going serious with some one soon. OK time to change the fuckin subject. UMMM yeah, nearly burnt my fuckin hand off on the fourth of July, but I had fun doing it. Yeah theres nothing much else to talk about so dont expect anymore posts from me til around August. Konichiwa Bitches
