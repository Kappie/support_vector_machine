The first part of the day i was working vbs, with 4-year olds........its fun, but they can be a hand full.........well two hand fulls, but its all good.  After that i found out i had to work so i went to work, almost lost my finger though, whew it was close.  After that i got to go out to eat with my family, including my little cousin, she can be really fun! Then i came back home and went to an incredable bible study that the most awesome lady i know is teaching(i love you mrs.janis). Its about this max lucado book called "Its Not About Me"..........seems to be a really cool book.  Once again thanks everyone for putting up with me! i love you all
