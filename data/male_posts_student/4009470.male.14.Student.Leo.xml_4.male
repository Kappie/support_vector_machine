We are all adjourned to the atriumwhichis quite packed.        First up is class 2A  in which we  don't even know  what the  heck  they are saying. They do notbother to speak into the mike and what we seearefour people beating up a person in class and in thetoilet ...  (lolz). Everybody cheers as we see the poor guy been bashed up and has his shirt pulled out and his genitals bashed ... ( oops! ) Also, none of the teacher can understand what is really happening.         The best (or most daring) skit is put up by class 2C in which we see a guy posing as  Aisha  (the Malaylady working with Sharon Xu) and another guy wearing a dress with  enhanced bosom using pear shaped balloons ! It is quite funny watching these two people working up and down and fighting to bring out the theme of racism and prejudice.  Chen Yuan Kang , a guy from 2K, comments that they should not have gotten to such extent even if there is a need to play the role of a girl but they  receive a standing ovation  at the beginning and the end of the play.         Also, this reminds me of plays during Shakespearean times in which women could not perform in plays at all as they will be looked down or considered to have low social status if they perform (sad right). Hence, maleactors will have to change costumes when necessary to act as women...          Ho Wen Jun's  acting skills really rock as he acts as a  kiasu middle-aged woman  coaching her son and making him do tons and tons of assessment books.   His etiquette and movements really resembles to that of a woman. He is really a born actor ...  Go Wen Jun, go!      As for our class, we most likely will be performing next week and hopefully it is enjoyable. The topic is "Unrealistic expectations of parents and teachers".
