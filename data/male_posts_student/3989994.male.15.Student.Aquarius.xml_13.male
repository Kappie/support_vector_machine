If we had not known better we would think that it would be the end of the world if their outfit made their thighs look 0.1 cm thicker than it's current 5cm! "aghhh i am so fat!". They have obviously not met msr Osman...She is so large she is solely responsible for the damage to the flooring in the school, not only that you seriously should see her car! It is lopsided to the drivers side. I'm not taking the mickey out of you, Seriously. It's really mean to say so but she seam to think she is going to drown any moment, getting all the safety gear...Her butt is seriously so filled with lard, she would float right to the top! Ok, enough of this Fat talk afterall fat is beautiful or so says some website dedicated to becoming obese!   What was i writting about again?  Morrow I've got a party to be going too, so can't wait to go. Have been waiting for quite some time actually. It's a birthday party of one of my friends and guess what i have not gotten him a present yet! i'll have got to drop by and get one before heading off to his place...   Outfits, once i said it was a women problem well i lied! I chose my outfit in like 5 seconds but terribly i cannot find anything to match my bandages around my leg...  Nothing serious (don't pretend ur concerned)   It happened so fast, they passed me the ball, i dribbled stumbled over it and fell. The fall was in slow motion...no it wasn't it was like....Boom. Awww... my leg hurts! whats worse about 10 minutes later while i was sitting watching the others kick the ball around... It starts to Rain and blooming heavy it rained.   Wet,hurt and filled with rubbish...i wrote this post.   You know you love me.
