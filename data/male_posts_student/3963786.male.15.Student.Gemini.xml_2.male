But I just had to try to let her know how I was feeling, maybe help her realize how strongly I felt, and still feel, about her. Me and her talked for hours and I don't know if it helped any or if it got her feeling any better, but near the end there was a comment that I'm kind of hoping wasn't for real. I don't want her to like me, and I do want her to like me, eventually one side of me will win, and I think it's going to be the latter.... I just want to make it clear that despite someone else reading this, everything I say in it will be true, I will not let myself lie about how I feel just so that someone might find it to be easier to cope with. If someone else ever reads this again. (Which doesn't seem that farfetched since within 2 weeks I've already let Nikki read it.) "Why can't I appreciate the things that are dearest to me until I've lost them." I don't know who said that, but it's nothing but the truth.
