Me, thinking they're just another group of girls headed for the door, try to not pay attention and possibly move out of the way. They weren't headed for the door. They stop and start talking to me.*what did I do to deserve this? It's not my Birthday.* So, this group of like 8 really cute girls are talkin' to me because I looked lonely*\/\/007! Loneliness prevails!* Then a slow dance comes and one asks me to dance.*MORE \/\/007!* We dance. Dance ends. I go to find my "evil friends".*don't ask* One of my previous friends, who's pretty hott herself, comes up and hugs me good-bye. Then the group of girls comes back and they call give me hugs good-bye. We're walking to the car, and the group of girls comes back. This time they ask for my phone number! I give it. I'm not an idiot! We go home. I'm here now, still dazed by my awesome luck.  Now that I have said all the good stuff, here's come the unfortunate bad....  I'm so damn lonely. Sure, I have lots of friends, lots of really  AWESOME  friends. Yet, I always long for more companionship. I HAD companionship, but I kinda fucked that up with Keli. damn.  Oh well, life will always go on. Peace Out!  Spense
