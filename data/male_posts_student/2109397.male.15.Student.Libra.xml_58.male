The 2 newbies as I like to call them both had trouble understanding it. You're lucky I don't disown you because 28 Days Later is like a test to see if you can be friends with me. Or at least I should make it be one. But who'd want to be friends with me anyways right?  Yea I entertained a guest on Wednesday or was it Tuesday. Went to a soccer game hollerd at some people and got free pizza. Then I think my house bored him to death. So yea prolly never see that kid over here again. We got some movies, was about to rent 28 Days Later and then thought hey why dont I just buy it. So I did and now I own a movie. Just seemed to not entertain the kid tho, musta been a comedy person. We did get Eurotrip which was mildly entertaining. Previews ruined a lot of the stuff.  I also seen Day After Tomorrow wit Chelski and Derk. Twas a good movie. It was weird cuz the last movie I saw (Elf) which was 3 or 4 months previous, I saw the preview for Day After Tomorrow and said I want to see that. And turns out it was the next movie I saw. (I thought it was amusing). There was this one part that was funny though in the movie but absolutely no one thought it was, I guess maybe it wasnt a joke or something but I was laughin hard and no one else gave it a thought but Chelsea laughed after I was laughing for awhile.  Yea, err so people annoy me a lot. A lot of people annoy me a lot. But yea, theres this one Rugrats episode where Phil and Lil were like you know the more time you spend with each other youll end up hating each other? Well I think that is kinda true. It happens all the fucking fuck time. So yes.  I hate the way things turn out. Period. Just period.  Me and Derk, got into this fight with Chelseas X Kevin. And it was very fun in fact I think I posted it below or maybe I am lying.
