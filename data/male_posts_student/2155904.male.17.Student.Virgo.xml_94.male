His speech went by alright.  he somehow bullshitted for like at least 7 minutes and still could have said more stuff but he didn't need to.  Tomorrow he just needs to answer some questions and such.  But that should be pretty easy cuz they are on a time limit.  And time limits are Tyke's friend.  In most cases.  Except when it is like somebody saying, "You have one minute to hang out with me" or "You have 2 hours where I will be free to hang out with you so make it fun."  That is so hard to do.  Tyke can't just make up things to do.  Although the game of Chinko can definitely be an insanely fun game.  They keep adding amendments to the Chinko Constitution though so as to make the game better and better.  Tyke got a Derek on his physics final and a Chris in the class but thats ok.  He will get a horrible GPA so he might as well have 3 terrible grades.  If you're gonna fuck up, might as well do it in a bunch of classes at once!  That way you get everything out of the way at once.  Rather than spacing out the pain and drama.  Wow, not much to talk about in today's blog.  Don't worry, he is still going to write the normal amount but he just doesn't know what he is going to write about yet as often he has some idea of what he can say.  Kinda like a preliminary little plan in his head of what to say.  An outline would be the "technical term" for what it is.  Really, it is just him mapping out ideas in his mind.  No wonder they call them mind-maps.  Wow, who knew???  There is one subject Tyke could spend some time talking about but he won't.  It is stupid.  And trivial.  Its just that Purdy made a bit of a deal out of it so Tyke had to stay strong and not lie.  And he didn't lie.  He isn't lying.  Truly.  He swears on anything you want him to swear on.  Since he doesn't believe in that shit he can swear on anything.  He'll swear on anybody's life.  His own, his parents', his brother's, anyone.  Just ask him to tomorrow and he'll do it.  But basically, his point in bringing up this subject is that he wants everyone to know that he doesn't lie about things like this.  He lies pretty frequently, yes.  But for other things.  Like to cover his ass, or to make himself not look like an idiot in front of a lot of people who would just incessantly ridicule him.  And it isn't to avoid the embarassment of the ridicule so much as the annoyance of taking the time out to ridicule him rather than talk about something fun.  BUT, he doesn't lie about things like this.  He may lie at first but if keeps insisting he isn't lying then he isn't.  His lies are concise and consist of great brevity so as to enhance the believability.  Tyke has basically revealed a bunch of secrets about him in the blog for the pure reason of entertainment and that he had nothing else to talk about.  But so far that hasn't created a problem so it doesn't matter.  In the future, things could change.  But you know what, Tyke has been thinking about college some.  Not just college but his blog in college.  He hopes that he keeps doing it then.  And also he hopes he can do it while he is in Europe this summer.  It will only be 2 weeks but that is a long time not to see anyone he wants to see.  And he is not looking forward to summer in a way.  Just cuz he never has gotten to see the people that he wants to see.  Or at least not often.  Like Tina for instance.  Or Purdy and Dotti last year.  Not until one of the last days did he hang out with Purdy.  And Dotti didn't even get to participate in the festivities so it wasn't as cool as it could have been.  Tyke loves how Dotti loves how Tyke smells.  Nothing like that feeling.  Mainly cuz it is just a unique feeling.  But it feels good.  If only every girl felt that way.  But then the uniquity (coined form of unique) of the feeling wouldn't be there and it would be less pleasing.  He has thought about that idea already tonight.  Like 49 seconds ago.  He was responding to Skippy's away message which was "Why all this drama" and Tyke responded with this: cuz without drama the high moments wouldn't be as high and we would basically be living in a social state where instead of having highs and lows we just had variations of the middle.  It was meant to just be sorta funny as he answered what was prolly a rhetorical question but he did it anyway.  And it does have its point.  Cuz really, the pain, anguish, and disappointment keeps the ecstacy of other feelings to a higher level.  All of this seems so obvious to Tyke that he feels there is no reason to even type it though.  That is one problem with his advice.  He hates how it seems so simple and bland.  He really wants to make up something paradoxical or highly intellectual that nobody has thought of before but that just isn't possible.  So instead he talks about his 5th grade romances.  But in the end, it all comes back to the times you passed by.  No it doesn't.  Or does it?  Tyke thinks it doesn't.  So that means it doesn't.  It all comes down to looks.  No, that isn't right.  Personality?  No.  Ohhhhh, Tyke knows.  It comes down to your willingness to divulge all your feelings.  Well, if it is...then Tyke is in GREAT SHAPE.  Time to go do some crunches yo.
