It's mostly because I'm wrapping up my time in Chapel Hill and preparing to move back to the northeast, but it's also because I've been wicked busy.    I saw  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  I really liked it, but a few things about it made me uncomfortable.  The first thing was the audience.  It really gets my hackles up when people applaud during the movie, unless it's some sort of screening or premiere where people involved with the film were actually there.  Otherwise, who're you clapping for?  The projectionist?  Some people couldn't restrain themselves, clapping during the movie.  To me, it's as rude as talking or answering your cell phone at a film.  That's me.  The other problem I had was the manipulativeness of the film and its tendency to push things a little bit too far.  Ty Burr of the Boston Globe  urlLink explains this  better than I can:  "With the death of Lipscomb's son in Iraq, Moore himself turns exploiter. Her grief, of course, is genuine. So is our response to it. But when Moore prompts her to read her son's final letter out loud, and she cries helplessly as she does so, it becomes clear that the filmmaker's intrusiveness knows no bounds, and that he would sacrifice the dignity of even his beloved Flintians for political theater."  Too true.  All in all, I highly recommend it.  On the Michael Moore tip, I've bought (for $8 at  urlLink The Bookshop  in Chapel Hill, one of my favorite stores in the area)  Stupid White Men .  So far, no good (as a friend once noted of a book by Terry Eagleton, "No stars.  Pure Toilet.").  I don't appreciate being yelled at, and I certainly don't appreciate being yelled at by a book I want to agree with.  Michael Moore, at least as a writer, doesn't seem to respect his audience enough to show them where he gets his information and to lay off the rhetoric.  It's insulting.  Maybe it will get better.  I hope it does.  But so far, it's far less appealing and interesting to me than either of Molly Ivins's books,  Shrub  and  Bushwhacked , or Al Franken's  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them , both of which are funny, sharp, and, to me, convincing, without being excessively polemical.  Moore could learn a lot from either of them (particularly Ivins in the latter book where she proposes solutions to problems -- something I liked very much).  In other news, a Florida teacher has been  urlLink arrested for having sex with a fourteen-year-old student  three times -- once in her classroom, once at her home, once in the back seat of her SUV while his fifteen-year-old cousin drove.  She's a fairly screwed up young woman, that much is clear, and this is sure to damage the kid she slept with.  I want to know what the hell was going on in his cousin's mind when he agreed to play chauffeur.  How do ask someone that, and why would they agree?  I'm not even going to comment about the outfit she's wearing in the AP photo.    According to a  urlLink new study , approximately ten percent of students are subjected to some form of sexual misconduct between kindergarten and grade 12.  Makes you wonder how many people are doing this and not getting caught.  I found two other articles at CNN.com about improper student-teacher relationships/interactions in the last week ( urlLink VA Teacher  Child Porn ,  urlLink Softball Coach  Player ).  That's all pretty damn screwed up.  In better, happier news, I've picked up the Beastie's new album,  To the 5 Boroughs .  It's slick and listenable.  Somewhat reminiscent of U2's  All That You Can't Leave Behind  in it's quality of production and, unfortunately, in its conservativeness.  It's a very well done and very safe album, particularly when you compare it to  Hello Nasty , which has a different sort of energy to it while still being a great album.  So, in the end, I guess you could say it's good, but it's not even close to being a  Paul's Botique , even though it's something of a return to that album's sound (especially in its use of samples).
