Haha, I'm like an addict already and tt isn't a good thing at all.  I was basically gambling frm 3pm to 8pm. I did win, but once again not as much as the previous two times. It seems tt I'm losing my touch or smt. Haha, I hope I won't win any lesser frm now on. I juz wanna earn more and keep the money in my new piggy bank! L0L! Well, I realised tt I actually haf enough cash now to get some ppl their b'dae presents. But if I actually do den I'll probably be left wif nothing. This Euro 04 is oso the time to earn money. Haha, I'm hoping to earn at least $100 after Euro 04 is over. Well, I'll probably gif some1 a treat after today's winnings. Den again, I might juz save the money or buy some b'dae presents.  I'm juz waiting for the matches tonight to begin. There are two matches, the first is Croatia against Switzerland. I'm definitely rooting for the Croatians to win this one. As for the second match, it's England against France. Apparently, my bet is on England! U can't go wrong wif the underdogs! L0L! I juz do not wan France to win, and my gut tells me tt England is gonna pull this off. I'll update all of u on both the results after the matches. Till den, I'll cya around! =]
