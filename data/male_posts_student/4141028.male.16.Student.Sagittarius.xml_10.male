Yesterday was my last day at ASS and boy...awkward.  I had to explain atleast 100 times to teachers and friends why I was leaving.  I should have just recorded it and played the tape when badgered about it.  The principal, Mrs. Wilson, was probably the worst.  She was bent on convincing me that I should stay.  She asked me why an dI said, very politely, that "I just feel like the school is still in a transitional faze and I don't care for it."  She said they weren't.    WTF!?!  The school isn't done!  There are 5 or 6 classrooms in a trailer park beside the gym (which also isn't finished).  There are teachers that don't have classrooms and have to lug around their school supplies and such on a cart from room to room...all that seems pretty transitional.  However, I didn't have the time to sit around and argue with her.    Today I have much of nothing planned.  I'm going into the workplace @ 4:30.  That's about it.  I might buy an Icee or something.  I have to get crap ready for Schley, too.  I care.
