It had nothing to do with the U.S. Government and it supposedly costed a fraction less than what NASA pays to put a man into space.  This whole thing is supposed to work towards researching the possibility of space tourism.  I think this is a pretty cool idea, to send people to space for money.  But the cost is incredible, you have to be some kinda rich to be able to buy a ride to space.  Costs are predicted to be about $100,000.  Keep in mind this is in the next 50 years as well, because the technology is not ready for "regular consumer use."  What regular consumer has $100,000 to spend to go to outer space?  For $100,000 dollars, here's what you get.        - A 90 minute space ship ride that is extremely demanding physically.       - About 3 minutes of actual space time.       - Possibility of death.       - A package of M's to throw around, in case you get bored while your there.       - You will be famous for a few days.    I like the idea...if anyone has some spare money they'd like to give me so I can enjoy a trip to outer space, you can contact me at nicklasvishnov@netscape.net.  P.S. - Prices are predicted to decrease DRASTICALLY after the introduction of high capacity spacecraft.  Prices are supposed to be in the $40,000 range.  At least we have something to look forward to.
