I would rather do homework than listen to some old person raddle off rules and polices. By 7th period I was sick to my stomach from boardium and heat.   It's nice to see friends and people you haven't seen in a while. It is werid seeing little freshman running around noing you was once one of them.   I have found out that I will spend last period working on computers! Yep-he. The best part is, the room is air conditioned!!! I guess I will be helping the techies by doing little things like fixing computers and printers. Better than sitting in study hall (with 150 people in a small room it gets a little toasty).   Working on a hot debet going on at  urlLink Leoville  about a Cat's butt ( urlLink Cat  is the co-host of  urlLink Call For Help  on  urlLink TechTV ). I can't belive how people put down other people like that. It's soo rude!  urlLink Do check out the picture though . She has a cute skirt that has a eye (I) a bee (B) and a M (M) -- what's that spell IBM!! Sound like a cheerleader over here.   In till the next blog session, Blog LATER!!!
