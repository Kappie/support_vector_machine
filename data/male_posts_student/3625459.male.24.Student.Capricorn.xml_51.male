All I can think of is lyrics from Queensryche's song "There is so much more I can be”Really loud party music slamming in hard from the part hall nearby, every one seems to be having a good time. "Two words that don’t make sense" (to me)Things weren’t supposed to work out this way. I did go to work today, it sucked. but I wasn’t as bored as I was last time. I hate doing omni surveys they always suck. Somehow this time around it wasn’t that bad probably because we had24 minutes of training. Treated myself to a pizza, well as much as I could afford though a 10" margarita, the best I’ve had so far. Don’t know just felt like having one so I did.   I did get to meet the supervisor, got to finish that thing soon and be on my way.   There’s something that still keeps me going,it’s not much but its all I have. One last bit, kinda like the last brown autumnleaf clinging onto a tree. It’s all I’ve got, and I’m holding on to it, wishing on it ... I don’t know how it’s all going to turn out.
