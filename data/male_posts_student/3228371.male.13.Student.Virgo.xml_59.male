However, I did buy some cool spaghetti strap tops, tank tops, jackets, and a pair of cool skateboarding short-ish pants things. Bumped into Azra at Urban Planet and we said hi. Got my sister 3 jackets (2 blue, 1 grey) and I fell madly in love with a light blue COWBOY HAT! It costed $30. I had $20 on me and didn't have enough. My mommy looked like she was willing to buy it for me since it looked pretty nice... especially with my outfit today [grey spaghetti strap, blue jeans, checkered blue jacket tied around my waist] but she said that if she got that for me, then it'd be my birthday present and she won't get anything else for my birthday. I changed my mind because I'd still rather have an electric guitar. I'm not as in love with the guitar as the cowboy hat but I thought about it and knew it was better in the long run. I could use the guitar and praise the name of the LORD through music and it's better for my musical education than just my appearance. *sighzZ* I guess I'll just save up $10 more and then go to Promenade to get it. I've been wanting to get a cowboy hat when I was 3 years old! Damn, I ain't gonna give up this opportunity! It's so cool! I've been here last year and I've been eyeing that hat already! *sighzZ* Soon... soon.   Got back from shopping and went on MSN. Talked to Vivo and she said she went outside with Mark, Nima, Alice, Safee, Octi, and Jordan. I'm surprised they only sat around playing Truth or Dare. She told me Nima kissed Mark and Safee on the cheek. Gross... Seriously. I love this guy but it's a total turn-off when he kisses his guy friends. I'm NOT kidding...! I was about to  PUKE  when I read that he kissed them. If he kissed some girl then I'd just get pissed but kissing his guy friends... ewness. I know it's probably a dare but... ew. Did I say ew? I'm sorry, I mean   EWWWWWWWW  ! *choke choke gag gag puke*   Let's change the topic before I lose my lunch... I need my appetite for dinner. Well, yesterday I did some stuff... Hmm, speaking of yesterday, I'd better also blog about last night at Bethel.   Okay, last night at Bethel, we made sushi! It was a lot of fun. We talked, joked, and made sushi! Totally cool. All Martin and Brian did was eat the leftovers and the odd ends of the sushis. I didn't really know much about making sushi so I helped skin the cucumber, chop it up, and made 1 roll of sushi and stopped. I ended up just helping out here and there and joking around with Martin and Brian. Yelled at Martin as usual and Brian jokingly dissed me [as usual] and I sprayed water at him. Instead, I ended up cupping my hand and filling it with water, then I just threw a lot of water on him, making him ALL wet! Haha! Funnyness. Auntie Amy just sat there and laughed her head off. It was soo funny! I got some on Martin too. Hilarious. I think the water thing all started when Brian wiped something on my arm. Haha! Oh well, as long as we all had fun. We ended up finishing our designs and team 1 won! Oh well. We sat together and ate it all up. Kenneth [Wilfred's bro] kept coming to have a few sushis while playing basketball. Oh... I just remembered... I wanna ask Brian Y. for a copy of our sushi. He took a pic of our sushi with his cell. Joanna keeps coming to Bethel now because she wants to see Derek. She thinks he's cute...! Haha! Funnyness. So yeah... I didn't like the shirt that Sally had on. Made her look like a ho. Talked to Zoe in the washroom and I told her some stuff. *cough* Same with Priss. Well, talked to Priss outside though...   This morning at Chinese school, Vivo wasn't there! Haha... not surprised. Jeff got switched to the back and ended up sitting behind us. Him and Janice. They had to do their exams. Muahahaha! Suckerssss~! JkzZ~! We helped Jeff cheat a bit since he's a nice guy anyway and we messed around with his cap. Lmao! Hat hair!!! Looks HILARIOUS without his cap. So yeah... Talked to Zoe a bit today at Chinese school and Yvonne came late. Auntie Yvonne~ Hee hee!  *sighzZ* Can't get my mind off the cowboy hat! >O  Geez, I'm so tired. Too lazy to get up and take a shower yet. I'll go later. Still feeling a bit unwell from what Vivo told me. Gross...   Konica wants me to show her what I got at the mall through webcam but I'm too lazy to get the stuff outta the bag... I don't wanna do webcam today... Not in the mood for anything. Miss my cowboy hat too much.  Got some stuff to think over... Blog later... It might be in SD, might not. Whatever. I'll see...   『 Debating Against My Conscience 』
