I had invited my then-girlfriend over, for the sake of putting her in an uncomfortable position, as she hated eating dinner with my folks. We chowed, and I, being the fat tub of shit I was at the time, ate a ton. The tails of the lobster had an odd texture--stringy and tough. They probably weren't cooked enough, but that didn't stop me from eating them. Post-gurgitation, we decided to do what seemed like every single person with a means of transportation decided to do that night-- visit the Regal Cinema megaplex. After waiting in line the four of us got tickets to see About Schmitt, staring one of the finest actors in the history of cinema, Jack Nicholson. So, we get into the theater and, naturally, my parents and my girlfriend and I separate. The 'rents take to the lower theater and the girlfriend and I motion our way up to the top (this theater had stadium seating). We find ourselves at the top row, which is completely empty, and she takes the inside, her left shoulder to a wall. I take my seat next to hers and prepare for the movie. There is a slight gurgle in my stomach but I feel that if it is ignored it wont bother me the rest of the night. After a short wait the movie starts and I fix my eyes to the screen... It's getting quite hot in here... The movie picks up and I'm enjoying it... here comes that *gurgle* *gurgle* again... I start to sweat as pull my thick sweater off and preemptively cover my lap with it to dampen the deadly farts, which I can feel coming. Maybe that's all it is, I say to myself reassuringly as I release the first blasts of radioactivity from the depths of my gurgling stomach. The movie progresses, and so does my gastro-intestinal situation. What was once just discomfort now evolved into pain, a tolerable pain, but a pain nonetheless. As the forty-five minute mark passes all hell is unleashed in my stomach. That's it, I say to myself, I have to shit and nothing is going to stop me! I turn to my right to get up and exit the theater, and what do I see but five ENORMOUS, overweight black people. These were big motherfuckers, and there were at least five of them blocking my way out of what I now saw to be a packed theater. Even if I got them to stand up so I could leave their guts would have been too large to let me pass. So, thinking that I only had about forty-five more minutes left of the movie, I decide to tough it out (more like I was obligated to). My habitually taciturn tract of intestine comes alive as the lobster gets his revenge. My Stomach, growing angrier now, moans like a banshee as I dance about my seat-- stuck-- between a wall and five soft places-- stuck. The cauldron of hell churns, froths, and bubbles in my gut as I writhe in indescribable agony. By now I have no doubt turned green with sickness, and as each second passes I grow more and more impatient. The sweat on my forehead is beyond the beading point. It pours out profusely, salting my eyes as I visualize myself as king on my porcelain throneâ€¦ I concede to myself that I may not be able to win this. I may be left with no other choice than to let loose where I sit. I felt defeated, but I still had fight in me yet. 100 minutes up... When will this movie end? I don't even know what the movie was about, as I could not have paid any mind to it. Had I diverted my attention my seat would have caught fire as the volcanic death of my core unleashed its fiery being. I absolve a few boiling breaths of sulfuric crustacean to the tin-bottomed seat beneath me, toxic-breaths of which, if introduced to flame, would undoubtedly beset an unbreakable weld a'tween my cheeks. 125 minutes and the film finally ends. I suspect it was great, as there was an ill reaction from the crowd of fat idiots who surely only went there to occupy ninety minutes of their time. I pray for everyone to stand and exit the theater as fast as they possibly can as I attempt to take to my legs while not allowing the lobster to gain the upper hand (I was wearing my favorite pair of pants-- green moleskins-- and I'd be damned if I were to let the lobster beat me and claim them as his own!)... Blast! Just as I feared, the bathrooms were all full. So I tell my crew to fly! To the minivan! As fast as you can possibly move, you all must get me home!  My clothes are saturated with the toxic sweat that is now flooding its way out of the pores on my livid face. The sickness is almost unbearable now and I slip in and out of a poison-green dysphoria. I grind my teeth as I breathe the hot, recycled, food-scented minivan air. Finally! We make it home. The lobster in my belly has not managed to claw itself out yet. Oh, what a wretched pain! I stumble my way up the heavily trodden oak staircase, nearly pulling the railing out of its bearings on my way. I reach the summit of the mighty mountain of stairs and kick open the door to the bathroom with my already bare feet. I strip naked at ludicrous speed and enthrone my seething red body on the cool enamel seat. At last my ordeal is over! I brace myself, drawing a breath and entering a dreamlike state of near-meditation. NOW! I unleash the fury! ---  The coup de grace:  I lift my disrobed body off of my cool, pale friend, and apologize for the burden I have bestowed upon him. It was all now a surreal memory, taking material form only in the black, star-speckled vastness of space, which my porcelain throne, served as an ocular to. My ordeal was over. I emerged triumphant. I lay my weary hand on my silver sword and watch as the dark matter spirals away into infinity. I was the victor, but I still await the day when my adversary confronts me again, for now I am prepared. I have pepto bismol, and I sit in the aisle seat. The Lobster will not stand a chance next time.
