This is too bad, because I am a big fan of Kimmel's work from  Win Ben Stein's Money , and especially his friend Adam Carolla of  urlLink Loveline  fame.  Kimmel was incredibly nervous; his best moment was an ad-lib of a Jon Gruden interview gone wrong, and the only saving grace of the show was an inspired performance by  Coldplay .  The guests got little love, things ran on and on and on...this is stuff that gets fixed over time.  But Kimmel didn't look comfortable...it wasn't him.  The guy sitting at the desk looked like a mindless schmuck forced to ask questions and play host...if this is the Jimmy Kimmel show, I want to see the fool-hearted, dirty comedian, not a puppet dabbling in risque topics.  Hopefully he loosens up.  Otherwise, it's back to Page 2 for Bill Simmons.    Of course, the true disappointment of this week is that a friend is taping  urlLink Joe Millionaire  for me to watch after I get out of my night class.  This is so I can watch the show rather than hear who he kicks off...nothing worse than that morning cooler commentary of something you missed.  But that I would even regret missing this show is throwing into serious consideration my stature as someone worth knowing.    Saw an interesting film this week:  urlLink The Trial of Henry Kissinger .  The movie makes the same case that the book of the same name makes; that diplomat and 60s cosmopolitan Henry Kissinger should be brought up in front of an international tribunal for war crimes; the overarching theme resonates that Americans should not live a life without responsibility where they can act one way and not have to pay for it.  The movie is pretty tame by my standards, but that makes sense, considering Kissinger doesn't get out much these days, so editors were forced to use stock footage from the 60s and voice-overs of Kissinger cabinet members and journalists.  Imagine trying to get Kissinger to help you film this:    "Henry?  Hey, this is Eugene Jarecki from the BBC."   "Hello Eugene."   "Hey, I was wondering if you could help me out a bit.  Some friends and I are putting together a documentary where we investigate your role in the Nixon and Ford administrations as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State."   "Is that true?"   "Why yes it is. We want to show how you helped facilitate an extra five years of the Vietnam War in order to gain political clout, as well as bomb a neutral country, sell arms to a country you knew was going to slaughter hundereds of thousands of its own citizens, and pave the way for a coup against a country whose government in power posed no threat to the United States."   "That sounds interesting."   "The goal of this is to show that you are no different from Augusto Pinochet (the man you brought to power in Chile), Idi Amin, or Slobodon Milosevic.  We hope that this will spur you to be brought up on charges of war crimes in front of an international tribunal."     "Well, I am busy this week.  Perhaps lunch at the Johnny Rockets off 42nd next Tuesday?"   "Great.  See you at noon."  My father used to regail me with many a story about Henry Kissinger, and his red-eye flights around the world, all in the name of diplomacy.  This man was a hero, what men were made of, he was a throwback to a better day.  And he had a Monty Python song written about him.  I am quite sure that my dad would find the notion of Kissinger a criminal as preposterous.  And so does Kissinger.  Kissinger says that he bombed Cambodia because it was under the auspices of North Vietnam (not true), that he had nothing to do with the rise to power of Augusto Pinochet, and that his double-agent tactics cost the US and Vietnam a peace treaty in 1968.  But at the same time, my dad would say to me that he is not an alcoholic.  Who do I believe:  the man himself, who speaks in the interest of self-preservation, or those who worked with him and thus saw his motives first-hand?
