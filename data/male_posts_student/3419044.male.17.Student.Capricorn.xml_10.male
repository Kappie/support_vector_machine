Well, now that I have a blog, I have abso-fucking-lutely nothing to say.  :(    As you know, if you read my first post, doubtful... but as you know, I was up late last night.  Oh say... 3-ish.  I had to wake up and go to the sweatshop (work) this morning.  All week I had been dreading going to work.  Not to sure why, I just wanted a long weekend where I had nothing to think about or worry about, I suppose.  But, once I got there, alittle tired, I realized that my job is quite good.  I am fortunate to have the job I do.  For you people who are dumb and shouldn't have been reading this because you don't know me, I work at a computer store, Legacy Computers/Radio Shack.  The ... (10 minutes later...) Yeah, OK I am easily distracted, MSN (the best procrastination tool of all), eBay, SV650.org, Winamp, just to name a few, distracted me for a couple minutes.  Anyways... The... morning was fairly quiet.  This meant I got to fix computers.  Little spyware issues.  I hate you spyware... (glare)  But then again, if it wasn't for spyware my job wouldn't exist.  So, I would like to thank spyware for providing me with a job.  Secondly, I would like to thank Spybot: S and HijackThis! for making my job that much easier.  I would I went for my 30 minute lunch break and arrived to a busy store.  Some lady, not to mention anynames... phoned in the afternoon.  Wanted someone to come over and fix her computer right away!  I said Rob was busy at the moment and I will leave a message for him to get back to her.  (Rob is my boss, more like... yeah boss, but real nice boss.)  So anyways... (15 minutes later, distracted by HijackThis!)... Hmm now I am all ugly registry free I guess... :S  SO ANYWAYS, at work, I gave Rob the message.  At this point the store was busy.  He told me to call her back and say today is not an option to come over but he will for sure go there Tuesday.  He also said, if she sounded angry to offer and say he'd be willing to meet her there on Monday or Tuesday afternoon.  I called her back and she was the biggest bitch to me.  "I've bought this this and this from there I think I deserve the service."  I try to tell her that she can meet with him Sunday or Monday and she persists on cutting me off!  Saying "I bought all this." and "I will get my husband to talk to him then."  I finally got it through and she threatens me with, "I will get my husband to call him."  I kinda wanted to punch her in the face.  'Cause Rob does not sell shy of service, he knows all his customers on a personal note and is very accomodating. (7 hours later, I went out...)  So as it turned out, Rob had to go over their, being the good man he is, and fixed it for her.  I held 'fort' all by myself.  I sold some items, helped people out, felt good.  Nerve racking, but good.  The rest of the day went well, fixed some more computers, had the odd customer come in, talked with Rob.  It was well.    After work I came home and had tacos for dinner.  Then after that Laura, popped over for abit. Then Chris, Kent, and Jeremy, THEN we went to the Big House to see Sarah and after that... drove around, got pulled over.  Talked to some drunk/stoned people in my school... then... went to Kent's, hung out there.  Not alot, not uneventful night, better than most.  Well, yet again, I have managed to stay up till 3:30 to post.  I think I will wrap this up and see what I have tp write for my next post... Hm... I better start thinking... :D
