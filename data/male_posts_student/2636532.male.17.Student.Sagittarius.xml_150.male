I mean I DO want to go home, i miss it and i can't help it. And people there miss me too, even my dogs are lost without me there so i'm told. but then i'll miss being here too, i mean i've met TONS of new people although some of them i've talked to long before i ever saw them in person. And i've had a blast even when i was doing nothing more then watching tv with louis. I mean i hadn't seen him in over 4 years and the last 2 weeks have been great. but there's the dependability of home, the people that i've been with for years that know me the best. it's strange...although i may get to see louis again if he comes out to Alberta in the fall. but now i must go and make sure that i'm bringing everything with me that i brought here. -Matt
