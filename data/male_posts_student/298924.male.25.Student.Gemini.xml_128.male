He never had the surgery....long story short they had some problems making sure he was able to breath adequately while anesthized...when he came to after not having anything done he was kind of upset, but other than that he is fine....I appreciate all of the well wishes and prayers....it meant (and still does mean) alot to me and my family....  I feel very blessed in the fact that I have so many quality associations and friends....  In other news, I made what I thought to be an easy test for my class to take while I was away.....turns out it was not so easy as the class average was a 16.1 out of 25....I'm at my wits end because the hardest question on the test was a 10th grade level question....I wasn't trying to humble anyone or break any backs....I want these people to do well and get into med school....I'm going to try some suggestions that my mother gave me....  Flipping the script.....I am starting to think that I just cannot read women's signals....I am certain that there are a couple of ladies around here who are feeling me but I haven't picked up on any of the signals at all....it's like I'm blind to them....or maybe my mind is elsewhere with some other unresolved feelings....I'm not entirely sure....I know for certain that I feel very strongly about a woman that I know, but the time and other circumstances are not right for me to make a move on it....  Life is all about the tough decisions....one of these days I'm going to have to hop off of the fence into one yard or another....just not yet....
