I've been waiting for the cable guy to hook up my powerlink at Will and I's apartment all week. So guess who I saw today? I was wondering who actually bought those things. Now I know. That's just way, way, way too funny. A friggin Jetta VR6 has more power than those "trucks." And doesn't look quite so gay. Even a chick just looks like a tomboy who doesn't quite get it. Especially while flicking her butt out the window. Every single friend I have now is an ex-smoker. Most run or bike several miles a day. I lift weights, rollerblade, and hike so I'm getting there too. So I guess I haven't bought a car yet, although I now own two '95 compacts. The best things in life  are  free. And I'm moving to Burlington with my girl/friend to finish college and make $1000/week at the same time. But I'll tell you about all that later. My life is extremely stable  and  I still have my identity.
