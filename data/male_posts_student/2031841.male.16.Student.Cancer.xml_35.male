Just awhile back I changed my email from a long string of numbers and letters to a short, crisp name: Natoryy.  If I change again, it could be annoying for people.  Think of all the emails I'd have to send, all the sites I'd have to inform of my address.  Plus, I still check my old email now and then to make sure I didn't get anything there that I need to see.  If I switch to G-Mail, I'd have three addresses to check and at different sites no less.  Plus, G-Mail just isn't as user friendly, isn't as nice.  So the choice seems obvious, right?  Wrong.  Google is so cool...The little guy standing up to the big corporation: Yahoo.  Plus, Google, I hear, may be having money troubles.  I oughtta support them, a cool site, with my hits.  But then, the people who own Google are rich enough as it is...I don't need to worry about them since I don't even know them.  Plus, Yahoo has feelings as well.    For now, Yahoo will stay my home.  I have a Google account set up for later if I ever need it.  Currently, though, change is looking to be a bad thing.  At least in the case of email.  Anyway, that's my take on things.
