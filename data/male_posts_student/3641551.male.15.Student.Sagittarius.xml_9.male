Well I will elaborate further in my next few blogs, but in a nutshell...  The end of EURO 2004 and also the end of my fortune..  The start of school and also the start of homework..  The start of COPA America and also the start of my phobia towards nails..  The start of my drinking habit and my aknowledgement of my stupid big mouth..  My new found love for playing goalkeeper and my other love ???  There is of course much more but this will have to do. (in the meantime)   Regards, B.C aka Star_Of_Light
