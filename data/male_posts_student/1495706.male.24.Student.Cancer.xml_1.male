Neat!  What would be good to rant about today...  Today I defended Bush.  I didn't want to do it, I don't feel good about having done it, but there it is- I defended Bush.  There was a discussion about the intelligence surrounding 9/11 and I suggested that it would've happened no matter what because it was such an implausible scenario.  So maybe he shouldn't get flak for it and we should just move forward with the process of learning from the mistake of allowing him to have power.  Y'know, like we learned from Nixon.  And Hitler.  Really, what would the lesson be from this if there was an intelligence lapse?  It would be that we should get hyper-vigilant every time anybody overheard anything that might be a threat, and we do that already (in theory- nothing rallies support like a good scare!) so it seems a bit...redundant to have more justification.  I also think it's time to rant about the FCC, because nobody seems to get the irony of fighting a war in the name of freedom while encouraging censorship because of Janet Jackson's all-powerful nipple and I'm a little peeved.  And I wish someone would enlighten me, cause I don't get it- how does the TV have such power?  I would think the easiest way to not be offended is to turn the television off.  Or you could, y'know, not own a tv set.    I'd like to suggest that if people aren't smart or capable enough to regulate their own viewing (or regulate for their children, God forbid parents actually pay attention to the Ritalin-filled little monsters) then we should give up this whole democracy thing.  See, that was sort of based on this notion that people weren't complete morons who needed the love and support of an authoritarian ruler chosen by God or, y'know, having killed the last authoritarian ruler.  But that was before anyone knew how it would function and now that we have some evidence maybe we should revise the concept.  Besides, you know that as long as people can get all the stuff they want they don't care what else is going on.    Or maybe we can introduce some kind of limit factor so not everyone has a chance to vote.  Like, we could setup fake voting where people think they're actually making a choice but the winner could be predetermined.  Oh wait we have that.  It's that electronic voting thing co-sponsored by friends of Bush, I believe.  Whatever, I'm in grad school.  Which means I don't have to come up with anything practical, I can just bullshit about the theories using big words (instantiate!) and complicated sentences.  Here's a fun contradiction:  Homegirl the professor raved about the beauty of nuanced arguments.  She ended the class explaining why a nuanced argument was meaningless and therefore the concept it supported should be dismissed.  I love contradictions!  Back to the rant: So maybe we could just stop voting entirely.  That money could be used to pay for something useful.  Like universal healthcare.  Or my student loans.    Damn that killed lots of time.  I'm pleased.  Maybe I'll start using this thing.
