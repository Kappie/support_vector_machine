And then those women raise men who won't respect anybody. Okay, so maybe it's not as bad as all that. But I can't stand seeing the way guys my age treat girls. If a guy's hands aren't all over them, his eyes are. And girls not only allow them to do it, they encourage it. If there was more intelligible dialogue between teenage guys and girls, it would go something like this: Guy: "What's your name?" Girl: "Hee hee." Guy: "Sweet. Would you like a superficial relationship in which I will disrespect you physically, mentally, and emotionally, and will eventually and unsurprisingly break your heart and drive you into the arms of another asshole?" Girl: "Okay! Hee hee." Guy: "Sweet, dude." I'm sure both parties involved are, deep down, more intelligent than that, but high school kids aren't very open about intelligence. It's something they'd rather hide and be ashamed of. Maybe if I start throwing the word "ho" around and call girls "my bitches" I'll be able to get a girlfriend and have a superficial relationship. But I won't call it superficial. I'll deceive myself into thinking I'm in love.
