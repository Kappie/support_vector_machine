Errm... hmmm... lol    I've noticed that I have only 1 comment on all my blog site, the one I added!!! Damn you guys!!! lol j/p lol, butadd comments!! lol    I made a new blog site, for my Wyvern game character, Monyameron. Obviously that one'll be more up-beat than this one is, because it's a lively game! :O    Something happened yesterday that really pissed me off. I can't get onto any free website buildersites, or Gaia, so I'm going fora computer rebuild the day before I get broadband (or maybe when I move I dunno, I'm moving btw ^.^)    Yeah I can't think of anything else really, surprised my entry got so far if I'm honest... lol       Well, peace      Paul :)      P.S. MSN description for today is: I was on the road to suicide, but I found a lane that lead to happiness, thank you to my two friends that helped me.
