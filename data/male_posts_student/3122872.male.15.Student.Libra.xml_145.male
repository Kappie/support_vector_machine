I might be dictionarily challenged... but I don't tell girls they're weird on a first date :P or talk about the weather *muffled laughter*  anyhoo... I've changed the descrip about the blog... to something more appropriate... considering what it started as, (me ranting...and rambling) to what it is now, (the three of us having a go at each other), so why not...  Sit back folks, and enjoy the show...   By the way, I was never the happiest man in the world, ask anyone I know...  the normal reply is that I'm constantly in a depressed mood... which isn't all that far off...  Everything going okay in the land of nod... or more commonly known as Canada... althoguh I did learn something about them today...  Today was Canada day...think... 4th of July for (obviously) Canada... and we went to a park where they were celebrating... it was all quite normal until the speeches came... they had this Health Minister Guy... Here was the general gist of the speech:   Canada is a great country... blahblahblah... I'm honoured to be with you all to celebrate the 137th birthday of our country...blahblahblah...Canada is greatest country in the world...What is the greatest country in the world? yes... Canada... etc etc    Canada is the greatest country in the world???  Gimme a break... and I thought Americans were self centred... :/  That's it from me for now...   Miss Emma... :(  Bleh...
