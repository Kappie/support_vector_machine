And not for just that reason. It's not healthy mentally and physically. Plus if i only smoke and/or drink on the weekend i won't have as much of a tolerance, so i'm really looking forward to getting fukked up this weekend and every weekend!   What's this!? an official SMUT gathering without the leadership of Bob.. guys make it happen!!!   Have a SMUTTY day!  - R w L super SMUT
