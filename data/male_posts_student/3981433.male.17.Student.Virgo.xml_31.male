Very sweet film - definatly worth seeing.  Meeting Ezme tomorrow - nice lass - hope shes the same in real life. probably gonna go to the cinema, watch some gay film, might go for lunch depending on the weather, possibly the park - so little to do in southend.  didnt do much else tonight apart from watch lads army. really funny. all these "hard-ass" criminals getting kicked is just so....reassuring.  whats with all these bloody gnat bites on my legs and feet? hey look nasty - if i wanna go swimming in Disneyland they better heal up pretty quick - time to get the zinc pills out.  Mums gone to hastings for a few days today - seeing her brother. so i'll hava nice relaxing weekend and stuff - however i might have to skip kung-fu on saturday - i've gotta pick up money from charli and gem for disneyland...which could work into a bit of a muddle.  well off to bed now - got a long day of entertaining ahead....OMG some photos rosy sent me today are just....*dribble* you get the idea...and she says shes ugly...wtf is with that?
