My sister called and asked if we wanted to go to dinner with her, my mother and Deb.  Cindy saw some cows and wanted one for a pet.  So we drove for an hour and stopped at Taco Bell to see my Aunt Mary Joan and my grandmother.  We chatted for awhile and then headed to Connie's diner for dinner.  We ate for awhile, I had a turkey club and Cindy had a tuna melt.  We told a lot of jokes and laughed a lot.  Cindy and I headed back to Rochester in a lightning storm.  I dropped her off and headed back to Brockport.  Now I'm just sitting in the living room with Jake, Kristen, Rachael and their friend.  I said hi to Jake and he of course told me to shut up.  Ahh.. this is the life.  Quotes:  (Describing the aliens in the tv show) "Well, they were tall... played by women and very white." - Luke "Oh god, those scary caucasian aliens!" - Cindy  "Well, you have a small tank." - Aunt Deb "Excuse me??" - Luke "We didn't want to bring it up Luke, but it had to happen." - Deb
