Two-month old Mickey's, backwashed as any final six ounces of a 40 must be, discarded carelessly in a damp, dank cabinet used to show those who visited my apartment the glory beheld in cheap tall boy cans and cheaper glass bottles.    Rule #1 - No amount of Febreeze can get rid of the stench of old, tepid malt liquor.  The mix of the two resembles the smell when you're on a barstool next to the stage at a strip club as dollar cooch is paraded in front of your face whilst a girl who doesn't even look good under dim lighting smiles that "You know you want it, big boy" smile...all the while you're wondering why this seemed like a good idea for so-and-so's bachelor party, considering it wasn't a good idea for the three bachelor parties before (thanks to Dan Wearsch for noting  urlLink how hot they are at Missouri Hots ).  I won a $20 Amazon gift certificate today by hitting the Apartment God with a small stuffed soccer ball.  The god and the certificate were Brian's; the place was packed and moved, save a lone mattress delivered by Brother Mike from Stillwater, where our amphibian deity was perched, keeping watch over our games of grabass.  The games he presided over were countless, always employing some sort of object to be thrown or kicked or hit or missed or pelted or grazed or knocked off or knocked on.  So it was fitting that our final game in the apartment that, until today's Mickey's episode, smelled like the Holiday Inn was to take Soccer Ball (a small plush soccer ball) and hit the god with it.  My spoils look to be in the make of Laurie Anderson, James Baldwin, Johnny Cash, and Charles Bukowski.  In no way am I fucked up.    I cut Bukowski because shipping was a bitch; buying used stuff from people all over the world means each has to put down $4 for shipping, and I can grab some dirty Charlie B. for pretty cheap in other places.  But even though I asked for my new gift certificate to be used, it looks like Amazon fuckered me and I paid for it all.    Why are help sections on websites so completely helpless?  I clicked the box that said APPLY GIFT CERTIFICATE, and to email someone to ask if it actually happened (because it says it didn't), I have to go throguh some sort of demo reel where I am told how easy it is to pay with a credit card.  No shit, I just did it; give me the fucking address so I can email someone.  I used to design websites for Centenary; Help sections were the most fun for us to work on, because all a help page does is redistribute the links on the other pages; the Help section never takes you anywhere new; it's an index for jackasses.  Yet I still go there, looking for that  mailto:  hyperlink so I can create discourse with a benevolent woman from Kentucky who is pleased that I shopped Amazon.com, and wants to make sure that my shopping experience was stellar!    (The glory of writing...I've spent the past 30 minutes working through this shit, yet you are blissfully unaware that my face is red, my teeth grinding, and I am shouting obscenity at replicae of Star Wars heroes...by the way, before I settled on the etaoin shrdlu monicker and solidified my position as the gayest straight man ever, I considered the apt phrase from the days of Nero... bellum plus quam civilia ...special thanks to Steve Clark for introducing me to that, Argus the dog, and information about the decapitation and parusal of Cicero's head for a general public...all my heroes were shamelessly killed)  As I was handing my keys and parking tag to the woman in the apartment office (the general manager is new, and the assistant is still the same woman, and the first thing I thought was that this was a perfect example racial discrimination and/or the hegemonic institution of Marquis Relators was practicing nepotism or Southern/American pride...I think this makes me a grad student more than my want to sleep with undergrads), I asked if there was anything we needed to sign, any paperwork that needed to be completed, or any hugs for the staff, because they always affectionately called us "The boys from E341." (just that brought me close to tears).  She said no, we were good to go.  "So I can just throw up the deuce?" I asked, grinning as my index and middle fingers readied for upward thrust.  "I'd rather you not throw up in here," she said.  I learned this afternoon that a hero of mine vomited after a night of heavy tequila drinking.  I am waiting for them to parade his head on a stick through via Consulare.
