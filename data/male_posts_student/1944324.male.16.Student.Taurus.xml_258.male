Anyway, I think people aren't posting because they don't know what to say.  So, I'm taking it upon myself to reaffirm what the blog is for.  -- Posting interesting developements in your life that are not gossipy or girl/boy crazy. -- Posting Philosophical quandaries about random or interesting topics, like time or love. -- Relating interesting facts about stuff like cod or England -- Posting amusing anecdotes (funny is good) -- Convorsations!!! -- Suggestions for improving the blog, or for other bloggers, like this one.  You all have atleast one of these in your head now, so post.  Or face the consequences.   It's okay! I had Subway!
