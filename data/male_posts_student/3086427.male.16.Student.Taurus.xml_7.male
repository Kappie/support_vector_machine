THE CASE FOR IIT    PRO'S  1.One of the best engineering institutions in the world.Mind you,one of the  best,not the best. 2.Low cost education.(compared to foreign universities) 3.Indianness-will feel more at home than abroad.  CON'S  1.Exam is terribly tough and unpredictable.No guaranteee I will make it. 2.Many IIT's-Kharagpur,Guwahati,Kanpur,situated in midst of nowhere,with almost no interaction with other colleges except for the odd festival. 3.Rigid,inflexible courses.Once you are assigned,say metallurgical engineering,you cant change over to Computer engineering(the better paying one).      The Case for Foreign Universities    PRO'S  1.Flexibility of courses. 2.Much easier to get admission into,what with my superlative academic and extra-curricular record. 3.International exposure,resulting in fuller development. 4.More prestigious and famous.I am talking about the best-MIT,Stanford,Ivy League. 5.Much better infrastructure and living conditions.  CON'S  1.Having just turned 16,I am too young for going abroad. 2.Financial aid uncertain.I can only go if I get a scholarship of 75% or more. 3.Culture shock.   So what do you think I have chosen?? Or should choose??
