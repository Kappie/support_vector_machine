I have to work on my EASH constitution project tonite, which is not putting me in the best of moods I guess, but anyway, I think I've found a site that'll host this blog with a shorter address, AS-Hosting.  They have some fun stuff for me to play with too it looks like.  I watched alias today, since I missed it last night by going to youthgroup with Logan.  But I sorta missed Adam so I went for that too.  Ohhh but it was a good one.  Except it all seemed kinda like it had already happened.  I mean, someone always says something and then, 2 seconds later when everyone is confused and wants him/her to explain someone comes up and fills 'im with lead.  I think I figured out what Vaughn is gonna tell Syd next week though, since Lauren was then one who sniped Sark's dad.  He's gonna say "I only married Lauren because Langley told me to" and then they're gonna kiss and be saved somehow.  Anyway I gotta go eat.
