And what about the crazy guy trying to kiss your hand? Oh, and as far as interesting stories go, I only have a short one. Last week I was in my library one night after we'd closed (having returned to use the phone). It was rather dark but I noticed what appeared to be a huge roach crawling up the wall over the Spanish books. I got the flashlight and indeed, it was a huge roach. I decided the only thing to do was use it for target practice and shoot at it with rubber bands. I had shot off several and was on the verge of giving up, but I decided to go for one more. I got the biggest rubber band out of the box that I could find (and I'm talking an 8" diameter here). Amazingly enough, I hit the thing! Unfortunately, I discovered that the rubber band wouldn't do a significant amount of damage. The roach got away. Perhaps I need larger rubber bands.
