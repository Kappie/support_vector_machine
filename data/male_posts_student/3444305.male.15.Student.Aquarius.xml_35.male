After that though I just came home and did nothing! At all, today I sat at home. Oh wait, my mom took us to Taco Bell, which can't be beat. So I did do something, but we just went through the drive-thru so I don't know if that counts. But after that I sat at home! Like I have been doing alot lately. But I got to watch Summerland tonight. It was amazing, I was dieing from One Tree Hill not being on till the fall, so this temporary replacement works wonders. It's even on at the same time. It diserves a cookie! But, next week Braiden is going to do drugs for this very very hott girl. Her hottness makes him do it, she is just that hott. That lucky bastard him, with that hott girl. But she does drugs, so thats a major turn off. Girls I won't like you like that if you do drugs. So don't do drugs! But that show is awesome. Oh! And a great great movie is on The WB tomorrow night at 7:00 PM. It's "O" with the one and only Julia Styles. It's an amazing story, it's a remake of Shakespeare's Othello for all you deep poetry people out there. And oviously Julia Styles is just hott, so that makes it extra hott. So watch it at 7. And, does anyone wanna buy me a digital camera? Because I asked my parents for one, and they said the good old no. So if anyone wants to buy me a $150 dollar digital camera for an awesome gift for your great friend Brent I would love you. Well thats really about it. I have to go download the Sugarcult CD, because somehow it's mysteriously gone off my computer. Sounds like Nathan needs some explaining to do. Well bye!
