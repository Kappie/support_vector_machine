Her charm and wit affects me by making a sensation of relaxation fill my muscles as I slink back and smile. She tempts me with feelings. That is she makes me feel. She makes me feel sorrow, joy, contentment, good, and bad all at once. I like simply feeling something, anything... but at the same time I desire more. I want her? It's 'cause this desire, like an addiction leads to path that doesn't end... and you walk and walk until you wear yourself out. Walking and walking, or perhaps talking and talking is more like it. Things are said that are more than just words. In them there is meanings that I don't know if are real or not. If they are embedded by her mind or mine? Tonight I shall resist, but will I keep my promise to myself to continue resisting? This girl is the first girl I can say I really liked, without doubt. She's too special and that's why she's the only person I had a serious thing for and stayed friends with. That's why I need to resist.  *
