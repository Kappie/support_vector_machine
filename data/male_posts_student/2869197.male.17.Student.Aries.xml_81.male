Easily, in my top three movie favs (The Matrix and Lord of the Rings [both the first in the trilogies]being the others). I really enjoy fight-the-system mentality. It's one of the reasons I'm becoming a missionary. Marx viewed the religious leaders negatively because they provided nothing to the great economic machine (I think, I've yet to read his Manifesto. I hear it's a good one). The value I provide will have nothing to do with silver or gold, but with heavenly treasures, much like the freedom found in the fight. Still, I disagree with the destruction of other's property, even on principle. If you cannot defeat them with words, you won't beat them with guns.    Ihad a talkwith my Mom again. As usual, it was like being gored in the man parts. I talk about dreads and you can almost feel the disgust and regret radiating from her. I talked about my camping and she moaned (not aloud but in her stance). She just doesn't understand why I have to stay so long. I do, but if I tell her, it will lose its meaning. I searched the Internet again. I found a good trail, but I don't know if I have to pay to keep my car at the trailhead.    Happy B-day, Aunt C!
