I've gotta refrain from using vulgarities. It's bad for my health... Gotta change... Even though no one cares, I still gotta change.     No one cares... I'm always lonely... Isn't lonliness a good thing? People around me pretend to care. I don't know why they pretend to care. But, it's so fake. Why don't everyone stop caring? It's hurting me from the inside... All those lies that cloud my mind. I can't differentiate the truth from lies... There are just too many lies inside of me... Don't you all hate me? Then, why still act as though you care? Don't you get sick and tired from acting? You all are just a bunch of liars... I don't wanna hate you, but... I have no choice if you want to carry on your act... Why don't you all just say that you hate me? Isn't it much easier? Isn't it much better? Stop your act...
