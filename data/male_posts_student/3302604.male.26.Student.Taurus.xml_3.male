Feel free to comment or email anyhting you feel relevant and maybe I'll even get back to you. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Jack, I am 26 and single, living in Edinburgh. I am in the second of a four year Maths with Education course at  urlLink Heriot- Watt University  (although the education parts actually are run by  urlLink Stirling - don't ask but it'll become clear what we all think about  that ).  I live in a third floor tenement flat with two other students, one on my course and the other on another. When I'm not at uni, I work in a discount book store two days a week, so I've got a little beer money. I am an ice hockey fanatic, supporting both my local team (the  urlLink Edinburgh Capitals ) and an American team (the  urlLink >Colorado Avalanche ). Anything else that I haven't thought of that is relevant, I'll explain as we go along.  By the way, it is not my intention to offend anybody, adn if I do so I'm sorry. My opinions may not be accurate adn the evidence I use can be anything from years of detailed study to something I read at a bus stop once. Feel free to correct me as neceaary.  Thanks  Jack
