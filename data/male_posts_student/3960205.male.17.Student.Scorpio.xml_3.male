Stress has become so inherent in our lives that if it's not there then it seems as if something's amiss. Oh, no its not another droning stress diagnostic.    I had been going through a few blogs, surfing through the random expressions. So many thoughts, so many emotions. Musing over why people need to put down their thoughts on a web page. Has it become the easiest medium to do so? Maybe. Or is it that it's a place to escape from the monotonous jostle of daily life.     A buzzing world where one can take a plunge in the depths of fantasy. The enigmatic charisma of this boisterous space cannot be undermined. This place seems like heaven. Sharing thoughts and emotions is good. But does it matter? Being content is what matters more. As time wafts maturity dawns, it's no longer a necessity that others read you and be impressed or opinionate your musings. I still ask myself, why write it down? To look back at it after moving ahead in time? Does it really matter if someone reads my thoughts? There must be someone who can understand without me having to say a single word. And that someone is what matters most.    However this doesn't subdue the importance of writing and expressing oneself. Everyone needs a space, a personal space, where he or she can escape to, to unwind. A solitary space that is so hard to find in this vivacious world. Besides, cramming the words on a web page is better than cramming the numerous thoughts inside those microscopic brain cells. If those miniature elements wish to be free and blown up on a larger canvas, then they should be.  Why tie yourself up? Speaking out one's mind often disperses the heaviness and glum hanging about the heart. It's integral to all beings. The very soul is restless, twitching under obligations and itching for freedom. Freedom cannot be defined precisely, though. Here, it maybe this trance that engulfs us but terminates as soon as we're out of it.    Even though, in this medium, one can't be sure of being read or being understood and pointed out in the crowd, it's a fab place to be in. These musings express individuality and somewhere or the other reflects the essence of each and every one of us. Veracity and spontaneity are the two bare bones that captured my attention. These impeccable thoughts, they do edifice the mind. No it's not about pure entertainment, it's more about contemplation. A felicitous spot for all those who are not punctilious about writing instead they do it coz it comes straight from the heart.    In all, it's a consummate affair.
