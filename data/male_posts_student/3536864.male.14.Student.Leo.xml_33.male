Most of the chords had either a flat or sharp on the 3 and 5 fingers, and a natural on the 1. Kinda cool.  I eventually harnessed it and put it in C and ended both hands on a C Major.  It was cool because i played it and it sound kind of cool, but it was also a bit mushed together and from a technical standpoint it wasn't very good.  Someone who is better than me would probably have smiled and said, "Yeah, that's good." and pat me on the shoulder all the while having this condescending 'I know something you don't know' smile and think the same thing.  Ah well, it will come with technic and practice.  Until next entry                                                   Shonan
