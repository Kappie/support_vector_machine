That night I had a weeird and scary and bad dream about Gary yelling at me and saying I was a horrible worker, and Ashley kept calling me at work and I kept having to put her off because Gary was there.  I woke up with an immense feeling of dread.  Today was a good day, though!  We voted for student council representatives for next year.  And I've been playing ut for a while since I've been home.  I've been playing some guitar, and I could play the opening riff to Almost Honest by Megadeth, if my guitar was in tune.  Blargh.  Now..... to play some more UT or maybe some Painkiller...... or..... *gasp* kotor?  I've been neglecting that beautiful game.  Oh well.
