Our old one wouldn't pick up any dirt at all =- Anyway, the vacuum was the  urlLink Eureka Boss SmartVac Model# 4870. . I would like to say it is the best vacuum out there, but our old one was so sucky (or not sucky =-P) That I wouldn't know. If I remember correctly it was rated #1 by  urlLink Consumer Reports , but I am not sure. Anyway, I also cut my knee, but that was after I vacuumed. Everything is ok now, even though it still hurts. =-) Talk to ya later.
