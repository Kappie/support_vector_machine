Just a different person doing a different something always seems to make me happy.   And that is also why I sometimes loathe myself. I never change. I'm constantly an anti-social dick, and I really dislike that about myself, but I try. I try to push myself to the verge of talking to people I usually don't, but I've found that I am either socially intimdated or I just  can't  talk to certain people.  As I once told someone, sometimes I want to blow off my head, and sometimes  I don't.  Hmph.
