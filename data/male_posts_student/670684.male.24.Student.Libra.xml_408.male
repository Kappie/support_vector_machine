It hadn't been the best week, and the realization of what honest writing entails, and its significant lack of purpose other than menial catharsis and worry from others left me as a writing graduate who didn't want to write.    And then I got an email from Dana Bamburak.    Last year, after my TIP experience, I drafted a short bit about my adolescent career, and what could be considered a turning point if you wanted to specify a turning point...and it related to an unknowing Dana Bamburak who took an interest in me and changed me from a despondent visiter to Arkansas to someone who graduated from Rogers High with pride in 1997.  Lots happened before and after, but stories are great, and in a world where we design life on pivotal moments, what better than a first relationship story?    So Dana found the blog, like some before her, and emailed me a short bit about it, basically a check up, because really, we haven't talked since November 1993.  Eleven years.    I don't think it makes me old.  I think it means that I've been alive longer.  Age is inidiscriminate, and an unfair litmus of activity.  If we consider my birth into a greater world around me (which might be the case, though there were great moments before that, mainly my 1991 run as Doody in GREASE!), it could be that Monday moment over a Pomfret sweaty breakfast where Dana and I shared an unrecognized bond, forged across a cafeteria table, unable to be shaken by anything execept everything around us.    That year was the best band camp.    ---  It's not about honesty.  Truth is processed so magestically, cranked out by media and politburos, designed to get us living as they show it.  It's about reality, or a push to a reality that once existed.  Again, I'm Baudrillarian here.  But writer's shouldn't use the page as panacea for their maladies; there is a higher purpose to literature and media.  Or there should be.  A story needs the life, but it needs the contents of good storytelling to drive the message home.    I've been disappointed with the blog for a while...too much "This is what I did today.  Woohey!"  There's a desire to make the dwindling reading public happy, to continuously produce mash for critical siphoning.  Fuck that.
