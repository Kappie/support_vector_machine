So that's what happened today. You see: I have a problem with my computer wherein OGM files always worked perfectly, untill one day they stopped working completely. I'm pretty good with computers but to this day I have never found a solution, or even a reason, for this problem. In the meantime I've formatted my computer several times and transfered from Win2K to XP Professional.  So today I went looking for Escaflowne Episode 1 (any format other than OGM) which isn't easy to find seeing as Escaflowne is old (extremely ancient by internet standards) and usually only available in a single format (all 26eps OGM Bit Torrent). And so I went looking for the episodes individually starting with ep1... I spent the whole day looking for it: downloaded an additional 4 file-sharing programs to my arsenal, spent several hours in a row in front of my comp, surfed the internet, etc. etc. It's a beutifull day and I've spent it all indoors in my basement. I haven't been able to download the file yet. The sad thing is I intend to spend all of tommorow looking for it as well. Why? FOR I AM A FILE-SHARING GURU AND I WILL NEVER GVE UP!!!!  On the brighter side of things I found the manga "Blood: The Last Vampire" that I've been looking for, for a while now. It's all in individual images on different pages. There goes my beuty-sleep.  -Guru Nesck
