"An equation means nothing to me unless it expresses a thought of God," he said, and he meant it.  In response to G.H. Hardy's comment that "1729 was a dull number," Ramanujan replied:  "No, it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as a sum of two cubes in two different ways."  In other words, 9^3 + 10^3 = 1729 and 12^3 + 1^3 = 1729.  I don't know if Ramanujan was born with extra circuitry, or if he was just a very good guesser, but based on the output of his work, I would definitely hypothesize the former.  He came up with a bunch of new ways to express various transcendental numbers -- let me show you an example, taken from  urlLink MathWorld 's website:      I don't know how he did that.  Do you?
