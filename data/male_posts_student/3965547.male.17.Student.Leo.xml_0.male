The film producers have got all of America's top current rock bands to work on it, and with some excellent tracks, it cannot be missed. All of the tracks have been penned especially for the film, with the highlight of the album probably being track 2 - "Ordinary" by Train.    Track Listings:    01: Dashboard Confessional - Vindicated  02: Train - Ordinary  03: Hoobastank - Did You  04: Jet - Hold On  05: Yellowcard - Gifts and Curses  06: Maroon 5 - Woman  07: Taking Back Sunday - This Photograph Is Proof  08: Midtown - Give It Up  09: Lostprophets - Lucky You  10: Smile Empty Soul - Who I Am  11: The Ataris - The Night That The Lights Went Out  12: Ana - We Are  13: Jimmy Gnecco ft. Brian May - Someone To Die For  14: Danny Elfman - Spidey Suite  15: Danny Elfman - Doc Ok Suite    Truly Amazing Soundtrack and a recommended listen from me. I cant stop listening to it myself :)
