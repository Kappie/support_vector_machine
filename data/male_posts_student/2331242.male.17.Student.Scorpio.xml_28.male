And he gives a booming scream:    "I'm going to make tacos with your corpse!!"         Find out!  Enter username:   Are you  a girl, or  a guy ?         created by  urlLink  beatings    :  powered by  urlLink  monkeys         So that's my battle cry. I have a headache and a fever. Mellow mushroom is tasty. Prince of Persia is difficult.  Martha called tonight. She was happy but tired. We miss eachother. My underpants are in bad repair.  Tomorrow the Panthers play. They will be victorious. There will be much rejoicing. And streaking.  Moo moo moo... moo... moo. I want my money back from all the videogames I gave up on. Such as Diablo 2.  I owe Martha a lot of money. I don't like it when I owe people money.  The semester is over. I decided not to redo an overnight write like I was supposed to. I shall suffer for it. Whatever.  Mr. Anderson can be a nazi sometimes. He surprised us with 30 notecards due on Wednesday. That's like.... soon. Holy shit I'm shaking in my boots.  Bedtime.
