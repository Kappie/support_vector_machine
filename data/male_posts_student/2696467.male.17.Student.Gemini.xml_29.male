It's pretty okay considering I haven't wrote anything in a long time... check it out:  Drugs enter my mind, and make me think I'm some other kind, so away from it all, nothing but glass to break my fall, though I stagger I stand up, scream out loud I don't give a fuck, untill my lungs bleed from the weed, then I pass out on the floor, but I'm always ready for more, If you cant see then you must be blind cuz I see some crazy shit all the time, Illness is all around and it seems to kill us, every last hope shattered, all the remains are scattered, Every question that has an answer brings us to nowhere faster.  Time works as death lurks aroound every corner, another mourner, all seems to pass as first becomes last, a clock ticks while a mind plays tricks, true love is nowhere, while hate prevails, another ship sinks and another sails, a neverending game has me singing songs in the rain, as a substance enters my brain. When will it all end, when can I stop playing pretend when will we all see that there isn't really much to see.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  There you go.... anyway, today I went to a local baseball game.. my two cousin's play on a team and I've been watching them play for a long time... its like a all age league so it gets some good action.... mostly age 17+ play.... Today they just won 9-2 to tie the series 1-1.... its the first series of the playoffs... whoever wins tomorrow goes on so it should be exciting... last year they made it to the championship series and lost..  anyway I also downloaded a few Pink Floyd songs, and a DJ Tiesto song... some pretty good music....  Well its almost 2 AM again so I guess I might go listen to music and go to bed..  Later, -Haze-
