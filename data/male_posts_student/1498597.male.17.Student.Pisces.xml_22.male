It is very early, and if you happened to read the  Punk Rock Editorial  before you read this blog, then you know why I am up so early...Anyway, to business.  It seems that today may be sunny with light clouds, but you can never really tell what the weather will be like in good ol'  Riverside !  Well, i don't think I can make anymore weather forecasts for today because I'm pretty tired out and because I'm not your local meterologist!  Well, I hope  Nick  comes on to take over since it is now the  morning shift , which is not the shift that I work (I only do morning shifts on weekends), and types a follow-up blog to this one.  Sorry for not givin' you a cheery mornin' prediction, but I'm one of those people who really doesn't do mornings very well.  Anyway, I should clock out and start gettin' ready for school.  Signin' out of the  graveyard shift , its  JR. !!!   Nikolas Brown  will be takin' over shortly...stay tuned!
