I was buying myself a suit and in the changing room stepped on my pants.  With the pda in them.  CRA-CRACK.  Damn.  It still works perfect, sounds perfect (listening to some megadeth on it now, with my 'borrowed' Koss headphones) but I hate those two purple lines.  That is, hated.  Because over night and repeated playing of old NES roms, I think the lcd display may have filled up or reformed or whatever. One of the purple lines is gone, leaving a little thin crack (hardly visible) and the BIG purple tinge is fading, and will leave another crack.  Hmmmm.... I hope it will leave, that is.  Damn, though.  The stylus recognition is still as good as it ever was, though.  I think replacing the screen though, will cost too much, so I'm just gonna give you the pda, Franz, for 20 bucks.  Maybe just as your belated xmas gift.  Since its both inherantly cool and shitty.  Yes, no?  Back to the suit I bought, oh man is it nice.  Its black and some sort of thin and non-itching wool.  I think I just my wear the jacket religiously and jeans and a tshirt from now on because I look so freakin' good in it.  Oh, and I got heavy comments from my sisters and their boyfriends after that 2 hour call.  Yeah... Ryan is now calling me Wesley-San now.  I'm sorry I couldn't talk any longer last night, but they were being loud since they knew it was you.  That night I saw 2001:a space odyssey.  And let me tell you something. I DO NOT GET THE ENDING.  And HAL is EVIL.  And one letter behind IBM. Get it?  I was like... OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH when I realized that.  So I did bio/zoo today. Hmmm. gregor mendell is the coolest.  My family had an interesting conversation about our history of manic depression.  It made Sonja have psychotic episodes and threaten people and come up with weird big brother theories and got landed in the looney bin for a bit.  Same for my mother multiple times.  Ok, so what if this happened to Derek?  Honestly, think about it.  A guy who could take a beating from 5 other guys, with 2 years of kung fu, 5 of ninjitsu, knives upon knives in his room, some guns, and he goes manic.  He could be a certifiable public menace... he would *kill someone*.  I guess weed stops him from going whacked out, right?  I hope.  I could just imagine 9 orderlies surrounding him and a nurse with a huge syringe trying to overpower him.  He's in the center frothing at the mouth (as he tends to do when he's exasperated) and he's punching these people out, in fits of manic rage.  Its a scary thing... it may happen to me, too.  Sometimes our anger gets a hold of us.... scary.   Its a common occurance for my sisters to split under pressure, Sonja split in high school and when writing her Master's thesis.  Some crazy stuff happened in high school.......  The reason I try to keep a load of work is because of this history of snapping.  I can sometmes feel it may happen.  Thats why I don't get involved in 4 or so activities and all the other crap because I fear for my own safety and stability.  I'm fairly certain I can get by with my goals without overachieving like some people.    But I know I shouldn't let myself go into a spiral of laziness like Derek.  Sure he's in college, but the man takes few classes and such.  He doesn't realize thathe should've extended himself and his education to get a paying job to support himself.  Theres a reason for school.... he can't rely on my parents forever, he seems to think he can.  SO..... what else.   Haha, if tallness is a dominant trait... hmmmmm... ;)  I miss you, Kim.  I'm gonna go on a long lonesome walk now.
