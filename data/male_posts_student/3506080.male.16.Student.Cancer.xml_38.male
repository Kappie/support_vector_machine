I know most people found mining boring, but I didn't. Now that Aaron is gone, we might have to   work a bit harder. He has surpassed my total skill level. His stats can be found at the bottom of this post. I would like all of us to have at least one skill above one of his. I do have my skill done. My mining is still higher than his (unless he got a few hundred thousand xp in the past day.) Anyway, here are his skills.        Total Skill: 952    Attack: 67    Defence: 66    Strength: 67    HP: 67    Ranged: 52    Prayer: 49    Magic: 45    Cooking: 57    Woodcutting: 53    Fletching: 33    Fishing: 55    Firemaking: 54    Crafting: 50    Smithing: 49    Mining: 71    Agility: 36    Thieving: 34    *Any skills not shown are not above level 30.    If you have surpassed any of these,  please  put a comment on here. Thank you!
