It's long distance to phone in to use it though, so I expect I won't be using it much unless I go on trips where I can't reach a computer.  Drinking some Coke C2 right now. My mom, uncharacteristically, bought an 8-pack of cans of Coke C2. That's not normal. She never lets pop into the house usually. I am weirded out.  Not complaining, though.  My friend Dana put up a blog too: http://babysitter79.blogspot.com/2004/08/weirdest-babysitting-ever.html  Too much pink and not enough personal info, but cool anyway IMO.   I should really get to bed, it being 1:01.  iPod minis are so damn cool. I love mine. It's silver, and I got a green rubber case to go over it, with a lanyard thing so I can attach it to my belt loop. :D Life is good.  My cell phone has blue flames on it.  I've updated my profile, so you can read the nauseating lameness that was in the first post, and also see a picture of me. See that nerf gun? That's what happens to you if you piss me off. 20 suction cups to the face.  I'm posting way too much already.  Keep the comments coming, and vote for Kerry, not Bush or Nader! (Even though I'm not from the US. Still, if YOU are, vote Kerry. And go see Fahrenheit 9/11.)  Sol Kauffman, clicking out.
