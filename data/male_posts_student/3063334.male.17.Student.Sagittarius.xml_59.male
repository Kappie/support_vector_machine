That being said, you really don't have to 'clarify yourself in a dignified manner'  I felt your original post, even if meant for Thomas' rather less tame personal blog, was fine and no personal slight at my personal politics at all.  I guess I was just on a defensive republican bent that night, probably worrying about Kerry's successful poll numbers:-)  So I guess I'm apologizing for sounding like a bitchy little republican, you really have no reason to apologize, clarification is often a must in debate but I really don't think you said anything out of line or offensive to me.  So to steer the conversation anyway in a different direction....  Who's read the Da Vinci code here?  I started reading it yesterday and really can't put it down.  There's nothing particularly wonderful or interesting in the prose, but I find the storytelling and suspense to be excellent, as well as the subject matter.
