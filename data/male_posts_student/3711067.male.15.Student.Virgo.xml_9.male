Where We Can Hide You; And No One Will Hear You Scream, Where War Is Like Water, -A Constant Stream- Purple Mountain majesty, Amber Waves Of Grain, Billions Of Defenseless Minorities, And Generations Of Pain, Rights Won By The Rich, Home To Waste, And Gashes We Refuse To Stitch, Welcome To America. Nice To Have You, Bitch.
