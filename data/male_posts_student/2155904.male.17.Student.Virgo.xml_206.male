Today started out pretty early for Tyke as he got up at 6 to get dressed, put his suit on, and get ready for school.  It was nice to get all dressed up and when Tyke presented his speech before leaving he did it well so he was prepared to do well in class as well.  In 1st period he came back to a nice little Calc quiz, that was just some great fun.  Too bad Tyke hasn't learned shit about integrals even though his class is supposedly about Calculus but really there isn't any learning of anything other than how to draw dicks on stuff and try to hide them from the teacher (Tyke doesn't draw, he just laughs).  But after that he went to weight training where he had to change out of his suit which wasn't too bad but then he thought he was going to have to do maxes for the different lifts today but he was misinformed.  So he just talked with that junior girl for some of the period and did a little workout.  They got out of class early so Tyke was able to change back into his suit with no troubles.  Then he went to Gov for his speech.  He got many a comment through the day about how people liked his suit, his tie, or just the spiffy dressing he had done.  He was hoping for that :).  But it was fun to be in a suit all day.  And his speech went well.  He sorta didn't go PC in his speech and said "blacks" a lot and upon second realization he sorta thought he could have come off a little racist, or at least retarded, but hey, that's Tyke.  The rest of the day was pretty fun.  Walking around in the sun, talking with friends, eating pizza, just loving the moment.  In 5th period Tyke had to almost work the whole period.  But he got out for a while and ended up getting spotted by that junior girl again so they talked for a few minutes and Tyke has come to the realization that is really really nice.  She's a cool girl to hang out with and she makes the conversations fun so that's all that matters.  Unfortunately for Tyke, he didn't have his phone with him that period so he didn't get Purdy's texxxt (accidentally typed texxt first time so Tyke decided to just add one more x for fun) message about how they could hang out for a little.  But then they went to 6th period and listened to music as part of the classwork and then the day was over.  Tyke and Purdy went out to Tyke's car where MormoMan, Macaroon, Piggy J, etc had all congregated for a little talking apparently.  And all the while Tyke was half naked in the back of his car trying to get clothed.  Hmmm...is that gay?  Finally Tyke got dressed and quickly decided he was leaving so Purdy got in and they left the boys there.  Haha, good times.  Tyke got his tux today.  It's sick.  If you haven't seen the card that Tyke has, the one that gets him a discount on his tux cuz he's a rep, then Tyke will describe it for you.  But if you have seen the picture then it is just like that (and the guy in the tux looks soooooo much like Tyke).  Ok, here's how it looks.  It is a zoot suit tux and is pretty gangsta.  All white except for black vest and tie.  Black shoes with white tongues.  4 or 5 button coat that extends down to Tyke's thighs and has a chain in the pants.  Tyke still needs to get the fedora (hat) to go with it he thinks but that shouldn't be too hard.  This tux is gonna be tight.  Man, can't wait.  Just over a week away.  Sooooo excited.  Oh man, June is this next week.  Incredible.  Incredible.  Incredible.  Hardly anything left to do now.  After getting his tux, Tyke and Purdy went to Orange Julius, got really good smoothies and then went to Old Navy.  Of course they went to get flip-flops, cuz you can never have too many flip-flops as Tyke learned.  Right after Old Navy the two drove back to Purdy's to drop her off.  It wasn't that long of a trip but Tyke was stoked about getting his tux so it was very successful.  And then Tyke came home and got working.  He took about a 15 minute nap (accidental of course) and then started working on his grad portfolio cuz he failed it and all the first time.  That took a long time to do because he had to make it actually professional this time as well as the fact that he was downloading music the entire time and making a new cd.  He downloaded a lot of songs but many of the songs are for the prom cd which he hasn't burned yet.  That cd will have much slower, nighttime songs but they will still be classics.  This cd has a lot of classic rock on it.  Almost exclusively actually.  And he is listening to it now in fact.  A little Don't Fear the Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult at the moment.  I NEED MORE COWBELL!!!!  Well now Tyke is done with all of that and he saw the end of the Pistons game which was tight cuz Tayshaun Prince is tight and so is Tyke.  Really tight.  Now Tyke must bid adieu.  Adieu.
