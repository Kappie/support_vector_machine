Well it would be except the neighbor also gave permission to her mother to have a widow support church group thing. They were supposed to be gone by 7. They also brought a niece (I neded to mention that sometime)  They just WON'T LEAVE!  They're "waiting for the niece's mom to come." And she's late and she's really pissing me off. I wanted a nice swim today. Instead I got a bunch of old people swimming in the pool that is rightfully ours, since they had it until 7 and it is presently 8:18.  I hate old people. Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!
