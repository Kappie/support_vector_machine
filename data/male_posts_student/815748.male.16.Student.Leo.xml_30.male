And yet, at Model UN, she sarcastically agrees with everything the US says, in mockamatation of Tony Blair. This happened at a recent meeting, and Loren and I had the following conversation and conceputalization (without specific citations:  "Wait, doesn't Maria, like, idolize England?"  "Maybe she idolizes every part of England EXCEPT Tony Blair.... and yet models herself after him."  "Maybe Tony Blair is watching from his secret camera, and he's like, 'Is that really how people think of me?'"  "'I resign.'"   -also-  In Model UN, I made a hilarious speech, saying "We Swiss are a scholarly people."  Afterward I yielded to Ben Ostrogoth, Nepal, who wasn't prepared.
