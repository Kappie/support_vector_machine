It seemed so magical to watch those nasty naps disappear to be replaced by beautiful, long, straight, black hair. My favorite past time as I grew up was going with my mama to the beauty shop to watch all those women sit all day to have their “kitchens” fixed with a hot combed or some hot stuff that made them scream after a while. I laughed until my sides ached when hey would yell, “Take it off!“ Take it off!“ “You better get this shit off my head before my hair fall out!”  I loved those days so much that I used to dream of the day that I would someday stand in the kitchen asking somebody to hold my ear or sit for hours at the hair shop to get my hair fixed. I even dreamed of being a hairdresser. My day finally arrived when the choir director at my church said that nobody could wear cornrows for the concert. My dad had never let me get my hair permed or straightened, but on this day we went straight to the shop to get me a Jerry Curl! I was so cool! My hair was longer than I had ever seen it, and those naps that made me cry, when my sister braided my hair each Friday night, were gone. I had long, shiny curls. It was the happiest day in my life, I thought.  As life goes for the average black woman living in the U.S., I went from Jerry Curl to Soft and Beautiful, Bone Straight, Luster Silk, Hawaiian Silky, Dudley’s, Creme of Nature, Sheenique, Motions...you know the line up! I even followed my dreams through and became a hairdresser. I followed the part to a “T”! I told black women how nappy their hair was when I saw them, convinced them that I could get rid of that problem by “fixing” their hair with a hot comb or a perm. Yeh, I fixed them, I fixed them alright........  Though I didn’t know why at the time, I left the hair straightening industry after three short years.  So about five years ago, I decided I was tired of burning my scalp and my ears, so I started braiding my hair. I hated how nappy it got in just a few days, however. I would “texturize” some of it just to make it manageable sometimes. About 3 years ago, I got heavily into hip-hop and my own Afrikan history. I began to discover the essence of being true to oneself, you know... “Keeping it Real!” While keeping it real meant different things to different people, what it meant to me was that I could do whatever I wanted with myself, so I did. I stopped changing the texture of my hair!  bell hooks visited my area about a year ago and we had a chance to discuss one of her new books, Sisters of the Yam: Black Women and Self-Recovery. This book changed my life in a couple of ways. While hooks always indicts the white, supremacist, capitalist patriarchy so eloquently, she most touched me with her ideas about black nihilism. I have looked closely at how historical inequality and oppression manifests itself among our community. One of the key tactics of this covert warfare being waged against Afrikans living in the U.S. is nihilism, which leads our people to adopt mainstream values and traditions that are senseless and useless to our communities. In essence, we are killing ourselves through self-hate and community mutilation. While this is obvious in scenarios of extreme crack infestations, black-on-black crime, objectification and rejection of black women and so on, it is also dangerous, as it is pervasive in the very foundations of who were are--OUR HAIR!  When I first started wearing my hair natural, my people were outraged and offended. Of course, there was an occasional brotha or sista with locks that felt me, but in general, I encountered harsh reactions.   Please process this slowly....We were born with locks and have been trained to hate them, therefore hate ourselves and others who keep them! When I went to church with my hair natural, the children ran up to me and said, “You need a perm!” An eight-year-old girl had already been indoctrinated to hate herself to the point that she was advising me on how to make in this world. I cried for her that night.  Our recovery has to begin with who we are and if you are a black woman or know any black women, then you know that our hair is a big part of who were are. I now know that I stopped doing hair and stopped straightening my own because of the war going on inside of me.   We have been trained to hate ourselves, but it’s not natural. If we surround ourselves in self-loving, conscious-raising environments, before long we can all come to this realization.  ____________________________________________________________________  Seriomente.
