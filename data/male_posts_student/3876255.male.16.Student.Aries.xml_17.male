I mean, why not let everyone know stuff about me?  Anyway, back to the subject of this blog, "Hello."  My name's Matt, and I like breath mints.  So there's my introduction.  About my day today, I woke up late.  I didn't get up until about 1:00, which was when my stepdad called me from town to ask me a question about a computer he wants.  Sometimes it sucks to be the only one in the house who is computer-literate.  I don't care, though, because once he buys a new computer, I will hopefully get his old Compaq.  I'm going to stick it in my closet along with my other broken, messed up, ancient junk.  I save all of my family's old electronics.  But hey, who knows when I may need a, umm, broken voice coil?  After that, I took a bath (mmmm, fresh and clean...) and I was about to go to my local library when my  urlLink friend  called and said he was coming over.  While he was here, a big ol' rainstorm came up and the power flicked off a few times, but I managed to live.  We talked about what we want to be when we grow up.  I have no idea, because every single person in the world is better at everything than I am.  You yourself are probably better at bungie jumping than I am.  Why?  Because I have never been bungie jumping, and I don't plan on doing it anytime soon.  Thanks for the concern.  Conan O'Brien is on right now.  I like watching his show, because it's on television and I like watching television occasionally.  I'm going to mess with the layout of this blog now, I guess.  I need to make it look superly-duperly fantastic, just like  urlLink Lily  says.  Lily is cool.
