On Thanksgiving I visited relatives and stuff...then Friday I went and saw The Missing with my dad (probably the highest part of my weekend).  Then the crazy drama started.  Marty liked the girl I liked, then I thought she liked him as well...I wasn't very happy...I did nothing all saturday, and then Sunday came and I found out she didn't like Marty.  That was cool.  Then me and Marty got talking and we decided we didn't want a girl to get inbetween a good friendship and possibly break up Just For You... again ...so we decided to forget about her...but it turns out she liked this other guy more than me so...it all worked out...except Marty and I are back at square one with no girlfriends...  Oh well, looks like I'll have to go searching again...Oh wait I have more good news.  I got my tickets to the Suicide Machines concert! I can't wait :)...and my mom said I could go if I showed her my math homework from now till the concert (my math grade isn't too hot).  I also can go to my cousin's new band's 1st concert this friday under the same circumstances...that won't be too bad, better than not being able to go at all...yea, I think I can do my math homework for once haha...
