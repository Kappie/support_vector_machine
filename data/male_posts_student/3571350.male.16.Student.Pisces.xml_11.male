What kind of question is that to ask your own child? It sends the message to me wut's wrong you weird person that is listening to this song. I hate when she asks questions that refer to depressing,mad,that's too loud or too sad. She is getting on my nerves people!!! Btw I just took a test How would you murder-  Weapons are not your thing. You would prefer to pummel your opponent to death with your fists and feet. You show a lot of Honor but some power still eludes you. I can give you this power, I can make you stronger, join me.  Become a Vampire!   I love taking quizzes. especially when I'm bored.
