Early this morning, at the brain shattering time of 8:00, I, like many others across the country, whent to the front door in search of the dreaded package. And I'm sure that across the country many found it, and were subsequently thrilled or devestated by what lay witihin. Not me. It wasn't bloody there. To cut a long story short, around 3 hours later I looked out the window to see a bemused looking postie walking up and down the street. He wandered up our lane, promptly took a wrong turn, and whent into our garden. Oh dear. My dad rushed outside and asked him if he had our results.  "Urr, no, don't think so."  Long pause.  "Whaaaatttt!"  Frightened postie.  "Wait, let me just check my satchel."  A couple of seconds of frantic searching.  "Oh wait, here they are."   Yes, here they were, and boy did it feel good. 3 A's and two B's (the A's in Classics, Modern Studies and English, the B's in Computing and Maths.) A big pat on the back for me!   urlLink    Go Davus, Go Davus!  Thanks for reading Stay Beautiful Davus
