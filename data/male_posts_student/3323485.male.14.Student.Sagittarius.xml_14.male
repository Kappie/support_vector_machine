( me, this morning )  Today, I will make my views clear about Britain jouning the EU:  NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!  It will cost us Â£20,000,000 a  YEAR  travelling betweel brusells and Hamberg alone! Then theres all the jobs that will be lost, and most strongly,   the  POSSIBLE  increace in crime . Notice the word possible. I am not condemming anybody, just saying that the possibility is there. With any group of any size, there will always be a few 'bad apples'.  and i bought a keyring yoday for fifty pence
