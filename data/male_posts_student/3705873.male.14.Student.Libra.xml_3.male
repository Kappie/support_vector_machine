I went to Matt's house, and he had enough lager for everybody, which is always good. We tried to get Martin (AKA "pisshead") onto non-alcoholic Becks, but the bastard noticed. Ah well... at least I got invited to his girlfriend's birthday (I think it's her birthday - I really should listen more), which should have pissed him off a bit.  Well, I've been on Prophet's Inc. and Fantasy Essentials - my favourite forums - for the last few hours, chatting to random people. God, I live a sad life.  Oobs.
