A peach of an album. Inspite of a poor quality audio, I have been completely blown away in the first listening. This is a rare occurrence, given the fact that I've been an ARR devotee for the last decade or so. And by devotee I  do  mean, following almost each and every piece he has composed, and not simply his commercially hit music.   ARR's stuff is something which always needs a careful ear; it takes quite a few listenings on a decent set of ear phones, until the music grows on you and until you really begin to appreciate the nuances and subtleties. On numerous occasions I have found myself being absolutely disappointed after the first listening session, only to come back later and find something extra special about it. In fact there are a number of examples of his musical scores, which failed to take off at the box office, only because they weren’t for the masses (even though any genre of music these days is essentially targeted and marketed only for the bucks and the mass appeal). 1947 Earth is a classic example that comes to my mind. Without any hint of doubt, I would rate that as one of his top 10 compositions.  Frankly speaking, I have been drifting away from ARR since the last two or three years, not only in the quest of some good Classic and Bluesy British Rock, but admittedly, Rahman too hasn't produced anything spectacular after  Lagaan . I don't count  Saathiya , because its a parallelized version from his original compositions in Tamil, from Mani Ratnam's  Alai Payuthey , released way before  Saathiya  hit Bollywood. Sure, he did have some great succeess in the Tamil industry, with movies like  Kannathil Muthamittal  and the highly experimental rocker -  Boys . But the journey in Bollywood hasn't exactly been a joy ride.  Tehzeeb , another recent release was forgettable by ARR standards, except for a couple good ghazals.  Lakeer  was also practically a  flop , although again, die hard fans should know that Lakeer's score was taken from his Tamil works; from the film  Rhythm , where Rahman had originally composed five songs depicting each of the five elements -  Water, Wind, Earth (Land), Sky, and Fire . The Tamil score is sensational, and I am at pains to understand why Rahman has to parallelize his score for Bollywood, just about for  any  movie. It just doesn't sound and feel the same in Hindi;  Saathiya  being an exception. In the ARR fans community, talks have been going on, as to how and why ARR has lost his lustre, which though true to a certain extent, isn't anything alarming. Personally, I felt ARR was experimenting too much, to the point where his music did sound monotonous and completely out of sorts (okay, maybe I  should  say crappy!). This is like comparing Sachin Tendulkar's batting. Not so long ago, Sachin's batting was not only a spectacle, it was something people would discuss, analyze and scrutinize for years. Things have changed a bit after the arrival of the Gangulys, Dravids and Laxmans and after his own loss of form. ARR hasn't really been threatened by competition in that sense, but of late, his music hardly warrants any dissection and expert commentary like before. ARR himself agreed that he was concentrating more on expanding his horizons - notably with his score for the Oscar nominated Chinese film -  Warriors of Heaven and Earth  and his work on the theatrical version of  The Lord of the Rings . Having said that, Warriors is a masterpiece in itself, even though I have only heard mere snippets. I believe it could easily send Hollywood composers on the run.  With  Meenaxi , ARR is at his very best once again, and has managed to create music that has  "Vintage ARR"  inscribed on it, if ever such a thing could be possible. Mind you, the sound and feel are vintage, since its more or less the familiar  "ARR sound"  that you'll hear, but paradoxically speaking, at the same time, that doesn't take away the lingering freshness of the music. Everything fits perfectly. Not even one song is anything short of a  great piece . These are strong words to say after only my first musical experience of Meenaxi, but then I am not rambling either. ARR's forte - the soaring vocals/harmonies, the typical steady ambient bass and strings, the beautiful haunting flute and violin interludes, the carefully constructed synth pieces and fillers, and ofcourse Sivamani - the meastro of Indian percussion, with his heady mix of instruments ...  every  iota of his music is back! The orchestration, the sound arrangement, the entire feel of Meenaxi is pure, vintage, classy Rahman. Meaningful lyrics and poetry (for a change), always a welcome prospect in Bollywood, are a breath of fresh air too! Looks like recording in a London studio has also helped a lot, not that his Panchattan Inn in Chennai would be anything less.   Yeh Rishta  - The album begins with this song, having a nice and soothing solo entrance piece. It kicks off on a lovely, dreamy note. Debutant Reena Bharadwaj, another super ARR-find, supplies amazing vocals. The integration of tabla-like synthesized drum beats and strings by John Themis, along with some peaceful sounds of flowing water add that extra bit of flavor. Seems that Rahman requested Reena to give an audition in his studio apartment in London and ended up recording the scratch version in his kitchen.  Chinnamma Chilakkamma  - The second number is an interesting piece, and has western beats on a traditional south indian folk rendition. The song almost takes you into melody music of the 50s/60s with some oldies’ style flute pieces, but then changes pace nicely to the tune of some creative electric drumming. Just notice how Sukhwinder Singh lends unusual smooth vocals to this telugu folk song, very unlike his usual high pitched notes; especially when he sings the line -  "Zindagi khayal ..." , altering the electric drumming to a peaceful transition of synth, bass and (possibly) violin interlude. Maddenning effects!  Do Kadam Aur Sahi  - This track is perhaps the pick of the album. Sonu Nigam’s rendition should rank as one of his best. The atmospheric and spatial synth sound creates a symmetric rhythm that is an ARR hallmark. If you listen carefully, it also has a short acoustic guitar lick, although faint, but  so  appropriately mixed. This is one aspect I am impressed with, of late. Since Kannathil, ARR uses a lot more strings (acoustic guitars) in addition to his more well-known flamenco-style guitaring. There's even a continous rhythm violin (almost like a rhythm guitar) going on in the background. Subtle fillers create a deep and rich sound, creating a tremendous intensity, almost giving it a divine feel.  Dhuan Dhuan  - Its Asha Bhosle’s turn to walk away with a major credit for the fourth song. She is past her 70s, but no other lady on earth has a voice as seductive and painful yet silky and smooth as Asha’s. Contains some heavy percussive beats on a hindustani-classical base as well as additional grooves by James Asher, and is one of those hardcore ARR songs that is here to stay for years to come.  Rang Hai  - The fifth track might take more time to appreciate. Its not instantly catchy, but incorporates a great Rajasthani folk rhythm for Hossam Ramzy’s heavy percussion/drums. Alka Yagnik is on lead vocals, as always holding her own, and Dellinda, a Lebanese singer, provides additional vocals for the western style rendition.  Noor-Un-Ala-Noor  - A sufi qawwali written by M.F. Hussain, this is an instant winner. Sung by Ustad Murtaza Khan and Ustad Qadir Khan, this one has everything that a classic qawwali song should have. Flowing harmonium, traditional fast-paced tabla beats and great alaaps and swaras. A virtuoso performance!  Cyclist’s Rhythm  – If anybody in Indian contemporary music can get creative and innovative, then it has to be ARR. What an instrumental piece this is. Naveen Kumar on the flute (Raag Hansadhwani?) and Sivamani on percussions. It reminds me a bit of  Taal’s   Beat of Passion , but is not plain percussion as in  Taal . This piece is supposedly filmed for a scene in the movie where the actress Tabu is caught in the street amidst bicycles. It begins with the chiming of bicycle bells and drums in the background, which then leads into a short flute masterpiece, then back to the bells, and then finally the bells fading off into speedy and thunderous drumming by Sivamani.  Potter’s Village  – Another, very different instrumental track to wind up the album; this one has a distinct middle eastern, arabic touch to it, with John’s prominent guitar and Hossam’s drums. With great use of instruments, this too is a treat for the ears.  All said and done, Meenaxi is an album with a complex set of compositions by Rahman after a really long time, rather than just popular music dished out for radio hits. Its proper music, in its entirety, given that you allow yourself some extra bit of ear-time for it.   The good old times are back. Slip on those decent set of ear phones and let the music take you over.  My life's better because of ARR. Let the mania prevail...
