S: Every lawyer I think sucks about $60,000 to $80,000 a year out of the economy so I would encourage people to go into science, medicine or business, but not law. We have too many lawyers already . . . Law is forced, and government is forced. We should keep the forced sector small and the free sector big.  Everyone loves lawyers.
