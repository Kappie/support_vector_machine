The wife promptly told him that women use twice as many words because they have to repeat everything they say to men. Looking stunned, the husband said, "what?" Women use twice as many words because they have to repeat everything they say to men.     SORE TOOTH   A new guy in town walks into a bar and reads a sign that hangs over the bar... FREE BEER! FREE BEER FOR THE PERSON WHO CAN PASS THE TEST! So the guy asks the bartender what the test is.  Bartender replies "Well, first you have to drink that whole gallon of pepper tequila( a brand of alchohol), the WHOLE thing at once and you can't make a face while doing it. Second, there's a 'gator out back with a sore tooth...you have to remove it with your bare hands. Third, there's a woman up-stairs who's never had an orgasm. You gotta make things right for her." The guy says, "Well, as much as I would love free beer, I won't do it. You have to be nuts to drink a gallon of pepper tequila and then get crazier from there.  Well, as time goes on and the man drinks a few, he asks, "Wherez zat teeqeelah?"  He grabs the gallon of tequilla with both hands, and downs it with a big slurp and tears streaming down his face. Next, he staggers out back and soon all the people inside hear the most frightening roaring and thumping, then silence. The man staggers back into the bar, his shirt ripped and big scratches all over his body.  "Now" he says "Where's that woman with the sore tooth?"      ALLIGATOR TRICK   A man limps into a bar with a cane and alligator. The bartender stops him and says "Hold on a second here - you can't bring that animal in here, they aren't allowed!" So the man says, "But my gator here does a really cool trick..."  The bartender says "Well then, lets see!" So the man whips out his dick(private part) and shoves it in the gators mouth. He then takes his cane and starts bashing the gator in the head with it. A crowd gathers around and everyone is astonished when he pulls out his dick without a single scratch.  He looks around at the crowd and says, "Does anyone else want to try?" An old lady raises her hand and says..."Sure, but don't hit me with that stick."    MAN  HIS MONKEY   A guy walks into a bar with his pet monkey. He orders a drink and while he's drinking it the monkey jumps around all over the place. The monkey grabs some olives off the bar and eats them, then grabs some sliced limes and eats them, then jumps up on the pool table, grabs the cue ball, sticks it in his mouth and swallows it whole.  The bartender screams at the guy, "Did you see what your monkey just did?" The guy says, "No, what?" "He just ate the cue ball off my pool table, whole!", says the bartender. "Yeah, that doesn't surprise me," replied the patron. He eats everything in sight, the little bastard. I'll pay for the cue ball and stuff." He finishes his drink, pays his bill, and leaves.  Two weeks later he's in the bar again, and he has his monkey with him. He orders a drink and the monkey starts running around the bar again. While the man is drinking his drink, the monkey finds a cherry on the bar. He grabs it, sticks it up his ass, pulls it out, and eats it.  The bartender is disgusted. "Did you see what your monkey did now?", he asks.  "Now what?", responds the patron.  "Well, he stuck a cherry up his ass, then pulled it out and ate it!" says the barkeeper.  "Yeah, that doesn't surprise me," replied the patron. "He still eats everything in sight, but ever since he ate that cue ball he measures everything first!"    CRAWLING HOME   A guy was sitting in a bar, drinking away. Suddenly he says to the bartender, "I have to go home or the wife will be mad".  (at this point he was loaded drunk)  He climbed down from the bar stool, and fell flat on his face. The man then said "I can't walk and I didn't have that much to drink?".  He gets up to give it another try, this time the same thing happens and he falls flat to his face. He says "I have to get home some way or the wife will kill me if I don't get home soon"!  He gets an idea of crawling home, so away he went crawling home. He crawled up to his apartment and slowely snuck into bed with his wife trying not to wake her.  The next morning he woke up  saw his wife pacing in the room. She said "you were out drinking again last night weren't you!"  The man replied "NO WAY!"  And the wife said "YOU LIAR!  The bartender just called and said you left your wheelchair at the club again last night"!    FREE SEX   Two idiots drove to a gas station in a remote district for a fill-up because they heard about a contest being offered by the patrons of the station, to anybody who purchased a full tank of gas. When they went inside to pay, the man asked the attendant about the contest. The attendant said, "If you win, you're entitled to free SEX," and the man asked how can he enter the contest. The attendant explained "Well, I'm thinking of a number between 1-10, if you guess it right you win free SEX." So the idiot filled up and asked to play the contest and said " I Guess 7" "Sorry I was thinking of 8," replied the attendant. The next week, the two returned to the same gas station to get gas. When they went inside to pay, one idiot asked the attendant if the contest was still going on. "Sure," replied the attendant. I'm thinking of a number between 1-10, if you guess right, you win free sex. "2" said the idiot. "Sorry, I was thinking of 3," replied the attendant. Come back soon and try again. As the two idiots were walking back to the car, one idiot said to the other, "You know, I'm beginning to think this contest is rigged." "No way," said the other idiot, "My wife won twice last week."
