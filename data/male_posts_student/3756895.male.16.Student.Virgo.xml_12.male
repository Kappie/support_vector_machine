After the exam, I went out with my classmates and ate McDonald's. Feeling bored, we went to play bowling... It has been 3 years since I played bowling. Lol. STILL feeling bored, we then went IP and played for 3 hours and then finally went to Kerui's house to sit ard and chill. His cosy little room made me felt as though I was at home. Lol. Wished I could just sleep there... Reluctantly, I left his house and made my way home to play SG!!! Lol. I'm becoming a SG fanatic, just like how Darius became a DA fanatic... ;) Gotta enjoy life now before my school lessons starts again next Tues. But I hope to finish my STOOOOOOPID tutorials by this weekend. Haiz... ;(
