It was a laid back weekend, I didn't have anything I absolutely had to do, and so I was able to just go with the flow.   I'm really enjoying the change in my lifestyle, the ability to change my plans, the freedom to do what I want when I want to. Is that a selfish attitude? In some ways I think that it is.  It feels like recently my life was on hold. I was spending all my time working, and trying to create a life for my wife and I, trying to make the marriage work. It eventually became apparent that I was the only one who was trying to make things work, and so eventually it ended. This has meant that I can pick up my life again, spend time with my friends, and do the things that I like to do. I feel much better in myself at the moment, things are starting to come right, and the pressures and stresses of last year are beginning to ease.  Seeing the India team sharing on Sunday night was great. It was really good to hear about their experiences,and the high points of the trip. Over the next few months they will be sharing individually about their experiences, and I will update with what they have to say.
