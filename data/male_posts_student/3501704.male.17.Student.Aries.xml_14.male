My mood is struggling, its hard for me to reamain optimistic in face of all the problems, but i will try to keep myself cool and happy.  Last sat had fun in the nite with bbq at pasir ris park with jansen and his pals. that place was infested with mosquitos and i was wearing shorts, the moral wear long pants esp when it rained in the afternoon.. had loads of fun unwining and eating the food. Saw a lot of new ppl from jansen's church, managed to get the aj badge from him in exchange for my cj pin. THanks a lot dude. Played games like erm polar bear..erm some detective game, anyway left the place at like erm 11 with jed and jun liang, jansen's pals ...but we reached the mrt station too late, last train left at like 1125..what the hell.. stranded... most of the buses had also left... luckily we managed to squeeze into jansen's car and his parents kindlly sent us to amk, from there took nite rider to town before a cab home, reached home at 0115..freaking late  sunday nothing much xcept pw.. went to town to meet group memebers, lester was also there. Had to finish up all the surveys, first time really asking pple to do surveys, learned a few tricks from lester on asking pple to do such stuff. later slacked around at macs while waiting for joanne and lingzhi who were filming pple for our video clip  Monday, tuesday zipped by so quickly, got napha pre testing, man i got to improve my 2.4 km time, mind over matter... my standing broad jump has to improve too i think the best i can get is a pass.. got to work harder, get in shape soon.  Wednesday to friday was practically lawn bowls training at scc near city hall. On wed had lunch at funnan and after training had fast food again at raffles city.Argh got ripped off, jackson bought a whooper meal with 4 bucks and i bought a kids meal with 550...blargh, anyway course quite enriching, got some pointers
