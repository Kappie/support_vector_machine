I am planning to wear all of it, including tattoos and Canadian boxers. Yeah thats right, I will be the truly patriotic "walking Canadian". I honestly love this country so much and I am so thankful to inhabit such a place. People can complain all they want, but we have it so good here. Appreciate it.  I will be out at my cousin's camp for the next few days, I will try to post tomorrow morning, or when I get home from work. I work a 9 hour shift tomorrow so I may not have time. But, I will try :)  I did write another poem I'd like to share with you all. I am really beginning to learn a lot about the way I think and dream. It's as if poetry is the key to writing it out so fluently, even if it has some sort of metaphorical point to it. It just comes out of my head, and I don't even need to think at times of what to write next, poetry is truly the language of the soul and the heart. (By the way this one doesn't rhyme)    Listen. Understand. Do. Three undeviating words. Are you able to hear? Deep in its depths?  Addressing the situation, Believing in yourself. Are you able to correspond? With its meanings so complex?  Acting upon its message coherently, In a way that is justifiable. Are you able to perservere? In a postive manner?  To protect; to love; to cherish, To bring upon; and act accordingly, To care, and to respect, Are the goals of its influence.  Possessing and judging your very own character, Are you happy? Are you forlorn? To peer deep inside yourself, To learn your very own truth.  Having meritable, yet factual attributes, Invisible to the naked eye. To assist in bringing them to the surface, is the nature of; the soul.   Â© 2004 Tyler Kuhk  That is my fictional approach to describing what I think is our soul. Hope you enjoyed. I am off to sleep now.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   "Proud To Be Canadian"
