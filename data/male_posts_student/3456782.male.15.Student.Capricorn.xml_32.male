It shall be used either for those laughs where it's not really a laugh, it's just a puff of air generally interpretted as laughter ("heh heh heh"); or those laughs where you're laughing on the inside. Basically you're not really laughing, you're just saying to yourself, "That was a good joke."    As well, I'm going to go up to someone, ask them, "Do you know what 'ASAP' stands for?" they'll reply, "As soon as possible," and I'll say, "Just a simple 'yes' or 'no' will do." Then walk away.    I've never been good at threatening people, so, until recently, whenever it came time for a threat, I would just use someone else's threat. Well "Expect a beating from a certain girl with short hair and glasses" isn't a great threat it turns out. I thought it was good when Megan used, I don' know why it worked then and not now.
