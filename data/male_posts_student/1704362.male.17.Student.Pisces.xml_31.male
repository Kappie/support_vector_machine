Anyway, I've noticed a disturbing trend in my posts of late... they all lack a certain something. I'm sure you all (all three of you who read this) have noticed it also. They all lack one thing: namely, ME.  You look at Jimbo and questions run through your head. How does he work? What makes him tick? Why am I thinking these questions when i have no idea who he is and don't care at all?  So tape your eyeballs open, strap yourself to the computer and prepare to be devastated by my brain-seeking word bombs.     I can't remember anything. It's not serious enough to be a disorder, but it's bad enough that it screws up things. Most people take for granted being able to remember their schedules, or their homework, or what they had for breakfast. The worst feeling is being punished just because i couldn't remember to do my homework, or even if i do do my homework, bring it in to school.  "You need to work harder, Jim. This homework situation is unacceptable."  How the fuck is working harder going to help me remember to bring in my homework? In what fantasy world does the amount of work i put into an assignment have any impact on whether i remember to bring it in or not?  I wish that was the worst part, but it's not. The worst part is walking somewhere... and suddenly realizing that i have no idea what i just did or what i'm about to do. I can usually grasp some memory fragment floating around and figure it out... but it's scary.     So, the next time you see me, give me all your money, shave your head and submit to the all-powerful will of your new God, Jimbo. Or you could uh... not. And run away fast.  .noissimsnarT dnE
