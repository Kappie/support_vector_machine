Brad wasn't the only hottie either.  Orlando Bloom was showing off as well.  Moving past the cute bois - Troy was a great movie.  I really enjoyed it, quite a bit of violence, but it was part of what really happened and a little hard to avoid.  They didn't dwell on the gore THAT much.  I think the movie as a whole was very good even tho it was a somewhat sad ending.  well there is one movie off my list to see ... so many left to go.  i really want to go see a movie with my b/f ... but whenever i am down there he just doesnt seem to want to.  I know he really wants to see the day after tomorrow.  and even tho my roommate want to go see that i am not going to go with him until i see if my b/f will wait to see it with me.  i havent asked him to wait or anything ... but he knows i love movies ... and that i have been wanting to see one with him ... and if he knows me at all should be able to figure out that i am waiting for him .... guess we will see.  ok so last time i talked about him on here i think i was anoyed that he didnt call .... well i messaged him that next morning like i said and just said that he missed me ... nothing else.  later that day we messaged some more and he said that he was sick.  maybe that is why he didnt call ... he never explained .. i dont think he even realizes he was sposed to call ... oh well.  only a couple messages that afternoon then nothing for a long while.  i sent another message at about 10pm (normally this is not at all late for either of us).  i got no reply.  i hope he was asleep ... it would be the only 'excuse' i would accept without getting mad (since he was sick).  today i heard from him again (still not a reply from my message last night at 10 .. nor a reply from the text i sent this morning).  it was a voice mail that basically said nothing other than he was real sick.  i sent him another text saying i hope he feels better soon this afternoon ... and have heard nothing since then.  i am just not sure what to think.  i am sooo freaking tired.  it really hasnt been a good day.  i wasnt supposed to go to work until 12:30 .. but they called and woke me up (the one day this week i had decided to sleep in).  so i went in early.  i spent most of the day (again) trying to get my linux where i want it.  i had actually managed to completely screw up my laptop so that it wouldnt even boot.  i was trying to fix that all last night to no avail.  then finnaly i just decided to blow it all away and start over.  i got a new distibution of linux (mandrake 10) and installed it.  it did some things better than redhat but others worse.  it immediately picked up my regular network card (which i never had working in redhat), but it failed to get my video driver right.  i got the video working, but as of yet have not been able to get the correct driver installed.  i also have to start over from scratch on the wireless network card (but at least now i know aproximately what to do).  i should be sleeping right now.  i have to get up in the morning to go help my cousin pick out a computer ... ugh .. to early .. hehe  hmm .. i had one more topic that i was going to put here ... but i am thinking twice about it.  first i am very tired ... and twice i dunno that anyone (except my one special friend) would even want to hear about it, lol.  Oh well maybe later maybe not.  gnight all ... sleep well ... and dont let the bed bugs bite (not that i have ever seen one)
