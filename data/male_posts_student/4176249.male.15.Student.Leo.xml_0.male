How is it that we so often forget what's *really* important to us? I feel that this is somehow becuase of the lack of emotion we are to show everyday. Every breathing moment, are we expected to mask our love? Our hearts, will they always be expected to be caged? How does one get away from one's emotions, when that person is one, raw, flowing emotion? And further more, how does one protect something small and delicate like a violet, while they are stranded deep inside of the icy grip of winter? How... A question that holds more meaning then almost any other three letter word in the english language. The question, which will reveal the answers in one's heart, is only a reflection of some truth, that has yet to be concluded. While this is only a theory, the answer still remains to be revealed... And yet the tears of one's heart can be dried, only by the unknowing of this fact. You can breathe, only becuase it is something that you can do. And we feel, only becuase it is an impulse created by nerves throughout the body, and the soul. When one shining light, that reigned for so long, burns out, *that* is the the answer. And it should be grasped, for long enough to end the eternal silence, that is pain itself.....
