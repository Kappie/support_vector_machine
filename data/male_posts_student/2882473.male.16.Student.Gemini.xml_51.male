Well, as I guessed yesterday, my legs do ache a bit, but probably not as much as last year. Just completed a game of Mind Maze on Encarta, with a bit of help from megatrobe and someone else called Dan. Errr, haven't really got much to sat, so ta ta for now.   Playing:  Mind Maze  Listening to:  General class chatter  Watching:  Computer screen  Confused about:  Some of the hard mind maze questions  Annoyed with:  Nothing  Mood:  Ok
