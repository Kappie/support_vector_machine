Jees her mom came an hour early so we kinda had to put some of *our* time on hold, which was alright, though, since I was looking forward to eating Godly ammounts of Godly food.  Kim's mom sure likes to make people eat.  No complaints here!  Heheheh the kitchen, that was fun.  But next time, make sure that she can't hear  X^O  Maybe I shouldn't reveal sensitive information......   Work today was almost non-existant.  Gary didn't pay me, but I was promised a large sum on saturday.  k'pasjfajpfasfpaj  time for NWN.
