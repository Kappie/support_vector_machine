Later a group of malay guys joined us. I hate playing with madz. They like to act. They think they so good. Anyway, one of frens made a fair tackle on one of our malay opponents. That guy a really good actor. He wanted to picked a fight with us. I being the peacemaker of the group decided to cool things down. On the whole , we played three games and lost two and draw one. I was quite happy with my performance because i scored five goals. The next day, I went to watch Van Helsing. It was not too bad. The sound effects and the action was good but the movie was short. On wednesday,I slacked around at home. Using my computer, playing games and so on and so for. I also spent time cleaning my room and thinking what to do for the rest of the holidays.I hope the next six weeks of the holidays will be more exciting especially with Euro 2004 coming up.
