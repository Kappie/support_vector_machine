He may be able to visualize whatever design and type of learning he may want to apply, and the Perseus System will be the one to adjust itself to the likes of the person, therefore the time span of learning and style will differ from each student. All in all, it's a wonderful experience for the student to learn in a different way therefore setting a exhilarating experience so that the student will want to go to school and not be lazy.  MY OPINION:  ADVANTAGES: -The system will adopt to every type of learning potential and way of the student. -The system could provide the needs of students in a fun and creative way that the students prefer. -Learning will be separate and therefore comcentrate on each student not just one to group (One-on-one strategy). -The student will be able to visualize ideas for themselves. -The time span of learning will be regulated and well adjusted. -The environment will be controlling the machine to supress their comfortability.  DISADVANTAGES: -Student's progress will be harder to record than a class based program, therefore making progress hard for the class to evaluate and compare. -The students would not be able to excel or develop skills in the things that they don't want.
