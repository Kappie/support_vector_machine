Yes, you heard me right, he worshipped Hitler and worked at a Nazi ammunition factory. This cartoon (from 1942) is called " urlLink Der Fuehrer's Face " (which was later renamed to "Donald Und Nazi Land" or something like that).     Since I had it partially downloaded, I never got to see the end, until I read about it on a  urlLink very nice review . In the end, it turns out he was just having a bad dream, and he ends up kissing a little statue of liberty, proclaiming his love for America. But you see, if you don't get to see the ending, you would've thought Walt Disney was a nazi, like I did at first. heh.  You may also know that recently Donald  urlLink turned 70 , and as expected, celebrated it on Disneyworlds around the world. There is also another interesting article regarding Donald and politics, where it apparently says that in Sweden,  urlLink there is a Donald Duck Party , that although never gets most votes, it still often gets more votes than parties for living breathing people. We're speaking of a cartoon duck here, so even a few hundred votes is still something. (Odd, but something.)
