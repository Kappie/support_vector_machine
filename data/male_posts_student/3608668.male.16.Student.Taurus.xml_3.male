She was getting ready to leave for dance camp. I went back to sleep and Josh called and woke me up around 1:00 this afternoon. I talked to Jaymie on the phone for a while today. I was pretty much on the phone all day with either Jaymie or Josh. I did talk to Holly tonight also. I am going Tuesday for sure to take my written test for my license. I can't wait to get my license. Josh and I are going to the mall tomorrow. I plan on applying for a job. Well, I'm out. Later homies.
