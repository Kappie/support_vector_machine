We visited Lauren @  Aeropostale  then went to  American Eagle . Since Katie works there, I got a mad bargain. I got a pair of jeans and a hoodie for only 40  greenbacks ! I even got the free iron-on letters. What a buy. On the way back to the car, Kate and I decided to leave our mark on Lauren's car. So we left messages on napkins under her windshield wipers.    I was talking to someone tonight, (who's identity will remain anonymous), and I just realized how lonely I am. Loneliness sucks. Majorly.Well, I have to go...be lonely...
