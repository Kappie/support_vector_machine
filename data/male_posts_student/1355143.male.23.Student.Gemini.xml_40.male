Second, I went on Friday to get a haircut the thing was that I hadnt gone to do so since BCN and I did need one. Coz' it was that day all the places were busy exept for this one fancy place. So I went there and asked to, you know, get it short on the sides, a little in the back and some on the top, and get color as I had in Spain and thats it. Well so me and the, very beautiful, hairdresser had some rather "emparesing" talk until I started feeling like she was giving me mullet so I said, you know I don't like the mullets. She replies that there were good and bad ones, and then we had a lifely conversation about bad haircuts in Iberia (Spain  Portugal) as we all sure have gotten to know. Well when she finished I thought I had a little pony tale but I wasnt that worried, just thought it was funny, she told me that on the back of my head it was most (hair) in the center (of the back of my head). Well no trouble, just something fancy...  ITS A MULLET, seriously I have been checking it out and its a fact!!! I have mullet. Ok, so I should just take some scissors and cut it myself, right? No, wrong coz' even though its horrable I have never in my life been so popular with the girls. I told you about my luck, on Friday and on Saturday my friend asked me to teach him how to hussle (like Im the master) and coz' he's the worst I went with him to help a little. We decided to start in this bar, where his friends go, but they weren't there, we just sat down and he had a little (actually alot) to drink and we chatted. Then this girl points me over (and she was cute, though her friend wasnt) I offcourse went. Well she told me that I was her "prince of dreams" and thats how she would like her husband (her actual words there and then). I thought I was getting lucky so I asked her how old she was, what she did and so on. Ok Tim don't laugh too hard, she was a 27 year old dentist assistant with husband and two kids, thats where I put the line. Then she and her friend realy liked to armwrestle me!!! Whats up with that???  There are more stories to this night, but I havnt got time to writ'em.  Later, Ãšlli
