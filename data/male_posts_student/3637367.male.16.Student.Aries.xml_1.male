What is important, is how you navigate between the two." -Frank Herbert                                                  Imagine the perfect world. Think of a place devoid of any disturbance, a pristine utopia where life is perfect in every aspect. In this world of soothing serenity, and complete relaxation, there is no disease, no pain, and no suffering. Here, there are no conflicts to struggle against, nor are there any obstacles in life to overcome. No one here need feel sorrow, anger, or despair. In fact, here there is nothing at all to feel. Imagine this “perfect” world. Do you think it is somewhere you might be happy? Think again. Despite what some may think, a world such as this is not nearly as desirable as it sounds. As humans, it is through the complications in life that we grow, and mature into who we really are. No person should want to have everything in life go their way, nor should they always take the path of least resistance. To do so is to deny what makes us who we are. A life without conflict is a life no one should desire. Despite popular belief, true fulfillment in life is found in struggle. 	Adversity is the calling card of humanity. Every person in the world faces some kind of conflict every day, and to know this, is to understand that our flaws and shortcomings are what make us human. Think of it this way, when is the last time you met someone who had no physical, or character flaws? There is no such thing as a human being whose appearance is without blemish, and who has never been faced with any problems, or obstacles to overcome in life. The question is, however, even if there was someone fitting such a description, would it be someone with who you wanted to be friends? It is through struggling against, and then overcoming our problems in life that we build character. If someone had never come across a situation where they were forced to deal with a complication, they would have no character. In fact, they would likely have	  no emotion whatsoever. Perfection is not a human attribute, it is a robot’s. In a world where everything was perfect, we would all be robots. Through facing adversity, we ascertain that we are truly human. 	Through overcoming the adversity we face in life, we come to know a sense of achievement. If life was flawless, and there were no problems to overcome, there would be no point in living. As humans, we need to feel that there is meaning, and purpose to our life. Without a sense of accomplishment, we cannot achieve this sense of purpose. True satisfaction is found in facing the odds, and winning, not through taking the easiest route to victory. Imagine you are in the Olympics, for sprinting. You have trained for the past decade without pause. The majority of your life has gone towards this one, final competition. Years of struggle, pain, sweat, and tears have brought you here, and now it is time to test the fruits of your labour against those of your opponents for the chance to win gold. What if right before the race you found out your opponents were toddlers? Surely you could win easily, but even if you did, would you feel as if you had accomplished something?  It is through struggling in a battle against our obstacles that we find meaning in our life. 	By overcoming obstacles in life, we attain dignity.  As humans, we could never have dignity if everything in life was handed to us on a silver platter. Dignity is essential for human happiness, and without a sense of integrity a person cannot have dignity. By sticking to our guns when a situation turns unfavourable, and persevering, we remain true to ourselves. Respect is essential for dignity, and someone who has no conflicts in life to overcome is not respected. Think about it, would you respect someone who had everything given to them in life? Of course not. In fact, you might think that person was spoiled. Despite what we think, by not always having life go the way we want it, we achieve dignity. It is through struggle, not relaxation that we come to discover just who we are. Adversity is what defines us humans, and it is through struggle that we come to know who we are. 	Adversity is the fulcrum of life. It is through the hardships in life, that we find true happiness and fulfilment in life. If life were perfect, and flawless, our personalities would be like a blank painter’s canvas. Perseverance is the colour of life that fills the canvas of our character, and makes our life more then a bland bleary painting. As humans, we can choose to take the road of least resistance, or we can actually live our lives by rising to each new challenge that is thrown at us. In life, we can either choose the former path and be robots, or we can take the latter route, and be truly human. The question is: what do you want to be?
