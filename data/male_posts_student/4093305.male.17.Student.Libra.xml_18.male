Also, with the burning of forests, the land becomes "savannized,"  unable to process as much CO and CO2 as before, thereby reducing the ecosystems that make our planet safe to breathe on. Some of the fires are natural and simply add balance to nature by allowing plants and animals to live later; it's just a natural part of the cylce. However, others are not started by humans and we simply cannot afford to destroy as much forest as we do because we're having enough trouble with greenhouse gases as it is. Have we no respect for  urlLink Gaia ?
