The situation goes liek (that is how i spell it from now on) this: My sister goes on vacation by herself as a reward for finishing high school (holy shit!) on time (holy shit!) so she chosses to see our redneck relatives (tho that is not to say that i am particularly sophisticated) (poor but not criminal, not smart but not dirt stupid liek [again!] some ppl i know, basically good, hospitable ppl ["we ain't got much, but what we got we share."]). I called it while she was down there. I said "she is gunna wanna live down there.". To which my parents replied "may-be." She came back not long ago and said "hey dad, (as he was the only parent in the car at the time) I was thinking of moving down to Georgia with our family, what do you think?" My dad replied "You can do what you want, yer 18.". My Mom, who found out later, was hysterical, fucking hysterical. She cried and cried. She also took the time to offend our relatives by saying "We can do more for her than you guys can.", "We can put her through college; what can you guys do?" (this is althogh she has made it quite clear that, even tho she has the cash to spend, she is not giving us any help at all, period,[Was that redundant?]since kindergarden [That was redundant]), we have more money (more direct), and so forth. Naturally, she (Gina, my half sister), is offended, she goes off the handle and says she doesn't want anything to do with my family except Melanie. Gina doesn't even want to talk to her own father because of this bs. O yah, Mom also said she would rather Melanie went to Georgia then went into the USAF, which is a good way to offend a family whose men all go into the marines, except me. I play peacemaker in this situation, and it doesn't work. Everyone will talk except Mel. Well shit, that's liek establishing a democracy without the input of the populace (wait...). More updates on thatlater.  siiiiiiiiigh. I need a new gf. I just broke up with the last about lying to me. Then she tried to keep me by saying she is pregnant. I stuck around for a negative test and left. I did not say a whole lot about the test, even tho we were protected because my family is kinda, uhh, productive. My mom had one ovary (more on that in a min), my dad had on a spermicidal condom (99.9% effective, even if broke, and condoms themself are 97%). The first time my parents fucked, there was a Melanie. My mom was married in the third trimester. My dad, not being the college man, thought my mom was sterile. He thought melanie was a miracle, a one-in-a-million shot. The very next time they fucked, there was me. (half brother danny, same thing, w/o te sterile thing.)O yah, did i mention my dad was 44? Did I mention he was broke, and bankrupt (damn!), he had a kid living with him (1 of 3) (Damn!), and that my mom was a 17 years younger blonde? (DAMN!).   Weird thing, life is.  What was I getting to? 0 j@h. Gf. McD's. There is this girl, a friend of a co-worker whose name escapes me (not much of an insult, really, my memory 5v>  Music sux lately. Well, white ppl music sux, neway. The Roots, The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Lil' Jon, and D12 (We've recently traded Colin Powell for Eminem, Em has come out as black, and Colin has come out as white, altho some some would say this is an eccentricity born into them, but nvm) have dominated my playlist lately. This is the part where I do a review sort of deal. The Roots push their seed in her bush for life in the video The Seed 2.0, I give it a 7.5. Good song, good cinematography, and so forth. Usher pulled off an awesome video with Lil' Jon and Luda for an 8.0 on my scale for the classic objectification of women/dancing video. The Black Eyed Peas pissed me off. Let's Get Retarded became Lets' Get it Started. WTF? U kent say retarded on TV? Or u are just a pussy? Lick my balls. U get a .5, just b/c there has to be space at the bottom for every pop/country video ever. D12 is still recovering from Purple Pills/Hills. If there had not been an AMC Gremlin in the vid, and if the vid wasn't actually pretty damn good if u uncensored it, I'd doc them on My Band. But as it stands, 8.5. The crossdressing got me. Kids in the Hall thoughts were provoked. I became happy, and that takes alot.  Okay here comes the shitty vids. Avril could suck my dick if she wasn't so dirty a whore, may I am not enough of a sk8er boi. Britney can go to hell, straight to hell, without her 200 mil of plastic surgery, for what she does to the self esteem of a nation, porn belongs on pay per view, and the music is better. Hillary Duff. Dammit, I already used the dirty bit. Well I guess she came clean. O wait. She aint clean. I guess she just came.   that is it. good night 1337 hH>
