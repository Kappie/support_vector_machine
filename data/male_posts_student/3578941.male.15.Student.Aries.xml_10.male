Any ways there was a bit of goodness in yesterday and that was my aunt and uncle who are coming to visit for this week got here last night.  Ya, they are cool, my aunt maried this guy like 6 months ago and he is like a rich lawyer dude, so he is cool.  Lets see what has happened today...a whole buncha nothin has happened.  I kinda happy cause my dad got some sense in him yesterday and decided to turn on the AC, ahhhh the nice cool refreshing air, paridise.  Guess thats all.
