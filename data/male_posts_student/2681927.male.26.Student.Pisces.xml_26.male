Well, they didn't until well into second half. By then the two teams had scored one goal each, both equally brilliant, by Ballack and Heinz. After an hour, the Germans got to the grip and started to attack while the Czechs backed down. Germany created a lot of chances, Ballack struck the post and one corner were deflected by a defender on the goalline. Naturally, when a team attacks furiously, the other team scores on a counterattack. This time Milan Baros got the goal.  What the Germans lacked in the Euro 2004 was a forward, one who could cut through the opponents defense. They would need a Jürgen Klinsmann, a Rudi Völler (ironic enough, being the German coach in the Euro 2004 and all) but instead they had Kevin Kuranyi.  My Man of the Match: Michael Ballack.   urlLink Netherlands - Latvia 3 - 0
