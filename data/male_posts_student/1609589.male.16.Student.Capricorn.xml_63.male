We got the elbows, the saw, rivets/bit, glue, primer, 4" pipe, but we couldnt find the 6" pipe. They just didnt have it. Turns out the instructions we got weren't completely right. DWV is what they said to get, when instead he meant NCS(or some other thing that started with an N). Well, we got it, and tomorrow were gonna finish everything that doesnt need the 6" pipe, because that's only used for the sliding portion. I'm gonna be taking pics on a digital camera every step of the way, so I'll put em in a .zip and send em out.  That's all for now, I'm gonna go plizay galaxies. See ya around!
