The article caught my attention in part because yesterday a fundraising letter from President Bush was erroneously mailed to my house.  In it, President Bush boldly argued, before asking for money, that his policy in Iraq was the stimulus responsible for the Libyan dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi's recent and much touted public abandonment of his weapons of mass destruction programs.        Porter strongly criticizes Bush for linking the Iraqi invasion to Qaddafi's recent action.  To explore the Libyan dictator's real motives, he analyzes the historic, economic and political reasons for Qaddafi's about-face, and concludes that Qaddafi renounced WMDs b  ecause he needed more money to stay in power.  Porter writes that Libyan oil revenues, employed to prop up Qaddafi's Arab "Jumhuriyat," have long been diminishing due to the UN-US embargo; a lifting of this embargo would bring Libya (1) new oil markets like the US and (2) better oil extraction technology.      Further, Porter contends that because Qaddafi "did not respond" to Reagan's 1986 bombing of his palace, Bush is wrong to assert that the Iraq war greatly influenced the Libyan's behavior.   (Porter concedes that "[i]t is possible that the Bush administration's policy did nudge Colonel Qaddafi forward," yet he refuses to explore the precise whys and hows of this "nudge.")      Porter's article is problematic for the following reasons:      1) NOBODY, INCLUDING PORTER, REALLY KNOWS WHY MUAMMAR EL-QADDAFI DOES WHAT HE DOES.  He is not necessarily the same man today that he was 18 years ago.  To remain in absolute power for as long as Qaddafi has (exactly 35 years and 1 month) requires strategy and cunning.  Porter accurately notes that Qaddafi began his quest for normalized ties with the West before the September 11 attacks; he also provides prescient conjecture as to Qadaffi's economic motivations.  (He might have added that Qaddafi is a sworn enemy of al-Qaeda, with a compelling interest in seeing the terrorist organization extinguished.)  Nevertheless, I believe that Porter is mistaken to discount the role of the Iraqi invasion in spurring the Libyan dictator to renounce his weapons programs, after decades of international brinksmanship.        It is eminently plausible that Gulf War II, the first incidence of "regime change" directly orchestrated by a Western power in the Muslim world in a very long time (excluding tactical/logistical support for domestic insurrections and coups), greatly influenced Qaddafi's actions.  Gulf War II is distinguishable from Reagan's attack on Tripoli, which came only three years after the terrorist bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut (which killed 241 soldiers and caused America to withdraw from Lebanon).  The Tripoli bombing was a substitute for invasion and it did not presage direct intervention.  It is unsurprising that a man like Qaddafi would "not respond" to the Tripoli bombing, but be cowed by the forceable removal of Saddam.  Nor is it   illogical or misleading to state, as Bush and his advisers have, that the realization of a preemptive American foreign policy in Iraq played a key role in motivating Qaddafi to forswear WMDs. .      2) PORTER COULD HAVE CRITICIZED BUSH'S "PRE-EMPTION DOCTRINE" MORE EFFECTIVELY.  He could have underlined the fact that Qaddafi and Kim Jong-Il are two very different kinds of revolutionary leaders, and that what frightens the former into acting cooperatively might encourage the latter to lash out impulsively.   Qaddafi, who is something of a Nasserite or an attempt at an Arab Fidel Castro, is more outgoing and hungry for adulation in the capitals of the Third World than Kim.  Kim is retiring, reclusive, and perhaps without much confidence in himself (unlike Qaddafi, who staged a gutsy coup d'etat to oust King Idris I in 1969, Kim, the scion of a communist absolute monarchy, inherited his position).  He has absolutely no regard for his people, and is willing to starve millions of them in order to keep his country poor and brainwashed and his "hyper-dictatorship" intact.
