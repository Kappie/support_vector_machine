On February 12, 1996 the communist party of Nepal widely known as the Maoist has started a revolution in Nepal. Maoists call this war “people’s war” because they think that the outcome of this war will benefit citizens of Nepal. The main objective of Maoism is to end the monarchy system and to make new beneficial changes in the laws of Nepal. Even though this is a very good objective to be fulfilled, the Maoists are not using the best way to bring prosperity to the kingdom of Nepal. Maoists today say that they are fighting the “people war” but I believe they are doing a very lousy job.
