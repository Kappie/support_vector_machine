As i woke up acting like i didn't want to but at the same time tired of being in bed i went to the kitchen and made my self some scrambled egg, i didnt want scrabled eggs but i screwd up i didnt mixed the eggs and i just did it the way you do for scrambled eggs. Well i ate my scrambled eggs with orange juice and some milk as I was watching the news. After that I went to the pool for like 30 min i usually go longer and with my sisiterbut this time i was alone and this man in the pool wouldn let me act as i usuallly do, diving and swiming all the way in the pool. I watched episode 9 and 10 of the Sopranos, men the first season is so cool, i also watched Everybody loves Raymond something i've been doing for the last two days for the only reason that im so bored now that Rodolfo and Adolfo left. At night i ws preparing to go to Gorettis house after talking to her for so much time about "what arewedoing tonight?" and after telling her that ihad the keys for the car. Well i decided to leave the house trough the window so i didnt make to much noisewith the door, apparentlymy mom found out about 10 minutes after i left. She called Adolfo and Goretti, she didnt get an answerabout my location,I, byConejo, Goretti's brother, found out that she called. At first i tought itwas a joke or somethin but then i talked to him and he convinced me, he told mehe had told her that i wasnt there. After finding that out i decided to call Adolfo to see if she had called him as well and she did, Adolfo heard somehtin he shouldnt have heard, about how he suppospely makes me act"different". Since i found out i was cought i decided to have fun for a while, i stayed atGoretti's until like 1:30, 30 minutesearlier of the time i had foreseen to return home. I knocked on the door twice i was already thinking of taking the car and staying there to sleep, but she did open the tirth time i knocked, she just gave me a scary sarcastic laugh and asked me for the keys, i gave them to her and i went to me before sleeping routine.
