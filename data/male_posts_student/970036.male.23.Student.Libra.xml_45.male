Normally I'd throw in a healthy dose of Gamecube to consume any productive hours I had remaining, but after a week of not playing, Nicole was so rabid to play  Animal Crossing  that come hell or high water there was no way I could refuse her subtle coercion to lend her my precious Cube.  Enter Nintendo 64 from stage left.  I haven't hooked up this 64-bit cartridge-based beast in over a year, but let me tell you, a few rounds of  Mario Kart 64  or a few levels of  Goldeneye  was more than sufficient to appease my videogame hunger. Between the two controllers, one has a loose analog stick from overuse, while the other has sticky buttons from New Year's champagne, back in 1998, over at Dean's place. But hey, beggars can't be choosers, and I can only get my ass kicked at UT2004 so many times before I declare competition against those hardcore computer nerds beyond the scope of  human  capability.    Currently: Cooking some good ol' extra spicy Shake'n'Bake!
