This portion of this particular blog should be called "Attic adeu" or some other cheesy alliteration like that. See, I don't get to sleep until twelve this morning (woah, now it's tomrrow again, must be a growing trend or something) and then I was woken up by a sweet storm. However a lamp was on and I had to turn that off. So I have this totally sweet storm with thunder and lightning and all that other stuff, and I'm to tired to watch it. Then i'm woken up yet again. I'm thinking that it has to be pretty early because my mind is still asleep and my body is kind of getting up, but not really moving, then laying back down. Come to find out it is 8 o'clock. Ugh. I creak out of bed, and I am hustled around the house by little siblings telling me that I am wanted outside. So I go outside and lo and behold the grass is wet. That's ok though, I don't really mind. I find out we are going to mount a satellite dish on the side of our house. Joy. We mount the sattelite on the side of our house with little difficulty, but now we must feed it through the attic into the house. So who gets to go up into the actual bowels of the house and fiberglass? Me. That's ok though, i wanted to go. Here is the cool part, we have this ball that is attatched to the end of a rope kind of thing, and we tied that to another rope, and then i went up into the attic and threw it down to another part of the attic where the cable was. This was my idea by the way...very genius. kind of. Now it is getting pretty hot. It got up to around 95 degrees. So now I plug in the cable to the jack and i come down. Totally awesome view, you can see the skeleton of the house. However, as I said, it is really hot right now. Quickly following after that, I come down, and it does not work. So, we unplug the cable and string down through the house. Now it works because it is the actual cable itself coming straight from the satellite to the reciever. That's nice and all, but we want it to work coming throug the cable jack up in the attic. So again, I go up into the attic and plug in the cable. Now, again it does not work. So again we pull it down through the house. And that's the way we've had to leave it. So perhaps if you know why this might be happening, just leave a comment...or follow the popular trend right now and know what could fix it and don't say anything. Out for now. Ciao
