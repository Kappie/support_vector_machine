But there was a bit of action before that.  During the day it was great cuz it was actually warm and sunny out.  In the low 80s in fact.  So Tyke went out on his deck and got some nice sun on his pasty white body.  Not much difference can be noticed but Tyke is gonna at least get some color to his skin before the week is over.  He isn't a big fan of getting burned though so he doesn't stay out in the sun for that long.  Other than that though Tyke just listened to music and watched tv while he tried to find things he could eat without hurting his semi-swollen mouth.  He will be getting his stitches out on Wednesday though which he hopes will mean that by Thursday he should feel totally fine again.  But he doesn't fully expect that to happen.  At night he watched the home run derby which was fun and then the celebrity/legends softball game.  That was funny.  Rollie Fingers made an insane diving catch to rob a hit.  If you know who Rollie Fingers is and when he played then you should at least chuckle at that line.  Tyke and Dr. Phil set some preliminary plans for the night and then later on they changed them to a later time but they still hung out.  Joining them was Kinker and Amed.  First off they played Risk.  Tyke won again!  This time he just rampaged through the world by having all of North America the entire time and not having to fight any wars other than the little African "feud" that Tyke and Dr. Phil had going in order to help themselves out.  But it turned out to help Tyke more than anyone as it won the game for him by assuring a card every turn which Tyke later turned in to win the game.  It was a solid pounding Tyke put on everyone.  Amed struggled pretty badly from the beginning when he made a hooooge oversight and didn't notice that he left his capital wide open to attack and thus Kinker took him over right away.  So he was done.  He stayed around and was put into Tyke's army but only like people get knighted by the English government.  It was all title, no perks.  Whatever, he was a happy Russian.  After Tyke's victory came poker.  They played $10 buy-ins and it was a good thing to do it turned out.  Mr. Amed once again found out tonight.  He just struggled.  He ended up losing 40 in the 10 buck buy-ins.  Tyke went up 10, Kinker went up 10, and Dr. Phil went up 20 when they decided to cash out and then play $5 games to keep Amed around.  So Amed then stayed.  And he lost that one.  Tyke stayed even (he gained a buck but then lost it on later gambling), Kinker won 5, and Dr. Phil lost one.  For the aforementioned dollar Tyke played Kinker (Dr. Phil's replacement while he learned the rules) in 31.  This is a really fun game.  It is pretty easy to explain and understand but he's not gonna waste his time doing it here.   Tyke won the dollar from Dr. Phil after playing for a while.  Then Tyke and Kinker decided to play once again for another dollar.  And after a really long time Tyke lost.  There was probably about an hour of 31 playing tonight when all was said and done.  That's cool.  A new game to play now actually.  Hopefully it doesn't go the way of Chinko.  It could but this one you can at least bet on so it is made more interesting by that factor.  And it isn't so weird and pointless either.  But Chinko isn't a terrible game either.  Oh crap!  Tyke can't remember exactly what Amed said tonight that was blogworthy.  It was something along the lines of "I don't expect to ever win" or something like that.  Basically he said, "I'm Amed and I suck at poker and Risk unless I get lucky."  That was basically it.  Basically.
