But maybe without me having to go through the trouble of designing anything, blogging will be easier.  We'll see what happens.  So what's been going on?  Well, last I left you was the winter.  I finished my spring semester at Monmouth strong, pulling in two A's, an A-, and three B+'s, finishing with a 3.6 GPA.  I'm just that bad ass.  Yes, I am aware that calling yourself a "bad ass" in an internet blog for having a strong GPA probably isn't actually that bad ass.  But, I'm just that weird.  What else has been going on...well, I'm still single.  Don't see that one changing anytime soon.  I met a girl I really liked in one of my classes, and for once I didn't hide or anything.  I actually went up and talked to her, ate lunch with her once, talked to her outside of class.  These all seem like perfectly normal things that people do on a daily basis, but they represent progress for me because I am just terrible in social situations.  I don't know why, I just am.  It's why I have a small group of friends, and why I've never really had a steady girlfriend.  I am as socially inept a motherfucker as you'll ever find.  Even among my friends...I have two friends I'd consider really good, close friends (Travis and Joe).  I have two other friends who I'm somewhat close to, but feel as though I may be drifting apart from, for whatever reason (Grim and Jeff, neither of whom I see as often as I used to).  I have two other "friends" whom I can't stand (Brandon and Chrispy).  I have my two online friends whom I've never met (MJD and Ryan).  All of my friends seem to be in pairs, that's weird.  And I have Gene, my work friend who doesn't have a pair to match up with, whom I don't see that often anymore.  That's it.  And I suck at meeting new people.  Which leads to nights like tonight.  Tonight was a Saturday night.  I stayed home and watched an SNL repeat with Donald Trump.  The reason?  Well, Joe's married and has real world responsibilities (he's a school teacher, and this is his busy time of the month).  Travis lives an hour away.  Jeff is in Indiana for some reason.  Grim...well, I really don't hear from Grim too often anymore (other than last weekend).  Brandon and Chrispy are perfectly content to never do anything with anybody, and just sit around all night on AOL Instant Messanger while playing stupid online video war simulators.    On a tangent...let me just say that those online war simulators make me sick.  These guys are sitting around killing people on their little computer screens while people are dying out in Iraq every day.  Not just soliders, but innocent civilians whose only violation was living in Iraq.  We are in Iraq, fighting a war we have no business fighting, killing innocent civilians and other human beings.  For what reason?  So stupid ass Bush can get himself reelected.  I feel bad for the families who have lost their sons, their daughters, their husbands, their wives, their fathers, their mothers...both Iraqi and American.  This shouldn't be happening right now.  And meanwhile, people are sitting on their fat asses, eating Cheetos and drinking Pepsi and simulating killing these same people.  What the fuck?  Anyway, back off the tangent.  Brandon and Chrispy don't hang out, ever.  So they're out.  MJD and Ryan, they live far away.  And Gene is also married, although he hangs out with his buddies all the time anyway, but I don't seem to be in that group.  So that leaves ol' Cox sitting at home watching TV, using the computer (because there's nothing on TV on Saturday nights because most people are out doing stuff) and wondering where everything went wrong.  I asked for a weekend day off a week from work specifically so I could hang out, and I never hang out.  That makes no sense.    Oh well, that's my frustration for tonight.  Maybe with this easy format to submit entries, I'll update this often.  Who knows.  Oh, and...time for a plug.  If you're in  Monmouth or Ocean county, New Jersey...on Thursdays from 6-9 PM I am on the X, 88.9 FM, Monmouth University's college radio station.  My shows usually range from the "comically awful," to "wow, I think I may have actually made sense for about thirty seconds there."  If you don't live in those counties, you can listen live on the internet by going to www.wmcx.com or by clicking on the link over there.  That's all for now, take care.  I will update again later this week, as needed.
