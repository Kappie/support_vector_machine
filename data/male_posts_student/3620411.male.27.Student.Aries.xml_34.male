Until last nite i was thinking about the VIRUS or WORM .. I have been recless about them coz i use auto protection from Norton Antivirus, Ad-aware6, VisNetic Firewall on my computer so I haven't been scanning the virus on my notebook lately .. guess what I've found .. 157 of the NetSky worms ..   after i got new antivirus updated rescan and delete them all :) now i am back in business .. !!!
