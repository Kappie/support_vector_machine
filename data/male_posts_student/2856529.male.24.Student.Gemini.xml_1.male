When I reached there and saw the rink (yes that iswhat a skating arena is called)I was immediately in awe of all that ice, white and gleaming in the bright lights, it really wasquite a sight. Considering that the most iceI had ever seen in my life before this, was in the freezer in our ancient refrigerator when it was being defrosted, it was quite an awesome sight. We rented the skating shoes and decided to go boldly forth where most of us had never been. Once i got onto the ice I realized that the surface was in fact "slippery as ice" and landed on my soft spot almost immediately but soon realized that my posterior wasn't as soft as I thought it was and was reminded of the saying "The bigger they are, the harder they fall."Anyway I made several brave attempts to skate, or should I say not fall down. But each time I tried to recover my balance I fell pat on my bottom. Finally I did manage to stand up straight and received numerous lessons from all and sundry advising me to stay low, bend forward and push with the back leg most of which I still can't make sense of. When I told some of the kids that I had never skated before, not even on roller blades, they were quite astonished to say the least. And another kid whom I told that we don’t usually encounter snow in India in the place I live, he in a very matter-of-fact manner asked me "So if you drink Coca-Cola don't you put ice in it?” Trying to join the skaters going around the rink was a formidable task and greatly reminded me of merging onto the Inter-State highway from a by lane while 18-wheelers hurtled down the road. By the end of our allotted time I pretty much learnt to stand up straight on my own two feet (literally) and move 6 inches from my initial position without any help, before I would start going around in circles. I walked away from the rink, my respect for ice skaters and hockey players greatly increased and a few important lessons learnt. Firstly, one must always wear plenty of clothing to protectone's behind and secondly or rather more importantly wear dark colored trousers so that one’s wet behind isn't as conspicuous in the lighting and therefore a matter of amusement to the more accomplished 10 year old skaters in the rink. Well I guess this post hasn't been of much help to anyone with regard to learning the art of ice skating but at least you now know how not to look extremely stupid skating for the first time. I say extremely because no matter what you do you will look stupid every time you fall down. Next week's session-Paintball.
