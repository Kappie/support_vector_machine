It's really quite nice.  5 Days left till Upward Bound starts, and I've been bored out of my mind for the past 3 weeks. I've been playing MEdal of Honor constantly, I believe I've become fairly good at it, especially online. Speaking of MOH...I'll post a follow-up later, gonna play mohaa(medal of honor allied assualt). Later.
