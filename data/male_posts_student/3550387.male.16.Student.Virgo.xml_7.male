She is very understanding and I love her a lot! oh yah, she just agreed to become my girlfriend lol dated 4/6/04!  Crappy, lots of homework and pw untouched and looming midyear exams are torturing me! Tomorrow will be my last slacking day, and it will be study study study! Not forgetting my promises on monday to thursday :P Miss you dear!
