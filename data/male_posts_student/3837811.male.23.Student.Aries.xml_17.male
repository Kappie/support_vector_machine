Heard that it was because of love problems.... Haiz, love had already cause the death of a lot of people, killing people because of jealousy, committing suicide etc..  Why must this happen, is really love that important?   Love is sweet, but when things go bad, everything become bitter. Ur vision becomes bitter, ur tinking becomes bitter, and u tink that u will live a bitter life forever.. I understand, i've tasted it before.. But is it really worth sacrificing for it? I really dont think so... Life offers much more than love, how about your friends, parents, siblings, relatives? Sacrificing for love in exchange for the forever grief of your closed-ones is really not worth it. Dan, not being able to know u close enough is my forever regret. I had talked to you before, sit near you before, but we just aint close... And i regretted it..        And to my lecturer, Mr Pang, who passed away a few years back.. Thanks for the guidance u showed me, you will always be in my heart.  Dan, Mr Pang, i will forever remember the times that both of you were once by my side....       Semisonic - If I Run   Morning comes and morning goes  Now it's me against the sun  The day goes by and darkness grows  And it's over before it's done   Well I know it'll be alright if I just get on the road  If I run I can free my worried mind  Yeah I know on the day I die I will lose my heavy load  But I wouldn't want to leave you behind   All my time keeps creeping on  Now I've grown into a man  But Mr. Child still wants to run  From the cradle to the van   Keep thinking it'll be alright if I just get on the road  If I run I can free my worried mind  Keep thinking of the day I die when I lose my heavy load  But I wouldn't want to leave you behind.    Current mood: Upset Current music: Semisonic - If I Run
