Next week might be a bit better. In other cheerful news, I almost broke my nose ^^;; On the same note, I haven't been able to talk to people for a few days ^^;; so altogether, things are looking great, and I look forward to what the future brings.    ~Chronos   p.s. I'm not even sure if I'm being sarcastic or not... so don't ask =P
