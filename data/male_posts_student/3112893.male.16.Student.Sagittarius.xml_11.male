All of my footnotes are more notes to self and things that I meant to put in parenthesis or after a semicolon than anything useful to the reader. I'd fix them now so that they'd mean something, but that wouldn't be as amusing to me. In conclusion, just for the records, it's not that I don't know how to use footnotes. I choose not to use them properly, ya see? I've got a feeling this will get old very soon though so I'll just use them properly from now on.  Anyway, time for something funny, and since I'm too lazy to look all over the place for funny and satirical stuff, I'll just put the address to a funny site.  urlLink The Onion  I'd list my favorite articles, but I think that this week's whole thing is funny.  That is all. -- Feanor
