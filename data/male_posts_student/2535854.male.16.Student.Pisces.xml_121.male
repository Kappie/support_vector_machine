Despite my hope of staying up to watch Euro2004,it was in vain..couldn`t wake up..oh grr..alarm rang at 3am but I told it to go to hell so I think you get the picture...anyway muahaha!Italy (although they were partly my favourites to win Euro 2004) are eliminated!Haha! Serves them right!They may cry foul over the Sweden Denmark match drawing 2-2 which eliminates them and with Sweden getting a last minute equaliser and them Italians celebrating Antonio Cassano`s injury time winner when Sweden scored.Muahaha!They have the best players in the world at every position yet they couldn`t beat Denmark and drew to Sweden thanks to Giovanni`s Trappatonni`s idiotic substitutions bringing off strikers for defenders!He is so defence minded!..I mena..why be so when hey let in a goal,you have the fire power to score another 2 or 3?Stupid if you ask me...  Despite acheiving like almost 6 or is it 7? hours of sleep,I was once again walking around perpetually stoned as usuall at school..And it was relatively a normal day..rather boring but actually not!Afandi`s antics in Math kept me ,Ck and Shahril all laughing to death and left Mr.Lee staring weirdly...and haha..Au Yong and his insulted times from Mr.Lee.haha.And Fendi`s dumb 'magic' tricks which were cheap and fake and down right stupid and funny when you laugh when something goes wrong and he stumbles and fumbles to recover his composure and make it all seem correct again and yes.Mughni or 'Mugini' as by our acc teacher,is at his sick best.Lol.wOHOO!I got 70 for agama!Amazing!Who woulda thought Id get so high!? Certainly not me!  So I got home,and slept til about 6pm..then went for that MAA advetisment recording..which i`ll descrbie in my next entry after I do some homework but should be in a few hours!  Riz.
