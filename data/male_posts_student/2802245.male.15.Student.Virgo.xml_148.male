I decided the blog can be related to anything, so it doesnt have to be with Black Ghost. Hopefully, that adds freedom :) Added Tull a long time ago, but he hasnt posted. His time is short. I mean it!  Dads got a Â£1500 to spend randomly on PCs. I have convinced him to spend it on a PC which I will build. Here are the the specs:  Pentium 4 3.2ghz | 1gb cosair PC4000 memory | 2 x 120gb Hard disks in RAID 0 | 875P Albatron motherboard >:) | geforce 6800 GT | 19" TFT Sharp  time to overclock it to 3.7ghz muwhahaha  Meanwhile must go back to messing around with Flash :)    Jamie  ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
