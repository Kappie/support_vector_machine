The Amazing Race 5 has been such a disappointment i wish that we could have a Amazing Race all star so i can see all my favourites, like Reichen and Chip, Derek and Drew, Flo and Zach, Jon and Al, Dennis and Erika, Alison and Donny... And again so sad that i have to watch The Amazing Race 5 now, now that i know the results now......
