We'll be having dual-Presidency this year with me and Maanick. The third official post is that of 'Head of Programming' and Prateek Rungta is taking it up.  Of course, everyone isn't happy with this decision. It's also not all that good for us. I wanted to be a member of the Editorial Board, but now that Exun is an appointment and one person can have only one post, that will never happen. Also,  urlLink some alumni  don't like the idea of Exun becoming official. It has its advantages and disadvantages, but I hope it's all for the best.  Cheerio --Karan
