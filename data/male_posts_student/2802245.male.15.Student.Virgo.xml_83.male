One of the constants in life.. getting beaten by your aunt... repeatedly... at a random board game... :S  The first game I lost by 2... the second I lost by about 10... the third... well... lets not talk about the third... :/  Anyhoo... I went to High Park today... Its kinda like Central Park... except its not in New York... afterwards we went to China Town in Toronto... its massive...wait that's not right... its MASSIVE, that's better... its quite funny.... even the street signs are in Chinese and you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who was white in there. It's like being in China all over again... the people the noise :/  Ah well...  Back to Able and Baker :/  Meh...
