Well, I've got one more exam to go, business, before the end of my GCSE's, that's on Monday. I havn't really revised for any of my exams, which probably makes me really stupid. I so should have revised. Oh, well, can't change it now, just have to wait and see what I get. After my graphics exam today, me Amy, Heather and Arron hung around the school for a little while until Heathers mum got there. Then me amy and arron walked off. Amy split away to go home that left just me and him. God, I love him so much. I really do. We were walkin back to his house, because my mum was like on her way, I didn't get inside, cause mum rang just before and said she was here, but I got very close. Just imagine what could have happened if I got further. He is so gay, definatly gay, I just don't think he realises it yet. Which is such a shame, cause he'd make a great boyfriend. Hopefully Gemma will organise some kinda get together over the holidays, otherwise I wont see everyone. I feel pretty good at the moment. Finally I can be myself, the camp self. I can shake my ass when I walk, talking softly and talk openly about my sexuality. What I need to do now, is really develop my personality, cause I thin it's really crap. I want to be closer to all my girlfriends. I need to be about more excitable, more fun and laughy. I need to get lots of new incredibly gay clothes and shoes. I need to get my hair looking a million times better with a bit of dye, and it need a nicer tan. If I feel I'm better looking, I'll feel less stupid getting physicaly close to others. I really am starting not to want to wear make up anymore, I'd rather have darker smother skin - fake tanning seems to be the answer to this. Once I've got a bit of cash I rekon I'll buy some dye and tanner and make myself look a lot better. I really really really need a proper job now, I'm so despirate. I need money, lot's of money to get myself some beautiful new clothes (grands worth I've picked out so far), a nice little retro italian scooter, and an iMac. With those thigs my life would be complete. I just need some damn money. I'm alredy lookin forward to sixth form next year. I'm doing photography, graphics, maths and business. But, I'm now starting to think maybe I should damp maths and go for something a little more interesting/creative. I don't really want to go back next year and do more boring maths, I don't know if I'll be able to stand it. Photographies gonna be great I think, gives me a chance to be artistic. I'm already finding myself coming up with ideas for photographs, and I havn't even started. Can't remember if I said before on here, about a fantastic university in London, I think I did. Anyway, I want to try and slip this idea into conversation with Arron some time. I know he wants or at least wanted to be an interior designer and that's what I'd like to study at AIU-London. If he knew this he might, just might want to come as well. Just imagin me and Arron go off to london share a flat together go to the same university, the same subject. I would love to do this. Arron is such a cool person, and I get on so well with him, who knows what could happen - wink, wink.
