I arranged to meet Danny at the end of the road, like we do during term time, but instead he came and called on me, stuuupid boy, mwhahahahaha i made him wait, then we watched "bottom" on DVD for a bit, then we set off for the bus stop. We got on the bus round umm 12.25 according to my dayrider ticket, so yeah we go to Manchester about 1.20ish. Then we set of to get the reason we went there in the first place  out of the way, to go to the tourist office to do some research for the company. We did that, got the research. Then we went and wandered around Manchetser for a bit. Then we went to Afflecks Palace for a bit, Danny got 10 badge thingies for £4, he was  very  pleased about that. Then we went ot Piccadially train station so Danny could look in the HMV up there for this album he wanted. He found it in that one, but it was the same price as in the other HMV store. Then we went and got the bus home. And hey presto we got off in Hazerl Grove to go see Lucy but she had already finished work. Anyways enough for now.
