It had the potential to be the crappy networks best show because the vast majority of their major shows suck like no tomorrow.  The season finale was airing tonight, and I figured they were totally gonna lay waste to the person who won. I mean, these people are so bad, it's obvious they've never taken anyone's comments into consideration. They just live in their own little world thinking they can make it without getting help.  When it finally came to tell the winner, Jaime, that she can't sing, they totally buttered it up. Not only this, but they gave her a contract anyway and $100,000!  "Treating people equally when they're clearly not equal is what, class? COMMUNISM!"  I got that quote from "The Simpsons" where Lisa takes dancing lessons.  Never the less, it proves a point, and it's that we've started to reward people for sucking it up. Now, giving her money for being a good sport is fine, but a singing contract? What the hell? Wasn't she just declared the worst singer in America?  Not only this, but they sugared it up so much, the poor stupid girl probably still thinks she's good and wasn't just declared the worst singer in the world.  You may ask yourself, "Why the hell is Grant watching the WB???"  Well, it's because it's summer and I have nothing better to do.
