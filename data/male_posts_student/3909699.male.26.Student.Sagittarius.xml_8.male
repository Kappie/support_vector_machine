Second, they now have a bigger main burger called the McBig One or some shit that costs more than the others. Third, the have the standard array of healthy crap that all McDonald’ses have been adding to their menus worldwide. Fourth, they appear to be the only internet ‘café’ in town, offering 30mins for a pound. Unsurprisingly there were no takers.  I remembered the expansive promises Blair had made about putting internet into public libraries, so headed to the public library, where I indeed found that I could fuck about on the internet as much as I wanted by obtaining a library card, which I did for free with a minimum of fuss. Apparently foreign tourists were in the habit of doing this, somewhat to the staff’s chagrin no doubt.  In the library computer room I ran into Melinda Cooper from Sydney, who was editing her paper for tomorrow. We hung out for a couple of hours later, talking about geopolitics. I offended/irritated her by being an apologist for ‘fascist’ Islamic fundamentalist movements. I am a bit worried about this, as it was not my intention.
