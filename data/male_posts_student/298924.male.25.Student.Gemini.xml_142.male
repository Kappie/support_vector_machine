I am starting to think I am one of the more shallow people I know....no substance whatsoever....  Anyway here is a major dilemma....the surgery my dad was supposed to have about a month ago got rescheduled for tomorrow....I had no idea about this until last Thursday when I am talking with my Uncle who also happens to be the one taking care of my dad....  Said uncle has a way of making me feel terrible about things as far as dad is concerned....he fusses about the fact that my sisters and I work....he says that if it was his father he would be doing a whole lot more.....he just makes it seem like I'm doing everything but the right thing....  My friends, sisters, and Mom tell me that being in Nashville and doing the med school thing is what I need to be doing....but if that is the case why do I feel so guilty about what my uncle is saying....why do I feel that I need to be in Atlanta tomorrow for my dad's surgery?....what do I really fear?....do I only want to save face in my uncle's eyes?  I try to balance things out....my sisters had a very clear and concise argument as to why I shouldn't feel as much obligation as I do....I try to tell myself, "Hey, you are a 23 year old black male in medical school, when your uncle was your age, he was getting as high as a kite"....that only goes so far....because at the end of the day things are still the same....my dad wouldn't be here if not for my uncle....  But I have bigger things to worry about....my mother's father is dying as I type this....he is in a hospice in Mississippi....I know he would rather be home....all my granddad had in his life was his family and his dental practice....he served as a politician for awhile, but his loves were us and his practice....when he had a stroke a little more than a year ago, he was lost one of his loves....a man who, every single day for decades would go to his office and do something he loved was no longer able to....I can't imagine how terrible that must feel....and now what's left?  Meanwhile I am struggling here in Nashville....I find it amusing that people think I just coast through school....I don't....I haven't.....I won't go into greater details because I'm just a secretive person that way (see it's not just about friendship and loyalty....I don't like to open up about anything at all....)....but I'll just say that last semester was not a good performance academically....and I have some major issues to resolve this week or M.D. might become nothing more than a dream....  But yeah I gotta also worry about what my uncle has to say....I can't even tell the people I feel the strongest about how I feel....I don't really feel like I can talk to other people....I don't know exactly what it is, other than I feel I can't trust people....I'm insecure and I don't know how you fix insecurity....I sit back and I think to myself, how many people can I really trust....how many people have any idea how Calvin really feels at any given moment....and right now I can't say that anyone does....I tend to give more detail to a few select people....but even then I don't let my guard down....Nina and Che know a great deal....but not everything....I used to be able to talk to my dad....I love my mom but I can't talk to her about me....I have friends around here and other places that I talk to when certain issues come up.....but I make sure I dance around them as awkwardly as I can....in short I'm a hot mess....who would ever want to take on the terrible job of cleaning me up?
