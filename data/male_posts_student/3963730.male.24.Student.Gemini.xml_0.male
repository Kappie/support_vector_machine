But when it is someone you love who hurts you by showing no love, you cannot dislike them - because you love them - it would be ridiculous! You cannot help feeling some bad feelings towards them for hurting you, butyou can't stand to feel that waybecause these feelings damage your ownlove for them.  So you ignore the feelings (to protect your love), allowing yourself to be hurt without protecting yourself. And without even allowing the possibility to leave if the hurt is to great. You make yourself a victim, and worst of all this only makes them love you less, as you become even less the person you werewho they onceloved. So they love you less and hurt you more.  There is eventually a point when you are hurt to much for love to remain. Your own love for them is damaged or broken, and you can't help feeling bad at them more for breaking your love as well astheir's.  Love works fine when you both are in love. But as soon as one decides not, then the other could love them to heaven and it would still be futile, because they can eventually bring even the highest love down by the hurt that results from their decision.  I agree, it is impossible to stay together unless both want it. But at least there are the memories of your time together. At least that is what I had imagined, but it seems that breakups don't onlyapply to now and the future, but also the past. How is it possible to breakup and keep memories? If we cannot feel those things now, how can we remember how they felt? It is asif they never existed, and that the love was erased even from those days that have already been.  A worse thought still is that, if it was truly love, then how could it simply disappear with no warning? Surely breaking up is a proof that it could not have been love at the start. But that is not a nice thought.. in that case, what was that time together. How terrible to believe it is love when it is not. Who was fooling who, was it all an act.  And the only way to move on is to not even think about the above, because to do so even a passing moment is so confusing, the complete lack of sense and reason makes me feel sick, and my head ache. It seems like the impossible question, with no answer, and yet also many all conflicting answers.  There is no certainty or security of knowing, that at least I can understand one thing or another. Because I just can't understand even one thing, and can't even begin to think without it hurting.  (a little too personal I know, and maybe I will have to remove it later, I have to admit being ashamed to write it. But I hope it at least gets some of you thinking, and recieves some responses of various views of love, breakups, life, etc.)  dave
