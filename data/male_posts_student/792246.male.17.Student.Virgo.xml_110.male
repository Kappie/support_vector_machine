[23:45] Jonathan: everyone has wisdom teeth, don't they? [23:46] Jonathan: are you some sort of freakishly freakish freak? [23:46] Eric: No, I'm just Bostonian. [23:46] Jonathan: ah.  bostonians are never wise. [23:46] Eric: I think some people don't get them. [23:46] Jonathan: that's why they wasted all that tea so many years ago [23:47] Eric: We're just further evolved I s'pose. After all, evolution always stops creatures from getting too wise. [23:47] Jonathan: i thought was death [23:48] Jonathan: i thought that was death [23:48] Eric: That sentence lacks logic. Use your wisdom teeth Jonathan! Or what's left of them. [23:48] Jonathan: oh, bother [23:48] Eric: Ah! [23:48] Jonathan: actually, i still have my wisdom teeth [23:48] Eric: No, that's what the CIA does to keep people from getting too wise. [23:49] Jonathan: aah [23:49] Eric: Hmm... [23:49] Jonathan: damn you, CIA! [23:49] Eric: Darwin never worked for the CIA. [23:49] Eric: He preferred the FBI. [23:49] Jonathan: i think Cat Lockner works for the FBI not the CIA [23:49] Eric: Always one for internal affairs, Charles was. [23:49] Jonathan: yeah. "internal affairs" [23:49] Jonathan: internal to his pants [23:50] Eric: I was thinking more along the lines of incest, but that'll do. [23:50] Eric: And Cat Lockner works for the Illuminati. [23:50] Jonathan: aah [23:51] Eric: Here's the picture that proves it:http://www.tom-jerry.de/js/006_illuminati.jpg [23:52] Eric: Though she uses the pseudonym "Taft" here. [23:53] Jonathan: and is a very fat man with a moustache [23:53] Eric: That's how I knew it was her you see. [23:54] Jonathan: ah [23:57] Jonathan: and with that pleasant image in mind, i'm going to go to bed [23:57] Jonathan: night [23:57] Eric: Night.
