Math wasn't fun.  Weight training was alright cuz Tyke won at bump yet again and the junior girl couldn't get him out.  Government was ok because of the first presentation.  English wasn't much fun but they did leave early and Tyke found out he now has a D+ instead of a D in there.  Lunch was fine.  5th period wasn't as bad as it usually is, just cuz it was shorter.  Physics wasn't much fun cuz of that damn bright light.  Oh yeah, Tyke also had to get up early to go to Physics (in the rain) to watch a stupid movie.  Purdy and Macaroon were there but it still wasn't fun.  Then after school Tyke didn't even talk to anyone.  He just got in his car.  He listened to some music as he drove home numb and barely focused on what he was doing.  He might have blinked twice the entire time.  He just sat there and stared straight ahead until he got home.  And then when he got home he just went downstairs, grabbed a little to eat, and sat staring mindlessly at Full House.  It was really pretty dumb.  Tyke wouldn't even describe himself as bored necessarily.  More of disappointed.  He hates when on days where he really shouldn't have anything to deal with, he just ends up not being in a good mood.  And there's nothing he can do.  Boy was that not fun.  Tyke talked to his mom about English tonight while eating dinner and that seems to be pretty much resolved.  Sounds like she might not even be calling Gretch.  But the result of the conversation was, "So Tyke what did you learn from this, if anything?"  Tyke gave the expected answer and that was that.  Then they just sat and ate dinner together.  And now Tyke realizes that he has to go read for English.  And that is stupid because the AP test was 2 weeks ago.  So why do stuff now?  They shouldn't be.  12 more days of school and they are just beginning to read something new.  Screw you Gretch.  Go ride your horse off a cliff.
