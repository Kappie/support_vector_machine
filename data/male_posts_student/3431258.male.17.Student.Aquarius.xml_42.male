I did and after we planned all that stuff, she may be traveling. Anyway friday will be a role play party at my house it looks like. Looking pretty forward to it.   Some extremely bad news on Valentines day (9th June). My girlfriend is going to live even more far away from me. Thats so cool! In fact, no. That makes me angry, a lot .I don't know what to do. A lot of girls interested around me here in lorena, and i have to stay alone.   Installed  Age Of Empire  on my pc and my mother's. I played a lot with simon over  Msn Gaming over at Zone.com . 1 cd is required for 3 players to play, totally awesome. It does not lag much over zone now. I remember the first time i played on zone, it was so retarded. They integrated a lot of msn messenger's features.   Currently listening to the world map music of Final  Fantasy VII  Orchestrated, makes me want to re-install it and start a new game.  Regards,  Zephyr
