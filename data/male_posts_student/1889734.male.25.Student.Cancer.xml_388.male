I had a good weekend.  My parents came up to visit for the weekend, and more specifically, my dad was here to help me get my basement organized.  If you don’t already know, our new house has a finished basement, but I have no book shelves for my vast collection.  It’s been difficult to live for the past year with all of my books boxed away and inaccessible.  In addition, the boxes have taken up space I would otherwise use for storage, so the basement as a whole has been a mess, and I’ve been frustrated by my efforts to clean and organize.  So dad came up to help me construct some shelves.  I’m inept when it comes to anything traditionally seen as ‘manly’ i.e. car repair, carpentry, etc…  I had sketched out my ideas for shelving using raw lumber, and we had agreed on a basic plan.  Considering the number of shelves I would require, it wasn’t economical to buy pre-made shelves.  In the end, the plan was to cover three walls of one room in the basement with floor to ceiling shelving, anchored to the wall for safety and stability.  I would end up with nearly 188 feet of shelving.    In addition, we built a workbench in the unfinished portion of basement, so I would have a place to sand and stain the shelving, as well as make a mess on future projects.  The table was impressive when we got it in place.  The table top is a 4’ by 8’ sheet of high quality pine, smooth and attractive, yet not so expensive that I have to fear damaging it.  The support structure is primarily stout 2”x 4” boards braced and fastened.  I could put everyone who reads this on top of that table and it wouldn’t even notice.  That part of the project went well.  In shopping for lumber, I realized I was going to have a problem.  The expense of the wood was simply higher than I had thought considering my minimal criteria for the quality of the board.  I couldn’t accept warping, twisting, or excessive surface defects.  We visited Home Depot, Lowes and a local lumber yard with the best price being $8.80 per 8’ board, giving me a total lumber budget of $240.  Not bad, but I was planning on about $6 per board.  We stopped at Menards, which was a first for me.  I had never been there, and I had no expectations of finding anything useful, given the reputation the store has here amongst the locals.  They look at it like a low rent Home Depot.  I wasn’t surprised to find that their lumber selection was quite poor, but on the way out we discovered something that made the trip worthwhile.  They had a sale going on prefabricated particle board shelving.  This was not my first choice, but I had to stop and consider the variables.  The particular color was exactly the shade I had planned on staining the raw board.  The thickness and density of the board were idea, and some experimentation with the 8’ lengths in the store suggested that I would have few issues with strength and bowing of the shelves under a load.  Finally, the price - $5 per board!  I would save money, avoid the chore of sanding and staining 200 feet of wood, and get some of my shelves built today rather than in a few weeks when the labor was complete.  So we purchased their entire inventory of 34 boards on the spot.  After making two trips to get it all home, and another hour of hauling them to the basement (they are quite heavy), we got started on the project.  There are some issues with assembling particle board, as it does lack the resiliency of normal wood when it comes to holding a screw, but we managed to cope once we understood the limits in screw size and depth.    We managed to get half of the project assembled and installed.  Each bookcase ‘unit’ (there will be five total) is anchored to the wall in the support studs using brackets.  The brackets also give each shelf some additional support.  In short, someone could climb the shelves like a ladder without fear of them tipping or falling apart.  I’m very pleased with the end result in terms of strength and aesthetics.  I’ll get a picture for those that are interested.  The rest of the project will have to wait a few weeks until I can get my dad back to help.  I could try to do the rest myself, but it requires two pairs of hands and some strength to lift them into place.  Finally, I am growing more frustrated in my Linux experiment.  I haven’t had much time this weekend to play with it, but after trying a few simple things in regards to my scanner, I decided to stop trying until the proper book arrives from Amazon, later this week.  Linux is just fine for simple things like email, web browsing and chatting.  OpenOffice is a fine MSFT Office substitute.  But when it comes to configuring hardware, installing packages or modifying settings, it is nothing like Windows.  Unfortunately, the book that got me started turned out to assume a basic knowledge of generic Linux, only trying to teach me the new version called Fedora.  So I ordered a more basic book and am waiting on it to arrive.  So until then, I’m somewhat crippled in my PC use, but if you look at the disaster of my basement at the moment, I have better things to work on.  So that’s it for my long, pointless post.  I hope you were at least entertained.
