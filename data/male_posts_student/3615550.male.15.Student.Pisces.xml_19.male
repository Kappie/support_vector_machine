It has occurred to me that as the administrator of this blog, I really shouldn't be posting so many comments.  The posts are my voice; I should leave the comments to be yours.    This applies mainly to the political posts.  As more people visit this blog, there are bound to be disagreements, and I should not hijack the comments threads.  Instead, I want you guys to duke it out.  If you disagree with someone, tell them so on the comments page, and tell them why.  Please be respectful, of course, so as to foster a good debate, but don't be afraid to disagree.  Just wondering, do you guys have any suggestions for my blog?  I'm still working to improve it however I can, and your input would be quite welcome.  Be blessed! Neo
