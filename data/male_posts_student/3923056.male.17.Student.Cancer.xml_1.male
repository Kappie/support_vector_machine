A 20% increase since 1980!! Over 37,000 cases. Child abuse or neglect? Is it because the previous generation of kids never learnt responsibility nor about parenthood?  this is pretty serious. i mean, 20% increase since 1980. are the morals and/or beliefs reguarding responsibility degrading as time passes? or are we turning a blind-eye to these things? i think, as a society today, we should look at our collective morals and standards... ...urgently.
