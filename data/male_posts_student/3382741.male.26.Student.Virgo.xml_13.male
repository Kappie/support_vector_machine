Several of my friends came out to suuport me last night in the meeting.  7 people showed up (2 I had never met before and 3 I have known a very short time and 2 i am rather well aquainted with [and one of the last 2 happens to have been my b/f not too long ago]).  I could tell the members of the church were afraid that my friends were going to cause a "scene", but they knew I did not want that.  They sat there through the whole 2 hour meeting and didnt say anything even though I know they had much they wanted to say.  They showed that "those people" (i e gay people) can be just as reasonable and considerate as anyone else (usually more in my experience).  I think my friends behaved a lot better than the people of the church.  I want to thank them all for comming out to support me.
