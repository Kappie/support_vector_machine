What a whirlwind of a week, it seems like just yesterday I was nervously attending my first class.   Let's backtrack a bit: First day, I didn't even expect to take the course at Don Mills... I phoned at 8:30 in the morning asking if I would be transfered to some other pool, or if it was cancelled altogether, then the lady said "the pool's open..." ...  oO;;    Luckily, my dad was there, so I got a ride to Don Mills Collegiate pool, around 1-2 mins before class started. My friend was not as lucky and came 10 mins late (we registered together, and when I told him that morning that it was open, he'd just awoken).   I've been to Don Mills Collegiate exactly once (varsity chess game), so I kinda knew the bus route. Well, I ended getting rides back and forth tho... my friend would drive me there in the morning, and my dad drive me (or us) back.   The pool itself was kinda small... and the lifeguards there were bored and cramped in that stuffy office. That's why they spent some time racing each other on wheely chairs... oO;;   The pool's depth reminds me of L'Amoreaux, where I usually go swimming (I went for rec swim a few times there this summer), but NLS wasn't offered at L'Am.    Now for the actual course... it was kinda straining: we learnt new stuff and was expected to do it right after, we had to memorize a bunch of sequences and stuff. We watched some vids and took notes... we had like 2-3 quizzes during the course (I don't think any of them were that serious). We had to treat spinals (land and water), do something called the Pia carry, save submerged victims, and practise lifeguarding.   The one item I was afraid of failing most was lifting the 20lb brick from the bottom of the pool, then surfacing and carrying it back to the side of the pool.    We also had some problem solving things that were kinda unrelated to the course... like how to carry someone from one point to another without that someone touching the water. The condition was that we can't move if we're holding that someone at the point... so it's basically teamwork and problem solving... pretty cool.   There were some interesting people there... (out of our class of 16, 15 passed - the one that failed couldn't do the brick) 3 people there takes air cadets, 2 goes to UTS, 1 person went to my old school (brebeuf) and now goes to the current school (don mills). Some people were already swimming instructors. Our instructor was pretty cool too.. he was pretty funny and I think we all had a good time despite the fact that the course was tiring (well, for most of us).    We have like 2-3 breaks everyday. A 5-10 min one in the morning, and in the afernoon, and then the 45-60 min lunch break. During the lunch break, I went to the Instructor's course classroom, and found Aaron and a person from my old Bronze Cross class. Which was pretty cool. The person from my old Bronze Cross class had a MT t-shirt and helped Piro during CNAnime... cool, eh? ^^   After my first class, I had to buy a Fox 40 whistle - which was like any other whistle, except without the ball inside, so its waterproof. I also knew I needed a bigger bag, so I took a bigger bag out from the closet. Your bag was put to good use, thanks Keane ^^    Also, after 1 day, my swimming trunks changed from green to brown... oO;; (it had stayed green for an entire year)... and then orange later in the week. Almost everyday when I came back, I would exercise a bit, then study. And have like a 15-min break sometime. During my exercises in the basement, I think I've developed a kinda fear for bees... I found a live one and a dead one down there. I disposed of both a bit aferwards... but took  me awhile.    Oh, and I went out to see Mars at 10pm one day. It was only a bright light... brighter than the stars around it, but not bigger... I'm going to try seeing it at midnight tonight to see if it makes any difference.   Today was a bit of a good luck/bad luck day. The bad luck being I forgot my goggles at home (on the last day too!!! @-@), the good luck being I passed my course anyways (I borrowed my friends goggles for awhile, and sometimes I went in the water with my glasses). Bad luck being going home after waiting 1 and half hour for my dad to pick my up. Bad luck being I shattered a glass today. Good luck being I only got a small, superficial cut.    But... I passed NLS, and that's all that matters! ^^ (... at least until I get over the fact that I passed NLS!)   ~Chronos   p.s. it's weird cause I thought I wouldn't pass. There was one thing called the "DNS swim", where you have to swim, then do a surface dive, Pia carry the DNS (drowning non-swimmer) to the side of the pool. I tried the DNS swim a few times with "ok" results, and my instructor told me to do it again. So I did, and I did fairly good that time. But my instructor said he wasn't watching (and sounded fairly serious).... then I didn't have time to do the DNS swim again. And yet I passed. Yay!   p.p.s. the chlorine smell, minor scrapes and bruises are going to take awhile to get rid of =P I think everyone in the class had minor scrapes and bruises by the end.    p.p.p.s. school's almost starting, yay!
