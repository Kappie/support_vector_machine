But I make a profit of three and a quarter cents an egg by selling them for four and a quarter cents an egg to the people in Malta I buy them from for seven cents an egg. Of course, I don’t make the profit. The syndicate makes the profit. And everybody has a share.   And the people you sell the eggs to at four and a quarter cents apiece make a profit of two and three quarter cents apiece when they sell them back to you at seven cents apiece. Is that right? Why don’t you sell the eggs directly to you and eliminate the people you buy them from?   Because I’m the people I buy them from; I make a profit of three and a quarter cents apiece when I sell them to me and a profit of two and three quarter cents apiece when I buy them back from me. That’s a total profit of six cents and egg. I lose only two cents apiece, and that’s how I can make a profit buying eggs for seven cents apiece and selling them for five cents apiece. I pay only one cent apiece at the hen when I buy them in Sicily.   In Malta, you buy your eggs in Malta, not Sicily.   I don’t buy eggs in Malta. I buy them in Sicily for one cent apiece and transfer them to Malta secretly at four and a half cents apiece when people come to Malta looking for them.   If you could follow that, then you may be just as crazy as Milo and Yossarian. Yossarian is the main character of Catch 22. For those that have never heard the saying ‘Catch-22’, it is like a paradox. An example of Catch-22 is:  You have to be crazy to be grounded from flying more missions. Officers are supposed to ground crazy people when they ask to be grounded. You are no longer crazy if you asked to be crazy because you would have to be crazy not to ask to be grounded from flying the combat missions.   Catch-22 the book takes place during World War II. This book is banned in many schools because of crude and sexual points. This may have been the best book that I have ever read before though. This book keeps your attention from title to the last words.
