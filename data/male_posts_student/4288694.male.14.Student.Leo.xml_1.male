Sorry about the invective...anyway, hope you enjoy the lyrics.   Angels brought me here by Guy Sebastian    [Verse 1] It's been a long and winding journey, but i'm finally here tonight Picking up the pieces, walking back into the light Into the sunset of your glory, where my heart and future lies There's nothing like that feeling, when i look into your eyes...  [Bridge] My dreams came true, when i found you I found you, my miracle...    [Chorus] If you could see, what i see, that you're the answer to my prayers And if you could feel, the tenderness i feel You would know, it would be clear, that angels brought me here...  [Verse 2] Standing here before you, feels like i've been born again Every breath is your love, every heartbeat speaks your name...   [Bridge 2] My dreams came true, right here in front of you My miracle...   [Chorus] If you could see, what i see, you're the answer to my prayers And if you could feel, the tenderness i feel You would know, it would be clear, that angels brought me here...  [Bridge 3] Brought me here to be with you, I'll be forever grateful (oh forever Faithful) My dreams came true When I found you My miracle...   [Chorus] If you could see, what i see, you're the answer to my prayers And if you could feel, the tenderness i feel You would know, it would be clear, that angels brought me here... Yes they brought me here...  If you could feel, the tenderness i feel...  You would know, it would be clear, that angels brought me here...   And...  My immortal by Evanescence  I'm so tired of being here Supressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time can not erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me  You used to captivate me by your resonating light Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time can not erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me    Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance.
