In the end you just feel worse than you did?  Thats how i feel right now.  somethings seem right, but i'm not sure. its like the world has spit me out onto another planet. Now the reality check comes.  You get slapped and then you realize how stupid you are.  It hurts. A lot. I feel like the title...... Have you ever felt like you cant get away?  people are always looking over you shoulder and wont leave you alone.  Thats the way i feel right now.  I cant use my computer, my cousin sits and looks at it.  My sister too, just sitting there minding my own business. My mom and dad are never home.  i just need a break....HERE COMES SUMMER.   good night
