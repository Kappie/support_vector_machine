I'm seriously just sitting here listening to Ward of the State 2 by Askari X, I'm so bored I'm going to write the lyrics down and send them to Ohhla.com.   Even though the song ends in what seems to be the middle.  Community service was crazy, there was like 30 people in our section of the food bank, and it was really a small section but it was cool because their were lots of girls there.  What was really funny though, is their was these 10 or so black guys/men who were lifting all the boxes, and then these four white kids came over to help, but they were like small and these black guys were pretty big.  It looked kinda funny..... But I have a weird sense of humor.
