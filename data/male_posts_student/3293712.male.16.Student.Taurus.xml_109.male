It is going to ruin my day, because I still have to go to bed early to get up by noon, and by the time I get off work I won't feel like doing anything.  My house is too hot to think. It must be 95 degrees in here, and my room is probably 110. It sucks.  I went to Pirate's Cove today with Bryce, Houley, and Hobe. Due to the heat and rain, it also sucked.   I don't have much to blog about today, I just realized. Being as it was too hot to think, I didn't do much thinking.  God, Brainerd sucks. First it is too cold to do anything in the winter, and now it is ninety degrees outside.  It's too hot to listen to music, if you can believe that.  I'm going to take a cold shower, and if I am cooler then, I will continue to blog. If not, I will tomorrow.
