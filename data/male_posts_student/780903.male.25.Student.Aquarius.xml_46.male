So HOW did the attorneys on the panel make it all sound so BORING?  They were so dull, so unenergetic, talking about how really sports law is just another kind of labor law, and uninteresting blah blah blah.  They actually made their jobs sound dismal and horrid.  And if it's dismal and horrid doing sports law, then imagine non-sports corporate law.  AHHH!!!
