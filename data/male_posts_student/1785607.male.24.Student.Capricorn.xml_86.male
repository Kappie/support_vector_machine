As yesterday wrote about change, I got to think more about it at night. Memory does change. It does not go from 0 to 5... it fades, it moves, it lingers there in a subtle way, just waiting for something to wake it.  As in any blog, all comes to what we live. What we think. What we ache, cry for. What we cherish and loathe. Dreaming last night, I woke up with this feeling of loss. Neil's and Adrian's faces fade of my head. I am not being able to dream them. Lines and colors are gone, sensations are lost. I can't remember the feeling of their embrace, their mouths and warmth. This guys are the one that I cared for, the ones I loved, and ... still do... I woke up sad, lost. Their faces were a blur in my dream, a blur so painful, so sad. I want to remember, I don't want to lose them here [ in my head ] too. But "everything" changes. Memory fades.  Cry te lost but remember the good.    urlLink    ... urlLink
