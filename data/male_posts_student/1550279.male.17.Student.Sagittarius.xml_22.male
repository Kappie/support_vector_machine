Actually, it's the only movie this summer that I've seen which I won't be getting on DVD when it comes out as a result of me hating the movie (see my note next to  The Terminal ):    Van Helsing  Troy  Shrek 2  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  The Day After Tomorrow  The Terminal (Won't be getting on DVD since it's not a movie I'd watch all that often, but it was still good)  Spiderman 2  King Arthur  I, Robot  The Bourne Supremacy  Catwoman   About time to eat lunch and then I'm going back to CPL for a few hours. They better not be showing  The Village  there....
