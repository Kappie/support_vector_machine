Therefore, it is a BIG deal in Masonland that I've not only read a book on my own accord this summer, but I'm finishing novel number two in my spare time, and.. and.. (drumroll please) no more than 10 minutes ago I finished reading a 600 page textbook.   For the first time in my entire life, I read the ENTIREtext, cover to cover, exhibits, figures, side-notes and all. I can officially say I read the first page through the last, and I feel quite accomplished. Sure, I've skimmed textbooks before, I think we all have. But it was quiterefreshing to actually read the last line of the textbook and know that I had completed 600 pages of information in a matter of a few weeks. Might I take a minute to pat myself on the back? I think I will. :) I feel good. Ifeel real good.
