Didn't find her, didn't know where to look or if she was even THERE, but I'm proud of myself for looking.  Have to make a very important decision about my life soon, or ask questions to nullify the confusion I'm in. There are certain possibilities from something I've been asked, and I don't want all but one of the possibilities to exist. Bugger.  I've been very ill today.  Talked to Fi a lot at Zoe's party. Zoe's party was good apart from me only getting an hour's sleep. Meh, that's what you get if you sleep next to a fish tank with a light in it.  Taken a lot of pics.  Got into town 10 minutes too late to pick up my photo CD from Klick. Bugger.  Quote of the day: "Fuck."  From   The Sleepy Cat Song   Love, Jon Roskilly
