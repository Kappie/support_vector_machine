At the last update,I begged to leave some comments here. But... Should I contenue this site?  By the way,"竹下" Can you read this? This is a common Japanese family name. First letter means 'banboo',and second is 'under'. So we can imagine there ansentors used to live under trees,especialy "banboo" There was a prime minister who has this family name.  Why did I write this? The reason is...We read this "TAKESHITA"OK? Do you understand? LIke this,between languages,there are something that gives me 'shock'.  I want to tell those. And I want to know more... If you...no,no,I have to wait more people who visit. See you!
