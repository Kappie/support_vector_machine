Seeing we were hitless through 2 innings, I felt it was a great night. Myself, I went 2-4 and got robbed in the 6th(our games our 7 innings). I saw the outfield had played me in, and we playing me to pull, so I hit one straight up the middle. The score was 12-10 at the time. Runners on 2nd and 3rd, and I hit it well. Too bad it was caught because the left-center fielder came out of nowhere and barely made the inning ending catch. I felt no shame though, I did the best I could. It doesn't help that in the bottom of the 7th 2 guys pop up in foul territory and then the 3rd grounds out to second to end the game. Oh well I guess, we did the best we could to make it interesting. 1-5 is our record. GREAT! Well I'm hoping work goes well tomorrow, and on Wednesday I can go hit up some fireworks. It outta be a great week. Another thing about softball, I am now hitting 8 for 12 which matches my season hit total from last year. I went 8 for 24 last year. Great to see I'm hitting a little better. Well I'm down to 11 or 12 dollars for the rest of this week. YAY! I think I'm going to cash in the change tomorrow sometime. Hopefully I don't go broke this week. Later everyone,  Big Pimpin' J (I wish)
