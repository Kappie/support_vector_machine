You're probably wondering "Ok Peter, what ghetto fagtard pissed you off now?" But actually, that's not it. Today, my dad has fallen victim to the ghetto of twinbrook (My nebiourhood/development's name for those of you non-locals.) My dad's 20 ft, 70-80$ aluminum extension ladder was stolen. First, earlier in June, my mom's bike was stolen. I was able to recover it near my girlfriends house. Then, later in June, my nebiours kids turtle  mysteriously  disappeared. Now I'm not saying it was stolen, it had 4 legs and could of picked up and walked off just as easily as a dog or cat or other animal. But would a turtle that was perfectly happy in a pond, want to leave? You decide. Tonight, my parents went for a walk, and talked to another woman who has a pond. Her turtle is also missing. Strange? I think so.    Now let me tell you this to tell you something else : A few days ago, my dad's friend was taken to the hospital. That's why my parents walked down there. My dad asked this black girl if she knew what happened to the man they took away in the ambulance. Her reply was : "I think he got shot by the F.B.I." F.B.I? Shooting a 80+ year old man? I think not. That was quite possibly the most retarded thing I've heard all summer. It's time to move. Anyone wanna let me move in with em?
