I am still used to have Recess as a meal so I still eat around that time in the day when recess would roll arounf. I will have to go back to this routiene in September anyways so why not just stick with it so that you never have to get back into it. Did what I write then even make sence? In my mind it does but anyways. Well yesterday where I did not post Dustin came over and I did him off a couple of CD's. I went for a bike ride into get him and we stopped at subway and the pool. After Dustin left I went with him on the ride home and I got Chris and we came over here and watched some TV and well before we came here we went to Irving and looked around at the movies there. But where it was Monday I have gotten to the point where I have seen a majority of the good movies at Irving so like the only day I rent movies is on Tuedays when the new releases come out. That reminds me I should call up and see what came in. But also later on today I have a Softball game in CB well I do not actually play but I keep score so that is fun for me. Well that is about all I have to say for today, Until next post!
