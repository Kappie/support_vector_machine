On three separate occasions I have been walking along Scary Path only to see the back of someone standing just off the path and hear a sound that one does not expect to hear while walking to campus. The first two times I just averted my eyes and hustled on by, but the last time some fellow had completely straddled the path.    So who are these people who are these people who just can't wait? Well, in each case it was a thirty-something guy wearing a baseball uniform. Understandable since the park is used for slo-pitch each afternoon. But the games had not started yet! I can only assume these people are coming straight from work, yet have not the presence of mind to use  actual  washroom facilities before leaving.  I should  also  note that the park does provide washrooms nearby. What are these people afraid if they hold it in for 5 minutes they will get Uromysistisis poisoning and die??    Ridiculous.
