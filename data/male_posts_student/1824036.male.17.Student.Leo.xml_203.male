I burned a coffe can lid (we stuck all the stuff in the coffee can itself), some plastic forks, and some straws.  I tried to burn a golf ball with not much success. I did get it to light for a minute or two. I like to burn stuff. I would love to make cool melted crap art :)...I would call it modern art and sell it to people for $500 and make a 1234507503071% profit :)...  Maybe not, but at least Im optimistic
