My character has a rounder look to it, the rounded look of a man who walks around the circumference of the stadium with deep-rooted circumspection. 'It doesn't matter' or does it?  EURO 2004 is finally upon us, after much hype, and no end of talking, the ball is now rolling, rolling towards a swift conclusion, after which the ST.George's flags will be buried away, with it the nationalistic pride of a once great empire that now only unites in the name of football. It is astonishing to see how much passion is involved with the game, and how great an emphasis placed on fleeting sporting success. I can see the dynamics behind falling in love with the 'King game', declaring your devotion to the cause of the country by adorning everything in red and white. People for once can rightfully feel proud, share a common vision, know that there is a definite objective, and begin forming bonds of solidarity that espouse togetherness. That togetherness is nonetheless nothing short of a mirage. A togetherness of pipe-dreams dreamed up by utopians on opium. In a society that is fragmented and broken, where people run after their own desires, the figment of unity is perceptible when a setback arrives and defeat is experienced. Idolisation turns to blame and slander. Hope and Optimism gives way to deflated depression and emptiness. The hero's only remain so, if they are heroic in victory.  The deep cry of the fervent football fan is to belong, to be a part of something, to play a role in a success story, sharing in the glory of victory. You often hear a football fan say: 'We beat the Irish Today', and that 'we' most certainly includes 'you', 'you' are in the 'we' that beat the Irish, and so you have access to the taste of victory. You are in a position where you are able to credit yourself with honour for an achievement accomplished by others. In a state of passivity, sat on the couch, with beer in hand, your 'extended family', the 'water-carriers' and work-horses are the propellers who possess the capacity to take your ego to dizzy new heights. Postmodern football fanaticism serves only one purpose. An opportunity to exhibit your winning credentials, partaking in success regardless of your inertia, an inertia that renders your support meaningless. Winning has to come instantly, defeat is not tolerated. The football fan grumbles and moans in defeat, no longer identifying with their team. When victory comes, they are happy once more to bite into their prawn sandwich and bask in the glory of victory, recognizing that a part of the success should be attributed to them. The football fan sees himself as the yeast that makes the dough rise.  It has passed into footballing folklore that the invisible 12th man has an uncanny ability to influence games. The illegal 12th man is made up of turnstile fodder who come to be entertained, masses of people who only 'sing when their winning'. Commentators often remark on the added bonus of the 12th man factor, eulogising about the 'Hell's Kitchen' atmosphere in Turkey. The 12th man theory may be compelling to some, but it has its shortcomings. Due to security reasons the fans of the away team in a keenly contested local derby have not been permitted access into the stadium. The atmosphere is one of hostility, the away team are reduced in numbers when Russian import Kickalumpakov is dismissed for an innocuous looking incident involving Gucci handbags at no more than 4 paces. The home fans are going beserk, their rhythmic chanting and thumping drumming is incessant. In fear, the referee buckles beneath the pressure created by the 12th man, deciding the become the 13th man. With no vocal support, apart from the booing ringing in the ears, the away team with 10 men, escape from the fire-bowl of hatred with a victory. May we lay to rest the myth of the 12th man.  England versus France. When the titanic battle of nations unfolded before us, it wasn't merely a question of footballing supremacy. In international football when rivals lock horns the cold war climate returns, people begin reminiscing about former glories, reflecting on their political ideals, wishing to stand in the gap for the nation state to uphold their sovereignty. Football is politics. Football provides the perfect arena for the warriors of the land to assemble, uniting to defend the common ideals of the land, fighting to preserve their own order, establishing earthly Kingdoms that will vanish. The English plead for God to save their Queen, wanting to retain their monarchy, being set apart as a nation with a heritage. The Brits also want to rule the waves, to have the power of former days, building an empire founded on a lust to master and control. The stench of pride lingers in the air when supposedly 'great nations' engage in combat.  Liberty, Equality, Fraternity! The French Revolution was a rebellion. Liberalism brought freedom to be enslaved to your own selfish desires. An unconstrained freedom that deceitfully calls itself freedom, never telling you whether a boundary line exists, pretending that 'wrong' can be 'right' if only the 'wrong' feels 'right'. The French fought for principles that already existed, being practiced in the Kingdom of God. In our pride, we begin looking for answers through our own intellect, because we wish to be the problem-solvers, the great-minds who remedy the ills of the world. An over arching desire for equality, its endless pursuit, blinkers you from the effects of the means used to achieve the end result. Equality is the dream, or sameness you may say, of freedom, who can say. So, a violent extermination of those who resist equality, will herald a new era of equality? When you kill somebody, the exact message given out is this; 'you are not equal', your subhumanity and difference warrants death. The French wanted a brotherhood who would create their own heaven on earth. A heaven void of God, ruled by essentially 'good' people who knew how to achieve equality.  The French Revolution did not deliver. Its promises failed. Its protagonists are dead. Its philosophies empty. Its legacy crumbling. Why? There is no life in the message, no future, no hope. The French Revolution did not realise, that what it aimed to achieve, had already been achieved. It tried to repeat the impossible and failed. The Cross of Calvary speaks of a monumental achievement, an act of obedience, which brought a mission to its conclusion. 'It is finished', and all was accomplished, there was no need for the futile attempts of the French Revolution to usher in a kingdom founded on rationality, the deadly enemy of faith. When faith is replaced with rationality, hope disappears, the vanishing hope leaving a vacuum to be inhabited by a voice of reason that proclaims man-made prophesies about a glorious future of progression.  It is a truly wonderful desire to belong, to be set free, to know true equality, to boast about the achievements of another. But have we access to the promises through the French Revolution or the revolution of the heart. The revolution of the heart turning your focus to Jesus Christ by Whom all has been accomplished. "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free" Dynamite! "Don't show favouritism. Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes, have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts." Equality par excellence! As for the brotherhood, it is from everlasting to everlasting, a bond of true unity, united in Christ, to share in his riches, and finally know that you belong.  From football to here. A meandering road. Well, when ZZ next strikes a double against your beloved country in the dying minutes of the most important game in history. Remember. Perspective. Leave the sofa behind, smile to yourself, open a tin of pineapple chunks, and eat. Saying to yourself; 'It's a funny old game!'    "What was ideology? It was and remains a system of ideas that are usually goal- directed. Thus, it is a theoretical explanation of the world's situation and a prescription for improvement or radical change of that situation. In this sense, ideology is rooted in historical consciousness, in an awareness of mankind's progress through time and how that progress might be redirected toward an alternate objective. Most ideologies are, therefore, fundamentally political, bright descriptions of the means and methods by which the instruments of revolution, party, or government ought be used for the purpose of social change.  Ideology is, in a way, the secular equivalent of theology. It directs the believer's attention to a perfected future when present woes will have dissipated and social harmony will reign. The future, therefore, holds the promise for the ideologue that heaven holds for the devout, religious-minded individual.  The introduction of ideology into the modern world was one major effect of the new secular spirit of the eighteenth century. Once society was deemed to be man- made--and here the influence of the Enlightenment is noticeable--then it could be changed. Ideology was the prescription for that change. And the force of ideology was felt throughout the modern era.  In sum, the French Revolution did many things, unleashed new forces, destroyed old ideas, offered new promises. Not the Revolution itself, of course, but the people who made it.  It was during the Reign of Terror, 1793-1794, that revolutionary tribunals meted out hasty justice. Opponents of the regime, revolutionaries themselves, fell beneath the blade of the guillotine. This was the awful period in which "the Revolution devoured its own." Some eleven thousand individuals died as enemies of the state, and their deaths added up to a new, horrendous activity of modern Western civilization: institutionalized violence, the harsh elimination of political opposition by the state. Later, Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany would cause the figures of the French Revolution to seem small. Unfortunately, the mass age would also mean mass annihilation."
