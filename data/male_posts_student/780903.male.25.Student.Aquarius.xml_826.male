A day spent with my Constitutional Law casebook, the 2003 supplement, the syllabus, and a big giant spreadsheet has yielded the following discovery: I'm probably responsible for understanding the consequences of no less than 394 Supreme Court cases on the final exam.  It's an open book exam, so this is less onerous a task than it could be.  But still somewhat un-fun.  And, just to run a gimmick further into the ground... how about a finals-themed Christmas parody song MEDLEY?!?!  Frosty the classmate, didn't work as hard as you With a brand new casebook he never read, and no doctrine that he knew But Frosty the classmate, was as lucky as can be Wishing for the best, went to take the test, and it all was pol-i-cy.  And somewhere in old Frosty's head, an article he'd seen, Was right on point and Frosty made an A-plus look routine.  Oh, Frosty the classmate, learned a lesson on that day When the friends who knew, all the work he didn't do Beat him up and ran away.  Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump, look at Frosty bleed. Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump, next year he might read.  ...  Rudolph, the Red-Penned Teacher Had a stack of tests to grade Last day before the grades due Instead of working hard he'd played  All of the other teachers Spent their winter breaks at school Reading a hundred papers Curving to the 1L rule  But Rudolph had not read a word And the break was done "I'd sure like the students' praise.  Maybe I'll give them all A's!"  Then how the students loved him One girl even baked a cake "Who cares that you didn't read them? Every class you teach, we'll take..."  ...  You better watch out, you better not cry You better not pout, I'm telling you why Law school grades are coming to town  They're making a curve, checking it twice One or two A's will have to suffice Law school grades are coming to town  They see you when you're sleeping, recall what class you missed And that's what the exam's about, 'cause the teacher can't resist  Oh, you better not brag, you better not guess Be sure they're not being mailed to your parents' address Law school grades are coming to town
