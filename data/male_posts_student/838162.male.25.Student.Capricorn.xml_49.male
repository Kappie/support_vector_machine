Although it was marred by the fact that she didn't call me even though she has been back for almost two weeks and that she forgot about my birthday.  *tsk tsk*  No matter, I forgive her :) I can't say that I've been very active in emailing, so my bad as well. We had a good conversation and I'm glad that we can communicate so well after so long. I've always enjoyed talking to her as she has this certain humor and joy in the way she speaks and we seem to be able to talk about anything. Everyone should have a friend like this. I'm looking forward to meeting up with her soon.   This reminds me of another, even older friend that also just came back, this time from Melbourne. I will have to remember to set a time to meet up with her too, if the boyfriend lets me that is. Especially difficult with V Day coming though.   Seems like Feb is the month to catch up with old friends, especially those returning from overseas. It's a pity that Feb is also the month that I have all my test and assignments due. Better make sure to plan my time well.  In hindsight I guess I should start emailing people more often. Even local friends. Usually my only online form of communication is this Blog and ICQ. But I can't assume that people will read this, especially with my irregular updating schedule. As for ICQ, not everyone would be online at the same time that I will be. With Email, they can't escape. Heh.    >   Just finished reading the latest  Star Wars: New Jedi Order  novel. It's a good continuation of the ongoing story line, but I feel that some of the characters seem, well out of character. Also missing was a few other favorite characters that were featured in previous books. Here is a very good quote from the book:   ”There's no right or wrong way to tread; the rules are made up as you go along and can change without warning...trust me when I say it makes being a jedi look easy.” - Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, on relationships.       >   Seen the latest  Matrix Reloaded trailer ? Man it Rocks! You can find both trailers at the  urlLink website . I can't wait for May, have to start watching the first movie over and over again to prepare for it. Sorta like what I did for the  Lord of the Rings  movies by reading the books again. This is going to be a big year with the ending of the Matrix movies in November, the ending of the above mentioned Star Wars series also in Nov and the last LOTR movie in December. It's going to be an interesting year ahead.  For now. Let me get back to work.
