Now, you may say to yourself, "Well, that's understandable enough, anybody could accidentally slice a finger or hand while trying to cut something." Well, Justin wasn't cutting anything.In fact, he was walking. To the bathroom. And he somehow managed to slip and slice the top of his left wrist. Smoothmuch. Anyway, he had to go in for three stitches, whereupon I was picked up from work (work being somewhat close to the hospitaling).  So, I arrive home to AP scores, which was quite the mixed bag. Of the four scores, two were roughly what I expected, one was below, and one was above. But I passed, so life can go on.  Five days to the TMBGing...  Everyone I know is on the livejournal. My lack of conformity really does make me feel inferior.
