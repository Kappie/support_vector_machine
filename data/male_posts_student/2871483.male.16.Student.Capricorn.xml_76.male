If i ever get out of here, Thought of giving it all away To a registered charity. All i need is a pint a day If i ever get out of here.  Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash as we fell into the sun, And the first one said to the second one there i hope you're having fun. Band on the run, band on the run. And the jailer man and sailor sam were searching every one  For the band on the run  Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh seeing no one else had come,  And a bell was ringing in the village square for the rabbits on the run. Band on the run, band on the run. And the jailer man and sailor sam, were searching every one  For the band on the run, band on the run, band on the run, band on the run  Well, the night was falling as the desert world began to settle down. In the town they're searching for us every where, but we never will be found. Band on the run, band on the run  And the county judge, who held a grudge Will search for evermore For the band on the run  -  Dear God, I'm gonna crack.  Summer school moves so slowly.  I cannot stand it.  It's so easy, it's basically an A and time to read Dracula for $110.  -  I failed my written today.  They ask really mean questions.  I mean, seriously, how many people know that a bicycle's headlight has to be seen 500 feet away?  Exactly.  -  We got an insurance quote.  Lower than I expected, but still insanely high.  So I'm taking this "Steer Clear" program to recieve a safe driver discount.  Easy and boring.  -  I am so bored around the house.  Seriously, I'm playing through all of my videogames again.  I even pulled out my N64!  Somebody call me or something!  -  I went to that Fleetwood Mac concert on Monday.  Rocked!  -  I'm noticing just about every song I create sounds like the others.  Dear God, I'm turning into the Offspring before I even have a band!  -  I noticed that summer school is the only way I get up in the morning.  Still don't want to go.  -  I fell asleep at seven last night.  SEVEN.  Actually, it's because I fell asleep at seven the night before that.  Only the former was PM and the latter was AM.  I fell asleep because I was studying for my written.  Go figure.  I actually slept twelve hours, though, which felt good.  -  That five speed's a killer, but I'm finally getting good at starting and stopping with that clutch.  I'm almost ready for the street.  -  It's great, when we were getting my quote at the insurance office, the woman asked for my birthday, and it actually took me a bit to remember.  -  Watch Arrested Developement.  It is the greatest show I've seen in a long time.  -  I've recieved calls from about four different area codes outside my own.  That's creepy.  Well, then again, I did post my number.  Who cares, I don't answer a number I don't recognize.  -  I miss my CD's ::cough cough jessie cough cough::.  -  My watch decided to lose another link, so now I'm watchless.  I feel so naked.  -  My shades broke too!  -  When a younger sibling goes out more than you do, there is something wrong.  -  Why the HELL doesn't Heritage have a freakin' pop machine?!  I NEED MY CAFFEINE IN THE MORNING! THEY CAN'T TAKE THAT FROM ME!  ANYTHING BUT THAT!  -  I wish I could have the house to myself once and awhile.  I wanna crank my music up without annoying anyone and having them retaliate with some crappy modern country song.  You know, ME time.  -  When you're bored, movie channels become your friend.  I've seen so many more movies by just turning it on.  Plus a few channels have long running sets of movies.  Stuff like that.  Good stuff.  -  My alarm's a bitch.  -   We had to write an essay about someone in summer school.  I chose my thesis about how SOMEONE (Not naming any names, because you know who you are) is EXTREMELY lazy, and how they passed up that concert for some more goddamn sleep time!  -  When I was taking my written test, the guy asked me if I was an identical twin.  I jokingly said yes, and he actually wrote it down.  I don't think he was very happy with me when he had to go through this long system of erasing shit.  -  I was playing Pandora Tomorrow online the other day.  I have so much fun grabbing the Mercs and whispering in their ears.  I'm much more entertaining than those stupid fucking Chapelle quoting guys ("I'm Rick James, bitch".  Fuckers.)  I say useful facts and such, like, for example.  ::jumps down and grabs Merc:: Me - "Did you know that a person can die from being shot in a limb due to the shock of bullet entry?" Him - "No, I didn't.  That's actually pretty intere- ::knocks out Merc::  ---  ::grabs him again later:: Me - "Did you know crashing your car at 25 miles per hour has the force of landing, face-first, on the ground after jumping off of a three story building?" Him - "....Actually, I think I've heard that somewhere bef- ::knocks him out::  ---  ::grabs him again:: Me - "Yo, did you kno- Him - "Just knock me out!" Me - "Hazaa!" ::knocks him out::  ---  Sometimes I just get bored and feel like listening.  ::grabs him again:: ::Drags him in a shadowed corner:: Me - "So, how have you been?" Him - "I'm a twenty-two year old who lives in his mother's basement." Me - "You lie, so, watch any good movi- ::gets shot by a taser:: Me - "Argh, you fucker!" Him - "You were getting on my nerves." Me - "Once I get feeling back in my legs, you're dea- ::gets shot in the head:: ::respawns:: Me - "Now what the hell was that for?!" Partner - "I've got him." Me - "Really.  Ask him how he's been.  He wouldn't tell me." Partner - "He say's he lives in his mother's basement." Me - "He lies, knock him out." Partner - "Dammit!  He hit me with a taser!" Me - "He's in for a big surprize, I'm right behind hi- FUCK!" Partner - "What?!" Me - "His partner just bashed me!"  Ÿeah, that's how it usual goes.  Those assholes, all I wanted was some friendly conversation!  -  Double the listening, eh?: Vera - Pink Floyd  Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn? Remember how she said, That we would meet again, Some sunny day.  Vera! Vera! What has become of you? Does anybody else in here feel the way I do?   Yeah, that one's a short one.  -  Nintendo's new portable looks very neato.  Probably the last system I'll end up buying.  -  Check out bash.org.  Not only is it a good way to kill time, but it's hella funny.  -  I need help.  Who is the last band they show on that new "iPod your BMW" commercial.  The one with three people, two guys and a girl, and the guy in the middle has a skeleton glove.  I MUST KNOW.  -  My room is so Goddamn hot!  The air conditioning is on, the windows and blinds are closed, the fan is on, but the room will not cool down!  -  I was in the kitchen, and I took a drink out of a can of Mountain Dew, and it somehow missed my mouth.  You know how it is.  My dad looked over and said you have a real drinking problem.  Heh.  -  WTF?  What the hell happened to my Björk?!  For some reason, my computer recorded Jason and I talking while we were ripping his Björk album.  And I pronounced "Tupac" like "Two Pack".  Yeah, that was a loooong time ago.  We sound like idiots talking.  -  I guess I should be doing my Am. Lit. homework.  SHOULD is the key word.  -  I'm considering getting another Game Pass from blockbuster.  I did it last summer and I once the year before that.  It used to be really cool, because you could rent two games at a time, but now they cut one of them off.  Still pretty good, except I can sometimes take my time with games.  Or maybe that Movie Pass, it's cheaper.  Then again, I don't want to drag my sorry ass up there all the time.  Besides that, Blockbuster hates me ever since I did what Seanbaby did and rented every game on the shelves and hung about the store doing odd things, like staring at posters for 15 minutes at a time.  Or returning the tree's worth of recepts the gave me.  Or going there close to closing time and then taking a long, long time.  They wouldn't bother me, because I looked absolutly mental when I did it.  Just stupid things.  -  I hate being at home when I'm bored because if I sneak out there's nowhere to go.  I live about three miles from everything except Jason's house.  It's better when I'm staying at my Grandparents' house, because then I can bother people, go to stores, eat and stuff.  Plus, it's getting harder to sneak out of my house, my mom keeps falling asleep on the couch.  I once used the emergancy fire ladder on my balcony to get out.  I get desperate when I'm bored.  -  Why doesn't some channel do something nice to insomniacs and put stuff other than infomercials on at night.  I'm up at three in the morning with nothing to watch except that damn toaster oven that you can "Set it and forget it!".  Even that Girl's Gone Wild infomercial got boring for me.    I'm losing it.  -  I drank a whole carton of soy milk.  That stuff is pretty damn good.  -  And to my friends that play Tactics Advance:  I GOT AN ASSASSIN!  AND THE NOSADA, BABY!  Wow, assassis haas two "ass"'s in it.  Wait, I'm sure thats not right.  -  Wow, hella long post.  I've finally run out of things to say.  I leave you with a thought.  Tired of stupid people?  I am.  We should just remove all of the safety and warning lables off of things and just let the problem work itself out.
