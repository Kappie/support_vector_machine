They fear that she's dying..but of course, Ali's rebellious self says she doesn't want to go and is going to run away if she has to go to the hospital. I think this is bullshit. She NEEDS to go to the hospital, what with her throwing up blood everyday. She doesn't want to go and is going to run away? What the hell? Doesn't she even care about what happens to her? Or what I'll do to myself if she ends up dying! I mean god...doesn't she take anyone else's feelings into account? I do not want her to die, yet she's rushing her death by staying up 109 hours straight, walking out on the road by herself in the middle of the night and then getting raped, not eating, and avoiding hospital visits. She won't even listen to me...she just keeps saying that she doesn't want to go to the hospital and she'll just run away...I'm powerless basically...she won't even listen to her lover. I just don't know what to do anymore...
