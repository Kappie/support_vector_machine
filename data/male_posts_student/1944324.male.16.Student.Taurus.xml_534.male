It'll be like that episode of The Simpsons with the Flaming Moe, and they change the bar style. We'll have a understated yet elegant monogram at the top of the page! Ha! Yeah, right. If we revamp with this crowd it's going to look like  urlLink Circus Circus . But it might eliminate the Italicization of Mass Destruction. Just an idea...  I'm extending an invitation to anyone at Compendium who is free on the 22nd of May (and who are not Erin or Thomas) and wants to go to a TWoPcon in Lafayette. It'll be fun!  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.
