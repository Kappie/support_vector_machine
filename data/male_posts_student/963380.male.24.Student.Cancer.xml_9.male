Did the whole waking up early thing too - porridge, orange juice (multiple glasses thereof) and watching CNN (Happy 'Merican-Thanksgiving.com). It's so early that, other than changing the batteries on my keyboard, I don't know what to do.  John came over last night, that was fun. We played animal crossing, which is always a blast. Earlier, I'd been playing Metroid Prime. Which is the best game - evar. Truly "teh shiznit" as it were. My parents got home from Floridia last night (might as well be a different continent, brought to you by the Land of Old(tm)). As is their way they brought me back countless goodies of goodness in nature. A two tone suede jacket has to be one of the coolest things - Dad picked himself up one, and mom, in her infinite generosity (and desire for me to have the best of everything on the planet - evar) mentioned it'd be cool to get me one too. Dad wants to be cool. He usually is. Hence, new jacket. Fits well too. New shirts and so on were also a sexy part of this deal.  Today I straighten my insurance and most of the deal on the vibe. I can no longer get the Shadow, due to much cock being gobbled at the dealership. That's okay though, the blue and the satellite have grown on me. I think I want the blue. I'm gonna wait to make a call till my dad gets to the dealership today though.  That is all for this transmission. I'm going to go get clean now.   P.S. to all those 'leet readers out there - I can spell ever and the. It's an internet thing. Trust me.
