I am down to two digits in my bank account....I called the telebanking hotline this morning to find out what my balance was and I was left with a wide open mouth....I really need to get paid very, very soon....otherwise I'm up the smelly creek without a paddle....something has to give very soon....one of my two jobs needs to come through!!  So much for the balling lifestyle!
