"But for the most part, Roosevelt did not have to deal with one problem Bush faces today. And that is that today's press works to put the worst possible face on the war. "  ....  "But they seldom seek the good news -- readily available in Iraqi and military weblogs and confirmed in polls of Iraqis -- that incomes, electricity, schools, water quality, medical care, religious freedom and security are improving in Iraq. Some reporters, as the Daily Telegraph's Toby Harnden reports from Iraq, deliberately avoid good news because they think it might help George W. Bush win re-election."  I can't emphasize enough the importance of the Web Logs from Iraq.  Almost uniformly, they say the same thing - Iraq is going well, life is improving, and our service people are excited and engaged at the task handed to them.    As Barone says - " The gains to be won by persevering in Iraq are great -- an example of decent government can change the Middle East. The losses to be suffered by not persevering are even greater: Vast gains by terrorists determined to attack everything we hold dear."
