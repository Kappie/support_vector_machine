I never distanced myself from my parents for the sole reason that they were parents, and I don't regret. I have lots of fun with my parents, my relatives, that kind of thing. I've gone to movies with my mom, and I don't mind because it was fun. I've never realy seen any reason to hate my parents unless they do something I really disagree with. This might be why most kids I know don't like their parents or hold them in some amount of contempt, becuase they're worse than my parents. Maybe, but I doubt it, because I've seen very few cases where the parents in question actually deserve all that emnity. I think it all has to do with the angst. God, angst.. A lot of people I know seem to think that being a teenager is just so gosh darn hard! But it's not. I don't think so, and look at me, I'm a fucking teenager. Let's address a few common concerns. 1. School- Okay, maybe not as big as a concern as I think, considering a lot of the grades I see. But it's not very hard either. Just quit dicking around all the time and pay attention to what you're doing. 2. Girls- I've seen people make and lose relationships all around me while my life has remained romantically devoid. Therefore, I have an objective viewpoint on this issue. It doesn't seem very hard either. I've had some issues with friends before, and they seem like the same kind of things you'd run into here. Basically, look for someone that you can tell you like. I've had some crushes, although I think I might have formed them just becuase it seemed to me like something I was supposed to do. I'm only really attracted to one girl, because if I don't hate them I'm pretty sure they hate me concerning the rest of the available population. Anyway, I think you should always be honest, brutally if need be, and find someone who can accept that. Beyond that, just don't be a dickwad and things generally seem to work out. 3. Jobs- Work is easy. You go in, tell someone you wanna do what they do here, maybe you'll get lucky and get a chance. In that case, it's hardly any different from school. Try real hard and find a job you like, so then work can be easy and fun. I thought there would be more reasons, but I already did parents, and that's all the things it seems like someone could stress about. Anyway, between all these things, some people get pretty fucked up. You ever seen a goth? Fucking angst. Even if it's not a goth, just any wanker who spews bullshit like "oh life is so stressful, I just feel like  I'm about to break. " That's the key phrase there at the end. Whenever you hear that, you should slap whatever head it came out of. It's only a problem because they let it, perhaps even because they let it be. Goths are still the worst though. Especially when they convince themselves that "holy shit! I must have been a demon in another life! If I act real fucked up and make the world less savory this time around, I could reclaim my rightful place and taste true power!" Those shitheads are the absolute worst of all. They think they're so special because they made up a story to explain their own idiocy. You may notice I talk like I consider MYSELF superior, and that's because I kind of do. You may say, "oh, he probably just doesn't understand! What right does he have to talk smack about people he doesn't even know?" That's a pretty good point, except I have constitutional rights, thank you very much. The thing is, I find myself nervous for feeling this way, but I think that I am slightly superior to the average person because I identify negative trends and rise above them. People thought I had some pretty nasty depression for a while. Thie was because I was caught slitting my wrists with scissors in 6th grade. I did this because I was curious to see if they would spray everywhere. Everyone around me decided I must be depressed, and I let myself think it, and went to therapy for a while. Now this therapy was expensive, I realized. I also realized that the pills and little talks weren't doing a whole lot. Nothing, in fact. Except give me horrible stomachaches. The pills did that. So, I stepped back and took a look, because, hey, if I was depressed, pills and therapy should be making me feel different, right? They did nothing, so I figured nothing was wrong, and you know what? I was probably right. Because I am a happy fellow. I smile every day. The suggestion was never put forth again that I was depressed because of a fucked up brain. To this day, I belive that the reason I acted dumb in the first place was because someone else stamped the idea into my malleble brain that I must be sad for no reason. Think about that.
