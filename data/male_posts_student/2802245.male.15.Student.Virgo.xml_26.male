The traffic is the next thing....  having stepped off a plane with less than no sleep in 24 hours I was confronted by a very seedy looking woman taxi driver in a leather jacket looking like she was about to offer me drugs... Crack anyone?  now to full rant mode... I was nearly been run over more times in a span of a week than I have been in 15 years... and here you can get run over by all kinda of traffic in the average city... taxis... vans... the common lorry and the occasional 16 wheeler... oh yeah and bicycles and the often seen bike with a cart stuck to the back and three wheels in total....  to negotiate the average road.... well.... the average road is about 3 lanes either side with a lane for bikes and other bipedal vehicles and people.... did I mention a lot of people?  anyways... understandably the cross road is very large... understand that pedestrian lights are rare... the chances of finding one when you need it is like ... uh... something very rare happening...  the best one can do is find the interval between one light and the next and run... hoping the cars perpendicular to the road you are crossing do not decide to turn....  drivers are also very fond of their horns... I mean very.... they can't get enough of it... bus drivers and some taxi drivers have it worst... its like a disease... thou must  spread the good word by a deafening blast of the horn... if the car/bike/lorry/person/monkeyonashetlandpony doesn't move.... repeat... perseverance always pays off....  I have already had complaints about this post being the equal to the length of war and peace... but I promise.... no russians...  but I regress... tis the end of post 1/10... be happy that pinky decided to grant me post position in the blog :)... He may yet regret it  p.s... no proof reading  [Edit: Did the spell checking etc... God I feel like I'm a forum moderator or something :/ - Jim]
