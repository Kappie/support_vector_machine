    
       I'm done with Spring Quarter, and with it, my sort-of first year of college. I'm hungry.  I totally flunked my math final, but it's okay. I calculated ahead of time that I couldn't get an A in the class, and to get a C in the class I would have had to get less than 80% on the final. I got 83%. I thanked the heavens and took them out for dinner.  Really really hoping I did super good on Japanese final. *crosses many people's fingers*  So tonight I was abducted and taken to my sister's CMT show. What could have been a gross, boring and painful experience, was quickly made better by my examination of the program. I quickly spotted a "Vallone" in the show, and then another one on the next page. Quickly scanning the audience, I immediately found Tony seven rows in front of me. I only could have recognized him because of his brown striped shirt. It was funny.  It's Summer. Where is all the fun?
