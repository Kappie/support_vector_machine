Maybe it's the I LOVE THE 80s STRIKES BACK 1982 on right now, maybe it's the eight pages of screenplay I've written since Sunday, maybe it was the hour I spent at Gregory Gym tonight.    Well, it stems from the workout at Gregory...I always feel better after some stairmaster, some weights, and the longing for healthy food and water.  But the interest was moreso in campus than the gym per se.    I'd often find myself in the library at Centenary come midnight, somewhat because I'm a night owl, partly because I had friends who worked the night shift, but mostly because by that time, the campus was dead, and all that was left was the library.  My junior year was a bit different, but it revolved around Matthew Philbrook, Brian Thomas, and myself in the SUB playing Ms. Pac-Man or on Jones-Rice throwing the disc.  Regardless, if I wasn't around come midnight, nothing was going to happen...and even if I was there it was a small chance that I could get people to do anything with me.    And this was how I considered college to be for some odd reason...life would go on around campus (Joe's, Phillin Station, TKE House...all places I frequented), but the college was shut rather early.  Students just weren't as exciting as they had been portrayed in the movies.   Katie Carnahan hated this, and halfway through her freshman year decided she was going to transfer, even though she had me right there (I did get an extra semester out of her, which might not have been the best thing, but was still fun).  She wanted to tour Southwestern in Georgetown, and to do that she'd visit her friend Amy Cass at UT over our Spring Break...April 14, 1999.  I can remember it partially because it was the opening weekend of THE MATRIX, but mainly because when Katie and I turned off I-35 to MLK, went past Trinity and San Jacinto, mad the turn onto Whitis, and parked at Jester, my idea of college changed.    This was my first trip to Austin, and it meant nothing to me.  Up until Temple, where Katie got kind of rowdy in her dad's truck and decided to distract me as best she could (and she did a good job of it), I thought the most exciting part of the trip was going to be when I met her father, who I didn't meet, because he wanted to yell at her about me and the truck to Austin.  But that changed as Katie and I parked in the overflowing parking lot that was close to the size of Centenary (not so much), and, at 2:00 am, found about twenty guys playing field hockey on a FIELD HOCKEY FIELD outside of Jester.  It wasn't the makeshift shit course or something that we were always forced to use at Centenary...it was an honest Field Hockey field, part of a dormatory.    And we spent the weekend at UT, and it was pretty glorious, and I really thought UT was more like Disneyland than it was a college...you had all of Guadalupe and its consumerism greatness, four gyms, all sorts of shit just happening on campus...so sensory I was shocked anyone could get work done.    And now I'm a student here...I've been one almost two years.  But this could be the first night I've been here that I've been back at that Jester corner after midnight, and seen just all the shit still going down on campus...loud music playing, people throwing balls or discs or what have you, study groups starting, pizzas coming, dates going home, dates just getting started, conversations gaining steam, poker games letting out...the place was alive.  And it felt good, just to see it, to be reminded of how much energy there can be in a place.    My house shuts down after 10...Tripper's usually at Maggie's, and Evan's an old man.  Brian's moving across the street come Sunday, and Corey Pavletich will be here then too, so things should pick up...and I'm excited.  Because I'm tired of the day shutting down so early.  I don't wake up before 9, and I don't see a need to.  I want to be a part of it again...shit, I know I'm 24, and I'm six years invested in higher education.  But there's no reason I have to act like an old man.
