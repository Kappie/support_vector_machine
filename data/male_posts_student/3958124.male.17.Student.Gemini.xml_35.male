What a lame thing, huh? Well, things were going great. I learned that Nathanial got his server running, and that Travis was out pimpin' the 'hood. Things were going awesome, and I was almost done checking out the pro's. Then, I got to this girl's pro and I had to stop. I can't tell you who, because it's really stupid. Here is somthing that you should never put in your profile; "Me and my bf Mikey 4 eva!" What is wrong with you? Do you really need to let Mikey know that you and him are an item? How romantic do you really think it is? At least it's not a tatoo - you can change Mikey to Steevie next week when Mikey doesn't "fulfill all of your needs" anymore. Damn, that pisses me off.   Less sooner, this is Eric Datsmard reporting from Arlington High Heaven. Tom, back to you.
