She was waiting for everyone to settle down, yet everyone knew it was a different day, as she was not her usual self.  Then the surprise came. She said she didnt want to have lesson today. Instead, she wanted to talk about Life.   Whyfore do we live?    That was the question posed to us. Then she started asking ppl, What is the purpose in life.   Funny answers popped out, such as To have sex. To ensure the continuation of our species.  But i knew what i would say, my purpose in life is to find out wat my purpose in life is.  Miss Foo's purpose in life was to find the meaning in life. Confusing?   Anyway, this simple pep talk spooked us all out. Her usual scoldings were all redundant. This was the real surprise. A sudden talk on Life. A sympton of suicidal, as taught by a lecture the school had organised.   Now i wonder..... where is she.... Earth or Heaven.
