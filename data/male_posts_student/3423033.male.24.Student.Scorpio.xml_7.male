I want to get good on a real piano again, and that's the best I'm gonna get.   I went to Jeff's to take pictures of the instruments. Thank god for that kid. He knows exactly what he is doing. Now I got some sweet looking pictures for the sale.  I kicked ass on my systems analysis midterm today, and the grader also let us know that our work was the best on the class diagrams and sequence diagrams. Knowing my greatness I was not surprised by this.   I'm worn out. Night.
