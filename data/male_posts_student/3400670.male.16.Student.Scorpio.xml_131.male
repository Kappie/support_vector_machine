Well first of all, the test commenced in an environment in which Zenson mistakenly said "This test consists of ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS AND SIX SHORT ANSWERS IN 55 MINUTES!"  And that just sent the room to completely dead silent with everyone stopped breathing!!!!!!!!!!!  And then the multiple choice section:  Soooooooooooooo HARD............SOOOOOOOO MUCH HARDER THAN ALL AND EVERY SINGLE PRACTICE MULTIPLE CHOICE TEST WE"VE EVER TAKEN!!!!!!!! Frank, Ryan, Tristan and many others would certainly agree with me. WHAT THE HECK?????????? About 80% of the questions were a wobble between two answers..........GOOD GOD I DID ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously, SO SMALL PORTIONS OF THE QUESTIONS HAD A DEFINITIVE ANSWER!!!!!!!!!!!! NO MATTER HOW MUCH HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE YOU KNEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 80% of the questions to anyone is just completely debatable.  Anyways, that's my extreme rant of the day.........I'd really like to hear others' opinions and afterthoughts about today's test. And oh yeah, have fun everybody the next week, I'll see you guys on May 17th.
