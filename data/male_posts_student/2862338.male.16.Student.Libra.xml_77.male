I guess the most important piece of information i can give right now is that i got my DCA (denied Credit due to Absents) overturned....want a story? you've come to the right place.... :o )   back during third quarter, i finally begin to drive.  Problem is,  with great power comes great responsibility , (yeah, stop laughing, i know where thats from) which basically means, i woke up late like EVERY day.  Now, this wasn't a big deal, Jesse was late more than a slut, so i figured it wasn't gonna really be a problem.  Acouple of weeks later, My AP English (thats the class I DCA'd due to tardies...it's 1st period) teacher informs me that i DCA'd that quarter.  So i was like " WTF??!?!? ", but anyway, i go down to the attendance office, and turns out all those absence's, which i got notes for, counted towards DCA...those smart bastards. anyway, my mom (thank GOD for her) went in and cleared them ALL up...one problem, the DCA still stands until i get it overturned, IF THAT.  So fast foward to yesterday, i try and get my papers in order and shit, and Mr. Watson tells me that he's gonna try and stick me in today for an appointment....i end up waking up REALLY early (whats new...) and i get there late...cause i could....(muahahahh) but ya, they're were people there waitng. but apparently i was the first of the bunch, even though i was the last to get there (it rocked hard man..), but ya, i go into the main office, and sit down at this table that kinda looked like a stone tablets the Inca's would use to sacrafice Virgins or something (no WONDER i was there!!!!) anyway, i "state my case", or as i like to call it, "lower my pride meter" and give some bogus ass excuse about my car breaking down...now, i know my car is kinda bad, or atleast the engine is VERY high milage, BUT, the was i made it sounds was HORRIBLE!! the greatest part of it all....she BOUGHT IT!!! i mean, she gave me a diet speech about how that wouldn't work in the real world and shit, and i was like "yup, yup, yup" and she let me go...was what was awsome is, she ask if i got my gown and the sqaure thing already (forgot what it's called) and i was like "o, i'm no a snior"...we walk out (mr. watson, my guidance counceler, and me) and they were telling me how amazingly lucky i was cause she usually dosn't overturn shit like that for underclassmen...and i was just ALL smilez...now there are sveral theories i came up with as to the success of my overturn:  1. Because she thought i was a senior, she let me slide  2. She felt real bad cause i was the first one, and it was so early  3. she's acutally a nice person  4. She thought i had alot of balls to give her such a bogus ass excuse  5. she was inpressed with the letter  6. She thought i was uber hawt (needed a filler!)   so there ya have it, that was my day in the morning....i spent the rest here, listening to music and shit, the usual.  I was looking at all the complete CD's i have ripped on my Computer, and like, Now 2 was there, and there's that song "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen) (Edit)" by Baz Luhrmann.....omg, let me say, that song is awsome...... AWSOME!!!! ...i remmeber loving this back when i first got the cd, but i re-discovered it....and now, i wanna base my life after this guy...           ya, ummmm, what else.....o yeah, i'm going to Florida on Saturday....i'm very excited, cause everytime i go to FLorida, i'm older, and wiser, and the whole time becomes better...ya.  But i still got today and tomarrow.  Today i wanna go out, and have a "guys night out" for jorge.  Don't know why? to bad..cause i ain't saying it. But i think he needs one, and i think we juss all gotta chill. I think it just hit everyone that this like the last summer together for alot of people, so gotta make it count. I might not make it though, cause i MIGHT have to go to the mall, and buy last minute shit for florida, but if dosn't, i hope the guys take him out anyway, i think he needs it.    Tomarrow is promising to be a HELL of a day...But i'm not putting to much stock in it....In the afternoon, i got the re-taping of  Martosis  and that night, A BUNCH of us are suppose to go to the movies...here's the gang so far:  Me (nooo!?!?), jones, rob, jorge, mike, scott, jenn, Caroline, farah, lilia, ummmmm Possibly Sabby, and whoever he brings  so yeah, good sized group...were suppose to go see  urlLink Dodgeball: A true Underdog Story , so hopefully it'll be worth it.  And i know waht your thinking...one phrase can say it all.....OoOooooooOOoOOO!!!! lol, ya, i know i like Lilia, it's no secret, i'm not embarassed or anything, but whats funny is, i found this thing about Libras (thats what i am), and it describe ON THE DOT the problem i have with trying to go out with someone....i'll put the whole thing in,  urlLink Here's  the Link to it.    When it comes right down to taking action, however your indecisiveness often takes over. You start to weigh the pros and cons and if you have any doubts at all you will continue to play with your victims' desires. You don't really like to hurt anyone intentionally which does end up putting you at the mercy of your lover.    that shit hit me like a ton of bricks...cause it's true, thats what happens, lol, like, i was like HOLY SHIT...THAT IS SOOO TRUE.  But, now that i realized that, i'm gonna work to stop that.  I  actually  like her, so i definitly want to try and be with her....let's see how things go on friday, not juss for us, for another 2 also... :oD (OOooOOOOOOOoOOoOOoOOOOOOoOoOoOOooooOOOoooOOooooOOOOOoO!)   oooooooooooo, i forgot, if ANYBODY has either the Franz Ferdinand, Modest Mouse, New beastie Boys, or d12 world, can u PLEASEEEEEEEE burn me a copy!?! or Maybe just let me borrow the CD's so i can rip em??! Thanx, k! LOVE YA!!!   Ok, well, i might update later, TOODLES!!  Song You Should listen to RIGHT NOW: The Cars - You Might Think (oOooOOooOOooOO!!!!!...i know thats what your gonna say)  P.S.:
