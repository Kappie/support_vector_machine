I'll add this post to the Admin Notices.  By the way, if this 'random' thing that your posting is comic material, you can e-mail it to me or Ryan, just find out e-mails, or use the 'Contact' button below the side-bar, however from now on, regardless of how well-thought out the thing that your poating mite be, I will erase it without even considering it.  (mail spammers will be banned, and have their IP banned as well)  I am not joking around about these rules at all so dont even think about testing me.
