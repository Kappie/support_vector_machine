Anthony will maintain his livejournal (friends only) blog and Matt his Trash Talk for private purposes, but we will use Toyah to discuss politics, current events, and whatever else we're moved to share.   My old posts will remain on the blog, unless I can find something else to do with them.  We're in consultation with J-Rock, Higgin-booty, and big-D, also former highlanders, about joining as well.  Good things to come...   urlLink
