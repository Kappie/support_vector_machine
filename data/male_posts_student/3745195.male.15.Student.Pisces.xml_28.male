I had a lot of fun and played the best I've ever played before [basketball] I finished "The Notebook" and I have to say that I didn't think a person could become so attached to fictional characters. The critics said that the last chapter would make you cry and I didn't believe it because I've never cried over a book, but I did cry. It was sad and amazing at the same time. I would tell you all about it, but most of you have already seen the movie [*sad face* I haven't seen the movie] but it was an excellent book and I would recomend it to anyone who believes in true love. Then I started "The Wedding". Again a great book [even though I'm only on page 30] but my bag got stolen while I was in Boise [my cell phone charger/both those books i mentioned/a lot of cd's/house key/my snacks for the bus ride] So that sucked, but I'll get over it. I'm nervous about calling anisia though. I haven't been this nervous about something in the longest time. Well I'm going to go eat something cause I haven't in like 5 hours.   I love you anisia
