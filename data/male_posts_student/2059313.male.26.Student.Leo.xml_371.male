So instead, I watched the 14 hour marathon of MXC on Spike TV.  A couple of the "pranks" I thought about were:  - calling someone and telling them their refrigerator was running, then hang up.  - call someone and tell them I was from the clinic and that their test came back positive... then later when they were getting worried, double check what their name was - when I found out - I would apologize and tell them to have a nice day.  - call someone I know - have a normal conversation with them (while sitting in my car).  Then at one point I would yell out something like, "Oh My God", or "Oh Shit"... fumble the phone around a second and then hang up like I was in an accident.  There were others, but I'm not up to writing them down right now, and plus, they really just got meaner from there.
