Even falling off my chair in the general direction of my bed is going to be an accomplishment... i couldn't make it upstairs to use the jacuzzi which really probably would have helped me...  Still, despite all the crap i'm going through, it feels good to be back. I missed football.  Oh well, i should just get to bed, if i sleep now, that'll be nine solid hours...  Tomorrow is gonna be a tad harder then today, since well... i'm gonna wake up and not be able to move.  That should be fun.
