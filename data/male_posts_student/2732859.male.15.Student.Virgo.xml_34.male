I personally can't wait for it to begin so that John Kerry and John Edwards can introduce themselves to the country. I just hope that the GOP doesn't pull something out next week to take attention away from the convention. Today there were reports about a possible terrorist threat to news vans and trucks at the convention next week by a domestic terror group. Lets just hope that nothing happens and the convention goes smoothly and John Kerry becomes the 44th president of the United States of America on January 20, 2005.
