Maybe its because they where hurt they where hurt themselves or that they didn't get some thing they wanted that they wanted from someone else. That in doing so that it will some how make the pain go away. That in destroying some one else they would lift themselves above the pain that was inflicted on them. But the truly indistinct thing in every case is that, it wont go away. You cant hurt someone else and expect yourself to feel better about being hurt. The truly sad thing is that everybody that's experienced it does it. And no one trys to stop the cycle that they go through. Even people who are the sweetest, nicest, kindest people will do it and they don't even know that they're doing it. THE PAIN DOESN'T GO AWAY, IT WILL ALWAYS BE THERE, UNLESS YOU FIND SOMEONE TO MAKE IT GO AWAY. In that I mean that, to get rid of the pain you need someone that you treasure higher, or come to like more. Love from another is the only thing that will make it go away, that's why I think its a bad idea to not date if you've been hurt. Because life will go on with out that person. You just have to give it a chance. People will hurt you but they will love and care for you.        Yeah but we were supposed to leave for China on Thursday(actually 2:30 flight out on Friday morning), but that day my dad got a kidney stone. When he went to the hospital they found that he had a dozen or so more. So he's having them blasted on Monday, we're going to Vancouver hospital for that. I finally got my Ipod... IM SO HAPPY. Its so cool and a really cool surprise, the guy sent the wrong one. I ordered a 15gb Ipod and he sent a 20gb, which has way more options. So yeah just hangin... As always I would appreciate feed back. Always like to know what you guys think, so if you guys have some differing thoughts throw some my way. Ok bye guys.... and girls.
