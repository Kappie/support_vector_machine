It's not like you would though.   Nate tossed out the idea of hosting my blog for me, and thus rescueing me from my little land of blog*spot. If so, it may mean that I can switch to Movable Type, maybe. Nate hasn't promised anything yet, and I don't want to give Lindsey any ideas, but he WILL host my blog one way or another, or else.  Stay tuned for my new URL if Nate does decide to be so kind. It should be something like natedillon.com backslash something or other.
