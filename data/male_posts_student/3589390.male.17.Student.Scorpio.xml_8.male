Nothing extremely interesting happened today, had a baseball game but we didn't have enough people, so we recruited one of my teammate's sister to play..oh boy. I'll give it to her, she had some fortitude coming out to play with us and she wasn't half bad. I had to creep into right field a lot to help her out, thus leaving a huge gap where I normally play so, that presented a huge problem. Anyways, they killed us...I went 1-1 with a single into left field..I only got up twice, but the first time the umpire said the ball hit me so..I didn't argue with him. :P  Hm..well I'm tired. I may watch one of my new DVD's tonight, possibly American History X or Memento..both amazing films..okay time to go. I know, this was a complete waste of your time so...too bad, it's all your fault for thinking it'd be interesting. :)
