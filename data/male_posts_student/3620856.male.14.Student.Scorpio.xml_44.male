Even though it may be in our hearts and minds, but I am sure God exist somewhere... There's always God... But, why do people don't believe that God exist? Why do they question his existance? Why do they make wild assumptions of how they were created? Is this what we should do? We doubt the one who created us... Is that what we are meant to be? We are made to destroy what God has created. That is what I see in this world today. But God forgives... Right?    We destroy as we are afraid. That's human nature. When we are afraid of something, we either join it or destroy it. We destroy ourselves, does that mean we are afraid of ourselves? We hate ourselves, don't we? We just don't want to admit it... Some of us think of ourselves as greater than others, but they are just escaping from reality. They claim that they are either very handsome or very strong, but, in fact, they will be very disappointed in themselves when they find out the real truth. We are just creatures that don't want people to think of us as inferior. Therefore, pride is something all of us have. It's just like smoking... It's addictive, and fun. But, it's very harmful... It evens harms us without us knowing... We have to learn to be humble. Pride is a disease that all humans have... Only God has the cure...      You're the disease, I'm the cure
