In the end, it was England 4, Croatia 2. Englands goals came from Paul Scholes ((who hadn't scored for England in 3 years, thats 30 matches) after a great bit of teamwork and a great header across from Rooney), Wayne Rooney himself got 2, then Frank Lampard finished things off with a great run past the Croatian defence and a decent shot into the corner.  So...BRING IT ON PORTUGAL!!!  Oh, and my last exam is tomorrow. Bleh.
