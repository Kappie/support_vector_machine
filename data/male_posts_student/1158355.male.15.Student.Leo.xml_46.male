It was time for Paul's bday party and Jared went to his house and Paul wasn't home so Jared came over my house and we told Matt to come and that we were putting up picket signs in front of Paul's house. Mine said "We Want Paul!"... Jared's said "No Paul, Party At Tom's! --->" with the arrow facing my house, and I made Matt's saying "We Want Food... And A Party!" On our way to Paul's we saw Mrs. Stoltz drive towards Ricky's house which told us she would be back in about 10 seconds with Paul, Ricky and the Easter Bunny Cake. Second time Mrs. Stoltz passes by, Jared chases her and then she turns around and chases Jared to Paul's. Matt arrived first and Matt comes out of his car telling us him mom thought we were assholes. It's true though. Then Paul finally arrived with Ricky. Mrs. Stoltz loved the picket signs so much she planted them in her garden along with her OWN picket sign... "It's A Boy!!!"... ya know, the thing from when Paul was born. Then I said, "There's a new device in your garden everyday," pointing out the awesome alien looking device sprouting out of the garden. Ok so everyone was there now, Jared S, Matt K, me, Nolan P, Ricky H, Shaun K, John R, Paul, Gabe W, Erin S, Emily G, Heather S, and Shapiro finally arrived... some time. We all played some basketball until everyone decided to stick me to a tree, get bungy cords and rap me to the tree and have those little monkies next door to Paul to beat the shit out of me. Seriously I have like 20 cuts and bruises now thanks to Paul and those little shits. Seriously, next time I see them, I will slice their heads off with my Papa's chainsaw. haha ok maybe not but I'll probably tie them to trees and start poking them with sticks. After torture, we played football. Erin took me down after me thinking she wouldn't tackle me so I ran right into her. Yea, I got stuffed by a girl, I admit it, she took me down hard also, my ass bone is broken. I think my team won, I made 2 touchdowns or 1, I'm not sure if the second one with Erin was one because we stopped after I was dead. It was still a fun game. Then we played soccer, something I can not do. I just sat around waiting for the ball to come to me and when it finally did I kicked it into the post and it flew back through Ricky's legs and came to me where I kicked it again and it went all the way out of bounds. For me, that was something to be proud of, I don't think I've ever scored an actual gole before. If I did, I'd probably get an orgasm. After the huge soccer game, we played more soccer (WORLD CUP) and everyone had fun playing soccer except for me... I had fun playing on the swingset. I kept going on the top of the monkey bars and singing Japanese mantras and saying Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and doing that thing where your right foot steps ahead but you step on your toes, I was so Japanese at that moment, I felt so awesome. Yea, it was all fun until Shapiro broke the dam wood swingset, then it was hilarious. He was on the swing and all the sudden... CRACK! BOOM! He took a hard fall onto the ground on his ass. Ouch! Then, we played some capture the flag which wasn't so great concidering I fell right into the swan in the garden. My pancreas is killing me now. The swan is alright and that's all that matters. After CTF, we ate some pizza... and some Matza pizza. We played more World Cup and then I sat behind the gole and had everyone take a huge shot at my ass. Unfortunetly, Ricky smashed my head. Then we went inside, had the Easter Bunny cake and then I went home to my mailbox to get Paul's present where I had hid it. It was a huge bag of pennies with a nice card of two black kids on the front, of course it was me and Paul. NO, don't think I'm that cheap, I gave him a 20 also. But I sware, Shaun is a true jew, he smelt the pennies before the bag was opened and of course all the jewish people at the party went crazy and started ripping the bag to find the pennies scattered all over the room. Paul opened all the rest of the presents and then me and Nolan played volleyball with pennies and balloons. It works! Finally, we played manhunt which was a shit load of fun. I ran and ran and ran from everyone and nobody could catch me! I had to hop fences, dive under bushes, hide in pots, hide behind cars, crawl 100 feet, create distractions, run around the neighborhood and direct my teammates to certain places. It was the greatest time ever. I can't explain everything in detail, if you want to hear it, ask me sometime. Finally we played DARE, not truth, truth is retarded. The first dare was for Ricky to run around the house with boxers, he did it. Then I humped the Petro truck, I did it. Then Erin had to take off her shirt and hug Paul, she did it... too bad it was dark out. Then Matt had to make out with Emily, HOLY SHIT MATT MADE OUT!!! GO MATT GO MATT GO MATT! Seriously, Matt deserves an applause for that. I mean, come on, it's Matt!!! GO MATT GO MATT! GO GO GO MATT! Then everyone left, I went sleepy, the end. Now finally to today Joe T came over, and I went to the movies with Paul, Ricky and Erin and a 10th grader, Tori. We saw Malibu's Most Wanted... funny movie.
