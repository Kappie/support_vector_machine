I mean, I could spit out something like "Top Ten Signs Your Memo Is Too Long" (#4: The index has an index) or "Top Ten Excuses for Not Finishing Your Assignment On Time" (#7: Lunch was 142 hours long), but I'd just be going through the motions.  I could make a joke about political figure "Deep Throat" dying today ("No, no, not Monica Lewinsky") but that would be cheap.  I could link you to some interesting stuff on other blogs (like  urlLink here  or  urlLink here ), but that's always a last-resort kind of tactic.  I could talk about the really flexible new toothbrush I bought and how it's totally rocking my oral hygiene world, but there's only so much I can say about a toothbrush.  I could talk about  urlLink the book I started reading on the way home tonight  and how I think it's really interesting so far, but I'm only on page 31, so I can't really be sure it'll hold up for the whole book.  But I've got nothing.  So I'll just give you this mess of a post and hope it's enough.
