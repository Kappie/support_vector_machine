I even have to ask Father to bring me there! Of course, I also ferried CQ. Gloria was in school le. Hmm.  The first activity of the camp is practising the songs. We were practising until 4+. Wow! Gerald Ng is a good sectional leader! He really makes sure you know your work..even at particular notes. Okay, as I was saying before we got distracted, the lights were tripped and we decided to go out to play games.  YaY! Group D, mah group, won most of the games!! YAY!! Gerald Law was quick in the Dog  Biscuits game. HaHa! His number keep getting called.   Soon, it was time to bath. Wah lao...the bathing/changing room was totally pitch black, save for the remaining sunlight filtering in! I quickly bathed la(wah!!! cold cold cold water!) and waited for CQ.   Yeah..after that we went for dinner. Dinner was quite disgusting. Eeee. Okay..after that, we went to practise our song for TalentTime. O.O!   After that, we had Treasure Hunt. HaHa! It was over and done with in 30+ minutes. HaHa! We were really rushing like mad! We still lost in the end though. Sigh!   Well, we gathered in the canteen to tell ghosts stories. Ayioh..so scary one. That David ar! We know he was going to scare us by BOOing or something...but we still got scared. Heh Heh. Gullible fools. Soon, Groups A and C went for Night Walk. O.O! B and D stayed and played games to pass the time.  Right. It was time to tour the school. For convienence sake, I shall not post all the stories la. I just bascically looked down at the floor throughout the tour. Yeah.   After the tour, we went to eat supper. I ate Tom Yam noodles and milo! HaHa! We went back to MPR3..after we mass went to the toilet.   Today   Yes! Today! HaHa! Wah lao..we all stayed up real late to discuss/practise songs. Miss Toh and Miss Lim slept with us. Anyhoo...groups started to sleep la. Our group were rehearsing with Dorothy, cause she joined our group for TalentTime. We sang and sang..till 2.30.  We all slept on the sleeping bag provided by CQ! How nice! The five of us were sleeping in a star formation (everyone was saying it looked so nice!). It wasn't a nice sleep. I woke up constantly throughout the sleep. Once Gloria was outside..I accompanied her until she went over to talk to a group of people. I then went back to sleep. I kept waking throughout. I finally got woken up by Dorothy's watch alarm at 6.45. Wah lao..feel so groggy and tired.   We did morning PT. So tiring! After that, we went for breakfast, where I stupidly poured hot water into the lemon tea...and Dorothy and CQ poured cold water in theirs. Right. After that was more games..and our group cut open the watermelon to eat! How sweet!   Okay..after that was volleyball game. We lost utterly. HaHaHa! Oh well. During on the matches, Dorothy spilt her lips. Oh god...that was terribly painful. She was crying and crying..oh god. That must hurt a lot!   Okay..after the games..we went to eat lunch. Hmm...this time's food was better. Yeah. After that, we practised our song!! Dionne came over and helped. HaHa! Right...  Okay. The TalentTime for us was a big flop. We did lousily. Terribly lousily. Dun wanna talk about it. Rehearsals were much better. Yep.   After TalentTime was the prize presentation. Wee! Group D got 2nd group placing overall! YaY!!   AFter that, we went back. So tiring!! I went back, bathed, came online and chatted with JiaHao..then went to eat dinner. Watched TV, came online and chatted with a few of me friends. Here I am blogging. I am damn tired. I fell asleep while watching Sun Wu Kong just now. Sigh. Didn't get to see Sandy's ordeal.   Yeah. I gotta get going. Need my precious sleep!!! On the bed!!! See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
