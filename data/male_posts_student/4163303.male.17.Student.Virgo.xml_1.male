I didn't know this board was secret, if I did I wouldn't have posted the link on my website.  Now that I know, I WILL take it off.  I don't think I'm the most important person in the world, generally I try to make my friends happy.  I'm really confused why everyone thinks I'm a jerk.  I don't try to make people mad.  I only want to have friends.  What I wrote on my web journal was just what my thoughts were at that moment and at that moment I was just venting, without naming you in particular.  I never called you a B****, I just felt that you were acting like one at that moment.  I didn't mean to ever annoy anyone or make them mad.  If I did, I am truely sorry.  The reason why I use my computer so much, maybe some of you know and some of you don't, is because I am in a wheelchair and I can't do very many things.  Chatting is one thing i CAN do and I enjoy very much.  Most of you can do many other things, but the options for me are very, very limited.  If none of you ever want to talk to me again, I understand and it is okay. Thank you so much for chatting with me for so long and I'm sorry if I upset anyone.
