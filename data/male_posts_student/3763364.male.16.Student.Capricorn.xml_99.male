My hatred was ungrounded. Then again, no hatred is ever justified.  All my life I had been preaching about how hatred will destroy everything, and then I go and become a living example of it. I've decided to have a zero-tolerance policy on hatred. No more hatred. Not towards anybody. Well, except Bush. I hate Bush. It's just an awful tasting beer. *snickers*    I still don't forgive me. I don't see how anybody else can.
