The person I  studied was a quite insane and depressed character who spent most of  her time staring at her teapot.  Searching  I am always searching Looking for that underlying meaning What is it for which I search? Searching for an answer, a purpose, for someone to tell me what to do? Questions, questions, always questions. And so here I sit, removed from this world, separated from all the  material world, A mindless bliss. The isolation is like millions of  ants, consuming me in my place,  carrying me away to the void of spirits. I used to search for love, I found it, and then it bit me Quick Fast Sharp My body still scars, that night the voices returned In my head they moan, ‘Go, leave, die!’ They will never go, I know it I want to scratch them out of my head, but I know I can not I have a haven, I place I can go The shining symbol of what was My teapot still sits, high on the shelf It silences the voice For I must not leave for fear of him coming back, the voice inside me will not go For only at death will we part  Paul Yarnall
