Come one guys and girls, if you are so bugged by it then go get off the computer and get a date, its your fault you are alone. i know what you are saying, its easy for you because you have someone. in all reality, i dont. i know how it is to go through this day alone, it should bother you. i just get pissed by the fact that all these people wont get off their asses to go mingle with other singles.  im bored, im going to get another Sunshine Smoothie.
