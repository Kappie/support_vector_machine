A Saucerful Of Secrets (Live)  This album was released as a two record set, one studio album and the other a live album. The first disc starts out with four songs from Rick Wright with weird sounds and other music and no lyrics. The 5th and 6th songs, the only songs that are not parts, are from Roger Waters. The 5th song has guitar playing lyrics for the first of the album, but the most amazing is his 2nd song (the 6th from the total) has animal sounds and weird pict sounds. The 7th, 8th,  9th songs are from guitar great, David Gilmour. Now his songs have great guitar playing (as usual, because he is the greates around) and great bass playing and other weird sounds, and great lyrics. The last songs on the first record (10th, 11th,  12th) are from Nick Mason with flutes, drums, and other weird sounds, but no lyrics. The only songs that have lyrics are Granchester Meadows, from Roger Waters,  The Narrow Way: Part 3, from David Gilmour. The Second side has four of there greates tunes fromthat time. The cool thing is that they played them much harder from the studio album and differentlly. The was the first album from Pink Floyd without there former frontman Syd Barret, who was forced to leave from many doses of LSD (which was legal back then). The LSD made Syd flip-out  he was never focused half the time. -Richard Dasher
