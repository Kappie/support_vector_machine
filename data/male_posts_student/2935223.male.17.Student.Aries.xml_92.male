If I wake up tomorrow, nuthing bad happened,  if I don't......    **GULP**        You guys honestly don't know how nervous I am about going to sleep tonight. There is a fear in me that I won't be able to wake up, and that would just suck.  Sure, I would getloads of attention and presents, and get out of the first 2 weeks of school. But,  AT WHAT COST?!?!?!    Peace Out! I finally have more people to talk to.  Spense
