And I get to thinking, which is rare for me;  why exactly am I looking at this ?          Now that is a good question. Some people might say that I am just a perverted little bastard--maybe not far from the truth. Some stupid American kids might claim that it is simply because it's a  nice  ass. Other, more "scientific" people might say that it is because it is a built in reaction of the male mind to be attracted to such things.  While I tend to lean on the findings of the first hypothesis, of me being a bastard, it is a fact that whether we like it or not we often act before we know why.  Such can be illustrated as to what happens in the following situation.  Say, for example, you have three separate people in three separate rooms. You open the door to the first room, on a person who is a kind, peaceable, friendly person. You start up a conversation, which goes basically  nowhere , but this person is content because a simple exchange of friendly language appeals to them.  Then suddenly, out of the blue, you throw a punch; nailing this unsuspecting person in the jaw, bone connecting with bone. You follow up with a swing into the center of the chest, another to the stomach, and as the person bends forward following the hit to their belly; you bring your knee up hard, flattening their nose against their skull.  They cry out in pain, and fall to the ground, collapsing into a fetal position, their hands covering their face for  protection .  You shrug; anything you would have said to the person would have been pointless, as they are screaming too loud to be able to hear you anyways, and then you immediately leave the room, shutting the door behind you, the cries of pain dissipating into echoes.  The second room holds a more distrusting--shall we say paranoid?--person. This person heard the screams from the room next door and is not so content to start a friendly conversation. They first ask what is happening in the room next door. You announce that it is "nothing," so not to disturb your independent variable in this experiment.   Whack!   Whackwhack! Whump!   Same story over again, but this individual does not just stand there. This person actually manages to absorb the final motion, and instead of a knee flying into the center of their face, you only manage to glance your appendage off the side of their head, following a desperate roll they make to the ground. The person is on their feet immediately, hands protecting their body, like a boxer, blood streaming down their face.  They scream at you to get back, but despite their desperate measures of achieving defense-- protection --, you are a better fighter and they are quickly dispatched, following a pair of kicks to their legs and then face.  The third person is a career Kung Fu instructor. As soon as you pass through the door to the next room you are lying in a puddle of your own blood. This person watched you take out the first two people, and was not going to let the same happen to himself. He utilized his skills for  protection .  So despite the fact that we are all different--individuals--we all share the same common goals. Though we may attempt to reach these goals through different means--some of which are more successful than others--we may all want peace, or freedom, or any other type of human-common goal in the end.  The real catcher here is that different means are more successful than others. The end does  not  always justify the means.  So decide now, how you will reach the goals of the future. My way; or the highway?    And then I closed the picture of the luscious bottom and typed this.          By the way; I do not necessarily endorse the looking-on-of-asses. It just happened to appear, from somewhere, in this case. Remember, I  do  tend to be a bastard quite a bit of the time.
