Thursday night, I went to the Belmar with some art history folks... it was funny when Sanem came by and was like, "Now you even hang out with them!" That was in response to how many art history classes I've taken, despite being a sociology student. I'm sticking by my new academic catchphrase, "I have no discipline! (In every sense of the word)."  Friday, I pretty much just ran errands on campus and hung out with Melissa during the day and then I went to see  Van Helsing  with Nick. After the movie, we went to the Ale House and drank with lots of professor types. I was pretty buzzed and tired by 9, so I stumbled home and went to bed. I think my body has taken a lot of abuse the past week or so... whether it be 2 pits, 2 pies, getting work handed in, returning heavy books, insect bites, alcohol, cleaning, and packing...   I've sort of defending a friend for something, but I think that I should stop doing that. I think he should know better, and it's coming to a point where it's getting annoying to hear what he's says.  I think that today I'm gonna rent a movie or something in the afternoon to pass the time.   ***
