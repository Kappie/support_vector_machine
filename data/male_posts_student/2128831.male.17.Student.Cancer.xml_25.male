Whenever something like that surfaces, I can’t help but feel mildly offended, being still alive and all. Anyway! It would explain why geniuses often end up offing themselves, and I ‘m not planning on it. Much. But I digress.       So. that guy argues that the higher rate of Western suicide could be because people are, on average, more intelligent in the Western world. He’s compared national IQ levels with suicide rates. And the thing is, wherever you look, and whatever the culture, the same pattern can be seen: in Azerbaijan, Greece, Kuwait and Chile there are lower average IQ levels and lower suicide rates; in Austria, Korea, Singapore and Norway there are higher average IQ levels and higher suicide rates. He claims that for suicide to take place, a certain threshold of intelligence must be crossed.       I say, balls, yes you need some balls. First of all, writers, psychologists and philosophers have long argued over the reasons for suicide. The problem is that statistics on the subject are notoriously slippery. Take seasonal variations. I’ll bet anything that more people will feel the attraction of the six-storey building on a cold February morning in Hull than on a sunny August day in, let’s say, Cannes. Winter blues, climate and light and all that. Apparently suicidal thoughts reach a peak in January (when the Samaritans get most calls).       Yet in the West the peak months for actual suicide attempts are, universally, April, May and June. Yeah, I had a boifriend who, in April, illustrated that data pretty well. Also, most sociologists have argued that high suicide rates are caused by modern Western life — that something in urbanized, industrialized society alienates us from friends, faith and family, the mainstays of human happiness. Ok, fine. I’d give faith a beyond-the-religious definition. So, I’m tempted to add that it’s not intelligence but self-awareness that, in my mind, pushes someone to suicide. Self-awareness, which comes, often but not always, with education – of which intelligence is only a corollary. The more educated we are, the more able to see just how crap it all is? What about the dissatisfaction growing into despair at the constantly growing gap between what we have and what we want, in a world when the condition to happiness is to be just about everything the media we created throw at us?  Well this is not very clever; I just got myself all depressed now.   The Bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals, and 362 to heterosexuals. This doesn't mean God doesn't love heterosexuals, it's just that they need more supervision.    You know when you hear something that you find astonishing, but then when you think about it for a while you wonder whether it’s really obvious and that you have just been a bit dense? A recent example of this in my life is the realization that the pub in Eastenders is called the Queen Victoria and it’s in (Prince) Albert Square. Wow! On a wider scale my mate Dave never noticed that it is ladies who have boobs and men who generally don’t. (He’s looked a right twat wearing a bra for the last 2 years.)  The point of the story, I was flabbergasted to learn over the weekend that it isn’t just a tiger’s fur that is striped – their actual skin is striped too! (Does everyone know that??) Tigers have evolved to be naturally camouflaged, enhancing their chances of survival. Genius. Their prey does not see them coming, so they have a better chance of getting hold of some lunch. Hunters and their (few) predators have enough hassle finding them.  That got me thinking about how shit us humans are. Why don’t Aboriginals in the Australian outback develop skin the colour of the scrublands to blend in? Why don’t bee-keepers develop tough sting-proof skin? Why don’t cyclists develop glow-in-the-dark skin and extra hard heads?  I can only conclude that humans are not only rubbish, we’re endangered.
