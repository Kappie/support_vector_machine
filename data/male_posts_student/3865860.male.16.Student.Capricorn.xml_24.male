If I could that would be pretty cool. I'm so going to start songwriting properly next week and get my record contract haha then i weel be rich i tell you! Also i really want to make friends with a ghost! They must be so lonely and misunderstood. I want to befriend one. If you are one please e-mail me I want to be friends. Im going to end by leaving you to think whether 'hopelessly hopeful' is and oxymoron or not. I personally dont think it is but if you are hopeless and full of hopes i can see why people say it is.
