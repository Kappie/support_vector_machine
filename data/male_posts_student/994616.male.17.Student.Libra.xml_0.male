I am so glad that i finally -almost-finished my art major work. i just have to edit some video pick up some prints get nekkid and im done. It's great. ofcourse starting next week life = groupwork. Mr O. helped us more in 3 lessons than Mr Baines did in weeks, just shows who's the better... urm... thing.  To rewardmyself for all the art effort i've been doing i bought myself minority report... well.. almost. i bought a DVD that has it on it; Minority Report thus bringing my  dvd collection to a taggering 8 dvds.  Im going to try to get a better comments thingo, im going to see if enetations will work for me now, they were lazy slackers before.  I jus realised even now that blogger and blogspot is working properly almost all the time people arent like yay, just goes to show how humans notice when things dont work not when they do.  Poison Mushroom to my brother for having lots of people over and making lots of noise last night  1up mushroom pokmemon cards i got some ruby and saffire ones!!! i rock!!!
