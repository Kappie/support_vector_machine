Abe left for Ohio a few days ago and Khem left yesterday or something. I probably wont see them until school starts again. Well I am gonna go out with Keli again on Saturday BUT I AM NOT TELLING YOU GUYS WHERE WE ARE GOING. Of course the masterminds of the whole Wednesday thing are no longer here. So until I post again.  >>
