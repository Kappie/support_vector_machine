Like, I had to move a shipment of 13kg propane canisters around the place. Gets pretty tiring, lugging those buggers up and down hills.  When there were customers, pretty much anything went wrong. Barcodes wouldn't read. Barcodes weren't even on the bloody items. Barcodes brought up the wrong items. Argh. And people seem to have an annoying habit of signing for cheques on the wrong damn line. Even though it says on the damn thing where to sign, and I've just shown them. Idiots. Oh, and Sophie R managed to trip over her own barcode scanner cable. *clapclapclap*  Not long left in the holiday...and there was more I wanted to say but theres stuff on TV I wanna watch now. So I'll leave ya with some great One Foot In The Grave quotes:   Victor - *sighing* "Oh well, I've had a good life." *sits back. looks around. gets up* "I'VE HAD A BLOODY AWFUL LIFE!"  and  (Victor has headphones on listening to radio) Mrs Warboys - "I - I- -I just think I might have to kill myself..." *breaks down into tears* Victor - "HAHAHAHAHA, spam, spam, baked beans and spam, ahhhh, thats funny."  oh, and  GO DEVILS, BOO SUCKS TO TEH FLYERS
