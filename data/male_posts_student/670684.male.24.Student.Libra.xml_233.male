I spent most of last summer in Chicago, so I really hadn't felt a truly hot summer for some time now. Yeah, so although I spent 22 years there, I was never really a Louisiana boy, and my absolute hatred for heat (including spicy foods) pretty much confirmed that. Me and the Sun just do not get along anymore. The Sun is like a big dodge ball for fat people. It's inescapable, it causes a lot of pain and misery, and it makes a fatty feel trapped, weak, and uesless in the game of life. I'm a polar bear fatty. I sleep with my windows open and the fan on in the dead of winter! Speaking of which, be right back...... Oh wow, I just opened the windows, and it's 60 degrees outside! Now that's what I'm talking about!   I think I want to move to Alaska to make sure I never have to experience heat again. I can deal with the blistering cold wind if it means I don't ever have to sweat anymore. It's deceivingly cool right now, and I feel paranoid. While it feels fandiddlytastic, good neighbors, I worry that with our shrinking ozone that this heat wave will not be the last for Portland. OK, so for the people back home in the Dirty South, 93 degrees with 28% humidity would be a blessing, but this was a heat wave for Northwesterners. Air Conditioners were sold out everywhere this week. I'm going to wait until it gets cool next week and the stores have restocked and dropped the prices back to normal, and then I'm going to make my budget conscious purchase to protect me from any future discomfort.    One day, I can tell my kids that Sears made me a Canuck     Actually I could have bought a 5000 BTU window unit on Sears.com and had it delivered for free within 5-7 business days for only $88. That wasn't soon enough for me, because I was HOT and I could not take it anymore. So, like the mad crazy weak bitch I am, I roughed the massive crowd and went into Sears on Thursday. Although miserable and sweating like everyone else, I walked out empty handed. See, to my surprise, the price for the same unit online was $160 in the store. I told the sales person about the sale online and he said, "Well, that will take you 5-7 days to get. By then the heat wave will be over. If you really need it now, you'll pay more. You won't find a cheaper unit in Portland...." I told him to fuck off and walked out.    Fucking pigfaced capitalism! Instead, I went to a dirt cheap motel and spent two nights with truckers and transients in a small box of a room with 70s wood paneling, lying naked on my own comforter I brought to cover the nasty, rickety bed. Sweet Satisfaction among the filth! I put the air conditioner on full blast until I couldn't bear it and ignored the possibility of pestilence. Thank you, Holiday Motorlodge for helping me beat the heat for only $15 per night. Fuck you, Sears for helping me realize how fucked up this great money grubbing nation really is! Screw Alaska, because even though it's 1000 miles away, it's still in America. As the temperature drops outside, I wrap my Canadian Flag sheet around me and dream of Calgary...Some day, it'll happen, someday it'll all come true, ay....
