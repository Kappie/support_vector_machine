I for one would gladly pay large sums of money to see Ambassador Keyes debate the media-dubbed boy-wonder Obama on national television. Though I don't pretend that Mr. Keyes' chance of being the selected candidate is very good, or that, if selected, he stands much chance of winning, I think any race in which Mr. Keyes participates, or for that matter any candidate who must challenge him, will be much better for it. Please, Illinois, give us Keyes!
