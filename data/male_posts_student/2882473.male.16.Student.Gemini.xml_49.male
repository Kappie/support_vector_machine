These both made me struggle not to laugh, as the people involved were less than 3 meters away, but now in the safety of my own home, I can blog about these people for the whole world to read. :)  1. As we (me and big sis) were queing up to pay at the checkout, who should walk up to the counter next to ours but *dun dun da daaaaaa!* The Checkout Captain! Who just happened to be wearing the bright orange fleece, with the words 'Checkout Captain' in large, bright blue letters on the back :) She must have been so very proud! Immagine: You checkout is broken, no-one else can help, maybe you should call... THE CHECKOUT CAPTAIN (Hint of The A Team there). What do you think she wold write on the national census? Ocupation: Checkout Captain? Ahh, the laughs I had... probably just some strange form of motivation, to make the workers feel needed.  Moving on to number 2 amusing event...  2. Waiting for the lift up to the carpark. You may or may not know (probably not) there are 3 lifts leading up to the carpark above the store. 1 lift is for staff with trollies only. Leaving 2 left. As we walk up to them, we press the button for the middle lift, as the one on the left is for staff, and the one on the right has a piece of bright yellow tape accross the doors saying, in BLACK CAPITAL LETTERS  DANGER. DO NOT USE.  We waited about 30 seconds, then who should come out of the right hand lift but a large, old man wearing a bright yellow coat, pushing a trolly who then says to us 'Oh, don't use this one, it isn't working' I resist the urge to point out the brighy yellow notice on the lift door and say something along the lines of 'blind idiot'. So, the middle lift finally arrives, and we all get it. Me and my sister, the stupid old man, a young woman and another old man, all with trollies. We're all in the lft, the first old man pushes the buttons. He then starts to make small talk to us all, in the confined volume of the lift. 'Did you know they're going to do some building work on the church down the road? Yes, it was about time some work was done on it' He didn't get a reply. Maybe just a nod, and posibly a smile.   Well, me and my sister joked about these evemts all the way home in the car. What laughs we had...   Playing:  Tetris  Listening to:  Stompp's Sleeping  Watching:  Old Friends this morning  Annoyed with:  Neopet staff  Confused about:  That old guy  Mood:  Happy
