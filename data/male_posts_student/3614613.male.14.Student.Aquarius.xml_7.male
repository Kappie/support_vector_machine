Daddy was complaining, (I'd say whining but on second thought I'd better not) over and over again to mommy for letting me get the camera. The point I see in this whole matter is that if even I don't complain, then he has even less right to do so, after all, it's my money. For now, I'll just play with the new toy of mine. I've posted pictures, all of my sister, because she's the only one who is decent enough to be taken and she loves having her cutesy face taken.
