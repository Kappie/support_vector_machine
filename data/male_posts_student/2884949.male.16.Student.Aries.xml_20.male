Oh well, I suppose I'll do better on Monday haha.  But today so far has been excellent. I got the new Invader Zim DVD, which rocks totally, and a little later I get to go skate. So this day cant really go wrong haha. Well, I have nothing really to say anymore, so Im gonna go. I'll write in here to talk about my skate day.  Later,  Jerry
