There ARE some parts of a physical that bother me (when they get down to the personal parts; you know what I mean), but I'll live. After that, I'm home for the rest of the day.  Next week is week 4 of 5 at White Stadium, which I plan to go to (since I need my last 6 hours anyway, and I have nothing better to do). After the 5th week, it's vacation for me. No, I'm not all excited for it, but I'm not running away at the sight of it either. We'll see how it works out.   Edit @ 12:37 PM:  I haven't gained much weight over the past year, and if anything, I only grew an inch taller. Also, I seemed to have had wheezing problems when I was
