I thought that was pretty cool since I hadn't ever thought of that. (http://joufy.blogspot.com/)  I've realized a dissapointing fact recently. Basically, if I want to try to keep writing for the rest of my life, I won't ever be able to have a nice luxurious house with an amazingly beautiful backyard even if I could have it. Once you have that, there won't ever be anything  entertaining enough to write about. Nobody wants to read a tale of a perfect life, it would get boring very quickly (after the first page) and every reader would become extremely jealous.  I've started to write my short story. I can't say a whole bunch more than that but I am having a little trouble with the exposition.  By the way, me and my brother realized that all really good artists are from international countries but mostly from Britain. So, from now on, I will be watching Monty Python non-stop and the BBC in general. I will learn their slang, language, and accent perfectly and then I will replicate it. Then when I start a band or get into college, everyone will think I'm British and then I'll automatically get respect for studying overseas and not being an American.  Oh, one more thing. There is only one very extensive short story website on the web (http://www.short-stories.co.uk/) and a great job to them but where is our American site? Are we going to let everything be taken over by those British? Hurry you all, we need to scramble and set up some competition.
