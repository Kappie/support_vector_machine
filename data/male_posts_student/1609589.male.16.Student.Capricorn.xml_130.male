The whole movie is this dark dreary movie that would probably either give me a headache, or cause me to fall asleep(probably both) if i had to watch that crap for an hour and a half.  I don't give a crap about vampires or werewolves. How are werewolves advanced enough to put UV rays in their freakin BULLETS again? I thought they were man-dogs.
