We moved one load and then came back for a 2nd load with the truck.  The second time we came back and Laura, Cindy and Nola had cleaned the majority of the apartment.  It was sooooo nice to have so much help.  So we moved everything in and put everything away for the kitchen.  It looks really nice.  Laura and Cindy did a fantastic job organizing everything for me.  Luke started up the grill and we cooked hotdogs and hamburgers, had chips and soda.  Laura made cupcakes, so that was a great dessert.  We hung out for awhile, but mom and Nola finally left.  Laura, Luke, Cindy and I played Skip Bo for an hour, watched some TV, but Laura and Luke ended up leaving for the day.  Cindy and I hung out for awhile and watched TV, played with the cat, but eventually, the night came to an end and I dropped Cindy off.  I finished unpacking and went to bed, realizing I had to walk to work in the morning.  Tuesday came and it was nice to wake up at 8, shower, eat breakfast and do everything and still be to work at 9.  Well, I was a couple minutes late.  Work was blah, but we did go to a training session at 1pm for the new HR system.  That was boring too.  I looked into cell phone plans, made an appointment with the vet for the cat, and planned the evening.  So Cindy and I walked back to the apartment, which goes a lot faster when you have someone with you.  I just realized this daily recount of my life is really boring.  I need to do what Cindy does and only post funny highlights.  I'll start that for the next post, promise!  We headed to the Verizon Wireless store in Henrietta.  The guy was an absolute idiot.  He had no idea what I was talking about.  He didn't even know the name of their internet service.  I'm considering a cell phone with internet instead of cable internet, but they won't let me keep my FreeUp phone number.  It's impossible to port to their post-paid service.  WHAT!??  Why the heck not?  That turned me off real quick.  We left frustrated and hungry.  Especially hungry.  We headed to Wendy's, not to eat, but for Cindy to apply for a job.  But we got a Frosty too.  But the real gem of the evening was WalMart.  I needed a bike and a couple supplies that I didn't yet have (toothbrush, bike, shaving cream).  So I harassed Ryan, the Bike/Fish/Sporting departments guy (he looked 17).  But he was very polite and didn't get annoyed with our jokes.  I bought a nice $100 bike, a U lock and a bike cable.  One to secure the back tire, one to secure the front tire, bike frame to the bike rack. (By the way, securing it this morning was a pain in the butt.)  Getting the bike home was fun, the trunk was open, the bike was holding on with its own weight.  But we got it home and the kitten was happy to have something new to stand on, other than the bird cage of course.  We hung out, played Skip Bo, watched TV, and I returned my friend to her place of residence, only to get a phone call at midnight asking me how to get my laptop I lent her onto the ResNet internet.  That wasn't fun, I couldn't think I was half asleep.
