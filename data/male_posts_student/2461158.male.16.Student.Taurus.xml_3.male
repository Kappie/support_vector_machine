Well one good thing that happened today is that I got a package! That's right I got a late Thanksgiving gift. Guess what it is. Well I got some practice nunchukas and a boken practice sword. Oh I just wish I were well enough to have fun with them. Well I'm so not feeling well so I'm gonna go get some rest. Oh and cross your fingers for me so that I can get well enough to go contra dancing.
