Well now it is hard to write about anything.  So this will probably be boring.  But today after school Tyke talked with some people and ate some 3 hour old Mexi-fries which had a weird taste to them but he trudged on and ate it.  Then he went home and did some hw (omeork) and that was cool.  Haha that was funny.  By the way, Haras is amazing.  And sooo great.  Not to mention the fact that she is my favorite.  Now that says a lot.  Cuz believe you me, if you did not know I am easily a 13 on the Ladies Man scale (size of scale omitted on purpose).  Anyway, Tyke got sidetracked.  He went to Party 4 Less after dinner and then to gymnastics.  He played a couple great games of Apple Ball before leaving.  This is almost time to stop.  Get well Haras should be said.  She might not be feeling well.  (sad face).  night all.
