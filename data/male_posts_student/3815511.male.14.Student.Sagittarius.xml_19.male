I have been banned by my stepparents (mr. havel lookalike andy and mail-order bride valia). The reasons of why I am being punished in this unusually cruel way is... for punching my sister at my dad's house and telling her to "beat it your time is up" and talking on AOL instant messanger all day while my parents were at work screwing off. At my Dad's house soon after doing the previous my stepsister ran to my stepmom and made herself cry so that i would be banished from the fun machine. At my mom's house I have a 1 hour time limit for the internet. I was on the internet for only an hour, (when SBC kicked me off) after this I could not look at internet sites but could still talk to people on AIM because the internet connection was not closed off. I continued to talk to various species of humans and machines when my stepfather waltzed into the doorway and yelled at me saying, "You just don't get it, i have that time limit for a reason." I then stormed off into my room thinking of what pennywise the dancing clown would do in a situation like this. He would crawl out from the sewer and call out his name thus drawing him near the stormdrain he would then offer him a balloon. Andy being childish in nature would accept the gift and pennywise would grab is arm, rip it out of it's socket, maybe take a bite out of his armpit and say "you will float down here they always do!". This would be the end of andy but unfortunatly for me i find his fatty body disgusting and would never be able to take a bite out of his armpit and i am not nice enough to offer him a balloon. If you have any storys of being banned from the computer or evil step parents put them under the comments bulletin...NOW!
