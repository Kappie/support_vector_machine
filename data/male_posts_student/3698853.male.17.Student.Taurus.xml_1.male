We kind of have a flea problem with our pets, and a few of them got into our family room. That last statement kinda seems random, but it's actually a segueway into another random statement. So, anyways, I was hiding on the couch from the fleas, and two jumped on my leg. I caught one and tried to kill it, but when I checked to see if it had died, it jumped away. T_T. _One thing has always been a mystery to me. I thought there might be some authority pertaining to this subject, but I have yet to see a definitive statement. What it is: Are Filipinos considered Asians or Pacific Islanders? ... Okay, so I asked a Filipino friend who is more closely associated with our ethnic background, and he says we think we're Pacific Islanders, while I hear from Margaret Cho that we're Asians. I've added up and balanced all the stereotypes in a mental Venn diagram, but it seems we're stuck in this gray zone. This has plagued my mind on many a standardized test. In any case, I've decided to put that aside for now and just accept whatever labels I receive. Except that being a Pacific Islander might have benefits in scholarships C,C. I've never really associated race with people. It's always just been person and person. Not until recently, in our studies, have such things as racism been brought to the forefront. _For some reason, I've found my muse again. I'm not quite sure what it is exactly, but I've been on a writing spree lately. I've been staying up 'til six in the morning just writing. Actually, on a material basis, I have not made it that far since the beginning of summer, but the fact that the juices are flowing in my mind again makes me glad. I wanted to start a comic just for summer. "Suburbania." I suppose Peanuts already covered that, but I s'pose I could take it a step further. It would just be an exercise in practicing drawing on my tablet, since I cannot scan as of now and still do not have Photoshop when people all around me do. I've had the urge to draw lately, but I'm afraid that if I start it up and fail I won't want to do it anymore. Or worse, I won't want to get my summer work done. _Recently, my self-esteem's been pretty low. I don't really like myself. I can't blame it on media or oppression like other people. It's just my own inner conscience suppressing any ability of mine to accept who I am. I'm not reluctant to be who I am. Or am I? I can never tell. Confusion has always been an integral part of my life, that, at least, I've come to accept. One thing I pride myself on is my honesty, albeit, frank honesty, when it comes to how I feel towards others, but unlike MacBeth, I lie to myself. I don't think I'm quite ready to talk about everything that goes on internally, but I  am  making progress. _With all this free time on my hands, I've been able to take a step back and view the world and people's views. For a long time now, I've wondered what could have possibly made me so bitter and cynical from the once trusting person I was my freshman year. Perhaps, being such a naive person earlier made it that much more difficult to cope later on. eh... but what do I know? Self-examination and self-assessment has never been a strong point of mine. Sometimes, I dunno, it just makes me sick to think of all the horrible things humans do. Sometimes religious zealots too, in the name of "God" or "Allah" or what-have-you. I mean, logic that even a child possesses should tell you that what you are doing is wrong. I don't see how humans can bore that hole into the very essence of what makes humans humane and replace it with the capacity to do such twisted things. Everywhere I look, hate, when there are so many good people in the world too, but their voices just aren't loud enough. They get drowned out by the sensational evil things that people do. *sigh*... It would seem nothing anyone can do will ever fix what humans have wrought upon themselves. _Oh, what? oh yes. You were wondering about the title? Well, we got Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which I have been craving for some time now, and while I was eating it, I read the box (like I always do, to keep myself occupied). And I saw Wendel the baker and wondered, "what happened to the other two bakers?" eh... *researches* AHA! http://www.lavasurfer.com/cereal-generalmills2.html Bob and Quello? huh... I'll bet Wendel ate them.
