So, yeah. Wear sunscreen. I'll be a walking pile of skin cancer in a little while. I am also currently glowing with the approximate hue of a lobster.  I've been talking with lovely Miles lately. I can't understand why people can be so ignorant and hypocritical. See, Miles and her fellow Ian should like to hang out more, but Ian's possessed mother, a turn-face Christian, is so goddamn closed minded. I mean, I am friends with plenty of Christians, but there are always extremes. This woman pledges openness, yet, in the same breath, slanders anyone who does not give their entire life and half of their firstborn to Jesus H. Christ. So now Ian is grounded, holed up in some travesty of a shelter whilst his mother pounds the goddamn bible into his head. Fucking what. Just because they know each other, Ian's mother goes insane. Just because they know each other, that bitch refuses to understand that his whole life of pain and struggle is becuase her glorified one sided mindset is not compatible with what his mind tells him. He is not a fucking disciple. Ian is a human, and he has the right to choose her own path.  I apologize. I need to go calm down. We have an idea for rebellion.
