It was like giving my  hair  a milk bath.    dove is the only shampoo that contains one moisturising cream to nourish and moisturize your  hair ...yada yada   The other night when i was out drinking, my friends asked me:"Why do you keep on touching your  hair ?" I didn't realise I was playing with my  hair  the whole night!   I just couldnt help it!'  It is interesting to note how interesting it sounds when you replace all the "hair"s that appeared with a censored sound (i.e. *toot*)...   Another one starts off like this...  When i was in Paris for two months, i had no time to take care of my  hair . It was really dry and scratchy, and like,   limp, and dead.  That's all folks!!!
