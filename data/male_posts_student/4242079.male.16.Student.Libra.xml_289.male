I've moved on, of course, but you were, and will always be, I suppose, an important part in my life. Without you, I would be a very different person than the one I am today. And though we may have been so terribly wrong for one another, I thank you for the things I am achieving, the mindset you left me with, the feeling that the "next one" has to compare to you. I've told them all that "I just want to be friends", or that "It just doesn't feel right". It's true, I suppose, to tell them those things. It's not a lie to leave out the reason why, is it?. That the confused girl with the burning passion and utter apathy for everything has raised my standards so high, to such an unreachable level, that nobody I have met would ever suffice. I am greatful for that.   Our promises all become lies, and we grow into very different people. Tim Horton's will not always be there, and there will always be a growing distance and discomfort between two souls
