A DREAM DEFERRED. not only a langston hughes poem, i can make it a lifestyle.  being passive is kind of an odd affliction. you don't generate direct anger towards yourself because nobody really has a reason to if you never involve yourself. on the other hand, resentment can build if somebody takes issue with how you act, or dont act. e nonaction is worse because you leave people in the dark about where they stand in a situation. very recently ive gotten myself into trouble by living like this. my take: people are stupid and i hate them!  catharsis is supposed to make you feel better. after writing this, i feel a lot worse. thus, i think stopping this is in order. judge me as you will; "you can take my life, but you'll never take my freedom." i love braveheart. le fin.
