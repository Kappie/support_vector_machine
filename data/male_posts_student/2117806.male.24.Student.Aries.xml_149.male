That, and I'm really freakin' gullible, and folks can nail me easily.  Let's face it--I probably am way too trusting.  I accept what someone is telling me at face value, most of the time.  And while that's good, it means it's real easy for someone to trick the pants off me on days like this.  Ah well.  Such is life, I guess.  Okay, need to go draw tomorrow's comic.
