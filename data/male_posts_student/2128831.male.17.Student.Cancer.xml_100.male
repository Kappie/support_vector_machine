Why He's HOT: I've never seen Adam in interviews, so I don't know what he's like outside of his character of Seth Cohen on FOX's, The O.C. But Seth is witty, smart,  adorable - neurosis 'n all!  6. JOHN MAYER Why He's HOT: His lips and his voice. Umm...I'm not 100% diggin' his music, but whatever, he's cute! "'Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for"? What's that supposed to mean? Sounds like an egocentric anthem to me. Guys, if you ever want to up that sex appeal, learn to master a musical instrument. (Accordian doesn't really count, unless you're like 80 years old, Jewish,  live in a convalescence home.) Acceptable instruments include: guitar and piano.  5. FINLEY QUAYE Why He's HOT: Listen to his single, "Dice" from his latest release, Much More Than Much Love (2004) and you'll know why! His music is such an eclectic blend of electronica, trip-hop,  reggae. Any guy who can rock a pair of Wallabees is a friend of mine! Interesting Factoids: Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Finley is of Ghanaian/Scottish background. He is also rumoured to be the uncle of Tricky.   4. RIVERS CUOMO Why He's HOT: Okay, whenever I tell my guy friends about my crush on Rivers, they're like "Why? He's an uber-geek!" But therein lies the attraction - shy, smart,  sensitive with just a dash of geekiness. Rivers, if you're reading this - glasses on, hair relatively kept,  facial hair off. Interesting Factoids: A former Harvard student, rumoured to be a "Rice King", re: "El Scorcho" and another something a former coworker from HMV told me - that he hires ONLY pretty Asian girls as his personal assistant. Rivers is probably one of the few exceptions where an Asian-fetish isn't creepy!  3. MIKE WHITE  Why He's HOT: Mike is such a talented writer, penning Hollywood comedies such as Orange County (2002), The Good Girl (2002),  School of Rock (2003). I'd like to believe that you can fall in love with someone based on their talent. What do you think? Sometimes Mike  Gael switch places on my list.  2. GAEL GABRIEL BERNAL Why He's Hot: This chico is muy caliente! I was going to attach a pic of him as a priest in El Crimen del Padre Amaro (2002) because I thought it was soo ironic that Gael Gabriel would be cast for that role. A priest? Since when did you ever meet a HOT, young priest that looked like him??!! Answer: NEVER. Gael Gabriel appears to be comfortable enough in his sexuality to put his arm around his fellow male costars/directors/whoever - geez, if he's gay may I find a razor so that I can slit my wrists. Wait I like guys too! So what if he's 5'6", I don't like guys who are too tall anyways. Foreign men just have this certain kinda allure to them, like they're humble (i.e. non-cocky), more romantic,  they would never cheat on you. Who knows, I could be wrong  Gael Gabriel could be a total dawg with STDs! Sometimes Gael  Mike switch places on my list. Interesting Factoids: Born in Guadaljara, Mexico. Is close friends with Diego Luna, costar of Y tu mama tambien (2001). Can speak English, Italian, Spanish,  French.  1. RILEY PAUL-PATRICK HAYS Why He's Hot: Well, to start off his personality is more important to me.  He is the one of the sweetest, funniest spiffiest bois in the world.  He has this amazing aura to him.  He has the greatest sense in fashion in the entire world.  I would die to live in his closet.  Then of course to his looks.  Baby, damn!  Deep rich green eyes, fair skin the color of ivory.  A small slender frame with a flat stomach.  Needless for me to go on, and I am the luckiest boi in the world since I have him. Isn't it sad that I couldn't even come up with 3 more HOT GUYS in order to do a Top 10? Am I forgetting anyone?  That is all gravy, my baby's up there...  The following blog was the result of my recent contemplations of expanding/changing my current circle of friends: Have you ever seen people and for one reason or another think that you 2 would be good friends? (When I worked at HMV, I would have this feeling whenever I liked a person's taste in music /or their particular style or "look".) If you've had this feeling before, have you done anything about it? What did you say exactly?  Making friends is definitely different if the person you want to befriend is a classmate, coworker, or friend-of-a-friend. What I'm talking about is befriending a complete stranger. Just the mere concept of turning a stranger into a friend is so bizarre to me. When was the last time I put myself out there in order to even introduce myself to someone who had no ties to me whatsoever? Answer: I don't think I've ever do that. Have any of my current friends been attained through my own initiative? Answer: I don't think so. I think they all started off having connections to me somehow. In my surroundings, if a stranger says, "Hi" my instant reaction is, "What do you WANT from me??!!" Also depending on how they look and what the particular circumstances are, I think: Do he need spare change? OR Is he high/drunk?
