I feel sorry for Malaysia , they are hoping for at least 2 medals for badminton and look what happened ..... they crash out and were not even in the quarter-finals. Now they are hoping on the diving event but i think the chance are against them. Nevermind it .... this Olympics certainly is full of suprises especially in swimming , but i pay more attention in Football .... what to do , i'm a football freak and nothing's gonna change that !!
