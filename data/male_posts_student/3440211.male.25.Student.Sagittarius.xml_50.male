My girlfriend was feeling to well this morning lunchtime... hope she feels better now.  Its tricky how things just go high and low in the same day. its very funny.  Will try and cook something nice for both of us tonight. But the heat under this circumstances is just ackward to live by. I guess I am just waiting to be on my hamac between the two palm trees in my garde. Who knows... Its 10 days away but it somehow feels miles away... to a certain extent it would be better if I wasn't leaving but I guess I need the thing....
