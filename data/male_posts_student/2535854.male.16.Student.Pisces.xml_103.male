Me sis called this morning..talked a bit and she mentioned about some insect that comes out every 17years is coming this weekend..eww..she says they are out for 2months..they destroy trees...theres pretty much nothing that can be done about them...apperently they lay theirs eggs and hatch like 17years later..strange..forgot what they are called..its a relaly weird name..apperently the locals there (this is in Cinncinatti,Ohio,USA mind you)they make a big fuss about..they even make food outta them..eww..yuck gross...beyond disgusting!Who wants to eat that?Reminds me of those locust invasions in China that go around ruining all those guys crops...ouch..thats a lotta stuff and money gone...  Talking about money..according to the newspapers,with the number of people migrating from all over the place eg...outside of the city from other states and even Indonesia,KL`s becoming poorer and could be like  NYC  (New York City) by 2009...could the financial situation be that bad?But certainly crime could possably be..with all these coming in..dunno who they are and what kinda characters...and damn damn damn...  Once again lazing here in my room all day on the laptop bugging ppl to come here with the new template and all..  Omg my neighbour who was walking or standing at the curb just like 1 se away from her own was like a snatch theft victim..took her gold necklace and purse...and shes like 70 or 80years old!damn the audasity of people these days...happened at 5:45pm or so..when she was telling my dad at 7pm,he said she was still trembling a bit...god..gotta be more careful these days..gotta away at times with how I am at times I feel..really lucky..specially PBD,a ok la litted car park,lotta walking,running,climbing and looking over my back perpetually looking for an exit!I`ll the story later..  Ok so read Mu 1-1 against Chelsea..nm next year Mu will rise atop english football!And hey,they still got the FA cup final against Millwall to salvage something from this relatively awful year..though i`m sure Denise Wise and co.wont let Mu have it just like that!He`s an ex-Chelsea captain and a battler!  So ok did some pic fixing up for Wei Ning..took a bit time after I found the programs to get it work and bla and editing,it was a peice of cake!  Then went for dinner at La Bodega in Bangsar after some walking around..got a Mixta Valenciana or somethin Paella,Cranberry Juice for myself,and also some chicken in olive oil with those french bread types as an appetizer!Lovely!haha Smsed Cheryl and she seemed to be angry iw as there without her and she told me I better not be havin a Paella..haha..I smsed mocking her but no reply..haha i`ll probably die in school..  Which reminds me,Constance is likely gonna whack me hahaha....I sent some freaky or not freaky but de-moralizing chain sms to Hana regarding exams hahahaha and she said she`ll personally come over here to kick my ass hahahaha...and she sky was clear...passed by Mich`s hse..damn her voice is loud..wonder who she was talkin 2eh ;)?hahaha..she and Rizal..classic la..gog read her blog(its Michelle or Mae Sau under the blog links on the side bar) and read her latest entry..wahlaumak..and sent Afandi the pics taken on Friday during physics since En.
