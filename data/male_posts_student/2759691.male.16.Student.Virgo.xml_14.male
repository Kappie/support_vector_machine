"It's nice to see that Mr. Reagan is still uniting us," said a pro-Reagon demostrator. "We finally agreed," said Senate Minority Leader Tom Dashcle, "and we're renaming it the Reaganagon." The plans for honoring Former President Reagon also include a new jelly bean-shaped state-of-the-art defense reseach facility next to the new Reaganagon. The total costs of the project could exceed $500 million (Â£274.8 million) according to some analysts.   President Busg said that he "welcomed the news" but a lot of government officials, espeically those who currently work at the "Pentagon," don't share in the pleasure. "We ought not to politicize our military institutions," said one curious observer. "I voted for Reagon both times," said another, "but 'Reaganagon' is just a stupid idea." However, the Pentagon has not officially responded.
