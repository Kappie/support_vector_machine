I played quite a bit, and i've gotten pretty far.      Well, yesterday, i played through to Revolver Ocelot (and when trying to beat him on Boss Survival, died about 8 times from killing Baker), and then we went to see Supremacy.  So, i asked if i could borrow it, because it looked cool, and i did.      Well, today, i started a new game, this time watching all of the long cinematics.  Yup, all of them up to this point.  Every word.  Even answering the dumb calls that say "Press the Action Button to climb up and down ladders".  Yes, i know stupid things, but i did answer every call.      Some things that i got stuck on: Where to find Meryl's frequency.  The tip was "look on the back of the package".  I check my inventory... no package.  I back track through out the game... no package.  Check gamefaqs (after about 20 mins of searching): it was on the back of the game box... i never thought of looking outside the game.  Also, finding my way out of the main tank depot.  Never thought of using my cigs.  ^_^  Brillant tip from Nastasha.      Well, where i am now is right after beating Ninja or Grey Fox, and meeting Otacon.   That guy is a little to gay for an Otaku.  I'll keep you posted!    Lates
