Spoon boy: Then you'll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.    www.ebaumsworld.com... I have come to the conclusion of all the illusions that we see online and mathmatical equations that lead to your number you had picked and have figured them all out. Everyone of them, it's made by professionals, nothing is bending but your mind, and your mind allows yourself to believe in it all. But it is not what you think.   So... today in track I ran 10 laps or so, maybe more, maybe 11, in the rain in 15 minutes... not bad. Then I came home and played drums for about an hour and a half. I'm awesome. Then I watched Pamela Anderson on Scooby Doo, then went upstairs on this computer, told everyone 50 Cent had his head blown off by the raging Christina Aguilara and her 9mm, then my sister who's 7 directed me to www.ebaumsworld.com This all is sick shit you gotta check it out, then I went to bed.
