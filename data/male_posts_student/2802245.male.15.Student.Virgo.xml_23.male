Three words plus some dots (I do recall someone else who uses dots a lot :|):    STEAM SUCKS... BADLY   Yes, all 1.6GB of it. Funny the way it takes up more RAM than the Windows kernel itself. Also, weapons are "reversed", so any old 1.5 models you wanted to converted either has to be mirrored (have to use Milkshape which i can;t be bothered) or the models appear on the left hand although it says clearly in the options menu:   weapons: right handed  >:(  Also due to the fact none of the hosting options work, or/and STEAM has generated 29 error reports in 2 hours of playing >:((
