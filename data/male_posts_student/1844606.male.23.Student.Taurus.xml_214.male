Every night I start thinking about the possibility of working as an assistant editor and it kind of scares me.  Self confidence, never had a ton, and after SDavenpo's words on my thesis pretty much burned up whatever was left in regards to editing...But every morning I wake up thinking things wouldn't be so bad.  There are some definate positives.  I know this community and can get around pretty well, as opposed to Chi. where if I'm feeling sick I would have to contend with riding the EL to get things done.  Plus, I'm guessing that getting a grand as a paycheck every two weeks wouldn't be too shabby.  But can it buy happiness?  I don't know.  I'm pretty sure I could do the job, but I'd most likely make it way more stressful than need be. Cause I like to be perfect and going line by line looking for grammatical things that may or maynot be there is really disconcerning.  And I'm starting to get these anxiety panic freakouts while going over this test...Probably cause I know there is a lot riding on it but, Jesus I can't calm down. Its the most intense mix of isolation, stir craziness, bordom, and wanting my life to get on with it I've ever experienced.  And I've already got two consecutive summers under my belt of this feeling.  Plus feeling sick don't help much.  God damn this place.  I just think maybe there is a limit of living in this town for four years for a reason.  Uggggggggghhhhhh.  Time to sleep for 10 hours and feel exausted the entire day.  What's up with that?
