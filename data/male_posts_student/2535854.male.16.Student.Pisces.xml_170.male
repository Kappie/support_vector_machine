Lately Bangsar has been getting quite cold at night..I don`t think ive used my air con in about a week.I dont mind.Can reduce electric..let my parents use away at their air cons..heh..Partly cold cause it rains quite often now..also at night..but theres something about this place..It hasn`t quite been cold like this all of sudden for like quite some time..you think something is err happening?Nah...  Lately ive been able to sleep early!yeah!to a point I wake up so often at night now and have trouble sleeping still at 6am...well mainly this is cause of the fact I can like sleep early is that I get my homework done now during the day time and not wait til night time to do it!been sleeping at 11pm or so the last few nights though tonight wont be so on target.More like old times.Hehe.Despite getting almost 8 hours sleep (I wake up at 7am most of the time hehe),I still remain sleepy in school and fall asleep.heh.  Lately still..a lot of people think that theres something going on between me and Alia Alias..well I doubt many people are gonna read this and stuff...but for the record...there is NOTHING going on between us.Okay fine I lied.Theres something going on between us.That is a good FRIENDSHIP!Thats right!We get along really well..She`s a really sweet person.Heh.Turns out alotta people ask her about if shes having anything with me.haha.People these days.Hehe.If anyone asks,I deny and then start insulting away at them if I can retaliate in a similiar sort of matter.Nyeh nyeh!  Lately lately lately...well my blogging craze or crave is back and kicking for now!  I`ll just DREAM ON!
