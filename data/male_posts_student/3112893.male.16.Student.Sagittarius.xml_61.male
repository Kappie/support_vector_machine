While it is true that I all-those-good-things my dad, my mom is also very cool too. Just keep that in mind. My mom is a good lady and is highly cool. Period. End of story. And I don't even want a comment on the subject, unless it's from my mom agreeing. The silly lady found out about this damn thing and now feel really bad, but I'm not just writing this to make her feel better. I honestly mean it, my mom is cool and awesome and very nice lady and all that good stuff.  That is all. -- Feanor
