You guys know what I'm talking about it - Alot has to do with my motives, and alot has to do with my stupidity.  I've been learning myself alot about consistency, if that made sense!  I'm sure you all know about the events happening in my life lately, ALOT! I've learned alot too and I'm thankful for all that.  I've just learned, now is time to get serious about this thing that doesn't really exist until you're a junior called life!  And guys, we are actually not as mature spiritually as the girls, that's sad, and I'm probably the worst one!  Juniors, I hope we all know that we aren't doing the greatest job that we can at being leaders, and I'm a true believer in that, let's help each other, isn't it about time we look to our futures, look to what God has in store for our lives instead of our little fun time during school.  That's what I've learned.  I'm not pointing fingers, or trying to preach, but if we want to have a great year, we need to get a hold of this!  I love my class so much, you all rock.    Help ourselves out - Wilbo
