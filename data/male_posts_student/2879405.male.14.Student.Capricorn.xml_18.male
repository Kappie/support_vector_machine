Catholic High fielded all their best players to beat our mixed team which consist of juniors and seniors.(Must let sec 1 experience mah) Although losing to Catholic High wasn't as bad as montfort, we still lost! 1-8. We can only pray hard that we win Chinese High in order to even have a slim hope of getting into the 2nd round.
