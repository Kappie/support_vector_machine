It's always the same.  Some joker from the Weather Channel goes to the heart, er, the eye, of the hurricane and stands there struggling to report while howling, 120 MPH winds blow, ridiculous levels of rain fall, and boats, trees, and other debris fly dangerously close to the poor sap tapped to report on this one.  The guy is always yelling at the top of his lungs, trying desperately to keep his balance.  "Well, it's pretty nasty out here!  As you can see, it's raining, and there's lots of wind!"  Then, after the intense "eye" report, they go immediately to the guy who went to one of the areas where the storm  could  have hit, but didn't.  He's bone dry, and usually it's sunny, or maybe just a little cloudy.  "Pretty calm here," he says, not missing a beat.  "Looks like we got lucky this time.  Back to you."  It's the same thing every time.  And it's awesome.    While the coverage of hurricane Charley does not rival the 21 day snack-fest of coverage that I went through during the DC sniper ordeal, it's as good as it gets when there is no other news.  Plus, this time some super intense reporter,  urlLink Jim Cantore , was telling people to get out of their homes and to higher ground.  He said, "I hope you heard me, because I'm serious.  Get to higher ground; you've got two hours, tops."  He sounded like a professional wrestler calling out an opponent.  To him, perhaps he is.  And his only opponent is Charley, all that is evil.    The coverage is made at least a little bit better because I'm in the middle of a feederband right now, watching my weather map in motion, trying to figure out just how bad it's going to get.    My buddy Ryan has to deliver pizzas tonight.  Gainesville is expecting at least 6 inches of rain, sustained winds of at least 50 MPH, gusts up to 90 MPH, with a tornado watch and flood warnings until at least 2 AM.  But Five Star Pizza is open for business.  Sucks for Ryan, but when I get hungry, I think I'll order one.    **UPDATE**  It's 8:30 now, and no sign of any intense rain.  Bumout.  But the pizza was awesome.
