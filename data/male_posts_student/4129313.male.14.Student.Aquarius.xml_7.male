I'm not the best writer in the world, but as I get better, and older, I will make this alot more interesting to read. Also if you can send me some money I can keep yall updated while I'm at school on my new notebook computer that I used with your money (please contact me if your interested in sending me money ;) )  As usual, I read all through second period, but since I finished my other book (Gathering Blue,) I am now reading the next one. (The Messanger) This one combines the story from The Giver, and Gathering Blue, it has pretty much all the same characters (Jonus, Gabe, Mat, (now Matty) Kira, Seer, (Kira's blind father)) and a whole batch of new one's, so I'm realy getting into this one. I am glad second period is an extra period for me, because with how my day's are, I hardly get to read at all anymore.  Third period was boring as always. A kid I know last year tranfered into my math class, the same idiot that was boo'ed off stage during that freshmen assembly deal when he decided to run for ASB. This kid's not only completely unpopular, he is also EXTREMELY annoying.  Fourth period even more students were moved to the front of the class for failing grades. Pretty soon I'm gonna be the only one in the back of the class trying to keep myself from going insane because of all the noise coming from the front. This is rediculous, these kids only come to school to talk to their buddies, they don't even care about getting good grades, or even passing the 9th grade at all. Hopefuly something will come along one of these days that will make them shut the fuck up.  Fifth period we had to run the football stadium for our first time. We had to run up the stairs, across the top, down the last set of stairs, across the field to the other side, up the stairs, across the top, back down the last set of stairs, check in with the coach, and do it all over again a second time. I made it in 16 minuts or so, but I was supposed to shoot for 12. I'm glad she didn't record the times. After all that was over with, we all went into the gym to cool off.  I had another delicious salad for lunch today, I tryed to grab two chocolate milks this time, because I was realy thirsty and those things are to small. The woman at the cash register must have noticed me try to take the second one and yelled to me "ONE!" It realy suck's that they would give us such a tiny ass carton of milk that would probably be enough for a first grader, and expect us to take only one. Somebody has got to fix these people so that they THINK.  Sixth period wasn't much to talk about, just learning some new words, and reviewing the stuff we already know. Also did some grammer stuff and some basic verb conjugation.  My bike tire was flat again. Had to take it to 7/11 again. Pump it up AGAIN. I swear, these desert thorns are a pain in my ass. I realy need to buy myself some of those unpunctureable solid rubber tubes.
