However I don't get a weekend's worth of relaxing. My days off are Sunday and Wednesday. I don't like the idea of my days off being split up. I still don't know if I passed Calculus. I'd hate to have to put up with that class again. Even if I do pass, Linear Algebra is thought by the same instructor. No escape from that annoyance. I will miss my Programming I instructor. It was funny and made C++ easy to understand. But from the comments he made about our next instructor, it may still be as entertaining.
