Well John Efford got his Minister of Natural Resourses back again that is the only ministry position that went to Newfoundland. Now for Parlimentry Secretaries  positions Newfoundland got one of those positions also it went to our own Gerry Byrne he got Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs under minister Lucienne Robillard. Well for one of the only provincies that shown a Liberal gain in seats he did not throw us in any bit extra. But anyways on to other news lol the Strawberry Festival Committee is going well things are getting planed and I think we will do very well for a small committee of only five members. Also I got my movie Life as a House finially came in which it really goo. I will be going to watch that movie in its entirerty after I complete what I have to do on the Internet. Well thats about all I have to say for this entry. Until next entry.
