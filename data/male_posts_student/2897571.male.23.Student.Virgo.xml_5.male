Life's been busy I guess but mostly I just haven't really felt like writing all that much. The man has got me down I tell ya, the man has got me down!  Anyway, in case you've: a.) been living under a rock b.) don't give a rats ass c.) aren't a real friend of mine you should know that the band is no longer. Jon and I decided it was time to take a break. A long break. A break that could last forever. Matt told us some time ago that he didn't want to play with us anymore. He was basically sick of playing punk rock and he had plans to do something on his own accord. After the initial frustration of Matt's announcement Jon and I decided that maybe Matt leaving is a blessing in disguise. To get you up to speed, we've basically been doing the band thing at least once a week for the past three and a half years or so. That's a lot of time devoted to playing the same songs over and over again and after a while you get REALLY burned out. Matt's timing wasn't exactly the greatest but it never is when someone leaves the band. At that point, we had plans to record an album and had an out of town show in Chicago already booked. Jon and I have massive balls though and we still ended up playing as a two piece. It was incredible...incredibley shitty that is. Oh well, our balls are still huge.   Despite being one man short Jon and I still decided that we wanted to record the album. Jon ended up laying ALL of the guitar down by himself. Keep in mind this kid is NOT a lead guitarist. I really haven't heard the end result yet but Jon did what he could and it worked. Listen, our songs aren't complicated. My guess is that a monkey could fuckin' play some of them. Actually, if you consider TJ a monkey then you could say one actually has (oh, TJ is an old guitarist of ours. Pardon the reference if you didn't know that). But really, I think the end result will be pretty decent. Hey, we're giving the damn things away for free so no complaining, got it?!   On to the marriage front (I was engaged last July 17th to Diane, my girlfriend of over four years). Things are progressing quite nicely. We are currently in the midst of choosing a site for our rehearsal dinner. Our budget is tight but we've managed to narrow it down to a couple of fine restaurants. Let me just say it; planning a wedding is a bitch and I don't recommend it to ANYONE. Get married in Las Vegas if you can, and really just avoid marriage altogether if you can manage. Actually, I take that back. Getting married is a wonderful thing. It's the planning of the wedding that sucks (I had to save my ass on that one).    That's about all I feel like writing right now. I'm bored and I think I'm a bit crabby. Oh, one last thing. My brother Jon joined the Army. This angers me. I wanted to join the Army too. Oh well, good luck Jon. I'm sure you read this.  Oh yeah, the title of this post is a reference to a little problem we had at work today.  urlLink Ants . Little tiny ones, running all over the kitchen counter. Stupid things.   P.S. (It's the last one, I swear) I just read an earlier post of mine. After writing in  this  post that the band broke up and then reading  that  post that said some things about never wanting to break up I can officially claim that I am indeed a dumbass and should never have said those things. Oh well, I must not have knocked on wood or some shit. Shit happens I guess!
