After waiting 14 longs days (even though the suggested shipping was 5-10 days) I have finally recieved my tablature book:   urlLink The Offspring  - " urlLink Americana "  I cant wait to try this out. I have it sitting in my lap...but have yet to try to attempt any of the songs. After I have perfected this I might get a  urlLink New Found Glory  tablature book (if I can find one)
