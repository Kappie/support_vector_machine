Mwhaha oh man it's so entertaining...if only it wasnt destroying the ozone layer while doing it.. I would say no static is worth the UV rays tho, don't you? So like, I want a little counter thing on my blog, who knows how to get one? Tell me if you do. And a little guest book thing. Oh man then I could FORCE people to write in it.. So I just added a link to my..links. Emily's blog! Emily is a good friend that Scott introduced me to a while back that lives in Edina...So check out her pretty blog! :D Next is music..Right now I like some Irish singers, and indy rock. Wait...no...that's not me...Nevermind. Alex just burned me FIVE Metallica CDs. So naturally I listened to five full CDs in one sitting. All awesome. Great stuff. Parents are NOT so pleased about the selection, and when I crank it they get mad for some reason...Psht...Parents.    Soccer...So like I thought we were going to lose TERRIBLY today, but we ended up winning 6 to 1 or something like that, I lost count. I was playing forward the ENTIRE time and NEVER scored. What the heck?! Oh well, at least I had two assists and made some guy cry...I think I might have hit him a bit TOO hard   School...So IB Bio...it's just like WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. AM I JUST MISSING SOMETHING OR IS THE EASIEST THING EVER?! I see why I switched out of that class in the first place.. Oh well it fits my slacking style much better. Slacking is so...satisfying. It's like hey look at me I don't want to work and I still have a lot to show for myself :D. Well not all like that, but it is a lot of fun most of the time. Instead of freaking out and being like oh man im so screwed for this test, it's just like...whatever, what's gonna happen is gonna happen. No panic dancing....   Homecoming ... Oh stupid I had to go to school with a 100 dollar bill today...That was insane, I felt really uncomfortable..My mom made me buy a ticket for my sister too, so I had to get THREE at a time, which was just WEIRD. Anyway, it will be worth it, as long as Christy isn't all pissed at me at the dance for some reason, and starts screaming "I HATE YOU I HATE YOU" over and over. If she does I am throwing a cowbell at her and she shall be knocked unconsious, at which point she will crumple over and everyone will start dancing to techno music. I swear it will happen..   Ok I just had to leave the room because my chest started to hurt. All the sudden the center of my chest got REALLY cold for some reason..Ok people, start calling out what items you want when I die.  Bah it's 10oclock, time to go to "sleep" @_@
