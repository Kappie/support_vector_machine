Well, that is about it. I don't think that I have anyting else to say right at the moment. I hope I can get some people to go with me. Since the person that was going to go is being a betraying little bitch, I don't know who I'm going to take with me. I guess I just won't go...........  Till next time kids........ciao!!!!!!!
