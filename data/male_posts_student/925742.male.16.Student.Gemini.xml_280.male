Haunted House with *ahem* maybe tomorrow or friday, as well?  Sorry, but I deem that more important than playing the umpteenth round of cs.  Well I need to put in some more volunteer hours at the hospital.  What am I up to... 100?  Cool.  Well Friday is the day I go in and since my supervisor won't be there for more than half an hour, its my duty to train the probies.
