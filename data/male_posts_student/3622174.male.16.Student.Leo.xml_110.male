Let me take a minute to reminisce the past month on Blogger:  It hasn't been too long since I signed up.  Maybe a month or less.  With Digital Lust accumilating 4 posts every day, Monday through Friday, and Blog of Bagel getting maybe 2 or 3 a day, I'm not too surprised that I made it this quick.  We've seen three Absolute Boredisms (and I was expecting much, much more by now), two eBay Hunters, and now, tonight, the sixth Late Night Bloggin'.  I've complained several times, and written about 30,000 words.  Yes, it's been quite a month.  If I can accumilate that much in that short amount of time, how will the rest of the year be?  I plan on keeping this thing for a long time to come.  Then, when I feel like I'm done blogging, I'll print these posts out and save them for all eternity.  My teen years are something I want to remember, and this blog thing definitely helps the cause.  Who knows.  Some day, Blog of Bagel may become a published work?  Doubt it, but, hey, you never know what the future holds.  And now, onto tonight's edition of Late Night Bloggin'.  Tonight I'm going to look at just two blogs, and then call it quits for the night.  So, here are your two blogs for the night.   See you in Hell!  Link:  urlLink Click Here  Rating: **  While this one's title is pretty interesting, the blog itself isn't.  Her latest entry, dated tonight, is about Fahrenheit 9/11, and the issues she has with it.  She posted the picture of some chick, and claimed she was hotter than the girl in the picture.  Let's see some pics see if you really live up to that!  This blog is run by two people, Sara and aimeeorleans.  Its the first blog that I have run across that is by two people, so its pretty interesting.  But, hopefully, I'll find one better.   BlogBlogBlog  Link:  urlLink Click Here!  Rating: **  This guy just signed up for Blogger a couple days ago.  His dog, Beta, was sick, but he took her to the vet and she's doing better.  In the post before that, he mentioned that he sent a guy a video of how to complete a rubiks cube for a gmail invite.  Now, I'm not even that crazy, but, he did it.  And, in his first post, he asks, "I Wonder What Other People are Blogging About?"  Well, guess what dude... We're blogging all about you.  Congratulations.  And that's it for Late Night Bloggin'.  In other things to blog about, I worked about an hour tonight, got 3 files completed, and got about $60 doing so, which is awesome for only working an hour.    And, that's it.  Here's to another 100 posts.  That's it from me for tonight.  Tomorrow, Digital Lust gets 4 brand new posts to end another week, and it will be closed on Monday and Tuesday of next week, so I will have Saturday posts this week.  And, tomorrow morning, I start posting my favorite song lyrics here.  So, be sure to check this place out tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow's lyrics are for Midtown's Give it Up, from the Spiderman 2 soundtrack.  It's a great song, I like it, and it's one of the best that I've heard in a while.  I'll see you here tomorrow for more Blog of Bagel action!  Adios!
