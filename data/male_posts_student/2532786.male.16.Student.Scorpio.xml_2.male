This is better than the older version as it has a proper baseline and some chords to fill it out. I'll start adding a drum beat tomorrow to see what it sounds like  UPDATE: 19/7/04 : Added drums and intro  And my popular request (from one person ;) ) here are the lyrics. I have made what the music has in bold. They need changing a bit but are basically the final ones.    Tonight I'm gonna stay till tommorow If only it lasted one day Today I'm gonna stay till I fall asleep Till the voices in side of me say  Just forget all these things that you think that you have in your life Just forget all the memories. Forget everything that she said Forget yesterday  Today i heard you say that your sorry But tomorrow you'll change your mind You say that you will stop playin games with my heart I'm sorry if i find that hard to believe  Just forget all these things that you think that you have in your life Just forget all the memories. Forget everything that she said Forget yesterday   Forget yesterday Forget yesterday I'll forget yesterday  I heard the phone ring at midnight You said that your on your way You try to say you didn't mean what you said Though I cannot believe what you say  Just forget all these things that you think that you have in your life Just forget all the memories. Forget everything that she said Forget yesterday  Tonight I'm gonna stay till tommorow (They tell me to forget yesterday) If only it lasted one day (Forget yesterday) Today I'm gonna stay till I fall asleep (Till I fall asleep) Till the voices in side of me say  Forget yesterday Forget yesterday Forget yesterday
