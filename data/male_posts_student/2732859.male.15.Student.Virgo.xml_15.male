John Kerry is right that foreign leaders are probably saying that Bush has to be beaten and we need someone as President and leader of the free world and the world's only superpower who actually consults our allies before going into a unilateral war.  Do you remember all the goodwill and support that we received from the rest of the world in the wake of 9/11?  The French newspapers the next day said, "We are all Americans".  They sang the National Anthem all around Europe.  Now the US is seen as a threat to world peace.  Anyway, I'm really mad today, I'll see what tomorrow is like.
