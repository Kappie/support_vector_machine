After what seemed to be eternity, Tai Wu woke up…only to see himself on a barren and scorched field with ashes, slightly burning bushes and plantation. In his hands was the heavy sword “Flamer”; it’s heavy, much heavier than any other sword that he had ever held before. The cracked sword which he used previously was now broken.  A lot of doubts and questions are in Tai Wu’s mind now; where is he, what happened to him after the fire, why didn’t the fire kill him, why is the whole placed burned…  Tai Wu tried standing up, but the weight of Flamer made him unable to nudge.  Tai Wu, “What the…How can anyone use such a heavy sword?”  The sword was not emitting the orange glow anymore, its body a beautiful, clear and clean sliver, but it didn’t seem at all sharp, more rather like a sliver stick. Tai Wu summoned all his strength to the arms, with both hands lifted the sword and used his shoulders to support it.  Tai Wu, “Huh…? There’s no sheath for it…”  With that, Tai Wu tore off part of his sleeve and wrapped it around the blade; at least it looked less significant.  He walked around the area and realized that the fire has an enormous range, walking for few miles; signs of burns could still be seen. Tai Wu started to get worried, there was not any life in sight and the whole area is totally unfamiliar to him.  Tai Wu, “Where…where am I? This place doesn’t seem anywhere near to my hometown at all.” He started running frantically, although not much life can be seen…the signs of the fire grew weaker.  “There must be something beyond this place, it would be madness if this keeps going on, am I really in a different place as said by the man?”  He continued moving and finally he heard voices in a distance.  “This has been happening for years! We need to have water if not our crops can’t grow at all!”  “So…this is once a farming land but the fire destroyed part of it.” Tai Wu thought…  He continued walking to the voices and finally caught sight of humans, they were wearing the same ancient Chinese garb as him…seeing someone, Tai Wu felt a sign of relief, that he wasn’t alone. He approached the guys…  Tai Wu, “Err…Hi, I’m lost and can I know where is this place?”  Man A, “ You’re at the south region, controlled by the earth.”  Tai Wu, “ Huh…? What…controlled by the earth?”  Man A, “ You don’t know? The five elemental regions; Gold, Fire, Wood, Water and Earth. This is the south, which is controlled by the Earth…understand?”  Tai Wu, “What the…Isn’t this country Cheng Du?” (Cheng Du, a state of China)  Man B, “What is Cheng Du and China?”  Tai Wu abruptly realized something…it was true…it was true that he’s in a totally different world.  Tai Wu, “No…no way…”  Man A, “Hmm…judging from that sword of yours…you seem to be a fire wielder. The competition for fire wielder’s in the east side, just travel straight from this path here and you’ll reach the capital of yours.”  Tai Wu, “…” He was too much in a shock, all these happened too fast. He stood there for a while, ignoring the curious calls of the two men before proceeding eastward. He had no other clues of how to get out of this world…and after all he did remember the man mention ‘the next wielder of fire’  While moving through the path, everything seemed normal; fields were being plough and life remains the same as his usual scene. However, it did get ‘strange’ for Tai Wu as he began to see ‘strange’ things like a small glass ball covering over a thin metal strip and lighting up when a button was pressed, if not, a thin circular strip wood with a little black substance at the tip of it. What intrigued him more is that the clothing of these people starts to change to button-less shirts and some of the females actually wore sleeveless clothes, revealing much of their arms. (In ancient china, there are no such things as light bulbs, pencils, t-shirt and girls are very proper with their attires, normally girls who reveal parts like upper arm or even up to the knees are considered rude.)
