We went to some Indian place for a meal yesterday. First we went to some pub to meet her workmates and then we went to the restaurant. It wasn't that good in my opinion. The food was nice but it just took way too long to get it. The beer was great though! After the meal (which finished at about 12.00am) we made our way into town and stayed there, doing nothing, for a few hours. It was kinda nice most of the time. We sat by some heaters until 3.00am. Jesus Christ... the ammount of guys who walked past and said, "Alright ladies?"! It was ridicoulous. I'm THIS close to cutting my hair off! Mandy went home this morning. I got the bus with her into Sale to make sure she was safe. HER MUM GETS HOME TODAY! Hooorahhh! No more staying at her dads house! God I hate him. Guess what he said the other day when on the phone to Mandy? He goes, "If I ever meet this guy you're hanging around with, I'll kick his face in, I swear!". Nice. Mandy told him all about me though, but she said he wasn't that surprised. But I really don't wanna meet him. He will stand on my face a bit. Well it's Easter today and I like chocolate, so in a bitsiziziziz. xx
