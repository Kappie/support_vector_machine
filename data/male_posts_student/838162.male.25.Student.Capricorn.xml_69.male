Basically I have no longer the need to make one-off comments like I usually do. The soundtrack speaks for itself.  As we go headlong towards the anniversary of that faithful day that started it all and the faithful days that have followed it, it is easy to lose sight of common goals that we as a species I feel we should strive towards. As I look at the  urlLink night sky  this week, I ask myself how much better it would be if all the resources, human and otherwise, time and energy that we have been using recently to respond to as well as create, the various situations that we now are in, was directed towards that one goal. Or any other common goal for that matter. As long as it takes us away from ourselves and gives us something to work towards together. Yes indeed, how much better it would be.
