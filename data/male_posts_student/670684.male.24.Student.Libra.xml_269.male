When you walk into Babcock Hall, you walk into a mythical 19th Century parlor, with paintings of the hall patrons, Mr.  Mrs. Babcock, adorning the side walls, and a grand piano positioned in an alcove towards the rear.  The room is full of windows and parlor chairs, with four chaste lounges for comfortable sitting (and some comfortable couple enjoying, as a few of our campers discovered).  Turing to your left or right are hallways blocked off by fire doors.  On the other side of the fire doors, this antebellum lounge becomes just another dormatory.  Except it was my dormatory; it was my floor.    When my father moved out of his condo at Hidden Meadows in 1995, he looked back and laughed.   Why did you laugh?  Didn't you enjoy living here?  I asked...I saw no reason not to enjoy it, as he lived on a beautiful hill overlooking a beautiful golf course...the place was furnished, and he was far enough away from the hustle of life, yet close enough to join it as he pleased.  He looked at me and gave me a smirk that I now recognize as asshole-time.   You'll know when you grow up .    When I moved out of my apartment in Arlington, I didn't laugh contemptuously.  I didn't smirk.  But in no way did I miss that place.  Nor did I miss the house on Back Bay when I left there in October, settling down at Rio Nueces.  And when I left Rio Nueces, I only missed it because Brian Thomas and I had such a great time there, and I knew I probably wouldn't live with him again.    This is the first room I will miss since my first apartment in Austin, which wasn't a nice apartment in any light...Mauna Kai Condos off 31st and Duval, a shitty block of 40 efficiencies infested with king sized cockroaches and poor room AC units.  But it was my first apartment.  I bought $100 of groceries that first day, preparing for the bohemian life I was dying to live.  I lived it all right...not the one I was expecting, but I lived it.  I was on my own, paying my own rent, fighting for my survival...I didn't enjoy it at the time, but I needed that experience.  And Mauna Kai was the perfect complex to have it in.    And now, as I pack up my laptop and take my stuff out to the car, ready to drive to another camp and have another one of these experiences, I will pass through those fire doors again.  My renaissance birth canal.
