I also got my seat permanently changed to the front because I made the whole class crack up when I randomly decided to turn my face purple by holding my breath. At lunch, Nick R got escorted to the office by like 20 security guys. I'm not gonna mention any thing that specifically happened. Other great shit happened today, I just can't remember... ah cant be that great if I can't remember it. I have a 5k race tomorrow with Paul. I ate a shit load of spaghetti. I was at the Sp's rink and I was skating the wrong way so a 9 year old just came up out of no where and duffed me right in the jaw. You know what. It felt good. It felt good knowing I resisted to assault, I held in my anger, then again I knew if I had touched the kid, he probably would of needed to be rushed to the hospital. And I would of been sewed. Seriously, he was a little over 4 feet and his punch was like a flower landing on your face or something. I laughed in his face though so he must of felt like an asshole. Later on I went up to his friends and I said "That was brave of you to give me a punch" and all the other kids were like "we have nothing to do with this, dont hurt us, he shouldnt of punched you, he's got a disease"... they were like old Mafia men shitting their pants. So I just told them why don't you guys teach your retarded friend a lesson and I left, see no trouble. Wow, I handled that pretty well... I like little kids, I would never be able to hurt that kid, he was so small and weak. Well he still is a big punk/faggit/orangatang. Ok cya later. Buchmann the night was good. Oh yea, I convinced over half the people at the rink I had turrets, terrets, tirrets, George Foreman? How ever you spell it.
