Actualy I'm doing this for Hollys benifit, because she didn't think I had a journal, and I did think any one would ever read what I would write. oh and i just invented a new word for my vocabulary... eyah, cause I keep misspelling it... basicaly its a "more of a mischeavious form of yeah" pronounced like yeah, but with a έ sound on the front of it. Ok so now after talking to Holly I beleave it that posting here may be more fun than I originaly thought. SO... yes... I was thinking of puting down some guidelines for the reader of this journal, to help guid them thought the randomness of how I will most likley write, but after a second thought it lost the desire to make such a list, and it didnt seem like it would have too much of rules on it, and they wouldnt really be rules for se' but more like "Im gonna wright like this, so tough!" and that could go without saying. So if you know how I am how I wright won't be a suprise.  Also if you start to read this blog latter that this post you wouldnt have read the things I would list, so maby I should put somthing like that in the "about me" page. ah... whateve... I really like elips marks, really I should probably just start a new paragraph every time I use them but έ τι να κάννω; (ok, first time translation... that means "what am I to do?") K so I never got that why is almost all the punctuation in greek the same as english, except the question mark? In greek they use the semi-colen to denote a intarogitive sentence...* Also I really dont get/like how I is capitalized when typing, takes too much effort, and I think it seemes kinda pompus. i guess it wouldnt look right otherwise... oh well. K' so my left sholder keeps hurting, for a little back information it has been doing this off and on for over a year now and its getting really anoying, I think it must be a nerve er somthing. at least its not as bad as when it happened, that was painfull. Ahh now I'm complaining, and sounding untough... um... yeah so yeah so im gonna go out and play soccer now till i bleed or break somthing, caus im so tough!!!! K so that covers the sounding untough... AAAAHHHH!!! i cant type any better than i can spell... though the spelling is not my fault, my dad cant spell, his dad cant spell, and i dont beleave his dad could eather, and we all spell the same... the funny thing is when my dad misspells somthing i cant tell.  **NOTE* after writing this paragraph i decided it lacked actualy content, thuss you may want to skip it and read other parts of this post/journal however it was left in here to make this post seem longer, thank you!** Well it seemes like its time to start a new paragarph... the old one was about me and the journal, this one is about ideas i had today. I had a excelent idea of a mod for a computer... though i dont want to say here so someone will steal my idea, though if you ask me in person ide probably tell you... Also i had a idea of how to make a ton of money, selling somthing that was already invented, though i dont want to give that away eather.... hummmm... i wonder if it has a pattent in the USofA? well this paragraph is excithing!!!! ya'll dont have a clue what im talking about do you... man! k sorry about that.  Well Im runnin out of stuff to rambel about... and the soccer idea is sounding grood right now... so... im gonna go get some icecream... er... somthing... to admit it i dont know how to end a post...wow... its like a letter but worse... well thats all for now... though i feel like im forgitting somthing, ah well, more fo' laters!   *isn't it cleaver how im working in all the "this is how to understand me" things, and giving you a greek lesson to boot!
