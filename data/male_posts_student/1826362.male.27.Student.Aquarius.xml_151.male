THe book has these really high quality photographs of strange japanese foods that Mr. Anthony has tried or encountered, along with a little blurb about how he came into contact with it.  The only one I remember was taco soup (influenced by  urlLink lauren 's experience with urlLink  taco salad ).  The picture was this bowl of soup with a dark colored broth, and this giant white octopus, with its tentacles flailing out of the bowl (it was still alive, apparantly).  Piers wrote that he, much like in lauren's story, had ordered taco soup, because it sounded interesting, and was very surprised to be served a live octopus soup.  I know, strange enough, but it gets weirder. I was then suddenly in a japanese resturant staffed entirely by young americans (in Japan).  there was this big bin in the middle of the place that had all these different types of live birds in it, all categorized by type (pigeons all together in one section, parakeets in another, sparrows in another, and so on).  I asked a guy if the birds were bread to be unable to fly or if they had their wings clipped, and he told me they were clipped.  These birds were killed and cooked to order, one of the waitstaff would pick one up from time to time and snap its neck, and send it off to the kitchen.   Strange enough, but it gets wierder.  There were also these dogs running around the place, like pets with collars and names and stuff.  This one dog had long tufts of hair on his ears, and one of the waiters was cutting the hair and talking to the dog in a singsongy voice, "you won't be running away anymore, will you? Will you?  No you won't!"  (apparently the fur on the dog's ears worked like the flight feathers on the birds).  It came time to kill one of the dogs for a meal, and all the waitstaff gathered around this dog named Rico while a blonde girl spoon fed Rico some poison, and told Rico she was sorry.  Someone took Rico's collar off.  then, thankfully, I woke up.
