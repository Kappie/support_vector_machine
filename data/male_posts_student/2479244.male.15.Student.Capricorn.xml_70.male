Why is it so hard for me to control my anger? Why was I born under this curse?   I want a person to watch me walk. I do it wrong. I want a person to listen to me talk. I do that wrong too. I want a person to watch me sleep. I would wager a pretty penny that I do that wrong. So, tell me, you,   What is right?   I want to know. I want to know so bad. What the hell is this whole "correct," "yes," "good," "well done," "right," shpeel that you people always seem to come across and why can I not seem to figure it out? Is the god damned world that I live in just devoid of  right?  Is there nothing I can do that is the way it should be done? Just stop accusing me for one small second and tell me... what is right? I feel so right on the inside, but it always comes out so damn   wrong!    If it takes a shovel to my head or a bullet to my foot to get me to understand this, trust me when I tell you that I would choose it. The reasons are many and abundant, and if I can't figure this out, time will, in a very, very bad way. Please help me, I am losing a battle that cannot (at this rate) possibly be won, but the prize is far too precious to be lost.   Help me before it's too late.   P.S. - When I maintain radio silence, that's when everything is more or less OK. I only ever blog about bad things, because I know from experience that it is a helluva lot more boring to read about how "wonderful" someone's life is. Wahh, ignorance is bliss.
