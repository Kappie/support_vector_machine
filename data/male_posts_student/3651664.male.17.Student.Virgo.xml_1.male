The kid I was arguing with brought up the whole "Bush Lied" spiel again. And again, I patiently explained how the CIA gets tips from sources, then they try to corroborate the information, then they analyze this information, and then they give it to the President. The President decides if the information needs to be acted upon. I think that anyone who is told, "This crazed genocidal dictator is building banned weapons" would act upon this information. Even John Kerry said last week that knowing no WMD's would be found, he would have authorized force (I already commented on this). The kid still won't cave. So I bring up the fact that mass graves were one of the first things that American troops found when entering Iraq, and that Saddam tried to wipe out the entire Kurdish population of Iraq with chemical weapons. These are documented facts. How can you not care about this kind of thing? Well, this kid didn't think it was important. Even when I brought up the similarities with Hitler's Holocaust, he wouldn't agree that it was right. And last, I pulled out the UN Oil for Food scandal under which Saddam stole  urlLink $10 billion  from his own citizens. Still nothing. How can someone not care about these things? How many reasons does someone need to have an evil dictator removed from power? Liberalism is going to KILL this nation.  UPDATE: Another reason for our involvement in Iraq: Iraqi athletes can participate in the Olympics without fear of being tortured by Uday if they fail. Seeing them in the Opening Ceremonies is truly moving.
