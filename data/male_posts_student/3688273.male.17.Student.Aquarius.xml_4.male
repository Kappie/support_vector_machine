I'm hoping to get a job at the Smoky Hill Library.  As I see it, it's pretty much an unbeatable gig - air conditioned, quiet, and full of books.  Not many hours a week but that's probably a good thing.  Also, pay is not bad at around $10 an hour.  The Village was a big disappointment.  Technically, the movie was very well done - the acting was tight and convincing even if the archaic way in which the characters spoke was sometimes awkward.  The village itself was beautiful, especially at night - the torches ringing the perimeter really were beautiful.  The yellow that was used heavily was possibly the most beautiful color I've ever seen.  However, all this could not save the movie from a terribly weak concept.  I think Shyamalan lost touch with reality just a little bit.  I still like the movie just because it is so pretty, but it had no real substance.  The horror part of the movie doesn't really seem to go with the premise at all.  Indecision is a killer.  Tales of Symphonia is one hell of a game - I've renewed it twice at Blockbuster so far.  It's incredibly deep and the combat system is great fun because it's like combining Soul Calibur with Final Fantasy.  I'm playing through it for a second time to get all the stuff that I missed the first time, but I can see how maybe a third would be required - it's that long.  The voice acting is top notch, too.  GStreamer is pissing me off.  No matter what audio output sink I select, it plays the same half-second or so when a stream starts up - terribly annoying.  I can't use Rhythmbox or Muine (Muine won't even open anymore, complaining about something regarding Mono...) and am stuck with dumpy old XMMS. Fairly disappointing.  Can't seem to find any bugs that match my current problem on Redhat's bugzilla.  I guess I could submit one.
