But due to the 2 week turn around time for repairs, I couldn't risk having them ship it off for repair. I did manage to get my data recovered... at a cost.  It was a beautiful drive at least. The weather was awesome... too bad I couldn't get a hold of Kathy and Eric while I was up there.  I ended up going to Edigan's with Jeff, Wataru, Jeff's friend, and the Turks. It was cool... lots of beer. Afterwards I talked to Steff about the plans for Europe next year... that should be lots of fun... also we'll probably go to Vegas this summer to celebrate our birthdays.  Today was just a whatever day. I returned the car and hung out on campus. I wrote:   602 - 5 / 30  603 - 6 / 7  690F - 11 / 15 : completed one page today  Total - 22 / 52 = 42.3% completed with 15 more days to go.   I'm gonna go home now and eat dinner, then come back to get more work done.  **
