I'll play bass next time.  urlLink Toma  got some well deserved awards today. Except for the Bill Gates award. No offense Toma, but  urlLink Michael Flagg's Computer Company  deserved that one. Good work emceeing all of you that did it! Go Boerner as Michael Jackson! Not really.     urlLink Mandolin  sat by me today during the assembly! Ha ha Mr. Newendork. Thought you could make me sit with my own team twice? Ha.
