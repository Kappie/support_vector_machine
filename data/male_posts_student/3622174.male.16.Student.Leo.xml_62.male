Well, I'm the nerd that has no life.  This new weekly column on Blog of Bagel is called Nerdular Nerdance, and goes past the nerdance that is bagel.tech, and into things that I do that are more nerdier.  This week's topic is Spiderman 2.  This movie is going to be huge, yes, and I am one of the several million Americans who are highly anticipating it.  But, when I was talking to Crandall last week, he said my Spiderman 2 buddy icon was "nerdy."  Well, let me tell you something, Crandall.  Of course its nerdy!  Look at who you were talking to when you said it!   My computer is decked out in Spiderman 2 backgrounds and stuff, but only until Wednesday.  After I see the movie, things will go back to normal, like they were before.  My Windows Login Screen is Spiderman 2 (thanks to something called StyleXP, which I'll be reviewing at bagel.tech later this week).  It's got an 800x600 version of the movie poster, with my username and stuff.  It's one of the best logins I have ever used, and its perfect for the Spiderman nerd.    Spiderman 2: The Game is coming out tomorrow, and you better believe that I'll be in line first to pick it up.  The game features open ended gameplay, similar to Grand Theft Auto, and has got some of the best visuals I have ever seen in a game.  I can't wait to have it, and it's going to be one of my favorite games of the year.  The movie.  This is the big one.  Closing out my Spiderman 2 hype for the year, is the big movie.  Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco have returned, and Doc Ock is the villain this time.  Now, I was never a Spiderman fan until the first movie, but, now, I've been dying to see this movie.  It's going to surpass the first, as far as surprises, suspense, and action.  Harry finds out that Spiderman is actually his good buddy Peter Parker.  Harry is especially upset because it was Peter who killed his father in the first movie (in the first movie, Harry's father, played by Willem DaFoe, was the Green Goblin).  So, in an upcoming movie, for sure, Harry will be the villain.  He's got to be.  So, now you know how much I've nerded out for Spiderman 2.  Tomorrow, be sure to check out bagel.tech for some brand new updates, including a special night time edition, where I'll go indepth with the Spiderman 2 game that I'm buying.  I may even have some screen caps of it.  Remember, the bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway is coming soon, so be sure to check bagel.tech so you can find out how to win.  I'm also going to post here tomorrow morning.    Tonight's Blog of Bagel update is brought to you by Sony Pictures, who paid me to say...I mean, the creators of Spiderman 2, in theaters June 30th!
