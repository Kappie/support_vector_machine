I have possibly the worst cold I've ever had, combined with hayfever, and my whole head is over-loaded with flem and snot and smeg. It's also spread to my ears, and I've gone half deaf. Guns N' Roses never sounded worse.  So, I may be back at school tomorrow. Maybe not. If I am, keep away. It's probably contagious.
