You see too often that people lack the spinal solidity to do the right thing when they potentially have something to lose by doing so.    And you see the same thing on the global level, as well, although I shudder when I hear people talk about countries being our "best friends."  As I've said before, we don't have friends, just strategic alliances, and as strategy and national interest changes, so do alliances.  This is the way it is and always has been, with everyone, not just the US.  Global interests are addressed when it becomes clear that they overlap national interests, as with Iraq.  It is in everyone's national interest to get rid of Saddam.  But back in the whole MLK quote vein, this is what France and Germany are failing to see.  They're refusing to back us up, refusing to confront evil because, at least in France's case, they know that in the debris of war, the international community will find evidence of their arms sales and oil interests in Iraq.  Fine, France... we saved you from Hitler, we saved you from the rest of the world, and now you stick your nose in the air?  Don't be surprised if the next time you need help, you get a giant centrally located finger raised instead.  Sayin'.  I've been listening to Toto and Steely Dan nonstop for the last 24 hours.  "Rosaaanaaaaa, Rosaaanaaaaa"  Heh... Someone grew up in the 80's, and iiiiiit's me.  Okay, there's laundry to be done, and IIIII'm gonna do it.  I'll leave you with this bit of zen from last night's Hannity and Colmes...   Hannity:  The PETA people, the animal rights people, they hate you, don't they?   Ted Nugent:  Oh I'm so proud.  I couldn't be more proud.  Every time they speak up, I kill a dozen of something just for them.   God love Ted Nugent.  The man and his sporting association provided 20 million meals to homeless shelters last year... 20 million protein-rich meals through their hunting.  That's 20 million meals that the government didn't have to pay for or that a shelter didn't have to get grant or donation money for.  If that's not citizenship, I don't know what is.  God Bless America.
