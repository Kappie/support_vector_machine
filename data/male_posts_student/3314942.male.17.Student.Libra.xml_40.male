Alyssa and Liz(trev's girlfriend) showed up, and we all had a party... Evan and I just repeated the words after the Silent League, basically being really annoying (maga maga maga magazine).....yeah....so Sufjan Stevens was amazing. He has an incredible voice and his songs were well crafted and soothing to listen to...it was the most surreal  concert i have ever been to because everybody was sittting down on teh dock...everybody was...i have never been to a concert where people sat the entire time...but it was lovely...Alyssa and I talked for the whole thing, and it was great to get to know her a little better....this concert was the most hipsterriffic thing i have ever been to....all in all the highlight of the entire concert was when Sufjan, and his band, sang the most beautiful rendition of Star Spangled Banner ever....if it was always sung that way, i would be more proud to sing it...it was really a moving song...  sunkching- v. to hit someone in the head with fingerling banannas.       once the concert finished, we piled into two cabs and got to my car, where i drove all the way CROSS TOWN, and UPTOWN to 116th and broadway, where we had dinner and bubble tea. the bubble tea was good, and so was dinner. so after this it begins to get weird.... weirdest comment of the night: "Its basically abortion" said by Liz to Evan referring to his bubble tea.....  WANTED ASIAN FEMALE ROOM MATE   as well as some other weird things.... so Trev and Liz get on the 1 down to catch their train, adn we head out...as we are trying to get onto the west side highway, i make a turn, and a cop pulls me over saying that it was illegal. i swear by my britches that i turned with a green light, but this cop thought otherwise...he asked for license and registration, asked what i was doing, went to his car, came back gave me everything back asked where i was headed and left...thats it...no ticket or anything...it was so weird, and i was totally weirded out...Evan is convinced that i should buy a lottery ticket because the chances of that ever happening are 1 and a million...oh well, im one in a million waht can i say... so we are driving driving driving down teh west side highway, and get onto the Saw Mill, and the hutch, and my gas light goes on...evan has been warning me constantly about how much gas i had...i left home with a half tank this morning...and now it was on the E...so i decided to pull off at New Rochelle to find a gas station...we drive and drive and drive and drive, we ask a drunk guy and he points us in the right direction.....we get to this gas station, and its closed, but it has a credit card slot, so it should work...it doesnt, we are almost out of gas and it is 11 30....so we drive and drive, and eventually find a mobil station and fill up...but it was weird, because i am normally the most responsible driver...never gets tickets, never runs out of gas, never gets lost...all that changed on the night i needed it not too...its sad...so i was flustered, and Alyssa and Ev calmed me down, and all was good....  in the end, the night was awesome and it was adventurous and an experience. it was one of the best nights this summer just because of the memories i will have from it...im sorry, Evan, if your mom gets mad or stops you from driving with other people....im sorry Alyssa if you came home tooo late and your parents were mad...cest lavie...  ill be lighter than an Oreck vacuum cleaner- Evan  FIREWORKS! Will someone at least say OOOO, AAAA?????????  LOOK! There's ANOTHER cop!- Alyssa as she points to her third taxi  They are all half-asian....  the fates shined and frowned on me today..... oliver
