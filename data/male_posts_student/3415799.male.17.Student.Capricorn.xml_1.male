However then the 'giggling situation' enveloped me as someone pinched me on the bum...yes, on the bum! i'm British so legally i'm allowed to use the word - Arse too, but not ass, thats the name of a donkey-ish looking creature. Anyway, not to stray from my point or anything but i was shocked. I turned around and there was this somewhat fifteen year old girl looking all embarrassed and what not. "it was her..." she said...as if i gave a damn, i was flatterred. However not the point, which is that women can get away with anything, for example if one were to reverse the roles i would have my face slapped and most likely end up in custody. Please ladies, in no way am i sexist, i just don't understand why you get away with what you do, it puzzles me so and it humours me, but i admire you for it. Keep up the good work!
