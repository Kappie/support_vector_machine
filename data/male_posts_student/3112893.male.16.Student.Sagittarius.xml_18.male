I've only bought like 40 DVDs because I've been kinda selective of the movies that I buy. Mostly due to my lack of funds. I felt inspired half-way through The Untouchables to share the list of my favorites with everyone.  Anyway, here's the list of my personal favorites of the ones I own (in no particular order): The Untouchables Reservoir Dogs Pulp Fiction Arlington Road The Big Lebowski Monty Python and the Holy Grail The Nightmare Before Christmas Fists of Fury For a Few Dollars More A Fistful of Dollars The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly The Boondock Saints The Apostle The Wall 2001: A Space Odyssey Don Jaun De Marco Big Fish Grease Ferris Bueller's Day Off The Princess Bride  Here's a list of the movies that I love to watch for the hell of it (sub-great movies included too): Dude, Where's My Car? Animal House Kung Pow! Wayne's World Wayne's World 2 Airplane! (I'd add Airplane 2, but I don't own it) Top Secret! Super Troopers Clerks Mallrats Chasing Amy Dogma Clerks: Uncensored Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back Shrek Zoolander Clueless  Okay, okay, I admit it. So I love almost every movie I've bought >_  Ok, this was pointless. Well, not entirely; everyone knows a bit about my taste in movies now. I guess my work here is done.  That is all. -- Feanor
