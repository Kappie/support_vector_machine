Please, let me explain a little something about Sympatico (my ISP), the service I was given allows me to upload and download 10 GB roughly everymonth. Now, since it's  unlimited  Internet, they're not going to cut your internet off if you keep downloading, but they instead charge you  a lot  every Gigabyte you download/upload over the limit.  Ah, well, fine... I've downloaded too much CSI this month... heh... and I've been online a lot... but I can resist the computer for the next week or so! The next month starts on February 26th so it's not that long... just... seven... days away... -.-* ugh... I just hope my sister wont be Instant Messaging too much on MSN...     I know that for every character I type, I'll be uploading another byte, and downloading it at least twice... but I feel obliged to type what happened on Monday! Too bad I don't remember... -.-  But today... Ugh.. I decided that I should start working... TRYING TO CATCH UP. *tired, yet happy face*  *shrugs* I guess I should leave it at that! All you guys know my number if something important comes up.  -ArV
