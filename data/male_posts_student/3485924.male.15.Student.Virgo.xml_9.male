I'm having too much fun this summer.  I mean, besides the running, the other running, and the running, I can do whatever I want (oh yeah, and besides the summer work for school...).  Yep, I'm pretty psyched (hehe, fun word) about going to Puerto Rico.  I haven't been there for quite some time.  Lemme see... *counts on fingers*  Almost... uh... a year and a half?  Yeah, that sounds right ^^.  Too bad that I didn't get to visit Ricardo when I went last time, but we didn't have time.  Me and my family did lots of stuff (I think?).  Hehe, there are 26 locations in PR that have DDR ^^.  That's only 5 less that in Virginia, and WAY smaller than it.  I'm gonna break Rick's arm if he doesn't let me go.  I'm gonna force him to play too.  Give me one night and he shall be doing 5 footers.  Let's see... what else...  W00t!  I get to wath (yes, WATH) X!  That's gonna be fun.  But first I have to watch it... I hope that doesn't take too long...  Hmm...  I think that's it...  There's really nothing else going on...  Oh, wait!  I finally got my little letter for Cross Country.  It pretty much tells me what I have to do to prepare for it, and also when it starts and all of that boring crap.  On Friday though, I got to try out that little schedule for running.  It's not that bad.  I think that I'll actually be ready for Cross Country when it does start... three weeks before school... at 6:30 AM... >.  Oh well, I'll live.  It's gonna be fun, with Sahil and James and Nick and whoever else is on the team (I'll look at the letter later).  Ok, so I'm out.  Don't worry, in PR I'll be able to update this.  You'll actually get to see "live updates".  Have fun ^_^
