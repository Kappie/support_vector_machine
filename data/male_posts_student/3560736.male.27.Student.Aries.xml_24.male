In this case we're talking specifically about the war in Iraq.  Matt and Colin (and Diane I believe) are all strongly anti-war and their perception is that all the media supports a pro-war stance, and most of America is either in the "with us or against us" stance.  I, on the other hand, support the war. (I will not get into a debate of the reasons pro or con in this post) I perceive the exact opposite. I see people in the media taking pot-shots at the war and trying their level best to paint the worst possible picture of what's going on to force an American withdrawal (Vietnam! Quagmire!). I see almost nothing but anti-war.   Oh, I have sources for finding news and articles that support the war - but none of them come from the major news sources (NYTimes, CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, LATimes, Chicago Tribune, etc.) About the only news source that comes close is Fox news, and they aren't necessarily pro-war (we're talking news here, not pundits - their roles are completely different, one is supposed to have opinions and the other isn't), they're just less anti-war.  So, which is it? Is America pro- or anti-war? How much would you like to wager that the majority of America sees both pro- and anti-war people as extremist nutballs and feel that the war was probably a good thing in the long run but they wish it was over with and hope we can just settle things quickly and get our troops home.   But those aren't the voices we hear. We hear the voices of people who care a little more and want their voice heard. And if they agree with us, we pass over it in a "yea, yea, I know that..." fashion, while when we hear the people who disagree with us we react: "What? How can you be so stupid!" Which reaction will we remember? The one with more emotion involved.   P.S.: I'm not implying in a particular statement above that the American majority doesn't care at all about the war, or even that they care less than vocal minorities. I am saying that they're more willing to let others has it out verbally.
