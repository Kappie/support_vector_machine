But instead I went with my brother Scott and Matt's brother Kyle. We went on almost every ride. I wanted to ride the Dragster (400 feet tall) but it was closed down because it broke and injured 4 people. lol. I don't care, though, if it was open I would still ride it. So now the only two rides I haven't been on at Cedar Point are the Dragster and the Power Tower. My favorite is the Millenium Force cuz you go so fast and it's so smooth. It's  really  fun but the line is  always  at least an hour long, which sucks.
