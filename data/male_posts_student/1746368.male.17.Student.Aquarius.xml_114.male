I think I shall just ramble on until it comes. Well, nothing really to ramble on. By the way, in case you were wondering, my mood hasn't changed on purpose. I am still floating. Maybe I will just make up my own for someone else to copy, then I will put my own there.     Hebrew ::  Llama ::   Achoo ::   Calvin ::  Piano ::  One time use ::  Route ::  CD ::  Boredom ::  Teenage ::    Alright, I am not getting the E-Mail so I will post the actual Mutterings tomorrow. These were not the Mutterings for this week, I repeat these were not the Mutterings for this week. This is only a test, please do not adjust your monitor for any reason. Thank you for your cooperation.
