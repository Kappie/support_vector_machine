I have already taken over the Freemasons, the Skulls and I have converted the former Illuminati to a multinational corporation that produces the Meteor Garden flick.  So, you see, I don't hate F4.  I earn money from them.  Nuff boutta BS.  The truth is, college is so sick, I love to hate it (which is all pure irony considering I don't really hate it.  Uh, never mind).  Anyway, I'm going to have a helluva week next week, all midterms.  Sick-o.  Plus, I'm suffering from inferiority complex, not to mention awe (there I mentioned it) after reading Jessica Zafra's "Twisted 1".  You know, that fat journalist in TODAY's backside?  So, I read it, and wonder, I could do what she writes, except that I have poor vocabulary.  She's so powerful with all her words!!!  I can't read a page that doesn't make me check Mr. Webster from time to time!  And even if I tire taking up that hard lexicon, I can't stop reading!!!!!  Oh my Gollllllly!!!!  So awesome!  I need to do something like that.  You know, through my website.  And yes, I am planning to put up the website that's gathering mold at angelfire.   OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLAAAAAAHH!
