Who knows?        Memories.    I need memories. In order to forget the old ones, I must have new ones to overlay the old. Something to make me forget. Better memories to replace the ones...that I love so much...    Sadly, this is the way it must be. I've mourned my past long enough. I have to start again.                            Sick.
