Never thought I'd ever say that.  Zapitista Nationalista, that's me.   Libre para Todos, Nada para Nosotros.   I went to Park West for dinner.  Finished my project earlier after working on it for two and a half hours today, I really don't like artistic projects.  The Spanish department is a bunch of  putas .  That's about as much spanish as anyone gets to hear me speak.
