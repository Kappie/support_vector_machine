This person would be responsible for making sure the internal processes of the IA are accessible, understandable and workable for people, and to ensure that documents produced by the IA are useful for its Citizens, Associates and Councils (Member Nations).  Now that Mr. Zancer is Lavalon's IA Senator (and given that the Upper House of the IA is not yet very active), I wonder if he would also like to be the Minister of Internal Affairs...  Nate's already the External Affairs minister, and I suspect I will want to appoint Xon to a new Ministry dealing with his planned IA Currency system.  And I'd basically like to ensure Mr. Z has something to do, since he's been so active thus far and I hate to see a willing hand with nothing to do.  :)
