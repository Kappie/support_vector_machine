Save excessive and blatant spilling, there is no alcohol abuse. Sweet little puppies, on the otherhand, arealive and have a moral worth; therefore, if we apply Kantian ethics, sweet little puppies should not  be used simply as a means to an end. Unfortunately, even today, in our 'civilized' society, people are everyday trampling the moral rights of sweet little puppies. A travesty.     So who are these wretched soulswhotake advantage of sweet little puppies?  I will tell you--people who use sweet little puppies to pick upwomen. An Abomination. Lets run through the typical day in the life of a sweet littlepuppy abuser (we'll call him D'Artagnan):   D'Artagnan wakes upandrolls out of the bed of anunknown woman hepicked up at the park on the previous day. He tosses his sleeveless shirt on, grabs the woman's spare change, and proceeds out the door... Oh Crap!... he forgot that  damn puppy. He walks back into the woman's apartment and grabs his puppy (which is cleverly named after a mixed drink) out of the closet he tossed him in last night (without food and toilet)when he got to the apartment.  Come on you stupid mutt. Afterzipping Martini up in his backback, D'Artagnanbriskly jogs home.    D'Artagnan decides that it is time for Martini's daily flogging so he ties Martini up and beats him up a little. Now that the sweet little puppy is tooexhausted from the beating to lash out against hiswicked owner, it is time for D'Artagnan to take Martini to the park. So, after D'Artagnan shaves hischest, trims his sideburns into perfect Z's, and dons his sleeveless t-shirt with a clever phrase on it, man and man's best friend proceed to the park.    'You ready to pick me up some chicks little fella?' Obviously Martini was ready because he neverreceived food unless D'Artagnan scored. So man and sweet little puppy strolled around the park trying the various poses in front of girls:  1) The 'Down on the knees playing in the grass' is a favorite because it conveys a sense of vulnerability on the part of the puppy owner.  2) The 'Teaching the little guy a new trick' is also an effective manuever as it is impossible to not laugh at the failed attempts (doing even more damage to thepuppy's fragile ego).  3) The 'Isn't that funny, the little guys got a red rocket' is second to none because it is not only funny, but it alsoestablishes the penis as an appropriateconversation piece.    Regardless of what move he uses (there are countless others), some girl, not recognizing the scheme, will inevitably fall into the trap; she will end up letting D'Artagnan get away with much more than he deserves because he will use the line, 'you don't want to disappoint the puppy, do you?'   The bottom line is that this has got to stop.Animals are not here simply to allow us to pick up women; everyoneknows that animals are here to entertain us by learning stupid tricks such as roll-over and crap in the toilet clearly not designed for you, as well as serving as the 'guest of honor' at every BBQ...mmm, beef!
