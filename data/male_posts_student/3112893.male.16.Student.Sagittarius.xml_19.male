Here's what it's not: Feener, Feeaner Fayner, Fee-ya-nor, or foogle-google. None of those.  It's not my birthname, but the reason that it's the name I use for everything is: He was the character in The Silmarillion that stood out to me most. This may sound cheesy, but I think that, in a way, he represents what's in all of us as human beings (even though he was an Elf).  If you want to find out more about him, check out this page:  urlLink http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/f/feanor.html   Or you can read the Silmarillion. It's a good read if you're into that whole Tolkien thing.  That is all.         -- Feanor
