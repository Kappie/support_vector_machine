I  will  still do daily Aud-Blog updates so you can listen to me in my virtual paradise tell you whats goin on with 'da shutt.' Im not quite sure if im going to be able to do "written" posts from there, i'll have to see what im allowed to do.   I will see everyone across the street from FJH on Friday. I hope to see you guys there! Its gonna be a great way to end the year with all the crap thats been going on.
