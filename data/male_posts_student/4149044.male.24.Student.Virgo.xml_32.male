I wish Grace had decided to spend the weekend with me rather than making the trip to Houston. Damn fortune teller. Also miss Tay like crazy and wish she'd talk to me. People get confused whenever I say stuff like that, but how can I not miss her? She's my best friend..or at least I thought she was. All I know is that if she were ever feeling as miserable as I am now, I'd be there for her..no matter what. Oh well.
