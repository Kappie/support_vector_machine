NOt to say I'm not sad but she shouldnt have strung me along.  Yo Sobrevivir.  I played bass over at highland avenue tonight which is fun.  I helped steph pack boxes and went to eat with some friends.  I also talked to Laura (Lodine).  I havnt talked to her in a while so i was glad i got to.  She's moving into faulkner saturday so she'll be a lot closer.  We talked for a while, and she told me we could hang out so that'll be good since i havnt seen her in a while......I need to go....peace
