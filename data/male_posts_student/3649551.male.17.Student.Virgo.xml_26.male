My passion is writing fiction and I feel like I should be doing more of it. This being the case, I'm going to pick up some of my other projects at this point in time. I will not abandon this blog by any means: as a matter of fact, I might post pieces from my other projects on here. Up until a few months ago, I never really wrote every day. If I didn't absolutely feel like writing then I didn't. This is not a good system for writing fiction. Luckily I've gotten a lot better about scribbling things daily, so I think I've matured enough as a writer to tackle fiction again. Other than some plans for a novel that have been stagnant for nearly a year now (which I will revive at some point), I've just started a short story. On the surface, it's a story about arrogance, self-righteousness, and honor. Anyway, I think this might work out for the best. If I don't mention anything about what I'm working on, post a comment and see if I'm still keeping at it. If I'm not, call me lazy and worthless. Sometimes I need a little accountability to keep me on track.
