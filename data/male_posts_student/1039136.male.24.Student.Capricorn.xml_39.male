I could go to the top, I could be somebody here"  First of all..thanks to everyone who responded to the last post..let it be the people who read half and immed to ask questions or those who continued to read through and let me know about the tears you shed because of me.  This is the second time i'm writing this post because as we all know, when we have that great entry, we always lose it.  Fucking Life. Lol  Speaking of life...i'm on the verge of another phase. Not a phase as in periodic likes and dislikes, but rather a group of different circumstances, different people and overall a different life.  I got the internship I applied for at a new computer security firm.  Right now I have been given a task of building the technical side of a company ground up, and when I graduate, leading that company to success.  It's a GREAT opportunity..Assuming everything goes as planned. I'll be graduating in May and becoming a Full time computer security engineer. This is a big step..this is it..the REAL WORLD. I've had a taste of it between PA Resources and Windows America, but now this is it..the big time.  This could be my shot at finally making everything i've ever wanted happen. I've worked and fought so hard in life and i'm not about to stop, because maybe it's finally paying off.  Before I do go onto this next phase, i just  wanted to take some time to addess  everyone who was part of my life in any way over the past 5 years.  The past five years have been 5 solid years of learning...learning about technical stuff, learning about life, learning about people... With learning comes pain..and i've had my share of that too. I've gone through so many experiences..i often wonder what people, places, things, ideas, lessons, mistakes, successes and failures i will remember. For one of the first times in my life i'm almost afraid to move on the the next step because i'm afraid i'll forget some important things overall. Whether anything over the past five years has been good or bad, it has all been beautiful..over the last 5 years i've felt more 'alive' than ever.  I always said the purpose of life was just to live...and if thats the case, i've done it well. I haven't always done the right things in the right situations, i havent always made the best decisions, i havent made the worst decisions either, and i havent always done the wrong things in the wrong situations. What will i remember, what will i forget? I'm beginning to believe in fate somewhat, but in the sense that what you do affects your future..even if it's the littlest thing.  Fate perhaps is a map of goals we just cant see, and every single encounter we have from brushing our teeth to relationships, all those things are just little tiny steps..they are the transportation to lead you to your goal.  Will I forget the steps so far...in 6 months, in a year, in 5 years? There isn't much I remember about high school at all..just little things here and there. High school ended a mere seven years ago, and I cant remember most of it..so what of the last five years will I remember..what of the last 2 years? ESU has really been what I needed to learn more about life and people and all that and overall grow up.  I especially want to thank everyone i've met at ESU for the last few years, because they really did a job at defining me. What of it will I remember, I'm going to miss ESU..i'd love to remember more of it than not... But what will my mind choose to keep? will it be the fraternity I was in?  will it be the friends i've made, the girl's i've met? That's something that only the future has an answer for. I am going to live my last year at ESU to the fullest. I'm really going to take in everything and everyone and the whole atmosphere. College is a once in a lifetime thing.  I'm really going to miss it....everything..good..bad..pleasure..pain..all of it has molded my future. It just sucks because i've never had so many people in my life..being those who i know in passing to those i can call blood..and it really is hard because in a few months, there's no way i can possibly keep all of those people in my life.  Saying goodbye to something has never been so hard. I know i'm going to lose a piece of me when this phase is over, but maybe thats exactly what HAS to happen for me to really be ready for the next. I know this isn't a typical post for me if there is such a thing, but i just wanted to take time out to say than you to everyone for the last five years...no matter the person, no matter the circumstance, thanks for being part of my life.  Let's not waste this last year.  If i've had problems with you in the past, oh well..IM me. I dont want to remember anything negative about the people from the last 5 years..if anything i want to remember the good times. So if we've had any problems, still keep in touch this year!!! If we're cool, thats great..don't lose touch! Let's talk..let's hang out..cuz there may never be time for that again!! Let's bullshit, lets bitch about things, ask for some advice.let me help you..i'm not going to have time to do things like this for much longer!  Ya know..I actually like how this rewrite turned out. It's better than the first.   I like how I turned out too..I'm better than the 'first me'. I guess i'm not really afraid of the future..i survived some of the hardest things in the past few years and over all the last 5 years has really not ended badly at all, so for once i have faith in something. I have faith that the future will do the same.  Who would've thought Scarface would have inspired a post like this?!!  I'm closing with my own quote that I used to have for an away... it went something like....  In the future we're gonna look back and talk about the gold ol' days.. Dont forget those good ol' days are now, so make them count.  Much Love -Jdiddy, Oz, Sopp, JS, Stud, T, Killer.... aka John
