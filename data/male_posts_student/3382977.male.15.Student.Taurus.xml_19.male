Most people said that #3 was better than the first two, but i think that they are about the same, or even better in some ways. The first two would switch from scene to scene with not many breaks, which kept the watcher on the edge of the seat, while the third has these funny fade outs and interesting endings of the scene ( mostly with Harry Potter fainting or passing out to make it seem like its supposed to be like that ).   There were also a lot of things put in that made the movie seem a lot different than the book's idea of how it was supposed to go. The main  plots were there but somethings ( like the music that Lupin played ) gave the movie a weird feeling. anyway, you would have to see it for yourself to see what i really mean.  I would go see it. It is a fun and exciting movie. 8 out of 10 is what i would give it.
