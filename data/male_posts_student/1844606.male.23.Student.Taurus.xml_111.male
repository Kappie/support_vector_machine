Gave me some confidence heading into "Exam week." Psych tomorrow, sex on tue. and Ice skating on wed.  Don't know if I can handle the last two...  I also sign up for classes tomorrow.  I'm hoping to engauge in Leisure studies, bowling, drugs use and abuse, "how to be an english major," introductory poetry writing and writing a Senior Thesis...Can you say Senior Schedule?
