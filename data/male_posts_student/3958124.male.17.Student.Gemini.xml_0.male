Jeremy, Paul, Eric and later Siping. With our Super Friends Travis and Chris abroad, we were forced to defeat Mega Stan and Queen Juliet's food of doom.        Jeremy singlehandedly defeated four burgers, three hotdogs and countless chicken wings. Paul overpowered at least ten unsuspecting chicken wings. Noah and I ate a burger and three wings each because we, uh, were saving room for desert. Yeah, thats it. Desert.        Anyway. Moving on to Robbin's Farm, we encountered hordes of pre-pubescent teens trying to fight. We had brought a bag of cherries with us, which for some reason caused some giggly little shits to act like they new us. Damn.        Glowsticks were for sale so naturally I bought two. At dark, we settled on suicide hill until the fire works. We made fun of people and Siping, while kids from our school thought it would be fun to start a shaving cream fight with the six of them. Silly kids, shaving cream is for riots and fun stuff, not the fireworks!        We heard another gaggle of people behind us that we knew wishing they had glowsticks. Every time the would-be-rioters dropped a glowstick, we threw it to the gaggle. This was fun for a while, but it got old. Then, just as we contemplated our swift departure, we noticed a pair of glowsticks caught in a tree. The only option we had was to retrieve those glowing strands of bliss.       Jeremy, Siping, and I set out with sticks and rocks to hurl at the glowsticks while the growing crowd held it's collective breath. After Jeremy threw a root from a small tree he pulled out of the ground, he broke the small plastic connection holding the glowing ring in place. To our surprise, the crowd began to cheer. Then after like three seconds it stopped and we became normal people who no one cared about again.       Other highlights; Jeremy tackling Tom Fitz when Tom was being stupid; Me yelling at some fat, balding  30 year old loser with a laser pointer; and the fireworks ending so we could leave.        Overall a good night, which should end very soon with me falling peacefully asleep in my Air Conditioned room.       BTW: I am the official Word-Smithy; a smith of words. Word-smithies can be poets, authors, play rights, but never George W. Bush's speech writer, or Mr. Woodcock. Stay sat.
