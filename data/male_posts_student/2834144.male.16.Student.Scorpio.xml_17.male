When the boys go to the beach, for instance, Gene remarks that his friend’s skin “radiated a reddish copper glow of tan, his brown hair had been a little bleached by the sun, and I noticed that the tan made his eyes shine with a cool blue-green fire.” Although the language is not expressly homoerotic, Gene’s words suggest that the connection between him and Finny is, if not sexual, then at least strongly physical: the boys direct their affection toward each other’s whole beings, increasing the intensity of their bond."
