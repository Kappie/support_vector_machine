Aside from the fact that it's author likes toast... with a little bit of butter and maybe some jam or preserve or something.  I've got this thing about angels. Well, it's more of a thing with god, but whatever. Anyway, if god is all loving and all giving and infinite and bla bla bla and he created us (humans) for no other reason than to share his love with us, then why did he make angels? I was once told that the reason god creates anything is for only good purposes with no selfish motive. If that's the case, why are angels there? I mean, really, if you only make things to be free and choose whether or not to love you and only to share your love with them, why would you make something thats entire purpose is to serve and worship you.  Another thing, I've got this strange feeling that it's impossible for Lucifer to ever be forgiven of his deeds. My reasons for thinking about this issue is Lucifer should be feeling eternal suffering of the worst sort because he's the second most powerful thing in existence and has gone beyond the bounds of his definition (serving the number one dude (god)). Now we have a reason why Lucifer would want to be forgiven; he doesn't want to feel the worst suffering EVER! Now, here's why I think it's impossible for him to ever be forgiven: If he were ever forgiven, the entire purpose of christianity would be lost; all humanity would be in perfect communion with god by default and there would be nothing to draw them away from the head hancho's "love".  That in itself, to me, is a contradiction of the logic that god is "all loving and caring and forgiving and bla bla bla" because if he were all those great things, why wouldn't he have forgiven ol' Lucy by now? I mean, really, if you had a son who was constantly killing himself just to spite you, but was also asking you to take him back into your house of ultimate love, would you turn away and tell the rest of the family "oh, he's just pure evil. once upon a time he thought he was better than me and I just can't live with the thought of letting him back into my house EVEN THOUGH he feels eternal suffering because of the way I created him. I dunno, it just... it just doesn't feel right." I didn't think you would.  So, with that said, God is not infinite love and therefore God is not infinite and therefore God can be defined as a useful construct created by human perception (which is finite) to help manage their (and others) lifestyles and understand the mysteries of the world around them.  This was not a complete analysis by any means, but it's something to think about while you're on the bus :-).         -- Feanor  P.S.
