Howling and renting of clothes ensues.    Great moments with mothers of childhood friends - Elma, the mother of my friend Mike, kicked her son in the shin, used profanity twice, and let Mike know that "I could still kick your ass" this morning.  When we were six and seven, this woman regularly put the fear of God into me.  Like no one had, or has yet to do again.  Just the mention of the Three Cub Scout Bites causes gagging and loss of bowel control.     Dreams the past few nights both happened in Grand Theft Auto-designed cities.  Last night's was in Galveston; there was some time-share that me and a bunch of friends had, and we were hanging out in the hot tub, but I was supposed to be working on a website with Brian Thomas.  I went to help Brian, but started playing grabass with a few girls downstairs.  Time passed, and I ran into Lauren Jackson, who invited me back to her apartment, but with ten other people.  There I found out that my grabass stopped me from seeing her in a bikini.  And I was upset.    I woke up this morning with that dream full in mind, remembering specific sequences and events.  Immediately, I wanted to grab a pen, write it down, pull a Leonard Shelby.  But the couch I was on was comfy, lived-in (probably fornicated on, but I can ignore that), and too soft to move from.  I switched on Sportscenter, and now, hours later, all I have is that dillapidated (and poorly spelled) account of what was an envigorating dream.  Damn you, blogger, for requiring a logon prompt and internet access!
