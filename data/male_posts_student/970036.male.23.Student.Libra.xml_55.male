During the summer, as I was getting ready to start making a few payments, I was informed that the provincial government had paid off my  entire  outstanding balance with Edulinx, a debt load of nearly  $7000!  I made sure to get a conformation of that in writing, as I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I hadn't applied for any special debt relief, and I'm not even finished with school yet - I was simply taking a year off.  Then this month I get a statement from Royal Bank, who holds the other half of my student loans. Once again, the provincial government, seemingly out of the blue, has seen fit to pay nearly  $5000  off my loans! I don't know what the hell is going on, but I'm sure not complaining about it.  Who knows, if I stay in University long enough they might just clear up  all  my debts!     Currently: Shaking and mumbling from not having gone to bed yet.
