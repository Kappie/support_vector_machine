     
      For the second time in a week, I've declined to go to a show due to excessively high ticket prices.  I like Rush, but considering I saw them twice two years ago at $65 a pop, a ticket for one show over $100 isn't going to fly.   I've been listening to Dylan so much, I'm growning a fro and sluring words.   My hand is shaved and I'm ready to be infused.
