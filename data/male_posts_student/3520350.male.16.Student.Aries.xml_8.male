With him its fun, and we don't even have any book-related homework. He said that he has to give them out to us becaus of department rules, but nowhere in those rules does it say that he has to make us carry them back and forth each and every day, or for that matter use them in calss. He gave them out, wrote down our book numberes, and we stached them right back in the pile in the classroom. More teachers should do this. Here it is clear that he knows the subject. If he didn't, he'd not risk by not giving us books. This is nice, as now there's no need for a backpack - just a binder and a pen. The class, "Government", seems fun, and we allready had two debates, both showing off Bush's incompetence - I could get used to this :-D. Hopefully this will continue to be this fun.
