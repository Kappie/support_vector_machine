Even though there's no damn finals, there was that English project. Boy was I glad to get that pile of crap, er, creative crap out of my hands in English today. What a relief.  Well, since I missed yesterday, here's the belated daily Spanish funny: As all of us guys in the corner prepare to drop our books on the floor simultaniously, Anton develops a habit of looking at the clock too much. Mrs. Sustic: "Anton, why are you looking at the clock so much?" Anton: "Uhhh..." Derrick: "Because this is boring!" *Derrick gets his desk moved to hall location for remainder of period.* Just for background information's sake, Derrick has a habit of getting "punished", as in having to face the board or go in the hall when he says the class is boring.   In other news, I humbly recieved a perfect score on that Social test...haha to all who didn't! lol, j/k  Hey-I think that I might actually have a life this weekend. *oooh...ahhhh...* That is, if getting up at 6, going to a robotics tourney on Saturday, then going to a Darksteel prerelease for Magic on Sunday counts. I don't know.  As for the week being a bitch: 1. Had to move piano lesson from Tuesday to Wednesday due to amount of homework (cough...English). 2. Had Jazz Band and piano lesson on Wednesday, plus homework. 3. Had robotics practice on Thursday along with playing jazz band at the open house. I was fasionably late too-*drummer dashes in to the Great Hall, band immediately starts playing when he reaches the set* 4. Choir on Friday. Hopefully no homework for weekend, as it will be full. 5. Blah, blah, blah. So on, and so fourth.  Getting tired, as usually. So that means the end of this blog entry.  Later, Bren  "Cause’ it feels like summer again I was thinking that it just might never begin After winter and spring It’s good to have the sun on my face again"
