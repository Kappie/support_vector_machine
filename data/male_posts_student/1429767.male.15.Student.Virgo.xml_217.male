Today was pretty boring for the most part I woke up super late, around 2 or so. By the time I got out of the shower and shaved it was 2:30 so I pretty much wasted my day, I was supposed to mow today for Jeanne but it looked like rain all day and I didn’t want to get caught in the rain mowing, its not very fun! So that’s on my list tomorrow. I think I might actually clean my basement tomorrow too, it’s pretty bad! I’ll have to show you on cam or something if you want… I watched the movie Monster today, it was an awesome movie. I had to finish it after I caught 10 minutes of it with my parents so I brought it downstairs and popped it in, let me tell you WOW that was a really good movie! It’s about this hooker that gets raped and becomes a serial killer with this other girl that is gay and they fall in love. Towards the end I cried, yeah big surprise! It was really sad at the end you must see it! If you want to borrow it just hit me up and I’ll let you borrow it. I still need to watch The Last Samurai and Cold Mountain before week’s end so that way I’m caught up on all of the new movies my mom has bought in the past months. My allergies are killing me yet again, but I looked on the calendar today and I only have a week left until I see Dr. McTigue about getting something to take care of them. At least I have nasal drainage now, before it just ran out the front and nothing could drain in the back so that’s a good thing. I didn’t really sleep last night until about 8 this morning so that’s probably why I slept so late and all, I just kept sneezing and my sinuses were killing me so I couldn’t get comfortable the whole time I lied there. Eventually though I fell fast asleep and it felt great! Well I’m starting AIM and Yahoo so I better go before I get too swamped and forget to publish… Oh and one more thing, if you get a chance pick up the Something Corporate CD it’s soft but a very good listen!
