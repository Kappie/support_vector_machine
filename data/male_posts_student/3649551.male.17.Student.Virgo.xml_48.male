I really enjoy apologetics (basically looking at Christianity in a philosophical and logical light), but God is not something we're supposed to understand. In reality, the human mind can barely wrap itself around the idea that such a being exists. I'm not talking about theorizing and reasoning about God, I'm talking about actually understanding him. We can't. We have these irritatingly little minds. I just don't appreciate it when people sell a belief system. I mean, an advertisement for how well you know God? Come on: how very televangelist. Some people don't realize that when you sell your beliefs like that, you just come off as false and you destroy your chance to make someone understand what you're really trying to say. Forget talking about it, live it. That's how you advertise what you believe: by what you do, not by the bullshit you throw out in fancy religious talk. I don't know how many people read this stuff, but it's probably not very many. I couldn't care less. I write this crap for myself - I'm not trying to prove anything to anybody. So when I talk about my religion on here, you can bet that I'm being genuine. I've already admitted that I don't live out my beliefs enough. I'm disgusted with myself in that respect. At least I'm honest about it. I can't stand greasy-haired televangelists who make profits off Christ. They also give Christianity a bad name. But then again, so do Christians. My God, forgive our failures! We are such bad representation!
