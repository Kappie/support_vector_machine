I find myself (espically now) missing home more than every.  I am looking forward to everything about home.  Seeing Meeta =), friends, room, BED!!, lol...but truly I do miss all of you and truly want to get back there.  Espically someone =)...  But so far I have seen like 5 or 6 castles and today we went to the Royal Palace where the Queen lives when she is in Scotland...really cool and she lives a damn nice life!!  Loch Ness was really cool although I did miss out on the monster lol.  Been to numerous cathedrals and churches (at the least 10) and all of them are totally breathtaking...the time these people took to build these things is very impressing.  All the major sites in London ive seen and yeah...just really cool cause its stuff you wont see anywhere else (culturaly wise)  There is truly nothing more strange than drving on the LEFT side of the road!! lol  Stonehenge was very impressing and mysterious all at the same time.  Prolly one of my more favourite sites (thats how they spell favorite lol)  Yeah, the culture is really weird and a lot different that the U.S.  Oh yes, the tour group....so we got on the tour bus on the 14th and yeah, I only knew my 5 other family memebers that were with me.  But no more than 20 mins after we got on the bus we find out that like 10 people on it are from Texas and 4 of them live in Cat Hollow!!  Fricking weird if you ask me.  I mean what are the possibilities of that...  So yeah, when I get back I am making a whole new blog just about this trip with pictures and yah...should be really cool...Ive takin over 400 pictures and will have over 700 by the end of the trip so it should be full of picutres...Looking forward to making it.  Alright well Im gonna go and get off to my Scottish evening which looks pretty cool.  I miss all of yall a lot and look forward to getting home (less than a week!!!)  and this goes out to a person that should know who she is...  I miss you so much and cant wait to see you when I get back...sorry i cant call as much as I would like...the time difference sucks.  I miss you so much and love everything about you...will see you when i get home...  alright...lata days...  england just isnt the same without you here....
