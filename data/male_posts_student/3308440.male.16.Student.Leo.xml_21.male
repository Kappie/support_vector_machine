I'm fine thanks   The past couple of days have been a bit boring as I have no exams or it's the weekend but still I seemed unsettled I cannot concentrate one one thing for long or I just do not get started on doing something it's damn wierd.  Ah well, today is the start of the football tournament  Euro 2004 with these fixtures today:   Portugal v Greece 1 (0)    v    2 (1)  Spain v Russia 1 (0) v   0 (0)  I will try and get updates on these matches when possible, thats about it for now.  See ya  Dan :)  Current mood: Relaxed  Current music: U2 - "40"
