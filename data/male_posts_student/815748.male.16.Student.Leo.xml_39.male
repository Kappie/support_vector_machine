All of the amendments I voted for also passed.  As you all know, I, John Garabedian, Richie, Loren, and others went to New York City.  I noticed there were many "I Love NY" T-shirts and mugs, but few "I don't particularly care for NY" ones, even in New Jersey (in Hoboken, land of the Hoboes).  I agree with Richie's analysis of the city, an "urban wasteland."  The Cloisters wasn't too interesting, but "Rent" was pretty gouda�� no Star Trek X, mind you.  The wax museum was mildly entertaining, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art was good, except that we didn't have enough time to admire the paintings, and I didn't recognize anything from "Don't Eat the Pictures!"  The Hard Rock Cafe was disappointingly bad, even though I'd been there before.  Overall, it was a bland, smelly odyssey of the nose.  X2 was definitely worth seeing, as I'm sure Matrix Reloaded will be.  Oh, and I got a 100% on my history test (Reformation).  Sit on that, Arthur Fonzarelli (Who's Jewish, by the way).  I must add DIE ALL NON-CARD, NON-MAELSTROM COMPUTER GAMES!!! THAT MEANS YOU, WARCRAFT!!!  The faux MCAS was kind of confusing, I don't think I did as well as last year, but of course it counts for naught.  I'll close on this quote from one of the world's wisest philosophers:  Harry Truman, Doris Day, Red China, Johnnie Ray South Pacific, Walter Winchell, Joe DiMaggio Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe  Rosenbergs, H-bomb, Sugar Ray, Panmunjom Brando, "The King and I" and "The Catcher in the Rye" Eisenhower, vaccine, England's got a new queen Marciano, Liberace, Santayana goodbye  We didn't start the fire It was always burning since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No we didn't light it but we tried to fight it  Joseph Stalin, Malenkov, Nasser and Prokofiev Rockefeller, Campanella, Communist Bloc Roy Cohn, Juan Peron, Toscanini, dacron Dien Bien Phu falls, "Rock Around the Clock"  Einstein, James Dean, Brooklyn's got a winning team Davy Crockett, Peter Pan, Elvis Presley, Disneyland Bardot, Budapest, Alabama, Krushchev Princess Grace, "Peyton Place", trouble in the Suez  We didn't start the fire It was always burning since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No we didn't light it but we tried to fight it  Little Rock, Pasternak, Mickey Mantle, Kerouac Sputnik, Chou En-Lai, "Bridge on the River Kwai" Lebanon, Charles de Gaulle, California baseball Starkweather, homicide, children of thalidomide  Buddy Holly, "Ben Hur", space monkey, Mafia Hula hoops, Castro, Edsel is a no-go U-2, Syngman Rhee, payola and Kennedy Chubby Checker, "Psycho", Belgians in the Congo  We didn't start the fire It was always burning since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No we didn't light it but we tried to fight it  Hemingway, Eichmann, "Stranger in a Strange Land" Dylan, Berlin, Bay of Pigs invasion "Lawrence of Arabia", British Beatlemania Ole Miss, John Glenn, Liston beats Patterson Pope Paul, Malcolm X, British politician sex JFK, blown away, what else do I have to say  We didn't start the fire It was always burning since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No we didn't light it but we tried to fight it  Birth control, Ho Chi Minh, Richard Nixon back again Moonshot, Woodstock, Watergate, punk rock Begin, Reagan, Palestine, terror on the airline Ayatollah's in Iran, Russians in Afghanistan  "Wheel of Fortune", Sally Ride, heavy metal, suicide Foreign debts, homeless vets, AIDS, crack, Bernie Goetz Hypodermics on the shores, China's under martial law Rock and roller cola wars, I can't take it anymore  We didn't start the fire It was always burning since the world's been turning We didn't start the fire No we didn't light it but we tried to fight it  We didn't start the fire But when we are gone will it still burn on, and on, and on, and on..
