I can't wait for November.    Is it just me, or do you see it too?  When Howard Dean starts speaking, he looks like a normal, mild-mannered man.  Then, as he rolls along, I see visions of Bruce Banner...shirt splitting, skin turning green, muscles bulging, as Dean descends into grunts of "Dean SMASH!!" as he pounds the podium into wood splinters.    It would make a good SNL parody.
