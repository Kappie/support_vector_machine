I hate to pack, so when the time comes, and I simply can't say "oh, I'll do it tomorrow" then I usually just get a few of my most important belongings and chuck them into a handbag. The only thing I'm worrying about is (because that of course is my style) the pirated DVDs and Audio albums I have. Will they stop me at the airport? Nah, I simply can't imagine that. Here are the following reasons:  -The X-Ray machines are only meant to search the bags for weapons and harmful objects that might cause accidents or might be used to cause damage.  -Even if they noticed 200 disks, and thought it was unusual, it's none of their business, after all, they are not there to check if I payed the taxes on them, or just copied them.  -They are really good quality copies, perfectly printed colourful covers which are just like the original ones, and labelled disks aswell..so its hard to tell if they really ARE fake.  Yea, so you might ask, "what if they do find out that they are pirated? What then?" Well, you know what I1ll say? I'll say I didn't know and that I got tricked over, nice lie, ey?...yea..(not)    This post kinda relates to the previous one for the reason that I was talking about how good it is to pirate things, well, maybe not always. Nevermind, I think this is my past post from Indonesia, I'll write to you guys when I get back to Hungary (yeaaa!).  I also wanted to share something strange with u guys, I have noticed that when I am a bit more than tipsy I start just staring at things, this quite funny actually when you see some photos of me and see the similarities.    Well I hope u enjoyed this post, I'm exhausted but I tired to make u smile. Have fun whatever you are doing in the summer, oh yea, and READ MY BLOG! :D
