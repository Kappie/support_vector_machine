First, I was interviewed by the Exco for being in the committee. Hmm. I did suckily. Not my usual standards, I am afraid. Oh well.  Hmm. There wasn't any real practice session. They spilt up into 4 groups of 10. These are the groups for the choir camp. I rather like my group. Yeah. Got Faizal, David, Boon Chai, Dorothy, Serene, BiXia, Alicia, YunYi and Yvonne. HaHa! I remembered my members' names. Bo liao right? :P Anyhoo, we played games all day long and we had fun. Yep.    TODAY   We took the class photo today. O.o! What meowing fun!   Ayiah...I no mood to write about today la! I am very excited. In Professor Sun's class, I am participating in this Time Race. Prof Sun will post questions every Tuesday, America's time. I would aways see the questions in Wed night my time, and our group are always not as early to send in our answers, thus we are denied of any galleons. Today, I finally saw the questions first!! FIRST! I quickly did the quiz and sent it to our captain, who hopefully woke up already, would log on and send the answers over to Prof. Quick Quick! We have to win some galleons this week!! She hasn't woken up yet!! QUICK!!!  Er-hmm! I am too excited le la...and too tired. HaHa! I think I go sleep le. See ya next time. Night blog. TaTa!
