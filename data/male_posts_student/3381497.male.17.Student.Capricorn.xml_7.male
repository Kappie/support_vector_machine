It's probably my most listened to album for the past week. If you like bands like As I Lay Dying or Atreyu or metalcore in general, you'll love Unearth. It's suprising I still haven't gotten the new Atreyu or Underoath yet and those two were probably my most anticpated releases of the summer. They're only $9.99 @ Target, so I really hope I get them soon, and hope they got enough so they're not sold out.  Now I'd like to announce that I passed my AP Eng Lang Exam. Woo woo! It was only a 3, but hey passing is passing when it come to AP exams, right? It sucks I only had a 2 in Psych though, Damn Aquino! haha. It's cool though, atleast I passed one. Now maybe I could negotiate for a higher grade in the class. haha. I got a D in Eng, and getting that up to a C would be alot of help.  I watched an Afghan movie today called Osama(which was really good) for my summer assignment for AP Eng Lit. I just need to see a couple more movies and read a book I haven't even gotten yet. I hope to get it soon though. I know I could finish it pretty fast concidering I really have nothing better to do, but just in case.  For the past few months, I've really been concidering becoming atheist or agnostic or whatever, but concidering that my family has a pretty much very religious, Catholicbackground it's kind of scary to just do it. I already get criticized enough for not going to church and not participating in a lot of religious traditions and stuff. I might have to go in exhile or something. I'm probably the most unreligious person in my extended family from everyone I can think of. They want me to get involved and stuff, but I just don't see me doing it. Another thing that holds me back is that, I think I still believe in god sometimes.  And for the past couple of weeks, the vegetarian subject comes up again. Why did meat have to be so good?  I really have too many conflicts in my head recently. It's like a warzone in there, and there doesn't seem to be any end to it. Sometimes the only answer seems tobe another Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but I'vedecided about a year ago thatgoing kamikaze isn't gonna help anything and there's just too much I want to do before I can go.
