Anyways, so I had the house all to myself for a couple of hours which I spent on  taking a shower and tryingto finish up Dracula. Unfortunately, I had to  put it down one chapter before the end. Around 2 o'clock my mom and grandma, or  Jojo, as I know her came back with some Pizza-hut. I gobbled down a pepperoni  and 2 cheese slices and got ready to go to work. I had to be at work by four but  since I don't have a car I had to hitch a ride with Jojo on her way to her home  in Conroe.       I said bye to everyone, and left  with my Grandma for work...that makes me feel so grown up saying that. Anyways,  on my way there we talked about the Da Vinci Code, which I made her get addicted  to, and also talked about the 7 DVD set of WWII films I bought yesterday(  yesterday in an infomercial came up a 2-DVD set of WWII films for the low, low  price of 29.95, so I called TimeLife to buy them, but the Indian guy who was  reading from apparently a booklet or cheatsheet of some sort, told me about a  special of 7 DVD's for 4 EASY, AND CHEAP PAYMENTS OF 24.95 EACH...I loved the  deal and immediately fell in. But come on 7 fucking DVD's of rare wwii  footage!!!ehhh...ehhh.). My step-grandfather was in world war ii, Korea, and  Vietnam so he's a military man himself as he finished up his career as a colonel  and went to work in the Pentagon, so it interested her deeply.       Once I got to the Woodlands  Mall, I work in a store called Freestyles, I saw that in my watch it said 2:25  so I went to the new Barnes and Noble and sat determined to kill time until 4  o'clock. I drank a Venti Cappuccino and finished off Dracula (so fucking  great!!!!) and finished my time magazine cover issue on Clinton. I was very  impressed with Clinton and in fact so impressed that I felt inclined to pay 25  dollars for his book...yeah I know, but I had to....don't judge me!!!....it was  four so I went upstairs to Beyond Image to see if theKatie, the  girlI had a crush on, was there, she wasn't. It pisses me off  becauseI haven't seen her in weeks!!      After I had finished mourning I  went to work, where Emily invited me to a party on fourth of July to celebrate  her new home. I'm not much of a party person but I think I'll go.then just let  the rest of the day pass by. A girl who has this huge crush on Michael came by,  her name is Rachel, and started a conversation with him. Now I like Rachel (not  in that way), so I pick on her, she's a pretty girl with a great smile ,  pink-highlighted hair, and for some fucked up reason likes the spice girls,  shejust graduated high school and is going to move to Austin, making it  the main reason why Michael doesn't want to become involved with her. So as I  said, I pick on her and she got a little frustrated, so I stopped and didn't  move from the place I had been standing for about 5 minutes. Her phone rang and  she took it somewhere so she wouldn't be bothered. When she comes back she  grabbed Michael and started whispering to him 2 feet away from me!! When I  looked at her she yelled at me, "Oscar, why are you always in my fucking  business, seriously you're starting to get on my fucking nerves!" I didn't know  what I did wrong. Apparently she had been called by her mom and had been pissed  off..whatever.      Later on Rachel(diff. one, she  has short blond hair and is gay) from Beyond Image came by looking for plugs,  while showing her I sneaked in the question, "I haven't seen Katie for a while,  does she still work there?" Katie had found a second job working at the Sonic at  Louetta and Ella, but even Rachel didn't know what was going on with her, for  apparently she hadn't been in for a while...damn it!!     Ataround7:30Daniel Mendoza came  by, again from Beyond Image, and him and I went to get food from the Food Court.  Oh yeah, Daniel got his nose pierced on the side, and doesn't look that bad. I  was playing around with him and I accidentally hit him on his nose and hurt him.  At the food court we split, he went to Wendy's while I went to Chick-Fil-A. he  finished before me and we started talking to the girls that work at Chick, and  during our conversation one of the girls asked him how big his plugs were and  when Daniel went to grab his ear he accidentally knocked over all the freaking  brownies from their display. They all laughed about it so it was  cool.     Approximately at8:30  these two kids wanted a board and grip tape, I sold them a board and told them  to get it gripped at Beyond Image because it would be cheaper and sent them a  little message to Daniel telling him to grip it. 5 minutes later these kids come  back and give me the board and grip tape and it has a note that says, "Here you  can grip tape it you fag." So I went down there and told him off jokingly and  went back defeated to grip the board.      After work Michael dropped me  off at home and I ate some left over pizza from the day and read Harry Potter  for a bit. I put Harry Potter down after a couple of chapters and began "Angels  and Demons" by Dan Brown, the same guy who wrote the Da Vinci Code, I hear this  one is good so I read a little bit of that. Then I sat down and wrote this for  about half and hour... great, I have nothing better to do. Because of that I  shall retire for the night, so until I write again I bid  you...goodnight!
