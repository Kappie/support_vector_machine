HaHaHa.   We met at 10am.... ha ha ha! Only me, SuPing, Gloria and CQ came there early. The rest were all late. We waited till 10.30 or so before we can finally go play bball.   We played and played till about 12.30 lor. Some interesting things happened. My toenail got chipped after i smashed my toe into XC's sandals. A girl from Marsiling Secondary joined us, presumably after getting her N Level results. SuPing left mid-game to go to her job interview.   Hm...me, SQ, Hann, CQ and XC went to a nearby foodcourt to eat. WQ went back to his house and Gloria followed Joyce to her house to eat. I ate the what, main fen guo. Ha. Not as good at 768's. HaHa. (Even though they added stupid garnishes once. Idiots!)  AFter lunch, we went back to the bball court to wait for everycat to gather. We started playign ABC. HaHa! All I can say is: I made major impovements. I graduated till the middle of the court le. Last time, the furtherest I can go is the 'B' line. HaHa! Soon, everybody gathered and we played bball lor. WE played till there's a downpour and we had to shelter.  WE suggested going to WQ's house to play. HaHa. Everybody went up to his house, despiste the reluctance of WQ's. We went there, cleaned our hands and feet and played la. We mainly played poker cards. We played BlackJack, Heart Attack and Murderer. Murderer is so fun! At the last round, I pretended to be the Medic and 'save' CQ. It turns out that he's the medic! HaHa! So fun to confuse cats.   Me, Gloria and Joyce went back first. Me and Gloria walked all the way to Causeway Point to take the 913 bus home. HaHa. The ground was so dirty...my feet were stuck with sand particles. Eee...so uncomfortable.   I came back, bathed, ate dinner and watched TV. I felt kinda feverish also. HaHa. I watched "Everybody Wins". HaHa. Quite funny la. Ehh! Next week's episode got Bao Mei Li. Must watch ar!!  HMm....I am going to CHC tomorrow for the HYS concert. Ah...it would be an enriching experience, cause I haven't been there for about 1++ years. Ha...see what's changed lor. I am also going there to have fun with Hann and XiaoXi. HaHa.  Hmm...sigh. It looks like I am always getting an arugment with WQ. My blog is biased, by the way. Because it contains what I thinks. Duhz. It's MY blog. It is supposed to be biased. Some people need to think more before saying a statement. Sigh.....moo meow meow.   Okay.I think I go liao la. Gotta go le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
