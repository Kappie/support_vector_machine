Today he was like "I dont think one lap really warms you up, do you guys? From now on we will be running a MILEto warmup!" I was like dude you are fucking gay. We had to run it in 7 minutos and 30 seconds. Which thankfully I did with a few to spare. But then like 10 people finished after the alotted time and only some of them would fess up to it. So he tried to make us all run it again in 6:30 but he just started yelling and told us to go strech. We proceeded to actually go play soccer which was sort of fun but all we did was drills.
