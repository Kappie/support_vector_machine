I then played DDR against a senior I know. I only lost by 50000 points. We then went bowling. I am a terrible bowler. I only won by 7 points, and I only had 72. We then went out for pizza and ice cream. I twisted my ankle walking across the street, and it still hurts. Unfotunately, I had to work today. It was really easy, but it was, as usual, pretty boring, especially when I have Alyce's Xbox here waiting for me. I guess that's all I got, so I'll leave all y'all alone for the day. See you, space samurai.
