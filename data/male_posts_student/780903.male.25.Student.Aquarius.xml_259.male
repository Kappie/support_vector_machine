It certainly can't hurt -- the more practice, the better.  And hopefully the feedback will provide some sense of what a professor is looking for in an answer to an exam question.  Other than that, it's cold in Boston.  But I expect that will be the case for a few months now...  Five Signs That It's Cold Outside 1. The pile of snow is wearing a winter coat.  2. Instead of hot dogs, street vendors are selling gloves. 3. Santa Claus is wandering around looking very lost.  And shivering. 4. Mugger: "Your money... or your hat." 5. You don't notice that the bowl of hot soup you're eating is actually a bowl of ice cream.
