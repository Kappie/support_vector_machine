It made me think back in the day when we all used to be friends, the whole class were friends with each other except for the few that were outcasts I guess you could say. It was great times we all would hang out at recess and have all kinds of clubs and such that really didn't do anything. We all could relate but then Pat Ham days came along and ripped us all apart, it was odd to go back to school and not see all of your old friends in your class as past years. At first I wanted to be with everyone again, I wanted to spend all of my class time with them but then I got used to it and made new friends and lost others in the process. I still miss talking to some of them, others I could care less, but the friend I talked to was Jackie and I always remember being good friends with her. She was really cool we used to swing all the time, I did that a lot, I would hang out with the girls on the swings rather than going and playing whatever the boys did. So I guess you could say I even knew subconciously back then that I was gay, and Jackie if you happen to read this , consider this me telling you... I don't remember having feelings for the guys or anything then, in fact I had a crush on Amy not any guys... It was weird I got along with the girls so much better then and I still do. Anyway... I more than likely wont sleep for yet another night, I'm still in amazement about Saturday and it's still just all wow to me right now. Plus Krissy is going to call me tomorrow from the Simple Plan show on another Warped show and try and get Chuck on again so with that to look forward to I just don't see how I will sleep... I drank a whole 2 liter of Mountain Dew today too, so that's not going to help with the sleep issue. You know what? I don't care because rumor has it, there's a meteor shower tonight at 4 am and I wouldn't miss it for the life of me. I love the night skies, I could look at them for the rest of my life with my true love beside me and never have a complaint in the world. It would be amazing... Stars are just so amazing, you could take everything away from me but the stars and I would be just as happy, well I would miss Simple Plan... Well I think there's a 40 page paper on "Prophecies Unfulfilled in the Bible" that's calling my name... This good stuff, really it is.
