I'm having a bit of problems with the template. I am trying to make my banner (Similar to this picture) fit at the spot where you see the title of the blog. Tried a bit with my mother(She knows html) and it did'nt work. I will check a bit more on Blogger or maybe Google it after. If anyone has some information as for the code to input an image from an url to the title, please comment this post!   Also i have been messing with the Jumper Editor 2.2. I made two quick new maps. One is easy and fast and the other require some quick thinking. It's a zip file accessible from this url   Static Galore(253Ko) + Weak Minded(250Ko)   http://www.geocities.com/darksurfaceteam/jumpercustomzephyr1.zip  If the link is dead/Broken, try it a bit later...  Some Infos on how to play custom levels on Jumper:  1.Open Jumper editor. (You can get it from the url provided in the Interaction With A Jumper post) 2.Select load map from the built-in menu. 3.Get the file from where you unzipped it. 4.Press Play. 5.Voila!    The process of doing custom maps is pretty similar. If anyone who read this decide to make new maps, you can send them to me at fulgor28@hotmail.com . I will be happy to play them. I will also publish the best custom maps on a ulterior posts. So check soon. Anyway i'll be making more soon enough.  Regards,  Zephyr
