One website will be for the Computer Science Club that I'll be co-president of next year (Current site:  urlLink http://hpcompsciclub.tripod.com/ ); the other site will be for the Final Fantasy XI clan that I've become a co-leader of (Current site:  urlLink http://foxknights.tripod.com/ ). I designed both of the current sites, but I want to be able to do things that free hosts won't allow (PHP scripting, custom email addresses, etc.). Maybe I'll even migrate this blog to a subdomain to one of them to make image hosting easier.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to do a bunch of the things that I want to do with the websites. That's the stuff I'll be learning in Indeoendent Study this next year, but until then, neither are going to be all that different from what they look like right now. Maybe I'll start learning a few things before school starts; it'd at least give me something to do when I get bored.
