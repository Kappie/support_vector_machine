Did some in the morning, some after work, and some late last night. I love it too, doesn't look so plain anymore.  I got my hair cut today. Short and streaked blonde. My head is now able to breath. But I miss all the hair I had. :P  Other than all of that intriguing information, I do have some bad news that is disappointing to me. My trip to Winnipeg is now off. My friend doesn't have the money to cover it as her check was smaller than she expected, so she had to cancel to hotel reservations and what not. It was kind of a kick in the ass because I really wanted to go, but shit happens to I guess I will have to deal with it.   I packed some of my room last night, half of it is in several boxes, laying all over the place. Moving isn't pretty, especially when you discover things from about 5 years ago all around your room, that you forgot about. I am not one to adapt to change very easily, so moving is going to be hard. I love the current house I am living in, and I like the one we are moving into, but, even though this one is smaller and what not, I am so used to it and I am not used to the other one. I know that within a month I will get over my old house and settle in, but the transition period inbetween is something I hate enduring. Even though I know it will come out positive, it's that little period that bothers me.  Tonight a few of us from work are going to see Lisa and her baby. She brought it into work yesterday; it was adorable. Afterwards Nadine  I, and I don't know who else, are going to Berries for "smoke-free" coffee. Should be a good first day of work holidays.  It's so hot out today, I walked to Terra Nova (Hairstylist place) and back and I worked up a massive sweat. I love it though, because at least it feels like summer now. It's current 27 C, with a humidex of 32 C. Good temperature, for up here anyway :P  Well, Nae  I are heading to McDonalds soon, I will post later  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Take it easy all.
