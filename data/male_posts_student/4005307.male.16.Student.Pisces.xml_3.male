(baked beans too)  Then we went to Brighton to participate in the conference before running off to see more stone circles (could not find them), a castle (which is closed on Saturdays) and finally Chitchester Cathedral.   We returned to Brighton for the closing celebrations and heard pipers and a choir from Kenya......pretty cool, and also a singer.....yawn.  Anyway, we are off on Sunday to a paintball tourney.  We did swing by one field today and met a famous guy who used to play on a famous team.....he thought quite highly of himself.  Jake is honing his accent.    D and J
