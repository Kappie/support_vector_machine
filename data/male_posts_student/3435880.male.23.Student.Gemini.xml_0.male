I'm not too far into this one yet as the demands of my academic life have swelled beyond the banks of normality and are currently washing away the homes of the people of "Fun-ville" i.e. the majority of my brain. Usually I'm content to sit back, do the minimum and come out on top at the last second... most of the time that is. But now I have been forced to take a pro-active role in my schooling as the level of work has been bumped up not one, but 3 billion notches. I know that you're probably thinking "That's a lot of fucking notches" but I assure you that in the world of Rhino, the notch that measures productivity are as milliseconds are to a day. That's still 34.72 days folks. So it's not as much as my standard work unit might make it seem, but it's still a lot.   I know I've been bitter about school and the work involved, but I'm still psyched. I'm so fucking close right now, I can feel the cramp of my future cubicle and the pressure that will eventually cause me to boil over and k... um... maybe we should leave it at that.. This is your frienly neighborhood Rhino signing off... R
