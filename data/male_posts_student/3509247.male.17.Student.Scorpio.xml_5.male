This week has been yet another week of work, boredom, fun, and, yes, pain.  Monday and Tuesday of this week, I didn't work because the people at work were too busy for me (I guess they had too many people coming in).  Not only was I off, but it was also raining so I couldn't enjoy the day.  I was stuck inside on my computer.  Now because this happened two days in a row I got restricted to 4 hrs a day on my cpu.  That + talking to friends + blog + everything else I have to do online can't be done in 4 hrs. so it may take me a while to update (sorry).  Absolutely nothing happened those two days; so I didn't post anything.  Wednesday, I worked and something good happened.  They didn't make me take a break that day.  Something bad happened also.  They made me clock out 45 mins early (which means I got an early extended break tacked on the end).  After not working two days in a row, that was a death nail.  Fortunately Thursday I got some extra time tacked on the end of my day.  At the end of that day, I worked a little with my cousin Seth running for him in drive through. (that means I was getting the food for him)  The only thing is I was helping him off the clock because I was waiting for my Aunt to take me home (Seth's Mom actually).  Anyways, I gained valuable running skills by helping him so it wasn't a total loss.  On another bright side, one of the managers told this extremely annoying girl (Melinda, I don't know if I told ya'll about that or not) to go home and not come back the next day because of something bad she did.  Because she couldn't come in, I got to take her place for the next day.  Working makes me happy :)!!!  Friday was quite a day.  I came in at 8 instead of the normal 7 wich was so weird.  I was working and doin my thing and I saw an old schoolmate, Joshua Wiloughby.  He told me he was in Military school (Boot Camp, lol) and was going to graduate the same year as me.  Anyways, I had many other interesting customers that day too.  One of them, Claudia had (I can't remember if it was Friday or Thursday that this one came through) (Claudia is a good friend of mine, my mom's and just about everyone else there.  She speaks fluent Spansh and is a very funny lady).  This kid looked like he was a 6th grader that was a little big (tall and kinda thick) for his age, but he had the education of a 1st grader which makes me think he was mentally handicapped.  Anyways he talked very loud and slow.  When I first heard him I though he was talking loud because Claudia was Hispanic, but I soon found out that wasn't true.  He counted out his money (5 $1 bills) one by one very loudly.  When he was done and he handed the money to Claudia he asked her if that was right like 5 times.  It was so funny I could barely hold the laughter in until he left.  Right after it happened, Claudia and I had a good laugh, then she went to go tell a couple of her other friends and they all laughed.  I had a couple customers that I thought were Christians, but I wasn't sure.  Friday, Mike (the second highest manager there) said we (he specifically mentioned me a couple of times) were doing a great job on front counter.  He told me he needed to get me more hours.  He already messed up my trust once so I can't be for sure if he was just saying that or if he was serious.  Anyways, one of the two highlights of this day was my involvement with a co-worker.  Her name is Hortencia (I think that's a very beautiful name, but anyways...).  During one of our non-busy times, she asked me to smile.  I don't know if she knows English, but someone had to translate for her.  After I smiled, she laughed and went back to doing her grill job.  After I got off, she asked me my name.  Once again, someone had to translate for her.  I kinda got the impression that she liked me.  I think she's cute, and having a cute girl talk to you is pretty exciting (well for a single loser who's never dated before it is).  Anyways after that day I had to walk home.  It took me about an hour to walk all the way home.  I walked because I ate before I left.  When I got home, I took a shower and got ready for Billy's party (Billy is an old friend from a couple of years ago).  It was always an inside joke among him, me, and his girlfriend Jennifer that she never threw him a party and she threw some other guy who wasn't her boy friend a party.  So, after a couple of years, she finally threw him a party and I was invited.  So, it was Jen, Billy, Stephanie, and me hanging out at Jennifer's house.  We got a pizza and rented a couple of movies, scary movies.  Boo! lol  Anyways don't ever watch the House on Haunted Hill.  It was filled with cussing and other not so good stuff.  I also saw Darkness Falls.  They had maybe 3 cuss words in the whole movie.  I wasn't scared by either one.  Idk, they were kinda stupid in that regard, but I was surprised at how clean the second one was.  Anyways, after that Billy took me home and we all had a great time that night.  Today (Saturday) was pretty cut and dry.  I woke up and instantly my dad told me to eat and then cut my yard and my neighbor's yard all by myself.  I don't know about you, but I would like to have woken up first and heard a good morning or something.  At any rate, I cut grass all day, then I got back inside to rest for a second before we went out to go play some baseball (just my sisters and my parents).  I had 6 rbi's for anyone that cares (that's 6 runs batted in).  I wasn't too bad overall.  After that, we went to Walmart and then I got online so send the beautiful message to you guys.  I hope you appreciate it.  Anyways, Steph was on and I didn't get to talk to her.  She was talking to Kyle about something that sounded serious so I let her do what she needed to do.  She said that I was sweet for letting her do that.  That was kind of weird.  Nobody ever appreciates the time someone else takes waiting for them.  It made me feel appreciated.  I'm on a quest for strength: spiritually, mentally, socially, and on the mental/spiritual aspect of physical.  I realized I depend a lot on my friends and because of that I was kinda hurt by the fact that Steph couldn't talk to me.  I wasn't mad or sad at her, but just sad that I couldn't talk to her.  I then realized I can't depend so much on my friends because they can't always be there.  I'm glad I was able to completely destroy my emotions and let her talk to Kyle.  It made me feel like I really did something good for once.  Anyways, I'm out.  Talk to you guys later.  Strong man, Joshua
