There is no haircutting saloon on campus, but there are two roving barbers who visit hostels as well as faculty residences, etc. The main advantage with this slightly awkward arrangement is the saving on time. Ordinarily, we would have to go to Purania Chowk in the city to get a haircut. A lot of students do go to the Chowk saloon as they don't like the services of these barbers. As far as I am concerned, I am pretty satisfied. It was quite a unique experience though.
