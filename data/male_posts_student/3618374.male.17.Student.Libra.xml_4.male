I can't swallow anything without an inordinate amount of pain. Last night, I took a little too much of Grandpa's great cough medicine, and it fucked me up pretty bad. I still feel it- not good. Solitary drinking is not a habit I want to get into. I saw the Day after Tommorow yesterday. That's a good movie. I am totally in love with Emmy Rossum. I swear to God, she's the perfect woman. If I could find a completely gorgeous intelligent humorous 17 year old, i'd be goddamn set. If she ever shows up in Calgary, she better be on guard for an Andrew with amorous intentions. On guard? Nah. I'm sure I can succeed in charming a beautiful young woman with little or no help. I really need to start practicing again. This infection crap is killing my practice. If you're reading this, this is also going to be a drum practice journal of sorts. Good Today: Single stroke rolls, threes on bass drum. Crappy Today: Nothing. Woot.
