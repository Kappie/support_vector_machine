Being called a Lazy Shit by my Dad. I'm not having a go but there are A LOT of people my age who don't work! I work, I hate it but I work, so how am I lazy??? I don't get how one minute my Dad can be perfectly fine with me and the next he's a complete and utter prick and he won't stop bullying me (so to speak).          I'm having one of those days today whee I really feel like lashing out on the first person that does anything wrong to me, I haven't been like this in ages!
