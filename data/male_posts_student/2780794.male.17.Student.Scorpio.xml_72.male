[Sorie..Tanni overdose...] Aniwae,back to the match report...    SP and RP met for the first time as they faced off in a friendly match. Play started out pretty fast with the SP floorballers controlling play well in the centre and defence. RP was struggling a little and it seemed that cracks could appear anytime soon. SP's first goal was a set-piece that worked very well as the positioning of the players were perfect. Adzmin got a free-hit at the corner of the RP goalpost and swung a perfect ball across the mouth of goal. The ever-present Akil ghosted in at the farpost and gave the perfect set-up to Hafiz to half-volley into goal. The crowds roared as SP begin to gain control of the game.    The next period came in fast and powerful as tackles and the pace increased. SP and RP were coping with the increasing pace pretty well as both traded early blows to both goals. However an error by the RP defence led to another goal. A ball was gifted to Jie Hong who then slipped it to Andy who slapped it into goal. GOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!! The crowds cheers were so loud it could have brought the whole hall down. Then a few minutes later,Yew Jie scored from a free hit by Kin Leong from the far corner. WOOOHOOOO!!!! SONG BO!!!! wakhakahkahkhakhkha! [Heineken must have been the caused of this error in typing] However,the freshies do not want to lose out in the scoring fest as Faliq did a fancy turn around in front of goal to score a stylish goal. What arrogance yeah?    The third period came pretty smooth as RP played all their players in one line. This proved futile as their endurance began to wane. SP continued with their controlled play and scored against the run of play via Faliq who received a nice ball from the right and whacked it to GOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!! [this is another case of carlsberg swimming in this writer's brain....] SP was overjoyed as RP would find no way into the SP goalmouth. They conceded valiantly and we wish them gd luck in the IVP!!! HIP HIP HOORAY!!!!!!    -=]ehz thambi, i need help in people writing match reports.
