It makes me mad because people that see it are all dissappointed and say it sucked because it wasn't scary. I didn't see it that way. The people that see that movie in that way simply do not have the mindset or intelligence to comprehend the severity, brilliance, and everything about that movie. It just makes me mad. Real mad. I hate the way a lot of people go see movies that have nothing to them they see movies that dont make you   do   anything. They dont go to movies that make you think or comprehend or interpret anything. They have no culture or intellegence they are just mindless stuck up mother fuckers who just get drunk and/or high and go to a movie, and thats the only way they have fun. It pisses me off.  On a more cheerful note I just saw a Loraine skit from MADTV. They are hilarious!!! If anyone shares this opinion word to yo mamma.
