I tried a dotTK but it said that I already had an account for my account, which I don't and cjb.net is introducing ads to its pages from August 1. This ".up.to" will be ok for now, unless I can get into dotTK.      On another note, I've almost finished the database for the YouthWork magazines, which is good *Yay Â£5!*
