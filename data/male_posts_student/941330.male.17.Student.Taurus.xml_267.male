Much like he did with Shawn Bradley.  At a baseball game: Spider-Man: My Spidey-sense tells me that Bonds will be intentionally walked tonight with runners in scoring position and first base open. Mary-Jane Watson: Your Spidey-sense is very strong, but any idiot could pick that up. Spidey, why do you protect me? Spider-Man: That's an easy decision. Not as easy as the decision to purchase MLB.TV on my laptop for the low, low price of $14.95 a month. You get 280 live streaming games each month, right on your computer. But I want someone to watch those exciting interleague games with me, MJ, so I have no choice but to protect you. Mary-Jane: Oh, Spidey, I had no idea. Kiss me.  Aunt May: Peter, your Uncle Ben once told you that with great power comes great responsibility. But I worry that your power may be chemically enhanced.
