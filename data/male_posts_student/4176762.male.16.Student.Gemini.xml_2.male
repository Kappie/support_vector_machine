I guess its something about knowing you're gonna get killed if the essays dont get finished by tomorrow that helps you shit papers out faster.  Well, I gotta go to school now.  But I was so happy that i finished writing last nite (this morning) that I could have sworn the Super Smash Bros. guy came out of no where and said "congradulations!" Until next time
