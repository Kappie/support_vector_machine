That will only be in four months. I want a celebration CD when I finally drive around on my own to listen to for a couple weeks. I am looking to burn a compilation CD of my favorite "Driving songs." I have several that are great driving songs, but I want more so I can eventually have too many and cut some. Give me some ideas. When I finally have my finished roster, I'll blog it. I had a lot of ideas I can't remember. If you remind me of one of those or match one with one on my list, I might just give you a little prize thing. Comment with suggestions! I like all kinds of music, even rap, unless it is vulgar, a terrible beat, or both. Anyway, blog ya later!   In Christ, Mike >  "A miracle starts with the beat of a heart." - SCC
