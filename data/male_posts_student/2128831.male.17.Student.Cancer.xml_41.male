Well if the nude pic thing was like for Playgirl or some tasteful gay magazine.  I would take the $10,000 dollars. But if it was one of those nasty SM mags I would have to pass. No shame here on this body. It's not perfect, but I don't know many real ones that are...so what the hell. But I will state that if the nude pic was something gross, I'll dance nude. Hell I do that at home now, I just don't get paid for it.  God!  My throat hurts, and for once it isn't like sex, but no I am all dried up, and scratchy and not fun at all!  I don't know why I am sick.  I am I guess that is all that matters, I had three popsicles before I came to school and when i entered the building I am utterly miserable.  *sigh* I will keep my mouth shut!   Wait Will quiet? Call the newspaper!   So, most people are afraid of death, I am not sure why.  Maybe the not knowing but we don’t know anything as it is now.  I know its something that you don’t need to trepidate over, its only bloodcurdling when you witnesses such things and not so scary.  I mean to say I have witnessed death in its purest form and even some less pure.  The witnesses are more traumatized then the individual that is doing the dying.  Most people I know that have died said while they were dying that it didn’t hurt.  Pain is arbitrary, fake and false as the smile on my face.  You are so indecisive in this world in which we don’t know up from down and right from left.  You never will know pain because it doesn’t live.  It isn’t real.   And I am right to an extent, sadomasochist and masochists they enjoy pain but pain is something that isn’t enjoyable, right?  Can you have pleasure from an injury?  I would say so, so pain isn’t a feeling but a mental state.  Sex is painful, but it offers pleasure.  How are we to sure about pain?  I mean I used to find pleasure in self-mutilation, in that pain, and it that ever really possible?   Creepy *Twilight Zone music*    THE GROCERY LIST FROM HELL   A trip to the grocery store is, in some ways, like a trip to the museum. There are many interesting items to look at. You can pick some things up and examine them. And some things are just so old they're practically relics. They really should make those "best before" dates a little clearer.  I'm in a list mood today. So here goes my list of grocery items that are never -- and I mean NEVER -- to be put on my grocery list.  I mean I eat them now becuase i am not in charge of the household, but when I do have my own I will not buy these items... INSTANT COFFEE- All advertisers for this product (name a brand, any brand) should have their offices raided and quarantined until they stop lying to us. You've seen the ads. The person waking up, making their coffee and enjoying it like it's the best damn beverage they've ever had. IT'S INSTANT, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! If I'm not mistaken, instant is latin for "it's easy to make, but it sucks." SARDINES- Yechh. Nope, not enough emphasis. YECHH!! Much better. I can't for the life of me figure out how people can stomach these. "Gee, honey. Are ya hungry? Howz about some crappy canned miniature fish?" GRAPEFRUIT- I'll put on my Chandler Bing hat for a moment. "Could these BE any more sour?"Besides lithium is a permament chemical in my blood... drrr! COTTAGE CHEESE- This stuff looks like it could be used as some sort of half-assed lubricant and has practically no flavour at all. (Sarcasm alert) I can definitely see the appeal. It's okay in lasagne, though. Put all the ingredients for lasagne next to it, and all will be forgiven. LIVER- It's rich in nutrients and will give you strong bones -- or something. No thanks. Given a choice, I'll take osteoporosis. MARGARINE- Anyone who would confuse this crap with butter needs their head AND their taste buds examined.  FISH STICKS- I liked these as a kid, but then what do kids know. OLIVES- I've seen these eaten like they were hors d'oevres. I tried an olive once (green, I think) and it had me wondering what the inside of an old rubber hose must taste like. PROCESSED CHEESE SLICES- Ugh, not in my fridge. Isn't it cute, though, the way fast food joints work the term "processed cheese" into their blurbs while describing how delicious their burgers are? Mr. Subliminal they ain't.  MARMITE/VEGEMITE- I actually love this stuff, but I've listed it because of the horrified looks I get when I eat it. You'd think I was eating from a cadaver, or something. I'm done for now. Thoughts from the masses? My ears are open. My mind is another matter, entirely. Stay tuned...
