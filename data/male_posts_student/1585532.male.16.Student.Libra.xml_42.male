I went to Knott's and met my friend.  There was much fun to be had.  And much fun we did have.  I started off around 10:30 ish, forgetting my satire camera and all.  Had some Del Taco breakfast, which didn't taste that bad, and I was off.  In or an amazingly boring day...or so I thought.  A whole bunch of Australians were there...and they were like...Americanized.  They had a whole crap load of logo'd and namebrand stuff.  It was creepy.  And so I met my friend who like..works there, that was cool.  I got reallly bored and played DDR for some time.  After that I like..kicked back for awhile in the shade.  Then around 1-ish, I met my friend who I hadn't seen since last year (may not be a long time to you guys but damn, it was for me!).  We hung out and had much fun.  I played DDR with my friend for the first time ever, and didn't do that bad.Then a bunch of other kids from Western dropped in.  Woo...kinda.  Liked it better when there wasn't as many people.  Oh well.  And yah, it was all good.  We all chatted and stuff, very fun.  No pictures due to my stupidness, by leaving my camera at home, which I shouldn't have done, but oh well..More pictures at a different time then.  Got home, talked to my most awesome friend online, and decided that I should buy a webcam since my Desktop Cam is semi lame.  Ate dinner, and now we're here.  Though I'm in a semi-bitchy mood.  Which sucks.  Probably since I stayed up last night and I shouldn't have, oh well.  Broke my computer chair today too.  Don't know who built this thing but it sucks.  I must steal my parent's old chair when they buy a new one for their computer.  Score!  Now I'm getting a coke and an apple pie from McDonalds.  Yay.  Well, I'm leaving.  I'm bitchy, and semi-tired...Bye.
