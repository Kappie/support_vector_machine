My grandparents have been camping at the lake for a week now and we went on a short fishing trip in his 21-ft DuckWorth jet boat (nice boat indeed). It was quite the adventure getting out of the docking area... not only was it congested with boats but the log boom surrounding the dock had been moved making the boat ramp/dock entrance wide enough only for about 1.5 boats... also the chop was pretty bad (the usual mid-afternoon). These conditions made it difficult to maneuver. As we waited to leave the dock, the back end somehow swung close to the dock, much endangering the prop. I rushed back there to push us away from the dock... my grandpa turns the boat to avoid this... and we end up into another boat. I am back there pushing us away from the side of the other boat as grandpa powers away... leaving me in the drink. COLD WATER... indeed. Fresh off Mt. St. Helens. I later caught two trout, which I cooked (in butter w/ lemon and onion) in tin foil over the campfire. This is definitely the best way to eat trout.  Independence Day today... still no plans.  Gotta love randomly babbling on about worthless information.
