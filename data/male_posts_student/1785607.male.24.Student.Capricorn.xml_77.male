You're tired of leaving well enough alone. If it's good for you, you'll welcome it into your life with open arms. Forget about what everyone else says is impossible. Upward mobility isn't a myth to the people who have earned it. You can see your way up the next few steps of the ladder. Grab on and start climbing. And even though changes made at this time are likely to be permanent, you don't need to look back. You're not one to miss scenery that was getting old.       ....   I've read a lot of profiles, a lot. The one I'm posting is actually in the same page as the horoscope above, so if you want to check yours go ahead and click the link above, its by Kelly Fox on  urlLink Astrology.com . Now, this "karma profile" is totally me... check it out:      Capricorn is the worker bee of the Zodiac. It has long-term goals in mind and works toward them constantly, sometimes to the exclusion of all else. This Sign may be the most determined and ambitious of the Zodiac; as a Cardinal Earth Sign, Capricorn combines the benefits of a grounded stability with a sense of initiative and ambition to work its way steadily toward the top. The trouble is, in the process this Sign may neglect other important life pursuits such as family, relaxation, fun ... Also, this drive to reach the top may be something of an empty pursuit, since "the top" often means simply the height of public recognition. Status and recognition, in themselves, aren't reason enough to do anything; Capricorn may lack a sense of humility or of the importance of contributing to the greater good rather than to one's own resume.  Capricorns make great students and employees; their commitment to perfection ensures they'll never turn in a sloppy report. This points to another of this Sign's weaknesses, however: Its perfectionism means Capricorn is afraid to make even the smallest of mistakes. As ruled by Saturn, the Planet of Karma, Capricorn is imbued with an undue sense of responsibility and tends to be sober and earnest as a result. To many Capricorns, there's no such thing as "one little mistake"; that mistake is the very one, in their minds, that could throw things off further down the line, ruining that grand plan they've been working toward since the very beginning. This mindset produces far too much stress; Capricorn must learn to lighten up, even if only for the sake of mental health.  This same mindset may also mean that Capricorn doesn't make such a great boss. The controlling urges that lead them to strive for perfect results from themselves allow them to expect no less from others. Behind closed doors, employees may call their Capricorn boss a slave-driver! This is that Saturn energy at work again; Saturn is sometimes called the taskmaster Planet, and Capricorn takes up where Saturn leaves off. Capricorns tend to think their way is the best way and have a hard time taking tips or directions from others. Capricorns make mistakes too, of course, and rather than making a big deal of it, Cap must learn simply to say "Oops!" and move on gracefully.  The worry that one mistake, no matter how minor, could throw things off in a major way gives Capricorn a rather fatalistic viewpoint. Rather than being unforgiving and inflexible, this Sign must learn to allow room for error. Part of the problem lies in being overly concerned with what others will think of them if their errors are made known. Capricorns must realize that others don't notice their "shortcomings" nearly as much as they do themselves; in fact, others may not consider making mistakes to be a shortcoming at all. If Capricorn can abandon the rigidity in this thinking, it will be freed to relax and do some truly inspired work.  Capricorn can look to Aries to learn how to move on quickly rather than deliberating or obsessively trying to attain perfection. Cancer can teach Capricorn about valuing family and the home over work and industry, and Libra can inspire Capricorn to maintain a balanced view of mistakes and, more importantly, that sweetness is a better way to get results than cracking the whip!       ....   And on the same note... Wow, how superstitious have I become... well, at least I believe this shows a little bit about me... Yeah right! Well, ok, it does. The next personal profile is the  sample  my date of birth gives, also by Kelly fox on the same place,  urlLink Astrology.com .      Birth Date and Time.... January 12, 1979 11:49 AM  Birth Location.............. Mexicali, Mexico   Sun Sign...................... Capricorn       Section 1: How You Approach Life and How You Appear To Others.  You have a sensible and realistic outlook on life and your two feet are always planted firmly on the ground (though you may, on occasion, have your head in the clouds). Others often see you as a rock of strength, solid, reliable, dependable, and constant. You are, in fact, amazingly consistent for you possess great powers of endurance and do not like to make changes or adjustments in your regular routine. You do things deliberately and methodically and do not easily accommodate the unexpected. Though you have a gentle, even soft, appearance, you are enormously strong-willed and stubborn. You go at your own pace and refuse to be rushed or pushed into anything before you feel sure about it. You can be coaxed and persuaded by charm, beauty, love, or affection - but never forced. You won't fight either, but simply stubbornly resist any attempt to coerce you to do something you do not want to do.   Section 2: The Inner You: Your Real Motivation.  Serious, disciplined, and quietly ambitious, you are driven to prove yourself and to achieve material accomplishments and success. Your work, your position in the world, and your contributions to society are very important to you. You will persevere through enormous hardship and frustration in order to reach a goal you have set for yourself, and you often sacrifice much in the area of personal relationships and home life in order to do so.      There you go... Just a peek at the inner me. Oh, it shows I have nothing to say or do at the moment. Wait! I have a test tomorrow, I'll star studying for it. Bye!
