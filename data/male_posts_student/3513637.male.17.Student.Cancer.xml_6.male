Care should be taken when heading for Bradshaw house area, Music school, tuck shop and other places of sightings. At these locations, there lurks a creature, foul, vile and strange enough devoid of nocturnal behaviour (though it does belong there), unlike his many ugly predecessors. The creature I speak of is Ben, Benjamin Be, he is a mystery and it is believed that his mind has become mentally inconsistent.   Benjamin Be is a shroud of mystery, no one can explain how he arrived at the name of Be, was it because he was lazy or was it because he thought capitalizing his surname would bring him fame, sadly, no one will ever know... One this is for sure, however he came by his name it has brought about many Mental inconsistencies that have left him retarded and screwed up in its wake.  The vile creature that is Ben has become popular talk around the county of Haileybury, but for what reasons, one should not become curious as they may become lost in a shroud of grope. Ben is a dangerous creature and caution should be taken when sighting has occurred, eye-contact should be avoided, approach shouldn't cross anyone's mind and most certainly DO NO FEED IT! IT MAY GROPE!
