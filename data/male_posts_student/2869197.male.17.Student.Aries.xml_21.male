I broke the unspoken law of solemnity that guides all great philosophers and thinkers. Follow? I did perhaps  the  most embarrassing video for A.P. Govt. In it, I lost any scraping of decency and went hogwild. It should be fun to get reactions from the fellow A.P.ers.   But I get ahead of myself. For the past 2 days, I have been at Alma College. My great reaping of checks, phone calls, and discussions has finally brought harvest. I'm kind of disappointed. It wasn't the childish energizers (or ice breakers or singalongs or what have you), because I expected that. It wasn't the antics of several of my fellow wanderers 'long the path towards God, because I expect this as well. It was the lack of discussion. I don't talk a lot (duh!). But when I do, I do so to learn or teach or incite happiness. Too much of the latter has occured. I did not learn as much as I would have in a free-flowing democracy of intellect. The irony is, that is almost what the keynote was preaching. She spoke of tying your rope to the foundation of your church, then going off to search, knowing you are free to return. In a way, I did this even by going to this Mix, as I am Christian Reformed and this was Presbyterian. At least a little discussion about Islam and the Diety of Christ placated my needs on the way back home.  I received a compliment today. Common people would shrug at this and say, "uhhhhhhh, so?" A while after expressing my heartfelt belief in the constant interaction and assistance of God in this world, I was spotted while trying to get my Bible. A girl said something to the tone of he is the most intelligent, awesome guy you'll ever meet. This frightened me. Not the compliment itself, as it was most kind, but the possible reactions. As most Christians boys and girls, I've had the negative concept of pride taught, drilled, beaten, and self-flaggelated into my psyche. Hearing such a sweeping compliment set off more than a few bells and whistles in that memory department. I am in constant alert against such things, always ready to mentally look to God and question, "What shall I respond in accordance with your will?" His answer is between Him and me. Reading what I just read frightens me again. Do not assume me to be some great theologian or prophet. I am a fool, a beggar in priestly robes.
