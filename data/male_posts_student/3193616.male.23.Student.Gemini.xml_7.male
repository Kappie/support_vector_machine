This sort of negativism doesnt take India to anywhere, other than Grave.We have parties openely saying that they come together only to keep BJP out of power without any shame in telling so. They should be ashamed to say so as the state of politics has come to such a pass that other's fall is hailed ur victory and not ur own victory. Parties take pride in not they had won but that the other had lost. I only hope  this too will pass
