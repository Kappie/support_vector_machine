The result, I got hurt. Just check August 14th ( July 30th ).  I noticed too that I tend to cling on relationships that passed until the moment I meet someone new, then I move on. Is not nice at all. Aside from this fact, I am really glad that I do know me, I can make mistakes but I know what I'm doing. I put a lot of feeling in all I do, in my everyday activities, still, I always have a clear head. And as someone told me once, I am not mischievous, but I do calculate and think all my movements... well, at least I try to.  Most of my archives are relationship related, and that's something I also said wasn't going to happen. But is so powerful the feeling inside that I need to express it. I have a lot of bad poems ready to post, that I made in my hours of class, but I don't know if it is the polite thing to do. Now, with school ending, I'll have a lot of time to think and to reevaluate the way I behave in a relation. What I did? What I didn't do? Was I good? Was I bad? or just hate him... whatever comes natural at the time. In fact, now, if I remember our relation, and I think of all the lies, the way he treated me, etcetera, I just manage to mouth:  bastard!  LOL  It is hard to be friends with someone that uses you, and then tries to be nice. Anyway, I have to reevaluate all my way of life and know what I want. I do know I want something serious, but now I have got in track again and I know Mexicali is not the place for me to live, I want to see the world.  For the moment, I'll put all my energy to get pass this next three weeks and then embrace Winter. Xmas is near, and I don't have this special person to share with. That's maybe the fact that makes me more angry about all this; most of my plans with him had xmas as a deadline. I never go more than a few months ahead, just in case. This time it was good I think this way. I had movies, shopping and trips planned, they all crumbled. Now passing xmas I can make new plans ahead. Just they'll have to be with me in a single mode.  All in all, I'm past all this, I feel fine now. I know I have some issues I have to cover, but those are for me to follow thoroughly. Bastard! Well... later my Matrix Revolutions review... maybe I won't post it, just let me tell you this: What the fuck!
