I managed to read though the novel a day before the book club and I find it to be very much to my liking. It falls firmly in what I consider to be  CyberPunk , in which instead of technology being the basis of bigger and faster action like in  Star Wars  and  Star Trek , it uses technology to bring to light the essence, strength and overwhelming frailty of Human nature. I have nothing against both  Star Wars  or  Star Trek , but sometimes I just need a good dose of a more gritty type of science-fiction.  And what a concept the book paints, a world were reputation is currency, where death is defeated by “back-up” booths and forced-grown clones, where computers are implanted and all set against the backdrop of  Disneyland . Yet with all the technology, humans are still subjected to the roller coaster ride (if you pardon the pun) of emotions such as failure, disappointment, betrayal and boredom.  In the end the book comes highly recommended. If you like you can download a full copy of the novel from  urlLink here .  All in all one of the best events I have attended in  urlLink Second Life  in some time. Looking forward to the next one.
