So exciting and innovative.  Now what are they?  Days spent home hanging out with the parents.  And Tyke is getting used to it.  Not that his parents are bad but he doesn't want to be spending his weekends sitting at home watching old movies and listening to old music.  But that is what he has been doing.  Today was not what he was hoping for.  He woke up about 11.  Which was cool.  Then he got his haircut a little later.  He played some 4-player Halo by himself (fun for a while actually).  Kinda sad though when you are pretending that there are other people playing with you when really it is just you downstairs by yourself talking to the couch and the love seat.  At around 3 PM he went outside to get the mail.  Well he ended up just standing out there waiting for the mail truck to come.  But he did have a reason to be waiting for the mail.  Since grades got sent out, he needed to pilfer the mail and keep it for himself.  Kind of an underhanded move right there and it could prove to be the wrong move later on but for now it worked.  So he took the grades and now has them in his room.  Oh yeah, his grades are horrible if you were wondering why he did this.  2.817 just to let you know.  Yeah, Tyke had a bit of an off semester.  Well really he just didn't work at all.  It won't affect college though.  The beauty of his school being an easy school is evident here.  Later on he watched some TV and played some games and shuffled cards a lot.  He played a game of Solitaire and only minorly cheated to win.  He likes to just flip 1 card at a time sometimes.  The fun for him is winning.  Not playing.  So that was that part of the night.  For dinner he had some chicken that had like mushroom sauce on it and some Mexican rice.  The rice was good.  Tasted a lot like some good enchiladas.  All in all, it was good.  After dinner he putzed around downstairs and played some basketball by himself.  He fake play-by-played the game he was playing.  He has grown up doing that so it isn't like it is something new for him.  Just something that kept him entertained in Preston.  He did it for all sports he played in his old house.  Baseball (with miniature bats and yarn balls), basketball, soccer, ping pong.  Not so much ping pong but he played.  A little later he decided to watch a movie by himself (notice how he is including "by himself" everytime to try and emphasize the fact?).  He realized he still hadn't seen Catche Me if You Can so he popped that in and watched it.  He actually thought it was pretty good.  During the movie he texted Dotti and that was pretty much the highlight of the night seeing as that was the most interaction he got with a non-family member all day.  Tyke is really confused now.  He isn't even sure what he is trying to figure out but he just can't comprehend anything with his brain now.  But listening to The Beatles is helping.  Tyke doesn't know how anybody can hate all of The Beatles songs.  He doesn't actually know anybody who does but there shouldn't be a person anyway.  Again, Tyke is confused.  For English he thinks the song he is going to analyze will be Nobody Knows it But Me by Babyface.  Or a song like that.  Not something funny so much as sappy.  Tyke can make that easier than making something funny.  Being funny is hard.  Being romantic is easy.  Writing papers is hard.  Writing poems is easy.  Or at least in Tyke's case this is true.  He actually might go write some poetry now.  Some good stuff.  Well, let's all hope for Tyke's sake that next Saturday is going to be a day packed full of fun events.  Cuz this one wasn't.  That is why he is blogging before 11PM.  BLEH!
