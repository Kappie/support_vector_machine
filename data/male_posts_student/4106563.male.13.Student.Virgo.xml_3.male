If you can read that tiny, little note at the bottom of the screen that says, "Note: This is an actor/actress portraying a lawyer.", then you are in luck. If you're dealing an injury case (in a car accident or something other than that), your eyes could be dialated from the crash (somehow), or just have a disablity (with eyes caused by the crash), you probably can't read it. If so, may just think, "I want that lawyer, he looks pretty good at doing his job.", and you get screwed over by the actor, figuring out that he's just an actor.  With other commercials (one), the only one, was from Burger King, "The Dr. Angus Diet" commercial. First, they had the font of the letters really small. Then, a couple weeks after the commercial premired, they changed the font size to a reasonable, bigger size.
