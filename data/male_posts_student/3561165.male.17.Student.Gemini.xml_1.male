Despite their music being fucking wondrous, and stuff, their lyrics leave an aftertaste not dissimilar to that off a piss-flavoured popsicle that you thought was made of appletise. "Exoskeletal", and shit. Just imagine if they were scousers, tee hee. As intellectually astounding as this apparent indifference to such rules of the english language as "syntax" and the conventionality of using words in order to articulate feelings and emptions, there is something afoot which is appreciably less-intellectual and that is George Orwell's brainchild, Big Brother. I don't care how many neuvo-artistes come out of the closet to apotheosise about this jumble of moronic fake-tan-clad shitbags incarcerated in front of the cash machine of cameras which will invariably loft them to fame, and then discard them to the scrapheap of Big Brothers eFourum, referring with "philosophical detachment" to the psychological incision of the human mind which this particular program allows. It's a morass of immorality, tedium and abjection, so as my latest victim of plagiarism would say, fuck it. Poor, poor, poor Mr Tribune.   In other moron related news, Oasis are headlining Friday Night at Glastonbury tonight. Only one Beatle-progeny is among their lineup tonight, oh well if a double-decker bus crashes into Noel, I'm sure Dhani Harrison will be more than affable to Liam's willingness to create the Beatles 2. They might as well change their name to the new Beatles, then change it back to Oasis in oh-so-Spinal-Tap-stylee. England were humiliatingly dumped out of Euro 2004 last night, which was a bit morose and shows just how superficial ye olde English game is, with Englands success being hinged upon an 18-year newbie, with a total dissolution of any sort of hope or forward-thinking once said newbie had been removed from the field. Bleugh, at this rate, we'll never win another major football tournament. Also Beckham was dire for the sum of the tournament, and he needs not only to lose his captaincy, but also be dropped entirely, as he was an embarassment to his team on the night and throughout the tournament. My randomly instinctual method of finding winners now leads me to the door of the "Cz-Czech it out" Republic.   In other news, been reading a bit of Descartes and a bit of Carl Jung, the latter being infinitively more interesting and engaging. I find a lot of his ideas about the way we behave in the world and behavioural complexes (through the supression of our own ideas, and our own realities and unrealities), love at first sight (anima/animus, you could say alongside the other archetypes), introversion and extroversion, collective unconscious and so forth. I'm in general agreeance with everything besides synchronicity and the collective unconscious, as I don't feel that they are substantiable. I presume that the majority of modern thinkers are in adherence with that, I certainly feel that his ideas have more weight to them than anything by Sigmund "I wanna shag my Mummy" Freud. Meh, poor Laura just said she erased her hard drive. Anyway, people I've ranted on for far too long, byeness.  Mood: Supportive (for Greece! Come on Greece! You are so Greecey!)
