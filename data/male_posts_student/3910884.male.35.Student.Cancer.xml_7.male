     
      Aetan community at Sitio Calapi, meeting with some home study participants. Angelicum volunteer hasn't been around since October. Volunteer was supposed to help tutor them.    They have problems with math, science, and english.    They are looking for tutors to assist them with their questions.    Limited resources for tutoring. Possible primary school teachers as a tutor source. Volunteers would probably come from a different location.
