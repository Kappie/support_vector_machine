This in itself has been expected, as noted in most commentary I've read (links here are to the  Boston Globe  mostly because it's my newspaper of choice), and Tenet doesn't seem to have been particularly competent (whether or not the administration allowed him to do his job).  What disturbs me is the following item from  urlLink this article :  "Tenet tacitly accepted the Defense Department's decision to create a new intelligence branch, the Office of Special Plans, after neoconservatives -- particularly Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz and Undersecretary Douglas J. Feith -- insisted that the CIA was not properly assessing the dangers posed by Hussein.  "The existence of the new office, which reportedly collected information from exiles, including Chalabi, infuriated many analysts in the CIA who had monitored Iraq for decades. But after the war, when members of Congress began demanding answers for the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, White House leaders pointed to the CIA, not the Defense Department."  Aside from reading like a classic end-around, this would seem to reinforce the article's points that politics played a big role in some of the events that have taken place involving the CIA.  I love the whole bit about the CIA "not properly assesing the dangers posed by Hussein," which reads suspiciously similarly to "not telling the Bush administration what it wants to hear."  That, of course, seems to be par for the course right now.  Besides, is it me, or does the name  Office of Special Plans  sound really sinister?
