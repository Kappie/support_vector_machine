It's almost the same as my life and I can really relate to it. I hope I get new clothes that actually reflect who I am and what i've delt with. But no money for me. I want to lose weight since I have some fat in the stomach. Any suggestions other than giving up doritos in which i adore. The fourth week of July started with me waking up and turning on my brother's computer because he's gone camping, of course someone walks in(my dad) and says you're up early even though it's only nine. Then the privacy invasion starts because I actually thought I could have some time to myself on the computer without people coming in and out of the room and talking like they're speaking to someone three houses down. After that I read a book I haven't read in a while and it's more interesting now than ever and then I decided because I'm bored as hell to go out for a bike ride. I need more to my life and I need suggestions other than hangin out with people around here because there's only a little hang out group who are total losers and there's this other guy who has his own "rap group". I wish I could spend for time with carrie but she has stupid summer school. Anywho I'm gonna go and watch some television at midnight and pray that my so called family can leave me alone and actually sleep. BYE
