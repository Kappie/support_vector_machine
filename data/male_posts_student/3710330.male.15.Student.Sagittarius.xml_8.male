Just taking a break while I'm getting someone to replacing the midnight oil I had been burning(might decide to use electricity instead).       Ive yet to talk about myself, well, I keep that a secret for the time while(though I reckon no one gives a damn). Nevertheless, my class, 4C, is none lesser than an interesting class. a mixture of students of all standards, different intellectual capabilities and a mosaic of people with different talents whom all fit into the 2004 Class 4C hierachy.        My class, is has the most delectable, mouthwatering and vivacious handsome young man there is(sounds kinda gay). We are a bunch of students, who may be masterminds of wanton mayhem, but we sure do understand the logics of physics, the intrigues of mathematics, the grossness of biology, the enigmatic world of English, the mind corroding world of Chemistry, the morality of CME and the obfuscation of the humanities. In a nutshell, we are an eclectic mixture of elites.       Our teachers are the none the less charismatic and interesting. With Mdm Nabilah constantly on my tail and attempting to mould a mind which resides in the swings of the playground and Mr Phua with his perpetual attempts to finish Maths sums in record time. Not forgetting Mrs Seetho with her usual phrase "boys being boys" and Mdm Kwok, a maven with words, her usual sarcasms often leaving us nonplussed. Chemistry had been tumultous times, for there had not been any permanent teacher that put his heart and will to teach us(Only Mr. Tik was good enough, but sadly the ministry declined to allow Victoria to keep such a meticulous teacher).       42. Thats the number of times I failed to hand in homework(maybe more). Thats the number of times Ive been late for school. Thats the number of times(divided by 3) that Ive pontanged school. And, 42 is the number of students that are in my class. 42 is a great number. It has always been great. Far surpassing those of 34, 10, 27 and the like. Far more beautiful than the other numbers if you looked closely. And too having the privilege of bearing a special standing for our class. For it has always been 42, since Sec 3 and it will always be. If you try to divide 42 by anything, you will never get it to zero, for our spirit is always there, and it is there to instil courage in everyone one of us.       Luke, Boon Tat, Hong Xiang, Samuel Chee, their names will be etched in the records of 4C and so will the other 38. Luke, a person carrying a smile most of the time, is a very enjoyable person to be with. Trustworthy and diligent are the attributes that he possesses  ultimately. A very good friend of mine, he is a tall young man, with tanned skin, a very handsome face, free of the scars of pimples and     all dimples when he smiles. Excelling in his studies has always been his trademark, for his brains are of much higher order than us.       Xiang Jie, should I say, a joker, in our class. Somehow, it  seemed that he possessed hard feelings for me and his hands would get all itchy and fly down on my body with a sharp *thump*. A possible nocturnal creature, he spends his time either idling in class or sleeping. He has a niche for being crass, oftenly resulting  a disgruntled Mdm Kwok or laughs of mockery at him.(Haven't got anything to praise him, I dont have a good impression of him)            If your looking for a handsome young man with leadership as his forte, Boon Tat would be the person of your choice. A staff seargent in NCC Land, Boon Tat is a bona fide Casa Nova(sorry to repeat BT,  but you are really that attractive), the lady killer, the very man who will make any woman die for you. On top of that, Boon Tat's a very good monitor, he organises things well, and everything goes smoothly with him in the lead.       Samuel Chee. Some call him Cemetery(SameChee, rhymes eh?), but I call him by another, one that no one really uses, because it has a strong Engweish essence. A particularly quiet boy, with a squeaky  voice and a rotund body, he is the typical introvert. But behind that mask of inferiority, is a mind which works so furiously, his head literally swells and steams, teeming with information which constantly gets crammed into his mind. The only downside to his extraordinary intellect, is his utter defeat in sums.            Kenneth Leung. The great doctor, the mad scientist and the all-rounded extraordinaire. The smartest guy in our class, and, one of the play ones around too. Getting L1R5 of 6 is no mean feat for him, for his brains work at 109%(form a reliable source) of its capabilities, outstripping and outdoing us. Hes a very jovial creature, for when he smiles, you get a warm feeling rising from your insides, the impish smile, cheering you up.          42 is a big number. 42 is the number of times Im going to say I cant include details of all my friends. 42 is the number of students in my class. We have endured all difficulties together, embraced each other in times of trouble, played really hard and of course, studied real hard.       My memories of 4C will never be obliterated from my memory, not  even when Mdm Nabilah threatens to call my parents.
