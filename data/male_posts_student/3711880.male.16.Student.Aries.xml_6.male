And two cds, a South Park-CD and the music from Star Wars:... uh, the last movie *ashamed to have forgot the name, being a big fan of it and all*        I also ordered a GameCube yesterday, and pre-booked Tales of Symphonia. It'll most probably be here in the end of the week. All that's left's a memorycard...
