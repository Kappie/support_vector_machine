      Having very little to do this past week as I wait for next week, and my first days of work, to arrive, I think I've watched more television in one week than I have in the past year.  I've become particularly interested in watching Celebrity Poker Showdown.  Along with Court TV and all these investigation shows.  I have made it out to the pool and Naples pier, which is fantastic.  I also saw Farenheit 9/11 a second time, going with my very Republican Aunt and Uncle, which was amusing.  And I agree that Michael Moore is very slanted, and as he says, much of the movie is his opinion, and it is propaganda, and it is at times very heavy-handed, but there are still facts there.  Facts that can't be ignored.  The propaganda is pretty entertaining in itself, but beyond that are actual proven facts.  The movie hopefully will encourage people to do some actual research for themselves.  And as a bumper sticker I saw recently says, "let's not vote for W again in 2004."  I enjoyed your list, Glenn.  And for the most part I can agree with it.  I don't have the ambitions you have, though.  I'd like enough money to be comfortable, but having been here in Naples, which is half a pretty normal town, but the other half is very wealthy.  And wealth seems to equal snobbery, at least as much as I have encountered.  Of course, I'm having to work towards something, and I imagine that earning wealth by working hard as opposed to just being handed down wealth probably builds better character.  But I don't think I'd ever want to be wealthy.  I'd like to have enough to be secure, as you said, in paying my bills and being able to swing an emergency if that were to happen.  One home is enough for me.  I don't have the same motivations to compile such a list, but just for fun, here is mine:  1. Companionship:  As in a female companion.  I've been called "quirky-alone," though I'm not sure how much I agree with that label, but I am comfortable being alone, and I am "holding out" for that "special someone."  I don't want to ever end up with someone out of desperation or just because it's what people do.  But I seriously have hope and believe that I will one day meet that special someone.  I am really a hopeless romantic, and one day I'll get to put that to use.  2. Career:  I want to have a career, not a job.  I want to do something that I really want to do, regardless of what anyone else thinks I should do, and regardless of money.  I want to do something fulfilling.  I'm about to start work in the field that I am most interested in, so maybe this will be the start of what I am hoping for.  3. Financial security:  I can't imagine ever just wanting to be "wealthy."  But I want to be secure.  I want to know that my bills will be paid.  I want to know that I have some money in the bank in case of emergency.  I want to be able to afford some luxuries, which for someone like myself is not much at all.  As I've moved here, I have put myself in the position of being very low on money, really almost completely broke.  I've always lived paycheck to paycheck, as I'm sure you have, Glenn.  I hope to one day be a little more secure, one day soon, hopefully.  4. Circle of friends:  As cheesy as that sounds, friends are important.  I've been fortunate enough to have a few really great friends, ones that I always look forward to talking to and seeing.  Unfortunately, I've just left them five hours away.  I know nobody here in Naples, besides my family, but as time goes on I'll make new friends.  And now I want to play poker.  So I can only think of four right off the top of my head.  I'm not really in much of an existential crisis right now.  I am a little nervous about starting this new job.  For some reason, it feels a little like it used to feel right before a new year of school started when I was in high school.  Strange.  I went out and bought a shitload of clothes, basically half a whole wardrobe.  I've found a few spots locally to hang out.  And I picked up an amazing Antonio Carlos Jobim CD that I have listened to completely non-stop all week, for $5 at the local used CD store.  And I plan to see Spider Man 2 Monday.  So I guess that's all to report for now.  Back to Celebrity Poker Showdown.
