Performed with Aftermath and Captive Honor performed too at Molly Blooms II in Amityville. I made 10 bucks woo! That show wasn't that great, day show and not many people. But the night show at Molly Blooms here in Smithtown probably had about 100 people. It was awesome. Alot of people shook my hand and said great job, I was so happy. People kick ass. OH YEA, and this band called Cast of Shadows came on after us, they sounded pro. I wouldn't be surprised if they make it. Everyone in the band was amazing. They played A Certain Shade of Green by Incubus PERFECTLY. The drummer was going nuts, his hair was flying everywhere. It was awesome. Slept like a baby last night, all that drumming. This morning I hung out with Paul and went into town with him, said our last final goodbyes. We decided we're gonna perform on the Smithtown Elem roof. Haha no, but we're gonna go up there like Ricky and I thought of doing last summer but never did. We were gonna for the big Mars that was supposed to be big but it wasn't, damn retarded scientists. They made such a big deal out of it and I remember it looked like a star, big fucking deal. So Paul and I are gonna rap and sing Time and Time Again by Chronic Future at Kaiser's bday party. Originally his party was this Saturday comin but I'm just coming home from Montauk that night (going to Battle of The Bands at night) and Paul's gonna be in Vermont so we made him change it to next next Saturday, the 24th. Everyone's invited. Bring boos and cake as Eric would say. WOAH I just figured out how to make this post a few hours back so it doesn't show up as Monday when I'm really typing Sunday, well technically it's Monday but it's past midnight...k let me click on More Post Options. Wala! Back to Sunday. Anyways back to today, after Paul, I mowed the lawn then drummed my last drum, pretty good too. Then watched When Harry Met Sally with my papa. Now it's now and I still haven't packed and I'm leaving for Montauk tomorrow morning. Goodbye everyone.
