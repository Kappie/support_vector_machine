After lunch I did some revision, this time without  FIFA 2004  breaks in between. I've actually managed to do 2 hours solid Maths revision, even if it is  the most boring subject in the world . I'm only doing it because I have to, to get into a Computer Science degree at uni. I don't know who in their right mind would do a degree in it though. Crazy people.  I got bored of my blog template, so altered it to this green and grey number. Looks pretty cool. I've also messed about with the template a little, adding a links section on the right.  I've thought more about digital cameras and have been posting on a website forum to find out some more info. I'm pretty much set on getting a Canon Digital IXUS 500 - 5 megapixel camera - and an Archos Gmini 220 - a 20GB portable hard drive to put piccies on. I think I'll buy them as soon as the exams are over so I can use them on holiday, at ECTS and in Poland this year. The camera comes with a cool 640x480 video recording mode, which is quite astounding when you consider its size (half of a CD)! Here's some pictures of them:     Canon Digital IXUS 500   Archos Gmini 220   All the stuff for our new bathroom arrived today, so our house is full of huge cardboard boxes. I spend hours at work surrounded by cardboard, constantly knocking down boxes, putting it in bins and worst of all, moving soggy card around. Damp cardboard isn't pleasant, believe me. Anyway, while the building work is going on, we'll have no shower or bath. My mum is going to the gym and my dad will have a shower at work. That leaves poor me going round to neighbours' houses to have a shower in the morning. Won't that be fun!  In other news, it was a nice sunny day today,  Big Brother  (reality TV) begins tomorrow and I can't wait, there's loads of cool TV on tonight and a word that should be used more often is...   Bamboozle - To deceive by trickery; to cajole by confusing the senses; to hoax; to mystify; to humbug.
