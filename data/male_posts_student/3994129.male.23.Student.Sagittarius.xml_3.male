Bombarded with, alternately, alarmist warnings about the latest health scare, and the newest medical breakthrough/wonderdrug du jour...even the least skeptic begins to feel as if they're on a seesaw that really has no substance whatsoever.  Now, the question of whether or not my feeling ill is psychosomatic aside, I was faced with the ever-present choice:  medicate or deal with things au natural.  Since I've only been feeling mildly sick I chose the latter, and am currently riding it out.  Whether or not it was a good choice for me is irrelevent to you, of course, but I think it underscores that we all should question not only the way we percieve our health/illness, but how we treat it.  Is pumping ourselves full of medication from Pfizer(tm) advisable?  Without going into a rant about conventional healthcare vs. holistic medicine I will just say that we need to reevaluate our conception of health.  I'm sure many of you have seen the video of the maltreatment of chickens at one of KFC's suppliers.  I'm not a huge fan of PETA, nor a militant vegan, but Its clear to me that not only is this (routine) mistreatment appauling to all but the most callous people, but that the arguments and rationalizations for it are flimsy and pathetic.  Whether or not you eat meat has absolutely no bearing on the morality of situations like this (which are all too common in factory farming systems).  The bottom line is that it comes down to whether or not you respect animals as equals to people.  Without that understanding, maltreatment of animals is essentially a fait a compli, since they're nothing more than food.  If you eat meat, the least you can do is make sure the animals are treated ethically before they end up on your plate, in your stool, and flushed down your toilet.  The least.  Media Consolidation.  Its the wave of the future!!  With Sony and BMG officially completing their merger (first announced in late 2003), they now control about 22% of the music industry.  Combined with Vivendi Universal, they have a stranglehold on over 50% of the music industry.  There are now a total of FOUR (count 'em, 4) Major Labels (EMI, Universal, Warner, and the new Sony/BMG monstrosity).  Yay for choice!!  What's a struggling indie artist to do?  Oh yes, and about 2000 employees of the two companies are going to lose their jobs.  A final note, go out and buy some fresh Corn, its in season now.
