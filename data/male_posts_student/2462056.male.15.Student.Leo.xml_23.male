Probably because I have nothing better to do at that time of day.  Well Ben and I decided spontaneously to make a Counter-Strike clan, so we did!  Its called A.K.A., standing for the our oh so original slogan "Also Known As." Man, we are clever, coming up with A.K.A., man those 3 letters just roll right off your tongue.  So yep, someone is finally having another party this weekend! God bless Andy, the master of the parties.  Hmmm so yesterday... nothing happened, at all.  I had to cut the grass, and I did it with out music for once, and finished really quick! It was cool.  I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything else.  Last night Jordan and I had a "deep" conversation (over AIM) for a really long time for like, the first time in forever.  It was really cool.  Hmm then today... I still didn't do anything.... just kinda sat around, played a lot of Counter-Strike.  Tonight a mean game of Clue went down in the Grand residence, or as I like to call it, La Casa de Grande.  It turned out to be Professor Plumb with the rope in the kitchen.  That dirty BASTARD!  Yep, then when that ended... came back in here... played Counter-Strike.... I'm working on a site for the clan! So yeah, I'll give the URL when its done.  Hmmm well, I'm going to say this using code words, because I'm not allowed to say it normally.  Billy Bob and Ms. Crap-Apple date, and Billy Bob really likes Ms. Crap-Apple, but he isn't quite sure if Ms. Crap-Apple feels the same way back.  He really hopes Ms. Crap-Apple feels the same way back, and also really hopes that Ms. Crap-Apple would tell him if she didn't feel the same way back, because Billy Bob does not like to be played.  He also wants Ms. Crap-Apple to be happy, so he doesn't want to hold her back.  Yesh... silly little Billy Bob...
