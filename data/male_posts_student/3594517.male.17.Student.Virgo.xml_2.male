Two of the most sacred sites Mecca and Madina are the main attraction for Muslim pilgrims. But sadly, today Saudi Arabia is also turning out to be one of the most dangerous places to visit especially if you are a westerner. The reign of terror started when American troops established a base in Saudi Arabia while fighting Saddam Hussain in the 1991 Gulf war. And it has continued ever since. The groups affiliated to Al Qaida who are active in the Saudi kingdom have only one aim to topple the incumbent regime and to make Saudi Arabia a haven for all kinds of terror related activities.              Who is to blame in all this you make ask. The answer is not too long; the Saudi Royal family. They encouraged, financed and helped these terrorist outfits. The CIA and MI5 knew this, America never asked them to stop it because at that time these groups were not primarily anti-American. Now that fate has turned the full circle the Saudi Royal family is in danger of losing control over their kingdom. It wouldn't be unfair to say that you reap what you sow.
