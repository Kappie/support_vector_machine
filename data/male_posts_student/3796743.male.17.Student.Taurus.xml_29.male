It was awful, but I had a tanning appointment at noon, so I had to book it. After that I met my mom and sis for lunch at Appleby's. It was good, I love Applebys. Then we headed to the Tacoma Mall. Much better mall than here, which is why I drive a half hour to go shop there. My sister managed to spend three hundred dollars at abercrombie...again. I got one Abercrombie polo and a shirt at the Gap. But yeah, we conquered that mall. So school shopping is officially underway, just as scheduled. I had a lot of fun today. Oh yeah, and we went to Costco...alwyas fun. So yeah, tomorrow, I'm not up to much. I was thinking of actually starting on my AP Gov assingment. Seeing that it is due in ten days. hmmm....or maybe I'll put it off till later. Anyways. That's all I've got for today.   "The world is beautiful, but it has a disease called man" - Nietzsche  I used to think we drank margaritas together because we were having fun, but now I think we were having fun because we were drinking margaritas.  G'nite.
