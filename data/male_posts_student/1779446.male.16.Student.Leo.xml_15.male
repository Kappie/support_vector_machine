Why are girls so beautiful? Why is it that every where I see I see those beautiful, leggy creatures that seem to roam around with a surreal grace? I think, aside, from cheeseburgers, that I have a new vice. Women.  Is it really possible that maybe love is just plainly a biological recation that takes part inside the brain? What ever it is, it is tormenting my poor moral structure and tempting me with beautiful young pretty things! You do not know how frustrating this is! maybe it's just puberty, maybe I'm in the testostorome laden stages of my life where my desires spiral totally out of control.  The girls ain't helping either. Wearing tight shirts, mini skirts that reveal long, slender legs and supple thighs... crap I gotta shake it out of my head!   Rest assured, I'm not becoming a perverted piece of porn, but it's just a longing, a wanting, for a piece of this beauty, something to hold, to keep me warm. Why do the girls have to be so pretty? WHY? Why are they so intelligent? Why do they always see right through me? Am I caught in a rapture because of something so beautiful?  I can't help myself really, every time a girl walks past I JUST HAVE TO LOOK! Luckily there isn't *that* much eye candy in my school. Otherwise I would be branded a pervert. Heck maybe I am, but I feel that this ain't a dirty lust.  Maybe it's a bit of their ethereal grace, leggy beauty, sass, that makes them so hard to get. So far off like stars in the sky. I always want what I can't get...   Thank goodness for the blog, I cannot possibly keep these feelings pent up ANY longer. But girls are so awesome, they are the bane or my life and the only glimmering dream I can see when I am awake.    I gotta go, I've gotta go sleep, hopefully my mum doesn't ban me off the internet.   Cheers,  Colin
