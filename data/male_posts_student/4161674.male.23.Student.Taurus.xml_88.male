I decided to try a few more films to see if this was a one-time phenomenon or not. So I watched  urlLink The Return of Count Yorga , a badly acted, written, shot, and directed vampire movie from the drive-in's best friend, American International Pictures. Yep, I still enjoyed it more than  urlLink The Ladykillers . (I'm kind of ashamed to admit that I actually rewound the Robert Quarry fangfest and watched it again.) Then I moved on to a few  urlLink Three Stooges  shorts. Yes even Larry, Curly and Moe brought forth more yuks than  urlLink The Ladykillers . With empirical evidence to back me up, I can conclusively state that I hate, hate, hate the movie  urlLink The Ladykillers  and it was 97 minutes of my life wasted. Aren't you glad I got that off my chest?
