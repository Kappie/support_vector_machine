Right...so i'm about 3 seasons too late into my Soprano's kick, but I just officially started with Season 1....I love it man....every bit of it...I'm mad I missed the premiere of Season 4 last night  The Raiders-Steelers game was excellent though....the Steelers look BAD so far....and I for one couldn't be happier....  My Falcons....ahhhh...my Falcons....three turnovers in a row???...that score should have been so much worse....so credit is due to the defense....but as I was saying on soulcity....we need recievers!!!....  I've heard good things about "Barbershop"....frankily I didn't care if all of the critics and all of my people bombed it though....I am still going to see it....it passes the initial tests for me...and that's all that matters...maybe I'll convince someone to take me to see it some day this week....  well....I had more to say...but I'm not gonna say it now....so......peace
