Hopefully, I am succeeding in this. Like most blogs I guess I might as well discuss what I did today. I'll try and make this as short as possible. Woke up, shower, post office, Best Buy, home, Subway, home, tennis, Justin's house, home, girlfriend, shower, girlfriend, back to Justin's house, Cane's, home, girlfriend, and finally movie. You can fill in the rest of the details yourself, just don't think anything perverted happened, cause it didn't or else I would mention something. By now, you're probably wondering what happened to me. Truth is absolutely nothing. I figured you needed something to attract the reader, i.e. a catchy title. Sorry for leading you on, but you'll get over it.
