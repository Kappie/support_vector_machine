It's a long weekend, but no matter how much I try not to think of school, there's little else to think of right now.  That and the computer...  It's been stressing me out lately.  My Windows XP User Account got busted up.  It wouldn't run Internet Explorer properly.  I had to create a new account and change all the settings to the way I had them again. =.=  I decided to just leave the desktop the way it is, and blah everything I haven't changed unless I need to.  I might just put up the blog today... This is one is getting on my nerves.  Yeah, I'll do that.  -ArV
