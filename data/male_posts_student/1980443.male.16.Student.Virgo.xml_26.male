God was so gracious to bless us with a team and a place to practice.  Being a professional baseball player has always been one of my dream professions.  TO get up every morning and play a sport, plus make G's of G's.  What a life huh? Of course only if God wanted me to.  I'm definately thinking about playing college ball, there's still alot to learn.  It's always been a passion of mine, my dad really pushed me to love baseball and I'm glad he did.  My little brother isn't quite the same as me but that's pointless information that you don't need to know.  Later Players The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will
