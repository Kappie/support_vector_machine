I thought everything was going to be okay last night but today just, well, 'inhaled vigorously.' I'm trying to think about other things but I pretty much can't. I pray that I have not lost two of my best friends and if I have lost either one of them I simply don't know how I'm gonna handle it.  No worries anyone  just needed to continue my pitty-party and thought that since I hadn't posted in a few days I would post something now.
