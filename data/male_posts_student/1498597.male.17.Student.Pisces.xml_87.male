Welcome to the  Graveyard Shift  I think that it could use a lift So I'll try a brand-new trick, and write this blog in limeric  I don't know, but I forget why I'm on the Internet On normal standards, its pretty late but I'll type this blog at any rate. So your wondering,"What is new, on the  T.E.W. ?" And my reply to you all would be: "There's nothin' new, as you can see!"  Then why did I sign on  AOL ? Easy, see...I'm bored as hell! Porn's the pro, but here's the con: Nobody is fuckin' on! I'm pretty down and pretty blue cuz there's no one on to talk to! But I remember this one fact it's pretty simple, not abstract. Here's the answer, I know I'm right! Normal people sleep at night! But you know, as you can see, I'm not normal!  I'm just me!  Like a flower or a rose this poem must come to a close. But, thank God, it's perfect timing cuz I'm tired of fuckin' rhyming! So, I apologize, my friend but its over, done-the end...
