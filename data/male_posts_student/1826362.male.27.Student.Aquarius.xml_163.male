Spring Break '04 rocked!   when I was 18-22, spring break meant a road trip from maine to florida in a) a 1980 chevy impala with a rusted out hood, a leaky transmission, and an exhaust that would come loose from its moorings 40 miles outside of Richmond b) The Urban Assault Vehicle (a.k.a. The Hamborghini) c) Eesh's Ferrari 4-runner.  This road trip involved lots of peeing into cups and bottles (my favorite was always the empty Tide bottles we would pick up from the Hippie's house in VA; the residue from the laundry detergent had a nice way of neutralizing the smell), flirting with carloads of women by asking them if they "want a cookie?!", watching Bill Bush flex on Daytona beach, Watching Bill Bush flex in Savannah Georgia, watching Bill Bush flex in Key West FL, eating peel and eat shrimp with the waitress of a bar during the 8 am-noon happy hour that would kick off a legendary fat day with Eesh and Mac, and a lot of other stuff I am leaving out or have forgotten.   This year spring break meant actually doing the homework that had been assigned over the break, going to NYC with my girl, (where we upheld the spring break fat-day tradition of spending an entire day either eating, drinking, or being on our way to either eating or drinking) hanging out in brookline, doing some laundry, and sleeping a lot.   But the spring break topic gives me the opportunity to let you in on my brother's million dollar idea.  You know how they have those girls gone wild spring break videos?  well his idea is a guys only version called Guys Gone Nuts, where the camera runs around asking guys to "show us you're nuts!"
