There was crap scattered everywhere: clothes littered the floor, cables were overflowing from tupperware boxes, books were hanging from the ceiling.  It was overwhelming.  Darah is going to go to hospitality school soon.  She's like a personal organizer, except she's free, and not made of plastic.  She comes over and she starts directing me: go there, throw this away, I said  throw it away !  I love it.  I must've gotten rid of half my clothes, three quarters of my shoes, most of my old papers.  It was like getting a life enema.  That desire to cling to the old junk is weak.  Reminiscing is really just foolish sentiment -- living in the moment is way more fulfilling.  So most of my stuff is now in boxes.  All that's left are some pictures on the walls and a clown wig.  The movers are coming at 8:30 on Monday morning.  This weekend is also Carissa's birthday, so tomorrow I'm going to figure out a way to get to Grand Prix Racerama.  I actually had a birthday at Grand Prix once.  I was nine.  Life is a golden shower of glittering gifts.
