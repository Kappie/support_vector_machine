Im listening to forty days by apollo 440, and its really good. :) :) :) :P :) :) :) :)                                                                                                                             ^ yawn. me ish bored.                                                                                             |   me                                                                                                                              | today was my grandpa's birth day. he's 67. i am 13. i will die in like 50 years. That would be in 2053. kind of cool year to die.its... diferent. every one dies in 1996 or 1987 or 1965 but im dying in 2053... does anyone know Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time? Its a game on the Super nintendo. the go to the futures, etc. im gonna die on one of the last scenes. cool. besides, its my favorite scene. it has really good music, and you travel through the future city's streets. I love teenage mutant ninja turtles.  Power rangers, pokemon, digimon, and all of that crap sucks. its nothing compared to the turtles. power rangers or any of those would never say: "suck it to me baby" "DAMN!" "fuck you!" or "SHIT" in one of their shows/movies. they use cheap ass guns that only blow you away, and they dont even trespass you, teenage mutant ninja turtles has organized crime, death, torture, drug abuse, punks, prostiitution, rape and [pizzas and] kick ass fighting. They fight so cool. and the family message. thats something. and the way shredder gets his ass kicked at the end of the first movie! (splinter the rat throws him off a building and he falls in a trash truck, and the dude, uh... the hockey guy whatever his name was, says: "whoops!" like, sarcastically and pulls down a lever, and the trash truck turns on and crushes shredder's head. It's so good.. and the way the blood comes out of his helmet... blood would never have an appearance on power rangers.    TURTLE POWER
