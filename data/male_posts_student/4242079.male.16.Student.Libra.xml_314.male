From  ABC.com :   Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital is the haunting new 15-hour drama series created directly for television by the award-winning, bestselling master of horror. Using Lars Von Trier's Danish miniseries Riget (a.k.a. The Kingdom) as a point of inspiration, King tells the terrifying story of The Kingdom, a hospital with a bizarre population that includes a nearly blind security guard, a nurse who regularly faints at the sight of blood and a paraplegic artist whose recovery is a step beyond miraculous. When patients and staff hear the tortured voice of a little girl crying through the halls, they are dismissive of any suggestion of mysticism or unseen powers … but at their own peril.    It's got it's moments full of cheese, but who can name one creation of the horror genre that doesn't? Anyway, if you're even remotely a King or Horror fan, you should check it out. In Red Deer, it's on ABC (Channel 20) at 11pm on Wednesdays.  And guess what that means? It's on....RIGHT NOW!
