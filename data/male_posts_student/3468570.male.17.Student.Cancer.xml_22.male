I guess I won't want my PW efforts recognised, or it would be devastating to me to share the credit earned within the group which will make me a free-loader in actual fact.  Maths Common Test comin' up soon....but I really am not bothered to study for it. Perhaps studying and practising on a few tutorials may help, but I guess it's not goin' to work too! It is a good thing that Functions is not involved in the Test, otherwise I'd really be dead meat! (Functions is so darn difficult!) And there's a Youth Day celebration tomorrow which I may consider 'ponning' it for the sake of my work.   Suda...I still much work to complete but I'm not too stressed out yet~! I don't really feel the stress of 4As pressing down on me. In fact, doing Economics, Physics and History are quite enjoyable too. I'm in a happy mood when doin' History tutorials, in a somewhat enthusiastic morale to do Economics essays, and a rather "so-so" feeling when completing Physics tutorial~! ;)   I was just wonderin' if there was a way to actually acquire pure nerd-ism in life. I don't think there is such thing as a pure nerd....like for example Andrew from the history class is only probably about eighty...seven percent nerd, and I'm kind of like seventy...nine percent nerd too. I guess pure nerds are hard to find but it's like nirvana if sub-nerds learn to acquire such a status where they are so smart that they can beat anyone in knowledge. 真令人佩服！  Hmmm...here's how to irritate some people by actin' as sissies. Some very irritating sissy quotes are like 'So Bad~~~!', '讨厌~~', 'Aiyah...don't be like that~~~' and 'So bitchy only~!' etc. It's kinda' weird but I like to use them to irritate my relatives. Especially with the first quote which is a super strong word that irritates even the most calm people, unless the calm ones like to use it too.   I guess I've become another saliva reservoir this time. (Looks like K.G. ain't gonna' forgive me for becomin' a saliva cannon on her. History has repeated itself...especially for poor Y.L. from SRJC first 3 months~~!) =P Au Revoir~! さようならございます！
