He was captain of the Uni American Football team this year. "The what......?" I hear you cry. Yes, people do actually play American Football outside of the USA. Apparently it is an infinitely varied sport with a multitude of specialist positions and tactics. However, Stews job is to dress up in more armour than a copper on may-day and sprint forward two metres in a straight line into people. Head first. Repeatedly.  Talking of team sports, Stew had a bit of a result with one of the lovely ladies of Loughborough Uni earlier this year when he earned himself an "assist", if you get what i mean. His partner for the "play" was (Tiny) Dan, (tiny referring to his stature you understand) who is the teams quarterback. Well done lads, you are both fine representatives of the Uni and prove that when the going gets tough the offence and defence are more than happy to work together as a team. Oh yeah, Stew will be contributing to this blog as well. urlLink
