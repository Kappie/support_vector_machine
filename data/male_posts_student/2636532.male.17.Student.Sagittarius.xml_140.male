I went to this artist first thing in the morning on sunday but she was going on her break so i had to wait until she got back. For the next hour i was constantly looking over my shoulder to see when she got back. when she finally did we went over there and Erin immediately struck up a conversation with her while i was trying to figure out what i want. She had suggested that she could draw us as these characters simply because Erin's hair reminded her of Sally. Of course Erin fell in love with this idea and really wanted it. It took two and a half hours to finish, but it was well worth it. urlLink
