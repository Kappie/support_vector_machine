I've never been before, so it was nice.  The only thing was that the popular clique from Midway also decided to show up, so it was rather awkward seeing so many people I know yet am not on comfortable terms with walking through the door.  Chili's was nice, though.  It's hard getting the five of us (along with auxiliary good friends Emily Bivona and Rachel Steely) together, so today was a rare treat.  Tomorrow, we're supposed to be getting our picture taken with Santa Claus.  Exciting, no?  I watched the last three chapters of  Angels in America  Sunday, and they weren't disappointing.  I understood not even half of the message being given, yet it was awe-inspiring just to watch it in all of my incomprehensibility.  Still, I, along with Jenny, am going to be the first in line whenever it comes out on DVD.  It is to me what the Jesus video is like to many die-hard, evangelistic Christians.  Absolutely incredible.  Today, I took the Pre-Cal exam, and it wasn't  too  hard, but I have to say that I did get caught up on about 3 problems, and since it was a 46-question test, I may end up with a "B", which sucks.  However, it's the only "real" final I have to take (I have to go to band and newspaper tomorrow, then take the BCIS exam Friday), so I'm glad it's out of the way.  Finally, Christmas break is here, so I can start doing the things I need and want to do, i.e. find a job, look for scholarships, read  Quinze Ans  and  La casa en Mango Street , work on the Italian, and the other million and one things I have to do.  To end with, I'd like to provide some rather humorous responses to some of the questions I graded for those going for promotion in the Young Marines (I'm the Company Gunnery Sergeant, so I get stuck grading the tests, hehe).  I love little kids.   Q: What should you do when your out camping and you get lost?  A: Stand still and scream.   Q: What does it mean when the flag's flown upside down?  A: United We Stand  Gotta luv kids, hehe.
