It was one of the hardest things i ever had to let sink in. The thought that i couldn't be with him in that way where we cared so much for eachother was almost unbearable. He said that maybe we can have another chance at it after he figures himself out. There's really nothing i can do, but hope that there was a reason for this to happen. I'm the person who can usaully let go with ease. But he was something else, he was someone special, he was someone that could be the love of my life. He had those qualities that i wanted in someone, male or female. The thing that sinked in the most was the fact that the next time i see him, it won't be how i use to see him. Ya i might be able to sway him to go somewhere with me, but i won't see him as much, I won't get phone calls from him like i use to. Another thing that is hard to bare, is that I can't touch him the same way. I might get a friendly hug, but i won't be able to show him affection the way i want to. I can't hug him like i use to, and i won't be able to kiss him, or be able to sit on his lap like i do. It's weird how one week ago, we were together, and then a few short days later, im here at this. He sez that all relationships go through break-ups, i believe that, but what are the chances that me and him can have a second chance. What if he finds someone new? Maybe this is just a road bump in our relationship or am i just a road bump in his life? I shouldn't be taking it so seriously since it was only about a month and a half. But it was a great month. a month of happiness, there were a few arguements. we had one big fight but it was something little where we can see a silver lining. But this was not an arguement, this was a decision he made himself. Maybe it will work out, but chances are it wont.  i will be burning until he returns. Burning with energy, burning with hope, burning with lust, burning with care. I'll be burning. I'll always think about him. I'll hope and I'll pray that we find a way back to where we were, or have a chance to start over.   "So one of these days I won't be afraid of staying with you I hope and I pray Waiting to find a way back to you Cause that's where I'm home?"    "Did I make you nervous? Did I ask for too much?"
