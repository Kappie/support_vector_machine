I've heard being really tired is like being stoned - I guess I just like to see what comes out of my head when I'm in a half-conscious state. I don't really have a clear purpose for this particular post. I was just feeling guilty for not posting on Wednesday, and then only posting once for Thursday. Of course, to me Thursday is today, rather than yesterday, so while to you, I'm writing this today, to me, I'm writing this yesterday ... which is really today, but is actually tomorrow ... to me, that is. This just in: I find it difficult to believe in (or at least find significance in) people speaking tongues. You know, when somebody is supposedly filled with the Holy Spirit and consequently rattles off a bunch of gibberish that nobody understands and can't learn anything from. Something tells me that if God literally spoke through someone, he would make his message clear. I think that it would be easy to fake, anyway. Same with exorcist-style demon bashing. Maybe it's terrible of me to say, but when I hear about people supposedly having these experiences, it sounds like a joke. These things sound like a hoax designed to be 'proof' of spiritual forces and demonic influences. I think a lot of times, some sickos use theatrics to try and get into a position of influence over gullible Christians. But I could be wrong. Then again, I have been tomany church camps, retreats, and mission trips, and I've never seen a demon cast out of someone and I've never heard anyone speak in tongues. Now don't get me wrong, I believe in the existence of demons: I just think that their influences are much more subtle and unseen than is often portrayed. The Enemy thrives on deception and is therefore not going to appear as obviously evil. So vomiting all over the place and talking in strange voices, I think, is closer to lunacy than demon-possession. I think that he would greatly encourage thinking such misconceptions about him ... the more confused we are about his nature, the easier prey we are. As for the speaking in tongues: I don't buy it. Sounds like theatrics to me.
