When riding in the car, I knew we were moving, but the sun and/or moon always stayed in the same place in respects to the car. Not understanding perspectives and such, I assumed that these celestial orbs were moving along in the sky along with me. It didn't really scare me, but made me feel special. I thought out of all the people in the world, these things chose ME to follow. It instilled me with cool. But now I know better.  STAY COOL. ;-/
