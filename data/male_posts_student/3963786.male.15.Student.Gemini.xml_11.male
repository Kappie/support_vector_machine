I started football practice today by the way. I've been wanting to go out for football for the past year, so this year I'm gonna give it a try. Not that I'm totally unathletic, it's just I always played in parks or things like that, never actual organized football. I went to a Football Camp this summer, it was harder than today was so I'm not that worried about this conditioning week. Althought that does not under any circumstances mean that I'm not sore or that I'm not gonna feel this tomorrow. My natural laziness and sloth like habits that I've developed over the summer don't help any either. Waking up at 7:00 is going to be a pain. Practices are from 8:30 to 1:00, that's almost 5 hours for those of you who can't add. I wonder what the hours and days are when we start actual practice. I'm worried about those. I know I shouldn't be, but it's the whole peers watching me thing. I HAVEN'T TALKED TO CORY IN FOREVER. I think I'm going to just call her pretty soon. So later.
