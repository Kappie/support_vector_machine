I fenced Matt Lee and Alex Delaney. From what Martha has told me Matt sucks. Sorry, I don't think Martha would say he sucked, she'd say he wasn't very good. Anyway I fenced him and won 5-2. Now from what I remember, he fenced at PWF for some time and the way they fence epee...He should be nasty. Alex Delaney, I lost but the score was 5-4, I mean I know when you fence sucky people you seem to fence weird but they were just slow and they hesitated to often. It scares me because he's supposed to be our C-strip next year. I plan on fencing epee more often so I can get those fencers faster and more agile. Maybe if can convince them to go through some sabre work with me and my squad.   I think I'm going to buckle down and try to get my team to work harder, well at least my squad. The girls don't need it. I think they will still be ranked no1. Not initially but I know they will be hard to beat. With the most experienced epee squad,the best foilist and definitely the best sabreur. I don't think that boys realize that they really have to work for it. I've told them and the others that one of the problems that we have is that,well, the sophomores have never seen the team lose a dual meet. I've seen it plenty of times. Idris has seen it. But this was back when we were freshman and we didn't care for the team that much. Now I love the team and we will, I repeat, WILL go back to the State Final, even if I have to carry that team all the way up the hill on my back in the rain and sleet. We WILL go back...Even if I have to sacrifice my chances of going to individuals. We will do it-------6:2:1
