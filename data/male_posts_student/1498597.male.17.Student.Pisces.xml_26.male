Of course since I am a day creature,  JR  will have to pick up where I leave off in the night time.  May I mention that  JR  spelled  El Torito  wrong? Ok, sorry   JR  I just had to mention that little fact there....  It was announced on   The Punk Rock Editorial  that I have a new AIM screen name. That is indeed true! My new SN is  WritingDude87 . Some reasons for the change include:  1) The year is 2003 (Certainly NOT 2000) 2) I am no longer running for my school. 3) Did I mention I am not running for my school anymore?  Well, there you go! There is the "official" word about the change. I will now email everyone the change so that they can change their buddylist's accordingly.  Yep, is there anything to mention right at the moment? Oh, that's what! I forgot to note if anyone knows why the title is called "Three Eye Witnesses"?! It was a very special meaning and if you understand the meaning, it will be very humorous!  This is Nick signing off for now...... Stay tuned!
