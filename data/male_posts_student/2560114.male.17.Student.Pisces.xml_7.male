We went to the villanova game against Thatcher, villa lost but guess what...after the game...THEY HAD A FREAKIN 4 SQUARE TOURNAMENT!!!!!...i was amazed that high school ppl still play game famous in the world of elementary school, hehe...meeeeemorrrrrieeeeeeeeeeeeez. Anyways i basically talked to dan about the problems that i had with "the love triangle", but he gave great advice and i thank him for that. Dan can b an ass at times, but he can also b a great person in helping other ppl out and it really helps. Well until next time....stay tuned
