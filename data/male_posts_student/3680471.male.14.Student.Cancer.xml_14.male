Robbie came over (I think all of my posts shall start with this) about 11 and he skateboarded some more(by the way his pics and video section is updated) and well he actually landed it. We were getting on the board and pushin it out from under eachother and it hurt but it was extremely funny. Then me and Robbie went in to play some nintendo 64(oh yeah were old school). We played south park as usual. Jason left today and wont be back for 12 days. That sucks. Robbie leaves Saturday to go to Indianalpolous(or however u spell it) He wont be back till next saturday. Brittany comes back when Robbie leaves. Guess I will have to hang out with her for a week. Worst of all. Maci leaves for the beach tommorow. I wont see her anymore the whole summer, then Im going to High School. So I wont see much of her anymore. This summer rocked now it looks like its ggoing downhill. Anyways. Corey came over and asked out Maci twice hahaa. She said once just jokingly and he kept telling her he loved her. Funniest thing evar lol. Then. Robbie went to the movies, Maci went in, Corey left, So I could only do one thing. Drink gatorade and play basketball till someone came out. Finally about 8:30 Maci and her sisters friend came out sneaking on Danielle and Her Boyfriend. HEHEH. Then Maci came down and some other dude and his Girlfriend and we played 21. The game never ended. All the girls(The dude GF, Maci, and Haley) were on a team and me and the other guy were seprate. We just kept tipping the girls. The other kept tipping me and I just tipped him back. So it never really ended. Anyways that leads me to now and I just heart Kacey and Logans voicemail (lol) Pretty funny girls. Okay well im out. Im really tired
