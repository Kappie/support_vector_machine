       
      I really don't.  I am sick and tired of dealing with relationships.  I don't want to deal with Lisa, Kyle, Kevin, Steph, Renee, etc.  I just wish I could be alone.  I don't want to put up with all the problems caused by relationships.  I hate how I have to watch what I say and to who.  It is really stupid.  *angered groan*  I'm just too tired to deal with all this right now.  Maybe I'll write later when I can think.
