As the dream began, i was riding home on my moped after tkd...( NOTE, this will make no sense for i can only remember parts and will be trying to piece it together as i go)  SO im heading home frmo tkd and for some reason im trying to tow my bike? behind my ped, and i stop in some persons drive way to re attach it...and the first day its all normal...then that day ends...the next day i stop in the drive way and a man comes out and asks me if he can help...i ask him if he has any wire, and he says come wiht me and we go and get some metal hangers....that day ends  the next day i stop by but for some reason go to the door (this part is real scratchy)...and the family has 13 kids...its a father and a step mom, and it turns out that one of the kids was a friend of mine, todd.....  so after that whole thing, i guess my mind was finaly satisfied with that home, so this time after i leave that home i headed off to school...i was on my ped and parked it and saw a bunch of kids doing something on some bleachers outside so i decided i would go chec k it out...  they were on some kind of mini snow board and were trying to gring the railing's, i got one of the boards and did it, then the dream skipped ahead a long time, a few hours, days, who knows...  i was grinding down some super long railing and fell off, and kept falling, and landed in snow...and since it was a mini snow board started going...oddly enough there was a crazy guy with rabies chasing me...blah blah blah my dad pounds on the door i awake...  get out of bed (for real), and walk to the bathroom and there was a frog in the toilet....  blah blah i just butchered my morning, and im getting icked out of the home....later people...
