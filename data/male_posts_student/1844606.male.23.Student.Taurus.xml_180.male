Unspeakable beauty, gleaming emerald eyes and one of the best smiles I've seen in years.  Even her voice is cute, light sounding, kind of questioning, easy on the ears, just as she is on the eyes.   Am I enamored?   Yes.   Is this post emo?   Yes.   Am I drinking a white russian?   You bet your bowlin' ass I am.   I had a beautiful dream this morning.  Its the most disapointed I've been when waking up in over a year.  I'll write it out in more detail when I can think lyrically.
