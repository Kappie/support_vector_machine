This is when you all comment and say "HEY WTF!@#$ I READ IT TOO!"  Yeah, that's just the way it is.  Anyways my day sucked pretty much.  It wasn't too amazing, to put it in simple words.  I finally go the dang script to work for web design.  Now I'm left with almost nothing to do in the class.  I think I'll just use it to do nothing.  The rest of the day was pretty much the same.  Yeah then I got slapped in the ass.  Hrm... yeah.  Ok.  You know who you are.  Woo ya?  Alright.  That sort of thing doesn't happen everyday.  Then I got to world history and acutally focus on work.  I didn't slack off at all.  I got my study guide and started working on it.  I actually worked on it a bit tonight as well.  I'm going to actually study for this test coming up on Friday.  I think I can do pretty good.  I just can't be lazy like I normally am and just wing it.  So yeah that was alright.  6th hour is always easy.  Then had practice after school which was alright.  That's about it.  I got home and did not much.  I played some Yahoo pool with Whit and won a couple.  I actually won a game for Maria since she left her game against Whit.  Then Whit goes and beats me while I'm on an 8 game streak.  Doh!  Thanks a lot.  I was almost up to 1400.  That pisses me off.  I was missing easy shots too.  Dang, I suck.  Speaking of things that suck, just off the top of my head, school sucks.  I'd now like to compare school with the movie,  Office Space .  I think in this analogy I'm Peter Gibbins and Initech is the school, while my parents are my bosses.  Like Peter was saying, it's not like he is lazy, he just doesn't care.  That's like me but I am lazy.  You see.  I care sometimes, but mainly becuase of my parents (the bosses).  Like Peter was saying, his only motivation is to not get fired.  For me, that's not getting yelled at by the parents.  If I get a better grade, not a dang thing happens to me (not anything bad at least).  So the only motivation is to just not get fired.  I don't know if I can go any further with that and plant a virus in the school's mainframe, but yeah it's a thought.  Anyways that's all I got to say about that.  Peace out homie.
