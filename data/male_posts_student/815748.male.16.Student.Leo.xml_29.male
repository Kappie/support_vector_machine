I had lost the Tape, so I had tried to reach Josh Sowalsky unsuccessfully (I called literally 10 Times at varying Times of the Day and on varying Days of the Week!) then I eventually enlisted Jacob Levenfeld (who didn't really help much at all).  I only messed up once, the Part that Jacob didn't know.   -tertiarily-  I suppose I'll go to Tanzania. Barely anyone else I know is going, and, as Bilbo says in Fellowship of the Ring, "I don 't know you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you as well as you deserve." Still, there are some good People.  I don't know what I'll do about the five grand I have to raise, because I happen to have $5,000 in my bank Account that I've been meaning to put into a savings Account.  Oh well; I guess I'll raise what I can, and then use the account Money for the Difference.   -fourthly-  In Model UN, (Go Switzerland, "the land of the Swiss,") we're Mauritania at the New York Conference, and I signed up for SPECPOL (special political Something or Other). It's completely UNnecessary (not really, I just like the Pun).   -fifthly-  Boy (I sure use a lot of Parentheses, don't I? (of course, maybe it's a natural Inclination (myself being a convoluted sentence-writer))).   -sixthly-  I'm reading "Prelude to Foundation."  It's OK, but I haven't been able to read much since last Weekend.  It seems like they've been on this particular Part of the Planet for a really long Time, but maybe that's just because I've been reading more slowly.   -seventhly-  I've decided to become a lingual Purist, using more British Spellings and etymologically correct Styles of Writing (I don't know if I'll start capitalising major Words like they used to a few Centuries ago, though).  By the way, For Your Information, O.K. is short for Oll Korrect, an old Joke by a Newspaper.  Furthermore, the proper Spelling is "Programme" for a television or theatre Show, or anything of the sort besides computer Programs.  -penultimately-  In math, Ms. Green was talking about Great Circles (they go around the poles of the Earth) and in my math Notebook , I wrote, "Great Circle: A really good circle."   -ultimately-  Why does everyone seem to have watched the Super Bowl? Bowling is so boring!
