The game we were playing was a 45 minute stalemate. The general loop was:    Fire artillery, crush enemy attack  Get artillery shot  Counter second half-assed enemy attack with tanks  Attack, have units crushed  Buy more artillery  Fire artillery, crush enemy attack   And so on and so forth. After 45 minutes of this, you're enjoying not losing, but it kind of sucks. Neither team had the skills or the AP (aquisition points) to launch an effective attack. After some more time with this game, I will write you folks a review. Until then,  urlLink give this game a try . It's kind of entertaining, and if you like RTS games it's an excellent way to spend some time.
