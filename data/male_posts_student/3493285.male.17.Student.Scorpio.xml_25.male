BAH neil BAH.  stressful situation #3: i really really miss kara and andrea. simple story, but stressful on the heart.   stressful situation #4: melody left for college yesterday....cant really talk about it without getting worked up.  yea those are the accumalation of my stress right now. and you know, looking at it right now i feel a little bit better. i also keep telling myself ya know "hey..5 years down the road, it wont matter" my aunt always told me that. and it's really true..how many things, honestly, how many things will matter 1..5..10..30 years down the road? few to none will. i dont know. WHEEE!   on the plus side..today = sauvie's island (nude beach perhaps?) and thurs and fri = total relaxation and fun at the beach. wow..summer really knows how balance things out. yay.
