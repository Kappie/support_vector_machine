Well, mostly.    Yesterday I went to the beach.  This means that I have a long two hour or so drive in the car.  In my own little world.  Thinking.  About Matt, mostly.  And I had so many questions I wanted to ask him.  So I wanted to go home as soon as possible.  When I got home, I talked to him about it.    1.)  When we were kissing and you reached down to my crotch.  How far does this go?  Or how far can, will it go?  I was actually a bit dissappointed by his answer but I knew it probably was for the best.  He said that he didn't want to mark us for each other.  Meaning that once we do it with one another, all future engagements will be compared to the first time we had.  And those future engagements will lose meaning.  And he doesn't want that.  He doesn't want that for me or himself.  I argued with him that it won't be so for me.  But in any relationship, it takes two.  And I certainly don't want him to feel bad.  And I don't want to ruin it for him.  Maybe when we're older.  Let's just have fun now.  Not sex.  Just fun.  2.)  What is this exactly?  A summer fling or a relationship?  Are you my boyfriend?   This is actually a serious question.  I didn't know what to think.  I mean, words were exchanged but sometimes we have a way of beating around the bush and not realize it.  I wanted the words in plain english.  Is he my boyfriend?  And as you can tell by my previous post, he was.  This is a relationship.  Which is good.  Because I know what to call him now.  I mean, I won't call him, "So, boyfriend, whats up?" but I know that I am "Taken" and not single anymore.  Which is a good feeling.  3.)  There was a sentence in your Livejournal post about me.  "I mean, I spent so much time thinking about us. Being with him always seemed like it was a possibility."  What did this mean, exactly?  I really liked his answer on this.  He said that he had a mental image once of the two of us in an apartment putting dishes away together.  And that mental image sounds so good.  Its probably immature to say this since I haven't actually started my dating life in this area but I feel the same way.  I could see myself living with him.  For a good deal of my life.  A really good part of my life.    All the other questions were small.  Besides, I can't remember them anyway.  Those three were the big three questions I had.  So I spent most of the thinking of stuff and having those questions burn within me and I spent the other times re-living my memories with him.  My only memories so far.  Of us kissing and feeling.  So vividly.  He smelled and tasted so good.  Sigh.  We then moved on to other topics.  I let him have the mic and get off anything he had in mind.  His parents want to meet me.  Its tough having to lie to our parents about each other.  Its sad that society doesn't accept this.  I really hope it changes someday.  We talked and talked.  And it came as a big surprise for me when the subject turned to sex.  And I thought it would be weird to talk about that with him.  Well, the topic wasn't sex.  It was more phsyical stuff.  I don't know, the subject wasn't on having sex.  It was on sex talk, if that makes sense.  Like, "Do you precum?" and the likes.  And it was great having that conversation.  It makes me at ease.  And it gave me a lot of background information that I can use later.  I know I probably can't control myself the next time I see him knowing the things I know now.  About his body.  It makes me crazy and anxious.    Today, I talked to my parents about him.  And I think they generally, genuinely like him.  More than my other friends.  They said he's nicer.  Which is true.  But they don't know about that.  Haha.  I told them about his ability to speak Japanese and the neat stuff he can do and they were impressed.  They're all for me doing stuff with him.  Like go to Philadelphia and all.  Which is nice.  But I'm not too thrilled that I'm taking the bus to the King of Prussia mall.  I want to drive to his house.  I might try to persuade my parents to let me drive to the King of Prussia mall and park the car there in the shade.  But then I'll just take the car and meet him there, have him park the car and take him to King of Prussia.  Although, if he doesn't like that, then I won't.  Its his call.  He's in command.  Which is so hawt.  He wears boxer briefs.  *swoon*  I can't wait to see him tomorrow, however way I'm getting there.  I am going to be tired going home, I know that.  Sigh.
