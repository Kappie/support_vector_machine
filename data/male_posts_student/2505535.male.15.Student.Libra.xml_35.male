Mark kept hiding his face behind his top hat, he was wearing some sort of silly suit, and fucked up his lines at least 4 times, the best thing was the look of suprise, definately worth the steep Â£5. Most fun, even though we were almost caught using our flash camera, which were strictly banned, hard to be subtle with that, but we ducked out in time as soon as the play ended, some women was looking for us.  Then on saturday I went upto Camden with Alice to meet her friend Lou, also met Charm and Jen there, we spent a good 50 mins in burger king while Alice and Lou went for a "walk." I didn't buy anything there, in Camden everything is either too expensive to buy, or too shit and not worth the money.  And I have proof that my dad is insane. Today he handed out a sheet of paper to the whole family instructing us on when our Rota days for kitchen duty were and what we were expected to do in general around the house, after every bullet point of what we had to do to it said "don't like it? Then go live in another house and be a pig there, not ours" or sometimes "don't like it? Then leave" Which was worrying and also meant me and Dave spent a good 4 hours tidying our room, but at least now it's stupidly tidy, we threw away so much crap, filled about 6/7 big black plastic bin bags from our room and Jon's. It's taking up the whole of the hall.
