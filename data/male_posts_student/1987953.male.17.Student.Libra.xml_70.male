Because of the violent nature of the sickness that I endured, I have a lot of muscle pains from the waist up to the top of my head. (Wow, that wasn't as picturesque as I thought maybe it might be!) The muscles in my chest, back, shoulders, and neck hurt when I breathe.   Anyway, I wanted to let you all know the URL to my commentary on  urlLink  Today's Bible   in case you'd want to read it or at least see that I am starting to make my mark a little bit at a time. It can be found at:  urlLink http://todaysbible.lifewithchrist.org/permalink/3950 .   Well, until I get better, that's all for now!  In Christ, Mike >
