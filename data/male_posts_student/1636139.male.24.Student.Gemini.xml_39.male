He stayed with  Kirill   me for a couple of days until he was able to move into a place of his own. Adam is a big fan of a Smalltalk variant called Squeak so he told me all about it  showed me some kewl stuff that it can be done with it. I tried to run it on  hermod  but it simply refused to start, much to Adam's bewilderment. It's too bad because the Squeak workspace seemed really fascinating.
