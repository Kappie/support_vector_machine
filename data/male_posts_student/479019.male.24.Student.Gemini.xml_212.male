I know I've been bitching about work, but today I realized that I'm really going to miss working at Nielsen. It's been a pretty good year and half. I can't say I've ever been completely miserable at work. In addition to that pretty much all my co-workers are really cool. George is leaving the week before I am for Berkeley and my last day is the 23rd. Samantha is already interviewing for new jobs too. The office is doing some major changes right now...  We also got some new computers at work. 1.8 ghz, DVD/CD-RW, Radeon video card, lots of RAM, etc. I totally need to load some games and shit on there. Samantha is requesting MP3s. We'll see what I can load up in the next few weeks.  In other news, I've got some good plans coming up. Thursday, it's HomeTown with the Posse. Sunday is a movie marathon at good old Spectrum, and Monday is a dinner party with the girls. I'll probably work some good stuff in between those days. It should be fun.  ***
