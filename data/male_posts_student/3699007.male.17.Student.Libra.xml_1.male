I just finished my test and quiz I had today, and they were both easy.  Thank God for chapters 10-12 in Algebra 2.  So, now I'm sitting here listening to Junior Wells.  My playlist is like Isley Brothers>Blind Willie McTell>Junior Wells>Elton John>White Stripes.  How eclectic.  Or maybe I'm a weirdass...hahaha.  I haven't done anything in like a week, I guess because Britt isn't home.  July 4th is this weekend, and I have a small amount of fireworks, so hopefully, I will get to blow a  few  things up.  But it shouldn't be too fun since nobody I know is home.  STILL!  All of my friends have been on vacation for like 3 weeks, it's crazy.  And now Amie is leaving tomorrow and won't be back forever, so yeah...there goes another one.  Oh well, I need to focus on this online class anyway because my grade is...lacking.  Yes, I'm passing, but it needs to be higher.  Damned homework checks.  Looks like we're about to get our daily afternoon deluge outside.  I swear, I'm gonna build a damn ark if this doesn't stop.  And they say we're still in a 7-inch rain defecit.  It must not rain in Clayton County where it's measured.  I am increasingly being told I am very funny.  I really don't like to brag about myself, but I guess I am, to an extent.  It depends on who I'm talking to.  There are definitely a few people who I can joke around with and think I am pretty funny.  If this comes as a complete shock to you, you're not one of these people.  I'd love to do standup someday (hey- it pays damn good), but I am afraid I'd get boo'ed off the stage, which would make me feel like a Tech football player.  I was up early today, so I was in the living room watching (OH KILL ME FOR THIS) The View with my mom.  They had some dude on there singing, he sounded like George Strait, and was actually pretty good, but he had a guitar.  Now, there is an increasing trend in these fabricated boys of the music industry going onstage with a guitar, fretting a single note, and playing it the entire time, if they even play it.  Well, I didn't even see this guy play the guitar once.  Dude, spare yourself the criticism, lose the guitar, focus on writing songs, and be like Ronnie Van Zant.  The man couldn't read or play music to save his life, but he could sing, and made up for it with his singing and songwriting skills.  Ok that was a relatively stupid rant, but it bothered me, so whatever.  Anyway, speaking of guitars, I need to get my sorry ass to Guitar Center and buy strings and dream of owning a Gibson Firebird.  Ok, later y'all.
