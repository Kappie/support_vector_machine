According to the Dean of Students Office, 103 seniors were absent and 18 left early that day.  In all, these 121 students represented 48.4 percent of the senior class. 	Seniors were only allowed to leave school if they had written permission from their parents, or if a parent called the DeanÂ’s Office.  Seniors who missed the entire school day had to have their parents call the school, or their absence would be recorded as unexcused. 	In the 1998-99 school year, however, seniors from the Prep and students from Monsignor Bonner High School got into a fight that drew national attention to the school - including jokes from Howard Stern and David Letterman.  At this year's game it was the players, and not the fans, that got into a fight.  urlLink
