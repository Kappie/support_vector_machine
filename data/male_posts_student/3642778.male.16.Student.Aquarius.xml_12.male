See the point of this "rant" is that this blog is much more effort than I previously thought. It takes a lot of time to think of rants and then a solution to them. Now this is blatantly just a rant that I thought of to complain about rants. The answer to this would be to never rant again, and I don't want to not do that. So I cant solve this rant. Once again my thoughts confuse me. I'm going camping again on Sunday till whenever I don't know. It works out at just over Â£1 for a night so I could be away for a long time. Enjoy your weekend, don't go shooting out the back windows of any cars like the bastards around my area do to me, and yeah. Whatever enjoy trilby
