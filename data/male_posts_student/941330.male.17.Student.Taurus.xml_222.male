[+] poor  urlLink eagles , i know that one hurt, stupid late hit on donovan mcnabb. [+]   urlLink carolina v. new england , i could care less. it feels like florida v. new york for the world series, except carolina has really no charm. [+] i love my new...uhh...second-rate quality article of clothing. [+] it's ok, i really can't do phone calls anyway...sorry... [+] kerry won the  urlLink iowa caucus ! woohoo. considering i hate howard dean. with a passion transcending mortal bounds. same with the multi-genre project. i clump them unceremoniously into their own category of objects on which it would be a waste of energy to poop on. [+] april 14 can't come soon enough. it's during spring break and the finals of fantasy basketball too, whee. [+] anyone wanna watch  urlLink pirates of the caribbean ? [+] happy birthday owen! it's hard to keep track of all of them birthdays. 16 finally eh...it doesn't feel like a big step like 17 does, i would imagine.  new songs:  "so far away" -- staind "someday" -- nickelback "one call away" -- chingy "epiphany" -- staind "badaboom" -- b2k f/fabolous "get it on the floor" -- dmx f/swiss beats "u turn" -- usher
