We left around 1 AM Central time....we had a 9 hour trip ahead of us....I had never been to Kentucky or Ohio before so I was kinda excited just about seeing some new things....I wanted to see the stadiums in Cincinatti....unfortunately the highlight for the trip up for me was seeing an all night skateboarding park in Louisville....I was asleep most of the rest of the way....yes I wussed out....I would wake up and offer random bits of trivia or whatever to give the appearance that I wasn't asleep, but I fooled no one....Anyway we got to Toledo at about 9:30 Eastern time....Toledo was where we were supposed to catch some Ohio state freeway into Sandusky....well we missed our exit and ended up in Michigan for a few seconds (I'd never been there either)....we turned around, ate at Mickey D's (and pretended to leave the Drewski....funny stuff), and had to take the turnpike into Sandusky....  Cedar Point's claim to fame is having the biggest, highest, and scariest roller coasters in the world....as we arrived in Sandusky we pull up over this hill and all of a sudden we see the top of this roller coaster....all of us in the car (Geoff, Drew, Amanda, and I) start tripping....I was completely and totally shook....  So we arrive in the park and make a beeline to the Millinium Force (the one we saw from 5 miles away)....mind you the park has only been open for 17 minutes when we enter the gates....the line for this bad boy is already an hour and fifteen minutes.....the way the line is designed, the ride makes a turn right above/around you....the people seemed to be going at super sonic speeds....but the line is also designed to hide most of the ride from you (strategic trees, tents and awnings for shade, etc.)....so we had absolutely no idea what to expect....all you could tell was that the seats had almost no type of restraint mechanisms....talk about scary....as we approach the loading station we notice that the lift hill is not like typical lift hills....none of the slow click, clack, here-comes-your-doom type thing....it pretty much pulls you up at about twice the speed you normally go up....that was a good thing....if I had to go up that 310 foot steep hill that slowly, I surely wouldn't have rode it....so we get strapped in while they are playing some funky, new age music....and I turn and tell Geoff, "I have no idea why I let them strap me into this thing....what am I doing?"....by the time I was done saying that we were off.....the lift hill while fast, was very steep....I had a sense of impending doom....we reach the top of the hill and then head STRAIGHT DOWN....I mean the angle had to be something over 80 degrees....and we were going FAST....we had a couple of passes over big hills....some sharp turns....some tunnel action....all in all it was the best ride I've ever ridden....  We also rode the Raptor which is sorta like the Bat-Man at Six Flags....a looping ride with the track over your head....the newest ride in the park was a back and forth ride that takes you vertically while supposedly twisting you....the thing about it is, depending on where you sit you may only be twisted on one pass or another....or if you are in the middle you get twisted just a little bit but never enough....it kinda sucked....we went to T.G.I. Fridays and got a bite to eat as well as a few drinks and then took it to the hotel for a nap.....man that nap was just what we needed....we headed back out to the park at about 8....it was much cooler and the lines were shorter....we took out the Magnum XL-200 twice and two wooden roller coasters before heading back to the Millinium Force again....the second time was better....it seemed to go alot faster....  Overall I had alot of fun.....besides the sea-gulls (my arch enemies and a topic for another day) Cedar Point had no flaws....I will return!
