Then went to McDonalds and had a McGriddle meal, pretty good then off to summer school.  After summerschool i had a game but the other team didn't show so we played ourselves.  When i got home i played some more ESPN Basketball.  Went to play in Fremont again... Then went to Pepsi park and played a few games there and held the court till like 9:30 and thenwe left.  Overall pretty good day just went with the flow of things.
