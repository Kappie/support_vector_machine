Now that we are past that happy note, I hope everyone enjoyed the rain today.  When I woke up this morning, I didn't think it was raining that hard, but boy was I wrong.  My car almost drowned when I was following my dad after picking up the rental car today.  Those puddles don't look dangerous, but that's how they get you.  They sneak right up on you, and then its too late!  And I still love the fastest setting for the windshield wipers.  That amount of speed is just not needed, but they are really funny to watch.  If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend it, its a hoot!  because it was raining today, I didn't really do much...well, that's not true.  I had a couple of really good rounds in  urlLink America's Army  this morning and some great rounds of  urlLink Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons  later on in the day.  I also was able to look at some college brochures that had been stacking up on my shelf.  The ones that I looked at today that look especially good were the ones in D.C. like American university, George Washington University, and Georgetown.  I especially liked Georgetown even though it will be extremely hard to get into, for me at least.  They seem to have everything there though, and its right in the city.  Wow, that would be nice.  My sister was pretty bored too today.  So bored in fact that she actually wanted to come with me when I went out for gas.  Talk about bored!  Oh, I guess you will want to know about my escapades down on the Cape on Saturday and Sunday.  Well...I'm not going to tell you, it's my business, not yours.  All I will say is that the fireworks were incredible this year...much better than in previous years.  The smiley faces were a nice touch, but I really enjoyed the ones with the red on top, blue on the bottom, and a white ring around the center.  I was also pleased to see the five-pointed star make its return after a long absence.  My only complaint was that the fireworks overlapped each other a lot.  I wish they would have more time in between or at least fire them at a wider angle so they don't interfere and you can enjoy each one.  I will leave you with this last note: Do yourself a favor and see Spiderman 2.  It just might be the best thing you do for yourself this summer.  If you don't see it, you will regret it for the rest of your life, and then some...its just that good.  Now go away before I get really angry!  Out
