NOTE: If you want to look into these bands, in most cases the below albums are not the best place to start (I have included those). However, they are what I believe to be each band's best work.     1. Pixies -  Trompe le Monde   Pixies are the greatest band ever in the history of the universe. Nirvana, Radiohead, and Weezer have all admitted to ripping them off. They are the wellspring from whence alternative rock sprung. Catchy pop and headache-inducing noise coexist in beautiful peace, forming one of the greatest albums of all time. Start with  Doolittle , though.     2. Pavement -  Wowee Zowee   This one is a grower. You will definitely not like it the first time you listen to it. It feels messy (with eighteen songs that all sound totally different, it's bound to), fractured (a lot of the songs sound incomplete), and sometimes downright amelodic (mostly because of Stephen Malkmus's voice, which sounds as though he's bored out of his mind). But don't give up.  Keep listening . Soon, the genius of this album will hit you. You will realize the songs' true beauty. And you will love this album every bit as much as I do.  Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain  is a better place to start though.     3. Radiohead -  Kid A   Boy, were people mad when this one came out. It was a total reformation of their sound. Their sound barely even qualified as rock anymore, as they were now almost pure electronica. And it was tough to wrap your mind around, with it's unconventional sounds and song structures. But regardless of all that, the music contained herein possesses an icy sort of beauty that is unmatched by any other band. But get  OK Computer  first.    4. Weezer -  Weezer (Blue Album)   This album blew my fucking mind. I had previously dismissed Weezer as typical rock radio fodder due to their terrible hit single "Hash Pipe". And you know what? At the time I was right.  The Green Album , which contained "Hash Pipe", was pure garbage. But a friend told me I should check out their older stuff. And so, I bought a used copy of  Pinkerton . And I liked it. It was good, catchy pop. But it in no way prepared me for the  Blue Album . Rivers Cuomo has a gift for melody like no one else. This album is sweet pop perfection. Every song on here is stunning, and my only wish is that it could be longer (than its scant ten songs in forty-one minutes).      5. The Roots -  Things Fall Apart   Obviously, this won't appeal to you unless you like hip-hop, but for those of you that do, this album is essential. Black Thought and Malik B. are undefeated in terms of lyrical prowess, and the music, which I can only describe as psychedelic jazz, is great. The Roots are truly innovative here, pushing the boundaries of rap music, which they did even more so on the also-recommended  Phrenology . However, I feel this album is better than  Phrenology  due to it's lack of terrible songs like  Phrenology 's "Break You Off".
