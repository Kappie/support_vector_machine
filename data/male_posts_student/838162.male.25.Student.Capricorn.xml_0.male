It’s really been awhile since I have been able to get online during the day, been awhile since I have gotten a day off. Just to refresh, I was given this day off from my part in the ITE Army logistics exhibition a few weeks back.  I know I don’t have to remind most of you, but it is so wonderful to be able to get up as and when I please, to take my time to have breakfast, read the newspapers (still have to touch the Hardcopy from time to time), game for a few rounds, then surf and blog.  I took the off today, a weekday, mainly because this weekend will be a busy one and I will not be spending it at home. I have range that would take place over Sat, Sun and Monday if needed be. It will involve having to stay in in camp (which I usually do not) and thus I will not get to enjoy the weekend. It is quite an important event for it will be my last range before I ORD. Therefore it is important to give a good showing so that they will trust me to be able to shoot if I ever need to do so during the course of the rest of my physical life. I don’t think they have much to worry about. I do believe that I may take up sports shooting as a hobby in the future. On the shooting range is one of the few place that I find that I can slow down these thoughts of mine and actually focus totally on the subject at hand, namely to bring down the target. I am able to do this not because I enjoy it or get a high from firing a gun, but because I fully understand the seriousness of the matter. Guns are deadly. A person with one can kill another person in a single motion. Therefore the moral and motive behind pulling the trigger is important. For us, the Army guys, the motive is to protect and defend our country, family, friends and lastly ourselves. Serious stuff and I’m glad that I can focus totally in this and if the time ever comes to pick it up and do so, I want my skills to able to match my desire to defend.  Will not be able to blog this weekend therefore, so keep the keyboards clean and the Datalines burning. I will touch nodes and check in on all of you when I can.   Peace out.   >
