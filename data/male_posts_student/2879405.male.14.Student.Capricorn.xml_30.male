Now i have no more worries about my IPW whereas the other still have to crack their brains aobut it. Anyway B boys so zai. Beat ACSi, PeiCai, Compassvale to finish off as 2nd in their group to qualify for top 6. Table tennis C boys have gotten a respectable national 4th. Congrats. Badminton also won Montfort 3-2 good score line hahaha. Its all i have to say and...ByE ByE
