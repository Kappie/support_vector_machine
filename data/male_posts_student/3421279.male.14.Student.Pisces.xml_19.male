So go tell all your friends about what you just learnt and spread the love for Avril.  Anyway, if you haven't bought her album, quick get one now!  HURRY!!! As I was saying about posters, you can buy them from www.avril-lavigne.com or if you're from Singapore, go to the HMV at The Heeren Shopson the 3rd floor out side the classical section (if I remember correctly).  Go Crazy about Avril, Fans!
