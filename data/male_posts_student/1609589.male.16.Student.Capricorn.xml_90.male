Apparentally, teenager's brains don't start working until 10:00 in the morning! I WAS RIGHT! I always tell people that I'm never officially awake until 10:30 in the morning, and I was near right all along.  I learned about how when someone tells you something, a little marker is zapped into the brain, and it's not actually learned until you SLEEP, when the marker is turned into a neuron connection in your brain.  Ha ha! Fuck you, hypocrites! Learning actually DOESN'T happen in the classroom, Mr. "I'm so smart i shit my pants im so smart" fuckinheimer!  Reading Rainbow lied to me. KERA in general lied to me. And my teef hurt like hell.
