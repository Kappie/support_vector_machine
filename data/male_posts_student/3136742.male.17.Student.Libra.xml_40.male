There are a surprizing number of people online, namely; Stevie Flakes, Cate, Pode, Wang, Joe Meyer, and Dave... what the fuck are you people doing up?... it's late. go to bed. You must all tell me what sort of evil plans you're working on that are keeping you up into the wee hours of the night. also answer my reworked Bernard Pivot Questionaire (which is nothing like the original Bernard Pivot Questionaire. I'm just tagging his name on to it). Answer what you'd like: -Least favorite social group -favorite 80's song -favorite feature about yourself -you have $88 burning a hole in your pocket. What do you spend it on? - If you could resurrect one historical figure, who would it be? -Which muppet/sessame street character are you? -What is the best old Nickelodeon show? -Favorite celebrity? -Elvis or the Beatles? - What's your most notable sexual kink/fetish?  (I really dont expect a single reply to that)
