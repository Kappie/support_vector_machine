I weekend started off on Saturday morning.  I had to get up at 7:00 AM and leave at 8:00 AM for Red Deer. We arrived in Red Deer around 9:20 but check-in was at 10:00 so we drove around and came back at 10. My McDonalds breakfast was not sitting to well so I was glad to hear the we didn't go onto the surface until 1:00 PM.   As soon as all the players were checked-in , we all went into the commons area and did some team building things. First we had to say our full names with our middle names and so did everyone else. It was easy for the Red Deer players but for us guys from Camrose it was tough because we didn't know everyone's last name.    We all got dressed and went on the surface.  I will have to say that that was the hardest practice that I was ever apart of. It was tough in every way. The heat didn't make it any better either. I was dead and could bearly stand up after that. I will leave that practice at that.   After eating subs we got split into groups and choice a hockey player.  The other groups had to guess our player by asking us questions. Right after a few questions I knew who one of the groups player was but got the ending of the name wrong. Nobody guessed ours but we guessed one groups'.   The next thing that we did was go to the circuit training gym.  I would have tried harder but I thought that the second practice was going to be just as hard as the first so I went light. I really wish they had a gym like that in Camrose.   After some practice we went to Gullivers.  We got the WHL meal which included all you can get bread and salad and a chicken alfrado pasta. It was a really great meal but we never really got alot of bread.   Next we went to the motel.  I won't name the motel but it was supposed to be a resort mtel but in my opinion was pretty bad compared to most of our hockey hotels that we stay in. It had a really nice view to the lake. We had a really good time that night.   On Sunday we had a 20 minute walk followed by the best breakfast i've had for a while.  Itwas a buffet style.  We had some more team building and had an easy practice then went home. It was very fun.  Aside from hockey I plan on blogging more and blogging from que cards so that I know what to blog about.
