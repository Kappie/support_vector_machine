When I saw that he wasn’t there, I bought a Frappuccino, sat down on a sofa chair and waited. After fifteen minutes, the familiar build of Joaquin Valdez walked through Starbucks’ glass doors. He was holding a small blue and orange booklet in his hands. The words One To One were printed on its front. I was staring at the small booklet when he said, “Hey Mikko. How are you?” I said I was fine. “Why don’t we start then?” he said, smiling. He opened the book titled One To One to the first page.                                                  As Joaquin and I went through the pages of the booklet, I felt a sense of guilt going through me like a hot knife through butter. I realized that I wasn’t the Christian I thought I was. I didn’t turn away from sin nor submitted myself to God as was expected of me. It was always about me and not about others. From that moment on, I promised Joaquin and myself that I will commit myself to being the Christian I wanted to be. That very day, I started my true walk with Christ.  this is the second part of my essay...im almost done with my last part...just organizing my thoughts...anyways, im pissed off at mika na...she told me she was gona text me after she finished takin a shower...i was supposed to talk to her about sumthin important...after an hour of waiting, i called her only to find out that she went out with her brother...she didnt even care to text me that she wasnt gona call agad...grrr! asar! ah ewan...im gona try again one last time...if this happens again....i give up....anyways, gtg guys...chill...
