Basically, I fabricated progress so that I have progress to report in my progress report...Gets?  I will be consulting with Dr. Pesigan tomorrow. Period. I have to tell him about my research paper and stuff. Period. Do I have to sell myself out? Nope, absolutely not. I just want him to reach out to me.  I still have to do more of my "desperate measures" plus my Literature 13 report needs attention so I will have to end this post right here...at this very spot!
