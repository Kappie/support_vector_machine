He was going like 20mph! He tumbled and hit his head on the street. Blood was steadily pouring from his head and he was banged up pretty good. We stopped and some lady put a t-shirt around his head. I tried to get the guy to stop moving and quit trying to stand up but he wanted to move. So he kinda crouched there while my friend called 911 from my cell phone. This guys wife and kid pulled up on their moped and went crazy. The kid was balling and the wife was nuts. There was a nice pool of blood on the street next to where his head was. The ambulance came and took him away.It reminded me of my medic days. I think his shoulder or arm had a fracture in it somewhere and he had some head trauma. The was a nice big lump and swelling on the side of his head. When I first saw his head when he was on the ground, I thought that part of it was gone for a second or there was a hole in it. X-rays will tell the story and possibley a MRI for his head. ONe thing is for sure, he will never mess around like that again on a moped without a helmut!  I didn't win crap at the bingo place and it was filled with old hags. I need to do homework and a research paper I have been neglecting, but I will wait until tomorrow I think.
