I had been off to a slow start, but tonight, we put up a Christmas Tree and decorated our apartment while listening to holiday music.  It was really a lot of fun.  I took a few pictures of our tree, and I'll try to get those up here in a day or two.    There's only one thing that would make this holiday season better right now.  (it's not the obvious "gee, I don't have  a girlfriend" answer)
