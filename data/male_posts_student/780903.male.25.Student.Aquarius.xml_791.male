Turn south.  Walk three euros and seven degrees celsius until you find a narrow baguette.  Go three forward, take two back.  There, right in front of you, will be the tallest lightpost in Paris.  Rarely visited (it's criminal!), this attraction is stupendous.  The lightpost is 7 feet tall as compared with the normal 6-feet 9.  Astounding.  Budget 19 hours for this trip.
