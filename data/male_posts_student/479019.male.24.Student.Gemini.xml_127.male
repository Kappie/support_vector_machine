Work was whatever... afterwards I met up with Julia and Naomi and hung out at the Block. We're supposed to meet up with Steff and her friends later. Good stuff.  I realized something today... I want to be more knowledgable about wine. I know beer decently right now. I think I should learn about wine... it's something classy and can make me look cool. Well aside from the vanity thing... I'll know what to drink. Maybe that'll be some reading material on the plane?  Oh yea... I got  Anti-Flag 's  Mobilize  (2002). I finally used my Virgin Records gift card I got for Christmas. So... the CD was pretty much free. It's cool cause it's 2 cds too!  ****
