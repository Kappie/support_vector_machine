I believe there are some necessary corrections that have to be made to the recent article on The Establishment. The first, of course, is about the inaccuracy of the membership of the ALC. I did state in the previous article that the membership is 24, but it is of course incorrect, since unless we expand the ALC it is impossible to achieve such a number since, of course, we only have a maximum of 24 people in the class.  And, yes, there are people who, for some reason, prefer to stay Neutral - with a capital N to denote that they aren't really neutrals - by not joining THE club of the moment. Thus for the mathematically-inclined (or not), the membership of the club is definitely less than the abovementioned number.  So I believe that I have made adequate corrections to my previous article.
