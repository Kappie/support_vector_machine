As I said in an earlier post, you start at the Castle Mountain Junction and haul ass up to radium. That first part is all up hill so, oh yeah, that hot spring is going to be a good friend. They then stuff you full of well-earned food. The next trek is from Radium to Golden. More food in Golden. Then, you drain the tank as you go from Golden back to Castle Mountain. I would say its a pretty good deal, $130.00 for such an experience. One of my rowing coaches, who is also a respected member of the biking community, got me onto this. Cheers Blair. Blair has also biked across Canada which is my long term goal. Dip my back wheel in the Atlantic and ride through all provinces until my front tire is in the Pacific Ocean.
