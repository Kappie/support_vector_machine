Summer has really been boring and fast. Well being busy this whole past month is a main cause to why its going to fast. I know what my schedule is. Its listed below:  1st period: World History with Mr.Balk 2nd period: Geometry with Mrs. Tidwell 3rd period: Journalism II with Mrs. Felton 4th period: Spanish I with Mrs. Jones  Im happy with some of the teachers I got. It seems like it should be a fairly good 18 weeks. Dang..18 weeks. Geez. Anyway. Yesturday, I had a soccer game in Sun City. I play for an Under 17 competitive team. West Citrus Storm. So, we had our season opener. I played horrible, but we ended up winning 4-3. Stats are shown below:   Player:                    Goals:          Assists:        Team:         Assited By:  Ross Rieland                  1                                         WCS Jonathan Livesay          1                      1                  WCS Eric Swanson                 1                                         WCS          Jonathan Livesay Not sure(find out)         1                                         WCS     Total Shots (WCS)      : Total Shots( Brandon):  West Citrus Storm: 1-0                         Next Week Game vs- at Hernando   Summer has been a blast and a bust. This upcoming school year should be a good one
