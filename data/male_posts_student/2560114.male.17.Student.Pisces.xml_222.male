Playoffz...where i all comez down to...where all the hard work in club during the summer and the fall, and all of the beach practices i had...all that is for this moment, the moment where all of this season has led up to. Through our 1st win against s.b., through the battlez wit ventura and san marcos, through our 1st place finish at slo, through our huge battlez wit camarillo...it all comez down to this. Through all of the pain and shit i've been goin through leading up to this season and during the season...this is where i can truly take them out and unleash my fury upon my oppenentz. To me this season is the season of all seasonz, and to me this is the season where we r goin to make history. Win or Lose...im gettin something out of this. If we win C.I.F. this could b a key step to the road to euphoria and this could temporarely fill this emptiness inside of me for at least a year and it would bring pride and respect to our school. If we lose, its gonna feul me so much to wanna go back and win it, to me winning is everything...i hate to lose...trust me...i hate it...and this loss will motivate me and push me even harder to make myself the best player i can be...so either way...im gettin somethin out of it. League championz is fine and dandy...C.I.F. is what i truly want. Every i've played this season, i probly came out with jus 70% or 80% focus...playoffz...its been bumped up to 120%...to much focus can kill a guy...haha..but thats what im at...my last playoff experience was a memorable one...im gonna make this one an even better one...payce.  p.s. - check out "where i store my pictures" at the link column...new picz added
