Yeah then Whit and I went to Mr. Movies and we got Fusion Frenzy the Xbox game.  That was alright.  Not extremely fun but it was amusing.  Then we played NBA Live which I just kicked her ass at.  Woo yeah can't touch this.  Back up off thiss.  Yeah.  Then we watched some NBA games.  Philly beat the Magic and then we watched the beginning of the Laker - Spurs game.  Right now there's a minute left and the Spurs are up by 10.  I wonder how it's going to end.  Probably the Spurts.  Kobe is having a great game but everyone else is just sucking.  That's about it.  Tonight was interesting, to say the least.  Night.
