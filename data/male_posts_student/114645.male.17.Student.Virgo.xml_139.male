We knocked down a concrete wall with sledge hammers. It was fun! Just imagine someone you hate and BINGO! There ya go! Lol. I met Mr. T's son, Karl. He is HOT! Not as hot as Sean, but almost as hot. I was like, DAMN! But then Meghan said he might turn out to look like Mr. T. lol. Oh well. Oh! And he kept like looking at me. It was weird. Meghan thinks he is gay. Oh don't I wish.    So today at school, it was your typical Monday. It went by slow today. I guess because Joe and Meghan weren't there. Meghan's grandpa died, so she went to the funeral. I don't know where Joe was. He might have gone with her. But yea.   So Chesto (principal) took out ALL the soda machines from the cafeteria, and now when we order food we have to give them our student number. Why? I don't know. It will have affects though. Where is the school supposed to get $1500 per month? Not from juice and water sales, I can tell you that. I give Chesto about a month before things are back how they should be. He thought the Student Body got mad when he raised soda's to $1.25. Wait until we relize there is no soda for us to buy. Oh well. Anywho. I suppose I should go. My parental units are home, and my mom will want the computer to write up an offer or something.   OH! Valentine's Day is coming soon. I hate Valentine's Day. Want to know why? I never get anything, nor have anyone to give things to. It is the WORST holiday ever! Everyone is like, OH! I LOVE IT! I hate it. It sucks.
