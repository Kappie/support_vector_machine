I'm finally beginning to feel the excitement building up every time I think about it.  Getting away from Meadville will be  so  nice. If you don't live in a small town, you don't understand the need to get away. There's no one new to meet and nothing new to see. Leaving and returning is refreshing like nothing else is.  As I await my plane's July 28th departure, I'm getting more and more anxious to just take a break from this dull, dismal place engulfed in disgusting weather. I can't wait to step onto the beach and feel the hot sand between my toes. To smell the salty air. To collect sea shells on the shore.  ...But I'll stop carrying on about the pleasures of the exotic state. I feel like I'm writing some disillusioned romance novel or something. And, now, I feel stupid.  Eleven more days... Maybe I'll buy some paperbacks to read on the beach...
