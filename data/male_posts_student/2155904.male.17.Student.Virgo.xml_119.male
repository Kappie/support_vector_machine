Additionally, as Tyke begins this blog he is watching the West Wing but it is a commercial break so he decided to start on it now so as to minimize the time he would have to take after the show is over to blog.  Just multi-tasking is all it is.  1st period there was a quiz today and it wasn't too bad so that is good.  2nd period was 8 minute abs which is fun and beneficial.  3rd period was another day like the previous.  The teacher is really quite mad at the class.  West wing...Ok, that's over now.  Yeah, the teacher is pretty frustrated with Tyke's class.  And man is it ever funny.  She told them today that they are the worst class she has ever had in her 8 years of teaching AP Gov.  Now that just builds the morale of the class, doesn't it?  She had yet another lecture to the class that just said that she was disappointed and that they were immature, etc.  These lectures are getting really old but this one was still funny.  Amed said he wanted to start clapping after her lecture cuz she hates that more than anything.  That would have been hilarious.  Simply hilarious.  Hopefully tomorrow she is back to her old push-over self and doesn't keep trying to get everyone to be on task.  They do have a test though, so probably not.  Then there was 4th period.  It was a boring class for the most part.  But it was only 38 minutes long.  Then they went to lunch at Mickey D's and they left right away so they had a lot of time to eat.  It was really nice.  A pleasant change from the ordinary.  5th and 6th period droned on and passed.  Then so did after school.  Tyke worked on his baller for ESPN and he is really quite good now.  Perfect at blocks as well as 3-ptrs.  Not to mention rebounding.  He is a star now.  Not just a 3-pt shooter.  He is now a star.  Which is cool.  So Tyke had Burger King for dinner and played basketball and the only homework he did was watch West Wing.  Which wasn't actually homework either, just extra credit.  And he still has to write up a review of it or something like that.  But that's about it.  Well, today hardly had anything blogworthy as he mentioned before.  Which is kinda sad.  Oh yeah, Dotti called Tyke after school.  That was a nice unexpected gift.  Always great to hear her voice on the other end.  Boys will be boys (no relevance to any situation, the phrase just popped into Tyke's head now).
