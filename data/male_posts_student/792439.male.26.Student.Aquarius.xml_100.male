DOH! and wouldn't you know it, the  next night when we have tickets to see DAVE ATTELL and LEWIS BLACK, my dear wife accidently trips and falls off of a curb @ work and broke (shattered) her ankle/leg! yikes! thankfully, she is ok. but, sheesh, what did we do to deserve such a fate?  needless to say, i had not slept for over 3 days...speaking of which, it is time to take a serious nap.
