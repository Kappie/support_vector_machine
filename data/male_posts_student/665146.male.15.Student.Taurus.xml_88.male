Now, using your right index finger and thumb, measure the length of your pinky-nail.  Hold it up in the air in front of this article.   That's how much I know about Dick Dale.      For those of you who thought I was about to make a crass joke about one's penis, you should be ashamed of yourself.  Back to my point: I know so very little about Dick Dale, yet I just got  Better Shread than Dead: The Dick Dale Anthology      And it's just completely fucking perfect.  Two CDs, thirty-nine great songs, and thirty-eight chances missed for Quentin Tarantino to find the perfect setting for the music.  Dale even plays the Jewish folksong, Hava Nagila.  As funny as it sounds, Hava Nagila has never been more intense.  Jewish surfers everywhere rejoice.  The entire collection was only about $30 via internet shipping, but comes to about $28 for those shopping in store (for those penny-pinchers out there).  I, of course, played hermit and decided to pay extra for having it shipped over a thousand miles when I could've walked five blocks to buy it myself.  Either way, if you're a fan of surf-music or feel inadequate without knowledge of Dick Dale's craft, then I recommend you buy this masterpiece.
