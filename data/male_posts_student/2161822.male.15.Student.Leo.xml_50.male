So goes life. I can basicaly sum up my day in one word: nothing. Well yesterday I decided to go out to the mall for the first time in about 2 months. Why haven't I been going you ask? Because the mall is pointless, boring, small, and well boring. After going to the same mall since 6th grade every Friday night, you sort of lose interest in walking into the same stores you always do. It is amusing though watching the fake bacon act all tough. How on earth are one of those rent-a-cops supposed to chase someone if the time arose? I mean they barely fit in their already XXL size uniform, are seen eating pretzels/pizza/anything they can get their hands on, and pretending to talk on their Fisher Price walkie talkies. That must be the worst job ever. Anyway, after we were through walking around the mall, we proceeded to go outside and make the long trecherous journey to Gallery of Sound. By masterfully dodging runaway cars, avoiding deep pits of snow, and the amazing feat of not freezing, we were able to successfully make it without too many fatal injuries. Pit stop at K-B first though. Of course we spent about 45 minutes (well not me. I sort of just stood and watched) playing the demo games on the Playstation they have set up. It is quite amusing though watching Joe play Jason in NBA Street Vol 2. Aside from the fact that Jason doesn't know what he's doing, it's fun to watch. On to Gallery of Sound. Nothing exciting at Gallery. Aside from a poster showing a man with the caption "Sorry ladies...I'm gay!", it was pretty boring. I like looking through the used cds in the front of the store. Maybe I'm just a loser (which is probably the universal truth) but I enjoy browsing through cds of various artists who a.)were a one hit wonder, b.)were big stars in the 90s, or c.)who just plain suck (i.e. Chumbawumba). So after Gallery of Sound, we said our prayers and set foot outside once again in hopes of reaching the Ground Round without losing any of our group. When we reached the eating establishment, we were forced to watch a golf tournament. Nothing wrong with a golf tourney, but this one seemed to be strictly focused on that Michelle Wie. The 14 year old-looks like shes 21-golfer who supposedly is better than some of the PGA's top guys. Every time I looked up at the TV, there she was. You swear it was HER tournament. Maybe it was...Oh well. I can care less about golf. So after a "fun filled" night, I can safely conclude that 1. the mall is boring, 2. wear more than a t shirt and a coat when its below 0, and 3. Razorblade Romance rules. Hmm long post today. Funny I started this complaining about how I never have anything to write. I should have said anything GOOD to write. It would have proved it's point with this post. I wonder if anyone really reads this. Oh well. It's nice to just type and type and type until I get carpal tunnel syndrome. But hey, who said life was easy? Ok enough for today. Peace out homies.  Listen to H.I.M.
