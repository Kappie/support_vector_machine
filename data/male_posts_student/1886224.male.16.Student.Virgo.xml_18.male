We then drove to Miami Beach to see another place. Miami is gorgeous. The view, the weather, the girls....its just simply amazing. I posted a pic below of Miami Beach. I got home at around 10:30 last night and had McDonalds for dinner (airplane had shit for food). Today was also my last day of classes and somehow it didn't really feel like it. Just felt like a simple normal day. I have finals all this week and get home at around 12. This is gonna be great. Summer is approaching sooo fast and I can't wait. I also can't wait to go to Robbie's party! Woohoo! Summer 2004!!!!!!!!!
