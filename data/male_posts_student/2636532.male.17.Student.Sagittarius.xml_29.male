Actually lets give you a bit of background info first. As a small child i was told to always look both ways before crossing a street.  And now-a-days they have this little thingy called "Pause Point Proceed" now where in that does it tell you to check.  Most people having common sense will understand that you shoud always look before you walk out on to the road. Except for this one old lady, she stopped, looked straight ahead and pointe across the street, then started walking, giving no head to the car that was coming very fast up on her right. to top it off she was hidden behind a parked van.  fortunately the car stopped in time, but this old lady didn't even know it, she just kept on walking like a heterosexual man would when going by a gay bar. this is bullshit! yes i know that in Alberta the pedestrian has the right of way but, fuck! right of way or no right of way you don't just walk out on a street when there are thousands of pounds a metal rushing about at outrageous speeds. i like Quebec's way of doing it, the car has the right of way. you step out on that street and 5 cars swerve to hit you. and i don't think people here know the meaning of a crosswalk, they just go on the street where ever they want. i think that you should be allowed to hit pedestrians that piss you off. just like... "Fucking person just walked in front of me when i'm driving!" **WHACK** "that'll learn that bastard  to use a crosswalk" of course if they die then they won't be using the cross walk anyway, but if they die that means they won't be walking out in the middle of the road either. -Matt
