I didn't even have to read it to know who it was, I knew by the bright pink AIM theme.  It was Amie and I hadn't talked to her since February.  I'm not going to detail the circumstances surrounding why I hadn't talked to her since then, most of you know anyway, but if you don't, I don't intend to tell you.  Also something nobody knew was that I had missed talking to her very much over the past 4 months.  Evidentely, she felt the same way.  Actually, on a few circumstances, both of us picked the phone up and almost called each other, but then decided not to.  I told her when we stopped talking before that she knew where I would be if she wanted to speak to me again.  I didn't think she would, but suprisingly enough, she did remember that.  So anyway, I talked to her for 3 hours or so and we are officially speaking again.  Most of what we talked about is none of y'all's damned business, but we'll just say she reaffirmed to me that I am definitely her best guy friend and she is definitely my best female friend.  The comfort level talking to her is nowhere near what I have with any other girl other than Ashley (and maybe Blair- if you read this, don't feel bad, you're cool as hell), but Ashley is different somehow.  So hopefully me and Amie are gonna hang out sometime in the next few weeks but since she lives at the gym and constantly goes out of town, who knows when it will be.  Anyway, I just hope I don't regret speaking to her again.  I thought it was nice that she cared enough to think of me and let me know how she felt.  Thank you.  Ok I'm out...later y'all.
