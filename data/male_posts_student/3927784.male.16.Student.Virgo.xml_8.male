I am in real life, but when i get on this computer, i become possessed.  So startin from today, i'll be the new Craig.  Anyway, i was gonna say this even if i was the evil Craig, but i reccomend visiting one of my good friend Martins website.  urlLink  http://groups.msn.com/Frozenhopejukebox   Its a great site, i've just visited it and it is very very kool, so go there now!  With that, i thought i'd steal one of Martins ideas, and write about 'the lads' as the new me.   Martin:  Martin is the greatest friend anyone can have. He is bound to make you laugh one way or another at least once a day. He is entertaining and things arent the same without him around.....he lights up the room, and gets everyone in the right mood. He is good at arranging stuff like going out, and it turns out to be a great night. If you ever need advice, he's the one to go to, or if you say something, he'll have his opinion and make you think twice about it and makes you wonder if its the right thing to do. I've known him since almost the beginning of Colmers, and made school a good reason to go for. I hope to know Martin forever because he is one of my best friends i've ever had. Thank you Martin.   Mark:  Although me and Mark dont seem the best of friends, i can always call him one. He's certainly came out of his shell since we left Colmers, but we did ask for him to change so we can complain. Marks another one i've known since the start of Colmers, and i've known him ever since that, and hopefully a long time after this. You may say his gay, but i say his just friendly.   Ross:  I think the first time we met was in year 7, and over the years our friendship have grown and i wouldnt change that for anything. Ross is a great friend, and he is always there to help, whether it be on money, computers, or college work. I wonder what would of happened if he didnt move to live closer to me. Would we still know him? He likes to arrange nights out, although it can result in being repetitive. At least he trys, and thats what counts because its keeping the group together. Sometimes he gets a bit too big for his boots, but soon realises that and calms down.   Sam:  I've only really gotten closer to Sam since the end of year 11. He hung around but we didnt talk that much until we started walking to and from school. From there, we've communicated through the sound of animals, and since then found out we do actually speak english, so theres no need for the animal talk anymore. His expressions are one of a kind, and i prefer the Sam that sits still and behaves.   Andrew : Great guy, cant find any problems with him. His voices can make you laugh, and what he says. He's one of them people you HAVE to have around, and he usually is. I've known him since year 7, and its not until when we broke up from school since we've started to hang around more. People call him fat, but he only has one chin, and doesnt exactly have a spare tyre round his waist, unlike some people i know.   Jason:  One of the funniest people you meet. Whatever you say will definetly make you laugh. The first time i saw him was in DT in year 7. He didnt really look the funny type, but over the time i got to know him better and i'm glad that we have. When the holidays roll round, you'd think he was dead. When he does make an appearance, its worth him being there. Dont ever change Jas.   Joe:  What can i say about Joe? I'll have to admit, he's not one of the people i'm closest to, but like Ross, i can call him a friend. We dont seem to have a lot in common, but you can count on Joe to have fun. His laugh is great because it brings a smile to my face, and can get involved with things. Him and Sam are a lethal combination, but boys will be boys.  I would go onto  Mike , but i'm not going to. I dont count him as one of the group, just a college mate - someone you see in college and never again until you go back. I cant see him staying with us, and i dont know what will become of him when we leave college next year.  So there you have it, the first day of my being  NICE!  (Almost, anyway)   Until the next time our paths cross,
