Friday: School was neat, during computers we got to make our own game, which I am going to continue to do today and the rest of this week, it's fun stuff. I have to get a few kinks worked out, but I am hoping to get the game to be pretty fun and then eventually I will release it on TD or something.   I watched a debate for a little while after school, then when Chris got home we went to go pick Dominique up from Loard's. (an ice cream store; where she works) We drove up there and it was pretty funny. I can't remember, but I think Dominique fell asleep for a little while. (it's an hour and a half drive) My Nana bought us all McDonalds (and I ate 16 chicken nuggets and a large fry) and we sat around and talked for a while while my Papa watched baseball.  We all went to bed at about 12 in the morn, but since Dominique and I were seperated, I couldn't really talk to her...so guess who did? My mom.  The next morning, Dominique told me they were up until 3 in the morning. No wonder they were all tired.  "Cody Banks: All her classes, isn't that kind of creepy?  CIA Director: Creepy?
