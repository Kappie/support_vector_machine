Stumbled over to the shower and turned it on. I just stood there, leaning on the wall...not thinking about anything at all. When I got out of the shower, I felt a lot better, very much awake and ready for the day. Then, I looked outside and noticed the huge white blanket that had swallowed my car. I bravely stepped outside and was pelted by hundreds of speeding blowing ice shards. My good mood was gone, not to return until the evening.  SATURDAY EVENING:  I decided the roads were too shitty to drive back to Sylvan for a few hours, only to venture back into Red Deer. Bryce and I went to his house, and just chilled on the couch and drank a little. Around 9:30, we took a cab to Boston Pizza for Chantelles 18th birthday. I love 18th birthdays, but I must say, I wouldn't trade mine for anything like that. My birthday was perfect, I wouldn't have it any other way...  Chantelle's boyfriend drove some of us to the bar, and Bryce and I had to fight over who was going to get in the car first. You see, whoever got in first got to mash up aginst the hot chick in the backseat. I won, and I sat beside the hot chick. I bought her and Chantelle a drink later, and starting telling me things, interesting things. I really have known her for a long time. Whenever I've thought or spoke about it, it's always been "I've known her since Rome". It didn't dawn on me until last night actually how long that is. Two and a half years. Wow.  After the bar, Bryce and I found some drunk guys with a free cab fare coupon. We took advantage of the situation and shared a cab with them. I fell asleep almost immediately.  SUNDAY MORNING:  Fell off the couch at around 8am. Got back on it for another hour, and then stumbled over to the bathroom. Did my hair. Tried to wake up Bryce. Left.  I went over the Sacred Heart Church, and brushed my teeth in the parking lot. It was weird to be there. I only knew half of the people, the youth group has changed so much.   SUNDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING:  We came back to Sylvan, and a few people came here. They were bored, I know they were, but I was so tired, I just didn't feel like doing anything. They were free to go whenever they wanted. And they did. Jason at 8:30 or so. Miranda, Eddie and Matt at 11ish, and Nikki at 12. I must apologize to Nikki for my napping, I couldn't help myself. In fact, I should probably still be sleeping, except I fell asleep on the couch, with my computer on my lap. I was awoken at 7 this morning when my mom woke up my brother. I guess that's what I deserve, should have went to my bed instead of the couch.   still, life is good
