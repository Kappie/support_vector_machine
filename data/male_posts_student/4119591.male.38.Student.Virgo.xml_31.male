When my previous contract came to an end, I received a nice, friendly note from the company offering an additional hour of "evening" minutes each day. This offer was being extended ostensibly because I had been a "loyal" customer. What I didn't read (my bad) was that the new plan took away an important feature: free PCS-to-PCS minutes.   About two weeks into the new plan I became aware that each time my wife called me from her Sprint phone we were "dinged" once for every minute she used and again for every minute that I used. In other words, we were essentially billed twice because we were both using our phones. Upon review of my new plan I saw that indeed this is what I had agreed to. (Again, MY BAD.)  After many MANY minutes (free of charge) on the phone with SprintPCS customer service, I was able to broker a deal to return my plan to more-or-less the same agreement I had made originally. I explained that, if they didn't make it "right" again, I would solider on through the end of my agreement and then switch providers no matter what they offered me subsequently. With number portability now the law of the land, I would be taking my number with me as well. In addition, I promised to spend the remaining year of my contract dogging Sprint publicly on my web site, in my blog and in person every chance I got.  They made it "right." Can I recommend Sprint? Not enthusiastically, but I will say that even a few minutes of any potential customer's time is well spent pouring over the fine print. They didn't have to make it "right," but they did -- so they win points for customer service. Next time, I'll read more closely and assume less. "Fool me once, shame on me..."  Dialer beware.  Want to talk about Cable TV companies? I don't. ;-)
