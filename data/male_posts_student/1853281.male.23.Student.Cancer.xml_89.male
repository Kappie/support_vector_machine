I get to walk from campus to downtown so i can work(even though i have to start work late because of the whole walking) and than i have to walk home from work. not that i am complaining....i shall becom a total waifish, nervosa, model type of person....hooray. I shall be at my mothers'for the weekend. Dog sitting, How dreary...with no bus service i am stuck here...i brought homework, music, a collection of MFK Fisher's writings....it is very interesting, and she has a tremendous wit. Finished the book i was reading...the collected letters of nancy mitford and evelyn waugh....they are awefully funny...they make the most viscious fun of their friends and family and eachother....such delicious sarcasm!!!! at any rate cheers d
