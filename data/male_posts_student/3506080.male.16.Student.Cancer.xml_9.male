     
      Once again, I get paid. My tiny little check should pay for my birthday party on Saturday, with maybe enough for me to buy one or two of the classic NES games for GBA. I want to get The Legend of Zelda, and Pac-man. I always loved those games. I do want to try the Ice Climber game too, but I may not have enough money. I already finished getting my dad his father's day present. I made him a CD of Rush songs. If I do have some extra money, I'd also like to get The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures. It looks like a lot of fun from what I've seen, and of course, who can pass up a new Zelda game. Only 4 days until my birthday. WOO-HOO!!! I'll finally be able to get my license. Then I can drive. I'm thinkin' road trip to France. Yeah, I know what I said.
