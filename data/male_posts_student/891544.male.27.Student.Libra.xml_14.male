When I was just south of Post, this suburban pulling a camper flipped right in front of me...  I'll leave it at that and let the suspense build so you will all want me to tell you the story the next time you see me (or something like that).  sad sidenote: I'm addicted to The Sims. even sadder sidenote: I suck at The Sims.
