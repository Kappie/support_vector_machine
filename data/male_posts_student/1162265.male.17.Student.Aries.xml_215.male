It saw Abby walking by, infact we almost walked into each other a corner and we both talked about our fear of the evil history exam, while we both stood shivering.  It's funny how when we were talking, it's like we both wanted to just nod and walk away, but you need to formally break off a conversation.  Funny.  Even more funny, which I realized when I was walking away, is that I was crazy over Abby last year.  Like I really didn't advertise that, but oh man, it was insanity stuff.  Today, I thought about that, before I got into actual crazy relationship crap this year, Sophmore year was all like "I wish I had a girlfriend." and I was all happy despite that since I didn't really have any person I needed to worry about besides myself.  This year, I'm just getting fucked up, to put it nice and square.  Zack was smoking today, and I swear, I inhaled so much of his clove smoke I may as well have lit up a clove myself.  I mean, jeez, I'm getting myself messed up in too short a span of time.
