In order to make sure that I'm putting out content, here's todays content:  urlLink Yankees place 1B Giambi on 15-day DL with sprained ankle .  I can gloat a little bit, right?  Especially when they call up Jose Contreras from the minors on the same day.  Did I mention Tony Clark would be playing first in the meantime?  *glee*
