He got fired from his job as a male prostitute, but it turned out that that didn't really matter anyway because he found the girl he loves being beaten up by her boyfriend and then he too got beaten up by the boyfriend and somehow the presence of an old woman was enough to make the violence stop and the old woman's demand that the boyfriend "leave my house" worked wonders and he was never seen again, and then some old man dies but nobody seems to care, which I thought was horrible, and the girl gets pregnant and then gets shot at a wedding but its only a film but he rescues her anyway, I don't know why, maybe because he spent the whole of the book being a vacuous self-obsessed boring tedious  twat . Anyway, after that festival of shite, I'm now reading...Anne Robinson's autobiography. Nope, I don't learn from my mistakes.  (Edited to add that the prospect of Anne was just too much, so I swappred it for a biography of Dusty Springfield, which I think is much more credible)  Daniel
