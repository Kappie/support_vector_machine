I surfed some Islamic boards and found nothing at all.  If you run into something, let me know.  Same for our EU friends, who were so worked into a frenzy over Abu Ghairb.  If you see some genuine outrage over Berg, let me know.  As for our friends at the DU, they spent the afternoon speculating that Berg was really murdered by the CIA or some other group at the behest of Bush/Cheney.  Various reasons were given: he knew something about the abuse in Abu Ghraib, Bush had it done to change the subject, or Berg was cutting in on Halliburton contracts.  The argument was quite genuine - little hint of sarcasm.  I know you guys get annoyed when I post DU links, but if you want this one, let me know and I'll dig it up today.
