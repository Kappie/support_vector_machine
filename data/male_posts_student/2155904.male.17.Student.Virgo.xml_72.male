Nothing like just hanging out and talking to people.  Tyke just realized that he has done over 50 blogs in his life.  That is a lot.  It could be more than like 70 even.  So he has really been pouring his heart out for a while now.  And it really is rewarding.  The time he puts into this blog is not totally known but he really does try to put his focus on making his life sound somewhat entertaining when it is not and to make it a joy to read.  And from some responses he has been successful.  Today was a good day for Tyke.  Got up around 11 and that was nice.  He watched some football and talked to his parents.  Then he ate and talked online.  Then he left to get tapes for his videocamera at Farget.  That means that he now can do more taping.  Which means he has to get some new ideas for shows or whatever.  The public is anxiously awaiting his next venture!  And so is he actually.  He needs some good ideas (and the MTV Cribs idea needs to be reworked so that it would actually be entertaining).  After getting the tapes he went down to Barnes and Noble to get some extra credit for English.  There was a poetry reading and approximately 45 students or so were there.  All in this little corner of the store.  And some weird poems were presented.  The one with the 'birds in the bog' was good and so was the one about how girls get told how much they are loved by their 'beaus and boyfriends' or something like that.  Mainly because it reminded him of his situation with Tina.  Not that it is really a situation anymore.  But as you can see, he still cannot get her out of his head.  She is a daily subject of conversation for him really.  Amed tried to tell him that he shouldn't spend time agonizing over her.  Well, he isn't 'agonizing' persay anyway but he is just thinking about her.  And really there isn't any other girl that he knows of that he could spend time swooning.  Unless there is some girl withholding information from him.  And that is wrong.  So very wrong.  If this is true (and most likely Tyke thinks it is not) and the girl reads this blog then take this advice.  Find a way to let him know, albeit casually, that you have interest.  Chances are he will show an interest in talking about it.  Actually, he doesn't want to be a "tease" (wow never thought he would be calling himself a tease) so maybe you should just casually let him know of your desire.  One thing that Tyke has worried about is that girls might be scared of him because of how everybody knows about his love for Tina and all.  So they might think that he won't truly care about them.  Well that has bugged him.  He thinks he remembers (although this might have just been a dream cuz one year he had a dream that he got asked to Tolo by this cool girl and he awoke the next day thinking it was true and then at school he realized that it wasn't and that sucked) this one time when in freshman year he believes he was told that Haras might ask him to Tolo and he got pretty excited.  Tyke and Haras never talked about it or anything (in fact they still haven't talked about it so this is the first time...Hey Haras, how ya doing?) but Tyke was just told by one of his friends that she was going to ask him.  Then he later was told by this same friend that she didn't want to ask him cuz Tina was gonna be in their group and she thought that Tyke would just spend the whole time focused on Tina.  That was totally untrue though if Haras thought that (and sorry if this sounds like Haras was being mean cuz she wasn't and she's great and she reads this blog).  But anyway the point is that Tyke focuses on Tina now because that is who he feels deeply for and even though she doesn't show interest in him no other girl has either so there is no need for Tyke to start thinking about a new girl.  Get it?  Got it?  Good.  Ummm...oh yeah the poetry reading.  Well Tyke and Dottie saw each other and walked around B some and just chatted it up like the use (pronounced like luge but it is more like you-ge).  So then they all congregated around the reader and he went to work.  Tyke and Karla sat next to each other and they talked some and that was fun.  Tyke and Dottie texted each other for most of the time though.  It was funny cuz Tyke started talking about having a 4some with Dottie, Purdy, and Tina (ya know usual topics of conversation) and then it started talking about it being a dream.  And then it came to be that it was just a dream with Tyke and Tina.  And he was like, "Whoa I just had a dream two nights ago about Tina."  So that was ironic.  But basically it was just Tyke talking to Dottie about how he wanted to have sex with her and how he was horny and stuff like that (again, usual topics of conversation).  Well Tyke has been rambling a lot again this blog.  Actually you can't really call it rambling when this is pretty much all his blog is.  So now he will call it blogging.  So Tyke has been blogging a lot this blog.  But the blogging parts are sometimes the most entertaining so he can't leave those out.  He basically likes stuff and doesn't like other stuff.  Let's just leave it at that.  But he likes you so don't worry.  Unless you're Kram 2 (he might have initially been Kram 1 but if so he has been demoted to 2 cuz he isn't good) in which case he doesn't like you.  Kram Yarg this is.  Well, actually Tyke still doesn't necessarily not like you.  It is just he hates what you do.  You have something that many people would kill for (Tyke isn't the only one is he? just kidding he wouldn't kill...or would he!?!?!?!  you'll never know!!! MWAHAHAHAHA) and yet you just are an ass to it.  A complete ass.  Balls up and be a real man about it.  Actually no, don't.  You don't deserve Tina.  Tina deserves good.  Oh no, enough of this.  Yet another blogging job done on this blog by Tyke.  He's gonna go eat some more wheat thins, finish talking to Amed and then go to Tyke's bed.  Ahhh Tyke's bed...where all good things go at night, or during the day really.  And by good things he most obviously means_____(leaving ya on your own for this one).
