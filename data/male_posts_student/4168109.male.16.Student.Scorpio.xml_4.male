For some reason, they've called upon  urlLink Kerry  to release his Naval records, which can be found pretty easily right  urlLink here . They also claim that every commanding officer Kerry had in Vietnam "...signed a letter saying he is unfit to be commander-in-chief." Well that would be awful evidence against Kerry, if it were not a  urlLink total fucking lie .          Oh, and yeah, there's also that little piece of information that  none of them actually served with Kerry . Unless by "served with Kerry" you mean...uh..."served in the Vietnam War around the same time Kerry did".          But none of that is even the point, really. That Kerry served in the Vietnam War--that he's a "war hero"--is of no interest to me. In fact, it kind of disgusts me that someone would serve voluntarily in such a shitty war. What I respect about Kerry is that he later went on to protest against it.          Ha! Since nobody gives a shit about the real  urlLink Olympics , why not play  urlLink this  creepy game?               -chuck-     ...or eat limes...
