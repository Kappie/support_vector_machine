But I think I'll start from the beginning of the day first. It's Sunday, so as usual, I would go to church with my siblings. And the message was on 1 Thessalonians. I like speaker (but i don't remember his name) , he spoke in our church before. Since then I already like his messages,a really interesting and funny speaker, and there's still things to learn too. Then he was talking about marriage and sex. Which is what I'm reading in my book now. But really impressed, cause it's a difficult topic to handle and I thot no speaker will address it as clearly as he did. But he didn't spend much time on though, but still impressed. Then after Sunday School, had sub-comm prayer. Our sharing always so crappy one. As in just a group of funny people la...But I missed Music Ministry meeting la. But at least, I got to learn a bit more about piano from Junwen. I have like so many teachers. But it's exciting la...to be able to play.  After that, we ate lunch at Cineleisure with a whole group of YFers. Then we played pool at the rainbow room in Orchard Guild House, while some studied. Of course many were tempted...haha. But we had fun la...even just crapping around and talking. I even managed to get to know more about baptism from Randy. I'm really thinking about it la. But I'm still praying. Maybe I'll go for it end of this year. Then we somehow ended up watching X-men together. Then some of the sisters (even my own sister) got so interested. But Min Er was the hyper one. She even chose the X-men she wanted to be. hehe...then she ended up with Lady Deathstrike. But X-men really cool la. It's until 9.30pm, then we went for dinner at KFC. That's how I reached home so late. At least I didn't get scolded by my parents. Then today, I went to school without finishing my homework. Then stayed back after school with Nat for a while. I'm glad we're getting closer now la. And my father fetched me home. And to my surprised, he asked me what computer game I wanted. Ended up with Lord of the Rings la. But don't think I should play it now. So now I'm home early. Glad that I'm able to catch up with Yen a bit through MSN. Ok...very tired from all the typing. Hope I'll be back tomorrow again.
