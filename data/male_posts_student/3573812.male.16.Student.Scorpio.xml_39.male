The reason:  I'm lazy and I don't feel inspired to write, even though I have been doing stuff.   urlLink Jenny  and  urlLink Rhedyn  are staying the night tonight.  We're having a movie night.  The only movie that I know that we're getting is 'The Craft'.  I love that movie.  It's hardly an accurate representation of witches but it's still really cool.  I should have a shower, do the dishes and tidy my room because Jenny said she would come over at about 3 to drop off her stuff.  She has to work until 8 and Rhedyn's coming over at 7.  I should go and start getting ready.  My room is a tip.  I promise to post again soon.  'Then she was pressing her little proud broken self against his face, as close as she could get, and then they died.'          - Last line of  Alamo Gulch , chapter fourteen of  The Subtle Knife , second book in  His Dark Materials  trilogy by Philip Pullman
