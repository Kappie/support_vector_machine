Soon, I'll be an 8th grader, and I'll finally be able to be free of the devil in disguise, my Social Studies Teacher. I'll give out her name on Friday, along with some thoughts about her. Anyway, my new flash movie  will  be included in the new revamped Gopher's Herald on Wednesday. The WHOLE site will change, because I not only am tired of the layout and old stories, the layout right now sucks. Period. Also, I might be able to recruit another person into the GH. Maybe. Yeah. Oh, and go to  urlLink albinoblacksheep.com ,  urlLink ebaumsworld.com , and  urlLink homestarrunner.com , and definitely  urlLink thegh.tk , 'cause they're cool. Yeah. Totally. Whatayawaidenfor?!?
