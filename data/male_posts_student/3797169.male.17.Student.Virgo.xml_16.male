If you haven't already guessed, the 'Hoe isn't a girl, but I hope she'll be my baby.  So I went for a test drive yesterday in this pristine as fuck '99 Chevy Tahoe. The shit was so nice I almost crapped my pants; I was wearing shorts though, so I got saved.  Anyway. The Tahoe is fuckin amazing, it's jesus, it kicks all ass, it's "heaven on white bread." A '99 Chevy Tahoe 4x4 LT. It's navy blue, with tan leather interior, but not browny tan...it's more light gray. It's got ambulance doors so I'm really likin' the S.W.A.T. look of it. There's nothin' wrong with it except there's a ding in the front bumper, and some stuff sticking to a button on the dash.  I would have to make it even more JESUS tho. Add a 4" lift, some wheels and tires, supercharger and intake, exhaust, and of course...THE SOUNDS!!! Kenwood in-dash DVD player w/ 7" touch screen, dual 12" Sony subs with their own amps, Pioneers with so many drivers you lose count, a Sony sub for the speaks, a Big Red capacitor or two, and a Rockford dual amp kit to wire it all up.  She's a bitch aint she? Yeah, that's why I love her!
