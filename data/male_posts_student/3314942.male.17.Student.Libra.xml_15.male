But this weekend has been incredibly strange and very much enjoyable.   It began on Friday when i went to the Yankees v Mariners game in the Bronx. Our seats were two rows back from teh Mariners dugout. Seated all around us were the funniest hecklers in teh entire world. They began by making fun of the Mariners in general. Slowly, they moved to taunting and tormenting the bat boy. At one point, the bat boy, a kid no more than 15, turns around and screams FUCK YOU at all of us. At that point, we all applaud the batboy for his ballsy, and seemingly hilarious outburst. For the rest of teh game, whenver he would come out we would all scream BATBOY!!!!!!, and we pleaded the manager to let him pitch the rest of the game. the game itself was one of the weirdest i have attended. In the first inning, the Mariners walked 6 men leading the yankees to score 3 runs. Mussina, also, gave up 11 hits, but still managed to hold on to the lead of 9-5. in the 8th inning Suzuki Ichiro hit a foul ball down the third base line, and it was thrown to me by the Bat boy...amazing...its my first foul ball, and Ichiro is my favorite baseball player because of his Samurai like stance and his incredible agility. Overall the game was a blast...it was so much fun, and i couldnt stop laughing the whole time from the hecklers.   So Saturday i wake up at 11 and immediately (because it was hot and sweaty outside) had to go do yardwork. Now yardwork is not something which i am morally opposed to, and im not normally a lazy person, but sometimes i just dont get the point. The grass is going to grow, some people like it at different heights. Rick, likes it to be short, even though he never even spends anytime outside unless he is doing the yardwork to keep it short. So yardwork is a paradox of sorts in my mind. In the end, i always end up doing it because otherwise rick would destroy me. I then proceeded to do random house work and errands till 5, when....  I was to be  chilling with my room-mate from Yale last summer Brian. i hadnt seen him in ages, and it was really awesome. He is going to Harvard ( so i got to make fun of him for it), and we played pool, ate at a ridiculously good Sushi restaraunt Wild Ginger, and eventually hung out with some of his other friends. It was a splendid time, and i realized that i lived just 15 minutes away, so i plan on invading his household much more these days.   The finale to this crazy weekend occurred at Alec's afterprom. Now, i didnt even go to John Jay's Prom so immediately i felt out of place when i showed up. There was no drinking so it was all sober fun. I felt awkward again because i only knew 20%of the people there. But as it dragged on, and we watched the atrocious An American Werewolf in Paris with the stunning Julie Delphi (who?), it became more fun. At about 12 30/1 lots of people left. At this point the lateness got to my head and i began doing the most random things. Animal Planet was left on for a record 4 hours as we watched COlin Mochrie (the guy from Whose Line is it Anyway?) tell us all about animal attakcs. We were up till 5 with Elmers 3d Glue Paints detailing Mountain Dew can's as well as Ian's arms and legs. All together it was completely random.  Sunday= nothing happened  Overall, this weekend has truly rocked. I doubt anyone really cares about my strange and random weekend. But then again, i have the right to write about anything i wish, and you have the right to stop reading what i write. So i say take a stand and make a choice
