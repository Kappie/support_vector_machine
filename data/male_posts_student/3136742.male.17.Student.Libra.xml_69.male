(I'm just going to keep going with the shit below. RAPIDFIRE-- anything and everything that comes to my head) - I have yet to meet anyone who frequents a dictionary as often as I do. - Right now my burps taste like diesel exhaust. - I've never had GOOD sex. I assume zero responsibility for this. - I don't know what I hate more: sleeping or waking up. - Ali G gave the commencement speech for this years graduating class at Harvard. First I was offended. Now I think it was brilliant. I used to hate him... Now I get the guy. - I'm not sure whether I want sex or a relationship now. I know I want a little sex though. That would be nice. - After much practice on this, I can finally say I appreciate almost all music... I still can't stand those contrived soulless bands like Guster though, but they don't count. - I think my parents think I'm gay because I like shoes... I'm not gay... I do look at shoes with the hungry eyes of a young man oogling a porno-mag though, and I've got over 10 pairs, but still... - College: I either want to major in cullinary arts (I know I have the potential to make 90% of all food students look like idiots), or do I want to double major in English and a natural science (I'd love to get into a pure science but I'm not mathematical enough). I know I want to get my doctorate  in at least one thing. I'm not sure what though. - I consider Funk, Soul, and R (the real R, the old shit, not the new "KC and JoJo" bullshit. That's the furthest fucking thing from R)to be one genre, which I would call R I believe it is the most emotional, most human(e) genre of music. It is ubermusik. - Extraterrestrials have been among us so long they should now be considered Terrestrials like us. - I want to use that Veet bladless shaving foam shit for womens' legs on my face. - Internet radio hosted by Live 365â„¢ sucks. - The enemy of my enemy is my ally? The enemy of my enemy is my enemy? - Dick Tracey was more phenominal than Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but I wouldn't say it was exponentially superior. - This is for all you overly sensitive people who seem to get offended by everything: Dyke, Nigger, Fistfuck, Smegmal Toothpaste, your dead grandmothers cunt... coitus.... - If you tell me Bobby McFerrin is not a musician but a vocalist I will stab you in the eye with my index finger. - If I had a pet I'd want somethign that could climb, but not throw it's own feces... A ferret. I'd call him Ferrets Bueller... or a squirrel... I'd name him Django. - I'll admit I got a hardon for a lot of girls at my school. I'm very open about it. Everyone knows about everyone I like, except the one girl I'm absolutely crazy about. It's more than just a crush. I've never said her name to anyone before. I've never talked to her before...I think she knows who she is... I'm a loser. - No, I am ubermensch. - I've lost a total of about 80lbs in the last 2 years, most of it in the last year. I went from 220lbs to 140lbs. I'm technically underweight and I have between 10-16% bodyfat according to the most high tech weight gizmos, but I still have a little fat covering everything up. This pisses me off cause I know I'm ripped as a motherfucker under all that shit. - I am a cardiovascular pussy. It's embarrassing. I can benchpress more than my own weight, squat a refrigerator, do about 70 situps in a minute, but it would probably take me 10+ minutes to run a mile. I have the lungs of a 50 year old smoker. I blame that on catching pneumonia 3-5 times.... and being obese for half my life. - I don't have a thing for fat chicks. I happen to like girls the way they  should  look; no ribs showing, slightly meaty with small-medium sized love handles, like a Reniassance painting.... Slavic (Russians and Poles...) girls hold their fat the best, then Itailain girls. But meaty Italian girls look like a sack of cottage cheese when they get older. - Any guy that doesn't like cunnilingus should reevaluate his sexuality. - we're all a little bit kinky... some moreso than others. - this did not take the direction I wanted it to take. - I swear my mom has the hots for me. - I am Mr. Morning Person, but that's not to say I'm not a night person. I just feel that the day moves too fast if I wake up past 8am. The slower the day feels the more I get done. I seldom wake up before 11 during the summer. - I can screw up a whole months sleep cycle by taking one nap. - My 70+ year old grandfather says he's never had a headache or been stung by a bee. - Ben Folds is the Beatles/Billy Joel of the Me/X Generation. - My english teacher is the most attractive and best teacher I've ever had. I wont call her hot because she isn't, but she happens to have the most attractive personality I've ever encountered and she's intolerably cute. - "Shak" is quoted often in the dictionary. Someone please tell me who Shak is. - In ninth grade I washed my hair less than five times... the whole year... - I've changed (physically, socially, idealistically, and emotionally) more in the last 500 days than most people will ever change in their life. - It's the eye of the tiger... - People who violently shake their heads while listening to fast music (I'm not talking about headbangers here... *shake*-like they're trying to follow the music or something) and people who pretend to be conductors when listening to orchestral/symphonic music are the ones who know the least about what they're listening to. - Messing with another man's automobile is the most chickenshit thing you can do, just ask Vincent Vega. - People who don't like Tarrantino's movies don't understand film. That's all there is to it. - I'm a tea drinker, not a coffee drinker, but I really do enjoy a good cup of coffee. I don't drink coffee because it makes your breath smell like ass. - To have bad breath, IMO, is the highest of all offenses. People who don't brush or floss often piss me off. - The jelly in your eyeball is called vitreous. Those little translucent knots of stringlike stuff you see floating around sometimes are just parts where the vitreous congealed- they're commenly referred to in the optometrical field as "floaters"... I have lots of them... I hate them all. - The vulva is too glorious an organ to allow something so rediculous as penis envy to exist. - nothing I've said so far is the least bit interesting or relevant. I should be shot in the ass for that.  -I should finish the story I was writing  -- Leave a comment. No matter what it is. No matter who you are. I don't really have a reason. Just do it.
