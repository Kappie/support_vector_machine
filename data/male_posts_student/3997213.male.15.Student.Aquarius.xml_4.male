So anyway hotdog day was, ina word, hotdogfull :) or hotdogish or whatever you want to call it. The point is I'm a bit sick of the dogs. Yeah, you knowyou've had enoughwhen the smell of hotdogs stick to your nostrils like... like well I don't have the energy right now to tell you what it's like but it's not pleasent. Give me a break here. It's 12:30 at night (er in the morning) You see my thoughts don't run too well after a certain hour so please excuse me if there are any grammer and spelling "don'ts". ( Alright. I saw Anchorman tonight. Chris, Greg, and I went. Pretty funny movie actually. I laughed my hotdog off (ouch that don't sound right! I wonder where I got that idea from though?! Cough Cough) Excuse me. I laughed my tail off. The movie was really funny!  Oh yeah and how can I forget? I FINISHED JANE EYRE!! About time too Mr. Ryguy... (Darnit I'm talking to myself now...) Wohoo that's enough for me tonight. I think I'm a little over tired. Man do I ever need some sleep. Did I say that I need to get more sleep? Honestly...
