What do you think about making this web log the new "forum" for the Republic of Lavalon?  Post and let us know!  You should be able to click on where it says "Comments" after any post on the web log (this one included) and post your comments, no matter who you are.  (I just set it so you can do this.)  In order to be able to put posts up yourself, you need to go to http://www.blogger.com to get an account, and then you can use the "POST TO THIS SITE" link on the left side of this web log to post.  Zachary Klaas President of Lavalon
