I started to talk about how I had the 'agreement' with the friend to not have sex until we where married and how she broke that agreement. Well, I kinda just stopped talking about it there and moved on. Now I'm gonna finish my though on sex before/after marriage. I know in my mind the right thing to do is wait and have sex after marriage, but I guess in my pants (lol) I keep thinking, well... why wait until marriage, sex is sex no matter when you have it first. I know alot of people say if you wait until you are married it will mean more, but I mean having sex for the first to no matter when is going to be special! It just seems so stupid to me to wait until marriage, but I know that is the right thing to do,I guess I'll just have to wait and see where things go! Something else I mentioned in the letter (and as you might have noticed someone commented on) is the fact that I wanted to and dreamed about graduating at Blackwell! Well the fact is... I'm not going to graduate and Blk I can dream about it all I want, but I'm not going to graduate at Blk, and you know what... I think I'm gonna be ok with that! I mean El Dorado is a great town (Also A Growing Town, Thank God!) and great people live in El Dorado! The one thing that IS going to interesting is the fact that my dad wants me to go to College in Kasnas (He Has A Nice Plan Of How My College Is Going To Go) and when it comes down to it, I don't want to go to college in Kansas. I said in the letter 'Home Is Where The Heart Is' and I love El Dorado I really do, I also love/d Blackwell, but when the fact is 'Home Is Where The Heart Is' and my heart will forever be in small town America Crescent, Oklahoma. My plans for college involve going to School in Oklahoma (Go OU!), but like I said earlier my dad has other plans, but you know what? I'm gonna take 1 year at a time, this is my Freshmen year, so I'm going to go and be a Freshmen, And Kick Some Ass While I'm At It! LOL, If You Can't Tell I'm Getting A Little Excited About Going To High School! Go Class Of 2008!- I Feel Alot Better Now!- Aaron
