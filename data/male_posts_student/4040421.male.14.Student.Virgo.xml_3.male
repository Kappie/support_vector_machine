I think this describes me pretty well, (well, except for the porn bit) but then I wouldn't have minded being Hannibal Lector (Lecter?) either. I think his best line was "I am giving serious thought to eating your wife" which alone is worth a point in my book :D Wanna know what movie villian you are?  urlLink Take t3h Quiz!
