But I would like to comment as violently as possible (which I usually do).   There is no  good job .   Whoa!  How about high-paying jobs?  Cool, adventurous jobs which allows someone to do EXACTLY what he wants at the office, or field?  How about those jobs which help me get a better social, emotional life?  Those jobs which  defines my life ?    I saw this add on Television with the actor-running-president Fernando Poe trying (as hard as he could) to convincingly deliver his platform if he wins precidency.  I was laughing inside, when he promised the viewers  trabahong dekalidad  (meaning, quality jobs).  I thought immediately, what the HECK is he saying?  There is no  quality job .  There can only be quality workers, which may be what we do not have.  Because quality workers (unless any of you would go against) provide quality work-places.  One cannot adopt a JOB to suit the professional -- quite the reverse.  I suppose you may think I'm not qualified to think of this, but I am about to face a reality where jobs are hard to take, and income from regular 8-hourers are a bitch.  My brother is about to resign from his designing job.  He's going to computer-design school, and learn graphic stuff, since one of his friends took a graphic arts job which provides a minimum monthly of 20,000 pesos.  Nice?  But, as one Jap-American guy I've read said, more money doesn't solve the problem.  It doesn't need a genius to figure out that after college, your work doesn't always pay you what you want.  But what is it that one wants?  One million a month for your measly services?  I don't think that is priced fairly.  Of course, there are many ways to get income, like sidelines and investments.  These are actually  the  sources of money, not your dayjob.  College wasn't about learning stuff for your future job, well, until the Industrial Age.  According to Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations", it would be better if each workforce would focus on a task to take in the whole of the industry.  Probably the reason for for college-to-work knowledge is to learn the "specifics" and take a "role" in the company you will enter.  This much is true.  Today.  But unfortunately, there are a  LOT  that a student is missing out if his focus on "getting good grades" is to get a job.  In this way, he/she will fail.  There are a lot to face in the workplace that he hadn't accounted for in college. Getting good grades is a good thing, but not the  smart thing , at least not entirely.  Just because one gets high, doesn't mean he can fly!  The point is, college is so much more than the foundation of your work.  You are suppose to learn much more than that.  Take the technically irrelevant courses offered at school.  Please, you don't need that at work.  But that's because you're thinking about work.  Not what you can learn.  To me, college and work are two different realms, tangent to a few points only.    Harassing aside (if one feels harassed by so much words), I want to tell you guys that college HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR JOB!!!  In fact, you could start a business, with business knowledge without taking that course, and take a different college course altogether. What you get here is, knowledge on a CAREER from college, which you take as a JOB TO ENJOY BECAUSE IT IS YOUR VOCATIONAL EXPERTISE, and earn from a business, sideline, or stock investment(?), because that's the better source of revenue. Jobs, well, they just provide you something to do at day.  Otherwise, one could completely focus on his businesses and just get more and more money.  If money is the only thing in your heart's desire...    College?  Who said college life is peachy?  College is so much more than nerds.  College is an experience. However, one doesn't have to stick to college to learn.  There's alotta learn out there while you work and play along your hard streets.  Insanity it may seem to dismiss college as prologue to work, but it isn't.
