Yesterday night i found out one of my close friends had a guy who didn't want a relationship and was making a big deal about it, the stupid fucktard relationship in ur teens...wow.  Anyways that made me kinda happy b/c girls have the same mind set as me they just want to have fun, use your imagination ppl.  Hardees burgers rock my world #1 no pickels no onions with curls fries and a md.  I have had that order for 5 days now..hmmm.. its like food porn.  My buddy Jon came over Saturday and we did nothing well i played games he watched tv, but the day after we went swimming and it was great I saw a cat.  He left this morning for North Carolina with his three brothers, Stephen and Tom.  Sprint was mad at Tom I think.  thesprint.blogspot.com is his blogger site.    Does anybody like the game called DDR?  Ppl say it is for fags but hell it gives you a work out and its probably the only game that doesn't let you sit on ur ass and eat cookies like i am doing right now....I just went and got the mail and i am all wet, damn clouds.     Today at tennis another girl was there and god damn she is fucking hot.  She has no boobs but i dont care, i dont care about boob size, call me weird and i will say ok.  Her and coach were talking and she commented on how her ex ex ex ex boyfriend wanted to talk with her again, and thus coach said if i would be her boyfriend :/ for the day.  The guy was punier than me and she didn't disagree with coach saying that, i wonder what that means.  She won't be there tomorrow she has to work but she will be there for wednesday through friday :):):):) god i have no life, later. IM going to LiSTEN to my crystal method.  Sprint sprint sprint...sprint
