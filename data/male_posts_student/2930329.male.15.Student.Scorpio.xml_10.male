This drug is supposed to help me consentrate but the only thing it does for me is make me tired,irratable and have an impulsive desire to either fix,learn,obtain,or do things. It's obviusly working because i do have a moment of silence in my sub-consious to were i don't think about random things that don't matter, "good-thing" Ive also been in the chat-rooms and meeting people my own age, Last night i met Emily who is 15 and from Illinois (Lot of corn,I know) and we talk all last night, which was cool cause I have'nt been able to talk to Sheila since Forever, or at least since the last day of school. Another self emploid trait is that i've been watching Adult Swim late at night on cartoon network, Favorite shows are "Aqua teen Hunger force, Family Guy,and Futuram..." Screw that Anime crap, "way to confusing to watch or even try to understand" I also need someone in My life right now... that's all for right now Good-Day...
