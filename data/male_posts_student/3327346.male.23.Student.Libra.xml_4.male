He owns a remodeling company and has not been able to work for the last few weeks because of surgery. He complained how nothing is getting done since he has not been able to supervise various job sites. Is this a realistic situation for most bosses? I said, " why don’t you hire a new crew."  His response was, “it’s just to hard to find good help nowadays”.      That employer raises a good point; do individuals enter their jobs based on the good reason that they want to do work, or do they just want to make money? As supervisors, we need to ask ourselves, must we always be present to make sure a job is getting done?  Obviously, being present all the time is not possible.       I believe that laziness is prevalent throughout the workforce, and it is only becoming worse. Negative energy, just all around negative energy, is contagious and needs to be eliminated from the work environment.  On the other hand a good attitude, positive energy, and motivation are examples that we as administrators should possess and display.   Remember, a good attitude, positive energy and motivation can be contagious and bring about surprisingly good benefits to all.
