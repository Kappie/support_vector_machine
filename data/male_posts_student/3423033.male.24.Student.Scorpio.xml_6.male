Second off, I went to get my haircut today and Jim, the barber, who is an old rock n roller, was listening to this fucking sweet cd. Turns out it is some local guy from Columbus back in the 80's, and it's some of the best stuff I've heard in years. Jim let me borrow the CD, and I have to admit I haven't enjoyed a cd this much since pre-napster. Jim also mentioned that we should jam sometime. I'll put money that I can get a lot of musical inspiration from the guy.  I tried calling NI today but Nora was out. I guess I'll try again on Tuesday.  I'm going off to Portsmouth tonight to visti BWaggz. I guess he has some kind of DJing gig or some shit at a bowling alley. I'll have to go check out to see what that is all about, and yes, I'll be taking the red condom of syphillis.  Catch ya.
