AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!  but i did have my best friend...video games.  yes that right video games.  i really wouldn't call him a best friend, but he keeps me company.  since we have a dvd player in the van i am able to watch or play what ever i want.  so the eight hours was like nothing.  i feel sorry for my mom...i really do.  but i'm having fun, and i'll update you later cause tomorrow i'm going to KINGS ISLAND...DUN DUN DUN!!!!!!
