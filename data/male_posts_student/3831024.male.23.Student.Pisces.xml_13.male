I looked up from the chart and saw yellow eyes. why me? "You are healthy, and that beats lying in bed all day" I focused back on the chart. The kid was only 16. He's dying. and all i could think of was myself and not wanting to be myself. And here he was wishing he was me. i told him i would pray for him. i didnt have to tell him that i wrote in the chart the number of days he had left to live. i am becoming cold.
