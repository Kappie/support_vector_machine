You've asked me twice now As I've stared into your deep wandering eyes "What are you thinking?" While "nothing", was my reply  While the fact of the matter was, was that you were there...  You say your not special That you're plain That you're simple Yet you are everything I want And you're more than I need  So the next time you find me With my eyes strongly fixed to yours Know now what I'm thinking As I feel lucky to even hold you  To have you in my arms As your lips graze against mine To see you still standing there While a soft smile breaks on your face And it all makes me realize how lucky I've become  And the fact is, is that you're here...
