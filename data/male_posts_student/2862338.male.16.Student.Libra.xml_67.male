I know jones thought about the ex-g/f thing to be directed at him, but in reality,  it was just in general, not just at him.  Sorry by the way about anything.  I just really can't understand it, probably cause i haven;t been in a serious relationship, but i mean, i just can;t stand bitching, (and if you didn't notice already, i bitched) and the more i hear about sheel, or whoever broke up like almost 2, 3 months ago, it's just annoying.  So there's that.  About the problems, basically, i just thought of all the bitching i have ever heard that pissed me off (including my own) and juss went with it.  Basically, i got myself pissed off, and typed alot of shit.  If you notice, after like, the first paragraph, my typing slowly gets worse and worse, this is because i was literally typing SOOO damn fast.  I was pissed....but anyway, iadding to that, those problems i "have", well, they weren't the tell all, be all, they were just examples of some.  Jones defenitly has a more real problem, but like david mentioned, and i too, now mention, we all think about our parents dieing, don't matter who you are.  I used to cry at night, thinking what would happen if my parents died.  This was back in like, 5th grade.  So i;m defnitly no stranger.  ANd i think that's the thing about problems.  When it all boils down, we all got the same shit going on.  But anyway, once again, i appologize, especially to jones, because at the time, i was thinking in general, not specifically.  I was pissed....and as many people can tell you i don't get pissed that often, or that easily, so sorry.  It was just....rush of bad thing = rush of rant.....simple as that.  um, hmmm, what else can i say.....ahhh yes, prom.  Prom is in 2 days for me.  Yea, it's on a wendsday, but that's only cause it's a catholic school...and there not schools...plus, it's like there last day of school TOMARROW, it's fucking nuts...but ANYWAY, i'm still pretty nervous.  I mean, above all else, i just want to get it over with.  All this time thinking of what to do, and juss all that shit is getting to me, i juss wanna get it over with, and that's it.  During the prom, were suppose to go to this boat thing in the city, and apperently Czank already went...told me MAD black people on it.  ya, turned me off to the whole idea right there.  I mean, i'm not racist, thats the last thing i'll be, the reason i feel like this is cause, i garuntee, me and my date are going to be the whitest people there....and i'm not even white....i dunno, i guess it's that whole "outa place" thing.  But hey, whatever, atleast i can live to tell my tale!  Speaking of tail,i still have no car. (?) ya, it sucks, but what that meant was we had to walk to messina's, which was awsome.  Today was one of those days you WANT to walk in.  Rob agreed.  Mike and Ben were going to slow to get into the conversation.  anyway, it's funny, cause today, after school ended, he was STILL looking for a ride.  now, i know you guys no t pisses me off, but i don't think i explained why.  it's just....nevermind, fuck it, no need to get into it. it just pisses me off when people don't even try the hard way, ya know? whatever, no need for that.  I need a new profile pic for this blog.  i look like a fucking communist in a AOL chat or something.  I'm also working on a new BIG PIC for the top.  It's gonna be one of those "krew faces of someone else's bodies" thing.  ya, thats all i seem to use photoshop for.  But whatever, maybe one day i'll need it.    um, damn, reading jones' blog was a real buzz kill! this sucks! i wanted to try and be all funny and shit, but i can't! When you write a entry like that, you hope you don't piss anyone else off, but when u do, it sucks!  no matter, i appologized anyway, and that's the end of that.  I didn't even know he felt that! Jone! you should have said something in school! we could have cleared that up in like 3 seconds! that's the problems.  Were all living double lives now.  One, is our regular, good ol' lives, the next is our free speech terminal known as our blogs.  As therepuetic it is, it s better when we acutally discuss the topics in the entrues i think.  i just clears things up further.  kind of like talking with J.R.R. Toilken after reading the LOTR trilogy,  You just end up getting so much more out of it.  Cause i know FOR A FACT i never type out everything that happened, or has to do with a certain topic i'm writing about. So i encourage whoever reads MY blog atleast, to confront me, if i offended you, please tell me, cause more times that not, i didn't mean it.   I got that game Mafia, and thanx to jones, a copy of Hitman 2.  Good games, keeping me busy.  Still have to do english though, and Earth Science, in which i have to IM Shawna about...SHIT! i should do that!  .............................................................  Away message.....perhaps later..   I NEED GYM!!!  I haven;t been to the gym awhile.  And no, i'm not trying to say, i'ma "big", "buff" guy that lives in the gym.  I juist live in the gym, literally.  I love it there.  You get out whatever you have there, really, plus u gain muscle in the process, boosting your personality in the process.    I shaved my chest hair to low.  I was aiming for a minor trim, but on the first go around, i used a size WAY to small, and ended up having to "finish" the job on the rest of my xhest, or else it would have look Retarded.  I didn't shave, that would be kinda wierd, but i just trimmed it to low....close to shave, but not quite.  I need a new screen name 2.  I have this same one for like, 6,7 years now, and it's getting kind of annoying.  No really, it is.  I don't talk to alot of people on my Buddylist anyway, i almost neevr initiate a convo, so i could pull it off.  If you got some sugestions or something, drop the email at Syco10562@hotmail.com (errr...) or leave a comment.    I think i should get a new lisence plate number...as amusing as it may be, i think it comes off kinda gay, and i'm definitly not gay.  I'll think of a new one...  Ok, thats enough for now, got some shit out, did the blog thing, and thats about it.....bye bye bye by eby ebye bybeyebrfefe (......)
