Come down on the street and dance with me   I'm a lot like you so please Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting I think I'd be good for you And you'd be good for me   I asked you to go to the Green Day concert You said you never heard of them How cool is that? So I went to your room and read your diary "Watching grunge leg drop New Jack through a press table" And then my heart stopped: "Listening to Cho Cho San 'fall in love all over again'."   I'm a lot like you so please Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting I think I'd be good for you And you'd be good for me   How stupid is it? I can't talk about it I gotta sing about it And make a record of my heart How stupid is it? Won't you gimme a minute? Just come up to me And say hello to my heart How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too Or maybe you just don't know what to do And maybe you're scared to say "I'm falling for you"   I wish I could get my head outta the sand 'cause I think we'd make a good team And you would keep my fingernails clean But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize 'cause I can't even look in your eyes without shakin' And I ain't fakin' I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon  I'm a lot like you so please Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting I think I'd be good for you And you'd be good for me   Ahh, what a good song! Goodnight!
