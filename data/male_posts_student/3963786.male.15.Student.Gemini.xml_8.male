God that's an ugly word, but I guess that's what group typical profiling would put me in. It just seems to give off such a stereo-typical vibe, you know the one. "OMG, everything is such a big deal, think maybe I could worry more about the miniscule factors in my life that aren't reallya big deal,No! Dawson!" WELL my previous entry would support thatpainted picture. I guess maybe we allhave our moments...Besides being 15,I alsolive in Portville (Saukville andPort Washington have a total population ofaround 15,000, right next to each other, andare pretty much co-dependent on each other, andI think it's incredibly moronic to be making 2 differenttowns, and thus, in my mind at least, Portville was born) My20 year old motherwas in college when she had me and I'm pretty sure that's why she dropped out. I was born in Madison and then my no-longer-college-compatible mother went back to Portville and started to raise our family. I was a really weird kid, I used to do things that would make you think that maybe I should have gone in to see a psychologist. For example, when other boys were buying their hot wheels, I was too.....but instead of driving them around the kitchen floor or making noises with them, I would line them up along the house and tell everyone not to touch them. If they did I would spaz out and be upset. Something else I recently found out is that I used to only color the faces of the people in my coloring books. Nothing else. I wonder if there's some kind of deeper meaning to that? Well anyways, My mom had her second child when I was 3, which would make her somewhere around 22 or 23. Her name is Samantha. From early on we never got along. We actually have footage of me pushing her over when she's trying to walk in her earliest years. To this day I can't look at her without feeling a pit of anger and deep resentment towards her. I don't know why, it's just something about her. I occassionally feel bad about it, but nothing that lasts more than a few minutes. I think it's her suttle manipulative ways that help her get what she wants out of people, very vulturesque. But back to my childhood. We moved around a couple times when I was little, just to different locations in Portville. Not leaving the safe haven my mother came to recognize as home and associate with comfort and security. When I was 4 I met Chris. I still remember the day. I was playing in the sandbox and he came over and asked me if I would be his friend. I said "Sure" and history was made. I still hang out with him to this day. 2 more years passed and it's all a blur of day to day living and nothing really exciting happening. Then my parents divorced when I was 6. I don't really know why, I have some flashes of memories of screams in a lit room with a dark door by some stairs every now and then. I don't know what happened in there, or even if the place existed. But if it did, I'm positive it had something to do with the split. So after the divorce was final we wound up with my mother. My father got visitation rights and we used to go to his camp ground and visit. Eventually we stopped. No explanations. Another year went on and at the end of that the Cards stopped coming, and I didn't really care. I guess that's extremely cold of a 7 year old boy with no father to not care, but I never really asked questions or wondered what happened. I think I was just that ignorant to the world. But then my mom found her old high-school sweetheart and they dated for a while. Eventually it wound up with us moving to florida when I was 8. His name is Steve, and he's cool. He didn't know what the hell to do with 2 kids, but did pretty good neways. He had a decent place down in Florida, not the best location, but it was a good home. We lived in what people here call "The Ghetto" which is funny because most of them haven't even seen one. It isn't as bad as everyone thinks it is. I mean I got out of there alive and hardly disfigured, and this is.....well....me! Sorry, ADD kicked in again, lol. Well yeah, we had some good times in Florida. I was a lot tanner then than I am now. The first year I lived there I went to the school I was SUPPOSED to be going to. It may have been a bit rough around the edges, but I liked it more than the school the Rentals (Parents) made me go to the years that followed. I went from the Golden Ghetto to Preppy City. Did NOT fit in at all. I didn't know how to interact with those rich friggin uptight over-opinionated pricks. But I tried to make the best out of it, made a few friends. But my friends that I liked the most were back in the ghetto. I hung out with a few kids, Junior, Weasel, William, Tevin, Nacho, Mark, Carlos, Kalvin. They were all alright, Junior lived down the street and his realy name was Santiago, He was a little tempered and laughed a lot.Weasel was my neighbor, and the fastest kid I have ever seen in my life. He could keep up with the cars going down our road and he was only 9 or so. I bet he's a top athlete wherever he is by now. William was his brother and he was a fat load, stuttered a bit too. I never really liked him, and I got the feeling no one else did either. He was Weasels brother, so that's why we hung with him. Tevin was just some kid on the other side of the block. I went over to his house a couple times, but i never really knew him. Mark was a kid who was entirely too overweight to be in good health. Red hair and lots of freckles, he got a lot of pokes and jabs about his weight. And I still remember one time when he snapped and tried to kill all of us, he grabbed a pitchfork and was swearing at us and chasing us down the street. I still was a wise-ass and yelled "HE WANTS HIS CHICKEN NUGGETS BAAAACK" We ran for a little bit and eventually he fell behind and disappeared. We didn't really see much of him after that day. Nacho was Juniors brother, and he was older, He was a inspiration to me and my gaming progress. He was a little bit better than me in a few games, and that drove me to better myself. Having been a avid gamer for as long as I can remember, it was nice to find someone who was better than me in something. Carlos and I never really talked, he was more of Nacho's friend. Eventually my mother forbade me to hang out with them, fearing I would give in to bad influences and the lifestyle,and not trusting my decision making. On account of that, I lost all of those guys as my friends. Then I started hanging out with the kid across the street, his name is Joey. He and I became good friends. He is 2 years older than me, but we didn't really care. So we hung out a lot and eventually Joey's mom became good friends with my mother, and Joey's sister became good friends with my sister. Funny how that keeps working out....but he was my best friend for as long as I lived in Florida. My mom married Steve sometime in those Florida years and they had Zoe. Zoe is the coolest kid I have ever seen in my life. She's so smart and funny and fun. She's like the sister I should have had. She's a true Floridian, born in Florida, she can brag about that for the rest of her life. lol. I can tell she's destined for the elite and select few on the top of the social ladder that our schooling systems currently turn a blind eye to. I'm not sure that this is a good thing or not. Knowing how the popular women wind up. But she can do whatever she wants, she had the opporturnity, and the ability. Well after living in Florida for a little while longer, the Rentals decided to move back to Portville. It was around that last year in Florida that Joey's mom developed breast cancer. It hit him pretty hard and he was upset. I was there to help him through it while I was there, and I'm happy I was able to do that at least. Once we moved to Wisconsin I started to make new friends and lost contact with Joey, but I did call a couple of times, including when his mom died. I always feel crappy whenever I think about how we just kind of lost touch. But if I did call him I don't know what I would say. "Hey Joe! I'm sorry for being a complete ass and going back on my word to call all the time. But what's up with you?" I know that eventually I paths will cross again, but until that day I'm just going to have to get over it. Once we moved back here, like I said, I started to make new friends. Brandon was the first one to open up most to me. He kind of showed me the ropes and helped me navigate and get everything settled and introduced me to his friends. I still hung out with Brandon, and to this day I still do, but not on a daily basis. The people he introduced me to that I actually began to hang with are CJ and Travis. Of course I knew a lot more people than just those 3, but I didn't really get to be good friends with them as much. CJ is a huge guy, now about 6ft 5, and about 250, not really that overweight, just big. He's got a great sense of humor. Travis is about 5ft 10 and weighs around 140 and same characteristic traits as CJ, I don't really know how to explain who they are. To me they're just there, CJ and Trav. Well don't think theres no women in this bio. Yes we started to hang out with Lindsay, Ashley, and Stevie. Lindsay was someone who I could relate to at first, she was nice, funny, and just all around a good person. We even went out for like half a day, but I don't even know why we bothered. Ashley and I were never close, she was more of a package deal with Stevie, to be honest Ashley looks a little bit like a rabbit. Right now she's going out with Travis, and I couldn't be happier for him. I don't even know how to explain Stevie. As soon as I saw her I felt something, I didn't know what it was, but later I would come to feel that same thing every second. Only amazingly intensified. I would later find out it was love. I asked her out a week after knowing her, and got shot down horribly. She just never felt the way I did about her.Thats when I realized that love is a bitch. I still loved her....more even. It was with every passing day that I just kept feeling stronger about her.Then Ryan moved here. He is a alright guy sometimes now,and I when I first methim I liked him. He was cool to hang with. But eventually I started to H-A-T-E him. For some reason he had this unexplainable power over the women in our old group. Which then consisted of CJ, Travis, Me, Brandon, Stevie, Ashley, and Lindsay. We would go do things like bowling and movies and hang at peoples houses. Just having fun. But they all started to like Ryan, and no other woman in the school would ever consider him a possibility....at least none of the self respecting women. But eventually Stevie liked him. And he would constantly deny it, and I tried to believe him. He would always flirt with her on the phone for hours and whenever we went to the movies him and her would be flirting and hand holding and it was the small things like that, the things that I wished I could do with Stevie for as long as I could remember, that made me feel like someone had punched me in the stomache and taken a piss on my heart. Everytime they did their thing.But I think that's what started the sudden hatred of Ryan. And right before I started to hate him, I had a dream. Ohhhhh boy, this one involved me and stevie and something slightly sexual, and I told Brandon and he told the women. That got me in sooo much trouble. It freaked them out about me and made them cast me into the "creepy" categories to them. Needless to say that pissed me off and it kind of ruined my chances with Stevie....ever. And right then, that pissed me off beyond belief. Having lost almost all hope, and deciding that I'd rather not watch Ryan and Stevie be all over each other, I left the group. CJ and Trav came with me, they had their own reasons. And as months went by we hung out and had fun, enjoying each others company and laughing. The reasons CJ and Trav left have to do with the women, rather than the guys in the old group. So they still kept in contact with Brandon and Ryan. Eventually I kind of forgave Brandon. Even though, secretly, to this day it still pisses me off. And since I was in desperate attempt to get over stevie, I decided to try and salvage a friendship with Ryan. Now we hang out occassionally, and that includes the women. I still think they're always going to remember that, and will never look at me the same, but I'm over it now. After the whole stevie thing, me and Cory kind of had a thing. We liked each other but never went out. It's mainly because I asked her to a dance and she rejected me, so I went to the dance with someone else and apparently she wanted to see me there, so that thing ended....kind of. Me and her have become really good friends. We can tell each other things that we can't really tell other people. And we have this unlimited flirt thing that is pretty fun. But sometimes we both get scared that we might like each other. She's going out with James, and to be honest, I wish she wasn't. Not because I might like her, but because James is not the right kind of guy for her. He's a player. He's already gotten her to do thing that the old Cory would never have done. I just feel sad when I think about them and how he's going to break her heart. And what he might convince her to do. I just worry about her, I don't want to see her get hurt. She's heard all of these things from other people but it's the truth. We all care about her, and we all don't want her to be manipulated or coaxed into anything she might later regret. She says she's just trying out a different type of guy, but I don't know if it's worth the pain she's going to go through....Now there's Nikki. The one I was talking about earlier. She's Lindsay's cousin and I met her because her and Trav kind of had a thing, but he screwed her over to go out with ashley. And I started to like her. And she started to like me. We have been dating for a while and things have been looking pretty good, that a relationship was eventually going to happen. But then, as you know, I screwed things up. I don't know if things are going to be OK between us, but I wish more than anything that they will be. And I wish more than anything that they wont be. She deserves better than me, and I think she knows it. I don't want to hurt her. But anyways. My mom and Dad are fighting a lot more than they used to, not a good sign. My dad is going through a depression right now, or at least he was. He's getting better than he used to be, but still not in good condition. (When I say Dad I mean my stepfather, I call him that now) He gets a little tipsy sometimes, and a while ago he punched a hole in the TV screen. Our big screen, TV screen. Pissed me off, but I got over it. I got a big TV in my room neways, so I was good. He got a DUI, but the driving restrictions have to be over pretty soon. Now Zoe is 3 years old, and Sam is 12 I think. That's pretty much all I have to say about my life, and my family. I think I'm going to be entering more things in this blog site on a almost daily basis. Or at least I'm going to try to.
