But I just had an urge to post tonight becuase I just stopped by Alanna's lovely blog and found the addresses of three sites with some of the  urlLink happiest  pictures.  urlLink Ever .  urlLink Period .  But then there are those crowds of people who preach against it because they "don't feel right about it" or "don't like gays." That is about the most pitiful statement against gay marriage and homosexuality I have ever heard. "I don't like gays." Because they are different. Well, fuck difference. Those who are paying attention to their goddamn differences don't seem to realize that homosexuals are just as human as heterosexuals, and bisexuals have no right to be left out either. We are human together. We will die of the same worldwide epidemic, and we are all born through the same method of birth, and we all live on the same essential compounds.  What about those who stand around and protest homosexuality because - get this - they don't like the idea of sex between two mala gays. Holy fuck. That is about the most superficial reason ever. The relationship is not about sex, people! It's about bonding, it's about love, it's about being drawn to another person. Any relationship is based on that and only that. The attraction based on sex and appearance is not a relationship; it is pure lust. He who assumes that two gay men are married to fuck each other only makes a mockery of the word love.  And then there are those who base their discrimination and prejudice - that is what it is, and no one can argue it, it is purely the prejudice against the African Americans in a different form - on what? A bible. A fucking bible. A book from 2,000 years ago that no one can actually prove was written by anyone above a drunk man. By all accounts, the "B"ible may have been created by a group of people who made up another way to explain things. Oh, wait, that probably is how it was created. And so we have these people who want homosexuals to die - I'm sorry, people who are different to die - becuase a moldy old book told them to. One cannot prove it was written by God. Just as one cannot prove the sanctity of the Q'uran or the Torah or the Vedic texts. They assume. And they hate because others don't assume. Or others do assume, but they don't assume the same thing. Catch my drift?  I see "Jesus" painted on the shirts of the gay protestors in the pictures. They are following the man, not the principle. Jesus preached, and they are following the religion about Jesus, not the religion of Jesus. Jesus urged unity; he urged strength, he urged faith, but most importantly, he urged unity. And unity should transcend the barriers of sexual preference. Unity does not exclude. Unity does not make exceptions. Unity includes everyone as one, and no one as separate.  Cry the beloved country, that watches as the nation falls apart as humans discriminate and commit the sin of unacceptance and bias. Who will pull it together, when people fight to pull it apart, and the people in power are slipping beneath the regulations to fight on this terrible side (*cough George Fucking W. Bush). Amendment proposal: marriage is the holy joining of a man and a woman. Holy my ass. While Britney Spears is married in the Little White Chapel, activists who pound their fists on reality (hoping it will break) tell us that two people who can actually love are not fit for marriage. Unity. Everyone says it is a dream; it becomes more of one daily.  What are we? One color? One race? One sex? One religion? And as we protest difference, the sands of time and the smoke of war and the ink of prejudice rain upon our heads and gradually make us one color, one race, one nationality, one sex, one religion, one species. One being. One corpse. I am of one place: Earth; of one color: blood; of one race: human; of one sex: we; of one religion: reality; of one species:  Homo sapiens . Of one sexual orientation: polysexual.  Of one being: we who exist on the same planet.
