I just had one today and I think I fell in love, and I don't mean with the class. Shannon had such a great idea about using AIM in class. This is gonna be a blast.  My Jetta's running great now, its badass  100% owning  a car that get so many looks like that thing does. Too bad my job makes me have to wash it all the time if I want to keep it pimpin'. Funny, though, that I'm refining my drive-like-a-maniac skills for as much money as I made at GDT. That's royally fuckin' hilarious. And I get to cruise all afternoon in better towns than we got here, even if you count all the scummy tourist ones.  There's so much more to say, but I'm soooo tired. I'm gonna pop open another beer....   What's on the Soundsystem?  Trick Daddy featuring Big Boi and Cee-Lo,  Dro in the Wind   Drop the top and let the sunshine in With the woodgrain, let the twenties spin Get you a glass, mix the Coke and the Hen' It's quite alright, with the 'dro in the wind, with the 'dro in the wind
