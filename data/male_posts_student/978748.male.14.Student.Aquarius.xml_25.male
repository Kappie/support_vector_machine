First off is steph's and her back yard is like CRAZY. it was better than a hotel resort cause they had like friggin sand and shit and it was like whoa.  Hottub, sand, pool, food, ping pong, ya, u know it kicks ass.  and uhm, I pulled kate into the hottub, but i never got to push jaclyn into the pool.  but least everyone swam and didnt sit around all self concious and being stupid and stuff.  so after that, we go to jamies party, but it's just stefan, dirk, dre, and I from our school cause everyone else went to watch a movie.  ATTENTION: PARTIES ARE BETTER THAN FUCKING MOVIES. M'KAY!  so yeah, it was fun.  Paige taught me how to freak lol, i suck at, but it still made me feel so much .... less asian.
