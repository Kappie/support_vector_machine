My family consists of 5 members: me, my mum Brenda, my dad Gavin, my 12 year old brother Sam (who is the most annoying boy ever) and my sister (who does not want to be named)  I used to come from England but emigrated in 1996 to Perth. Since then I have been to two schools:  - St. Andrews Grammar (a greek school) where I was there since 1996-2002 (from year 1 to Year 7). I loved that school, the kids there were so nice as well as the teachers where they were so easy to get along and I got a great education. At the end of the year, there is an awards night and I got 7 awards (6 for academic excellence {6 years in a row} and citizenship). I'm sure some of the other smart people were glad for me to go as they wanted an award but anyway. I moved after year 7 because my mum wanted me to have the best facilities (I later learnt that a school is all about quality not quantity). On my last day I was extremely sad and didn't want to leave but eventually i pulled away.  - John Septimus Roe Anglican Community School is my current school. I joined last year (2003). On my first day I was extremely nervous however I did know a few people there so that helped (Around three people from my old school were suppose to go to JSR as well but they pulled out at the last minute). Some of the teachers are good but some are the worst and I came away learning minimal (My engish teacher last year was not fantastic last year so blame him if i make some grammatical errors). I've made some good friends but some people are not very nice. I am looking forward to the future whether it will be a good or a bad ending to my schooling.  Well that is me, josh2803 and wait to see the next posts i create.
