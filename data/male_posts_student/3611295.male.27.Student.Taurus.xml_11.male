Two groups were formed and tried to take on the world, but only with each other were they strong!!! It seems this group may be heading to that path. All i have to say is practive your dance moves cause ITS ON!!!! If only Mr. Rad were here to fix everyting for us.  Also, on another note, it seems that not only does al flake because he stays up until the wee hours of the morning, but it seems that maybe were just not fun enough for him. A conversation was overheard today with Tim about going to vegas saturday to sunday, and Al was all for it right away!!!! So when the Gupps wanna hang out, its if he feels like it, but when a friend wants to go to vegas you cant stop him. Is it us Al????
