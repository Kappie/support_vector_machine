As usual, reported for work at 1745, found out that yong feng was on off yesterday. So no choice, couldnt get the PLU code that he promised to give us..  Was given a counter at B2, which was mostly all the electrical items, and was asked to open the express counter, which is only for customers who buys less than 10 items.  At the end of the day, when i was asked to close counter and count the money, i was the last to finish counting as got some problem . lets hope that tomolo would not have much problem again, lucky for me that there was no extra or less of cash.  Then today, i had food knowledge test, followed by POC, today we learnt two menu, one for tomolo and the other for tues, as monday is a public holiday so there wouldnt be any class.  Well, think that's all for nw. till then. Cheers Thomas
