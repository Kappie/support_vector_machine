All is well in the land of the Kiebler Elves. We have 6 songs lined up to play. This is a show without drums which is so not our style but its still really fun as it is. The songs go as follows: 1)Red House -Jimi Hendrix 2)Layla (Unplugged) -Eric Clapton 3)Castles Made of Sand/Little Wing Medley 4)Pride and Joy -Stevie Ray Vaughan 5)Empty Arms -Stevie Ray Vaughan  6)Villanova Junction -Jimi Hendrix  Those are the songs. Which is gonna make it sooo cool. Those are some of the best songs to play at an all acoustic show. I cant wait for it.
