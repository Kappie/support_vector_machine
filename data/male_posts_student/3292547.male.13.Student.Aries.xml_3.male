Then you can ask questions! Wahoo!!  I asked her to the dance. (Her - the girl I like. Yeah, it was posted a while back, I'm not sure if I deleted the post. I went mad. Don't ask, just read below). She said yes if she could. If she could? What the heck does that mean!? Now, as even though I'm feared she's reading this. (AHHHH!) I'm thinking of asking her out there.  That's it. There. I said it. Happy now?
