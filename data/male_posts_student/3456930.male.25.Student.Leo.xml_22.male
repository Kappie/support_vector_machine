Unfortunately, it did something to my password which has then made it not let me into my own blog!! Support tried to help me and it worked for a bit and then all today it wouldn't let me in again. Now it seems to be working again... fuck me gently with a chainsaw!  Make up your friggin' mind!!   Lowman X, out.   "Spinnin' outta control, outta control!! I'm spinnin' outta control, outta control!!"  Hoobastank - 'Out of Control'
