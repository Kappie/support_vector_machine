I guess i am excited....It's just that fact that I am growing older i guess.....cause I don't get as excited as I used to...  Montana used to be the only thing that would save me from the real world........ But now a days.....Now that I am 15, It just isn't the same anymore.... Everyone is busy up their.....   It used to be so much fun......But now it gets kinda boring...... I don't have any of my video games(except my GBA SP), and i don't have a computer..... I have T.v. but that gets boring after a While.... And the whole time I am up their, I usually am working, trying to help my grandparents do Yardwork!  Don't get me wrong...I like to help my grandparents, now that they are getting older and can't do as much, but seriously...... It gets frustrating after a while.  I guess the Moral of this Post is that i am growing up more........ AND IT SUCKS!!!! Is anyone else going through the same thing that I am?!?  Oh BTW, I get lonely too, because everyone is working, including my brother and cousin..  Even here in TX, everyone is always busy....  I wish I could just talk to someone who actually cared.    I wish I could have someone who would always be around and hang out with me.....  I wish .....I had a girlfriend....  Sigh.........................................................
