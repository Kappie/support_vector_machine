I guess it's all good because I'll get lots of money, and work isn't THAT bad, but it's just the idea.       In Other News..    I'll be putting my full site up soon, check out the old version at :   urlLink  http://www.diztorted-reality.tk    (sign up for the forum now, and maybe get  admin  or  moderator !)
