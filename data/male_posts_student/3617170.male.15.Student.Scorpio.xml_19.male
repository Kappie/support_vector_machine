It's pretty good so far, and if you know what a T-34 or Tiger Mark IV is, you should check it out.  Aside from that, Burger King's Angus Burger is pretty good, if you like your food to taste like crap. At first it was ok, but then I realized I was expecting something more along the lines of food, not crap.
