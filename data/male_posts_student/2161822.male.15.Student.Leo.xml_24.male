Then every so often we would get in groups and do "fun stuff" like drawing on puzzle pieces or discussing why we are like the apostles. Then we all gathered to have mass before finally going home. We all concluded at the end of the day that our class has no unity and are a bunch of lazy morons who don't get involved. We're supposed to "change" but I think we all know how that will work. The drive back to Hafey was one of the most frightening experiences I have ever had. You see, our bus driver was looking at everything BUT the road. Scary looking up to see the bus driver having a nice conversation with the person in the front seat and occasionally taking his hands off the wheel to fix his hair/mustache/hat. Interesting and scary at the same time. End of post. Listen to H.I.M.
