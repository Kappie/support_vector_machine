Great friends such as Rayhan, Brian, Jeffrey, Kira, Alex, and many more people have helped me greatly and I am forever in their debt.  Now though it feels like everyone is starting to hook up and I just feel alone. It is no fault of theirs, do not get the wrong idea from this I am happy for them. Heck I envy them in some sense. When it comes to stuff like that I fall over my own two feet. I just don't know what to do and I don't know how to say this to anyone. (you should see what mental hoops I'm going through to write this here)  I know i need to be more outgoing a bit cooler and maybe a lot more confident and a helluva lot less passive.but as it is right now especially after seeing so many people hook up makes me feel well like a loser. I feel like I'm a 3rd wheel (5th wheel?)  in groups.  I guess knowing what I need to improve is the first step to improving myself but how? their are no how-to books for stuff like this (or at least none that I would trust) I guess I just have to look at myself more and just keep looking
