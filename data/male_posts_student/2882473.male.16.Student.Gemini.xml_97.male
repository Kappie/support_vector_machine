(That's a metamophorical thingy Mr 'Oh Boyyyyys' Herbert went on about, actually refering to my life). Now I come to think of it, I can't really remember. Now, not remembering where you have been for a whole day could be a sign of being totally messed up on drugs and drink, but most of my readers know that I would never do such a heathen thing. Tis bad for the liver. :) I think I just played a bit on the computer, did a bit o' reading, learnt a bit o' Esperanto, and generally just hanging around the house. However, I did watch 'Police Academy 2', a rather good film, and a sequal to 'Police Academy' (no prizes for guessing that). Twas quite funny, with some great characters.  Well, today was slightly more interestng, being as although in the morning I did not much more than play on the computer, in the afternoon I did something I haven't done in a long long time. And that was.... Play golf. What a great game it is. I went with my sister and my dad, for a round of 9 holes at some place called 'Sparrows Den', in West Wickham I think. I lost, unfortunately, with sister comming second and dad comming first, with scores of 51, 45 and 44. So I wasn't so far behind. And we had an ice cream after, which made up for the dissapointment of losing. And I'm certainly bette than last time I played. It's quite a good game, the duds should go together at some point, and make another outing for the summer's dud-a-thon.  Oh, and I lost a game of chess to level 1 on the chess computer, which was rather embarresing, but meh. Practice will prevail. Hopefully.  And finally, this is a rather good quote from 'Reaper Man' that I'm reading at the moment: 'The Bursar thought he was anorexic, as everytime he looked in the mirror he saw a fat man looking back at him. It was the Archchancellor standing behnind him, yelling at him'  Anywho, bye for now   Weather:  Cloudy, sunny, overcast  Reading:  Reaper Man  Listening to:  'Good Stuff' - Prince Ali in some weid language...  Watching:  Police Academy 2  Confused about:  Nowt really, with school work over with  Annoyed with:  Losing golf and chess in one day  Mood:  Fairly good
