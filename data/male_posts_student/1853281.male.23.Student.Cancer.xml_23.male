Our waitress looked like she had been with the place since it opened, and smelled like nursing home. I had a patty melt, peach cobbler, coffee, and talked politics and the economy with a friend. I am oficially 40. I don't know what to think about school except that i am busy and i like all but one of my classes. It's allready the second week, and i have not developed any obsessive crushes, and i have actually been doing my homework. I must be growing up. I did ditch my first class of the school year, though. I had to. I can't stand this class, but can't drop it either. It's a huge class, and he does not take attendance. I do the readings, Fine, I'll go next time!!! (Can you tell i feel guilty, though not too much as i could not have had said lunch if i had not ditched. Well, back to work, and the glorious world of a paper monkey
