But despite knowing this you still spent time finding it so if you read some stuff then its really all your fault.  Although it may seem like i have written it and then published it for the people of the world to read, it is in fact, still your fault.  Dont think there is anything on here that refers to you in anything other than your first name anyway.  And not very much of it is that embarrasing to you.  It is not a shadow on your deep seated unhealthy obsession about Ella Corbin of cheltenham bournside school, cheltenham, england, uk.  Neither does it go into any great detail about your hobby of dressing up as a generic wizard for the Harry Potter book launch last summer: a fact made all the more embarrasing due to you being a 16 year old, in town, at midnight, reading a childrens book, alone.   As a general bit of information for rob and all readers: if you havent figured out by now, this blog contains no in depth detail about the life, inner thoughts, or aspirations of mmcevoy.  It's really just something i write, about anything (and as you will find out, absolutely anything).  So to just make that clear to you rob, there is nothing embarrasing about ME here.  It is a different matter for you however.  I understand that some people feel that the whole interest in a blog is the personal touches that mean you can find out someones deepest thoughts and longings when you dont know them at all.  However, as is now apparent due to people i know  finding this site, i'm glad that i always chose not to do that.  It really is suicide.  My blog is fun the way it is anyway.  isnt it?  fun fun FUN.  keep repeating it till its true.
