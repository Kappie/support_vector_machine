It would have been unremarkable if not for a trip we took while on the Island.  Idris' dad is a Greek, Omega Psi Phi, and saw another brother (in two ways).  So he got invited to a barbeque at his house.  Dad dropped him off we went about our business, we come back to pick Mr. Evans up and ended up staying awhile ourselves.  Naturally everyone was talking to me about college.  This one guy who was trying to convince my mom to move out to Somerset so more black people would be out there, had went to Rutgers and then UC: Berkley for gradschool. He was talking about Rutgers.  Then this other lady, who was a Delta (the Delta call is great stuff), started talking about Howard, and she seriously got me to reconsider it again.   For those who don't know I've been batting this school around since mid-10th grade, and had said no to it for awhile.  She comes along and proves all my misconceptions wrong about it.  So.... hell, if they have elementry education (what black school wouldn't?) as a major, I'd definitely go there.    She had one really good point.  She said, if you don't go to a black school you are going to struggle to fit in, and your going to be overly concerned with what the people you hang out with look like.  She said that doesn't happen so much at Howard, and you can focus on actually knowing people.  That selling point rang pretty true, and hell, Great-Grandpa Robinson (or was it Chislom?) went there.
