Teenagers have this insane tendency to repress a lot of emotions when they have a crush on somebody, and consequently they treat it like a secret. Why? It makes no sense to me. Being attracted to someone shouldn't be a secret and it's certainly nothing to be ashamed of. I mean, people get so concerned that they're going to ruin a friendship if they tell the person that they  like  them ... if that's going to cause the person to freak out and not associate with you, they're probably an asshole anyway. It's a good way to test if that friendship you're talking about is such a great thing. If it can't survive a few hormones, it wasn't so great after all, now was it? This being the case, I'm thinking about revising my new strategy toward girls. If I do develop a crush on somebody, I will tellher at some point: just at a wiser juncture than I have in the past. Before, the words would just kind of tumble out of me without my wanting them to. If I take better stock of the situation, I might save myself some pain. So if I don't see any hope of success, I will not spill my guts to some girl that's just going to arrange them in pagan symbols and set them on fire. Ahem ... But no, I will not hide behind some cowardly strategy. Damn, I guess I'm more dramatic than I feel tonight.
