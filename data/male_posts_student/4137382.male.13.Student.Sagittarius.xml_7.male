Anyone else, feel free to email me.  I have come across some problems with some of your posts, I would like to point them out to you in person. (via a thread or email or aim)  I would urge you to stop using terms like PonyHayStation Goo and Xbomb.  They do not help your argument, they just make you look like a bunch of uninformed kids.  I doubt that you are however.  Anyone who can, direct some of the 'TendOMFG guys or gals over here.  I am not sure they will see this...
