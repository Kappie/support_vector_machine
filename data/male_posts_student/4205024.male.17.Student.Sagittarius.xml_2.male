I went to all the exams, and wrote as much as I felt I could. I went home, and have breezed through those last weeks of college. And it's just hit me. these exams decide whether I get back to school and what university I go to, and on friday, I find out whether I have wasted 12 months and will become a bin man.  I always seem to do this. I can't motivate myself properly, but I know that work has to get done, so of course, I end up scared to death that my life was a waste (how ironic). Worst, I'm bummed anyway, because all this time I was right, and I'm currently doomed to being single, so can't even look forward to the post exam drinking!!!  I shouldn't complain really. Harry shuttleworth will be kept happy, as his CD has become the soundtrack to my breakup, and will from now on be a big part of my life when happy or depressed, and A Girl actually invited me out after results are opened, so that should be good (albeit in a group, but it's better than nowt)  Still listening to HS's EP, but who can blame me.  have fun guys x
