As in most playoff fixtures, there wasn't much to choose between. Both sides haven't really got this far before. Tampa Bay had a far better season, winning the Eastern conference. Calgary qualified in 6th Western place, but pulled together and smashed through opponents like the Detroit Red Wings and the San Jose Sharks. So stat wise they're about dead even. Onto the game...  The game started well for the Flames. With just 3:02 gone in the 1st period, Craig Conroy's shot from the blueline deflected off Tampa defender Dave Andreychuk, then off Flames' forward Martin Gelinas, to trickle past Khabibulin.  In the 2nd period, things got even better for Calgary. Jarome Iginla, favourite to get half the playoff awards this year, scored shorthanded. Stephane Yelle made it 3 on 18 minutes.   Tampa Bay managed to pull a powerplay goal back in the 3rd, and it was hardly likely to be from anyone else...yeap. Martin St. Louis struck again.   Then, with 20 seconds to go, the Flames really took the piss by scoring a really weak goal. 2 Flames managed to break away, they passed the puck between each other, then Chris Simon tapped it past "The Bulin Wall" to make it 4-1, and 1-0 overall for the Flames.
