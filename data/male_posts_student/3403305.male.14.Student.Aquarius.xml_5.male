I don't know if my parents read this, but if they do, I don't care. For about 4 days straight I was having suicidal thoughts. It took my two best friends awhile to calm me down. I wish I would have known Bobbie cared about me that much, if I would have, I wouldn't have had those thoughts, I think. I made a promise to her that I won't hurt myself as long as she's there for me. So yeah, I wish I would have cleared something up before I made that promise, sometimes hurting myself a little helps me pass time. No, I don't carve into my arm, just a little hit with a chain over my arm or something. Well, now that I'm thinking about it again, it's bringing back pain. I'm gonna go for a bit.
