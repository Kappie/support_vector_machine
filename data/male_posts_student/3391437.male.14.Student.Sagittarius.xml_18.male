Through the years, many people have created many different search engines using different algorithms.     One of the most popular search engines today are Google and Yahoo. Google launched on the internet about three years ago. It has gained popularity over millions of users. Yahoo has lost its fame throughout the years because google has taken over.     I think google search engine is the best search engine because it uses one of the best searching algorithms and the search engine works like a speeding bullet. Type in anything you want, Google will search 3 million web sites for you in less than 0.15 seconds. 15 Seconds if that’s not fast, what is? Yahoo is not even close to this number.
