Because we all have some idea of what a crime is, and what a contract is, but none of us (at least not me) has any clue that there are rules about what court you can sue someone in, and they depend on where you're from, and where he's from, and whether the case is about your car that rolled down a mountain from Vermont into New Hampshire.  Or the other way around.  Civ Pro is about court rules.  I'm not selling it very well here, am I?
