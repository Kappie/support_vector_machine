I mean, she was my absolute favorite relative, and saying some melodramatic bullshit like "Oh, I'll remember the good moments" is some serious bullshit.  I didn't like her for good things, I liked her because she spoke her mind, and she'd do it consistently.  I'd leave her house feeling pretty good sometimes, and I'd leave it feeling like shit sometimes.    That's not what I'm worried about.  I feel bad when I see other people sad about it.  Nia seems to just be getting that through, I know Moms been falling apart.  Dad's known Aunt Susan since High School (infact he knew her before he knew my mom) and Grammy lost one of her own kids.  But the real person I feel sad thinking about is Lauren.  Fortunately, she's out of college, but she's been orphaned at 20, which puts her in an extremely awkward posistion.    To add to the sucking, most of my friends knew her as well.  I mean, if you knew her and are reading this you probubly feel a bit sucky as well.  So tommorow, when I tell my teachers I could do no homework, I'll have to accept there pity for my aunt dying.  I don't want pity, I didn't die and it's no one's fault.  Of anything, I'm feeling slightly, bitter, which could just be me expressing emotions.  I've thought about it all day, how I should react if she were to die, I figured being emotionless about it would be pointless, and crying accomplishes nothing, but being angry, I guess it drives me to accomplish things.  Pissed off people get stuff done.    The funeral, I don't really want to attend.  My moms side of the family doesn't get cremated, so I probubly would feel worse seeing my aunt's dead face.  That would seriously suck, considering she was lively enough on Saturday.  Being the so called "Chaplan" of the family, I know I'm going to have to give a bible verse, which I'm not going to do.  I'm not going to just say "God let's us suffer, accept it, be happy, worship, suffer, die."  I've not been like that for awhile.  I'm going to be a realist.  I don't believe, and haven't believed, that "God" is some perfect omnipotent being in the sky.  A perfect God, makes a perfect Universe.  An imperfect God, makes an imperfect universe.  Anyone who can show me how pain and suffering fit into God's divine plan please tell me.  Please tell me why, we have to suffer under some sick form of Chattel Slavery, because some woman wanted to elevate her level of intelligence, and bring her man along for the ride.  Just explain to me, how us gaining wisdom is a bad thing?  Whatever.   I'll plan up what I'm going to say on Thursday, and if I'm lucky, I'll get to see Jacob (who was fortunately spurred on by Aunt Susan to go to College).
