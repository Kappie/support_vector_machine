A C-Section scar is the least of her cosmetic concerns.  I haven't made up my mind yet.  As much as I despise what she has done, I'm still not sure about it.  My instinct is to accord the fetus protection rights.  But I understand that the issue hinges once again on when does the fetus become a person a la abortion debate.  Personally, I'm utterly opposed to abortion.  But I'm not ready to codify my opposition into federal law.  I'd rather see Roe overturned and let each state handle it individually.    But I still don't know how I would prefer to see the law written.  There is the viability issue.  I think when you have viability, then the fetus transitions to a child and has rights.  But what is that point?  When do we define viability?  It will always be arbitrary and changing with technology.  No good answer.  But outside of the legal issues, this woman should have the crap beat out of her.
