I ate duck porridge for breakfast, then watched meowing cartoons to meow. Yes. Even Pokemons meowed at Unown! At 11, I went offline and started preparing to go out.  Hmm. I met Gloria and HL at 11.15 at the bus-meowing-stop and we took the bus to the basketball court near WQ's place. Hmm. I saw CQ, KS, PY and GaoLuan there (GL was there? O.O). HaHa. I brought the gas pump to pump CQ's basketball. Hmmm. By the way, I didn't say I need people to carry. It was heavy, but I can deal with it. Hmp. Oh yes, WQ visited us before going to the IT Show. Hmmm. Coolies.  We started playing lor. Hmm. GL was counting the score. We were kinda uneasy with that, because we don't even play that seriously. Hmm. Whatever lor. After a while, we took a break. The rest went to buy water, while me and CQ stayed behind to meow. We meowed and meowed and meowed. Ergh. Things were left untold. Yes!! Even ducks mooed. They came back and we played some more. We played till 2 something lor. Yes yes.  Okay. After that, we went to Causeway Point to eat lor. KS changed clothes, Joyce brought some medicine thingy, KS brought newspaper. We met GL and went up to the foodcourt to eat. We chose the long table thingy and I sat at the head, so I appointed myself zhu xi (CEO). Yes! Even the zhu xi meowed. I ate mian feng guo. Even the zhu xi was impreched at the end of the day because he didn't treat his staff to lunch and pool. How meowful is that? Very!  Yep. We went pooling. We met ThongZhen, John and Kenny there. Hmm. We played pool!! O.O! WQ joined us later. Apparently, he has a bad experience at the IT Show. I think it has something to do with not subscribing to StarHub's broadband service. Oh well. He refused to tell me anything though. Meow moo meow! We played and meowed till 4 something.  Hmmm. After that, the rest went home while me, Joyce, WQ and KS went to the library. Joyce wanted to borrow book, and since I am bookless at the moment, I might as well borrow some. Even ducks borrowed three books. I hope to own the "Meet Me On The QE2" someday! A classic!  After that, we went to the pasar malam, only for a short while though. We decided to go back. Hmm. I accompanied WQ, Joyce and KS to take 911. HaHa. I got slapped for telling WQ it is bad luck to walk besides a funeral. HAHAHAHA! You!! I got down at the next stop with Joyce and walked to her house. We meowed a lot of things. Anyway, I took the train home and then took 913 home. HaHa. Wastage of moolah. :P I like wasting moolah! :D  Coming back, I bathed, went online for awhile, then went off to eat and meowed at my show. Even the show is meowful!!! Yes! After eating, I came back online. Meow moo!! Where are the cats!! We are supposed to discuss the time of meeting tomorrow! As meowing ducks, they should be punctual!  Okay. I think I end off this blog. See ya tomorrow! Night blog!
