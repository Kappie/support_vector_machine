"Maybe it's because George Bush is relaxing at his ranch down there (again) while Osama is planning a big attack up here (again)."    This is the voice of an irritated child, angry that daddy isn't paying attention to her personal melodrama of the moment.  Is she really so naive to think that the country shuts down when Bush is on 'vacation'?  Does she have any concept of how much work gets done on a presidential vacation?  Is she really so stupid?  Perhaps.
