And after the lesson would be home sweet home. BUt sad to say, as usual, all my classmates came into class at 9am, waiting for the teacher, Mr Alan Tan to come in to mark attendance and carry on with the lesson, but to everyone's suprise, another teacher came in and told the class that Mr Alan Tan took urgent leave and that the class would be cancelled.  U guys must be thinking that we were be very happy to hear that, but NO.. most of the class's face turn black, as they have to travel from the east to school early in the morning, having to wake up at 0530 or later. and in the end find the teacher not in class. Whew, lucky for me, i stayed nearby..   Well, as for the gd part of the day was that i got the cashier job at carrefour and today went over to Suntec to collect my uniform and also tookthe photo for the staff pass. And would be starting work on monday, lets hope that class would end early on monday, as i dont wish to be late for work on the 1st day.   Well, think that's all for today, shall report farer abt my life tomolo. Tomolo morning still got practical lesson and also i would be working at FISH  CO tomolo too.   Cheer and till then Thomas
