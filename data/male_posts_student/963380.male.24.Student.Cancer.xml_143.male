It sucked something proper.  I think I'm going to start a new website (I'm still working on my other one too - another-castle.net) about Canadian Politics. I get far too angry about things in the country at the municipal, provincial and federal level not to do anything about it. I've got some things down - when I get them to make sense, I'll share them with you here.
